How long ago was this? Could just be taking a while, there is a massive amount of transactions going on today

only up 450% this year with the crash, definitely dying :P

your argument is that it wouldn't offset the electrical cost, im just saying that is false. he will not loose money just running it, and most equipment will pay for itself within the year if the coins keep any reasonable value that they currently have.

I would give it a little more time, i'm not saying its there, but to take a deep breath and relax. There has been a massive increase in bitcoins transactions, im sure some of the smaller exchanges could be running into issues. My wallet for example today took forever to sync compared to normal when I sent some coins from coinbase

how long has it been since you tried to withdrawal the bitcoin?

so? the one he was looking at is even more profitable, that one generates like $600 a month in bitcoin and only cost a third the price

Yes you can transfer it into a regular US account. I believe you would have to pay a capital gains tax regardless of the asset that you profited off of.

coinbase accepts paypal, they have been having some issues with it though recently

Is your bank account in US dollars?    
I dont see why you couldn't link your account through coinbase or some other exchange if its not on their banned country list, it will just be up to your bank if they offer USD based accounts.

= hash rate 220/MH/s, their hosting plan is .07 KW/H   
= 1.47 ethereum a month for $50 a month of electricity, or $300 a month profit at the current post crash rates. sure its a large upfront investment, but it will pay for itself in 5-10 months then its all profit from there.

maybe there is just a low volumes of trades on the site and those are just peoples limit orders in case they hit unreasonable levels.

This mining service makes you pay in RMB. I don't see why it would be hard for others to charge fiat currencies for the electrical cost.
