Feels like you are one of the few person to not mix up Currency Regulation and Exchange/Broker regulations.

this looks fun but i don't fully understand...
like here:
"Liquidated long on ETHZ17: Sell 49 @ 0.03761"
Is "he" liquidating the 49 ETH of someone who shorted (btc?) for 0.03761 btc each?

well it could be ofcourse, but imo demand is still growing much faster than supply so the Feedback Loop is still running. Of Course this can Change quik but i think the big one is still a year or so away.

Very sorry to hear this, all the best to you and your family.
Do not get upset about missed opportunity - life is literally full of them, you miss chances left or right every second.
Everything look obvious  in hindsight - but you did not have the information before so there is nothing to blame.
Might aswell be upset you didn't get the lottery numbers right.

emotions are not your friends when investing, they will often give you the worst imput. That plus dont invest more than you are willing to lose.

The fork failed, but instead of failing because there isn't enough support i think it failed because of a programming error?
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:39:44
because they dont affect you in the slightest?
