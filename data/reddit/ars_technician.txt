Did you forget the part where they fix bugs? A security bug in a currency exchange isn't something that can sit around for "a month or two".

Swing and a miss.
Shares can be both non-voting and non-dividend paying. Their only purpose is to hope for capital appreciation.

Mt gox would not logically rate limit trades on a trade based commission.

JP Morgan wasn't an exchange. MT Gox has no reason to take on all of this risk. They are making money whether it trades at $30 or $300 and the market still functions.
There are no banks that are becoming insolvent because of this, the blockchain is not at risk. There is no point to a floor.

You missed the whole point. The guy got the family a gift HE thought was important based on HIS perception of the future. It's exactly the same thing as a religious nut getting everyone bibles because HE thinks it's really important based on HIS perception of the future. 
Gifts are supposed to be based on what the recipient likes, not what YOU think is best for the recipient based on YOUR perception of the future. 
Edit: really? This sub has degraded to the point where people can't even come up with counter-arguments so they silently downvote?

That's exactly what government regulation tries to do...

No, many people see it as a shallow gift because it shows that you didn't know the person well enough to get them something they would like. 
Even if they do like money, then why not get them a currency accepted by the stores they visit? The Japanese Yen has been deflationary so it's a nice place to store money, but I don't get it for my cousins for Christmas.

It does. You are just butthurt because you bought into it as a get-rich-quick scheme and you paid the price. 
Can I interest you in some Russian rubles? You buying them makes as much sense as buying bitcoin without any intent to use it.

Let me repeat. "Shares can be both non-voting and non-dividend paying."
You say a bond or security has value. A bond maybe, but securities can be easily arranged where you don't get so much as a wink during bankruptcy. In that light, bitcoin is better because it can't be diluted and it doesn't depend on some underlying company.

Regulation is rules. Look up the definition. 
You say you aren't talking about regulation, but you are. I'm not sure what the distinction you are trying to make is.
