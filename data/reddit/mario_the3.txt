This is a video I’m trying to put together for my website. There’s a lot of built up around the box and the last scene definitely needs some sort of after effect . I was thinking maybe a portal? Or lighting coming out of the box or breaking the ground? Pls help with suggestions or critiques. And if you know how to use after effects shot me a message!

Agreed, based on the information you provided it seems you’re good with finances. Also the fact that you’re posting on here asking for different prospectives. 
I don’t suggest buying anything on credit. Bitcoin is LIKELY to continue to climb as we appear to enter another bull market based on several indicators and historical price range. HOWEVER, nothing in life is a guaranteed; except death and taxes. 
Alt coins are attractive due to their low market cap; they can possibly bring a bigger ROI. But based on history, Bitcoin has been and will continue to be king. I personally would keep majority of my portfolio allocated in BTC. Big players are stepping into the space soon and their money is going to BTC before anything else.
