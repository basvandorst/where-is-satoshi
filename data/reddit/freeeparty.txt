Human work has value in beer as well as fiat or bitcoin.  What I am suggesting with virtual currency is its use as a great equalizer for laborers or makers on the global scale.  The idea that everything has a price on it is confused when viewed through the eyes of globalization.  How can a human living in the tropics have 1/10 the value for his work as that of a city dweller?  Because of the political pressure on the local currency and culture of historic slavery through colonialism.  Virtual currency is independant of that, so we say, even though all the effort to determine its value is understood through our understanding of the dollar.  Its like a group of guys talking about women and trying to understand their nuance without ever being able to view things from a female perspective.  They are similar yet different, comlpetely.
This wave of thought goes beyond the LTV and Marxism because it allows for free market capitalism, something none of us have ever experiences but is now possible in an decentralized and unregulated valued currency.  VC considers the gloabal network of resources as well because it is a level playing field.  A is A as they say, just like the Turkish Lira or Argentine Peso is a legitimate currency one day and toilet paper the next.  If there is a crash, it affects everyone and not just people living with corrupt leadership.
Back to my central question, what is the value of a btc in terms of human work?  If the world of 6 billion people was fully employed and compensated in btc would that be a more accurate description of its value (and human goal) than comparing the value of one to an ounce of gold?  So logically everything has a price on it, understood, but why put a price on the alternative in terms of the past?  We can do better, no???
