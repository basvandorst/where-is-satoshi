Well damn, this is nice and all but that means every merchant has to learn about bitcoin and be okay with it then go through the trouble of making an account buying new terminals and training employees. This is an awesome step in the right direction but I was somehow hoping for a seemless firmware update that magically turned my bitcoin into cash for the merchant without them having to go through a huge process.

I don’t really know much about bitcoin. I know the blockchain is becoming substantially large.  Couldn’t there be like an annual “service pack” like windows? Say we compress a years worth of transactions and make it optional to use server side. But once a new service pack is started just make an index of every balance instead of a record of every single transaction. 
I’m also lacking sleep so sorry I didnt explain that well.
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:14:11
That’s what I meant.  Bitcoin could run on a “B” network mode while its being compressed and indexed. Then merge the new transactions back over when you switch back to network “A”

Currently we do not have a high volume, just a few every week at max.  I was looking at bitpay earlier, I stopped because in order to make an account to see how they work I need to provide business information.  I'm not going to make an account there without permission of my boss.
Would it work to make a fake account there just to try out how the code works?  Or would that cause problems.

So once we hit that 21 million bitcoin limit, is mining going to become impossible?  EDIT:   The way I think of it is that mining is how we "print" bitcoins.  Also, as far as I know there is a maximum at how many bitcoins will ever exist (I think we're at 10 million?)  So once we can no longer print bitcoins, wouldnt mining have no benefit?  Making these transactions have no benefit to be verified.
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:07:36
A little, but not a lot of profit.  How much would you say is needed to record it?
Also, I don't know at what price I bought it at or exactly how many bitcoins were bought.  So it's a bit of a lost cause when I only have the amount I paid.

Anonymity isn't a key feature in Bitcoin for use with crime.  It's a feature so you don't always need to give all of your information to the merchant.  It's like handing over cash with a mask on.  You could still take off the mask, but on the surface its anonymous.

You seem to be getting slammed with downvotes.  I'm genuinely curious about your stance on smartphones.  I just want to know why you feel like this, PM me if you care to explain without all the downvotes.

It's strange to me why they even try if they just rip off source code and just hope by luck that it'll work.
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:09:22
It was a few weeks ago I saw one reddit post.  So it's probably minor or user error.
edit:  [I guess after reading the post again](  It was a specific problem with his machine.

Thats genius!  Why have so many other digital "coin" currencies failed?  Where bitcoin seems to be popular.

I don't know where to start on figuring out how I can make my web server listen for callbacks. It's just a small website. The PayPal buttons let me add my own fields into that order, then that info would be displayed on the confirmation email PayPal sends me. Can I do this with Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:16:45
Couldn't Bitcoin be updated to allow this without much pissed off users?

If you're not a developer don't bother.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:15:36
This isn't the right place for this conversation but, I think you took one look at an iPhone and said fuck it for all smartphones.  Android is incredibly open.  I personally prefer iOS but I must have it jailbroken.  There is tons of demand for it so it's usually available for every device quickly.  If you were a developer you would be able to understand what things are actually possible on a smartphone.  Also, Apple and Google don't make the apps in their store, nor do they control the prices.  Developers who freely chose their platform make their apps on that platform and sell it at a price they choose that fits in the app market.

Gayphones? Not sure if your referring to iOS or android.  They're both great platforms

Calm down. Fast being hours to transfer digitally instead of days, free being that the fee is totally optional altho recommended. Anonymous being there is no place to look up the true identity of a bitcoin address. All of these things are possible with bitcoin.

What does high risk even mean?  It says to protect against fraud, but I don't understand why it would be considered high risk of fraud only because the price changed so much.

I couldn't even use it.  My 5s seemed to lag a little when I tried to login.  Every time I would try to select the email field the keyboard would appear but quickly disappear.  It seemed to count each failed attempt as a login attempt.  When I finally managed to keep my keyboard up it said I attempted to log in too many times and need to try in a few hours.

Transfer your coins to an exchange of your choice, like Mt. Gox.  They do bank transfers or via Dwolla.  Dwolla has tons of options, if I remember right they can pay you with paypal.
edit:  Coinbase is probably the easiest.
