It's sad that your explanation of the situation is so far down the page.  You're dead on and this is probably what everyone's saying when they say "technically, they don't accept bitcoin".  They don't.  The people here circle jerking shouldn't be any happier about this because it does nothing for bitcoin except make it easier to spend.  Ideally, you'd want business actually using the currency.

Any reason why you're just spamming the same comment over and over when it has nothing to do with what actually happened or how any security was breached?

I get what you're saying, but iPhoto keeps telling me that Satoshi and Dorian are the same person...  My iPhoto must be broken.

Except that's not at all how it happened and the Find My iPhone hole required you to know the login info of the account.  Also, it's been patched.  This means nothing for any new announcements.

Yes it does.  Both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus have NFC.

Simple.com just got bought out by a bigger bank. Unfortunately, I don't think you'll have luck there either.

I feel like that's a completely misdirected argument.  Are you telling me that your family doesn't know how to email a photo to themselves or they can't figure out AirDrop?  I'd wager that transferring files to and from an iPhone is easier because there's no cable to use.  You don't need iTunes for an iPhone *at all* anymore.  It seems you're mad at Apple for something that is not only not their fault but something that they've made strides to make better.  Lazy people are lazy people.

Dumbed down is not the same as simple.  People want (and got) simple interfaces from Apple.  There's nothing dumb about the OS X UI.

Sorry, but that's, to be frank, complete horseshit.  You're seriously trying to suggest that the majority of PC users troubleshoot their own problems and don't need a "techie" person to help them out?
The reason Apple has earned the stereotype of tech for non-techies is because it lowered the cost of admission for people that couldn't use technology.  *Everyone* is a non-techie until they learn to use a computer and, even then, most people only learn the mere basics of what they need to know to get their job/task done.  What you're suggesting is that either PC users troubleshoot their own issues without outside help or they just give up and don't use a computer.
I don't even think you realize how smug and silly your response is.  "I just know it's a thing".  No, it's not.  You're just too self-centered to not realize that you're describing a textbook case of confirmation bias.

This is simultaneously one of the most pretentious and most asinine comments I've seen on reddit.  Simplifying a user interface is not dumbing it down.  I would really love to hear some examples of where the interface is "dumbed down" more than Windows or Linux.

No it's not.  Normal people don't use Linux.  I use it as a dev, but no one else in my family has used it and I've installed it on their machines.  They ask me to re-install Windows after less than 2 weeks every time.  Even Ubuntu just isn't usable enough for them.  With all the advances they've made in the UI, it's still a generally terrible experience.
