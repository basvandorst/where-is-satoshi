Here's a useful chart that shows the future supply curve of Bitcoin. It's dynamically updated based on current block height.

Our median fee of $0.1 \- $0.2 per tx is at about [Jun\-Dec 2016 levels]( So I suppose it depends on what timescale you're looking at.

Blocks are about 5&amp; faster per quarter than they should be over the last 2 years. But hashrate has been growing by 40\-50&amp; per quarter over the last 2 years.
You can think of the difference as the "slippage" or inability of the difficulty adjustments to keep up with hashrate. Difficulty adjustment always take place **after** hashrate has been increasing. So it's always playing catch\-up.
If you measure the hashrate growth every 2\-weeks over the same two years I get 6&amp; growth, so it almost perfectly matches up with the difference in block speed.

The assumption is that hashpower\-providers are paying their expenses in fiat, not BTC. Electricity and equipment cost are both factors, but I'm not trying to do a complete analysis here, just make some estimates to get people thinking.
Again, most people think we have 100 years to solve these problems, we don't. Weaning the community off of the inflation subsidy is a big challenge that more people should be talking about.

For anyone who thinks this is a good thing... it's probably not.
Bitcoin does [roughly 2,500 tx/block]( \(we could increase it, but that's a tradeoff with chain size\). So our throughput is relatively fixed, but we need to pay miners for hashpower. Most people think we have 100 years to solve this because of the inflation subsidy, but in fact it's dwindling very fast.
In just 10 years, [by the 2028 halving]( 97&amp; of all bitcoins will have been mined and inflation will be at \~0.4&amp; The block reward will be 1.56 BTC/block.
Currently miners are making [$90k \- $100k per block]( from block rewards. Fees on the other hand only add up to around [$500 \- $2000 per block]( That's a huge difference \- only roughly 1&amp; of miner reward is currently fees.
What happens when the block reward is 1.56? Well many people are banking on the idea that the price continues to increase. But what if it doesn't, or not enough? Let's say the price is $50k/BTC in 2028. That means the block reward would be $78k, and you would need an additional $23k just to match **today's** miner reward per block. That calculates to $9.2 per transaction, assuming 2,500 tx/block.
We should be preparing the community for the possible future of high fees to secure the network \(a "future" that may be less than 10 years away\).
You can actually draw a chart of the required fees at each halving, which I've done here: [imgur]( Again, this all assumes you want to match today's miner reward, but perhaps it needs to be higher in the future to secure the network.
Some mitigating factors: bitcoin price keeps increasing, or the tx/block increases, or the required miner reward to secure the network decreases.

What I meant by "probably not a good thing" is just the idea of low fees in general, which is not likely to be our future state imo. I don't think the community should get used to something that is not likely to stick around.


The problem isn't the decreased profitability, which is inevitable in any competitive market. It's the fact that we could run into a scenario where we are losing hashpower and therefore network security if miner rewards aren't high enough.
Within 10\-20 years bitcoin has to become self\-sustaining off fee rewards alone. We may have some increase to throughput by then, but in general it's fair to say tx fees will be high.

The mining speed of blocks is slightly faster than 10 min/block. You're right that the difficulty will keep adjusting, but since hashrate is constantly increasing, the 2016 block \(2\-week\) adjustment period is usually less than 2 weeks. So we're mining at a rate of slightly faster than 10 min/block.
Let's look at the data. On this chart you can see the height and daily rate of growth of the chain: [
As you can see, it's usually more than 144 blocks, which means it's faster than 10 min blocks. In the top right corner you can download the data. I averaged every quarter since 2013. **Every quarter has faster than 10\-min blocks.**

Thanks, I appreciate it. Great site yourself.

A couple criticisms/suggestions.
* The website requires creating an account. This is friction that [satoshis.place]( doesn't have
* You have to buy "credits" but it's unclear how many pixels that gets you. So for example I can buy 1000 credits for 100 satoshi, but how many pixels can I paint? It's confusing.

Very cool, thanks for the reply. I’ll check out your site for sure.

Frankly I think it's just a proof of concept at this point. It's similar to [earn.com]( where you might have access to contact someone you otherwise wouldn't.

That's because you're comparing apples and oranges. Paypal has setup time too, just as any credit or debit card does. Once you have it setup then of course it's easy to use.

[Transactions per block]( looks good too:
* Dec 14, 2017: 2,809 tx, 8% segwit
* Feb 05, 2019: 2,735 tx, 32% segwit
