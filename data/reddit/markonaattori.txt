I don't know is this yet big dump or not. Don't know how many times bitcoin has dropped or rise 10% at short time. I would ques 40+-10 times. Yesterday was one( well 15%, but its at same area maybe), thought longer 3 month drop is around 40% .
So not sure is this gonna be real dump or one many moves. Now it look that course is going up fast, but could be down to 8300 again after 5 min. Anyways 8500$ now.

I bought 10 coins at 0.05$ and I will hodl until it reaches 7 zillionbillion dollars, then I sell some. Up to that I think I am senior investor and capable to give instructions... Its kind of say hodl, but also means that I am superior.

I made my first invest about 6h before crash. Kind of bad moment, but on the other hand 2-3 week ago course was much higher allmost 20%. Course went slowly down all the time several weeks.
Still I was wondering that how course goes now? Sure I feel like I need to sell and got 20% more bit later by buying. Anyhow I would feel like idiot if course goes up and I have bought high and sold low. ( now 8300$ and been so practically 24h ).
I got time as said ( also bit bitcoin value ). What you think is it making another dump or does it begun to go up. Now it seems to go back to earlier state as it is stable. But is next move up or down? 
My thought is that it is to one direction and propably fast ( 20 min to 2h ). Was thinking that it happens around now like yesterday, so kind of waiting. Anyhow I rather hodl than sell.
Is there possibility to get 10-40% more bitcoins by selling now and buying later or just wait when sweet coin goes up.

Why many of you speculate does bitcoin be here? You and I have paid real money to get it, so there is huge mountain of real money behind this coin. Its not virtual at that way. Yes it should fight against fiat money etc, but to get it you have to use fiat money and mountain of fiat money just grows. At this moment it is 147B$ and it grows or goes down. Price you buy it is price at that moment at market, but you have to pay to get it or some might get it by doing work, those are minority.
I would speculate only value of it not that does it exist as it will for sure. What is it value, thats the question, anyhow now I go to sleep.
