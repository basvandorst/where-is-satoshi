Dont be such a meanie to BTC. It is funny though.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:05:39
When it made it to ~$40 (above the older all time high) I thought it would go down and rest a while.
Instead BTC started a HUGE Rally.
These markets are crazy, and still fun.

Worst case scenario could be that he makes good on his promise; never know with people these days.
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:13:08
As for whether I want him/them being exposed, I'm not sure and it's a double-edged sword. If he was revealed all of the enigma and mystery surrounding him would instantly dissapear. I imagine it'd be better to remain anonymous ultimately, but I would like to know more about the mysterious creator(s).

Does anyone knows if i buy one of this machines, do insurance companies secur it?

ShapeShift, another sponsor of the contest, is a great exchange service - so far, the best from my experience.
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:47:31
I was afraid of this...
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:15:52
In concept, great.  In practice, a disaster.  What happens when someone hacks the Winklevoss and steals all the BTC?  Are they going to guarantee the principal?

Why is twobitidiot on Twitter claiming this only applies to hot wallet?
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:02:24
Sorry, but I'm missing something here. I'm confused at how bitcoin is a solution for Paypal and digital goods? How does bitcoin solve this problem?
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:10:11
We can see the benefits of bitcoin, but will the mainstream fully? I'm not so sure.
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:49:08
I think that Bitcoin in places like Africa would be more successful if fiat is not involved. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:15:19
How is going bitcoin to eradicate poverty?
Utter nonsense. There are going to be poor people , starving people even in a bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:14:00
Is it still working?
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:11:36
I don't feel he should be 'exposed' or forced into anything, but I'd only like him or them to reveal themselves if it was of their own choice and free will. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:05:04
Wow, I'm really surprised how quickly Bitcoin Foundation went down the slippery spiral.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:16:08
The fact transactions can't be reverses make any BTC investment pool, where a large group of investors share a common wallet, EXTREMELY risky.  See Gox.
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:12:15
I'm thinking of using this host for a website, but the servers will be seriously slow since BTC is maxing out the CPU on so many of their nodes....?
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:47:10
The best way to grow your Bitcoin portfolio is to work for a living and then set aside a % of your paycheck to scoop up Bitcoin with. This is the easiest and surest way for the average person to accumulate and maintain their coinage.
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:13:49
I like spagetti
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:46:20
Oh ok, I thought you could change the amount on physical coins wallet.  I didn't know their were set amounts that couldn't be changed if that is what your saying.  
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:19:54
Sounds like it could be an expensive giveaway - I think they are hoping many will do nothing with their free bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:12:47
They use OpenVZ which does not protect you from the "abuse" of other customers.
Thanks guys. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:50:46
This is exactly what we need to take Bitcoin to the next level. Not only for places to accept it, but to offer a substantial discount in BTC giving people an incentive to buy! Awesome news!
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:13:32
Can you mine bitcoins to an address where you only got the public key?
If only i had the private key i would maybe pay like 101 BTC for 100 BTC mined to my address.
So yes there could be a market
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:09:33
That image isn't really working for me. Nevermind Clicked it to enlarge. I guess bitcoin has a long way to go
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:15:44
well, BTC price only goes down :S
buy the rumor, sell the news. This is why news programs shouldn't mention bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:10:08
Sadly most people don't care about these things, just like they don't care about everything else: war, taxes, government etc. They just want to get on with their life with minimal fuss, but their unwillingness to buck the trend and cause a fuss is a big part of the problem. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:17:53
Its disruptive enough I have pondered a similar microtransaction model myself using Bitcoin but had puzzles finding a great utility for it this might work thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:18:36
It'd be better to imagine Bitcoin not as one big monolithic cirlce but as lots of small circles. Like on the famous picture with fishes 
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:46:40
At least 240,000 hotels started accepting bitcoin when Expedia started accepting it.
Whether they convert it to fiat or not, it has been great for paying for hotels for me (getting reimbursed by my company will be interesting).
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:16:51
I don't think they will be able to enforce this. The trading of bitcoin is simply too difficult to track by the police, especially when it is done in secret and not in the open
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:48:39
no it isn't because is decentralized, mining also is still decentralized, the definition of a ponzi is different
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:18:16
This is nothing new. It has been done before and will be done again. Not particularly smart or innovative. College student should get a job.
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:51:30
I didn't think about that, sounds like a nice extra layer of security. But make sure the questions are easily answerable with the same answer every single time.
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:44:25
I think that a year from now we will all be able to pay with bitcoin in the major shopping sites
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:01:14
With hash cloud on top... 
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:17:49
The question becomes if they can beat the revenue earned from ads on their website
For reddit to use it or another service as a microlending service it would need to compete as a better revenue stream than this 
That said the article and idea does interest me and I will have to read it more later 
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:08:55
Faggart? 
You'd think he'd change his name.
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:49:40
How can the free market ever be evil? Do you know what does free market mean? Do you know that in the free market only voluntary transactions, where every parts considers that wins, take place?
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:47:29
The next one should be Websters
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:48:05
People are used to money the way it is so why not give them that feel with btc.  A decentralized currency with a bank, maybe but I don't think any human is honest enough to run it like banks now. Problems are,
The owner still doesn't actually have their money anymore the bank does just like now.
What sort of 'guarantee' do we get that they don't print more that allowed?
Who owns the bank or banks?
Also would this bank get insurance on their private cold storage?
Interesting thread though, I will follow it and see what comes up.
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:24:45
They say MIT scientists can't take part. How come?
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:49:13
because they think it will save us from the great recession, dunno if this will come true but, bitcoin is doing well for now, it's a good safe-haven asset
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:51:51
Sure anonymous cryptocurrencies open some possibilities for terrorists, BUT it provides much more positive things for ordinary people who can effectively clean out all bad guys from it without gov "help"
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:18:13
Very cool. Hopefully we start seeing that more often in the US but with our puritan liquor laws it will take a while.
