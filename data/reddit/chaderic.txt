The point of Bitcoin is it’s open public ledger.  Ability to monitor the flow of governments blood money is key.

You’ll be carrying some new Iranian currency bags for a long time if you swap.  Hyper inflated money is not an asset.

It’s not meant to be a payment system.  It’s purpose is intended for decentralized cloud data storage that is impossible to hack.  Also, more coins doesn’t matter when they are divisible to 8 decimal places.  
The reason why sis isn’t considered for mainstream adoption is because it’s only like 2 years old and has a tiny user base.  You need something that has proven itself over time and has a large user base.
Sis is good project, just not a good currency.  The sis dev team should at least be on board with that idea at a bare minimum.

Maybe USD is just hyper inflating so fast that $6400 in  2020 is actually $10MM in 2018.

I agree with you and you mistyped “too”.  Sorry I’m a Nazi like trump, grammar Nazi.... 
Fuck political bullshit!  I’m tired of this tip toeing on ice, afraid to say the wrong thing or offend the wrong type of person.... he needs treated how the average American is treated, IMMEDIATELY.  He is a spoiled brat ass-wipe that needs to be disciplined for once in his life.  We (kindhearted people) need to rise up and put this demon in his place.

It all seems to be coming to a point around mid 2020.  Bitcoin logarithmic charts are playing out consistently, the halvening is approaching, the world is starting to understand how rare a satoshi is, dumb ass trump will be going to prison finally, stock market looking like a retracement is imminent, global recession predictions, capitalism has gone too far, plastic is contaminating the planet, C02 is going to kill everything on Earth... 
I think it will happen all in the same month, May 2020.  
Fun fact.... the best currency symbol for a satoshi is the $.  Think about it....

Remember, it’s owners currently owe 21 trillion of those and there is only an estimated $250,000,000 in circulation.  When it crashes hope your part of the 1% that make it to the ATM quick.  Again, $21,000,000,000,000.  Our last interest payment was almost as large as our total GDP.  Interest keeps on rising until we have an ever growing negative GDP.
Wouldn’t you rather instead have a piece of something that you undeniably own, backed by MATH? Seems to me you own a slice of a lot of debt.

Anyone hear of that new ICO? “Dollar”, or it’s token name “USD” has no cap on it’s circulating supply, fully centralized platform, inflationary, and zero security protocol.  It’s also accepted most places in the world!
Anyone here participating?

Buffet and some other billionaires just swapped half their assets a few months back for 100% cash.... however I am a firm believer that cash is worth what it is.... paper.  Asses are wiped with paper.  Personally, I’ve been snagging gold and silver as a slight hedge.

A military doesn’t work for free.  What do you pay them when a dollar is worthless and possibly non-existent? When that happens how will you protect your dollars and precious metals as you carry them to purchase goods?  I’d rather choose a method where no person or government can take it away from me.  Do what you want man, you cannot convince me otherwise.
