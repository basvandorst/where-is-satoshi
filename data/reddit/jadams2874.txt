You should of said, well its possible for someone to beat someone to death with a graphics card so people will do it.  So should we look down of your product cause someone can murder with it???
I hate the argument that terrorist can use it..... Terrorist use shirts, pants, and shoes. We should look down and ban exporting clothing...
EDIT:  Arctic Accelero VGA cooler, those are the best non-water cooled but the MSI graphics cards are known for coil whining during fan activity ( I have 2x270x and 1x280x MSI)

I dont know if I can brute force a wallet but if you ever have a hard drive die. I do data recovery in my shop everyday to recover all the data where the wallet is saved if ever in that dire of a situation. Glad to hear this all turned out well for you!!

Oh yea, because chewing tobacco effects typing?  Im sorry for my grammatical errors that offended you.
I didnt say it isnt alive and well, Im saying the close-knit community this subreddit use to have is almost non-existent. I never said anything about me personally not getting tips, I am talking about the topic of this post. Also I wasnt complaining, I stated what I have seen over the change in this subreddit over the past 6 months. No need to get butthurt and start tossing insults, and ranting because you do not agree with what I said. However, I do not care for someone who has only been here for 2 months cross-questioning statements referring to a period before you actively observed or even existed within this subreddit. This is 1 of a couple reddit accounts I use, due to certain ones are dedicated to personal and professional use so please defer any other comments to someone who cares

I thought that was going to be a lot worse then it was when I saw FOX, but I persevered and I think he had a good outlook on Bitcoin and they focused more on flaws of current payment standards.

I love LibreOffice as a computer technician, I suggest it to everyone because it is such a great thing that many do not know about. The equivalent of Microsoft Office for free, which could save millions of people a 100 bucks a year or every couple. I am loving them even more now that they will take my Bitcoins!!

I wonder if the British hacker group has turned there Low Orbit Ion Cannon from "Hacktivists" to focus on disassembling Bitcoin

Im not saying current alt coins, innovation in the past year has produced so many variations and out there onces. Planning longer term, decard, couple years, who knows. Etherium is mind blowing when you grasp the revolution of the blockchain protocol for future technology and networks.

Well here are the facts.
1. Tipping in Bitcoin use to be an everyday thing within this community 6 months, since Bitcoin gained more fiat value and publicity, more people have jumped on the wagon. These new people are not tipping and the old community has stopped tipping
2. The "Bitcoin Community" does not exist as it once did when people would help each other, and were always looking out for each other. It has morphed into an investor frenzy with everyone out for their own greed.
3. I wish it was, as it once was.

If fiat currency collapsed, we would be fucked either way. Because at that point it isnt just a matter of money it means the foundations of every government have broken down and the world would probably be a FFA Walking Dead style

Well the avg Bitcointip has been raised since back in the day we would send .6 or 1 btc like it was no big deal, but this is calculating all the bitcoin tips at the current market value even the tips that were processed when Bitcoin was only 75 bucks

I mean technically Doge has always been worth essentially 0 cents for 1, just joking shibes haha. We all have to take these "Statistics" with skepticism, because of course this is the internet and no matter how much we don't like it, everything on it isn't a fact : ( Sad Internet Panda
Yes! Bitcoin tipping was banned/very frowned upon from almost every major subreddit, because people had similar views on it as Doge tipping within the Bitcoin subreddit. (They share a more common basis ,but overall 1 subreddit does not want the intrusion of the other)

Bitcoin cast an umbrella over all alt coins, so banning all together  is shunning a necessary asset to crypto currencies in general.  Bitcoin is the foundation that all future coins will be derived and spawned from its original idea.  The Elite mentality lately by some in this subreddit is a disgrace to why Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to introduce and spread this technological revolution so that it could be innovated, wide-spread, and a utility for everyone to make use of.  If one does not accept an embrace alt coins then bitcoin has no future because when the time comes an alt coin will pre-vale on top of all other digital currencies due to someone innovating protocol to be more regulatible with no possible faults ,but it will always have started with bitcoin and it will go down in history as the spark that started it all.
TLDR: Bitcoin is the father of all alt coins, and they play an integral part in the image and future of cryptos. Altcoins are simply the next level to what bitcoin started.

The front page of any subreddit does not mean its news, this subreddit is for anything Bitcoin related not just a news feed of the latest happenings. This can have Bitcoin art, fundraisers, jokes, or anything that Bitcoin encompasses, but a front page does not dictate that everything on it is news.

My friend and I started a Non-Profit because we were so interested in Bitcoin.  Then we developed the love for this currency into how can I spread the word to the people elsewhere who need a financial system like this, if you asked me 1 year ago if I would of been running a Non-Profit and helping people in Africa, I would laughed in your face.  Bitcoin has been such a positive light in my life and has allowed me to help people half way around the world from an office. Bitcoin allows us to help others which we love to do, and was the foundation that allowed us to turn that into an actual business. All the entrepeneurs I met at the Miami Conference was an amazing example of this also

I completely agree with you, another factor is that many of us Early-Adopters have moved onto more serious endeavors. I also understand where you are coming from about contributing to efforts hosted elsewhere. Ex: I started a cryptocurrency funded and operated Non-Profit in December, we are licensed in the US and are focused on educating people world wide and in developing currencies about the benefits of cryptos. I started this because I believed that developing countries and elsewhere around the world have more of a necessity for this technology then say the US with an established Banking and Money Transfer industry.

I dont go to a website to see their ads, I go for the content. As a computer technician, ads and pop-ups are in the top 5 causes of computer infections, so I dont leave my guard down. Of course ads trail behind user error and emails.

Or the immature/spazzoid redditors who have a rage-fit whenever another altcoin is mentioned anywhere in this subreddit like its sac-religious can just down vote or keep scrolling.
Bitcoin and all other altcoins are in the same boat and will always have some correlation due to the same foundations and the integration correlated between bitcoin trading within altcoin systems. If you don't like altcoins but believe in bitcoin....your simply a hypocrite.
