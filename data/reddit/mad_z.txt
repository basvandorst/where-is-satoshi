Bought from your site multiple times before, just want to say thank you for being legit and dependable over the years unlike most other sellers.

It is also worth noting that all bids that have been revealed were either well under or only slightly over market price, at least is means they sold for more than market price, but we really don't know how much more.

Even if the game is delivered, .0492 BTC for Borderlands 2 is pretty much a scam when it is $30 on Steam.

Except you can withdraw your coins from just-dice without any problems.

Yep, I had the stuff saved in notepad to actually set one of these up from this site at a later date. Glad I didn't...

Gox processed BTC withdrawals until Feb 2014, half a year after USD withdrawals started being delayed...

A lot of these questions have been discussed extensively here: 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:13:17
1. Have you read the Willy Report?
2. Is the data referenced in the report genuine?

How? This just shows BTC-e was used to launder the coins. He could've been the one doing it ffs.

This headline is very sensationalist...
As far as I can tell, Alexander was only arrested because BTC-e supposedly facilitated money laundering by not adhering to KYC. The 4b he laundered is just BTC-e's trading volume since 2011, no? Only a fraction of that is actually laundered money, there is just no way to prove what is and isn't, and this makes for a nice eye catcher. 
Where is the evidence BTC-e hacked Mt-Gox? All this does is prove whoever "hacked" Mt-Gox laundered a large amount of coins through BTC-e, which is understandable. This doesn't do anything to vindicate Karpeles imo. You still have the Willybot and the lies about transaction malleability. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how this suggests Mt-Gox still wasn't an inside job

This definitely is something I would like to add in the future. I think sites like  have done a good job at trying to address this quesiton.
I decided to start with BTC to fiat/stablecoin pairings simply because it seems people have taken a lot of interest in the numbers provided by the Bitwise report. Doing it this way frames the analysis as a comparison to that.

I am the author of this post, so I really appreciate the feedback.
KYC/AML wasn't something that was explicitly looked at when doing this analysis, so I think you raise a great question.
I actually just went back to check the KYC policies of all the additional exchanges included in our volume calculation. Of those 34, 32 seem to have KYC policies (although IQFinex's may be optional, I am not 100% sure).

Only Livecoin and Yobit are completely KYC/AML free. 
In total, these additional 34 exchanges have contributed a $514m in volume over the past 24 hours, with only $11m of this volume (2%) coming from non-compliant exchanges (YoBit and Livecoin).
I guess it's not too surprising that exchanges faking volume are also the ones who don't require KYC.  There is certainly a lot more volume than reported, but the question of picking through fake volume/unregulated exchanges is something I'm leaving for a later date. The purpose of this analysis was just to try and get a better baseline of exchanges that have 0 fake volume, since it seems a lot of people have taken this "only 10 exchanges have real volume" message to heart. To me, the fact that it turns out almost all the exchanges that pass this test seem to have some sort of KYC/AML policy strengthens their claim as legitimate sources of volume.
I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on applying some standard to the reported volume from the unregulated exchanges.
