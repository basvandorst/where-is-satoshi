Naomi Klein documents the destruction &amp; remolding of societies to suit neoliberal agenda's.

Bitcoin was a fascinating proof of concept but leaves much to be desired. It will not take over the world but it's grandchild may

This article tells only half the story. 
The real scandal &amp; it will scare the crap out of you is that Greece's downfall was engineered. This deliberate destruction of states to facilitate neoliberal agenda is escalating. The deliberate destruction of the Greek financial system is documented.

This is the low water mark for Bitcoin exchange credibility for me. I cant believe Bitcoin can survive these ongoing thefts of wealth. This is bullshit.

This is more than 'some' Bitcoins. It's a valid question to ask how many more times does this have to happen to destroy confidence? I see the potential of CC's but Bitcoin is looking pretty much like the dodo of the species as time goes. Ok, you reply now that you're a tycoon &amp; it's not a problem &amp; to the moon! Etc

Meanwhile Bitcoin prices continue to recover from the Hearn FUD.

Instead of paraphrasing, here's the dudes own blog post regarding the problem as he see's it. 
 
Seems to me Bitcoin has simply outgrown our current technology.  
If we all had quantum computers on our desks we could have decentralised _AND_ fast transaction processing.

Looks cybercrime pays. 
Worldwide bank losses are staggering. 
Bitcoin looks solid in comparison.

Price driven by scarcity, speculation &amp; sentiment. 
The current dip caused by a disagreement between the developers. 
Sentiment drove it down. Speculation will likely drive it up. 
It's a crap shoot. Has to be money you're prepared to lose...

Thanks. Clear info is a little thin. So this is a dummy spit by a dev over a technical disagreement. Those familiar with open source will be all too used to this. 
So TL:DR is little blocks == decentralised mining but little capacity for large volume transactions with the big block == few miners (centralised) but much higher transaction capacity. 
IMHO both are important considerations that need to be calmly discussed &amp; decisions made for best long term interests. 
Dummy spits not helpful.

This is the ugly truth :
Bitcoin was an early attempt at implementation of crypto currency. People seized on it for ideological reasons - freedom from centralised control, &amp; later for speculative reasons. As time went by &amp; word spread the speculative frenzy drew in huge amounts of wealth. 
The problem is Bitcoin has fundamental design limitations which were set in stone at the beginning &amp; which limit it's real world utility. Alternative crypto's have been developed which attempt to address these design limitations. 
Currently there are two competing proposals to try to address one of  Bitcoin's design limitations mid flight. These proposals are being debated with the ferocity of religious jihad. Big money is involved so forensic investigation of the proposer's financial/technical background is advised. Which one of these proposals is the best remains debatable - there is no clear 'best'.
The possibility that neither is the solution &amp; starting over with a new coin is overlooked often by those invested. 
Mod me down idiots.

Yes I agree with your point. I regard all crypto's as experimental technologies at this point in time. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:13:51
To the layman it seems Bitcoin is trying to retro fit fixes to design flaws whereas other crypto have been designed correctly from the start. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:32:43
I'm not here to shill or troll one crypto over another. Just an observation that as time goes on newer projects are coming along which avoid the design flaws of earlier projects. It's great that Bitcoin Devs are trying to fix design flaws as they go. As to other project recommendations that depends on what properties an end user values. There is, as yet, no perfect design it seems.
