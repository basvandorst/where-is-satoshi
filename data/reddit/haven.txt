Ohh! Do you still have a copy of the netspeed program there or know where to get it? I've been trying to find it again but the guy who made it nuked his site for some reason. :/

As a non-owning bitcoin person this is a answer I like and find more interesting.

I like Patrick in this but the show host seemed like an ass trying to get a rise out of him. Sorta expected from the media but still meh.

The truth is why would you not offer a btc option even if it doesn't pan out in the long run while it looks good right now. Having a tiny few customers pay in btc to get some cheap btc is well worth the right off even it if fails. This game is cheap in comparison.

Power companies don't produce power at max capacity all the time. They produce only what the grid is needing at the time. For example it's night for an area. Why would you want 100% of possible power produced when the connected grid only needs maybe 10% of that?
Also heard of a Brown Out? That is when there isn't enough power  in the system due to a usage spike. The power plants need to ramp up so there is a short delay as the need is filled.

Awesome! I haven't found any I like that looked that good and totally faux all the way. Love me some foxes too.

Totally off topic but everyone should go play the game "[To The Moon](

Is it possible to store coins in some version of a offline wallet for years to only have the key w/e storage system not be recognized by the bitcoin network? I ask because of all of the shit going back and forth lately between trying to figure how the network moves forward.

Far as I see there is no indication for either direction. I would like to assume its a permanent 5GB to the base account.

A note to others...
You start with 2GB basic free account and this expands you to 5GB total. Not an additional 5GB.
