Do you have a third party keyboard installed?
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:31:54
Big banks already are. Theres patents being taken out for their own cryptocurrencies and I think that's crazy
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:59:53

ALL Bitcoin transactions are technically 'online'

Happy Tuesday 
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:49:35


true that. My idea:
A service that holds "secrets". Only after pre-loaded, pre-determined addresses send a predetermined amount of bitcoin to the 'holding' address does it send out a sum of bitcoins with an attached message, holding sensitive information, maybe the whereabouts of something after someone passes away, and all those in the Will agree to it? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:37:54

It's the fact that you can send pictures easily to friends that self destruct. You can also take snapshots. Snapchat is 'worth' 3 billion, but the idea itself is what they're trying to buy. The fact . That teenagers are using it is immensely valuable too

Can I just ask, how cool would it be for TOLL BOOTHS to accept bitcoins? Just roll up to the window, open your app, and THROW YOUR PHONE 
*edit, food for thought.. what if someone did that 'social security number on a truck' thing that the one CEO did, except with a private key. And then was able to recover them, or something? IDK carry on

How many of the people who did not have their price honored complained our emailed beforehand to prevent this? I know they shouldn't have to... but I believe there are several security measures in place by Coinbase to try to stop newly created accounts from purchasing large quantities
