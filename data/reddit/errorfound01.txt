Good idea! Roll this game out to iOS and I will play it. Be sure to have a minimum startup fee for players to be sure they actually want to play with bitcoins. Like poker or something ;)

The government made the bitcoin for one stable world currency. 
I don't like the government but I do like bitcoins, so if they planning to make the bitcoin one world currency I would be happy. Looks cool to me.

I buy bitcoins at localbitcoins.com and for recieving the bitcoins i recommended you to use breadwallet for iOS or bitcoin app for android, multibit for windows, mac and linux. Use coinbase only as a bank. Please read at bitcoin.org and learn first about bitcoins before using them because when you lose your bitcoins you will never get them back. I know about it. It happend me once. 
For example you have $2000 dollars. Store the $1000 dollars on a paper wallet, $500 at coinbase and the other $500 in your mobile wallet. 
Coinbase is not like a bank because they are actuay keeping your bitcoins safe in a storage while banks are using the 'magic trick' to make more money. 
Fuck the system

And when you want to take more bitcoins from your storage dont take them from your paper wallet but from coinbase and every time you recieve or buying bitcoins put some money in coinbase. Like in real life ;)
