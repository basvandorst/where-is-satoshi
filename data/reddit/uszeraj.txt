Brazilian here. From what I understand about south american democracies lots of people that had the chance probably left the country and the result is that there are more stupid people who want free shit than productive ones. Its the Venezuelan spiral. Brazil is also not immune to it since leftists and corrupt actors have a great hold in every politic and media sphere. They can twist narratives and they can sabotage good intentions and so on. As an exemple, last month the brazilian government passed an economic freedom act that exempts small low risk business of licenses but the local prefectures are not giving a shit about it and are just ignoring the federal law.
Get out of there as soon as you can. If you have a marketable skill there are still somewehat kinda good options in South America, at least compared to shitholes like Argentina. Brazil is not perfect but at least we can have a relief time til \~2022. I'm planing my escape one way or another. Buy bitcoin, get money out of the country. Plant flags etc. Get away from South America as it will implode within the next 5 years. 
Formet Soviet or Yugoslav countries are cheap, peaceful and accessible and most of them reject socialism. Have a look into Georgia or Montenegro. If you can get an IT job in Poland or Czech republic.

I disagree with wars because it always creates oportunities to radical authoritarian agents. I favor the John Galt approach. Everyone who has potential should leave and go for places where they are wanted.

Welp... here in south america all the lefties are screaming in every corner that Chile has failed and we need more socialism... like Venezuela.

Even if he wasnt a spineless coward he couldn't go far against a predominantly peronist congress. The thing is now there are leftist media spinning the narrative of "failed ultraliberalism" in Argentina because of a so call "economically liberal" president that inaugurates Peron statues.

Heh I think posts like these are silly but this one actually hit home. Back in 2011 or 2012 I’ve watched the whole bitcoin thing dominating 4chan/g/ threads and I’ve laughed at those nerds and their magic money specially when it dropped bellow 1 USD. 
I’m not laughing now.

Kinda off topic but Brazilian here. Just want to say to our hermanos that when your country becomes South Venezuela (or South Latin North Korea) you guys are welcome here. Please bring wine.
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:30:28
Brazilian here. This is bullshit. The first sanctions were imposed on 2017 and restrictions were put in place to prevent US citizens to invest in Venezuelan economy. The Venezuelan economy started collapsing in 2009 and even during subsequent years the US has been PDVSA’s  largest customer. So if the US is to blame for doing exactly the opposite thing: to fund Maduro’s dictatorship. I’m specially surprised crooks like you have interest in Bitcoin since someone who believes in magic socialist money printer have no idea how scarcity works. Go ask blood murderer Maduro confiscating private business and controlling prices. 
And yeah your politicians are kinda right. Venezuela is the perfect example of what socialism and state controlled economy (left and right) can do to your life. Now what are you doing here again?
Did I sound rude? Sure but only because your post reeks of propaganda.
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:56:37
\&gt; Thanks for offering to answer questions. it is difficult for me to understand what is happening as an outsider living in a country who is sanctioning Venezuela.
Pretty sure this is propaganda. The first US sanctions started in 2017 with some weak shit about US citizens being forbidden to invest in Venezuelan economy. The Bolivarian economy started going down the drain by 2009 and during all this time the US has been their principal oil customers. IMO the final nail was when Kirchner and Lula lost their leadership. No friendly neighbors to save Maduro's dictatorship. Cuba also stopped receiving money from Brazil after they recalled their doctors. Maduro's only real partner nowadays is the devil himself (Vladimir Putin).
And no... Bolivia doesn't count. Evil Morales just want to save his hide. He even delivered Lula's terrorist protege Cesare Batisti to Italian authorities.

Yes it is. But Brazilian laws were just passed ordering everyone and everything to report any bitcoin transaction to our equivalent of IRS (seriously we call it "The Lion"). Specially exchanges. Although they are only taxing gains above the 30K BRL mark they still want to know if you bought a single cup of coffee with it. Not even banks need to do this. 
Of course this might prove a bit unfeasible but its a red flag saying that the Lion has finally turned its attention to us.

About that poster... Simón Bolivar tried to conquer South America and submit the region to a strong and authoritarian state with hereditary and lifelong leaderships. Not sure if irony or sarcasm is the intent but I find a bit weird to mix Bolivarian images with Fawkes and Satoshi references.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:34:13
Yeap lots of propaganda both sides I guess. People complaining about American interference but Russia is actually sending armed mercenaries to Venezuela to protect the regime. There is also a heavy Cuban presence.
I can't say a lot about the US but Brazilian previous government helped Maduro's regime through corrupt contracts using a puppet company called Odebrecht. They also funneled tax money to other Latin American dictatorships. The blood of the Venezuelan people is in their hands and also in the hands of the people who voted that party into power.
I live in Brazil. I'm always appalled when Americans and Europeans throw their CNN version of the story and disregard what actual Venezuelans say on the matter.

Contrary to Macri Bulbasdaur is actually passing economic reforms and the Congress is not cockblocking him. Just yesterday the “Economic Freedom Act” was approved by 344 against 77 votes. Making business here will be a lot easier specially for small companies.

Don't care about the price as long as it doesn't drop to the bottom. I use bitcoin as government-resistant fund. If its cheaper that means I'll buy more - and I don't buy that much anyway.

Dude, their economy has been going down their drain since mid 2009 and if there is no one else to blame. And this is happening to all the countries that followed the same communist bolivarian agenda (also known as Foro de São Paulo): Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and so on. If the US is to be blamed is the fact that they kept buying PDVSAs oil financing bloody murderer Maduro’s regime. 
I’m Brazilian and currently living in Brazil. With all due respect it is infuriating when some American or European individual express cooked up ideology invented facts while actual Venezuelans reply “no that’s not true” and then said westerners start to double down on those conspiracies.

The Road to Serfdom by [Friedrich Hayek](   
From Wikipedia:
***The Road to Serfdom*** ([German]( *Der Weg zur Knechtschaft*) is a book written between 1940 and 1943 by Austrian British [economist]( and [philosopher]( [Friedrich Hayek]( in which the author "\[warns\] of the danger of [tyranny]( that inevitably results from government control of economic [decision-making]( through [central planning]( He further argues that the abandonment of [individualism]( and [classical liberalism]( inevitably leads to a loss of [freedom]( the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a [dictator]( and the [serfdom]( of the individual. Hayek challenged the general view among British academics that [fascism]( (including [National Socialism]( was a [capitalist]( reaction against [socialism]( He argued that fascism, National Socialism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.
