Yes it locks in. I wondered the same thing. ��

Not likely, but hopefully it will endure despite it.

Can this google quantum system crack bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:59:28
I don’t know, but my understanding is that encryption can be cracked with enough time and if this quantum computer can do calculations that would take conventional computers 10 thousand years could it hack the blockchain?

What app did you buy it with?

In my opinion he’s paranoid and an amateur. If he knowingly sold bitcoin to someone who admits to laundering money he is complicit in the crime. I’d guess the statement of wanting to be anonymous got him worried and he overreacted.

Not sure, but this is a great debate. Has me thinking no to your question

That makes sense, thanks. Knowing that then I think the answer is when it is considered legal tender.  In the US that is many years. In my opinion.

Isn’t the issue buying bitcoin on credit cards? I don’t know if any bank denies a purchase from a deposit account.

1 BTC is 100million satoshi, but with global adoption I think it could be too little for small things when for example a satoshi is worth say $100 and one needs to purchase something small. imo.
