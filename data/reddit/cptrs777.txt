Need that weekend spending monies
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:25:47
That's honestly not even my point, although I do agree.  I have a credit card, linked to my money, that pays me to use it.  What is the benefit of using bitcoin (for everyday transactions)?  The more I use it the more I lose money for using it.  I again understand its benefits in other areas, but I pay my cc off daily/as used and make thousands of free dollars a year for using it without any interest, fees, or similar.  
Edit: my credit card takes seconds to use vs minutes as well

Erik is ~~the~~ shit!  ... fixed

Until bitcoin pays me a % cashback, why would I use something that has fees to even use for everyday events?  Literally the more you use it the more it costs you.  I get the secrecy and use of crypto versus other slow and expensive banking options for larger international type transactions, but everyday use and normal daily transactions?  We are not there yet.

I am with this guy.  I also don't understand why it is so immediate.  Are we really supposed to believe ALL of these different un-pumped ALTs are bleeding exactly or faster than BTC's rise every single day?  It just seems extremely odd.

I just mean harddrive as the current blockchain is in the 200gbs or something if I recall (if you want a digital wallet).  Same with ethereum in the 120s or so.  So if he wanted digital wallets for each off the original source it'd be hundreds of gigs.  There are other means out there, but just a quick heads up.
@_date: 2018-07-29 11:57:40
Just have him buy some with fiat off of Coinbase and have it stay there.  If he really wants a wallet, he'll need a pretty hefty HD or similar to catchup on the bigger blockchains.
