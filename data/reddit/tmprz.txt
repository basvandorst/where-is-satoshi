hey, so I've already had a "pre interview meeting" which was held on the 18th of this month. a good few days before most of this hit the media... and when I say they i mean the general manager.
During this meeting the "GM" told me she was in Japan during as the initial crisis broke with Mark himself. She said it was to get further info on the subsidiaries company and payment structure. However, I don't really believe this anymore.
during our discussion she mentioned that mark had told her the issues were due to a hack that they had known about since 2011 whereby bitcoins on the exchange could be taken and the transaction duplicated to show the value still in the wallet.
She mentioned that mark had to come out to the media and say something in the end but most of it was just bad media in general.
I'll try put together a list of Q's to ask them and see what the outcome is. I'll post everything I hear back on here.

I should also mention, it's actually for a job interview. I'm currently working as an analyst for a payments processor in europe. I know mt gox has gone tits up, however the interview is still going ahead. So while locked in the room with these 2, I would like to ask some questions.

My terminology may be incorrect but the statement is not.
The source error reported by Gox allowed hackers to essentially take peoples bitcoins from their trading accounts and replace it with the same value, but less the bitcoin.
The developers eventually spotted this but the damage was done. Now Gox cannot fulfil its withdraws and has put a hold on trading.
From what I understand the only option here is to file for bankruptcy. 
end.
