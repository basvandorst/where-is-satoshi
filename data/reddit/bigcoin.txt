you can take a look at what we are doing at  which is using bitcoin to revolutionize how credit is distributed around the world using peer to peer lending. It is only possible thanks to bitcoin. 
Many people in 3rd world countries have very hard access to credit or have to pay exorbitant fees. With bitcoin we can help those people and still allow investors to generate outstanding returns, since we are moving money from where interest is super low to where interest is super high. And this is all thanks to bitcoin!

this is a great point - I am in the same boat. can someone clarify this? as far as I know if you own a car in a foreign country that does not need to be disclosed anywhere on your tax form... and since bitcoins are property, shouldn't this be treated the same way like a car?

It would be nice to know how much you pay before having to sign up...!

and I think bitcoinpulse is the most valuable one :)

Well look at stripe then. Stripe is younger than bitcoin, and bitcoin is growing much faster and also has many more projects in absolute terms.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:14:14
please note the number of absolute projects is already much higher too.
On top we are also comparing it to Stripe, which is younger than bitcoin!

I agree with most of your objections.


We did mention that we are limited to open source projects, which is a rather serious limitation. There certainly are tens of thousands if not hundred of thousands of companies using paypal or stripe, and we wouldn't find these projects on GitHub. However, when people try to improve a platform/service/technology, many of them chose to do so in an open source way. So maybe we can say
"Developers right now are more excited to building open source improvments/projects with bitcoin than with Stripe or Paypal", which is still a significant data point IMHO.


Whether they have a GitHub account or not actually doesn't matter in our analysis. It was merely to note that GitHub has a very broad reach with developers, and infering from such that data on GitHub is relatively credible. I would argue that for open source contributions GitHub is the preferred destination for developers.


Absolutely. We are (maybe incorrectly) assuming that the technologies used in open source contributions are in a positive correlation with what is being used in the sum of open and closed source projects.

OP here: True that the from a consumer wallet perspective PayPal is saturated. We also said that the comparison is a bit apples to oranges, since bitcoin is a much wider platform (wallet, currency, payment processing, value store, API for cash etc) than paypal (mostly payment processing and wallet) is.
I think two things are still interesting to observe:
- The absolute numbers of projects referencing is already much higher than Paypal for a much, much smaller audience of consumers that can be served.
- This also means that devs who build for bitcoin now are really betting on bitcoin getting a lot bigger than it is now, otherwise it would probably make more sense to build things on top of existing payment processing platforms

is there any place to see how many merchants of shopify are accepting bitcoin?

if you look at the top right, you can switch between 'cumulative' and 'delta', which does exactly what you just described.
