With a much, much lower hashrate, and a much less secure network.

Same thing here.
Only a couple times I did manage to access the site for a minute or so, then it got down again.

BTW, I do understand that you guys are at holywar (the whole core vs cash thing, hence the downvotes I guess?), but lol, do you really deny that bitcoin cash would be a better solution for Venezuelans? I mean, according to what I've read, the guys pay for food with Bitcoin, and their minimal wage is equivalent to 5.55 USD. Do you think paying a fee that is almost equal to a minimal monthly wage (even if it was half of it, or 1/4th of it) for a single transaction is OK?

He meant both. Why can't you just accept that Bitcoin was supposed to be BOTH the trustless instrument &amp; store of value AND a payment system? The latter makes it usable, makes it complete. Without being liquid and having the perks of payment system, the whole trustless decentralization thing is not useful (if not meaningless, if you eventually won't be able to freely convert your Bitcoin holdings to any other property / product / store of value whenever you wish).
Why there is an opinion now that you have to sacrifice one aspect of Bitcoin (liquidity / payment system / "decentralized electric cash") in favor of another ("bearer instrument that no government could take from you")? It was supposed to be both, one is not that much useful without the other. Why limit yourself to only the latter, can anybody explain me?

Do you really maintain a full Bitcoin node as of now? If yes, how many GB is that?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:06:30
I believe miner incentives will always keep them mining. I'm no expert but what little hashrate it has now is more than enough for relatively fast transactions. If it goes too low, others will tune in as EDA will likely make mining profitable again.

Thanks for the details.
So from what I understand, in that worst 12-hour period, it'd take 2 hours for a single block on average. Doesn't look so terrible, given the low fees. Bitcoin transactions usually take from 30 minutes to 1 hour, after all.
And it's not very likely that such a period will last for long (as in such a scenario the miners will temporarily leave, and unless the 'Other' adds more hashpower, the overall hashpower will eventually drop below the threshold for EDA to kick in). 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:58:01
Surely they won't. Still it's a move in a wrong direction, which would likely limit (even if slightly) exposure to BTC for the general crowd.

Hey, it's rebounding. :)

Dude, a full Bitcoin node is already around 160 GB. 
If you want to maintain a node and have a vote and stuff, and if you already do that with 160 GB sized blockchain, shouldn't it be not that much of an issue to acquire a 2TB drive? 
(costs 100$ where I am; and 150$ for a 4TB drive)
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:15:43
I think it's because the price fell, while the percentage of miners is still quite high. Once it drops below a certain threshold (and it will if the price drops comapred to BTC even more), EDA will likely kick in.
As of now, the block confirmations are fast nevertheless, I suppose. It's less profitable than BTC (as BTC skyrocketed and BCH prices fell), yes, but the hashrate here is still pretty high. And if gets low enough, it will balance out again IMO.

Does that mean that after everyone switches to SegWit, each block will have 4 times as many transactions? Since the signatures are now in the other 3 MB, you know.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:47:06
Cool. Props to you. But why do you think it's that prohibitive to have it 8 times as large? It'd require an acquisition of a 2TB drive (or 4TB for a longer term), yes, but is it really that costly?
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:48:12
I've read the original news in Russian, and guess what, this is BAD news.
These changes are there only to regulate bitcoin, and prohibit normal users from trading it (unless they use certified professionals at the stock exchange, which would be very costly). Also, now, to be considered a professional investor (otherwise you won't have access to the exchange, officially), they'd have to have large sums of money, so not everyone will even be able to do so.

What about Bitcoin Cash? It seems to be able to solve your problems: 
* most people who know about Bitcoin also know about Bitcoin Cash (and it sounds as almost the same brand, so to speak)
* most likely they (and you) will also have it if they had it pre August 1st. Quite easy to use (and claim) too
* extremely low fees, 1500 times as low as Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:48:04
Wait, you think they have something around 10-20 billion USD for that?
