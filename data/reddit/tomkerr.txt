Author here. Does it still count as a throwaway if you use your real name?
I agree the likelihood of Augur becoming a major player in online gambling is remote. But it's not impossible. And there's a solid precedent for an outsider with an innovative betting platform carving out a big section of the market.
Betfair is just 15 years old and its peer-to-peer marketplace revolutionised online gambling in my corner of Europe. Thanks to better odds and a unique betting proposition (the ability to place lay bets), they took a significant portion of a well-established market in a way that seemed completely impossible only a few years earlier. As they demonstrated, billion dollar gaming companies are not immune to a competitor offering a superior service. 
Augur has two advantages that make me think it is at least possible it could be similarly successful. The first is its low takeout, which as I mention in the article is more relevant in places such as America than in Britain where we have extremely competitive sports betting. But still, with a 1 per cent takeout Augur will offer better odds than even a peer-to-peer exchange like Betfair, which takes a 5 per cent cut (and much more from major players). 
The second advantage it that is can ignore local regulatory regimes, which again is vastly more meaningful in places where online gambling is restricted or illegal. If that drives liquidity it will inevitably draw in customers even from more liberal jurisdictions.
Of course, none of that really matters unless cryptocurrencies become mainstream. Making predictions about whether that will happen is not really within my competence, but I think it would be wrong to assume it definitely will not happen.
