non-resident aliens get taxed differently on capital gains. The reason I'm asking this is because they don't get taxed on foreign gains. So what happens if they sell their BTC on an international exchange? That's foreign income they don't pay tax on. Correct? This is tricky I wish someone could offer some advice.

Ok question. US Citizen purchases 1 BTC for 5k. Sells 1 BTC (handing over wallet) to a non-resident alien. 1 BTC is now worth 20k.  Non-resident alien transfers 1 BTC to a foreign exchange and sells Bitcoin for a profit of 15k. Who pays taxes on what?

No, it's not a stock. You need to register with an exchange like coinbase or gdax. Deposit money, then buy bitcoins. Look into a hardware wallet to store your bitcoins instead of having the exchange manage them for you.

So, back to the original example with Bitcoin, would the non-resident alien have to pay taxes if they sell on a foreign exchange?

Why would anyone pay using bitcoins when they have to pay capital gains tax on it?

Let's say Bitcoin gains mass adoption. My fear is that thieves will hold people at gunpoint in the street forcing them to empty their bank accounts. Traditional banks protect against this because the transactions can be cancelled after they're made. What's the solution for Bitcoin?

If the Bitcoin is put on a foreign exchange, sold to a foreigner, is this still considered: "real property located in the United States"? If the BTC is put in a foreign exchange, is it still located in the US?
Very tricky matter.
Let's consider a non-resident alien who has a valuable antique painting. If they ship it to Europe and sell it there, do they pay taxes on those gains?

Thanks. I feel like you've just given me free CPA training haha.

Bought and sold for 5k for simplicity's sake and to focus on the non-resident alien. Can you provide a source about the non-resident alien not having to pay tax on this? Because I know they have to pay capital gains on certain things.
