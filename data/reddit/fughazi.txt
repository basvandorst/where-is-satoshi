Out of all the car companies for him to try to pull that card on, Tesla is by far the worst one.

I don't know where you came up with the idea that you could have lost more on the stock market. The worst year in the *history* of the stock market yielded -52.67%. I'm not saying one is better than the other, but let's not kid ourselves here.

Of course there is the opportunity for them to do that, just like every other automotive company in existence. The only problem is that GM's decreasing market share makes it look like they're doing a pretty bad job of that. Meanwhile, Tesla has been around for under a decade and is about so surpass their market cap.
