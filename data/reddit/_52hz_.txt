He there, curious if you could touch on the topic over on the forums here -           
It's been almost a month without a reply on the forum, and I still have not received any answer to my email inquiry.

That makes no sense. Drug dealers and gay people are the same?

Dooing what you want with your body does not make anything you put into it harmless.
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:30:15


See, you can't just say that. Sure, weed dealers maybe, but what say you about crack, cocaine, meth dealers? Also harmless?            
And what about the fact it was not just drugs that was sold. Child porn, weapons, and other absolutely illegal items and services.       
You cannot justify this by saying "well gays are not hurting anyone, therefore drug dealers/users are not" - the statement makes no sense.          
You are grouping hundreds of drugs and several roles into a single group for comparison, and conveniently leaving out the items and services that had nothing to do with drugs.            
It was a blackmarket, all users and operators were doing so illegally and they knew that, and they are criminals.            
Even if they were friendly people - you in no situation could say that murder was the best and justifiable option. How about pay up?          
Ross seems to have plenty of coins, why not just pay/bribe them?         
What about paying for a DOX? Mutual distrust.             
Several options other than murder, and it's disguising so many people are arguing that it was even partially justified. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:30:11
Well, you are taking up for criminals and trying to justify murder, I'd say your both wrong.

Did you read the post? This was posted by *him*, not me. I willingly rented along with him, I knew the risk.             


Because that is illegal since they had a legal right to the property due to (fucked up) squatters laws.          


I'm a very peaceful person - I always apologies and let people go first, I'm courteous, I'm somewhat over-generous, and have a 9mm Glock 26 on me at all times in case the other attributes do not suffice.           


Can't. Their property was protected by the same squatter laws that allowed them entry on the property. Police actually threatened to arrest me when I told them I was getting rid of it.              


Camera system reports 24/7 directly to a monitoring company. Since that would be theft, they could easily ask for the video and see us removing their property. Having a convenient blank spot when their stuff was "taken" would be suspicious enough to focus the blame on me.             


Probably, but I'm not risking criminal charges over this and I doubt my roommate is either.       


Like the post stated, they legally have a right to the property. This is akin to a landlord simply throwing out a tenants property without any eviction process.              


No call for that whatsoever, especially since you obviously barely read the post seeing as all the questions/statements you made were all explained in full.

Well, in the end a 30 day notice was "found" by the management - not sure if they did me a solid or just lost it, but that's on them in court.           
Since law works retroactively sometimes, they're being brought up on not 1 but 3 felony charges. Pretty sure they're going to see at least 10 years of prison time each.

Garage? No. House. And it's worse that just that.           
Copied from here - 
This is an odd situation. I singed onto a 1 year lease October 24th 2013 into a house with 3 other guys (however they brought a 4th along that never was on the lease, but is the source of the problems).            
During the first 6 month period I had ~$4,000 of material items, medicine, equipment, &amp; plain cash stolen. Some of it they admitted to while drunk, some of it I found while moving their old stuff, and the rest is simply assumptions (however odd that, as they suggested, people broke in but only stole my stuff).           
Anyways, that's in the past.       
I moved out with a long time friend into apartments for 6 months, and  2 months before the end of the main house lease I asked the landlords of the house if i could sign back on - just me and my friend. They were more than happy to let me, as I had also been paying ~60% of their rent, 100% of bills for the entire duration of the lease (even when I didn't live there) so they knew I was a good tenant.       
They left the house somewhat damaged from their cannabis growing resulting is (currently) $460 in repairs I've had to pay.         
I've also been told by my landlords that I need to get rid of the growing equipment (as they grew cannabis against the rules of the landlords) but told by the police I'd be charged with theft if I moved it on the curb, sold it, basically did anything but give it to them personally.        
I have offered at least a dozen times to help move, they refuse. I do not have their real phone numbers, the ones that do actually dial don't have a voicemail set up and they never answer. SMS is never answered.         
They will not give me their new address (I'd be willing to move everything over for them).            
They left:
 * 1.5 Rooms of grow equipment
 * 3 Rooms Furniture/Junk
 * 1 Room was a matress/badframe, couch, dresser, and wardrobe.
 * 1 room was an entire room - personal belongings, bed, sheets, cloths - everything that one of the guys on the lease owned. even personal tax info and family photos (which he refused to take when handed personally)
 * 1 room looked to be all broken furniture and glass alcohol bottles arranged, we threw away the bottles but all the broken furniture and old cloths are still here.         
 * 150+ glass bottles. w\We stopped counting at around 155. 
 * 10+ Contractors Bags of old bills/mail (all to me, we saved their stuff), trash, old food, wrappers, cannabis clippings, &amp; cans.        
 * Ripped Up Carpet, total of around 3 meters of torn areas
 * Vomit/Urine stians on living room carpet
 * Ripped screen door blinds down (the blinds, not the fixture)
 * Removed kitchen sink trap/drain. Nearly ruined the floor, I caught it first. 
 * Filled kitchen sink with dirt/soil
 * Left 20-30 pounds of dirt/topsoil in the garage. 10+ on the floor. 
 * Entire garage was filled with trash. Literally 80% of the space was trash bags from lack of trash service (I stopped paying that). You could not walk from one end to the other.       
 * Various parts of the house, trash, &amp; dead animal parts (looks to be 1-2 dead deer) in the back yard.\
**October 31st**: After a nice halloween and the neighborhood was settling down, I went to talk with the next door neighbors. When I told them the other guys moved out, they let me know that the day I had changed the locks (October 26th) they had waited parked at the corner for over an hour, and broke into the front window when I left.         
I was told by police it was a grey area since I wasn't on the new lease until November 1st.            
Put all of their stuff in the garage (which they have all the openers to) and the back yard (which they have full access to) under a bluetarp on the deck.       
We've tried to give their personal info (axes, family photos) back but they refuse telling us (literally) "we don't care".           
They know that their stuff is located in the garage and out back. We were clear when we said none of their items are inside the house.                 
Installed an 8 camera security system on November 1st.          
**November 5th**: Today me and my roommate are doing errands, one of the others call and ask "You guys are not at home are you?". We find this odd and immediately pull up the cameras. Sure enough it's just in time to see one of them breaking the front window (again) and entering into the house. The one that broke in was never at any point on the lease.          
He looks around the place, in the garage, but never on the back deck. He instead looks at **our** stuff, and several times stands for 10 - 15 seconds as if debating on if to do something.             
When he left, before getting back in the car he stopped and went through our trash.               
He did not take anything as we see on the cameras, but he has broken the locks twice now.           
We called the police and got 2 units out, but they told us since their stuff was  on the property they could legally enter in any form they wanted as long as they did not commit theft of our items. They did not even want to see the video camera footage, and suggested we take out a Public Storage unit in their name and put their stuff their. We tried that but it seems difficult without having one of them there, and I've already paid over $8,000 in rent and fees for these guys so I really am not looking to pay any more.         
So, what can I do?           
they are breaking my property to get in, they are not taking their stuff but looking around the entire house, and the refuse to work with us to remove their items from our property.

EDIT: Forgot to mention they left me with $1,205 to pay on the last month rent since they knew I'd rather pay it than be evicted. And yes, I'm still taking care of their stuff and offering to move it myself.
EDIT: Broke in a third time (or attempted to) the next morning at 5:55AM, was violently kicking my dog that was barking at him. Going though our items the day of the last break in we noticed our keys are gone (mail key, PO box key, house keys, apartment keys, car keys, safe keys). Looking through security footage they have went through my vehicle as well.

**Story:** I've been slowly investing in bitcoins for the last 3 years. While it's not gone as well as others I know, I've still managed to make some decent profit.       
However, I've never really bought anything with them other than the occasional random item from the bitcoin trade wiki. Even these are rarely over $30 USD of coins.           
Fast forwards to 2 days ago. My main vehicle was running rough and near death, so I figured it was time for a trade in.               
I have a friend that I've know going on 3 years now that runs a small auto dealership a hour away, so after failing to find a suitable replacement on craigslist I thought I'd ask him.          
Chatted for an hour and bitcoins came up ,and he jokingly said he'd cut me a deal on the pathfinder (one of the two we were talking about) for an even $3000, I accepted. He thought I was joking but we talked and he said it would be acceptable. After tax and fees it totaled just under $3500.             
Technically he bought my coins on the spot and applied the cash to the vehicle, he didn't have an option for paying/financing directly with bitcoins but I still think it counts.         
Overall it was a great choice i think, although I'm going to have to go see if the Nissan was as good as I think it is.           
**Addendum:** The garage is still full of the remains of squatters items (most items along the left wall) so please forgive the messy area. The right side is much more organized although now that we have 2 cars, that means we can't have a workshop in the garage.

To be honest I've used Wells Fargo explicitly for the reason that when I first inquired about bitcoins, it was not the situation with BoA or credit unions - the banker knew what bitcoins were and welcomed them.                 
They have also had reasonable regulations and rules that they can control (some are federally mandated) since I've been a member.      
That's just one persons experience through 2 states over a 5 year period though, so a grain of salt compared to the whole.

While I saw the FAQ, I was referred here to "ask reddit" about bitcoins.       
Common sense dictated I look around first, and found the FAQ, but many send people to this reddit for answers by just telling them to ask.
