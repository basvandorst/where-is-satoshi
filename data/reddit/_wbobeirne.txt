You can see in the last screenshot that the Lightning payment had a sub-penny fee:

Yep, that's exactly how Joule works today!

This is unfortunately a hard requirement of the Lightning network at the moment, since you can't just sign transactions offline and broadcast using someone else's node. 
Lightning requires hot private keys since you're signing data as a part of routing, and you need to (more or less) always be online right now, so there's no trustless way to leverage someone else's node.
Im hoping to see some custodial Lightning stuff come around that I can integrate with. I think it's reasonable for people to trade privacy and security for convenience when it's just a few hundred bucks on Lightning.

Thanks, that word is my nemisis. Seriously, I always chicken out of doubling at least one of the 3 letters that you need to.

Browser extensions are pretty locked down for computer access (as they should be) and running any kind of node, Neutrino or otherwise, requires a lot more access than an extension offers.
However, I'm considering the idea of a companion desktop app for Joule that does exactly that, but that would be a good bit further down the roadmap since there are plenty of other people working on desktop node software.
EDIT: As an aside, you can run Joule using a Neutrino-synced node, so you don't need a full node to run Joule if you use some other Neutrino node software.

The other half to Joule is WebLN, a standard for doing exactly that:  I'm going to work with lapp developers to try to integrate this to have a few working examples soon.
EDIT: I also see other people talking about WC3 standard, which I'll definitely look into supporting as soon as it's solidified. But for now, WebLN could work today.

I think one of the big value-adds is finding the pairings of client options + server options. So as an app, I can say that I accept Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Lightning payments. The user's client then gives the user a choice of the ones both the server will accept, and that the client can handle. So from both a code and UX perspective, it's the same for any of them. This is great for both users and developers alike.

I caught this post over on but just wanted to pop in here. I'm the author of this extension, and would be happy to answer any questions if anyone has any! It should be up in the extension stores shortly, just awaiting approval. But in the mean time, if you hit any snags while trying to install or run it, please drop an issue in the Github issue queue:

Both approaches (Auto-pay &amp; 402) are on my radar:
* Auto-pay 
* 402 response code 
Feel free to chime in there if you have any extra thoughts!
