I would consider myself pretty computer savvy. I would never open a jpg.exe and I do have virus protection running. I haven't run malware bytes in a bit so I'll see if that turns up anything obvious. 
I honestly cannot think of what may have possibly compromised my system. I'm thinking about doing a clean reinstall of windows just in case.

I'm at work now. Once I get home I'll post a syslog.

Ah, ok thanks.

Wow, glad to know I'm not the only one at least. I too did not encrypt my wallet as I didn't have much in there and I'm bad at procrastinating.

I've got a legit version of Windows but I'm considering using Tails on a USB stick for bitcoin stuff in the future now.

Thanks for posting this. I'm curious to see what comes out. I keep my computer as secure as I know how so this was a bit of a shock. I'm just very glad I didn't keep much in that wallet. 
My main concern is over what, if anything else, could be compromised on my system.
I should note, not that it probably matters, but my computer was off when these transactions occurred so the wallet key was probably acquired earlier than last night. The transactions were between midnight and 1am EST.

I'm using version 0.8.5. Does that version auto encrypt? I did not do a manual encryption from within the client myself.

I definitely plan on checking out Armory asap. Luckily most of my BTC is tied up with asicminer shares so I'm good for the most part. 
I would still love to know how my system was compromised in general though so I can avoid it in the future.

Is this real? I would freak out if someone tipped me a whole BTC.

Nice work man! How have your sales been on Black Friday today?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:54:45
Sadly, no. A product of my overwhelming laziness.

My guess, somewhere between $800-$850.

I lurked the bitcointalk forum but never actually signed up.

I'm running Malware Bytes right now but so far nothing has turned up. My antivirus has not found anything either.
