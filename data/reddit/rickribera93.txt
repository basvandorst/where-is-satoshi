Breaking news is the catalyst for price movement, technical analysis is the severity of that price movement.

This is a great marketing opportunity for other exchanges, some one should step up and start fostering the move of Gox customer's to their own exchange.

For those who don't understand the MACD techincal indicator. When a "cross over" occurs, this usually means a large price increase is imminent. As you can see... inside the yellow circle ,that I created with a potato program, is where the crossover is shyly starting to make its way up.

Also, don't hate me because I quoted Bitstamp.

I invite you to write a paper as to why your parameters are more well suited than the defaults

Weighing the risk of a potential profit or a loss. In circumstances where you are trying to maximize profits or minimize losses.

It is a one day chart, also, in terms of mathematics. Using a relative strength indicator for bitcoin has little weight because bitcoin is volatile. In the case of bitcoin, the indicator is skewed and it has more practical implications in equity markets.

Who's to say they aren't?

Simply put, some one could spend the same Bitcoin twice. So if i had 1 bitcoin, I could transfer the same bitcoin to you, and also to some one else. Kind of like a bank overdraft, except I could get away with out paying back the negative balance and fees. Correct me if I'm wrong plz.

Sounds to me like this a certificate of deposit that pays no interest...

They should be 12,26,9. Those current setting do not gauge the price trends very well. You should always be using the traditional settings unless you're cross referencing other chart technical in an algorithmic formula that weighs the MACD lower than normal.

My common sense is telling me that you're trolling right now but I'll humor you for a few more minutes.
If your professor found an "optimum setting" for a MACD historgram, then he wouldn't be working as a professor.
Also, in the event that you are telling the truth, the only commodities that would apply to are ones that have extremely low volatility, lower than gold.
And considering he conducted a study for the past 40 years, I'm guessing he started this little project when he was in his mid 20's?
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:43:01
Well I'm definitely not going to do that, but price peaks and troughs are more easily defined with the default settings.

Anyone who used GOX should file their taxes immediately, this will prevent the possibility of someone stealing your tax return.

the last time a MACD Historgram crossover occurred was late 2014, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, where the red bars switched over to green bars. A large price increase shortly followed

Let me stop you right there.... Do you know how much volume is accounted for by trading bots? Did you know those trading bots execute their decisions based on technical analysis? If you were to sit down for an hour and watch the time and sales sheet data of a bitcoin exchange, you would truly understand the extent of which trading bots are doing on the exchanges and you might have a little bit more respect for technical analysis.

The parameters are skewed from default settings, what are their current settings?

Coinbase is horrible, I just recently bought $100 worth of bitcoin at exchange rate of $735/1 BTC and those bastards received my money and canceled my order the day of the delivery and said I was "high risk", even though I'm fully verified. Coincidentally, my order was also canceled when bitcoin was trading at $875/1BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:05:22
You obviously didn't read everything, I clearly stated "technical analysis does not predict the future, it helps weigh the risk."
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:50:04
I've seen one case where coinbase replaced a man's stolen bitcoins upwards of about $9000. I recommend you keep them on coinbase so long as you don't have the API feature turned on.

Alright wise ass, since I'm so so full of shit. Why don't you wright a complaint email to investopedia.com and tell them why their entire library of technical analysis knowledge is bullshit.
