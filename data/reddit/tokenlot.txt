Any hardware wallet is ok for the split because you control the private keys.
If there is a fork, youll be able to have coins on both forks by importing the private keys to your wallet addresses.

Dont worry. It didnt disappear, it came back to you as change. It's in another address that you have in your Electrum wallet. 
Go to your addresses on Electrum and click on the Change folder. You'll see it there.
When sending BTC transactions, a full input has to be spent, and the change will come back to you. You can google 'change back bitcoin' for some more info on it.

Any hardware or software wallet where you control the private key. If you can export the pkey, you'll be fine.

Wow this guy actually transcribed the whole address from an image, lol. Dedication.

What would be the convenience? 
The whole point of BTC is to get rid of banks and the middle man.

I'm cool with that as long as in a few years we have another 10x bull run... 
But remember, the last crash was due to the hack of MtGox and loss of 800,000 Bitcoin

Best advice is to not invest more than you can afford to loose.
Are you in Bitcoin for a quick trade or long term? If this is long term, ride it out.

You think AlphaBay is the first DarkNet to go down? 
This isn't 2012 anymore. DarkNet transactions are a very very small part of Bitcoin transactions now a days.

If your friends are going to kill you, then sell the BTC and return their money.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:21:13
You're going to pay a hefty transaction fee in BTC for that amount. 
You should see if you can pay them in an altcoin.

Private keys are the passwords required to send Bitcoin out of an address. You don't have to memorize the password yourself. That is the point of wallet software. It keeps track of all your addresses and private key combos.

Oh whewwww. 
Thought it was because of me

I think it's a good idea. Keep it until you graduate college, and maybe you'll be able to fund a pretty sweet vacation as a graduation present for yourself!

I don't think there is a limit to the number of outputs, but rather the file size. I am not 100% sure though

What 'money' would they take? 
If they took our Bitcoins then the Bitcoin they stole would be worthless. They wouldn't be able to sell our stolen bitcoin because it wont be worth anything.

Althought, CoPay is a nice wallet, I'd recommend you get a new wallet before August 1st.
The biggest limitation with CoPay is you cannot see or export your private keys.

What Bitcoin class, might I ask?
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:35:22
Luckily the Bitcoin code is open-source and verifiable that nobody can just run away with everyone's Bitcoin.
Furthermore, think about it- if somebody 'hacked' the BTC network and stole everybody's coins, those coins would be worthless and have no more value. Nobody would be willing to pay a penny for BTC because then that person would just re-steal it from you.
What's the worth of a Bitcoin? However much someone is willing to pay for it.
