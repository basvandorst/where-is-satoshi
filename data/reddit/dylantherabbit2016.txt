I discovered BTC at age 7 in 2011 (whole other story), and I remember talking about it in 2013.. back then we were sympathizing with those who bought at $1100. Times change

I only have $100 missing... *shrug*

@_date: 2018-08-06 13:33:44
I'd go back to 1980, buy $100 in Apple, cash out at $40,000 today, then use that $40,000 to buy a couple million BTC in 2009, then fast forward to 2383, buy me a million luxury warpships at 0.4 BTC each, then come back to 2018 and take over the world

Considering the fact that BTC likes trading counter to the market, I'd assume it'd help boost our slowly-growing chance of reaching six figures.
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:58:43
Actually it's more like this:
* 2 seconds to stop walking
* 3 seconds to bend over
* 5 seconds to struggle to pick it up
* 3 seconds to get up
* 2 seconds to accelerate again
=15 seconds

@_date: 2019-06-17 14:25:49
Both those countries have low immigration, low population, and LOTS of natural resources. They can afford socialism, unlike most countries. Venezuela could have aswell (potentially) if they didn't fuck it up completely.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:06:08


That's only around 1/2 of what it is here in the US.
Edit: I thought considering the fact that many other things are 10x cheaper that it would actually run even *lower*, but that's still low and insanely high depending on how you look at it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:53:07
Mostly ETH here.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:14:02

@_date: 2019-06-12 23:45:41
Foreshadowing. After the 2020 block halving, your portfolio will look like 0:47 in that video.
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:59:53
You'd even make $500 off that deal!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:26:30
It can't sustain forever. I've watched this happen before with the $1100 bubble. I might've dropped out too early (BTC at $10,000 probably WILL happen), but that's my prediction.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:19:15
I took half of my BTC and put it in ETH at ~$5500. Waiting for the next crash so people say 'RIP BITCOIN RIP BITCOIN' and then I'll slide in there and convert it again. Didn't get good returns on my ETH though like I was expecting :(
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:49:20
I think we're only 10-20 years off from the point where, when people say something like '50 bitcoin' they mean 50 satoshis. Or '2 bitcoin', etc.. 
Reddit: "TIL that in 2019 one BTC was only worth a fraction of a penny."
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:09:46
I so want to save up like $1000 so I can own a full bitcoin after the bust
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:15:06
Optimistic view:
-BTC crashes
-Falls to around $1000
-ETH takes a spike following people seeking alternatives
-after the spike I convert it to BTC
-MONEY MONEY MONEY MOOONEEEEYYY
Pessimistic view:
-BTC crashes
-falls to $3000
-ETH loses some
-I convert it to BTC
-some profit (especially with the next bubble)

@_date: 2017-10-23 11:13:04
From what I've seen, I think bitcoin will burst around $10k. Just my prediction though.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:17:46
Yeah but the value there will stay around the same. If it grows to $200 trillion, then a satoshi may be $0.10, but it still acts the same or similar in value as if it would've still been $0.05.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:25:29
The world's money supply is around $100 trillion, so a satoshi would be $0.05. Still not bad
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:18:22
Few years ago (2014ish after the crash)

Yeah. Tencent's funds account to a total pool of $20 trillion. Put that $20 trillion into BTC and under Tom Draper's rule BTC will be at $25,000,000. This would shake up the economy like a magnitude 7 earthquake but even then global economy wouldn't completely collapse. We'd have to be talking in dollars per satoshi for something like that.
