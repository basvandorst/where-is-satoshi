Ha wasn't expecting to get a reply 6 months later. 
Its not paypal that is catching you. Its that 9 times out of 10 the person sending you money via paypal is trying to scam you. This happens in one of two ways...
1) They are using someone else's paypal account. When the original owner finds out they will just call paypal and freak out. At that point paypal will hold your account and try to get that money back.
2) They are using their own account but call paypal and claim they didnt authorize that transaction.
Either way they end up with the bitcoins for free. I have even had chargebacks happen weeks later from people with high feedback scores.

Please stop talking.

Wow havent seen that. Every time I am on they at least have a little bit.

Unless you dont have a bank account or dont want to give a company your personal info, I think your best bet is coinbase.

For vendors there is localbitcoins. It has a lot of flaws though. A scammer or bad user can simply create a new account within minutes.

Yes. A lot actually.

Seems like a decent demand but is there really a demand for this? Would people be willing to buy them and wait for them to be delivered?

At the end of the day, did anyone expect any different outcome? To be pissed that you lost money because you were "trading" on a platform that wasn't regulated is just stupid.

It depends on how much you want to buy. 
If it is just a hundred dollars or two you can buy with a credit card on btcquick.com
If not then check out localbitcoins.com

I get that. I mean arent they operating as an illegal business though? 
And even if they were running semi legally, wouldnt the chargeback rate quickly eat up the 5-7% profit margin they have?
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:19:59
Yeah Im saying that all of them are flawed so should be avoided in the first place without assuming the massive risk of operating an illegal business.

Verifications for me usually take under an hour. Depends on how many confirmations you are waiting on though. 
4 hours is getting a bit long though.

I cant speak on the issue exactly, but I will say that my account has been timing out every time I use it today.
I always get quick responses from Coinbase. Try tweeting them.

I sell on localbitcoins. Message me on here if you ever need a trade at a discounted rate. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:57:17
Nope. Thats the problem with them not being regulated. Its not like you have and official ownership that is bound by anyone other than the company you invested in. 
They dont have to honor your agreement because there is no one to even half way "regulate" them now. 
I know it sucks that sites like this close, but it is for a good reason. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 15:25:16
Whatever you do, don't sell via paypal on localbitcoins. No matter how high of a premium you can get, it will be a bad idea. 
I learned the hard way.
