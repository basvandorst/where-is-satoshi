Everything’s in $10000 increment except the drop? That’s some deceptive shit right there.

Think of this, how can a coin created out of thin air (some anonymous white paper) be worth $17k?

Even if I believe in the same ideology, there are quite a few other cryptos out there doing what bitcoin does in a decentralized, immutable and private way only faster and cheaper. While bitcoin will always have a special place in my heart and I’m still hodling some, I’m afraid it’ll go the way of the dinosaur if they can’t keep up and innovate.

But how can the IRS tell if you’re moving to a personal wallet or to another exchange wallet for purposes of investments?

Based on notification from Coinbase regarding taxes, taking bitcoins out of the exchanges may constitute as a taxable event. Is this true? I get that if you take bitcoin out of coinbase or another exchange to trade for fiat or other cryptos it would count as a taxable event but if you’re just moving it from one wallet to another, there wouldn’t be right? It’s like moving money from one pocket to another.

If major countries all ban it because it helps finance terrorist or other nefarious activities.

Agree with everything you mentioned. On top of it all, the barrier to entry is so low that you have all these new altcoins out there already and surely many more to come. Some of them are truly novel and have even better technology behind them. If you’ve tried using bitcoin to pay for anything then you know how slow it can be and how variable the fees are. If they don’t fix these things I don’t see how they can compete with cryptocurrencies that already worked out those kinks.

Not all, ripple has been the green in a sea of red.

Xrp runs circles around btc in terms of speed. In this day and age, if you want mass adoption and eventual replacement of fiat then I can’t picture anyone waiting 3 minutes at the checkout line for your tx to confirm.

Yea! Asking for a friend.
