What do you have against my B1tC01n5?

Yes and no.
All of BitGo's keys could be compromised but the attacker was only able to acquire a second key from BFX, but this is extremely unlikely.
BitGo could've simply willingly signed with their key, in which case they are not compromised, but their fraud detection is massively incompetent.

BFX claims their cold-storage key is un-compromised.  For the attacker to have acquired 2/3 keys they must have compromised both BFX and BitGo's key.  
There are 3 possibilities:
1. BFX is wrong about the integrity of their cold-storage key (bad)
2. BitGo's key was compromised &amp; their statement inaccurate (worse)
3. Attacker bypassed need for keys and BitGo's entire operation is compromised (worst)

In that situation BitGo would be as much responsible as BFX.  The whole reason BitGo is getting paid in the first place is to vet transactions - if they willingly signed off on this clearly fraudulent transaction then their service is worthless.

If a user claims to have had business with Gox in a class action lawsuit, and provides information to support it (such as balances, transaction history, etc) and then Gox turns around and says 'our database shows no record of any of this' couldn't a tweet at the user thanking them for being a customer of Gox be construed as an acknowledgement of their patronage and evidence gox is lying &amp; has altered their records?

They're being sarcastic.

I know there's a lot of uncertainty with Bitfinex with the whole tether thing going on, but I still think the exchange has proven itself responsible with how it handled the hack.  It would've been easy to say "sorry we lost your Bitcoin they're gone bye now" but they chose to uphold their commitments to their customers as best they could. 
Doesn't help if you're in the US, and it would be real nice for them to clarify what's going on with the tethers, but when it comes to 2x they were sat on the fence and didn't come down on one side or the other, exactly how I would like an exchange to behave.

Got a pair of microcomputer boards in a drawer I would set up on LN if it ends up being possible. 
It always seemed odd to me that nodes were so essential for a robust network but didn't get a cut of transaction fees like miners did.  Even if nodes got only 1% of transaction fees I bet there would a hell of a lot more nodes running.
