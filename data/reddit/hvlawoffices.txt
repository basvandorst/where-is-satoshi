No, the assets of the bank would be either sold to another bank or auctioned or transferred in some way or another. For instance, when WAMU went under, the US Office of Thrift Supervision put the bank into receivership and Wells Fargo picked up the mortgages. Even though WAMU was the original lender and they no longer exist, a chain of ownership of the note can be demonstrated and Wells Fargo would have standing to foreclose.

Yes. Brand new just for this transaction. There are a number of ethics rules for retainer fees that we are beholden to and are internally ensuring are met.

This is the most common result. Uncontested, amicable divorces. Most people marry generally compatible spouses.

Even in an uncontested divorce, if there are significant assets, you absolutely need a stipulation of settlement that outlines the rights and restrictions and divides up the assets properly. Otherwise, good luck when the spouse comes back to court looking for her share of whatever property wasn't settled by the judgment or maintenance, or whatever.

If you can find a neighborhood you like, you can make it work pretty well as a local presence.

Just H &amp; V, the little statue does look like an I though... I should look into that.

Nothing I'm aware of at the moment, but it would be a good topic for CLEs in estate, divorce and ethics at least.

Hey, that's [me]( AMA (that isn't confidential, naturally)! 
Certainly didn't expect to end up seeing my own name on reddit today.

Of course not, just like you can't help it if someone robs your house and the $100,000 in cash you keep there. You're not going to get dinged by the Court if you, in good faith, lost or had assets stolen from you.

I just made it, I have a personal account too, but this makes more sense to use.

Forensic accounting and imputed value. You don't need disclosure if it's clear that a party is withholding.

No, I just find Bitcoin interesting and thought it would be exciting to use it in a business transaction. It's easy to transfer and I was able to get an instantaneous retainer rather than wait for a check to clear.

Depends on what you want to do. It's a bit of a crap-shoot, financially, but working at something you love is a great thing.

It's securepass - it's so I don't have to go through metal detectors at the Courthouse. I just renewed it. All you need to do is pay a fee and submit an electronic application for renewal, then wait, then pick up your fresh new ID at whatever Courthouse you had it sent to.

That's for a Court to determine. If there is evidence of a spoliation, it can be imputed back to the party. 
If the excuse for the loss is in good faith a Court won't penalize the party, but if it appears that the loss or disappearance was for the purposes of defrauding the other party, it won't go over well. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:27:13
It's family law, so you need to establish your case with a preponderance of the evidence. Basically, prove it was more likely than not. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:33:31
The Court deals with mental states all the time. How does someone prove *intent*? Extrapolating from all the other existing evidence and making an educated deduction.

I had to call our accountant ( - give him a plug) to let him know to figure it out. That's his job. Income is income, but I don't know taxes or how it should be documented there.

Our standard flat rate for an uncontested divorce without children or assets is $1085. Different fees apply for different circumstances and needs, however.

We have one, but the partners weren't using it. Someone else noted the whole lack of technological adoption among lawyers... Well, there you go. Easy as hell to use, but they kept sending emails from their personal accounts instead and screwing up the record keeping for emails.

As a rule, it is a bad idea to spoliate the evidence of your finances in contemplation of a divorce.

Not just in the divorces, we've won foreclosure defense cases, like this one: 
Which rendered a bank's claim against a house ineffectual.

So easy. QR codes are basically idiot proof. I don't see why we wouldn't continue using them if people prefer to pay with them.

You're thinking about it from the wrong way around. It's not the memory that's of concern, it's the evidence of the existence of the asset. For instance, if I got a divorce in 15 years, my spouse might still remember that time I was reddit famous for 15 minutes related to a bitcoin account. If I were to say, "Oh, I forgot about that, it was lost a decade ago - I have no way of accessing that anymore." That would probably be perfectly acceptable. If, on the other hand, I spent the next 15 years talking to everyone I meet about bitcoin, then my same excuse would ring quite hollow. How could I have lost and forgotten about something I spent 15 years bragging about? Any competent human being should be able to see through my obvious ruse. Even if I legitimately lost my key at that point, it becomes my burden to demonstrate how, when and why it was lost and prove that it is actually more likely than not that I cannot access it. Otherwise, even if I can't - my spouse can impute the value of the asset and collect her equitable share.

I definitely do. We have a general practice firm, so it stays interesting. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:34:46
A lot of it is definitely due to the stiff upper lip culture we're indoctrinated into and just the fact that even with new concepts, we have to think of everything in terms of how to fit those new concepts into old ways of thinking when dealing with case law. We're not a big firm, so we're a little more flexible in general.

Lol thanks for the gold, but I might have been too late to the party. 
Not that I'm complaining, I'm probably better off working rather than redditting....
