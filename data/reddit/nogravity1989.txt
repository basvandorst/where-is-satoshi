The reason you get interest on a bank account is because you've loaned the bank your money, when you are your bank there's no loan=no interest owed but also no one taking your deposits and making 10-15% gains on them while paying out 0.05% on some shitty savings account. You are the bank therefore there's no need for a bank to pay interest, it would be like you paying yourself. No point.

Are you specific to cash only? Coinbase is what I use in Alberta here and it's a base fee of 1$ (give or take) and then it's a 1% fee on top. So if you buy 20$ worth you pay 6% fees including the dollar charge, but the moment you go over 50$ worth of exchanged fiat for Bitcoin the fee drops lower then 3%. I've only exchanged a 1000$ at a time at most but when I did that amount the fee was 10.9$ or 1.09%. 
I know you said "for cash" but you also said you didn't wanna pay 3-5% fees so I figured I'd just tell you about what I use and as far as I know it's less then 3% easily depending on the quantity exchanged and acquired. If you are specific to cash I do apologize. 
Also if there's some random cost to coinbase I'm missing that someone knows about id be all ears to listen and potentially switch the service I use for acquiring bitcoin.

I'm Canadian and the crazy American political system also scares me at the moment. Bernies the only one who's not crazy but his grasp on economics is.
