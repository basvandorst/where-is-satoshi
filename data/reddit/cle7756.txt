There is no penalty. When you sell, if you have made a profit, then you pay taxes on that profit. If you buy in at a lower price, then that just gives you a better opportunity to make an additional profit.

Easier to think of it on a per coin basis. If you were to have 10 coins at $100 each, then the price rises to $200 and you sell 5 coins. So you owe taxes on the profit made on those 5 coins which is $500. Gains/losses are not realized until you sell.

Beware that if you buy again within 30 days it is considered a wash sale and you cannot claim that loss on your taxes.
