Besides having escrow ontop of the current system You can also do 3 Part Multisig
I.e lets say You sell something on ebay. You will only get the money after either the customer, or eBay releases your Money. This is even better than escrow since You can still get the money should eBay close. (And obviously eBay can Release the money when the customer isnt doing it) this is even better and is the Same thing (modern) darknet Markets use

Thats the end goal. You can only mine 21 Million Bitcoin, Sure every halving the Market is technically manipulated but the halving is always predictable and at some Point all those 21 Million Bitcoin are mined. No new btc then.
You can always print more and unlimited fiat (and You can do it very fast)
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:35:06
Also I cant confirm this but I'm pretty sure the price of BTC is just generated by trading bots. Network usage isn't high enough to justify a price this high. They feed off each other, the bots with the most greedy margin settings and trading strategy get eaten by the smarter, private, and probably way more careful professional bots (that have less risk and less return, there are plenty of public bots available but they are high risk w

Why risk being the First one? You shouldnt play with your freedom like this. Tracing Bitcoin has been made trivial why would anyone take any additional risk when There are better options available. Maximize your chances of not being caught 
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:52:20
300-1000% Profit margin
Lots of the big vendors get their supply with Crypto aswell
Online drug markets and offline Markets are mostly disconnected. Jesus of Rave exclusivly sells his LSD Crystals for Crypto currency and Synthesis them himself. Yes he has to buy some precursors for Fiat but Most of His Profits He keeps in Crypto (again in BTC/BCH/XMR These are the 3 currencies used in online drug sales, although its mostly XMR now since Bitcoin is too easy to trace)
So while - yes obviously they don't keep 100% in crypto - they do keep *most* of it in crypto, creating an upwards pressure on the price 
(Since more btc/BCH/XMR has been bought than it has been sold) 
So OP is still correct its NOT and equilibrium 
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:20:37
Using BTC for drugs at all is useless when Monero exists, even has cheaper Transaction fees
And why can't You understand that Just because it hasnt happend YET that it is still POSSIBLE that it COULD happen. I Just dont understand why anyone would risk anything when it comes to spending their life in prison? Its getting easier to trace Bitcoin Every day, I'm Just Not gonna Take that risk when I can Just use Monero (or tumbl, but BTC TX Fees are so high that that is indeed pricy)
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:07:23
Yeah no fam, I've been with Bitcoin since the beginning, These days I only use XMR for dnms tho, because again - tracing Bitcoin is trivial and why on earth would I Take any additional risk I dont need to take - thats like not wearing a seatbelt because "I havnt been in an accident yet and it will probably never happen anyway" 
Go ahead and give me a single valid reason why you should take additional risks that can be so easily avoided. Hell why should I get my Flu vaccines? I havnt had the Flu yet so its Probably Impossible for me to get it anyway 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:58:49
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:25:39
Not a single smart vendor Exchanges even half of his crypto to cash
Profit margins for Most drugs are about 300-1000%, and its way way easier to Store 100k$ in BTC/BCH/XMR than it is to Exchange and launder them to fiat (way safer too)
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:37:54
Tell me one thing Bitcoin can do that isnt being a currency (which it currently fails at) and being a Store of value (which it also currently fails at) that plenty of alt coins can't do better 
Shit even dogecoin has better TPS and lower TX Fees and thats a meme coin 
Bitcoin doesnt even have smart contracts or graphene, other Crypto currencies are way ahead of Bitcoin in Every single aspect (TPS, TX Fees, Block propagation time, privacy/tracability, decentrilization, Not relying on barely working second layer protocols)
I'm not gonna sell my bags even if Bitcoin hits zero but its Just sad to (currently) see it bleeding so hard

Im just gonna give up, its impossible to change your mind. Probably nothing will happen to you, and I honestly hope nothing does because drug laws are a bunch of bullshit. But dont Go around telling people it is perfectly Safe when it is provable not so. I wasnt talking about reducing risk in loosing a Bit of cash in the 5min your BTC is on an Exchange, I was talking about reducing the risk of *going to prison for the rest of your life*
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:14:54
I'm holding BTC (and buy some every month) and also have some BCH in my wallet (way less than BTC) and some ETH too, but I can never really use either. Most of the time its way easier  and often even cheaper to just pay with paypal. For the darknet markets I use BTC -&gt; XMR to stay anonymous
I'm very  dissapointed with the way Bitcoin is heading but it has the Bitcoin name so I hold mostly it (BTC) since I believe it will be worth more in the future simply because of first-to-market advantage
I personally believe BCH (ABCs) (SVs attempt at 64MB blocks was just laughably bad) on-chain scaling, combined with Graphene is alot better than LN (atleast currently) and according to stress tests it seems to work very well so far, on the other hand I really like SegWit and think BCH should have definitly forked with SegWit. Having 2 or 4MB blocks AND SegWit wouldn't impact 99% of nodes at all and would stop disasters like last December with 50$ TX Fees from happening. Enforcing 1MB blocks is stupid and unnecessary and it was never supposed to be kept at 1MB, the other extreme of having 64MB blocks or even bigger ones is equally stupid and unnecessary - atleast with current technology
just my 2ct tho

Doesnt really matter since they can't trace the resulting Monero TX anyway but okay - dont use those shady websites. Use Kraken instead You can Buy your Bitcoin with USD or EUR and Then If you want drugs, get some Monero with your BTC and done

Not everyone buys only a g of coke
Were I am you can get life for a single sheet of acid, and if blockchain tracing gets even cheaper and easier, they definitly would try and get the low hanging fruit - just to inspire fear in the generell population - and I ain't going  away for a sheet of acid. And if gets even cheaper than that they would probably pay 5$ to get someone buying a G of coke - again just to inspire fear
Again - why take even the tiniest amount of risk with no benefits

Crypto currencies have Always been about non-fakable/chargebackable, verifiable (and fast) transactions and decentrilization.
LN Covers the non fakable/chargeback and the fast part fairly well (atleast so far, its Pretty tiny and There are concerns about scalability within LN), it isnt publicly verifiable tho and it is fairly centralized
I can Just use visa instead of LN, its easier to use too

Bitcoin is not Anonymous at all unless you buy some BTC with cash. If you buy Bitcoin anywhere with your Identity attached (Coinbase, BitStamp, Kraken whatever) it isnt Anonymous anymore:
It Used to be Anonymous but alot of process has been made in the last few years, and it gets easier to trace every day 
You can Decide for yourself If you buy drugs - risk being the first buyer in history to be tracked and spend life in prison for a Bit of convinience - or don't do that. Yes, no buyer has been tracked with Blockchain Analysis yet. Yes, it is unlikely You will be the first. But why risk it 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:25:47
Really that one sentence is what you are gonna reply too?
The network is working great /right now/ because barely anyone is using it. Look at the mess that happened in december. Right now its a few cents yeah, might be 50$ again tomorrow tho
And like I said for DNM shit I use Monero, which also has way way way lower TX fees compared to BTC and even rivaling BCH, and its even anonymous
But I'm just a stupid bcasher and alt coin chill so what do I know /s
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:31:42
Yes because using some instant Exchange is risking loosing money? You dont even need to hold Monero, I dont either - I Just use it to buy drugs... BTC -&gt; Monero -&gt;Market Deal (hopefully multi-sig) it takes an entire 10 seconds more and costs around .2% more 
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:15:53
Yeah Pretty easily, but I wouldnt if I were you. Bitcoin is way to easy to trace 
Either use a tumbler which is still relativly risky or use coinshift or smth Like that to use your BTC to pay with Monero (XMR) on the markets
If you want to find Out more Go to deepdotweb (Just Google it) I recommend WSM

If the entire hashrate of china stopped overnight there would either be a 51% attack by russia or bitcoin would crash to shit since transactions would take ages to confirm
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:32:07
Every smart Person did, people seriously underestimate tracing, even tumbling once isnt good enough anymore 
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:10:28
Using BTC is a waste for DNMs

Coinbase is garbage anyway, no idea why anyone would use it.
BitStamp has WAY less fees, an actual support team, quicker verifications and a nicer user interface 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:06:47
Coinbase ist the worst of the available exchanges anyway, they used to be the only option for many - no idea why anyone is using them nowadays

I like the chinese ETH ripoff, neo is pretty cool
ETH is cool too
Most altcoins just add nothing they are just a clone, ETH, NEO even LTC all bring new stuff to the table, most do not
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:48:43
I have nothing to add to this
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:02:42
They can just ban / block all the exchanges, price would crash even with decentralised exchanges. All the money locked in coinbase gone overnight!

Are you happy about destroying the lives of so many people?
You did so much for Bitcoin, both positive and negative, but it just makes me sad when I think about all the people that lost everything, sure its their fault for trusting an exchange but still man, that sucks

They are scamming my btc atm, 40€ taken from my EUR Wallet, btc transaction says "will arive at 25.07" lmao
another transaction atleast got created but is not confirming
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:38:39
I have one transaction pending that says my BTC will arive 25.07 lol nobody is working in their support center apparently
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:36:17
Would your support mind solving my 80€?
Coinbase took 40€ from my EUR Wallet without giving me BTC (says it will arive on 25.07)
Other 40€ are not confirming for hours on blockchain 
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:55:12
Sorry, thats just Not how asymetrical encryption works. There is no "master key" or predictable Algorithm that can create a private Seed for Every Public seed (without having the Recovery Seed for that specific Key)
In fact, everyone - including myself - knows the original Hash function that is used to generate new keypairs. Thats the entire Point.
I would advise You to Take a 101 cryptography Class in your local University before saying stuff Like that 
Oh and btw, having to store a Ton of gold also Costs Rent

Coinbase took 40€ from my Wallet
I never recieved BTC, the "transaction" says "Will arive at the end of the day Monday 25.07" what a joke, support isnt working shit
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:34:45
Pretty sure Coinbase is pulling a MtGox,
40€ from my Wallet, got no BTC, says BTC will arive 25.07 (lul)
40€ in BTC send with apparently no transaction fee
