It’s a meme. It originated from a guy who had no idea what to do during a crash, a noob. He said he’s just going to “hodl” onto his coins instead of “hold” on accident.

I’m doing pretty solid actually. The most I bought for was 15500 and I got out on the last big spike, when it went to 17k, I sold for 16500. I was considering putting an order in at 13500 yesterday but decided against it. Institutions pump and dump to steal from the majority.

BTC isn’t designed for small transactions. Everyone seems to think of crypto like it’s a race or a competition when they’re designed for different uses. BTC was programmed to act like a precious metal. A store of value

You’re at risk of a dip happening. It could go up to 12-13k within the week but it’s best to buy right after a bull run. 9400 2 days ago was optimal and it was there for hours.

Using your bank account takes around 7 days. You should’ve gotten an email confirmation with an estimated delivery time. There’s only a 1% fee when using a linked bank account. Debit cards are instant but the fee is Around 6%. Once you’ve completed a bank account transaction, there’s no way to undo it.

Bitcoin is a speculation game. If you look at the Long term growth of bitcoin, there’s a consistent pattern. If 1% of world money goes into bitcoin, bitcoin would be worth around 1 million per coin.. I bought in at 8200 which was the all time high at the moment.
