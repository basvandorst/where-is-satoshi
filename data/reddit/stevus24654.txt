French schools are among the best, a lot of work, and very long tests.
But, usually for a 4h test, you have more exercises than here, or is is a very very nice math teacher !

What about ETH ?
I expect most of the crypto trader who owns BTC to have some ETH, and it is so much faster.
But I think many new joiners have just bought “some BTC” by an easy to setup app (where you can pay by credit card), but don’t know about other cryptos.
I find it a real issues for IRL buys to have such a long confirmation time, I think on the long run, another crypto may be more often used than BTC because of this

In France you have 30 min to do the math.
Maybe she expected the time to inflate as much as the Bitcoin value ?

CFTC is well aware of the interest for BTC, but the law makers need more time than the early adopters to see the potential and value.
Unless taxing of course.
Nevertheless, this kind of article is very positive for the crypto community, even if I don’t think BTC will have a legal definition before at least medium term.

Good to have local initiatives to bring Cryptos to the people.
- did you had to spend a lot of time taking about BTC and why you accepted it as payment ?
- how would you have managed the time needed for the BTC tx to be validated ? How many validation were required ?

Are the insurances still working if you pay in BTC ?

When you get a new hardware wallet, always performed a full erase at first. 
You need to initialize it, they input 3 times a wrong password. 
This can be annoying, but it ensures your device is ready to store your keys.
