It's not about it being a peak. Nobody can predict the peak. But why would you buy an asset after it doubled in a week?
I swear to god these people just throw their money away without thinking.
"It doubled last week.. maybe it'll double this week even though the buy pressure is slowing down and everyone is talking about how much money they made and how they need to take profits..."
It's the kind of mistake you can only really make if Bitcoin is your first venture into finance

I use Kraken

To each their own, I got in at .20 BTC/BCH and out at .5

Last night on Kraken when the Koreans woke up and pumped BCH and BTC dropped as people panic exchanged
It's been all over the place the past 36 hours. See my post history for my gains

Solid investment today.. It's been going up. Get in and out on the rise and there's lots of money to be made

Shit out of luck most likely without at least a knowledge of which service they were on. That wallet could be ANYWHERE. Sorry man.

I would think so, yep
People who held too long lost all their money to people who sold quick enough

Can I ask u a question? WHY? Why would you buy an asset as its at its peak in a rise? Especially a big investment... No sarcasm I'm trying to understand your mindset
