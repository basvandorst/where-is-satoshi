It is my understanding that segwit only makes the space more efficient. So will not what you are saying be wrong? It will be 1mb but can be "equivalent" to a slightly higher block size like 2 or max 4.
@_date: 2016-04-17 23:29:40
Ok thanks! Did some reading and yes I am a bit wrong. As I now understand it the signatures are removed from the normal input data and put in its own structure. To maintain backward compatibility and also gain some space in the process this is not counted when block size is calculated. I am also guessing SPV clients dont need this extra signature data so a small gain on bandwidth here.
Am I getting a bit closer to the truth?

As a collective i agree. We need purpose. But i disagree that purpose means that everybody has to work for money forever. A life's purpose could be more than working to survive.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:20:21
Money is not energy. It is a construct we have created to measure how much you have done in comparison to others. We did not always have money. Energy started with universe

If we every reached the stage where automation could sustain us. Would you accept it? 
I see the ever increasing "unemployment" of the world not as a problem only a result of that many jobs are disappearing to machines. I believe at some point we should accept the luxury that we have created. A gradual solution would be to gradually decrease the amount of work people have to do. This would be true self evolution 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:59:08
I imagine a world where automation will take care of most if not all of production. Being able to live without work will be a right to all. If one whishes to live a more luxurious life then then education and work will still exist but might not be for all. But maybe i am just an optimist 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:48:04
I agreed with this before but slowly realizing that i might just be too used to the capitalistic view. The world is getting better. At which point will we realise that everybody does not need to work?

Arguments and not statements would be nice..
Edit: seems you are talking about using energy? (Doing "work" in physics) then i agree and that is what plants and animals do. They do not work to make money though. Working for getting money is the point here

Really good research. Great research in fact! And some modest but really good conclusions. Thank you.
User targeting.
I am going to not look at the targets' comments to keep AFAIcan unbiased, but I think the data speaks for itself. It is targeted. About the 2 votes: it _might_ be the number that the attacker saw fit to not get caught. Nobody notices 0 posts but 300+ ? Ill leave it at that.
False positives.
This really reflects my whole comment. With this much data, statistically, it does not make sense. Nobody knew you were running this (or they assumed everybody was running something, but still). Yes there are trends that might be wrong, and it should not be ignored. But there will always be an error approximation.
Vote fuzzing.
I do not post/comment a lot on reddit so I do not know. 


besides the point but here goes: On this subreddit, is this chosen? Because I have on 'best' but sometimes it changes to 'controversial' . Enlighten me, but I do not want the controversial discussion here. Ill make an own post.
Admin response.
Bureaucracy but good that they are doing something.
Other comments.
Again, real quality research. Thank you.
EDIT: My comments went into the quote. So changed that.

Its funny because this is one of the main arguments of Peter Todd to not support BU - That nation states will buy up the hash power. So in your view is this not an argument anymore?

When this becomes news you know we've reached a low point..
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:57:09


where have you been? Both luke and Theymos (though not a dev) have both at some point said raising the limit was a must. Saying luke is consistent is, in general, a long leap. The UASF proposal is an excellent example on double moral standard. Its ok to change the very essence of bitcoin if its in their favour but a simple block size increase.. oh no. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:42:03
I am sorry but this is not quite right. How long have you been around? 32, 8, 4, 2mb and dynamic proposals have been put forth. Most of the BU camp would've been satisfied with this at some point, but core have not been willing to budge, and now everybody is at their breaking point. Some of the employees of blockstream signed an agreement to put forth a 2mb proposal within some months after segwit but also then failed to do so. (Officially it was not blockstream, only employees and Core contributors) 
To say that its BU proponents that are not willing to compromise, when you look at the last 2 years, is wrong. Not saying that Core are not in their right to do so though.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:12:38


I can not find any info on this but IIRC they said they were testing (but dont quote me on that). And also, IMO, if one mining pool misbehaves when about 10 signed I wouldnt say that makes it ok for Core developers to do what they want. It was a deal with Core - from many mining pools and companies. So a many to one relation if you will.


Would love to see some references! He did put forth some pretty childish proposals.


Because that is exactly what the big block camp DONT want, and never wanted.. We want a HF because it eases technical debt and doesn't put to much power into one developer team. If you can remember this whole discussion did not start out as political as it has become. It was a technical one. These were the arguments from the beginning. IMO SFs also set a precedence. Most people dont pay attention to what is put into a release so they are unaware that they are actually voting for something. I believe this puts to much power into the development team and makes it easy to slip in non consensusified proposals.


Saying "my idea is the best - deal with it" is not comprimising. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:28:14


I think most will agree with this. The one thing I feel some dont understand is that the dev team itself is an attack vector. Buying them would presumably be cheaper than buying hashes. Not trying to step on anybodies toes here.. I have huge respect for all the the dev teams and I'm not trying to attack anybodies integrity. I just think this is the way I would "attack" (god I hate that term.. dont really think any side is "attacking" - its just strong different opionions) bitcoin in theory.

haha. I said dont!! god damn it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:57:01
Segwit also increases the block size. Up to 4mb (theoretically). It "cheats" the block size measurements by sending two data structures where one is not counted. It will be possible for light wallets to only verify the 1mb block though (though full verification will not be done)
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:50:48
Well clearly you did not understand my post then. I was pointing out that the quote is IMO almost irrelevant in this post's context. Both because the way nodes and miners now are decoupled and how mining has got an extra centralisation factor of pooled mining that I believe SN didn't foresee. I do agree that mining farms was inevitable (even desirable?), it is the way it was intended and that the system today is flawed. I believe a big factor was pooled mining.


Enough with the master suppression techniques. That is the main reason the comment section is going to hell..
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:51:49
That quote is about nodes, not miners. As i understand one of the things satoshi didnt forsee was pooled mining.

no LN is not so confusing. Some try to sell it that way. Its a network like any other but adding a "if I owe alice 2 *money* how can bob pay me when I owe alice." and this has to happen quickly.

There are some serious theoretical difficulties with LN and how to find peers. Point being, nobody knows yet how to implement it properly..

Check if you find a ~10 words sequence. He might have moved them to another wallet with such a backup. But dont share this with anyone

I actually find his point pretty good. He argues that it is the FBI or the governments responcebility to surveile and 'protect' the citizens and its their job to find ways to do that. In essence its not society's responcebility to do the job for them. That is what I get from his main body argument.
Further I always try to compare communicating on the internet as talking to each other in person. Some conversations are public some are private. Imagine if the government suddently wanted everybody to wear microphones to make their job 'easier', when in fact it is their job to actually find out what happend AFTER something illegal or dangeous has happened. Which I personally have nothing against. It is their job after all. 
imho that puts the whole surveillance debate in more perspective.

wow. At least we spread the wealth among us instead of among the ~10 people that actually found it.. but I guess if you looked up sosialism you may find that out for yourself
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:45:02
I wasnt going to reply to this.. but then I found this just now..
I know its all wrong. Its Iceland, not Norway. This is about ideology, not police nor politics. And the news source is pretty shit and biased.. And discussing politics on the internet is like discussing politics (or religion for that matter..) while you are drunk. Its just wrong. 
But having so cute problems as in the article says at least a tiny bit about how nice it is. IMHO.
I did read up a bit on sosialism. And my impression is that there is no real definition on it. At least not one definition. From what you wrote I think you have an extreme and old view of what it really is. It has for sure, nothing to do with Sweden or Scandinavia (Good example?!). That is just wrong. IMO it has more to do with EU (In Swedens case) then anything else. And then you are comparing Venuzuela and Japan.. come on. Corrupt will always be corrupt, no matter what ideology. Stealing and kidnapping?! I agree that will not make people more creative, productive or work capable.

I think you overestimate the simplicity of centralized services. Its not ONE sql database. It is many seperate ones that needs to be synced. Bitcoin is ONE common database. If you consider this its very much hard to prove.
