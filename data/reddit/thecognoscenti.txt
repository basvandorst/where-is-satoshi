Sqig look at it this way.  I can spend the $1000 on some post graduation experience or put it somewhere I'm passionate about.  Paying $1000 on 30-35k of school debt is not a terrible decision but at the same time either is taking a shot on BTC. 
Weighing the pro's vs con's if you are a bitcoin advocate as myself I'm surprised to hear so much disapproval, but there is always two sides of the coin.

The presentation is so I can buy some.  Rather than spend my graduation gift on a place to travel or something of that nature I would rather purchase roughly $1000 of BTC.  
In terms of selling it to someone I might disagree with you as that is what is and has been happening for some years now.  All successful ideas must be sold at some point and if mainstream adoption is expected, people like my parents are going to be sold on the idea.  If people can not grasp the concept through the clarity of other people introducing them to the topic it may be hard for the growth to continue.  
Every day the infrastructure is evolving and being simplified for everyday people I don't see why I can't be a part of that process.

Thanks for your input.  I agree with you and I do believe there is a lot of upside.  On the contrary there is more than significant risk and I am fully willing to take this on. Good to hear, I was beginning to feel like I'm making a terribly wrong decision when it's the first thing I've been passionate about in a long time.  I understand it may be impulsive and irrational but why not take a chance for such a small amount of money in the grand scheme of things.

Thanks, that is a great starting point to peak interest and get their focus.  I agree that it can be just as disruptive of a technology as the internet was.
In your opinion do you think bitcoin holds the potential to truly be global currency or are you more interested in it as a protocol or payment system?

You're right, I probably shouldn't have called it investing as I know it's simply speculation.  I should have called this an educational experiment as I think getting involved and owning a somewhat significant portion of BTC as a 22 year old can be very beneficial.  
I don't mean beneficial in a financial sense where I simply check Zeroblock every day hoping for prices to rises, but rather continuing to get involved at the forefront of a revolutionary technology which long-term can help generate creativity, create relationships and inspire critical thinking more than a low-risk investment may. 
It's not about having safe principal as I am at an age where I am willing to take on a lot of risk.  It's not a huge sum of money that would be detrimental to my future.  
I'm talking about $1000 here.

Interesting read but I have a question for you guys.  I work at a financial institution where we wire funds to our clients daily.  Our clients typically need the money quicker than we can provide it to them as a wire can take longer than desired, especially if its on a Friday.  With bitcoin this could entirely speed up the process and if i'm not mistaken not limit us to M-F for funding our clients.  So what I'm asking is there a business out there that we could use to replace our wire transfers with bitcoin deposits that automatically convert to fiat.  Additionally we would need to be a very simplified process where both our institution and our clients would not need to sign up for a bitcoin exchange etc nor have an intuitive understanding of the bitcoin protocol.  Speed and simplicity is what I'm asking about.  Any ideas?

We are an alternative lender so our clients need funds.  They can be their own bank all they want but in the end they need the money that we provide to them.  Is there an alternative way to do provide them with the funds without a wire at this point in time?

Ya I bought a very small amount on Coinbase a few weeks ago just to understand how a transaction would play out.  By setting up a full node what do you mean? Is this how you become a miner?  I do not have expertise in computer skills and I fear mining might fall outside of my scope.  
I was actually just thinking.  What if I began helping local companies around me accept bitcoins and for this service I charge .5% or 1% some fee like that on all transactions that go to me.  Is this a possible business model?

Check into Coinbase and Blockchain, used properly they are some highly respected sites within the BTC community.

Thanks, that's a great idea.  I could possibly get a club started on campus where we toss around some ideas and just involved and comfortable with talking to other people on the subject.
