If you think bitcoin "network" is just some code then Im not sure what to tell you... good luck at life. Youre going to need it. ;-)

If you have come to reddit for investing advice, you have already failed. Never knew the world had so many fortune tellers. How many people here are rocking magic eight-balls?

Why do you say bum and not turd cutter?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:45:29
Not being serious... Though that was obvious. Sorry.

Whales still milking weak hands... Money to be made.

Want to develop nerves of steel? Buy BTC and stay glued to GDAX 24/7 and HODL!! Drops like this hardly phase me anymore...
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:05:51
I like the way you think. Same boat. Still holding HODling a set. Rather be a sucker than a scared pussy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:37:26
Yeah and I am one of them... I do feel like a dick after the fact. It was a tasteless joke. :(
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:53:59
All of you people hoping it will go lower by spreading BS FUD... you know you can buy a fraction of BTC, right? You can probably afford .001 BTC and join team HODL. :D
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:19:18
Peace out, weak hands...

If this goes to zero will my cars and house still be paid off? Will chicks still let me ATM if my bitcoins are worthless?
I kinda got used to and grew fond of these things.
Im scared.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:53:03
No, but people can stop panic selling and they will probably stop shystering if there are no suckers left to shyster.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:42:46
Buy and HODL. Volume is low... once sellers dry up and traders ru out of cash, only HODlers left. We go to the moon again. GLTA
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:23:55
I saw a LOT of people crack this weekend. Something about that slow, methodical grind down finally broke some HODLers. Complete manipulation IMO. Seems the whales are testing the bottom. Too bad if you sodl.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:51:54
Correct... both of these things. :D
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:04:12
The people that are playing BTC like a casino are turning it into one. I imagine some are making money actively trading BTC, but most are losing. Wait till they run out of $ and just HODl'ers left, then we will see ATH.

Thu phuck dude, you dont even know my sign. What a noob.

People need to grow some scones and wait for the bounce at the very least.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:15:47
ROFLMAO... Fat girls need loving too!
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:18:40
Noobs got rekt today. Welcome to bitcoin. This shit gets real. Cant handle the swings, then geeet the fuck out... back to something your stomach can handle, like collecting pogs.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:09:38
Do it... then let us all know where you shorted.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:11:30
Thats a quality meme right there.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:38:08
I think it will go up unless it goes down.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:35:13
I bought a Prusa 3D printer with BTC... as well as a few other things. Piece of cake. Makes one think that if BTC ever stabilizes, wouldn't need a bank account at all.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:24
I think most BTC being held by HODL'ers, IMO. We would see MUCH more volume otherwise.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:57:20
Fine by me...
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:21:05
Wondering if I can get my horoscope read here. Seems like the right place.

If BTC does make ATH again, may want to invest in Volkswagen who owns Lamborghini. Apparently there are a lot of potential buyers here.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:00:22
HODL! Institutional money is coming! May take months or even years. Be patient. Close that GDAX tab and relax!
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:07:30
Meh... the sooner we get to 6k the sooner we can get back to ATH. And the sooner trolls can get back to manning the glory holes at their local truck stop.
