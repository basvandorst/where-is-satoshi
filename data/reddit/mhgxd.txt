“Reposted” It was the first time the story got published. It’s fresh news to the public, hence you might be an insider so sorry if I’m getting in your way, but nobody from us knew it before bloomberg reported it.

Okay, he’s a well known guy. Why shall we believe him? I’m not believing bitfinexed either. I’m just skeptic that more than half a billion flew in 1 month into Tether/Bitfinex a company which is having problems with banks and changing them constantly.
Afaik, they promised audits themselves. So ‘it is hard to get audited’ is bs. Nobody is against Bitfinex because they are making money, we just don’t want them to become the nightmare of crypto.

You’re basically taking a word from someone who no-one knows, meanwhile Tether website doesn’t work for deposit/withdrawal, new account registration!? Like, how?

LMAO! It's just great how stupid you are. Tell me which coins are Coinbase,Bithumb or any other able to print and send to the market. Which? None! They didn't get hacked and create money out of thin air to spread on the market.
I don't even want to have an audit from Coinbase, since I don't even want to know how they spend their own money. But Bitfinex on the other hand IS FUCKING PRINTING MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR.
And I see you haven't mention any other exchange that accepts USDT like binance,kraken etc. You're a goddamn worshiper dude. Also, if you're at the point where you can analyse markets and charts, you'll plain see how the market gets pumped once Tethers are into play, but hey, who am I to judge you. Keep using them until you get burnt.
Have a nice day.

I'm not saying I believe Coinbase either, and you're basically saying, hey we are doing shit, but also others are doing shit, why you are after BFX only? What is your point? Shall we do one at a time, let's take BFX down if there is fraud going on there, and get back to Coinbase after them?
And this, is exactly what an proper audit would actually prevent:
I don't care what your reasons are, I don't know how a crypto user would go this long way to defend some company who might actually do more harm than good to the whole crypto and community. This is my last reply, as I'm not interested to go back and forth with you, but I'd seriously recommend not to try and defend anything at all by comparing to something else.

TLDR: Idgaf about your btc idealists, invested in Ripple and currently making millions.
But that was the original idea. People are shifting thoughts every day, 200k unconfirmed txs is a bullshit. I have 7 txs on hold for 3 days and that fcking sucks.
Most of crypto investors got in btc for money, that is the whole reason why btc has the value it has now, all while, bitcoin communities are killing themselves over Bcash, Bgold, Bshit, etc.
- A story now.
A friend asked me about bitcoin, I told him why he should research and decide whether to invest.
3 days after researching it, he didn’t tell me “Hey I’m going in Btc since it is capable of changing the world.”, instead his words were “There are talks that a kind of ‘fork’ will come soon, and whatever number of bitcoin you have, you will also get aftet that fork. That means investing in btc now is like investing in 2 coins. This will make me too rich in couple of months and I’ll get out of this shit.”
You see? Even the community has been presenting BTC as “get rich quick, get on asap, you’re missing the profit”.
I dont believe I saw a post getting in mainstream investor eyes that writes: “Hey, invest in Bitcoin, the technology is so good it has potential to change the world. Dont think about profit, lets take down banks.”
So, me as a man who gives 0 fucks about banks, because they won’t let you take away their power, even in your dreams, invests in Ripple on .20, makes a couple of millions, and is holding to 6$ when me has too many millions for a lifetime.
All while getting all them cashout to some nice fiat that is called $ and will be on my bank.
Happy New Year.

But atm you end up paying more fees than actual cost of ticket? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:48:46
Not where I live tho, I get a 2 day pass with 15€.
It’s cool, but still this just means btc fees are affordable for YOU.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:44:52
Once again, tell me more about btc superior that every man shall afford and make txs all over the world within seconds.
Oh wait, sorry, that is what Ripple is doing instead.
Get in your head, btc is not a religion and you are getting blind asf.

But y'all have no problem with Tether which has been printing for months now and is on all biggest exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:28:31
I mean the people after bots on the twitter giveaways would give up by now, but I am pretty sure people are stupid enough and try things like these. Smh
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:07:40
Come on, don't try to comment on stuff you didn't even care to research and understand. Ffs.

Katz quoted one crypto trader who said: "We're a bunch of dudes with a lot of money in our 20s. We like naked girls."

Smooth. Pretty nice, I'll be using it. Tho in the news, it is only connected to A feature to be able to select subreddits user wants would be cool.
