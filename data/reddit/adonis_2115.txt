Ha ha, we are just a bunch of developers, doing our part to bring bitcoin into more use. We only know about freelancers community and project building. We believe that this way, many people will start accepting bitcoin for there work.

I don't see send to many addresses in transaction functionality in electrum. Am I missing something?

Thanks for suggestion. Electrum guys did not work well on UI. BitPay was awesome in everything except Segwit.

It has a problem I can not add the normal address in address book expect Pynm bot or something which seems not suitable for me.

Bipay gives Fiat in (USD) in exchange of BTC. That's why they use BitPay they don't keep btc.

I understand I can run node. I am already running a couple of them. Here my question is 'Are there any services or sass who provide node as a service?'
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:22:41
Fetching balance, publishing signed transactions. Everything a node is used for except mining.
