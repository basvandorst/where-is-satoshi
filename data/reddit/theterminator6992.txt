I love bitcoin. I believe in bitcoin. I think(also hope) bitcoin will make me a tidy profit in the near future (3-5) years. 
This is also the worst piece of advice ive ever heard.
@_date: 2019-11-06 06:56:10
this dude said were in "a bull run" just sell me your bitcoin and get the fuck out of here
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:20:58
you 100 percent said 8k by august 15th. you made a wager with another user, he went back and forth with you for days. are you denying that you said definitively 8k by august 15th?
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:58:51
you're now telling people to buy bitcoin, even tho you personally have said you will never purchase bitcoin again and that purchasing before 8k would be foolish? 8k by august 15th
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:55:18
this comment aging really well dude.
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:32:42
etf denied. do explain fuck face
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:10:13
when 8k?
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:53:25
never thought he makes actual "predictions" just keeps blatantly saying "BITCOIN GO UP SOON" month after month lol
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:53:37
again, you are arguing over the exactness of a "time travelers" price prediction. think of it this way. go up to someone out in public, tell them about your day. let them know how you got into an argument on reddit with this guy who insisted the bitcoin time traveller prediction was correct, but really it was a year off in its prediction!
let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:22:14
you said 8k by august 15th in your wager with another user, saying you would admit your predictive abilities were garbage by that date, and if it wasn't by that date he would apologize to you. are you denying this?
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:41:04
lol you crack me up so predictable. SPEND WEEKS calling for 8k by august 15th, it fails, you push it back to 8k by august 22nd, you are no where to be seen, quiet like the little bitch you are. but of course, like clockwork, it goes down 800 dollars in a day, here you are with your typical bullshit. and you know whats crazy, even going down 800 dollars in a day, its still up 1400 dollars from your "prediction". smh when it goes back up youll go right back to shutting the fuck up
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:48:25
looks like he knows what hes talking about there fam.
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:53:12
oh we past that lol. hes made his original wager for august 15th, if you dm me and show me how to link previous comments ill show you the wager he made. its only now that hes moved it back to "mid august" aka "august 22nd"
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:38:38
why not just use a reputable fucking exchange. it pains me to see so many posts like this. yes, fees are frustrating. yes, linking your bank account and depositing funds is time consuming. but you know what its better than? GETTING SCAMMED LIKE A FUCKING MORON.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:55:47
how did 8k by august 15th work out? quite the "prediction"
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:16:04
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:27:31
follow your feelings to 8k by august 15th.
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:48:44
bro dont engage the troll. he purchased at BTC all time high of 20k and just spends his days going on different subreddits to troll. some days hes on the Donald, some days hes on the\_mueller. if you call him out on it, he goes back and deletes his comments. I now archive and screenshot all his shit to repost when this stuff goes down.
and yes, he repeatedly and blatantly called for 8k bitcoin by august 15th, then august 22nd, and now even today is sitting here saying he said "8k bitcoin by end of august." imagine having the stones to stfu for weeks, getting called out for being wrong everyday, but then pop in on the day bitcoin goes down 800 dollars and go "YEAH I KNEW IT GUYS". hes absolute poison, dont engage.
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:45:42
deserves more upvotes.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:19:35
dont you allegedly drive for uber and live on a couch? and complain that you make less money than mcdonalds workers? odd you would be talking down to anyone. how'd 8k by august 15th prediction work out?
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:26:58
yeah, copy and pasting what I said to you definitely shows me I was wrong, and you're in a good place mentally and emotionally in life. you really "got me". best of luck guy.
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:34:10
its because he Never actually purchases or sells any bitcoin that he can make such accurate, always accurate, predictions! well, minus his purchase at the all time high....
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:48:30
you guys are fighting about a "time travelers" internet price prediction. so yes, imagine being "that" delusional.
@_date: 2019-08-07 02:28:51
....isnt he the one making the initial office space reference? surely thats not just a coincidence lol
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:15:14
yeah man just not worth trying to get people in. its highly volatile and like so many of us im sure your friends won't be able to perfectly time the market. youre doing it right, investing what you can, so sit and wait and hope that it makes all your dreams come true. I personally just jack off over the thought of it going 100k and sending screenshots of my bank account to all the people who laughed at company Christmas dinner in December 2017.
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:24:41
fuck bro they out here scheming to keep that 31 dollars on hold
@_date: 2019-10-19 23:50:34
is this a serious question? her dollar buy came at a time when bitcoin was cheaper than your 5 dollar buy. what a fucking moron
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:43:25
END OF AUGUST? YOU SAID AUGUST 15TH? AND THEN AUGUST 22ND LOLOLOL. just stfu and watch like the rest of us. lord knows you have no fucking clue whats going to happen. do I really need to post the screenshotted history before you can go back and delete them?
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:36:04
exactly why I screenshotted all his old posts cus I knew he would try to edit and then proceed to get on his numerous alts. still waiting for 8k, the thing is he only uses his gut and intuition, which is why is why he is always correct! /s
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:51:10
u/sfxnyc 8k by august 15th? awfully quiet since your "prediction" didn't come true. but hey just keep pushing the deadline and maybe you'll continue to "always be correct"
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:31:55
please explain why price shot up if your theory was 100000 percent wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:04:24
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:10:14
lol are we really considering the 4chan prophet TA? trust me, im all for the ta thing being all hindsight bullshit in regards to bitcoin, but the last thing im gonna do is look at A LEGIT 4CHAN PROPHECY FEATURING AN ANIME CHARACTER and get upset about it. it coincidentally got two price corrections right, big deal man nothing to get worked up about. who would legit sit and be upset about it? "I cant wait till bitcoin doesn't fucking double its price this month and I can shit on the type of people who believe in 4chan anon anime posters price predictions for their investments"
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:05:06
buy hardware wallet. send coins to hardware wallet. save. I will never stop being amazed at how fucking stupid some people are. would you ever send you pin and routing info to a stranger on the internet? oh you wouldn't? so why the fuck are you sending what is essentially you bitcoin bank account and PIN number to internet strangers.
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:07:44
not commenting on op's comment, speaking firmly to sfxnyc prediction. but I do stand on the side that taking out a loan to invest in crypto stands on the higher end of the risk spectrum.
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:39:31
so its good an underage child is smarter than you were.
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:31:25
do you plan to admit your predictions for 8k by august 15th are a failure at the end of the day and uphold your end of your wager with the user?
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:49:30
why would anyone in the world just give you free money? if they are giving you free money, why do they need you to send them money? unreal how stupid people are
@_date: 2019-10-28 06:39:46
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:17:48
you are missing the point. youre arguing the semantics of accuracy of a time traveller post. WHO CARES???? lol so what if hes wrong about the accuracy of his time traveller post, HES TALKING ABOUT A FUCKING TIME TRAVELLER POST. stop living like this dude. go outside, make friends. be happy.
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:23:43
what a happy fulfilled life you must be living to find some sort of moral high ground in being the "Fact checker supreme" of reddit posts about time traveller bitcoin price predictions. smh I feel sorry for you man, I can only imagine how small, angry, and sad your life must feel right now. but know that you are loved, you can be happy, and it doesn't have to be this bad. you only have one life, I recommend you spend your time on this earth being happy,, rather than whatever sort of sick proto-satisfaction you get out of this.
@_date: 2019-12-18 06:14:52
is this where people are in the world? that they think there are literal "COINS" of bit?.....were so fucked
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:17:01
so you think theres just cats out there giving away something valued  over 1400 dollars right now (let alone its potential future value) for free? nothing about that seems fishy to you? its a scam, and its pathetic that there are people as gullible and fucking stupid out there as you. my god why do I waste my time breaking my back at 9-5 when theres so many dumb fucks like you out there I could just be scamming if I simply lowered my moral code
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:26:45
why would you send a stranger bitcoin for nothing? what an idiot
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:30:37
coinbase pro could do it for like 8 dollars.
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:55:37
absolutely I can help you out in 2 years
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:52:48
if its more about adoption why are you using your own code? shit like this is why people are wary of bitcoin and term it a "Ponzi scheme"
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:02:52
fun new bet. bitcoin hits 50k or grrm releases winds, which comes first? I would hammer the fuck out of bitcoin 50k.
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:38:51
yeah, he baited you, its called a long con.  and youre an idiot
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:25:08
I use chase and havent had any issues ever.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:54:43
I gotcha, I better understand your question now. So lets say hypothetically you're stuck in an area that is without internet for a week/a month etc. Now your bitcoin still holds the same value because the rest of the world isn't affected by this. so lets say its at 10k, and then war happens, and its still at 10k. you kept your value. but you have no internet or infrastructure that is currently needed to access/swap out your bitcoin for fiat. does bitcoin have value still? absolutely. Does it have any value to you at that moment? absolutely fucking not. without internet you can't access your exchange, load up your hard wallet and send bitcoin out, etc. Could you theoretically find someone who would accept your hardware wallet for some sort of trade? maybe, but you would obviously be a in tough spot and probably taken advantage of in that situation.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:31:27
damn and you were so confident it was sliding back to 8k. first august 15th, then august 22nd, then end of august? when 8k now mighty profit? you have zero idea whats going to happen. the most honest thing you've ever said is it could go to 3k, it could go to 15k, you have no idea, but what I don't understand is that If you truly believe its going to crash, why not sell at a loss and use the tax credit? you'll never have to worry about this again. but no, you'd rather come on here every day and soak up misery and downvotes with your troll comments, the same way you alternate between the mueller and the Donald trying to incite reaction and negative energy. I can't imagine what sort of misery you wake up to everyday knowing that negative interaction reddit fights are what you have to look forward to.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:26:59
the go to "TOS" line. spends hours repeatedly insulting others, but then throws this gem out. truly the lowest of the low.
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:45:53
super quality post.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:42:47
youre asking about the collapse of society as we know it, and whether our virtual currency would hold any value? if you truly think the end of times is coming, buy water and bullets, not bitcoin. looney toon
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:33:29
awfully quiet again. big shocker. but you're a real genius when it goes down 800 in a day. you piece of shit
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:39:40
hides out for months as prediction for 10k by august 15th fails. lurks in other subreddits being a miserable troll. bitcoin drops 20 percent in a single day \*shows back up on cue. "I knew it guys, I knew it was garbage, it went down like I thought". and of course, when it goes back up, youll be awfully fucking quiet again. go back to ranting about uber. he said you sold low cus you said you've lost 50 percent of you money, aka implying that you actually sold for a loss. I imagine what you were attempting to say, through your troll broken English, is that since you bought NEAR THE ALL TIME HIGH (ahahhahahahhaa) the price of bitcoin has gone down 50 percent. hey, lets wait another month and see where it is. honestly for much pain and suffering bitcoin causes you im shocked you didnt sell when it was at 12k earlier this summer.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:01:05
u/sfxnyc awfully quiet lately. when 8k?
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:10:42
did you read the article?
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:24:02
so you're predicting the total collapse of the socio economic system, and youre asking if holding a digital crypto currency would be valuable in such a case? the last thing anyone would be asking about in such a total collapse of the economic and social system would be "what's a solid investment for my now meaningless currency?"
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:33:47
not sure what you aren't comprehending. he's saying if you had taken for example the meagre amount you put in at 20k, and instead spread that amount over the course of bitcoin, say during its run up this entire year starting from 3k, or its run down from 3k to 8k, you'd have been profitable rather then when you hopped on the greedy train at 20k. but no, you chose the MUCH more productive route of just shitting on bitcoin and those that purchase it in reddit forums instead. good call!
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:36:43
this is the most desperate you've been. like legit out of the troll handbook. you know why you've been told not to start drama? because you literally go from subreddit to subreddit insulting others for their viewpoints, inciting confrontation, and being an overall insufferable person. you can't sit here for months, "predicting" 8k and telling everyone how they are stupid and you are a genius and youre always right because of your lack of emotional "attachment", and then cry TOS when people Call you out for being wrong and acting like the so called "experts" you seem to always be railing against. this dude isn't trying to "scam" you. hes pointing out if you truly believe bitcoin is going to tank hes right there wiling to purchase at the price you think it will tank to. 8k by august 15th huh?
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:35:08
youre telling the dude to dollar cost average 70 dollars?

@_date: 2019-09-25 11:34:30
even In the dream scenario bitcoin goes to 100k, in our happiest wildest reality, dollar cost averaging 70 dollars is going to make him what, a few hundred extra dollars? if you are serious about investing some money in, I do agree dca is the way to go. for 70 dollars? throw it in there and hope all of our dreams come true and bitcoin goes to 100k and you may make a 1000 dollars.
