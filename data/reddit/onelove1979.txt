Unfortunately, I hate being the one to represent the dummies
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:45:04
You guys are mean, I came to you guys, the experts bc tonight at dinner bitcoin came up and no one knew what they were talking about so I thought I’d ask, just looking to learn friend!
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:27:42
That makes way more sense
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:33:25
Glad to help ;)
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:31:41
Besides the sidebar are there any bitcoin for dummies resources you suggest?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:46:49
Thank you this is exactly what I need! And thanks for not being mean!!
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:59:38
I am! And thank you, I’m just honestly trying to learn and I came right to the lions den
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:27:20
Thank you nice person!
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:32:05
Thank you for recognizing my sincerity! I’m glad I posted too bc I’ve connected with some very smart and helpful people...I’ve been on Reddit 9 years the trolls don’t phase me, it’s to be expected! Thanks also for your suggestions!
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:55:00
To be honest most people don’t even know what a bitcoin is, to you it might be second nature but some people don’t know anything about it
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:39:41
Thank you and yes this is helpful!
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:31:26
I’m a person who doesn’t know much about bitcoin to begin with an tonight amongst other uniformed friends the subject came up and some people were under the impression that 1=1.  While I knew that was likely incorrect, Reddit is usually my go to over google because I know the folks here with “boots on the ground” in the subs could answer me quicker/clearer....
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:28:35
Nice thank you!

If it makes any difference I’m probably an old lady compared to you guys, I grew up without the internet and survived
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:39:10
In the entire process :/
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:16:35
No and that’s mean, just because I’m new to this doesn’t mean I’m completely dumb in all areas!
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:43:19
Don’t be mean Reddit friend I’m gonna delete this just thought I’d ask you guys who know a lot about it first, it’s not easy to research on google it’s a rabbit hole
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:25:45
Thank you! I have it sorted out now, I was working with incorrect information that 1usd=1 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:56:07
Wow thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:02:43
You’re absolutely right and my question was shitly worded and not thought out, forgive me
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:03:34
Guess what? I’ve *learned* since posting that dumb question! But nice try friend!
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:46:58
It’s ok, I get it :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:53:56
Geez you guys are mean! Hope you never legitimately want to learn about something and people make fun of you for starting at square one!
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:06:19
The question was completely wrong, I know that, I should have just asked for eli5 bitcoin basics not added a nonsensical unintelligent and incorrect math question! Sorry!
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:11:45
I don’t either and it was my stupid question. I was in a car with people arguing about what bitcoin even is, I wasn’t thinking
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:27:27
I guess I’m completely lost to all this it’s very confusing and overwhelming for a newcomer :(
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:31:03
Some people think that’s how it works and I posted to be certain that’s not the case so I can enlighten myself and others! Sorry I’m so “stupid”!
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:44:35
Haha! To be honest some of them were drinking and acting stupid and truly know *nothing* about it, I’m pretty sure one of the guys just made up the 1=1 and since I was crammed in the back of the car I didn’t really proofread or think the math through, and i got hanged for it in the comments, but that’s ok, I enjoy learning! I think people on this sub think most people have at least a rudimentary understanding of all things bitcoin but A LOT of people have no knowledge of it and don’t even know where to start, this post has been helpful for me nonetheless! Thanks for being kind :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:11:02
*superb and no
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:10:38
I’m a lady and thank you! I’m not new to Reddit I knew what I was getting myself into and that they’d be mean! I should have spent more time on my question, I made myself look stupid they’re just pointing it out! I have a bit of money I’d like to invest and so I’m starting at the very beginning so I can learn as much as I can before I do anything!
