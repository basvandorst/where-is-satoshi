My point is that cracking those keys is completely doable. You only need to run 8.1141499765109106e+34 raspberry Pi's (they are cheap!) for one year.

IO is very expensive, so I did a partial output every n cycles.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:30:00
I actually ran this on my RaspberryPI just now. My Pi was able to count to 34222080 in 60 seconds. 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 shouldn't be a problem.
**edit**: it would only take roughly 8.1141499765109106e+34 years.

Does that mean that I now own both BTC and BCC automatically? And in theory I could spend it on both chains?

Does it still apply after eight hours?

No worries, I have only invested the money I had reserved for her education.

Your wallet has 100 addresses already generated, so if you back up only every 100 addresses you are theoretically fine.
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:54:01
Regular backups are always a good practice.

If you lost you wallet and you have no backup, you lost your bitcoins. No technical genius can do anything about it.

We don't, but the article gives an estimate.

Very interesting to see this. The people questioning the legitimacy are the ones who don't yet understand the concept.

Note how the title says: "I bought **a** Bitcoin". That's the spirit! Next people will say: "I invested in Bitcoin, I bought 1000 Satoshi."

Hmmm. As usual I am late to the party. I'll just drink the leftovers.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:42:30
Funny how you blurred your address. The worst thing that could happen is people adding more to your funds.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:22:08
Indeed, I don't think you do.

Today, my nine years old daughter asked: "Daddy, what is bitcoin?" Because apparently she had heard me talking with my wife. I said: "Remember this moment. This is the first time you heard about the currency of the future."
... and she was totally cool with that.

Did you send it from an online wallet? Satoshidice says: "Warning. Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test with .001 Bitcoins. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible."
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:59:32
edit: made a paperwallet for her. Thank you.

The invocation of Asimov always works. Cheers again. Daughter is all excited.

Most likely on Tuesday July 16th we'll be back on 230 again and everything will be ok for you. Nothing could go wrong, really.

Before the crash there where many 0.02 bitcoin microtransactions, wasn't this the reason of the lag? The DDOS-ing began only afterwards.
@_date: 2013-02-10 09:06:51
Confirmed. No activity for at least 30 minutes. Satoshidice is also quiet as hell.
