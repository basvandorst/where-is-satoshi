Wow that’s an eye opening thought!
Think about this.... if you would have bought into bitcoin on thanksgiving at $8,200,   then today, 11 days later, you could cash out at $11,111 (about a 35% increase). 
Furthermore, if you had put in $5,000, you’d have cash out $6,750.  
But what if you thought bitcoin was too high of a price? So instead you put $5,000 in ethereum. You’d still cash out at a 22% increase.  That’s $6,100 going from a price of 380-464. 
I look forward to 10 days from now.

That is something that will be phased out though.  Rent just like your taxes in Arizona will soon be availably handled in BTC.
