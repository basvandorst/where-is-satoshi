100% of the sellers could still have sold at a profit, so it didn't hurt them, just didn't reward them as much as it could have. But sure, most sellers could also be people who just got in and started freaking out when it started dropping.

Which sites are better than coinbase? Do their exaggerated prices apply to their other currencies too?

What's better about it? Because the fees are higher and the transactions are slower, right? Or am I misinformed? I know the fees when I was going to transfer $20 was around $14, so a little more than 2/3, but I guess bitcoin is more for the big players?

I've had ETH, Ripple and LTC, so all those are much cheaper because they are centralized? Sorry to bother you with all this, I'm just trying to learn. Tell me to stop if you want to. Thank you for the replies.

Isn't bitcoin essentially one of the worst coins? Not in terms of investment there it's definitely one of the best. But the technology behind it?

I'm just getting into this so not really a secure source. But the value of 1 coin is essentially irrelevant, it's the market increase that matters. If you have 100 LTC and 1 BTC, if BTC goes up 100% and LTC just increases 0.9% you still earned more from that single BTC. What you have to do to find the market you want to invest in is to decide which one you think will have the biggest percentage growth, or invest 50/50 if you can't decide and hope they increase together or that the growth from one exceeds the decrease in the other.
