That's what I figured.  Maybe it's time to put wallet info in the will.

Would it be possible to change the software to recover these lost bitcoins? For example, to change the protocol so that if a certain coin hasn't been transferred/used in 100 years, it would be available to be mined again?  Not that I think that lost coins is really a problem mind you, but in the interest of super-long term stability... what would be the pros and cons of an idea like this?

I think it's interesting that bitcoin will have fully developed currency exchanges, stock markets, other financial instruments etc. by the time it has reached widespread adoption.  As far as I know this is unique for a currency - usually these things develop after the currency is in general circulation.  I imagine that this aspect of the community will be a net positive for its stability, but I suppose time will tell.

Perhaps not. What guarantee does romney have even if he does pay up?

Hey man, you may think I'm joking, but you can never be too careful with these people.  I've been investigated before and the IRS threatened to throw me in jail over $65 of unpaid payroll tax withholding.  This is not a joke, so don't underestimate them.  Bitcoin is pretty much under the radar right now but in a few years when this thing blows up, there may be a serious crackdown.  Take the appropriate security precautions now and get in the habit of using them.  Perhaps I'm just paranoid, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.  It's only prudent to plan for the future.

Maybe you've never been audited before? Take it from me, you are guilty until proven innocent with those people. If they catch the scent of bitcoins, it will be a witch hunt.

$1,000,000 is not serious, this is obviously a political stunt. No way romney will ever pay that.  Might have actually worked if they asked for $50-100k and kept this thing private.  But since the ransom is out on the interwebs now, the romney campaign is in a position where even if they paid this ridiculous amount (with zero guarantee that the ransomer will uphold their end, btw) they still lose face. So what's the point? Either this is a political stunt, or some deluded member of anonymous with more computer skill than common sense.

(Paraphrasing from memory)
"If this bitcoin thing really takes off, than the early adopters could become more wealthy than the Rockefellers. The most financially powerful people on the planet would be anarcho-capitalists."
Ho! Lee! Shit!

Thats true!  I mispoke there, thanks for the correction. Information can have inherent  utility, just like gold has industrial uses.

Oh snap!
