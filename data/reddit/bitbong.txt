This is getting to be a joke. When someone comes to me and says "how do we open a successful exchange", the first thing I say is "Put your damn name on the site with a legal corporation and you are already the top 5 exchanges without any volume"
This is what I get from my research: 
“HITBTC” was founded by “Ullus Corporation”. The company was incorporated in 2013 and claims to be licensed as a financial company. Operating accounts were opened in “SWED Bank” and “SEB Bank”. Swedbank AB is a Nordic-Baltic banking group offering retail banking, asset management, financial, and other services with Stockholm. The latter Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB is also a Nordic bank Its activities comprise mainly banking services, but SEB also carries out significant life insurance operations and also owns Eurocard.
Ullus Corporation's website is down (ulluscorp.com), but looking at a cached version of the site it says "The company’s headquarters, since its inception, are located in Hong-Kong" and also repeatedly talk about their Financial License, but don't say from which country.  (
This is where it get's interesting, the company also registered CatPay.com which is some sort of a Bitcoin wallet. Both domains are now under private registration and try to not be connected to each other. CatPay's customer service line is in Estonia. 
Both of those domains are owned by ulluscorp.com which has been taken down. You can easily get RAW versions of the old Whois file on the registration












































Anyways, I'll have some of my friends in Panama check out their office to see if it exists. 
**For now, STAY AWAY.**

"lying to payment processors and other BitInstant employees about the situation" They picked and chose a bunch of emails from a huge list of emails chains, Shrem said in one of his interviews. Obviously he's not commenting on any of this specifically, but there's always two sides to the story. Let's wait and see. He never scammed or stole from anyone, unlike Karpeles or Danny Brewster. 
Everyone who was around in 2011 knew 80% of Bitcoin transactions were being used for Silk Road. You should listen to this:

I agree, I wish they put Gavin, Roger, Amir, Andreas and Tony in. Everyone else didn't do much and don't deserve to be in it.

It does not work. I tried it , there's no confirmation nor redirect. There 24/7 support only works for credit card transactions. I guess I'm free fapping tonight....

Of course out of the billion emails he sent, they are gonna show the most incriminating ones. I bet they can take emails you sent to make you look incriminating to. Thats what they do.

It seems to be the biggest charge is the money laundering, The IRS-Dep't of Treasury considers Bitcoin property and most states haven't concluded if Bitcoin services are money transmission, in fact, Texas says its not and NY (where Shrem lives and operated BitInstant) is still working on the licensing for it. 
For the money laundering, your right it requires heavy legal interpretation. They are claiming that Shrem took customers funds for the **specific** (they have to prove intent) reason of drug trafficking (by the way, since when is purchasing or helping someone purchase drugs considered trafficking?). 
Meanwhile, it wasn't Shrem selling Bitcoin to SR users directly. They allege that Shrem sold Bitcoins to Faiella who then resold the Bitcoins to users who would then allegedly use those Bitcoins to bug drugs on SR. Those who used BitInstant know, that BitInstant did not sell Bitcoins, they funded your account with MtGox USD credits where you could then use the USD to purchase BTC on MtGox. 
So the chain is this: 
USD--&gt;BitInstant--&gt;MtGox USD--&gt;Failella purchase BTC--&gt; Faiella Sell BTC to customer--&gt; Customer use BTC to buy drugs.
All of this for a mere 1M USD.  
EDIT: Looked up drug trafficking: an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense." U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)." Everything is on the sell side, not the purchasing side.

Innocent until proven guilty. Complaints are completely 1 sided, they can make anyone look guilty.

It's just what the song writer and reddit decided for the title. If you search youtube "Official Bitcoin Song" everything will come up. Let the community decide which song they like best. This is why we love Bitcoin, no one tells us what to like, we decide for ourselves :) Cheers to Bitcoin!
