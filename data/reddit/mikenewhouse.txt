It can be either. The main benefit of using the bitcoin's blockchain is that is the most secured network. It might not have the features required for a business idea though so an alternative blockchain could be preferable.

This doesn't happen. The most they will do is log numbers. They will have an intern write a template saying they value your consideration on this important topic.
Its not clear what point you are trying to make. Being familiar with bitcoin is not the deciding factor for how a representative is going to act. Getting or losing money is.

You realize this belief is full of contradictions. I need to make the assumption that you believe in the theory of representative democracy. If that is the case, how do you feel it is appropriate for politicians to represent the will of a faceless demographic of people bounded by geography, while it is inappropriate for a special interest group to represent themselves with a lobby. The two methods of gaining/wielding political power are almost identical.
The whole system of privilege and power is weird and equally hate worthy.

A lot of slights can be had against us capitalist &gt; gov. types. One of them that does not apply is that we lack faith in the civilized nature of the average man. 
The principle behind gov taxation is that people won't voluntary provide for necessary services therefore they need to be coerced to provide for it.
That seems uncivilized if you believe people are able to voluntary fund and provide these services given the chance.

which bank account? My banks saving account has an interest rate well below the published inflation rate, which is well below the actual inflation rate.

Considering my parents and grand parents don't know what money is, I find this not very surprising

HAha, yea, sure

What does the fact that you are scared of toilet paper manufacturers say about you?
Clearly you believe in Democracy but you think that two toilet paper manufacturers can subvert the entire system by paying for commercials. What a shitty and fragile system you are defending!
Either people can vote like they want and you accept it, or you acknowledge what Democracy is flawed.
The state are the terrorists. The other terrorists are just state actors trying to gain control of the state.

If this is what happens when there is "good news" from the fed, I can't wait to see what happens when bad news becomes realized

There is an actual use case to compare to though. Consider international corporations that work across country lines (and thus more than 1 legal framework). They make it work without warring.

Is dust really a factor? I imagine the hardware becomes obsolete before it breaks from too much dust exposure.

good for you. fight the ridiculous frame control around Dash. The bots will lose in the end.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:14:58
Right .... so the Rothschilds who presumably control or influence all the central banks in the world want us to use a currency not controlled by the central banks.
You need to go outside.

Almost all of the services google provides has competitors. Don't really need a new snappy startup. Do some research and figure out which ones you like.

You never actually define what a bounty is.
How did you like using Powtoon? Was it easy? The animations are fantastic.

I really struggled this weekend trying to install libuntu onto flash drive. I got it to work sort of but only on gf PC. Not on Mac. I needed a special boot loader for Mac. Still haven't gotten it to work. The partioning section is not clear. Getting it on only the flash drive is where I'm stuck

What is slack?
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:54:03
no dude, you are just being a major moron. If someone mugs you of $20 bucks when you go to buy a bike tire off of craigslist you don't complain that the USD is unregulated.
Localbitcoins has a very sophisticated mechanism for protecting people in their transactions. As long as you don't deviate from it you shouldn't get scammed.

That is a pretty ridiculous way of funding when you think about it haha. I'm a big fan on nh anyway.

It is not a slight at you. You just said you finished econ and finance courses and they didn't mention it (or you weren't paying attention, that IS a slight ;) ) I find that insane.
Also, if you google QE there are 180 million results so I'm surprised this is the first you are hearing it
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:33:43
Exactly like the current institutions but you have choice in choosing which ones get involved

You are not providing any reasonable end game for "them" who want to control it in the future. 
Why on earth, would you socialize everyone in to accepting an online, decentralized currency? What would prevent people from swapping to a better option when your nightmare scenario hits? 
You reasoning seems circular and jumbled. I hope you are wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:32:28
Lol. You are joking!

Can you rewrite this? It is not clear.
