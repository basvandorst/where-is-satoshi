Your best shot would be to take it to a forensics lab if everything else here fails.

Absolutely Barbaric.

It seems you don't know what "appeal to authority" really means.


It's like listening to Stephen Hawking talk about politics because he's a "really smart physicist".

Meh, either way I'm ~~gonna buy~~ buying some.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:09:39
I'm gonna buy ~~when it drops below 800.~~ now.
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:21:41
I'll buy more.

I'm watching my .2 bitcoin I bought at 1030 drop in value in a major way.
I'm very much panic hodling.

Of course I'm a little stressed about the price dropping so quickly, but I'm not selling it because I know it always bounces back.
Which is why I'm "panic hodling". I'm not going to panic sell because I'll just lose my money. I had already made up my mind that no matter what I won't sell it, but rather buy more as it goes down.
Plus, 200 is quite a bit for a college student.

I'm new here; what does "21M club" mean?

Neither do you, but we have this comment. Then we have mine, and others as well.

As my first bitcoin, I was only able to get .2 btc when it was at $1025/btc. It's at $1159 now, but I wish I could have put more into it. :(

A middleman/escrow service would be the best bet. Ebay or some other company could hold the bitcoin for a time until both parties are satisfied with their purchase, along with a time limit, whichever comes first. So If the buyer and seller have no complaints within 30 days of the buyer receiving the package, then the btc would be available for withdrawal from their ebay account.

I think it will ATH at 12k around January 20th after dropping to around 5.5k about 20 days from now.

Yes, but it's a stable, rather predictable loss of value.


It needs to be easy enough to use in everyday transactions.

Right, just like how it went back down to 500 after it peaked at 900.
Oh, wait...

This is the biggest whoosh I've ever seen.
