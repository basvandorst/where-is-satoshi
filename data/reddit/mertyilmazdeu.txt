you got scammed by blockchain wallet ? world's most famous one ? i dont believe that at all
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:53:48
well i think you both probably were scammed by someone else that logged in your account. I have never heard of mt gox before tho

@_date: 2017-07-21 11:21:51
it was 2.919 and now 2.700 , do you think it will stay around this ?
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:18:18
why ?
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:50:06
i dont think you undestand what i mean , i have never been concerned with drops.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:40:31
I am getting e mails from wallets but its really hard for me to understand the news , those terms they use .. I'm justing looking for a simple explanation.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:34:57
yeah maybe. i have been holding my btc for a long time and made a decent profit but now i wanna buy and sell and make profit with that way.BTC hit 3k 1-2 times and went down to 1900s , these were great opportunities to make profit but i missed.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:18:10
i mean ofc i will buy again , im not leaving my love. Im just talking about the current situation.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:38:40
i have missed great times when btc went down and up too much to make profit by holding my btc. Thats what upsets me.
