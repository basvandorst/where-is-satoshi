This is the kind of thinking I'm talking about. You should speak in terms of trade-offs, use cases, and specific areas of competition. Monero can't compete against Bitcoin ...  *at what*?  Do you know the actual difference in TX size?  Currently about 5x, but will be less than 4x in 6 months.  
Does this limit scaling capacity for abundant small tx on Monero? Absolutely. But does it limit people who wish to store a portion of their value privately, away from the prying eyes of authoritarian govts and chainanalysis? Absolutely not.
Bitcoin can't compete against Monero for fungibility and privacy, *especially* for large amounts. Monero can't compete against Bitcoin for scalability.  Perhaps those statements *might* change in the future, but at this point any of that is mere speculation. Remember that gold and silver acted as tandem currencies for thousands of years, because of their unique use cases.

How do people not get sarcasm.  Did I not post something ridiculously over the top?

Theoretically new tech \*could\* be ported to Bitcoin. In reality the network hasn't had a significant upgrade since segwit. Particularly, privacy features which Andreas was so adamant about, have made very little progress towards actual integration.

Very much doubt that.  The space is bigger and harder to change code now. Many powerful people want to make sure that privacy is never implemented in the main chain. And even if in 2-3 years Schnorr does get it, it isn't nearly the privacy upgrade that it's touted anyways. 
There is one coin out there that actually obfuscates the sender, receiver, and tx amount, by default, in the base layer. It's our best chance at real privacy/fungibility right now.

There's no such thing as taint. No exchange has ever frozen anyone's BTC because of past transactions. Slow/expensive coinjoinz with LN are all you need to stay private *enough*.  Don't use any of that dirty money laundering child molester criminal coin called "Monero."
Edit: for all the idiots downvoting me, learn some fucking sarcasm.

Cool story bro. We were talking about other things... network upgrades, protocols decisions, tradeoffs, and deficiencies. Don't switch over to a nice self-reassuring dialogue about why Bitcoin is great. I know why Bitcoin is great.  For the past year and a half I've been preaching about its superiority and why bcash will die.
But don't pretend we're in amazing shape. Don't pretend like it has true fungibility and privacy. Don't pretend like we're close to being a global transactional currency and not just an alternate SoV. Don't forget that ONE corporation controls 75% of ASIC manufacturing and patents. Don't forget that certain miners and exchanges colluded to attack the network, cause delays, damage, confusion, and premature ossification of the protocol.  
And don't forget that for 1000s of years, gold *and* silver acted as tandem SoV and transactional assets. 
As good as Bitcoin is, it has certain deficiencies in key areas, *not* scalability, but privacy/fungibility.  It's clear that too many people want to prevent those upgrades. And so, keep an open mind towards Monero. It has no corporation/foundation, no leader, no marketing department, was farily launched, a huge developer base, 100% community driven, academic peer review, and the undisputed  spot in Github code upgrades and activity year over year.  
The space does have room for another legitimate monetary blockchain.  No it won't challenge Bitcoin for dominance. In fact, it can supplement Bitcoin as a sort of privacy layer, a way to swap in/out to increase your privacy on the Bitcoin network.

I love Andreas, watch almost all his vids. This one was disappointing. Instead of talking about Bitcoin upgrades and development keeping us solidly in lead, it feels like he pivoted to something more like, "It doesn't matter if another network has better tech, implementation, or solve fundamental problems where Bitcoin is lacking ... Bitcoin will always dominate caz it was first and is too big to be challenged." 
It used to be "innovate faster than they can regulate," and, "it's not a zero sum game," and general interest in the evolving tech. Is he saying this because it doesn't look like privacy or fungibility are going to get implemented at the base layer?  His point is well taken, netowrk effects are huge and count for A LOT.  Bitcoin has no real challengers, but in a space that's only 10 years old, it's too soon to be claiming an insurmountable network effect.  Even he would say we're still in the very early days here.

This is ridiculously bullish. Anecdotally, I'm seeing moms/dads/friends/fam *actually* preparing to buy their first coins, as of the past couple months.  These aren't traders.  These are going to be long term hodlers who won't sell for at least a couple years.

Try educating yourself.

This kind of thing is going to happen more and more often. Exchanges are feeling confident they have the market locked down, and just like FaceTwit, they will start with the censorship.
Should use the only coin where confidentiality is default and already functional.

Except Japan already did it.

You spelled Monero wrong
