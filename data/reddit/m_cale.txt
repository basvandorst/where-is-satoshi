Also, you should never tell anyone you are willing to sell 50btc. You are disclosing important information there and they might track you down

I don't think it's a matter of doing it in a safe area since it can happen anywhere. Policemen may be around but that doesn't mean you will have a bodyguard. I hope these articles are enough to prove you it's not safe to do it (and these are only some examples). Just don't do it ;)

"Payable in cash or crypto"

Then you will get even more bullish with groups like r/Buttcoin. Full of hate, ignorance and biased information

I'm sorry this happened to you. It's horrible they know they are scamming unexperienced/desperate people (and sometimes experienced too!). Unfortunately there is nothing you can do. Learn from the lesson and never do it again.

You are welcome! Google it and you will see. There are videos on youtube too ;)

I think the next way to pay with cryptos will be thanks to Request Network. First, the project is backed by YCombinator ( ) and second, they have partnered with PWC France.
It will make crypto more accesible through its decentralized network for payments request. Some of the use cases for Request Network are: Online payments with no third parties and its consequent lower fees; B2B invoices; Accounting and auditing; Escrow or factoring; Reputation layer (buyer and seller).
It's a long term project but with the strong team they have and their objectives I can definitely see it working :) Online cross-currency payments will be a reality soon.

Same here :) It's a revolution

Careful with the phone though. London is the phone-theft capital of the UK. Make sure you don't have any important information on your phone, encrypt it and don't take it out on the streets (they snatch it from your hands).

In regards to my comment about Req, that's something they will solve too. Plus the reputation layer will serve to what you mentioned about "reviews and rankings".

Glad you posted this. I've got my hopes up and personally think that Request Network will be big. An open, fair and accesible  financial system is just around the corner. Cross-currency payments (including BTC) will be real soon :)
