In Australia we call it superannuation, you contribute each week for retirement. I rolled my and my wife's superannuation over to a self managed fund and invested it in crypto about 5 months ago. So far my return on investment is above 400% as apposed to approximately 2% per annum. I am not allowed to withdraw the funds until retirement which is over a decade away. I'm not going to change this regardless of how the crypto market performs, at least if it fails I know I've been in control and if it performs well then I know I'm still in control. The lesson in this is I don't have to trust a third party or pay their management fees and if I want I can diversify the investment into other investments in the future.

The government. I had to get approval to roll my super into a self managed fund and notify them that I intend on putting it into cryptos. Now each year my accountant will provide the tax office with an audit of my account. Same deal if I'd purchased realestate or shares etc. if I want to withdraw any of my super early I would have to apply to the government for approval citing special circumstances etc

Eyes wide open. You've read article after article over the past year or two predicting catastrophe or huge growth so the deal is if you want in then buy and measure your success or failure using % not $. Bitcoin isn't going away any time soon so do your homework and make an informed decision cause it's not only the wealthy buying into it, everyone is either buying or selling it depending on the goals they have set or the circumstances they are in. Me personally I have bought over the last couple of years when I can afford it and regardless I'm not looking to sell until 2020 or until I'm forced to due to unforeseen circumstances. Good luck
