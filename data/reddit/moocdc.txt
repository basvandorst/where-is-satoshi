The first course of the MSc ([DFIN 511-Introduction to Digital Currencies]( is offered in the form of a free MOOC. The 4th offering is starting this Monday (September 7th) so there's still time to enroll. You can check the quality first hand, before committing to the whole MSc and find out more about the program from the students taking it themselves.
The first graduates of the MSc will be out this winter so no one has completed the whole MSc yet.
