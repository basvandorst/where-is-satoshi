firstly, i respect your incredible amount of ambition regarding the future success of bitcoin.
however, i have a few points:
the trend in the price of gold over the past 10 years isn't dissimilar to the trend in the price of bitcoin [vs. the dollar]. over the past 20 years, gold has gone from $300 [per ounce] to $1200. gold is generally seen as a *poor* investment. over the past *two* years, bitcoin has gone from $200 to $2000 dollars. were the price increase not so stark, and had bitcoin not bubbled and burst once before, i could agree with stabilization. but that's an incredibly drastic increase, and doesn't lead me to believe that some manner of stabilization is occurring.
secondly, you say that the dollar could just as equally be seen as a poor investment because of its rapid drop in value in comparison to the bitcoin. to that, we can look at the euro, another relatively stable currency, and see how both the dollar and the bitcoin fare. you can just google "dollar vs euro" and "bitcoin vs euro" yourself to see the charts google automatically provides - i'm not sure how to link them here. the dollar appears as if it's doubling in value compared to the euro over time, but that's only because the chart doesn't start at 0 - the dollar stabilizes around 0.75, then there's a bump, and it's once again stable at 0.9. whereas the bitcoin vs. the euro, it's a bit wonkier, and looks more or less the same as it does against the dollar - drastic, drastic increases.
and notice how i use the word *investment* throughout this whole reply. that's intentional.
you hear success stories about "i just sold my bitcoin and made millions!" or "i just lost my kid's college fund because i invested it in bitcoin!" my point is that bitcoin is so volatile, that it's often seen as an *investment*. no good currency is like this to the extent which bitcoin is. i mean, you *can*, but generally i don't think other currencies are your best bet for an investment. but that's besides the point - bitcoin *won't* stabilize as long as people keep seeing it as an *investment*, rather than a currency. and as long as it keeps rising and falling - and i do believe it'll fall again - people will keep buying and buying for the sake of cashing it in back to dollars and making big bucks, leaving dollars the default currency, with bitcoin behind it as a nifty side investment.
