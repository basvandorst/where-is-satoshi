Be careful with that meme, it's an antique.

Hello, new user!
I've been in the same boat you are, and it is a bit of a pain. You might try buying something for someone on Purse.io, although I'm not sure how many offers will pop up for such a small amount. Alternatively, perhaps set up an advertisement on LocalBitcoins.com? You'd probably need to use the whole card though, and you would need the receipt most likely. Buying Bitcoin with a credit/debit/prepaid card is a difficult process, since credit card purchases can be reversed, so the Bitcoin seller would be out of luck in a scam. Purse would probably be your best bet. 
Anyway, welcome to the land of Magic Internet Money! Please enjoy your stay.

PrizeRebel offers Bitcoin rewards through Snapcard. I think Perk.tv offers them too, but it was a long while ago, so I can't be sure.

Bitcoin has died [many times now.]( And yet it lives on. Like the majestic cockroach, nothing can truly kill it.

It feels *amazing*.

Hmm. Interesting. I'll consider them. Thanks!
Edit: So, upon further examination, this seems to be a way to purchase Bitcoins.
Which is useful, but it requires a wallet address to buy them. Where would I go to create
the wallet? Could I use Coinbase, and just buy them on bitquick? Is there a wallet section I am missing on bitquick?  I've seen the wallet section on the website, but I'm paranoid of choosing the wrong one, and being unable to change it later.

Yeah. Fees of a cent or 2, as opposed to a few dollars. And no central company watching my transactions. Always nice!

No worries. I decided on Electrum for my wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:17:22
Heh. I never thought about that, but you're right! That's neat. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:50:35
Oh, yeah. I intend to use it much more in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:44:14
Of course. Still, that's a very useful thing to know of. Thank you!

Well, for an Electrum wallet, you could type the seed into a text file, encrypt it with a really good password, and then put that on Google Drive.
