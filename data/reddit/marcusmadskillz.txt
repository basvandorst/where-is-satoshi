thanks! People talk past each other a lot when they don't have all the info, this bridged a gap. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:44:36
I think is4k below answered my question. You still need some kind of plugin if you're a merchant (duh, I should have realized that) but...they're out there already....

Must have been taken down since I posted the link. Sorry :&lt;

+1. Go on. About the bridges.

Well, that one stuck out. But actually I was hoping people would examine the author's arguments re merchant acceptance costs. Bitcoin addresses are free, so should he really be incredulous that merchants could be "somehow magically and freely hooked into the bitcoin network"? And if you're using a processor like BitPay to immediately convert, the fee's +/- 1%, right? So what am I missing?

Beat me to it! Damn :p

Yep. Here:  and here:

FWIW Timothy Lee used to work at Cato, and his perspective, from what I've gathered from his writing, is more like, say, Andy Greenberg's than Ezra Klein's. (Lee also has a PhD in computer science I think)

...but in practice, anti-money laundering and KYC rules require logging of everyone's transactions. Last year I paid a bill for about $100 at MoneyGram. I had an invoice number for the biller. Yet MoneyGram required me to give my name and address. The biller didn't need it, they knew from the invoice # which bill it was for. Why do I have to have my personal info floating around in yet another database accessible to Lord-knows-who...just to make a lousy $100 payment? Why is it presumed that if I want privacy I **must** have something to hide?

Another legal question: Does the bank face liability for accepting at face value Mt Gox's "no" answer? (Notice how I do NOT say "should." No judgments.)  
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:24:47
On page 6 it talks of a 50 minute confirmation time. I thought average was 20 or 10. Can someone provide a refresher for a semi-noob? 
@_date: 2013-05-14 11:45:02
Sorry for late reply. I meant solution to price volatility for the consumer who buys BTC because s/he wants to buy stuff with BTC. Aside from "counting on merchants to constantly adjust their BTC prices." Though I admit a lot of them seem to be good about that. ... The ignorance is a more macro problem.

Requiring MINERS to "know your customer" -- aside from the undermining of privacy for users, is this even possible????

I suspect that Aaron has nothing personal against Bitcoin businesses, he just sues a lot. I think he's trying to make a point about selective enforcement with that suit... but yeah not a great strategy for making friends. He is clearly a bright and inventive young man, I bet he will grow wiser and go on to eventually accomplish something truly great in the tech sphere. But maybe in a less regulated business than financial services :)

...and at what cost to the rest of us who use the financial system? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:28:25
Might Mt. Gox have plausible deniability since the "smoking gun" (5/20/11) predates the "clarifying" Fincen guidelines (3/18/2013)? I ain't passed the bar. Discuss. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:37:10
Good point on first. On second, Which WU form? Can't find in story or the warrant itself

Well, if he banked at HSBC he'd get first-class treatment (I kid, I kid)

First they came for InTrade, and I didn't speak out because I didn't use InTrade... (sorry, I know it's tasteless but I couldn't resist)

Stupid question from a noob: Was this publishing of user info accidental buffoonery or would there be a strategic business reason to do so? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:29:18
Sorry, meant to include link to said guidelines  Date of smoking gun is in the arstechnica article

"Money laundering helps terrible things happen: human trafficking, child pornography, terrorism, etc." -- Can the same not be said of encrypted emails,  the anonymizing Tor browser, untapped phones, shutters on windows, tinted car windows, bathrooms not equipped with webcams? Should these things be banned?   
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:20:45
"Potentially" is an important qualifier. But then that gets into bigger questions about AML/KYC :)  
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:24:12
Well, it's an op-ed....
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:22:53
The gov't couldn't give MtGox a warning? Or even a fine and "don't do that again"? Oh wait I forgot, we're talking about Mt Gox, not HSBC. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:14:22
Bitcoin is so fast and frictionless, but getting your $ in and out... :) 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:42:22
Told you I'm not a lawyer! :) Thanks
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:08:40
How so?

"privacy without anonymity" -- thots? 
@_date: 2013-09-04 17:27:21
(Apologies in advance for all-caps shouting, but I feel it's necessary): Not everyone wants anonymity ALL THE TIME. But many (perhaps most people, if they thought about it) would surely prefer the OPTION of anonymity for SOME PURCHASES. They may be willing to make TRADE-OFFS in exchange for said anonymity -- like the risk (from the consumer's pov) inherent in an irreversible transaction. Different digital payment methods can and should coexist to suit the differing needs of the diverse human race. The world don't move to the beat of just one drum...  
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:09:58
"Phase 1: underpants..." 
I kid, I kid. 
Graphic makes a fair point: Firms like BitPay, Coinbase and Paymium can manage the currency risk for merchants, which helps make BTC more viable as a means of exchange...
Now ... what's the solution for the Average Joe users?   
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:55:47
Ah, generic MSB form. Gotcha.
