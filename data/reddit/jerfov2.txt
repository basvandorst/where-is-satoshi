If you've got a problem with crime, that's fine, but you're trying to use it as an argument against Bitcoin. Criminals, like any other person wanting to make money, will buy something that they think will appreciate in value. Bitcoin has a 230+ BILLION dollar market cap. Do you think all of that is criminal activity?

For the first paragraph, that can apply to any asset, not just bitcoin. Maybe you think Bitcoin’s not worth 14K. Short the futures, sell your coin, whatever. Things have value because people place value on them.
As for your second paragraph, I agree that Bitcoin doesn’t have any guaranteed value, it does have a “floor”. If SHA-256 hashes we’re somehow broken, BTC value would go to 0. But because of its unique properties and the existing network around it, Bitcoin has some value, and I don’t think that’s going to disappear for a while. If it does, it’ll be by another crypto.

Power companies, probably


Why would it be free? It's a service just like any other that has a cost because it is valuable and takes resources to maintain. 


The government, probably. I don't know why people keep talking over illegal activity with Bitcoin, because people can use fiat for illegal activity. Not legally, of course.


What did this even mean? No?


What? No one.


I guess it'd be a good thing to have laws and power grids...


What does this mean?


Bitcoin gives you the responsibility over your own money. It is not controlled by any one entity, thus cannot be artificially inflated. It decentralizes and (somewhat) anonymizes peer to peer transactions. I don't know what Bitcoin is stressing besides Wall Street. 


This is an actual good point (Even if it has been asked 82527842462 times before). If you look at Bitcoin as a currency, this is a bad design decision. Most economists would agree that a stable, predictable, low level of inflation (approximately equal to growth of the whole economy) is a healthy thing. But if you look at Bitcoin as a store of value, or a commodity, such as gold, a 21000000 cap makes sense. 


Like it's been said before, silver does not devalue gold. Likewise, creating cryptocurrencies does not devalue existing currencies (unless users choose to sell their old for the new). I could create my own coin right now, called JerfoCoin. You know how much affect that would have on bitcoin? ZERO. With fiat, however, the government can print more of the same thing at their own whim. 


Not by you, obviously.


Bitcoin isn't trying to piggy back off of anything, it's separating itself from conventional money. 


When you come up with a better currency, please tell us.


I guess    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯? Happy New Year!

Bitcoin is many ways is MORE traceable than the US dollar because every transaction is publicly available on the blockchain or even better identification on exchanges. There are ways to somewhat obfuscate your transactions, but everyday the government is finding ways to track people through the blockchain. This is one of my biggest issues with Bitcoin: not enough privacy.

Competition creates innovation, which in turn creates resources. When you don't have competition, you get monopolies and poverty, with a disappearing middle class.

What do you mean by this? Can you explain? 


Criminals want to make money. They could just as well use stocks to generate income. That doesn't mean we should ban stocks because criminals make money off of them


Correction: You have to sell to get another currency out of it, you could say Bitcoin is a form of money already. And if you're trying to argue that money launderers want to get money, I'm not going to argue with you. But what's the point you're trying to make against Bitcoin?

They're talking about full nodes, not miners. There's a huge difference

If you want to make a profit, try mining other coins with lower difficulty then converting to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:17:55
First Paragraph: Yes because they would get more money, but that's normal. Users will pay higher transaction fees to get their transactions through faster; Law of Supply and Demand. This isn't from miners artificially inflating the transactions fee, it's because there's only so much block size to go around and a lot of people want to use it. 
Second: Theoretically this could happen, if EVERY miner in the world agreed to inflate the fees, but if not every miner agreed to do it, then the miners sending artificially high-fee transactions would suffer a net loss, making it unprofitable. The mining community is so diverse and decentralized that I don't think it's an issue, at least for right now.
I hope this helped!
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:54:09
Not gonna lie, I don’t think the lowest circulating supply means anything. Does that mean the optimal supply is 1? I could create my own currency with a lower circulating supply, but it won’t be worth anything. I don’t see what Mcafee is saying here 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:44:30
I agree if that’s what the algorithms for the wallets are doing, but I don’t think they’re looking at the size of the mempool, they’re looking at the fees that just got mined and pricing accordingly

Another arbitrary bitcoin price prediction, brought to you by some random guy you don’t know 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:55:14
No because for them to drive up transaction fees, they’d have three options: Spam transactions with small fees, broadcast transactions with high fees or self mine the high-fee transaction. If they spam small fee transactions, they won’t get mined. If they broadcast high fee transactions, they lose the fee amount. If they self mine, they lose out on the transaction fees from other’s transactions. Either way, it is less profitable for the miners to try and rig the system that way, which is what Satoshi planned.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:16:17
What’s a SaNat lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:18:18
First Point: No because they wouldn't matter because they wouldn't get mined, they'd just take up space in the mempool maybe.
Second: think about it, if miners send .1 BTC transaction fees each, every miner receive AT MOST .1BTC. But there always will be miners that don't send .1BTC fee transactions. So it would be the most profitable to send the LOWEST fee possible to get their transactions through. The rewards of a block in a pool are distributed proportionally to hashes submitted, minus the operator fee. Also, the "creation" of blocks IS decentralized.

 Guessing here, but I think Core wanted to model Bitcoin off of gold, of which there is only a certain amount in the world. Gold doesn’t inflate (not a lot anyways), but doesn’t pay dividends like a POS coin would. Idk

What are you talking about "until it got taken over"? You mean more people use it now?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:07:04
Buying a mining rig increases liquidity by definition, because you are making a transaction. POS gives you more of a say if you hoard coin for longer, which decreases liquidity long term because people won’t want to move their coin

This question has never been asked before
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:19:41
I think you mean inflationary. Bitcoin is deflationary because the supply is capped. But there is a difference between POS and hodling Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you might not want to sell Bitcoin because the value per coin is increasing. With a POS coin, you don’t want to sell because you get advantages directly for not transacting. The reasons for each are value vs arbitrary rule 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:56:22
You should search for the dozens of times this same question has already been asked 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:33:23
I'm not sure I understand. We will still have to mine once all the coins have been mined, but you be working solely for the transaction fees
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:28:28
But that’s not necessarily true with Bitcoin. Just because of the way it’s exploding right now, it’s better to hodl. However, with POS, it pays to not liquidate the currency, with makes it bad for markets and bad for everyday use 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:27:24
In energy efficiency maybe, in decentralization, definitely not; Rich banks would get more of a say in the system. Also POS comes with economic drawbacks. For example, POS penalizes you for transacting. That’s not the kind of thing you want for a currency or store of value. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:33:56
People are allowed to have other ideas, you know. Also, many of the technologies implemented in other coins would require a complete upheaval of the Bitcoin protocol.

Just like with any "real" purchase w/ Bitcoin there needs to be some trust with the party that you're dealing. Likewise, with loans right now, there needs to be some legal contract. So loaning in Bitcoin would be just like loaning with a fiat currency imo, but a little harder to "force" the loanee to pay Bitcoin than a fiat currency. Disclaimer: I'm no economist

There's a hard fork (Bitcoin Gold) in 3 days and another (Segwit2x) on November 18th. Gold shouldn't be much of a problem, but the outcome of segwit2x is pretty hazy right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:32:24
No one knows for sure what is going to happen on November 18th. If they say they do, they're lying. I wouldn't trade Bitcoin for a while after the fork, because it is super risky due to volatility and lack of replay protection from Segwit2x

They’re not though. There are Stock derivatives, but stocks themselves aren’t derivatives. ETFs are derivatives, but I wouldn’t call them a total scam; they allow people to trade the underlying asset without dealing in it directly.
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:22:27
You can’t, otherwise the price would be 0.  If anything you should do some research because you didn’t know the difference between a stock and a derivative. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:25:59
You can’t sell it indefinitely. When you short something, an exchange or other entity keeps track of your position, and won’t let you sell past a certain percent of your margin.
I trust banks a little bit, which is generally a good thing for the economy. The economy thrives when people trust each and are optimistic because they are more willing to make transactions.
