What a fucking idiotic sociopath.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:36:12
I thought Bitcoin going mainstream was going to help it, but it seems to have just damaged it. The only thing that props it up these days is a good old fork
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:50:09
How is Bitcoin not a digital currency? What a load of shit this is
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:39:45
Oh yea of course. Ha
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:04:11
Doesn’t matter how it’s being used, it is officially a cryptocurrency. It’s used to buy many, many more things than your shitty Bcash pump and dump scheme that you so blatantly support. Sick of crap fud like this coming on here all of the time

Thanks everyone! All really interesting answers!
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:08:19
Thanks for such a great write up! How This hasn’t got more upvotes I don’t know.
What are the steps you recommend people take on this? I thought I got it all but have hit a few hurdles. Should people take everything out of Bitfinex to another exchange? And are you saying other exchanges when selling crypto actually receive USDT and not USD? Is that why withdrawals take so long?
And why would the price of BTC rise because of all of this? I got confused at this the most.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:50:35
Thanks. I actually did do CPFP with electrum but didn’t know I could with Ledger. I’ll read your guide.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:07
Thanks. Let’s say I accidentally did a stupidly cheap price (I really did - I much prefer paying higher fees for faster transaction - normally $6-8 but this time I paid less (42 cents)
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:17
Which exchange are the order walls?
@_date: 2019-07-12 21:24:51
I mean are more unique people buying bitcoin or is this USDT/wash trading/price manipulation? I know you can’t see who is buying, but I’m scared this might be boys and manipulation.
I don’t see many news stories on mainstream media about Bitcoin being back.

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:14:54
Couldn't agree more to all of this
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:57
I sincerely hope so. Honestly, I’m lost for words on how angry this makes me
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:49
What?! Coinbase can share their announcement in advance with friends for example.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:17:30
Thanks for the info. That makes more sense
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:13
Just a bump at this as I have had zero contact from Ledger and no advice is working or can apply to me! I'd be so grateful for any more help!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:06
We have no doubt 100 more people bought some Bitcoin because of it ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:23
Waiting for the dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:41
This isn't quite the same as pure chance gambling in a casino though is it. Terrible to put that here
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:27:21
Oh god sounds like mine will be three days too!
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:48:46
Do exchanges such as CEX pretend that they are using USD (and label it USD) but in fact use USDT?
Also I thought USDT will always equate to 1 USD? I’m confused how it could be worth 0.1?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:10:00
Thank you for the info. It’s 15.256 satoshi. Although I’m confused what to do from there on the site. I don’t understand the graphs. Could you make an estimated guess for me?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:51
I'm exactly the same - 0 confirmations, - everything. 72 hours is so long. It should come back quicker so that we can pay a higher fee.
Yes I hear you do get it all back. No way will it be lost forever
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:48
I heard though it's after 3 weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:32
Still 0 confirmations. How long until it gets returned to me? Infuriated that I haven’t had any movement on this since Thursday!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:54:49


I've actually already read this. None of these steps work for me. I use a Ledger Nano which doesnt have CPFP either
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:09
Got it
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:15:12
Noticed tons 20 btc sell orders on CEX too. What gives?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:03:32
Damn. I really want this cleared before Sunday!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:31:06
Upvoting this essential shit
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:36
I saw that, but the announcement was 5 hours ago. And I can’t see any sell walls coming up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:22
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:29
I was looking at that - is there a way of finding my transaction in the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:22:03
At an early stage
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:40:03
Loved your post!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:11:10
Thanks both of you - good to know. Yes I've been waiting nearly 12 hours already. Slowest I've had for me!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:48
But you’re saying they’ll all dip!?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:22
Another idea - is there any way of just cancelling the transaction so it goes back to my Ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:39
I sadly think this subreddit has been ruined by memes, people posting what the price is, people posting news posted a thousand times already, and people not searching for answers and so spamming. Such a shame
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:04:48
Great point
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:33
Yes - Hodlmoon!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:19:04
Yup! Been since Thursday. Chose high fees and it sent low
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:17:36
I’m in exactly the same boat
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:27:08
What are the ways? I actually have an important transaction that I need to get dropped or paid to speed ups. Can’t tell which sites are the scam ones though
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:20:32
What makes you think so?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:50:21
Do exchanges such as CEX pretend that they are using USD (and label it USD) but in fact use USDT?
Also I thought USDT will always equate to 1 USD? I’m confused how it could be worth 0.1?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:59:26
Can you really blame bitcoin? Surely it’s the hackers and your brothers decision on when he sold which are to blame?
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:44:56
Absolutely not. She is terrible too. I want Bernie!
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:39:18
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:22:27
Not in your country 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:59:18
No, you’d wait for a slower dip than that. That was way too fast and it’s dangerous to recommend people to sell during such speed
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:59:13
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:25:11
I actually wondered this the other day and would like to know!
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:52
What time you going to get the popcorn out?!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:33:22
Fair points everyone!
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:54:45
But let’s say you want to day trade - how can you if everything is stored in a wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:53:59
I just don’t get - is it (in a way I don’t understand), to stop the price going don’t anymore? But because the same trades are being bought from the sell, the price stays the same. So is it to encourage others to bid above the rest?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:46:04
Based in PVD!
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:05:20
Also curious to know
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:16
No it was not. Move on with your shrilling!
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:25:21
I’ve held back a bit of FIAT so we’ll see
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:26:25
Yes that’s exactly what’s happening. Could you DM me a link to the forum?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:50:55
You’re right
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:53:09
Exactly, that’s what I mean. And do you think hackers are waiting for an amount to get higher or just go in and swoop whatever they want from whoever?
I still don’t think I understand how people safely sell highs and buy lows whilst keeping their money on the exchange...
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:01:28
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:02:52
So, serious advice - it’s gone a bit down now - but shall I wait a few days before buying then?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:38:33
Quoted from a post by anon515 3 months ago:
"It's important to understand the difference between speculation and usage demand.
Under normal circumstances, Bitcoin rises simply due to usage demand. Since supply is limited, and people use Bitcoin as a store of long-term value, the price rises. And, as Bitcoin becomes a better means of transaction (either legal or illegal), the price rises. These are healthy, normal rises in value simply due to the fact that Bitcoin is precious and rare.
However, there are less healthy rises where Bitcoin simply goes up because people think it is going up. This is speculation. The problem with speculative bubbles is that they are not backed by real usage, other than people's emotions, hunches, and gut-feelings. These are actually kind of worthless.
And so, eventually the tide changes - which usually happens when the rise starts to stall, and fear takes over. And as fear creates more fear, money starts to leave -- and the price is corrected back to the normal level. Usually it corrects back to a level BELOW the normal level.
And so, it swings.
But regardless of the swings, if you're a long-term holder, and you avoid trading with emotions, and you ignore the noise, then you can do fine. Don't let fear or greed take over your actions. Trust that Bitcoin is secure, and that it's value will continue to rise as long as world governments continue to waste the wealth of world nations."
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:02:09
I’m confused what you mean here. If you think $12m is about to be sold at that point, surely you’d sell too at that point?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:51:41
Stop being an idiot and scaring people into selling. It’s not a dip
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:51:10
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:24:28
Damn, I just bought back in now at 8205!
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:49:23
You reckon that many people are going to do that? Mind blown
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:19:37
Thanks! Any idea on the id for Matrix? Couldn’t  find anything 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:28:00
You sure it’s not just some idiots wash reading and whales buying and selling big amounts? 
What news do you think will cause a dip?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:35:24
Huh? It’s 8:30 am in parts of Asia
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:39:23
Thank goodness I just did this! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:38:14


Thank you so much. I got it working. Does this look like I got hacked though? I've never logged in do BTG before but I look at the transaction history and this happened: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:30:37
No worries
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:27:25
Yes, definitely
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:58:47
What’s the wall on? I can’t see it
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:59:11
Same here. Since yesterday
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:02:52
Good points! Thanks for your thoughts!
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:38:09
Thanks - will find!
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:20:02
Here we go
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:59
This couldn’t be any more obvious that he’s from /btc. Are you being paid to come here and write this crap!?
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:03:29
Tell me more about that - check the order books
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:54:55
Thanks. Any accounts in particular?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:57:23
Honestly, I feel like this is just to clog up the order book so that you don’t know what real orders are in there. All I feel it’s doing is keeping the currency as a stable value and slowly trying to push it up. Or am I misunderstanding?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:18:29
Yup. As soon as this all turns around back to BTC I'll be returning
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:33:10
Sorry mate, you should calm down. I’m totally fine. I’m having fun speculating and asking for advice. If it plummets to $5k I’ll hodl and buy a load more.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:21:00
Great point!
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:02:10
I think you’re wrong - better have a look now...
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:46:33
I love BTC. Just reporting the inevitable pump 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:51:05
I hear ya. Hurry. Uuuuup.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:26:17
I’m sorry?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:57:22
Could you PM me any recommendation on them please? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:35:54
How does it affect BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:33:31
Another one at 6999 as well
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:26:55
Thank you very much!

@_date: 2017-09-27 00:46:00
Curious too for other people’s thoughts
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:48:49
This happened to me too
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:36:24
