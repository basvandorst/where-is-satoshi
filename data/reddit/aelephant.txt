Private or home schooling could provide a better education than public education.  
  
Police murder innocent people on the regular; enforce victimless laws like the war on drugs. We would probably be better off with private security. At least corporations don't give a shit what plants you put in your body.  
  
How about having firefighters crowdfunded by the local community? You sign a contract when you move into the neighborhood that you'll pay a certain percentage into a pool, if your house catches on fire, you have signed up for fire fighting service via that contract.  
  
Laws and regulations -- we have way too many. We would be much better off with far less. Look up polycentric law and common law.

Many people believe that Satoshi Nakamoto was likely a group of individuals rather than one person. Perhaps Hal Finney plus Nick Szabo plus someone else? If Hal Finney was "part of" SN and passed away, it would explain why SN's coins have not moved in many years.  
  
Either way, Hal was there from the very beginning and must have contributed tremendously with his expertise. Sad we lost him, glad he was in such a good state mentally. Can't imagine dealing with something like ALS.

The teller at 7-Eleven &amp; the bartender at your local dive are probably guilty of money laundering on an almost daily basis.  
Say Joe gets $20 by selling a chicken &amp; $20 by selling some illegal plants. He puts both $20 bills in his pocket. Later that day, he gets thirsty &amp; reaches for some cash. He himself might not even know which is the "dirty" money &amp; which is the "clean" money... how the hell is the teller or the bartender supposed to know?

This is the way they do it in China too. It is actually logically impossible to not violate some law, because there will be conflicting laws on the books that tell you you must do A &amp; that it is illegal to do A. When you do A or don't do A, then they come to you and try to extort you for money. If you don't pay, you disappear.

The idea that more money changing hands is an indication of a "healthy economy" is a fallacy.

Wealth is what is really important, what work is actually being done &amp; what valuable products are actually being created.

I've found this to typically be a linguistic argument. You'll say a crime is whatever is against the law; since the government makes the laws, they will always make their own actions legal. We do have international law though, &amp; the top figures in US government regularly violate it &amp; commit war crimes.
