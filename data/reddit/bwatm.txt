There are escrow systems available for cases where you aren't sure if you can trust someone to deliver.

How long does the bank transfer take? Is it business days only?

Mining is fairly expensive... what is the incentive to do so once there are no more BTC to be made? I mean, where is the computing power to validate transactions going to come from?

Deleted previous reply of: Too cool! Thank you for that. This is fascinating.
Because I wanted to add a question. If one had oodles of cash to play with, couldn't they also add in the difference in exchange rates of non-BTC, aka "normal" money? The last cost of one BTC, for example, on Mt. Gox EUR was 13.2EUR (no clue how to make that symbol) while the last trade on the US Mt. Gox was $17.55...  
13.2EUR is currently worth $17.76. One buys, say 10BTC, on Mt. Gox EUR for 132EUR. They convert this over to USD: 132EUR = $177.69. They sell their 10BTC on the US Mt. Gox for $175.55 and have now made $2.14 profit purely from the foreign exchange rate difference.
So that's, what, like a 2% profit or so? (Assuming there's no exchange fee to convert from euro to dollar.)
Okay, I'll stop there. This was more of a brain exercise for me than anything else ;) I used to play in stocks a little (never had a ton of spare money, and I say "play" because it was mostly for recreation, like gambling, than having high hopes I'd make a ton), and now there's BTC.

Cool, thanks for the reply. So most miners don't require transaction fees now, but likely will in the future? And mining can still be profitable even after no more BTC can be created? Eventually, any time one uses their BTC, they will have to pay a transaction fee?

Briliant!
