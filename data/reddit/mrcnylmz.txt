Update: On December 20, via someone who reached out after seeing this post; my deposit is in CEX now. I should note that someone was not CEX affiliated

Enpara üzerinden transfer yaptım zaten. Fakat yine de çok yüksek fee olduğu için bu yöne gittim. Artık kredi kartı dışında işlem yapmayı planlamıyorum.

I've been actively trying to contact them, with mail and twitter. They seem to be ignoring my messages all the time.
Only response I get is, it can get up to 14 banking days till transaction takes place, which is a dependent situation on my bank. And my bank claims the transfer has already taken place with no problem.
Another thing: Cex is one of the precious exchanges we can transfer money from Turkey, so the fees are burdens we should accept and move along:)

So the 14th banking day has ended and the funds are still not in my account.

Unfortunately, my deposit is still pending, with no communication from CEX side.

Generally Turkish exchanges are 6-7% higher than what the current exchange rates predicts them to be:D:D Since people find it hard to transfer money out and into the country relatively hard; prices change with a small lag.

So even Cex.io contacted me with their verified Reddit account, there isn't any news about my deposit.
