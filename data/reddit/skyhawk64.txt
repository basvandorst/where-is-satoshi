The sun will rise for most and Bitcoins value/price will increase. DCG will hold their biggest party yet and Barry and Jeff will shake hands a lot. Everyone gets Segwit albeit it now comes with a looming HF within months, 2x. Bitcoin may or may not split in two. Popcorn may or may not help you. Investors eh. Smh.

It's NOT BITCOIN though.Looks like an alt-coin kick starter. Give us all your info and worthless tokens can be yours, is all I hear.

Dear Grandparents.. They who hold the private key, hold the BTC. Without sole possession of this key, Bitcoiners risk losing it anyway.
Remember the dayz when the old trading posts existed..  known also as exchange houses where you'd go to *swap* goods and services? Would you have stored your wealth there and given them the master key?  Coinbase is a trading post and should never be used as a place for storing BTC.
The real question is 'what will Coinbase do with their Bitcoin in the future?'  And the answer is.. 'whatever they like'. 
Never mind what a hard fork is, because technically speaking, you don't own any Bitcoin.

What gives *BTC* its value is its un-pre-mined and finite supply, its uncounterfeitable state, security via a globally distributed consensus, mobility and history.

You need to state where and how your coins are currently stored, for an explanation.

Goosebumps all over.  In approx one hour it'll be Aug 1st here in Aussieland (we get it first!) and I have a tissue bet on.  There's been so many wild times in Bitcoin over the past seven years for me, but this time is extra special ;) 
Edit: Mark BTC 11:06pm AEST @ $3,507.00AUD Average.

I would have sold one of my fingers before selling any of my Bitcoin prior to Aug 8th.  The equivalent number of BCC is coming my way simply due to correct hodling. Sorry for your loss.
