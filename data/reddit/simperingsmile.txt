Yep! Whales will create a big rally in bear market, but it wouldn't help to mantain a lasting-increase bullish market, the bearish market will come sooner or later.

Actually, I am not quite sure why whould this cause a rally, but after studying the timeline of rally and big deals, it did was consistant. See [btc price]( here and the red-marked [news flash]( about bitcoin(but it is chinese). At my point, it is another fake bullish market controlled by whales. So just be careful about investment, pay insistant attention to the news. Good luck though,.

 [*Bitcoin market*]( condition is on the way to change. Price rebound islikely to occur.*
Bitcoin started to rebound slightly in the early hours of the morning, and the closing price was still above $6,400, indicating that Bitcoin was slowly stabilizing at this stage. At least people don’t have to worry about a fall happens again after the rally.
With the completion of a small correction yesterday, various technical indicators are urging the change of market condition, even if it is on the sideways market, it will not last long.
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:35:09
Yep, the rally has been already triggered. It may be bullish  for a while. 
Again, I do not want to encourage any one to invest money in Bitcoin. Just take a deep thought before investment.

Yeah, maybe you are right, I just read this info in the morning, and I assume that it may help a little learning the condition of Bitcoin market. Well then I shared them in here.

if you are a long-term coin holder, down and up mean little to u!
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:56:47
Considering the prices of crypto coins are so fluctuated, thousands dollars increase or decrease happen frequently. E.g. the peak of [Bitcoin price]( in the late 2017 was nearly $20k, and had plummeted down to $6k in June this year. Any great force enter into this field will trigger the big rally in the market and vice versus. So my thought is, blockchain is inherently money related. This is the consensus among the practitioners of blockchain industries.

I posted this pic, cuz I hope we can rethink the defination of Bitcoin. Some of Jamie's remarks are extreme though, but they did reflect some of issues at the current situation.
Most of people don't give a shit about Bitcoin's  functions, see it as a gold miner for digging money. But there must be many losers while others gain profits. I think the second point of Jamie is right, There are already many fraudsters to scam money and hackers to draw money. Some use it as a hype to rise money.
The value of Bitcoin is up to the value of decentrailized products and basically irrelevant to the tradictional currency. Many short-sighted investors have been committed to the sale of encrypted currency assets, and some days people will cry for the collapse of the whole encrypted markets.

If u bought upon 10,000 USD, such ur fancy bubble dream is understandable. If you didn't buy any of it, just don't buy any unless u are fucking rich.
Besides, the statistics isnt correct, the lowest price of this month is below 6,000 USD, no thanks:)

Watch ur Language plz. In blockchain, at least we can reach a consensus, it doesn't mean we trust each other for everything. Try to use ur dense square brain to image, if one earns $1000000000000000000000000000, and he doesn't want to pay taxes, and now everyone mission is to say yes or no, will you say yes? (oh u would I bet, u dumb ass).I believe the majority of people would say no！The trust is based on the common profits, not every stupid casual thing, not like "u want to shit and u don't trust ur sidekick cuz u think u will get sodomized by them".

couldn't agree with you more, the original purpose of the inception of bitcoin has been distorted totally. It meant to optimize and reform the currency usage system. The underlying system ---- blockchain should be applied to innovate many industrial operations, but now it seems like an economic hype to blind people to invest and speculate, even many fraudsters take the advantage to issuing cryptocurrencies in an attempt to scam money. 
What's worst, people don't fucking care about other facets but the prices, just like you said. They compare the price with other cryptocurrencies and fiat money, and that couldn't make a little help to make people understand Bitcoin in nature.
Apparently, the current trend of Bitcoin has disappointed some experts. One left those words as follow:
(1) This is the last time I talk about Bitcoin.
(2) Bitcoin is “a great product” if you are a criminal.
(3) Governments like to control their economies, currencies.
(4) Governments are going to crush bitcoin one day.
(5) “Who cares about bitcoin”.
(6) People who purchase bitcoin are stupid.
(7) I don’t understand the value of something without value.
(8) I could care less about. 
Although some of his remarks are extreme, it did reflect the issues of the situation. Just please rethinking the definition of cryptocurrency, don’t be blinded by the trend. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:03:53
Couldn't agree with u more. I am not good at economy or finance, but I quite sure the value of Bitcoin is't the accompanying price. Now the whole crypto market just fell into a sick circumstance that people are nuts to invest Bitcoin or other altcoins. People are not giving up cuz they have seen the price of Bitcoin rising from zero to above $19K and have once tried this pizza. Actually I think the price is totally controlled by some kind of power, and their are many trustees right there adjust the market value. I can tell 99&amp; of those investors lost their money since they started the investment in crypto market. Jamie, the CEO of JPMorgan once said, I don't understand the value of something without value. The price of Bitcoin is just a hype to lure more people into this crypto market. Oh, maybe u saw some gov or banks support cryptocurrencies trade-offs now, and u think the cryptocurrencies value more? I don't think is related at all. The purpose of encouraging industries to support crypto trade-off is to develop and rearch the underlying tech "Blockchain" and this what the value should be placed on.
As I wrote this commend, the [current btc price]( is $6198, jumping 4.68 percent. Now many people believe the price rides on a bull, hope as u wish.

What I meant was there are many cases attempt(first attempt is Cryptokitties) to use blockchain tech, not compliant at launch yet. Before mutually combine with this new tech, has to be a long way to go. For instance, if game industry apply blockchain(actually there are cases, like Tencent new game:Let’s Hunt Monsters), it allows game data to be distributed and stored in different parts of world. Players from all over the world can log in the game without geographical restrictions. But the biggest problem is how to minimize the data transmission time and avoid package dropping.

Dont think so, decentralized storage mechanism is just the way to realize decentralized consensus which is one of great features of blockchain(or u can say is of Bitcoin,Blockchain is just the underlying technology) . And now this storage mechanism is applied to many industries to bring top-norch efficiency in information sharing.
