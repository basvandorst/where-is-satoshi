sold half my shares just now so we'll see what happens. This is definitely a bubble, it's just a matter of how high it goes until it bursts. I'm long on bitcoin for the long term but would like a cheaper entry point, especially with the GBTC premium and futures market being launched next week.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:03:42
I sold about half my position but held the rest and bought more on Monday so I'm up about 40% this week on mondays investment and 250% in two months on the original. This is through the GBTC ETF though so I'm paying a premium.

Don't get me wrong...I really don't want to,lose $100k so I will never put that kind of money into a single investment. 
Just saying if you want to get truly rich quickly, that's the only way to do it. The futures market will help,for a,lot,of,leverage, but no way do I want to lose $100k on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:23:31

Can you walk into your local store and give them gold bars as payment? How about silver? And yet there are trillions invested in them. 
A lot of people are using it as currency in places like Venezuela. Overstock.com takes it as payment and volume has doubled this year. 
Is it widespread? Nope. But this is like the top of the first in inning. 
It's like Amazon in 1997. I remember those days well as I came out here to SF for the first dot com boom. People poked a ton of holes in companies like Amazon, and there was some froth and talks of "tulips" but guess what came out of it? Amazon, EBay, Google and tons of other companies that wrecked retail and other industries in less than two decades. And yet people didn't believe for years. Just like you, just like now.

Let me put it another way: I went to Buenos Aries, Argentina. During their financial crisis, 1 peso was worth .10 cents OVERNIGHT. 
Governments Have and will manipulate their currency as they see fit. In scenarios like that, a digital currency like bitcoin, once it comes down, will have a lot of value because it crosses borders and it will still be worth the same or similar overnight. It hasn’t gotten there yet with the wild price swings we’ve seen, but I eventually it will settle on a value. And that value will be very valuable in deed to people and those countries.

I got some criticism here for buying GBTC at a premium, but guess what, I was able to sell my position in a couple of seconds yesterday saving me the 9% drop. And that was after a 168% rise. For the people just getting into trading bitcoin, just use this vehicle. Coinbase isn't ready for you and I know that most of you aren't ready for it either. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:58:51
Simplest way I can put it:
Imagine you're a farmer. You grow soybeans. You want to get a guaranteed $1,000 per bushel for when you sell them. So you buy a contract for a year from now that guarantees you will get that $1,000 NO matter what the price is at the time. Even if the price falls to $500 you still get $1,000.
Let's start there, are you with me so far?

The problem is you have to walk back comparing bitcoin to tulips. Bitcoin has the opportunity to have a major impact on our financial systems, tulips we're flowers and had no such impact, clearly just a bubble. Until you walk that back, there really isn't anything to further discuss. Now, I don't expect you to do that because this is reddit and people argue to the point of no return, but the tulip argument is one I have a problem with.
As to your point of don't put every last penny...you know, if I'm young, maybe I do exactly that to see if I can get out of school debt. Maybe I borrow 50,000 and try to turn it into 200,000. 
Personally, I wouldn't have done that but the youth have been lied to and misled for many years and it's just gotten them deeper in debt.

 Thanks… I honestly worry about the younger investors out there that are pouring every dime into this and eventually will get burned, especially short term. I actually hear people say that investing in the stock market is just like going to Vegas, and it’s actually nothing like that. In the stock market you have an 80 to 90 percent chance of winning in every decadeBut you see people hoarding money in savings accounts because they’re scared. A crazy speculative investment like this gives people a false perspective on what this world is really like. It’s fun to have 20 percent daily gains, but it’s not reality and eventually this will all calm down…

Right, but Obama had zero indictments on him or his cabinet for 8 years, so he was remarkably free of scandal. Trump is on another level of corruption entirely, please don't compare the two because it's not even close. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:21:22
Read this, it will help. You have to buy options upfront.
The thing is, I don't recommend trading futures contracts...to do'it successfully you have to look for small gains on either long or short positions. It's far different from the HODL strategy. But I think it will negatively affect pricing if traders can make gains either way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:18:24
Ok. Now let's say the price of soybeans goes to $1,500. You have a contract to sell them at $1,000. So that contract is pretty valuable and it'll be worth a lot to someone because they can buy a contract for 100 bushels at $1,000 a bushel and sell it for $150,000 instantly on the spot market. That's called being "in the money" and you profit immensely. But if the price falls to $500, you still get your $1,000. Obviously there are premiums you pay for buying or selling these futures contracts, but that's how you can guarantee you'll make a profit on your actual soybeans.
A key feature of futures is leverage. Meaning you only have to put up like $10k to control a $100k contract. 
Still with me so far?

Ok I'm going to take the opposite view: if you're young and drowning in student debt and struggling...go for it...this is the most real get rich quick scheme I've ever seen and people have a chance to change their financial lives forever. 
If you lose $50K at 25 you can make it up. But turning that $50K into $250K in a few months is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:32
You got it, there's a profit there. Now, to a farmer who might only make $50k a year, an additional $50K might be immense. If he makes $500k a year, an additional $500K is massive. 
Conversely, if the price falls, he still gets his $500K and the contract only cost him, say $20K.

Oh I agree it's early days for bitcoin. It's what it's potentially worth. You could say that diamonds or gold isn't worth anything either because there is literally tons of it that is easily mined on earth. You could find fault with any asset or currency...but realize that it's the early days where you make all the money.
There were a million reasons not to buy a Amazon or Google back when they were infancy companies. It's the uncertainty that brings the crazy profits.
Another example is I've been waiting for housing prices in the SF Bay Area to fall back to earth for two decades now. No reason they should be so high.
Don't try to always rationalize but sometimes just realize what's happening and give in to the momentum.

Will the GBTC ETF crash independent of bitcoin with the introduction of futures on Dec 10th and 18th?
The reason I've held it is its instant liquidity and security, (and making 175% in 6 weeks isn't bad either) but obviously there's like a 70% premium to bitcoins actual price. 
I didn't really want to have a coinbase or other exchange  account for security concerns, and like to trade in and out of the positions as needed, what are your thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:23:30
For long term investing only I would feel ok with 10% of your overall portfolio if you dollar cost average. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:46:45
Why didn't you just buy GBTC? RIOT Blockchain and Overstock are also ways to play the bitcoin craze without having to actually have a coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:40:31
That's fair, I'm not calling it a net negative necessarily, just that, for the first time, wealth can be created betting against the price of bitcoin. right now, thousands of people are creating coinbase accounts or buying GBTC to go long exclusively and are hoping more and more people join the party in the coming year.
Futures markets are by nature pessimistic, they were created as a hedge against rising commodity prices (as you know).

Yes. Higher reward and much riskier if you're trading. If you're hedging like Farmer Brown it actually lessens your risk.
Now, in the case of bitcoin it's a little different because ultimately what the CME does is match burrs and sellers but when you have something as relatively thinly traded as coins on the Gemini exchange, that could make it a bit more of a challenge.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:22:15
What's interesting is that if this was a US bank, you would have to immediately forfeit that money, if you spent it, tough, you'd have to pay it back. But bitcoin is the Wild West, if this really happened, that's incredibly fortunate as there's no way to prove it one way or another, I can see courts tied up with these types of disputes for years and years.

 Why would you expect an asset that’s  risen 1500+ percent to not have a speculative class of investors who are in it for short term gains? Why would you expect them to care about the underlying technology? It’s not like it’s easy to understand for people, but they see something going up so fast and of course they want to get in. I don’t hate those people; They fueled the rise and will be the  first to abandon ship once we have the inevitable correction. Personally, I’ve taken some money off the table myself. Seems only prudent 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:20:32

Your tired “Tulip” argument is a poor analogy. Block chain and digital currencies WILL be the future of financial transactions and we are looking at a major upheaval of traditional banking. Ever wonder why banks charge massive amounts of charges between currencies? It’s not like they can’t find an immediate buyer for the US Dollar or Euros. Money transfers that take days will take seconds with blockchain. It’s all going to be transformed.
Please don’t patronize cryptocurrency investors with a lazy argument like tulips. It doesn’t apply and honestly...you can do better. Do a little research for a couple days and you’ll see what I mean.

Let's say I think the price of bitcoin will be 12,000 by January 15th. I can buy a futures contract that will give me the right to buy, say, 100 bitcoins at 12,000 by January 15th for far less than actually buying 100 actual bitcoins. If it goes above 12,000 by Jan 15th I've made a profit on my options.

Long term advice: you’re still very young. Investments at your age should be in the stock market, mainly index funds. Drip drip drip every month and you’ll be amazed at how much you have in a few years and you’re set up while you’re friends are still in debt.

The only way to really make money in this is to be more than you can afford to lose. I put $10,000 in it and very happy I now have $25K from that $10k, but wish I had put in $100K instead, or even $200k. If I had put in $100k at the beginning of the year I'd be sitting on about $1.5M from that initial investment. Dang.

Now, a key part of these futures markets like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is they they have speculators who aren't farmers making bets on the price of commodities like soybeans. Since they have great leverage, meaning a $1 million trade can control a $10 million futures contract, even a 5% movement is worth 50%. 
Here's how that works: $10M *5% = $500k. So that $1m investment (which controlled $10M) just netted you $500K, or 50%. 
Now you can go long or short in this scenario. The dangerous thing is that you can lose MANY times your money. Typically if you put up $1 million and just buy a stock or currency, you can only lose up to 100%. But since you're highly leveraged you can lose more than that. Say the price declined $20%...you would be down 200% on your initial investment of $1 million.p because $10m * 20% = $2m.
Make sense? These are very mature markets and people have been trading them for decades. 
If so then I can talk about bitcoin and it's futures market. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:26:10
Just to give some perspective from a long time investor i.e. 25 years in the market. It is very hard to trade in and out of assets… I have been mostly in stocks, but I tend just sell either too early or too late. I’ve had some good stock picks, but also some bad ones over the years. Luckily 99% of my portfolio is index funds so I’m still doing great. Even though I’m up 250 percent on bitcoin, I know it can correct sharply At any time. If that does happen, and you panic sell, don’t let that deter you from investing for the long term in broader-based investments like index funds. This is fun and crazy times but not typical. A long-term strategy for real investing is the way to wealth, but it will take more patience. Good luck to all
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:28:42
I'm 99% in index funds and less than 1% in crypto. I think I'm ok.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:10:46
Right...my worry is that the futures market will, for the first time, allow investors to bet against bitcoin and make tremendous wealth doing so, 
Right now, everybody is long and want more and more investors to join the party, but futures contracts, which I'm familiar with, allow you to hedge against further rises and profit tremendously if it falls, 
I think there will be a lot of swings to both sides in the coming weeks and months.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:23
You also incur short term capital gains, which is taxes as income...i.e. Very expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:43:55
It doesn't guarantee it, but imagine if there are a number of speculators who will get famously wealthy if the price of BTC falls to 8,000 by say, January 15th. It won't be the relentless optimism on the long side that we have now. 
I'm an optimist long term by the way, but this will likely create a lot of volatility as the early adopters give way to the professional traders.
