You don't give any evidence that he is _not_ running a ponzi scheme. So either way, there are no proofs.
I would suspect that it is a ponzi scheme, however I don't have any evidence, so I say that I suspect it. Pirate is staying anonymous etc, so there are no proofs towards legitimate business either. Your article was therefore utter crap.

Are you sure mtgox can know what bitcoin addresses are connected to SR? I would doubt that. I would bet that the instawallet step is unnecessary.
There is probably some option in SR where you can get new "clean" deposit bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2012-06-12 18:05:16
If wallet ID = bitcoin address, then you have found a treasure. Normally bitcoin addresses are sold like for 10 bitcoins a piece. Lucky you!
@_date: 2012-06-05 10:13:02
It is very hard to know. But I think it could even be something like 90%
However, I don't see that bots would be circlejerking. Usually bots provide liquidity, they don't gamble. They take the easy money out of the market, using arbitrage opportunities. The people who want their bitcoins NOW (or want to get rid of their bitcoins NOW) and don't care about the price, pay the wages of the bots.

That's the fun thing, nobody can say anything about bitcoin economy. You don't really know what is behind those transactions. So your point "Silk Road activity is MAYBE .01% of the BTC economy" is probably just as valid as "Silk Road activity is MAYBE 90% of the BTC economy".
@_date: 2011-08-06 19:49:00
Drugs. Silk Road and similar sites. I'm already wondering, how in the hell haven't the demand already exploded much further. Perhaps exchange problems are on reason.
But really, you gotta admit that most od the trading places ( are probably selling only modest amount of stuff in bitcoins, meze grill and alpaca socks may be an exception. The greatest demand comes from Silk Road.
@_date: 2011-03-24 19:24:53
yeah... if bitcoin mining becomes really profitable, perhaps some bigger companies start doing it. but I doubt it will really be that profitable.
@_date: 2011-05-10 19:23:17
Simple, just buy some more bitcoins when you use your bitcoins for something. I have this situation, since I want to use bitcoins to support bitcoin entrepreneurs (probably will buy some bitcoin hosting &amp; domains for my projects), while I still believe in bitcoin value in long-term. I'm sure in addition of spending bitcoins I will be hoarding them too.
@_date: 2011-09-15 07:30:42
Well, it uses the JBitcoin, so it's like the same as android bitcoin wallet etc.
The problem with these is, that if everyone runs them, the network doesn't work since the network still needs full-fledged clients to survive. However they are much better from the user experience viewpoint than the mainline client.
@_date: 2011-04-15 09:46:47
Yep, exactly. Actually I think that pools are very stupid idea, I don't get why people are so excited about them.
For example, if we look at 
The top few users have solved almost all of the blocks. There are lots of "freeloaders", which haven't solved any blocks, just collect the statistically expected amount from the pool. For the top users it makes not much sense to mine for the pool, because it only gives them very little statistical security, and the pool takes its cut.
@_date: 2011-09-28 19:56:43
bullshit. it's a free market, all kind of bots should be allowed.
@_date: 2011-09-16 11:25:09
I hope that this kind of services will in the long term add the liquidity and stability of bitcoin.
And if merchants see the potential, they could hold some percent of bitcoins received. Eg. if a merchant wants to invest a little bit in bitcoins, he holds 10% of incoming sales as bitcoins, and converts the rest to dollars/euros. That way the merchant gets bitcoins pretty cheaply, and there isn't much risk.

The cheapest way to launder your bitcoins is to deposit them on silk road wallet, and then withdraw them. Silk road mixes all coins it has.

Well, if we start a company with 4 people, and each owns 20%, there is no single controlling force, is it anarchistic company? Well, stupid analogy, but I think that anarchism means more opposing the state, it doesn't tell much about banks. Banks are (or they should be) normal businesses, and technological innovations make businesses bankrupt all the time, as well as technological innovation generates new businesses. Bitcoin is innovation for the banking industry: new companies will be born, some old companies will go bankrupt, and some old companies will innovate and survive the change. It's more like normal business cycle.
You can't really enforce taxes on cash as well. But I guess state will find the way. Or not. Time will tell.

Also, this subreddit will soon hit 5000 subscribers... Let's celebrate!
@_date: 2011-08-08 08:18:30


Currently. Silk Road etc. have been available only for half an year. Innovations spread slowly, so will bitcoins.
Give it time. I'm holding all my bitcoins, and probably purchasing more if price drops even more.
@_date: 2011-04-15 09:31:44
Pool doesn't help with that. People are only mining in the pools because they eliminate the risk/randomness from mining.
eg. If you mine for a half year with a lousy CPU, it's highly probable that you won't get anything. But it's a possible that you would receive 50 BTC or even 100 BTC.
If you mine half a year in a pool you receive the statistically expected amount * 0.9 (usually the pool owner takes 10% or something). In a half year you earn in pool maybe 15 BTC. But you can't earn 50BTC, there is no randomness involved.
@_date: 2011-09-10 13:13:34


Why not? The longer funds are kept in BTC, the less there is BTC sellers over time. Less sellers -&gt; higher prices. It probably goes something like that:
- Buyer purchases bitcoins via dwolla or something
- Then almost instantly buys something from silk road
- silk road hedging sells the btc for dollars
- when escrow clears, silk road hedger buys bitcoins with the dollars
- seller cashes out and sells the bitcoins
The escrow time is probably 2 weeks. In hedging model, the funds are only short time as bitcoins, while previously there used to be 2 weeks waiting. I think that definitely might affect the price if the volumes are large.
@_date: 2011-08-08 03:05:04
Well, I have to admit bitcoin has changed my reddit browsing habits. Nowadays I always check bitcoin subreddit first. The growth is slow (only +3 in six hours), but steady. And if the other subscribers are only a tenth as fanatic as me, we have more to follow.
@_date: 2011-10-28 02:21:43
Well, we have some different way to interpret english. "bitcoins are used by criminals" != "bitcoin users are criminals".
Same way as dollars are used by criminals.
@_date: 2011-05-10 19:29:00
Look at bitcoinwatch.com statistics. Last 24h overall volume was 564,870.22 BTC, while mtgox volume was 43,794.93. So mtgox explains only less than 10% of bitcoin changes. This means that people are trading with bitcoins pretty heavily, or just moving their bitcoins around without reason (some people want perhaps move their bitcoins to safer places or something, i dunno).
Anyway, 500k bitcoins is almost 10% of total bitcoin supply right now. So bitcoins are moving around pretty heavily, but I guess nobody knows if there is real trading involved or is it something other.
@_date: 2011-03-23 10:55:48
Well, it's not the most easy concept. I have MSc from CS, and have been programming my entire life, and still it took some time to get all kinks of the bitcoin system.

some heavy shit. remember kids, if you are going to run your own exchange, remember security.
@_date: 2011-08-08 05:02:53
You are correct. But I don't agree with "I doubt there will ever be an effective attack that can start from the hash of the public key without being an insane brute force."
You have to note that people have now insane financial motive to crack the cryptography. There will be some serious efforts from serious cryptography geniuses. Cryptography experts want some coke and hookers too, right?
@_date: 2011-08-05 03:27:28
He repeats the "effectively looks like banking" argument pretty many times. I think the vital difference still is, that although bitcoin is going to centralize at some point, it's still a _open_ system, not a heavily regulated and bureocratic one. Meaning anyone with enough cash can start running a supernode right away, without a permission from anybody.
@_date: 2011-08-01 09:25:18

@_date: 2011-07-26 20:15:39
Funny though that while the largest exchange got hacked, bitcoins value still dropped only a little. And it still has risen pretty dramatically past 6 months. The final thing that matters is the security of the bitcoin system itself.
As myself, if I look at sites like Silk Road, the growing number of merchants, the constant press, I think that the real bitcoin shitstorm may be just about to begin. But you never know. We will see after five years or so.

How this is better than silk road? No escrow system to protect the buyer, seller can disappear anytime with your bitcoins.
Silk road already has lots of very trustable sellers, with quality stuff. I see no reason to use service like this, when silk road is available with the feedback and escrow system.

Bitcoin is better than Hawala. You just need local exchanges, and enough users for those. For example, if I am in a 3rd world country, and have bank account in some western country, it makes sense for me to buy any bitcoins for a little less than market price - I can change those bitcoins instantly to dollars to my bank account and make profit. And this makes much better remittance system than previously.
Hawala is more complicated, and the costs are higher. It is still useful, but not nearly as useful as bitcoins.
Edit: Maybe Hawala traders could adopt bitcoin by themselves - great way to use existing infrastructure :D

@_date: 2011-08-04 05:16:25
Yeah, if we look at where bitcoins were half a year ago, it's unbelievable how fast the progress has gone (
Drug trade is a powerful thing: while Silk Road and similar sites are running, we can always say that there will be demand for bitcoins. There will be some people who will buy bitcoins at whatever the market price is, because sellers also peg their prices to the exchange rate. What will a heroin user do when he runs out of heroin? Do whatever it takes to get some more heroin.
Althought I'm a little worried that widespread illegal use will be destroying legitimitate uses of bitcoins, eg. people start to think that bitcoins are used only for illegal purposes.
@_date: 2011-04-15 09:17:13
Lol, don't bother with it if you are going to mine with CPU. You won't make anything. It's not even worth the time you are investing.
But however, if you still want to do it, forget pools altogether. Just mine for yourself, if you are lucky you might make your first 50BTC in a year. Note that STATISTICALLY you make more by mining for yourself than mining in the pool.

You can sell the software via the tor network - and actually, there was some software (trojan bitcoin miner and shit like that, unfortunately) on tor for sale with bitcoins.
It could help, but probably not. Customers are not going for extra lengths to receive their software. And the trust the seller more when they know who the software seller is.

Interesting analysis. "Big-time" criminals can't operate if there isn't enough money in the system, therefore they need legal businesses to adopt bitcoin first.
@_date: 2011-07-04 12:55:00
I don't think bitcoin by itself is anarchist. It can be used for anarchist purposes, but by itself it is not anarchist at all. It is just technology, which allows inviduals to store value on their computers, and removes the need for banks.
@_date: 2011-05-11 08:10:27
well, mtgox is ok i think. they allow free deposits from SEPA area. The downside is that they convert your euros to USD, but it doesn't matter to me. It's very cheap if you consider it, mtgox is taking only 0.68% from the sale.
Of course withdrawals are little harder, mtgox charges 2% from withdrawals.
@_date: 2011-07-06 13:00:07
There is one more point: you spend bitcoins on stuff you can't get any other way - this means drugs and weapons. And maybe other services too.

@_date: 2011-07-26 12:19:21
Who can predict the future? Currently, the usage of bitcoins is still very little. As goverments/banks are printing new euros and dollars like hell, bitcoin value could rise even more in the future as people start seeking safe havens for their money. But you never know, maybe some technical glitch could take the value of bitcoins to zero.
@_date: 2011-09-29 17:17:56
Highly speculative article. The open-transaction project is in a very early stage, so it is too early to say that it will dominate the world.

I think the right action for the buyer would have been first to initiate the payment, then mark the payment as complete. I don't know what bank OP is using, but I find it hard to believe that bank allows you to submit payment, which it is unable to process.
I think the right action for the buyer would have been to cancel the whole transfer after he noticed that the payment can't be submitted/processed.

Why to spam the network with those microtransactions? At some point they will become unviable in every case. Better to do it properly from the start - let the affiliates collect balance, and do automatic cashout when the balance is big enough.
@_date: 2013-02-25 15:04:15
This. The best way to understand is by doing. Buy small amount of them and try transfering them back and forth. Then examine the transactions on blockchain.info
For example, see the block here: 
The miner who found that block earned 25.22330001 BTC, consisting of 25 block reward, rest is transaction fees.  You can see the transactions there.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:47:41
AFAIK the localbitcoins process works in a way, where you have to initiate the transaction instantly after you have made the trade request, because the rate is locked. If you can pay like half day after the request, it allows hedging against the market price movements - eg. don't do the payment if price has moved down.

OK looks good, but how do I know that the site is legit? There are some fancy pictures etc, but if I want to chat instantly with some girls, I have to pay bitcoins first. What if I pay bitcoins and I don't get the girl? That would be a huge turn-off.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:47:13
OK, here comes the review. 
It was working instantly, and the girl was the same as in pictures and looked good. Everything worked perfectly, although it seemed that it was video + text chat only, I couldn't hear the sound.
I was pretty disappointed that the girl was not showing her face by default, only body. But I didn't request it.
This was actually my first time using webcam service, although otherwise I am pretty experienced wanker. I managed to get little aroused, but then I lost ideas what to request from the girl, and ended up just chatting with her. The time was over pretty quickly, and I didn't find it arousing enough to purchase more time - at least now.
However I am pretty sure that I will try out this kind of service once again in the future. I would never type my credit card info to any porn site, so when I try again it will be either this site or some other site which offers bitcoin payment option.

Then again, the buyer admits that he marked the payment completed before it was actually completed. Of course it is not payers fault, but bank limit, but anyway.

@_date: 2013-11-21 16:43:30
Well, if he did the payment of 5k when the trade amount was 7,5k, that was clearly a mistake. He shouldn't have done that anyway. It would have been smarter to cancel the trade before sending that amount, and open new trade for 5k.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:14:16
To me it sounds like the first payment didn't go through, because bank had the limits. The payment was marked paid already. _After that_ the buyer initiated the two payments (5k and 2.5k). The right action would have been to cancel the trade after the initial payment was rejected by the bank. I don't see what is dangerous in that action.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:06:49
Of course it is difficult question, but I don't agree. The buyer clearly broke the rules, and should have taken different action.
