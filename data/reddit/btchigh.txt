Scammers and hacks?

You sound like an idiot is what he meant to say.

At least you didn't lose it all pal

Is the Electrum wallet syncd with the blockchain?
They might require 6 or 10 confirmations before being available to prevent double spend attacks. Check blockchain.info for confirmations. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:44:09
I got one and it's legit. At least the links work. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:47:41
Math failure
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:48:42
I'm not certain, maybe he likes girls?

@_date: 2016-08-04 19:42:56
Make sure your wallet is sync'd to the blockchain. Use blockchain.info to search for the transaction.

I don't get it. It's a redbull with a bitcoin label? What's the point?
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:25:42
Like Real Estate for bitcoin?
You'd really have to target the whales. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:42:47
wut? The price is up from yesterday
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:05:31
So how are those seeds growing? 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:52:34
The problem I have is that's only online purchases. My area has dick for merchant acceptance. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:10:15
Is this part of the reason why Cuban's can't get European cars? 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:53:57
Good advice thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-01 02:39:39
Will it get this high? 
Definite maybe
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:24:23
You can't blame Coinbase for currency fluctuations. They provide a great service for the bitcoin community. The wait time is because the cryptocurrency world is filled with 5 scammers for every 1 legitimate user. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:25:08
Nice! Subbed. Never heard of it. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:25:04
They held my very insignificant amount of reddcoin for 3+ months, a technical problem caused them to not be able to sweep the funds. 
You should have never put anywhere near 1 BTC in cryptsy, much less 180.
They probably have some anti money laundering BS that you'll get an email about in 3 months. Big vern sucks.

They wont and this is bad advice

Bad time for buying Ethereum, gonna hit $5 
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:08:18
Why did they close your first account? 
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:32:41
has turned into *Cry About Coinbase from new Reddit accounts*. Store your own bitcoin, buy from local btc, Coinbase complies with the government blah blah blah.  Most bitcoin users don't give a fuck. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 01:49:11
 they have FL licenses
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:37:32
I don't get it. You want a bank account that converts your money to BTC? Why not just buy BTC with a bank account?
@_date: 2016-10-21 01:49:53
Why ask Reddit when you can ask their support? 
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:38:05
Buy them all and report back, soldier 
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:36:00
Don't broadcast that fact on Reddit; you will be targeted for attack. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:38:39
I don't have to read the article to know it's trash. Quantum computers will kill all encryption, duh.

Wow username checks out. Thanks a bunch!

Advertising his referral link is not unethical. He pays Google money, Google shares his referral link, if you click his advertisement he should be awarded. Don't click his referral link if you don't like it. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:14:13
It's clunky
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:15:20
Are people dumb enough to fall for the scam? Never heard anything about OneCoin except people screaming about it being a scam. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:19:37
Point of sale transactions is the only time confirmations matter to me. Otherwise I don't mind waiting a few hours for TX to confirm. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:13:19
I thought Circle was partnered with Goldman Sachs? 
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:16:10
No.
