fortunately a lot of it was litecoin i had mined and converted to btc. all in all after i sold the mining hardware and coins, i lost about $2k usd. i have a great job, own a home, nice car - not because of btc...so moving on wasn't too hard. lesson well learned tho

@_date: 2018-09-19 18:04:22
yes coins as old as day 1 can still claim bch and any other fork if they were in the same address as the time of the fork
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:18:31
my 2 cents it that if the physical coin itself is not self redeemable for the .25 btc value, i dont think there's any way to ever prove you are a trusted 3rd party

@_date: 2018-09-19 19:10:39
if you have time, id run any address including change addresses that report 0.0 balance and go here and see if any bch balance exists. then you know what addresses you need to export the private keys for to claim
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:05:21
you should be able to get the corresponding private keys for whichever address/addresses held coins at the time of the fork. coinomi app only supports a few forks but you should be fine. also check out claiming "clams" also can be done same method in coinomi
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:08:03
im sorry this happened but theres no take backsies with bitcoin. your best bet would be to go to the police with the phone number
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:46:00
what is the purpose of this exactly? these themselves hold no btc value nor private keys. who are you trusting exactly to hold .25 bitcoin for you?

ask yourself if you'd rather have 200k$ if the price does eventually go back up. buying at 200$ a coin, maybe some some to cover costs but i'd hate to wish i had more if i decided to sell it all n the price went back up

@_date: 2018-09-19 18:34:19
august 1 2017 was the BCH fork date. if you had coins in any address even until the day after i think the btc addresses even now empty can claim the bch. i may be wrong

@_date: 2015-12-03 21:38:36
it looks like the transaction id you provided was appended with the -000 at the end i removed those and was able to go right to the transaction. you can also enter the bitcoin address into the search field which will show you the transaction id for each transaction for that specified address. should be confirmed soon

Step 1: Prepare an Requirement Specification
Step 2: Create an Micro-Architecture Document.
Step 3: RTL Design &amp; Development of IP's
Step 4: Functional verification all the IP's/Check whether the RTL is free from Linting Errors/Analyze whether the RTL is Synthesis friendly.
Step 4a: Perform Cycle-based verification(Functional) to verify the protocol behaviour of the RTL
Step 4b: Perform Property Checking , to verify the RTL implementation and the specification understanding is matching.
Step 5: Prepare the Design Constraints file (clock definitions(frequency/uncertainity/jitter),I/O delay definitions, Output pad load definition, Design False/Multicycle-paths) to perform Synthesis, usually called as an SDC file(Synopsys constraint file, specific to synopsys synthesis Tool (design-compiler)
Step 6: To Perform Synthesis for the IP, the inputs to the tool are (library file(for which synthesis needs to be targeted for, which has the functional/timing information available for the standard-cell library and the wire-load models for the wires based on the fanout length of the connectivity), RTL files and the Design Constraint files, So that the Synthesis tool can perform the synthesis of the RTL files and map and optimize to meet the design-constraints requirements. After performing synthesis, as a part of the synthesis flow, need to build scan-chain connectivity based on the DFT(Design for Test) requirement, the synthesis tool (Test-compiler), builds the scan-chain.
7: Check whether the Design is meeting the requirements (Functional/Timing/Area/Power/DFT) after synthesis.
Step 7a: Perform the Netlist-level Power Analysis, to know whether the design is meeting the power targets.
Step 7b: Perform Gate-level Simulation with the Synthesized Netlist to check whether the design is meeting the functional requirements.
Step 7c: Perform Formal-verification between RTL vs Synthesized Netlist to confirm that the synthesis Tool has not altered the functionality.
Step 7d: Perform STA(Static Timing Analysis) with the SDF(Standard Delay Format) file and synthesized netlist file, to check whether the Design is meeting the timing-requirements.
Step 7e: Perform Scan-Tracing , in the DFT tool, to check whether the scan-chain is built based on the DFT requirement.
Step 8: Once the synthesis is performed the synthesized netlist file(VHDL/Verilog format) and the SDC (constraints file) is passed as input files to the Placement and Routing Tool to perform the back-end Actitivities.
Step 9: The next step is the Floor-planning, which means placing the IP's based on the connectivity,placing the memories, Create the Pad-ring, placing the Pads(Signal/power/transfer-cells(to switch voltage domains/Corner pads(proper accessibility for Package routing), meeting the SSN requirements(Simultaneous Switching Noise) that when the high-speed bus is switching that it doesn't create any noise related acitivities, creating an optimised floorplan, where the design meets the utilization targets of the chip.
Step 9a : Release the floor-planned information to the package team, to perform the package feasibility analysis for the pad-ring .
Step 9b: To the placement tool, rows are cut, blockages are created where the tool is prevented from placing the cells, then the physical placement of the cells is performed based on the timing/area requirements.The power-grid is built to meet the power-target's of the Chip .
Step 10: The next step is to perform the Routing., at first the Global routing and Detailed routing, meeting the DRC(Design Rule Check) requirement as per the fabrication requirement.
Step 11: After performing Routing then the routed Verilog netlist, standard-cells LEF/DEF file is taken to the Extraction tool (to extract the parasitics(RLC) values of the chip in the SPEF format(Standard parasitics Exchange Format), and the SPEF file is generated.
Step 12: Check whether the Design is meeting the requirements 
(Functional/Timing/Area/Power/DFT/DRC/LVS/ERC/ESD/SI/IR-Drop) after Placement and Routing step.
Step 12a: Perform the Routed Netlist-level Power Analysis, to know whether the design has met the power targets.
Step 12b: Perform Gate-level Simulation with the routed Netlist to check whether the design is meeting the functional requirement .
Step 12c: Perform Formal-verification between RTL vs routed Netlist to confirm that the place &amp; route Tool has not altered the functionality.
Step 12d: Perform STA(Static Timing Analysis) with the SPEF file and routed netlist file, to check whether the Design is meeting the timing-requirements.
Step 12e: Perform Scan-Tracing , in the DFT tool, to check whether the scan-chain is built based on the DFT requirement, Peform the Fault-coverage with the DFT tool and Generate the ATPG test-vectors.
Step 12f: Convert the ATPG test-vector to a tester understandable format(WGL)
Step 12g: Perform DRC(Design Rule Check) verfication called as Physical-verification, to confirm that the design is meeting the Fabrication requirements.
Step 12h: Perform LVS(layout vs Spice) check, a part of the verification which takes a routed netlist converts to spice (call it SPICE-R) and convert the Synthesized netlist(call it SPICE-S) and compare that the two are matching.
Step 12i : Perform the ERC(Electrical Rule Checking) check, to know that the design is meeting the ERC requirement.
Step 12j: Perform the ESD Check, so that the proper back-to-back diodes are placed and proper guarding is there in case if we have both analog and digital portions in our Chip. We have separate Power and Grounds for both Digital and Analog Portions, to reduce the Substrate-noise.
Step 12k: Perform separate STA(Static Timing Analysis) , to verify that the Signal-integrity of our Chip. To perform this to the STA tool, the routed netlist and SPEF file(parasitics including coupling capacitances values), are fed to the tool. This check is important as the signal-integrity effect can cause cross-talk delay and cross-talk noise effects, and hinder in the functionality/timing aspects of the design.
Step 12l: Perform IR Drop analysis, that the Power-grid is so robust enough to with-stand the static and dynamic power-drops with in the design and the IR-drop is with-in the target limits.
Step 13: Once the routed design is verified for the design constraints, then now the next step is chip-finishing activities (like metal-slotting, placing de-coupling caps).
Step 14: Now the Chip Design is ready to go to the Fabrication unit, release files which the fab can understand, GDS file.
Step 15: After the GDS file is released , perform the LAPO check so that the database released to the fab is correct.
Step 16: Perform the Package wire-bonding, which connects the chip to the Package.

so a miner already accepted the transaction for the very low mining fee, looks like you'll just have to wait it out until it's confirmed. blocks are being hammered full with transactions so it may take time
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:59:11
indeed it can be. however 90% of them are worthless and or have no real trusted wallet to do anything with

@_date: 2018-10-26 16:12:32
probably reaching out to coinbase support proving identity etc is a start
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:58:30
your previous addresses in coinbase are saved and can be sent to again without problems. the transaction id you sent 36e32757d17fe3f4bb386b62821256179709dee2f192bb34d48ffc3b500ffd85 shows unconfirmed. fees look enough to confirm soon. how long ago was the transaction sent?
@_date: 2018-10-17 03:08:30
I've been asking myself the same question. Well at least the value of btc + forks. What I do have a hard time grasping is the fact that it has been known that these coins could have the hologram removed and put back. Even graded casascius coins theoretically could be bunk if the seller was dishonest and used this method and recorded the private key then sold to you while loaded and swept it all once in the mail 
Its almost as if you have to crack it open immediately

looks like a pretty small miners fee. probably hasnt propagated on the network

it says not enough fee to be a high enough priority
@_date: 2017-04-16 20:25:46
its used to verify that you in fact own the credit or debit card used and have access to the bank to verify the small amounts charged. if i recall correctly they will refund those small charges after you correctly verify them

you need more money and cheap electricity than you can imagine to ever see a return from mining at this time
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:33:06
it will take a significant amount of time for the entire 40+gb blockchain to download and sync. I would install the core wallet, let it sync. you can either export your private keys from your blockchain wallet to import into core wallet or send your coins from your blockchain wallet to an address generated by the core wallet. mind you funds will not be spendable until 1. the entire blockchain is synced, and 2. the transaction confirms by the bitcoin network 
@_date: 2019-04-10 02:46:55
Congrats bro!!
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:52:13
you need more than a good mining software. mining with pc's and graphics cards are a thing of the past. You need dedicated hardware (asic) units that require a lot of money invested and cheap electricity to ever see a profitable return
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:10:58
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:34:54
the mempool size is VERY high right now, the fee sent with the transaction will confirm eventually

- Unzip and copy blk*.dat files into your bitcoin data directory C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\blocks
- Remove any database/log* files from your bitcoin data directory

yes as bitcoin price rises, any amount of btc you have also rises in value
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:23:51
since you already gave him your receive address from the bitcoin core - you need to export the private key and import into the blockchain.info wallet- if you delete the core without exporting the private key - and he does happen to send the btc to that address - youll never be able to retrieve it

@_date: 2016-05-17 13:54:43
did you record your 12 word password recovery phrase when you created your wallet
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:10:21
the wallet will sync over time - however it will take a long long time. bitcoin core requires the entire blockchain to be downloaded to your computer which will suck up space. you could export your private key from the core wallet. and import it into the blockchain.info web wallet
- Launch your bitcoin client
- Click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
- Click on 'debug window'
- Select the 'console' tab
- If your wallet is protected by a passphrase (i.e you have to enter a passphrase before you can send) unlock it by typing
walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
- dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]
This will return the private key which will start with the number 5
Once you have your private key if you had to unlock your wallet you can relock it by exiting or typing:
- you can then make a new wallet on blockchain.info's site with a really good password then import your private key into that wallet. this will prevent you from having to sync the blockchain

post transaction id 
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:42:42
thank you!!
@_date: 2016-05-17 14:52:56
it does not take days for a transaction to show up. unless that transaction hits that wallet and confirms - hes scamming you. I wouldn't send him anything until you get that transaction and you get 3 confirmations
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:41:50
very grateful! will pass the tips along!

if you have their level 2 verification, i have 1000$ a week instant buy which is an ach bank transfer with credit card as a backup if payment fails.
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:55:46
sign up for circle.com or coinbase.com, transfer paypal to your bank account, link that bank account with either of those sites and then buy btc =]
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:07:48
you cant purchase immediately using a credit card. credit cards are used for backup in case the ach bank transfer fails
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:09:19
the spelling and grammar is atrocious. Stay in school kiddies - these hackers couldn't spell their way out of a paper bag
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:33:31
i'll get right on that

awesome thanks!

 for specific countries
@_date: 2016-05-17 14:58:54
if it does appear on that page he did not send. the core wallet will still need to sync up to date before your funds would be available to spend. or you could import your private key into a blockchain.info wallet or mycelium or breadwallet mobile apps
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:31:32
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:30:14
first step - get your btc out of the blockchain.info services. these have proven to potentially be insecure and you could lose your coins. I personally use breadwallet and coinpocket on iOS. check them out
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:27:04
and...it's gone.

@_date: 2015-02-09 23:50:55

why wouldn't you just sell on coinbase or circle

he can export private keys from armory or bitcoin core - which can then be imported into a web wallet such as blockchain.info
This is how you obtain the private key for an Armory wallet:
In Armory-Qt, click on Wallet Properties&gt;Backup this wallet&gt;See other backup options&gt;Export Key Lists then click the button Export Key Lists. Enter your passphrase and Armory will show your wallet's private key. Note that a watch-only copy of a wallet uses the same private key as the original wallet it was created from.
This is useful if you want to send coins from an Armory wallet without using Armory, for example from an armory wallet address you imported into blockchain.info. In order to do so, you need to enter into the chosen service the private keys to the wallet you want to send from. In the case of BlockChain.info, the key it accepts is the one in PrivHexBE format, after you remove the spaces.
Word of caution: after you enter a wallet's private key into any online service that wallet is no longer secure. You should considering transferring all the coins it holds out - do not use that wallet again.
or 
Launch your bitcoin core client
Click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
Click on 'debug window'
Select the 'console' tab
If your wallet is protected by a passphrase (i.e you have to enter a passphrase before you can send) unlock it by typing
walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]
This will return the private key which will start with the number 5
Once you have your private key if you had to unlock your wallet you can relock it by exiting or typing:

there's no way to tell what wallet app a user is sending or receiving funds to
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:02:21
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:34:28
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:29:33
No problem. I have not much experience with armory but with the core wallet the block chain would need to sync for sure for current up to date transactions to show. Syncing could take weeks
I would figure out which wallet he used and export the private key somehow to a web wallet 
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:49:17
what date departure and return
from which airport to where??
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:26:58
Cash app allows bitcoin purchase
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:55:30
300 or 3000?
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:42:01
Free 10$?
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:53:27
Lol I know the feeling. Well I don't think there's a way to tell based upon address alone to indicate which wallet he used. If it's between core or armory it's better than having no idea at all. And plus you don't need to wait for the blockchain to sync to export private keys. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:01:56
lol what in the f*ck are you supposed to do with this?
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:06:28
the misspelling of "Aplication" was a dead giveaway to me. You'd think scammers would at least try to get spelling and grammar right. the email was atrocious 
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:20:53
What's even better than not being able to hind it in your mattress is the fact you can hide bitcoins in your brain
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:20:22
"MODERN REPLICA" meaning counterfeit
@_date: 2016-07-31 00:12:01
For sure and if it ends up working out for you keep me in mind for the reward :)

mining at home is done unless you have a ton of cash to invest in ASIC hardware and the electricity costs.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:16:20
4 years too late to mine with cpu or gpu for bitcoin. asics and millions of dollars of investment are the only way to turn profit

You are right. Losing 1/3 of your holdings just to move them doesn't make sense
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:51:13
I do agree square cash was difficult. ID wouldn't scan by their app. Once i got it working though despite initial difficulties it does seem the easiest way to buy aside from an ATM

Why would he not just send you coins to your own address? 
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:45:15
Well it doesn't hurt to dig up both wallets. With the seed you should be able to export private key from armory.. Keep me posted 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:43:22
why carry it in your wallet? it's really not good OPSEC
