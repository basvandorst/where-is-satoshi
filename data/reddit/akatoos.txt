@_date: 2017-03-10 22:48:04
We were bullish on the etf, there are issues with blocks, hardfork rumors and stuff like that. 
I hope not. But i think there will be a new crash. Just my 2cents ✌��
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:09:36
When bitcoin is worth millions. There will be no dip.
Because nobody will stay with 100-1000 of bitcoins. 
And they can't manipulate the market at that time. 
They will be sold/used much before that. At that time people will have 0.1 or 0.01 bitcoin each. Maybe some rich people will have 5-10bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:08:27
Yes bitcoindark and bitcoinplus is doing it much better then bitcoin now, all bitcoin's are in a pump. Be ready for a dump on all bitcoins soon ������

Why should bitcoin gain when antpool is with BU??
It's just a bitcoin hype. We will go under 1000 again. There is no good news to get the price up. But whales are good in this sh*t . And they love to eat small fishes like u!
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:54:48
Yes,thats true . But i just want more coins for my money ;)
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:22:20

Some people are just idiots. He seen a gain of 20$ he is hyping that bitcoin is back. Bitcoin will dump under 1000$ again. Pumpers need noobs like u. Keep going 
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:19:22
When it is approved, i will be with u. U are not going there alone ;) . It will not jump from 1000 to 3000 in 1jump. They need to make the etf ready. So i will be buying at 1300 or 1400$ maybe. But thats great for me. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:26:49
Sec have never had a default approval, so i don't think it will be there first. 80% we will get the answer in 12-16hours from now i think.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:07:33
Vinny lingham says that there maybe will be a dip soon to 850$-1000$
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:01:14

@_date: 2017-01-14 13:26:00
We are at 846$ . I think that bitcoin will increase slowly again to 1000 before february. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:26:20
I have heard of bitcoin back in 2010. But never look at the news, or reading about it. I'm fucking angry on my self :( . I have been buying from last week. I' think i'm a little too late :(

I dont have a link to that , was just looking at blockchain.info and there was a 220bitcoin transfer. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:21:53
Yes 0.8% 
But bitcoin is almost up 10%
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:30:43
The mining will continue until 2140 to get all bitcoins (21.000.000) 
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:10:24
No i am not. But it is a lot of money anyway.
I have just invested in a rolex watch too for 10k $ 
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:57:25
I have seen a flash crash. I bought at 1100$ next day it drops to 880dollars
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:54:10
That is not a problem. There are 16million bitcoins. If we buy them all, they will keep mining, and need them to sell to survive! I hope this will change after time. If we just can get many people on this train. 
I hope some rich people get involved in bitcoin. Bitcoin is to dangerous in the hands of the chinese. They act like bitches!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:54:46

Everybody make a big mistake her. The dollar we have today is 1,5x stronger then it was in 2013. 
Look at the other currencies against bitcoin. Dolar gained much the last 3 years!
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:28:12
They sell it with $ ?? To bad.
They should sell it for bitcoins and not $$ ��
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:07:42
We will reach 1300dollars in february. I hope then u will post this again.

Step by step. I make that fault. I bought 6btc in 1 week. And are now -1000dollar. I could have buyed 7 btc now. I don't know how much u will buy. But do it over 10weeks. Split it in 10pieces. And dont panic like me when the prices go up , and buy a lot. U can see -20% the next morning. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:04:08

Will u live with 2700dollars for a while in thailand? How long will that be? 1-2months? And what then?
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:31:20
In the future will it be very hard to own 1bitcoin. I have 6btc now. But i dont think i will have that in 10 years if bitcoin survive. 
I will tell u why. If bitcoin becomes very popular, the price will increase like hell. 1btc 100k -1.000.000k 
50% will start to sell there bitcoins at 50k
75% will start to sell at 10k
95% will start to sell at 100k
So owning of a bitcoin wil be very hard, i dont think people will hodl when the price is 10k++ . Many will use it. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:43:47
