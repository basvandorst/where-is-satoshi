Valuation attempts to approximate actual value.  Bitcoin started out being worth nothing.  Now it has some real value, based on its utility as a currency.  Is it dramatically overvalued at the moment due to speculation?  Almost certainly.  Will there be a correction before it continues to rise?  Probably.  We could make more money speculating, though, if we get a sense of when that correction will be and gain some sense of its intrinsic worth.

I used to be a waiter and was always pretty insulted by people who thought of it as a job of last resort that anyone who doesn't want to do anything else is entitled to.

I don't have a story but I do do graffiti and it would be very nice to someday say that telling someone that bought me a week's worth of paint, after the $0.50 worth of BTC turned into a hundred bucks.

I have to listen to congressional subcommittee hearings for my job, and against all odds, I can say that this is generally untrue.  It DEFINITELY seems like our representatives are self-interested and bought out from an outside perspective, but in my observation, they are all primarily concerned with helping American citizens.  The disconnect comes from the fact that they need money to do this, and many of them seek to help Americans by creating jobs by working with massive business.

How confident are you guys about moneygramming to random people off the internet?  I've never bought off of localbitcoins and I'm kind of sketched out by how easy it would be to take the money and run.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:46:52
How could anyone possibly follow this logic?  "One time, some stuff got REALLY, REALLY popular before crashing.  Bitcoins are only KIND of popular, so there's no way we're gonna tank!"  You have got to know how ridiculous that post looks.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:40:09
It's a mainstream media outlet....their job is to spark controversy, not deliver actual news.  Who cares?
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:07:00
Do you think there's any threat of USG recognizing that virtual currencies are an unstoppable force and dealing with it by taking out BTC, then using the technology to create its own, more controllable version?
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:48:04
This kind of thinking definitely worked in 1929.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:16:29
Oh, cool.  I guess I never thought about that.  Do you think the possibility of anonymous purchase will really come back?  I figured that would be one of the first elements cracked down upon.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:08:19
Yeah, I think the first part is pretty apparent.  I'm curious about the acceptance portion, and what the banks' business could look like in a BTC economy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:36
What do you recommend for instant transactions besides coinbase?  I can't purchase anymore through coinbase until my first transaction is completed.  Apparently 10 days isn't enough time for that to have happened yet.

I'm saying this is obviously coming from someone who has never been homeless and at the library 8 hours a day, looking for work.  Elitist, privileged mentality.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:23:41
USG decides it needs more money.  The Federal Reserve deflates the dollar by printing more of them, then lends them to USG indirectly by buying up mass amounts of treasury bonds.  USG pays interest on this printed money.  No central bank = no currency manipulation = no quantitative easing = no debt financing of government decisions = no spending the rest of our lives paying for decisions THEY made FOR us.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:18:08
Yeah, I love interacting with people and loved being a waiter for that reason.  Easy money if you like talking, being in a good mood, and spreading it to others.  No sympathy whatsoever for misanthropic service industry whiners.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:08:22
Restaurants typically have very slim profit margins and there is no way there would be so many of them if their labor costs tripled.  Get Uncle Same to put a gun to the GM's head and force a living wage, it will kill more service industry jobs than an Applebee's tablet ever could.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:56:46
That is insanely brilliant.  Thanks for explaining it, man.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:07:38
Definitely.  Fight widespread adoption at every step.  Drive the price back down.  Instability is strength.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:28:07
I think that's what everyone wants to hear
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:50:49
Do you still buy on coinbase and transfer over, or would you recommend a different method of purchasing?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:35
I've been waiting for 10 days on a pending purchase, then the site no longer loads when I open it.  Can anyone tell me if I lost my money?

If I wanted a commodity why the hell wouldn't I buy gold?  BTC is only worth paying attention to for its innovation as a currency, if it ain't a currency anymore it ain't shit.  Hate to be the bearer of incredibly obvious bad news.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:25:06
I think there will also be another bubble partially due to the switch.  Many people I spoke with said they wished they got in before it was too expensive.  They didn't have $1200 to throw around.  Well, now you can buy 50 mBTC because you've got $50 and suddenly it's affordable again.

Wow, very helpful.  Thanks for typing that all out.  All good things can be repackaged into lists of ascending complexity and paranoia.
How is the paper key "associated" with an address if it has never been on the internet?  And can you link to an explanation of what an address is, exactly?  Not trying to make you spoon feed this whole thing.

I bought some on coin base and don't actually know anything about buying through other avenues.  How can I transfer mine away from coin base to a safer place?

Really good point.  I'm pretty clueless about security; if I torrent semi-regularly, should I worry about even typing my bank information into websites like coinbase from the same machine?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:13:13
You're not going to like the answer, but people aren't rational self-interest machines and human beings typically fulfill the roles they've been taught to fill by society without questioning them.  If you object to this, you should spend more time telling people what they're capable of than blaming them for not doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:28:07
I am personally making a concerted effort to make the jump away from English, but I understand your underlying point.
Napster always flashes in my mind when I have this discussion with myself, though.

How do you do this from a coin base account?

Same...what do you think is the risk of coinbase getting hacked though?
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:21:56
I think that's far too simplistic of a viewpoint.  It's popular to divide the world into competing camps aiming to send BTC either to the wastebin or to one-world-currency status; the reality will obviously be more nuanced than that.  The paper explains a lot, but it doesn't say anything about how to determine the fundamental underlying value of BTC, for example.  I think anyone who hasn't invested in BTC is an idiot.  I also think anyone who thinks there won't be a correction, and isn't attempting to figure out when that will be, and at what price, is also an idiot.  So I'm looking for places where people are discussing that with some degree of resilience to the ridiculous hype.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:43:22
Looks like they're out of stock.  Let me know if you have any other ideas because I'm surprised the price is sinking and pretty positive it's going to rebound.

Okay, sorry if I was a dick.  I deleted comment I posted because I really thought you were being snarky about it.  If you read the previous comment, the answer is that for the overwhelming majority of people, nobody has ever told them they're allowed to better themselves.  If you've ever been poor, broke, or homeless, or dealt with cops, or had a boss at a minimum wage job, you've seen firsthand that when you are in that predicament, your world doesn't treat you in a way that encourages you to pick yourself up.  It tries to keep you in your place.  It tells you you're a piece of shit.  This is very hard to conceptualize if you have not been in that position, but human beings naturally produce status hierarchies and 99% of humans very naturally treat people lower in status with contempt and disgust.  Then, as a basic function of human social psychology, people eventually accept the role they're given by others.  Everyone's heard of the Stanford Prison Experiment, well, it applies here too.  
This isn't even saying anything about the fact that every workplace has a culture, and on a macro scale, every industry has a culture, every class has a culture.  It's not as easy as just getting a new job, because if you're from an outgroup, this entails assuming a very different worldview, personality, and attitude. Again, this is the type of thing that is very hard to understand if it has never happened to you.  Why can't you just fit in?  Can you imagine some hood rat getting a job as a waiter at the Ritz Carlton?  No.  Why not?  Because the way they act -- who they are -- would make the customers uncomfortable.  Well, it's the same in any conceivable workplace.  There's not a simple solution to any of that, but I think the first step is to just take people on their own terms and give them opportunities to excel instead of telling them to get with the program and sleep easy knowing that the world makes sense -- if only people would fall in line.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:32:29
Would you be willing to explain what a paper wallet is?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:44:15
New name will probably spur more speculation.  Many people probably hear about BTC but don't buy in because they think $1000 is out of their price range and they already missed the boat.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:50:57

The more people start treating BTC like money, the more stable it will be and the better poised to work as a real world currency.  The more this happens, the more people will stop treating it as play money they can throw around freely, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:40:54
Yeah that rules.  Type of thing I could see popping up in the bay area, where a lot of homeless people are active on the internet.    I would just be careful distinguishing between homeless people and "real people" in the future though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:44:27
Because it has a consistent agreed upon value, which bitcoin doesn't, and if it did, that value would be entirely based upon its value as a currency and not an asset.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:29:50
If you want to blame someone, don't.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:10:06
I think part of this requires understanding that most people are somewhat passive and it's too easy to say "You haven't fixed yourself yet, so it's your fault."  People like us who rebuilt shit are definitely the tiny minority so at the very least I think I have a moral obligation to focus more on what I can do to help than what other people aren't doing to help themselves.

Good advice.  Important question, in that case:  Do you think bitcoin is overvalued due to speculation, based on the value it will eventually have, as measured by its usefulness?
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:51:28
Well God, why didn't they get an expert to do the math?

I agree 100% but there are two sides to every story, and you cannot degrade state economic control without empowering other sovereign actors - many of whom you may hate more than the state.  I don't care for USG but I recognize that at this point, the state is the only bulwark against the total sovereignty of the 1%.

No, I think you fail to understand my criticism: the fact that you can imagine a world where bitcoin mania is crazier than it is today is no proof whatsoever that the hype will continue.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:25:25
I think there will also be another bubble partially due to the switch.  Many people I spoke with said they wished they got in before it was too expensive.  They didn't have $1200 to throw around.  Well, now you can buy 50 mBTC because you've got $50 and suddenly it's affordable again.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:04:56
How could Bitcoin be changed as needed?   One of the objections to the possibility that it could be shutdown is that it is decentralized and thus only individual exchanges could be targeted.  How then could the system itself be altered?
