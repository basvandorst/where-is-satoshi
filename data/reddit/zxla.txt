I was thinking the same thing!

Nice idea. I always like these.

Same here. Exact same problem.
Sold  1 Bitcoin last Tuesday... still nothing.. only Pending.
The transaction on the homepage says "Complete" yet when I click 'More Details' both the Sell and the Bank Transfer are "Pending."
I used to love Coinbase.  Now I question them more and more it seems every week now.  I want them to be who they are trying to be in the market - bu the customer support is terrible and the quality of service is also dwindling.

SR 2.0 has PGP 2factor Login .. Heh.

Yes, do it.  I invested $50 to start off too and it turned into $150

she just had to test the water at $300... see's what she likes... she'll be back to hang around for a while.

I don't think it will be tonight.  I think the largest drawback we'll see is $40-$50 range.  The system and users aren't as vulnerable it seems.

Still waiting on my deposit from last week too.
I actually got a response from customer service.   I sold my coin last Tuesday, was promised them on  Friday.  The CS response said there has been some issue with their bank transfers recently - and they've fixed them over the weekend.
Good luck getting yours in your situation... but I Think it will be fine. I don't think they will keep your 3 coin though, personally. Just may be inconvenient with the amount of time it takes them to fix it.

Obv you don't understand how the pricing at different exchanges works...

+1 Thanks for this extra piece of advice. My brain wallet has 15+ words but this is still very very good advice...
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:48:31
there's a little dip now.

Buying the bullets while knowing they would be used in an assassination is very much so a crime. :-p

No DDoS... just tons of web traffic inquiring about the value of BTC
