Smart and dumb are relative.  Yes clearly compared to you, I am a genius.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:09:00
That's because they are dumb, permabull, losers.

That's only for losers like you who can't make money daytrading.  I lost a bunch of Bitfinex but I made 3x that much trading on Bitfinex the last couple of years.

yes good point.  Polo is a joke when volume is high.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:08:45
Yes of course.

Infuckingcredible, but that's what it comes down to.  They left 100% of our Bitcoin exposed.

Reaching for straws....as usual.

non sequitur.  No one cares.

Bitcoin should be going to the moon, not some guy with a BTC sticker on his back.  FAIL.

Yep because the internet will still be up and working in a post apocalyptic doomsday world.

The other day I had it set to "Priority" and fees were about $1.50.  I never saw it that high before and I just changed the fee to "Normal" and then was about 15 cents maybe, and it still went through OK.

Coinbase is terrible...definitely avoid.  I haven't used Circle.  Or buy on Local Bitcoins, which is better if you can get a good rate and feel safe.

Jesus freak inbred dumbfucks don't exactly think "logically" about such matters.
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:31:52
Have you ever heard of "Colorado"?   Your idea is incredible unoriginal.   Unless regulations change a great deal, no way Bitcoin will ever be used very often at dispensaries.

How do you figure that a public ledger means that "everyone knows everything" about the transactions?   That is a goofy statement.
But you are right that all the bitcoin that went into Mt Gox can be traced to every bitcoin address before and after that point.  That doesn't help you recover the funds or figure out who controls them in many cases, but you do know where they are.

Potcoin is a joke of a crypto coin, but I doubled my money on it in 24 hrs and that is largely what is about.  BTC is a more stable place to park your crypto funds though, especially if you know how to hedge and box them in at times so you really have no risk except counterparty risk, which is very significant, considering Gox and Bitfinex and others.

He is moving to the swamp and he will be fully immersed in it.  They didn't elect him King and even a King would need to have support from those around him to get anything done.  He will just be the biggest wheel in the Republican machine that does the same shit they do every time they get in office.

Potcoin tripled in price this past weekend.  It is now just double what it was last Friday.

Because stories like this aren't true.  In other news, India is adding 100,000 Bitcoin ATMs this month.

The price always surges 93.65 days after the halving, so we can expect to be over $2000.00 soon.
Plus Brexit and capital flight from China.

So Bitcoin usage is pretty much illegal in NY and NC now.  2 down and 48 to go.  And they will get to all of them eventually.
