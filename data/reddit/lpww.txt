I use a trezor. They usually send an email out explaining how they plan to handle a fork. It includes information on how to get your share of the new coin, along with an estimated timeframe. In the past, the instruction has been to wait a few weeks until it automatically appears. 
I think...but not sure...that certain exchanges will give you faster access to the coins at the expense of security. The security risk is no greater than any other time you are storing coins on an exchange. For example, coinbase is planning a 24 hour turnaround.
I can only assume that greenaddress will send you an email in a similar fashion to trezor. It's worth checking your inbox and the greenaddress website/blog in case they posted it there. Failing that, you can contact them to ask

Ok, I see how that could happen now. 
I'm not familiar with Word at all but wouldn't dragging the word to a different spot on the line result in 2 words being stuck together because double click doesn't highlight surrounding spaces? Did you notice that happen after you inserted the password into the document? If not, I think the only option is that there was an extra space at the end of the line and the moved word must be the last one on the line?

Awesome, good for you! How did you figure that out?

Dang, I'm out of ideas now!

Cool, that's awesome! I did something very similar recently but was able to write a script to resolve my issue.

That sucks, I'm sorry to hear about your situation! I am confused, though. Did you manually type the passphrase out instead of copy pasting it? It sounds like you should investigate getting a password manager to avoid human error when dealing with passwords.
Unfortunately, your calculation is slightly off. You will need to calculate 6,227,020,800 permutations for a 13-word passphrase. (
I'm honestly not sure how long that would take but the online permutation calculator that I tried maxes out at 5000. (
Are you sure you would have to try every permutation? Are there any words that you do know the position of? 
I would recommend that if you don't know how to write it yourself, you should not execute any scripts people on the internet give to you. You've already hinted that you're running Windows - it would be very easy for someone to trick you into running a malicious script.
