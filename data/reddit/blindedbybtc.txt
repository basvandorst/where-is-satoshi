that will never happen.  Keep talking yourselves out of buying while the rest of us who actually see the longterm value of BTC get rich

$3500 since January.  Plan on putting quite a bit more.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:31:12
Buy more, when they are $1000 a coin you'll be glad you did :)

Don't lose hope yet

From what other people have been saying, coinbase is not very quick to answer emails.  So I just wanted to add, if you dont see a response right away, don't panic.  I had the same thing happen to me yesterday and within hours everything was fixed.  They are experiencing growing pains but honestly I still think they are one of the least expensive and most convenient options out there.

In order to turn a profit, BFL would have to ship you an actual product, which at this rate isn't looking good.  Go over to bitcointalk.org and see what that people over there have to say about BFL.  From the looks of it all the top brass in the company are convicted swindlers.

Then you'll never be buying
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:46:45
that made me laugh

A store dedicated to "all things bitcoin" yet you can't pay for the products by actually using BTC, fail

So the coins have already cleared out of your account and into a wallet?  Sounds like bank error in your favor, if your that type of guy.  
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:50:30
umm, this happens all the time, if you've been "watching like a hawk" then you would know that

At the end it will only be major mining sources.  Solo mining won't be feasible.  The incentive to keep the rigs running is the transaction fees they will still be receiving

Grammatical error in your first line of text: "You are looking for a flight, a bus, a Hotelroom, an all inclusive Hotel, or a train and you want to pay with bitcoins? Now problem anymore."..... Now should be No
Spelling error in your third block of text: "We will look for the cheapest price and will book it whith you immediately after receiving the bitcoins. For that service we charge a surplus of 5%."......with is not spelled with two H's
I'd clean that up before doing any more advertising...

The limit, to start, is 10 BTC in a 24 hour period, not $100USD.  Despite the recent problems with coinbase I would still recommend them.  They seem to be getting their stuff together and all of my transactions have gone through with them.  I kept buying during their problems, trusting that they would bounce back, which they are currently doing

It says right in the top right corner of the website, BETA.  I wouldn't worry yet, I've had no problems to this point.  I have coins that are supposed to hit my account later today, maybe my opinion will change if I don't receive anything.

Yesterday morning, then again this morning.  Just have to be persistent 
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:07:14
Everyone has a price
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:12:02
You just have to keep trying.  I've been able to buy at every price point I wanted.  There is a program out that auto-attempts to buy every X amount of seconds.  Do a search, you'll find it.
