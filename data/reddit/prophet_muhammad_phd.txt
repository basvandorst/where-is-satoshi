These people can't understand the mere fact that the xbox one is at best a mid range pc. You think you'll get them to understand the intricate workings of cryptocurrency?

Oh nothing, apart from the genocide, raping the culture of the natives, enslaving the natives, raping and torturing of the native women, &amp; turning a blind eye to those who did the same under his rule. I'm probably missing something but that should sum it up.

I don't understand the problem people are having with this. Rude is an overstatement. You were pointing out a huge, enormous flaw. Yes you can gain access back but you should have to prove you even own the account beforehand. 
Perfect example that [posted](


Oh you do? Well the world doesn't run on trust. I trust tomorrow my money won't be locked away from me so that I can't access it. But clearly Ashley is not to be trusted therefore we place security measures so that Ashley's trust in others doesn't fuck up my account. What world do people live in where this is a legitimate business model?

Because there is value in walking the earth. Seeing thing sin person is much more of a grander experience than staying at home and playing a game. Knowing that boarders truly aren't there, that there are in fact a Fuck ton of places to see in this planet is simply astounding. With your attitude we'd be doomed as a species. In fact you and I would probably still be jerking off in a cave if it weren't for men like Ponce De Leon, the Vikings, the Spaniards, columbus (despite his evil doings) and men of such stature.
