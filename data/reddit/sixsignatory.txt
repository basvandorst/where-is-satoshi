I tried to use this service a few times, but it was amazing how many of the merchants in their network say they have never heard of it.  Or are out of business, or refuse to sell you more than $100 worth.  I wasted a ton of time driving from one place to the next.  I found a place who would make it work, but then they refused me after I showed up 2 days in a row - they got nervous I suppose.  I appreciate the fact that I can take them directions now and will try that.  But merchants get nervous when you start unfolding cash and trying to teach them to use their register equipment.  I love libertyx when it works though.

At least btc has the probability and decent track record of holding value for individuals. I would take that over a banking system and government that has only let them down. Banks are likely to be closed monday morning. That, indeed, is much worse than Beta.

Hate to step here out of my place, but let me offer this thought.  If someone has a right to healthcare and education then they have an unlimited claim on others to provide these things for them.  So if I want more education, a useful book must be written for me and a teacher must lecture me and both author and teacher must do so without regard to their desired compensation.  After all, I have a right to these things.  The result will be no one qualified will want to write books for me or teach me, as their life product is used up without their consent.  This is basically a price control that leads to a shortage of educational material and good teachers.  What now?  Do we force more folks to become teachers who might not want to.  Do we force someone to write an educational book to give to me. You cannot say, "I don't want to write a book." because others have a "right" to that book.  All this compulsion is the opposite of freedom and liberty.  I just should not be forced to live my life for the benefit of others against my will.  Its a more important "right" than your right to education.

Why not just have him transfer the btc to you right there?  There is no reason to have the btc transfer before the TV transfer.  Give your customer the specific amount due, especially with some specific penny (small value btc) amount, watch him send it, then verify the payment is received and give him the TV.

Chillax people.  Thanks for the advice.  Looks like its all give and take - hence the passion here.  Blockchain.info with 2FA might suffice where I am, but any more btc, and I need to get offline and go cold with a couple physically secure backups.
Sounds like every solution has its own new issues.  Blockchain.info is less secure.  Cold storage can be physically stolen or confiscated.  
I die in my sleep tonight, there's a whole other set of issues.  I have to keep a hard copy of instructions for the non bitcoiners in my life and all of that requires physical copies of stuff I have memorized.
I do not plan to spend any BTC unless it explodes in value.  And my instruction to others on my death would be to hold the BTC until its way more valuable.

How about this... I bet the Jaquars will win the 2026 Super Bowl.  I want to make the bet at today's odds, but I don't want to tie up my money for 11 years as the coin will not pay interest for me or anyone.  I guess without tying up the money, or by loaning it out to work, you open yourself up to the counterparty risk you are trying to avoid in the first place.  I'm generally ok with the deflation answer I guess, but my mind isn't used to working that way.

R3 freaking pre-mouthed Hearn's words.  On its face, its obvious coordination.  How can you refute that?
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:55:57
You are making my point.  People love to provide education and provide healthcare and resourceful people can and do find ways to do it more efficiently - as is proven by Vsauce and Khan. These are noble, praiseworthy, and rewarding ways to make a living.  There is no reason people who do it well should not be compensated to the value they choose for their service.  People who are forced into it will have no gain to be resourceful or joyful in their service to others.  A compulsory system leads to mean spirited, dour providers - which is another manifestation of the shortage mentioned above. The more important the market is to our lives, ie healthcare, food, education, etc, the MORE important a free market is.  It is the only answer that works.

Amazing how you put a room full of those regulators and big bankers in the room, and nothing is really said.  They each take to the mic and try to one up each other's platitudes.  I think the point of these meet-ups is nothing but a show; the real regulatory strategies are made in back rooms where rule writers and government-as-a-weapon will clandestinely attack anything they can't control.  But the statement this guy made pre-speaking for Hearn was amazing.  The conspiracy theory is that Hearn was paid to speak this.  Its not a conspiracy theory - Hearn works for them.  He continues to work for people who pre-mouth his words.  Undoubtedly, he takes up R3's mantle and must be pigeon-holed as such.  I'm glad hes gone.

By the way, you can just show up with suitcase full of cash and buy a house.  The real estate industry lobbied to avoid all KYC and reporting requirements.  Its how the big boys launder their truly dirty money.
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:44:20
If you think about the way real estate title records have been kept at counties for hundreds of years, its basically a paper blockchain, albeit centralized.  Instead of sharing a digital blockchain among a group of miners and nodes, a complete public chain of transactions is stored, standardized, and shared among all users (by being accessible to all at the courthouse).  It is the reason your ownership in your house is basically immutable.  (But yes, a digital blockchain is perfect for this.)

This.  An important part of the attack on bitcoin will be to blame bitcoin for the structural weakness of their fiat currency and fractional reserve system.

Can testify for libertyx.  Their network is not up-to-date, and you will find retailers listed there who do not sell pin  and some who are not even in business.  Some cashiers will not know how to use their own point of sale machines.  But once you have a retailer who can and will work with you, you could put a good bit of cash in on a daily basis.  Probably limited to $600-$700 per day.  Start slow with a smaller amount to get the process down.  I have had luck buying up to $300 in one pin.  All transactions have been clean so far.

Not likely.  Its a Federal Reserve banking system.  Federal is just as important a word as reserve.  The US Government IS the banking and money system - why would it defeat itself?  The printing press (fed reserve), regulation of citizens and the means of production (wall street and regulatory rule making), and the use of force (federal police and military) are ALL under Washington control.  If bitcoin is to depose any one of them, it WILL face the other two.  BTC will either be large enough to do this or will be stomped out completely.  Place your bets.
