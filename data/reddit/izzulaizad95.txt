because the last wallet I used, Remitano, doesn't really let you sell in bulk, unless someone wants to buy a bulk from you
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:48
and it'll continue to go up...
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:59:15
On which nut?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:33:16
That is so ELI5, thank you very much!
Both from Luno 
One to Kraken, the other to Cryptopia
If I'm not mistaken, Kraken has SegWit support. Not sure about Cryptopia. 
I got charged $30 for both transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:10:11
Is that the only wallets that support SegWit?
Also, since I already have half of my btc in Luno, which may or may not be a SegWit address (judging from the address which starts with a 1..., I don't think so), what should I do with it? Since a non-SegWit to SegWit address is not a SegWit transaction, does that mean that any btc I send from Luno is a non SegWit transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:16:06
I don't really understand your question? But maybe like half of the bitcoin I have right now? Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:42
Is there another way to do this without Coinbase/GDAX? They don't include my country in the list :/
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:29:51
Hmm okay. But for now, should I transfer the btc I have in the non Segwit wallet/exchange to a SegWit supported one?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:03:06
I overcame that by telling myself over and over that in a few years my measly investment will turn into a few tens of thousands or hopefully a hundred thousand. 
Enough for me to buy what I need at least.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:03
Trust me on this, it'll get back almost half of the drop in a week or probably less.
Plus, say if it dips 50% at $200k, I still made profit because I dumped when it was $9.6k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:39:57
It's on the internet so it must be true
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:39
My bad I think I'm mistaking a wallet with an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:54:04
Hah! Suck on that my Muslim peeps. Told cha!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:11:56
Everyone's talking about it before it happened. I wouldn't say I knew exactly at what price it's gonna happen, but I know it would. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:31
Thanks. Is it reliably fast to make transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:46:52
Exactly what I did the past two months. It's called DCA and everyone recommended it. 
The profit scales with how much you spend everyday. For the first month I got in, I set $7 everday. Problem is, I've set a goal to get a certain amount of Bitcoin, and with its price constantly going up, it gets harder and harder to get there and by the time that I do, I'd probably have spent 3 times the money as compared to if I had dumped the total sum accumulated from the increment into just one big purchase.
If you have the security and confidence to spend a somewhat large amount of money all at once, then by all means do so. 
I did it, and honestly I feel much better especially when all I have to do now is sit back and watch the price go up and not having to anxiously wait for a drop and rush to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:16:19
This is what made me dump my money in 2 weeks ago. So far dips only drops 10-15% (from my VERY rough calculation aka visual look at the charts), and by the time it dips, it'll still be higher than the ATH back when I told myself "I'll wait for a dip". 
Best decision I've made. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:18:21
Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:18:33
Can you explain what a pruned node is, please?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:02:43
Okay someone help me calm down a bit. I'm very new to the scene and I'm hoping on making a significant purchase sometime soon. If what you said is true (probably will be), then would it be better if I buy now or during the crash? Because I remember contemplating buying a month ago, then regretting not doing so with the price of btc now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:29:26
Yea but isn't is somewhat better to buy at the peak now because the price just keeps going up and the peak just keeps getting higher and higher? Assuming by a peak you mean ATH
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:31:12
Alright. Would I be contributing just as much to bitcoin as compared to a full node?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:50:58
If I dump $2030 in January 2011, I'd have $15 mil by today
If I save $7 daily from January 2011, I'd have $15 mil, but spend $17.6k
Edit: I know that a lot of people don't just have $2030 at their disposal, but for those who do, then clearly the first scenario is a lot more ideal, no?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:32
Explain please? I'm interested 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:32:23
I'm not planning on selling. Not until 2025, because my country's somewhat heading towards fiatless tnsactions.
But what I'm trying to say is, even if there's a dip, let's say from 7800 to 5500, wouldn't it be better if I were to buy months ago, when the price is even lower than where it got because of the dip? Like one month ago when it was still 4400. If I were to dump back then, I would still buy at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:48:25
Why do you say so? The only thing I find bad about them is the fact that the exchange rate is slow to adjust to the current price. Other than that, their support has been really efficient in my experience.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:26:44
I use Remitano and the (network) fees is 0.0005 BTC if you sell, and zero if you buy. Is that good or bad?
Is there an app that can notify me of a dip? I'm not addicted or anything but I find myself always scouring the net to see if there's possible attacks incoming.
I plan to buy until I have 0.1 BTC, but I use DCA and only save up to $7.5 per day which used to roughly equate to 0.001 BTC. I'm about 0.06 BTC away but I'd consider the amount of money I'm putting in to be relatively a lot to my standard. If I make a paper wallet now, can I add in more btc into the wallet when I buy more? Or do I have to make another?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:13:11
Can you set it to do that daily? 
Unfortunately, I don't think all exchanges have that
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:07:27
I know I'm capable of dumping money on it, but people keep telling me to use DCA. 
Why did I listen to them? Arghh the regerts
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:32:51
Thanks for the great guide!
How do I go about setting Bitcoin Core on my PC if it has less than 150 GB available? Is it okay if I download it to the HDD directly before setting up Ubuntu?
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:47:37
Sorry :/
Edit: And thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:37:41
It's the suggested BitCoin exchange for the SEA region, I suppose? I live in Malaysia and it's the only one that popped up as suggestion. But I mean it's gotta be legit right if it comes from bitcoin.com, right?
Yes, I'm also aware about the possibility of the govt taking control of the currency and such. I'm only investing small, but I'm thinking of setting aside a portion of my monthly salary for bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:32:54
Okay thanks! Will do.
