I bet to all of you that in the next few days China will ban all btc transaction and watch the price fall one more time. They always release the news as fud first and then wait for price rise a little bit and release the news as official

Fact: If you want to prove that your company is legit please show us the business license that you are allowed to be an bitcoin exchange. The government don't give you the permission, so it means that your business is illegal. You can be shut down anytime and you tell everybody that your company is legit? Moreover, there is no big company behind your back. No information about your capital. How can anybody can trust a company like that? Your CEO speak at RMIT saigon does not make it more legit. Many pyramid schemes and no name companies can be on the "legit" media like tuoi tre newspaper and VTV bullshitting about their business while they got zero revenue and yes, their company actually seems "legit" in the first place until they are not.
I am a supporter of bitcoin and i will be very happy if bitcoin can make it own way in Vietnam but this post is trying to give people false hope. Vietnam play no important part in bitcoin world and can not be the second Chinese.

So? What is your point? Are you a clone or something? Seems like you are not familiar with Vietnamese government, huh? They do not have hard time to do anything in Vietnam. If they are unclear about something they can ban it right away. Their ignorant about bitcoin will make it worse. If they realise that people still try to go against their warning they will start to restrict bitcoin trading, period. I am not a trusted source of Vietnam neither you are, so you can not actually "confirm" anything, and i am not bullshitting until you can prove that i am wrong

Is "China is no banning Bitcoin" a new way of saying "this is actually good news" ?

Since the company is innocent until proven guilty
Who said that? Any legit source? You are trying to make everything so complicated, they are not even a company yet until they have the picture of their license to do the business.
Let's say you open a restaurant without a license, is it legal? Or You have a business license in producing steel and you open a restaurant, is it legal? Neither the case are legal. The government is so ignorant and lazy to find out what it is until it become big. Once they know about it they will shut it down immediately.
In short, if they do not have the license which means they are not allowed to do business and which also mean they are not a legal and legit one. Is that clear for you?
P/s: Vietnamese government react to event and incident very slowly, especially technology related event, if you want something official let's wait for the next 5 or 10 years lol, but your business will be shut down first for investigation purpose.

So. Do you have any idea to protect ourselves. Because in mac we dont have any method to detect viruses and to know exactly whether we are infected or not. (We do have some antivirus software but it seems to be not very effective). Its ok when we know about this malware and prevent it in advance but there may be thousand more viruses that we may not notice and everything will be stolen from us

Guys, Vietnamese here and you should down vote this news. Those guys try to open an illegal exchange because the ministry of finance confirm that they won't allow anything relate to bitcoin  trading. Unlike Chinese where the law is strict. The government in Vietnam is corrupt and they don't really care about their own law unless something violate their own interest. So they can still open it and won't be fined.
Beside, the price of the exchange is so ridiculous that Vietnamese investors don't give a fly fuck about it.
In short, Bitcoin trading will not be allowed in the near future because the government won't give the license to the businesses which are related to it, but because the law is not strict they can still open an exchange without being punished, but still it is illegal
