do you own the bitcoin and can you withdraw the bitcoin, unlike robinhood?
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:39:20
Yeah I calculated that out and robinhood's fees are essentially 0.2%. So same as coinbase pro really. Still much cheaper than coinbase regular. But advantage to robinhood is if you want to throw in more money to buy, the money goes from your bank account directly to the robinhood wallet instantly and you just take the 0.2% hit. If you add money to coinbase pro it takes a week or so to get in so that you can take advantage of the 0.25% transaction fee. Otherwise you have to buy on coinbase regular and take the 1.5-3% transaction fee with the added on % deviation you mention with robinhood doing, although Coinbase regular is even higher! In total it seems like coinbase can cost you anywhere from 2-5% in transaction fees based on the actual transaction fee and the difference in price from actual live pricing to the price listed on coinbase regular.

yeah I just dont want to lose $2 instantly. I know it's minor but it adds up if doing lots of little transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:58:00
how are the transaction fees? and are the funds available instantly?
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:57:14
yeah if you had your stuff in coinbase reg for a long time, the funds are available. If you add money tho to either coinbase or coinbase pro, it takes a while for it to go to your pro account.

I was more upset that I couldn't buy the dip at 11k
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:39:12
Yeah some bankers or whatever had a huge sell off and the small timers have kept it still in the positive for the day. It will continue going up.

which of his statements are false there
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:15:22
This was pretty a pretty zealous comment. Its not sound money yet if people aren't using it to exchange for goods.

He is completely right.
Bitcoin did not go up in August in response to equities going down. Bitcoin did not follow gold's rise, even though many proponents of bitcoin say it is a digital gold...a hedge against fiat inflation and economic uncertainty. Well it didn't hedge. It just keeps going up and down in patterns as traders and bots play the game, and the game seems completely untied to events in real life regarding other asset classes.

Yes that's the only reason I'm still in

The price action excited me. Then all the zealots telling me their confirmation bias that explains how it will go to 1 million dollars per btc also excited me. So I learned more, and the digital gold store of value argument persuaded me the most...since currently no one is trading btc (transaction times are way too long). But the more days I see gold soar in direct negative correlation with equities falling, while bitcoin continues going in the same direction in its pattern formation, the less I buy that argument. It seems like its playing it's own game. 
If it holds a baseline level at 9k or so and continues steadily going up in the manner it followed gold's rise March-June, then I will become a believer again.
