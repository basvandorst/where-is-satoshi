Somebody in China made a lot of money in the past two weeks in this news/rumors/fud play. 
I'm guessing it was someone inside the Chinese media company Caixin who made bundles of money.

How many times will this rumor/news whatever gets rehashed to effect the market, this seems like some kind of high level manipulation.
No one has clear answers for a long time and when the exchanges answer its either confusion or denial and pboc says nothing. 
Some people have made millions and millions on this play, I expect the market to grow tired of it. Expect more cryptic  news reports that are intentional to move the market for some big players to profit off.

"China Banned Bitcoin" --&gt; Price Slide --&gt; Partial Price Recovery --&gt; "China Banned Bitcoin" --&gt; Price Slide --&gt; Partial Price Recovery --&gt; ad infinitum
Looks like a setup, someone is making a lot of money doing this.

Is this the bottom? feels like capitulation. Seemed like the whale purchased 4k or so coins and was still rolled over abit. Whale took a strong stand, I hope it was a turning point.
