Hi all. John Reinsch from Xapo legal here. Bitcoin wallets like Xapo and our competitors are required by law to collect information about our customers before enabling certain functionality with the accounts. We understand the identity verification process (which you may see called KYC, or Know Your Customer, in other places) is a lengthy process, and we're trying to make it as frictionless as possible while still being legally compliant. If you have suggestions, we'd love to hear more. We hold our customers' information confidential, as described in our privacy policy and terms. But if you have more questions, PM me or you can reach our support team at support

Hi - This is false re "a promise for bitcoin" with Xapo.  I can't speak for other services but Xapo is a custodian and does not engage in fractional banking practices.  They're your coins, we just keep them safe when not in use and help make them convenient to use.
Edit - words.
