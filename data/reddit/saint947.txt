Seriously, I about fell off the toilet laughing at this shit.
This is like a fucking parody thread or something. Shit like this is why real money laughs at us.

That’s more like it (Mr. Wayne).
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:33:14
Holy fucking shit- is this copypasta?
Because *it should be*. This is next level bitcoin shit right here-

I ordered stickers from you this morning on that site! Small world, man! :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:07:35
Mine would be unreadable in a year from overuse mate.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:04:46
Interesting thought, but it will corrode and break down I think?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:29
I mined it myself in 2013. I purchased dogecoin for my parents from a subreddit that was popular then. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:29:32
My dogecoin assets have appreciated 60% in 24 hours.

You're really not giving me much in the way of useful, actionable information. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:51:43
So there is a fork? Possibly resulting in the merging of an alt-coin into BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:30:17
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:07:45
That was at least moderately helpful. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:04:49
TL;DR - Reddit is the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:47:25
Fear? I asked a question about a fork, of which there is clearly a conversation going on. That's an objective inquiry about a subject, not "fear".
Go back to your E-trade account, you're going to miss a big chance in ten minutes on the Nikkei. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:39:28
I think it's putting your fingers in your ears to call any potential threat to Bitcoin FUD. I'm seeing things about a fork on the frontpage of this subreddit itself. That's gotta mean something, so I wanted people who spend time here and actually know stuff about the current state of Bitcoin to weigh in.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:21:50
Mmmm I don't think so?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:40:57
Someone needs to submit this to The reality of the Socialist "dream".
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:42:21
Probably exchange for hard assets. (Gold)

I still have my half million I mined myself in 2014 :)

You have to know what's going on with that crypto. Thinking it's dead is not the great prerequisite, because if it was, buddy, Dogecoin is waiting to fill your pockets. 
It was killed by competitors posing as their own community members. Fucking heartbreaking.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:02:18
Jesus Christ when will you people get it?
If you panic sell, you earn yourself that pit in your stomach that you feel for eating almost 4K in loss. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:17:35
Fuck that shit, I'm waiting for this to go to the fucking planet's core, and then I'm buying in big. 
Cryptos rise and fall. It's the only certain thing.

You're really fucked up trying to incite fear and doubt in people who bought BTC and decided not to take the daily roller coaster ride by attempting to day trade it. 
Your post should be moderator removed.

The fact that minority “victim status” seems to be the only real currency with people today is fucking surreal.

I mean... I have 400K doge. Did it's value increase relative to BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:52:14
Retrieving my old wallet from deep storage and getting it to load &amp; sync to the block chain today definitely puckered my butthole.
Sometimes it feels like it's WAY too easy for your precious doges to just disappear into the aether ��
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:12:55
Uh oh, guess who just gave away the fact that they have less than $1000 in the bank!
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:42:57
Holy shit.
Enjoy the moon.
Dogecoin remains jealous :(
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:50:38
I'm so sad to hear about your Cryptsy loss :( I remember in the early days, when Doge was first listed on Cryptsy, it was like "OMG guys we're a real coin now!!" 
Oh how times can change ��

You just outed yourself as a fucking retard by thinking Trump will do anything other than mouth to mouth resuscitate the entire US economy.

You realize Hillary fucking Clinton literally sold 20% of American Uranium mining rights to Russia, right?
You absolute fucking idiot.

RIP dogecoin. Infiltrated by competitors, turned inflationary and made more worthless every day. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:59:03
No. It was infiltrated by altcoin competitors who convinced the community to go inflationary to "let other people join in later on down the line", thereby devaluing the currency everyone mined to that point then and in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:48:30
No, when it's at it's second highest ever, that's not a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:47:18
I have a shitload of tulips I'd like to sell you in that case.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:36:22
I need to mine a fuckload more doge.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:56:58
This guy should be on the frontpage.
