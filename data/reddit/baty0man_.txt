Because they need bigger competition! Competition needs to invest in dumb down iOS/Android app to appeal to the masses. Coinbase does a brillant job at that. They have GDAX for traders and Coinbase for beginners.  
Do you know how confusing Gemini and Kraken is for beginners? These people do not care about volume, order book or limit orders. All they want is buy Bitcoins.

You are seriously not cut out to invest in crypto. You need to relax man. Zoom out on the graph. Dips happen all the time, it will bounce back up. Stop trying to time the market and trade, you will lose money. Just HODL and go for a walk. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:27:08
Any minute now...
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:13:29
Just sell your shit then. I'm sick of weak hands that panick everytime there is a dip. I've been in Bitcoin since 2013, do you know how many time this graph has been posted? 
If you don't believe in the technology and are just here just for the price, you're gonna have a bad time man. It's all speculation at this point. But I still believe where are nowhere near the bubble burst.

If you have Android use the app called Bitcoin Calc
