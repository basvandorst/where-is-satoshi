Man, lightning is around the corner , you know that.
It will wipe out 75% of shitcoins or decimate them.
Bitcoin will become state of the art technology real fast.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:45:06

Great work.
Now remove bcrash, because it's not a viable coin.

Maybe, but you can always fork off and create a better coin.
The argument to keep everything decentralized is also somewhat a valid argument on their side.
Also everybody can open a lightning hub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:50
This is true.

Hi, no I think the same.
We 'missed' a correction form 11 k to 20 k.
This one makes up for the 'missed one' and the one that we would normally had at 20k.
Cheers mate! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:07:49
Thx Bitcoin JESUS 2.0.
Fuck Ver Aka bitcoin Jebus 1.0
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:28:38
Bitcoin wil stabelize around 17500-17600 then within a week break 20k.
This is around the previous 'peak'. We came up to high too fast!

I think they want bcrash as leverage when 2x should fail.

Makes sense, thx.

Between today and the next 2 years everything wil be online.
But not until Core Coders have vetted it.
Let them work in peace on it, and not rush it, or you could switch to ETH, for yearly bailouts due to lack of coding quality and vision. 
Cheers mate! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:03:15
Let the Genius people code in peace. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:48:03
I know but the difference now, is that segwit is live and adoption is increasing.
But most importantly we defeated B2X.
Miners (not slush what a stand up guy) / exchanges were put i their place, etc...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:28:56
Allready sold all my Bcash for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:55:01
Blocks weren't nearly full.
So each block in the early years were  just a few bytes of data.
The last year especially, you are downloading blocks of around 1mB.
That's the reason :)
Cheers mate! Good question.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:02:25
Good job mate!

Please, what a KUK FUD article and headline.
Look up Lightning Network, and stop posting this shit.

Their coins will be centrally controlled, no different then the current system only a different name / issuing authority. 
BITCOIN is not ===&gt; The revolution will be decentralized. 
That's the reason Bitcoin came to life!
Cheers mate!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:47:29
Sure, that's why he brought 8Mb blocks on Bcash for no reason.
Bcash is fine with 1 kb blocks if you ask me
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:29:00
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:46:24
I've withstood multiple hard drops, doesn't faze me.
Just saying If it wasn't for the fork drama /scaling etc. we would have seen this price level much sooner. 
cheers :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:12:36
Why the hell is bitcoindotcom still mining Bitcoin?
Roger told he was gonna stop now he has bullschitcash.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:30:35
All around decentralization.
Do you mean in terms of miners?
----&gt; meaning miners, develop team (more then 100 different people changing constantly), nodes, etc.
    Censor resistance.
do you mean outside of ----&gt; No, I mean in general people can find what they need to find for themselves on multiple platforms, there isn't a 'single newsoutlet' or something. 
    Brandname and network effect. .....
Does brand name and early network effect make it better?
------&gt;   That's not my point, Bitcoin has the best brandname and network effect. You asked what is better or bigger about Bitcoin, well.......
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:27:02

prolly around 60-80%
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:32:26
They better introduce segwit support!
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:00:59
Yet, his own brother teams up with such people.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:40:12
Again his brother Barry Shilbert has a stake in about 60-70% of the companies endorsing 2X
Alan should talk to his brother instead of tweeting ! 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:04:56
I think it's the last pull-back before we rocket above 6K$.
After that the usual 40% pull-back.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:52:53
I stand corrected. Thanks for replying. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:50:08
Great job guys! 
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:25:26
Bitcoin price will keep climbing.
Everyday new people join, who think they can trade.
On a nice day/week/month they get hurt bad trading, for example like last month.
The Hodler base keeps growing because every noob gets burned trading.
Next time they just wait it out :)
Cheers guys.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:38:37
You do realize that from the 50+ companies who support 2x,
Barry Silberrt has a stake in about 30+ of them? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:56:44
Great job!! Make us proud !!
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:38:33

Heck I'll be mining with 1080 Ti's come november just to help out. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:21:09
Not, if they can relocate, but this takes time of course. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:28:46
maybe different storage buildings/locations?
It's best we all wait for an official response from GBminers
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:55:37
Always around 70 degrees Celsius.
But I have extra cooling fans, etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:37:09
Indeed, thanks for your honesty.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:56:08
Nah, he told everyone on twitter a month ago, he only supported it untill segwit was activated that's all.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:03:24
Thumbs up guys! 
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:57:33
When we reach 20% the climb will intensify greatly
You can start to see that the time to get to the next percentage is shortening. (on average) 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:51:33
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:16:51
They switched back allready so it seems.

They were one of the first. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:14:23
Great statement guys! 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:47:22
This is Bullish, they speak of 2 chains, meaning bitchcoin wil get replay protection or Coinbase is out.
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:33:57
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:01:33
Not, with adequate cooling.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:53:27
Indeed I mine alts, and then instantly convert them to Bitcoin with Nicehash !
Btw Nicehash doesn't support NYA either.
They currently have 123 ph/S

Wang chun told everybody a month ago on twitter he is not supporting it.
He is just waiting to restart his servers probably until core 0.15.1 is out.
