In your scenario the legacy node 'falsely' accepts a transaction that will disappear from its chain because ultimately the node will switch to the hash-rate majority's chain. 
However, this happens by accident all the time and miners can do this deliberately with certain probability, which is why we have confirmations. Assuming 5% non-upgraded miners, only about one in 63 million attempts to create chain with more than 6 confirmations will succeed (`1/0.05^6`) - four confirmations, 160 thousand attempts. That's really expensive for the miners involved!

This article is brutally difficult to read, so I tried to extract the interesting portions. Satoshi is described as a man who is very secretive in front of his family but reveals his secret as soon as the journalist becomes really annoying. 
* "I am **no longer involved** in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.“ Nakamoto refused to say any more, and the police made it clear our conversation was over.
* Of course, there is also the **chance "Satoshi Nakamoto" is a pseudonym**, but that raises the question why someone who wishes to remain anonymous would choose such a distinctive name.
* Nakamoto **graduated** from California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, Calif., with a **degree in physics**.
* "My brother is an asshole. What you don't know about him is that he's worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You're not going to be able to get to him. **He'll deny everything**. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin.“
* A libertarian, Nakamoto encouraged his daughter to be independent, start her own business and "not be under the government's thumb," she says. **"He was very wary of the government, taxes and people in charge."**
* "I could see my dad doing something brilliant and not accepting the greater effect of it," says Ilene Mitchell, who works for Partnerships for Student Achievement in Beaverton, Ore. "But I honestly don't see him being straight about it. Any normal person would be all over it. But he's not totally a normal person.“
* In his correspondences and writings, it has widely been noted that Satoshi Nakamoto **alternates between British and American spellings** - and, depending on his audience, veers between highly abbreviated verbiage and a more formal, polished style. Grace Mitchell says her husband does the same.
* For the past 40 years, Satoshi Nakamoto **has not used his birth name** in his daily life. At the age of 23, after graduating from California State Polytechnic University, he changed his name to "Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto,"
* Perhaps the most compelling parallel between the two Nakamotos are their **professional skill sets and career timeframes**. Andresen says Satoshi Nakamoto told him about how long it took him to develop Bitcoin - a span that falls squarely into Dorian S. Nakamoto's job lapse starting in 2001. "Satoshi said he'd been working on Bitcoin for years before he launched it," Andresen says. "I could see the original code taking at least two years to write. He had a revelation that he had solved something no one had solved before.“
* Satoshi Nakamoto's **three-year silence also dovetails with health issues** suffered by Dorian S. Nakamoto in the past few years, his family says. "It has been hard, because he suffered a stroke several months ago and before that he was dealing with prostate cancer," says his wife, who works as a critical-care nurse in New Jersey. "He hasn't seen his kids for the past few years.“
* "Dorian can just be paranoid," says Tokuo. "**I cannot get through to him.** I don't think he will answer any of these questions to his family truthfully.“
Calling the possibility her father could also be the father of Bitcoin "flabbergasting,"

You are completely misunderstanding what this database is for. It only stores data for the local node, like configurations or things that the node learns about the network. This DB is *not* a datastore for the network. 
However, there are indeed hard problems that OpenBazaar has to solve such as reputation and distributed search.

Please don't recommend any wallet software using Bloom filters (such as breadwallet) to people who need privacy. Bloom filters give away all the addresses of a wallet. Breadwallet for example inserts address hashes and utxos of the wallet into the filter which enormously reduces the false positive rate. See

Well, unfortunately we have to live with this fact. If you don't have the time to read the blog post I refer to authorities: 
* [mailing list](
* [Maxwell's recent presentation]( (slide 12: "bloom filters are uniquely identifying")
* [Hearn in his response]( "The issues with Bloom filtering have never really been fixed, partly because it's unclear that they actually matter to people."

OB certainly also has promising aspects. I haven't looked at it in a while, but an ideal version would define interfaces for not only human to human but also human/machine and machine/machine trade. You'd write a bot that sells storage on the siacoin, updates prices, etc. Or you could easily write a frontend for joinmarket.

The consensus mechanism of [Elements Alpha]( and Liquid is not based on PoW (nor PoS). Instead, there are functionaries who are responsible for signing blocks in a M-of-N fashion. In contrast to PoW, honest signers only sign blocks on top of their current chain and therefore never allow chain forks. Assuming that most of the functionaries are honest, 1 confirmation is just as secure as 6 confirmations.
Additionally, a fixed set of block signers is not subject to the centralization pressure we see in PoW mining. Therefore, it is possible to significantly reduce the block interval without causing damage to the system.
EDIT: The above only applies to transactions within the sidechain. Transfers in and out of the sidechain obviously require the regular considerations about confirmations.

One of the reasons for Christian to make this claim is probably the block propagation data he collects at [bitcoinstats.com]( The idea is that if you have some datapoints consisting of blocksize and duration until 50% of your peers received the block you can try to extrapolate a blocksize for which the 50th percentile is still within a reasonable time frame.

Hey Bob,
very good question.


The false positive rate is defined as
    p(F|nP)     //probability of F given nP
Where F refers the event that the filter query returns true for an element and P the event that the element has been put into the filter before (and nP its negation).
You wanted to say something about 
    p(nP|F)     //probability of nP given F
for which you need to know the number of elements you previously put into the filter, the total number of elements you are going to query and Bayes' theorem.
In short this means that if you query a filter with a fp rate of 0.5% with all pubkeys in the blockchain (56 million, mid-January) you can expect
    0.005*56000000 = 28,000
false positives. If a wallet owns let's say 200 keys then the probability that the key really belongs to the wallet given that the filter query was answered positively is
    p(P|F) = 200/28,200 = 0.0071
This probability is quite small and also the reason why a transaction that is relayed to a thin client is not very likely to really belong to that client even when there is a "unusably small" fp rate.
But with the "simple attack" F' that is shown in the post an attacker will only get one false positive when scanning the blockchain and thus
    p(P|F') = 200/201 = 0.995

It does (in theory) because it will be harder to guess if a transaction *is* actually "Bob sends 10000 satoshis to Alice" and not just the surface of something more complex.

I agree, his analysis is not conform with scientific standards and therefore misleading.
It would be highly interesting what would be found out when doing a proper analysis, for example using [JStylo]( the authorship attribution tools from Drexel University, after collecting a reasonable corpus.

It looks like a decent map, but I can not see a developer API which makes this site much less valuable. In contrast, coinmap just queries openstreetmap for nodes where "payment:bitcoin=yes". Therefore, a shop does not register with coinmap, but with open street map, which can serve as an open database for all kinds of interesting location-based applications.
 
[This is the raw query of coinmap]

Thanks for pointing out that blockchain.info's mixing service is currently inadequate. There is an [academic paper]( from July that deals with mixing services. The author basically uses the same analysis techniques as you suggested. He concludes with: "[...] both Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info
make it hard for an attacker to relate input and output
transaction. [...] We were not able to find any direct connections in the transaction graph of Blockchain.info.".
