so how do they make their money if they never charge fees?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:34:43
nort also means cold in English
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:01:33
they were already doing this... but either way, I don't think this is a big factor, because most of their transactions are off the chain anyways....
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:52:03
it's both... because you don't know what the Bitcoin developers will do.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:59:37
might as well say cash was used to pay for a steam game...
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:22:11
they probably need to hard-fork at this point... I guess they could always call it Bitcoin-cash2
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:48:14
However you want to call it, its going to be off the main chain and stored somewhere else.... Bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin at that point
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:06:36
I thought that segwit's max block size was 1.6mb....
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:58:19
bcore or bcash? my head is spinning....
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:12:12
All I know is that if Bitcoin drops to 0, I will try to buy them all.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:05:54
at that point, you are not really worried about fees..
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:18:51
to be able to more easily identify historical objects in the year 2200 ...
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:24:09


maybe because  is not  or  and this is fake 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:38:03
[or just a couple slices](
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:20:26
that's what the newcomers don't seem to understand... a fraction of a bitcoin is just as good as a whole bitcoin... it's worth less but you can do the same things with it...
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:22:35
don't they have to keep the same printing rate as the US government?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:20:42
there is still some time but they need to move quickly...
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:16:29
The lightning network moves the load off the main chain, and let companies handle and vouch for their own chains... (very bad, if you ask me... because it will centralize bitcoin, eventually)
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:36:13
recording the kids
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:54:58
by the time the lightning network shows up, it's probably going to be 15,000 pennies ... so it's safer not to include a unit;)
Just kidding.... this is just the product of the fake news networks.  CNN probably is doing the same thing.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:52:04
I really don't like how their servers go down all the time at the worst moments... but at least they will fully support Bitcoin-Cash soon...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:59:48
cardano already mooned... they are  in market cap...  .... you must be late to the party
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:29:10
exchanges should only be used for converting from one coin/currency to another and you then should take it out right away to your own wallet...
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:12:30
Go fold yourself?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:53:05
listening to guys like him about crypto-currencies is probably not a good idea because they are old-school and make their money from old-school ideas....
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:38:34
because LN is ridiculous... it will give too much power to corporations ... it's not too late to adopt a better solution since LN is nowhere to be seen yet.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:03:38
if you would stay away it would be good... what does your comment bring? brings nothing and is negative...
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:58:15
Since nothing changed with Bitcoin, it means that less people are using Bitcoin to make new transactions.... that's the only reason why fees are lower (because there is enough room in the tiny blocks)
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:19:38
actually, it transforms bitcoin into something else... maybe litecoin?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:17:06
it seems like it but I checked and it's day 60
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:59:33
whats the serial number?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:59:29
They could steal anyone's bitcoins... I guess Bitcoin is a good test for the SHA-256... if the NSA can crack it, how long will they wait to screw bitcoin over
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:01:30
if you crack SHA256, it just means that you can crack any wallet very easily... and that the current proof-of-work will be meaningless (it would need to be upgraded to something much harder, maybe something quantum-proof)...
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:39
why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:06
that is the reason why I bought ltc first (instead of btc)... in 2013 ... it doesn't matter to me anymore but I imagine that others might think the same, at first.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:18:34
I didn't get the memo, but is 20k for tonight?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:01
I think that it will get the alt coins back in business... because bitcoin will stabilize.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:41
yeah, I guess if you have everyone to do it like that then it would achieve pretty much the same goal. But the common person have to learn about satoshis...
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:16:55
zec and bch are going together today
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:03:17
why not also host your wallets in an encrypted file on public file hosting services like dropbox and others?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:17:52
allows only posts that are not really about bitcoin... also... can you insure that bad boy against theft?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:22
redditor for 5 weeks doesn't mean anything.... could be his new account.  I have about 20 reddit accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:14:05
I don't think that include taxes
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:01:17
sorry if I offended you... just feels like the miners are paying the devs so that they don't fix it... (but of course that is not what is happening) ... If you would give me a couple bitcoins, I would work harder on making it happen.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:25:22
good one, but for short term, I usually use MTD new high
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:03:49
I don't know what the best solution would be but increasing the block size would almost certainly fix the issue for a while (and give devs more time to get a long term solution)... and also probably kill Bitcoin-Cash.
So in this sub, you can't talk about alt-coins and you can't talk about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:28:26
The large investors might be responsible for some highs/lows but if Bitcoin keeps coming down, it probably is the developers that should be blamed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:21
I'll buy more at 75% off
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:43:27
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:18:35


@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:55
.... and 16k now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:44:34
If they crack your private key, they can spend the coins before you do... you can't spend them once they do.  But yeah, if you are quicker than the attacker, you could send the transaction before they do
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:30
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:04
it's so easy to start an alt-coin, I don't know if they can keep up...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:13:50
only when they don't blow me up... still alive, so far.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:22:30
Just figured out what happened... it is now trading on GDAX!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:11
what's a little? 0.25 or 10?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:01:05
yeah... if the majority would be blowing people up, there would be nobody left because there are so many of them
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:22:39
Just figured out what happened... it is now trading on GDAX!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:39:42
if you want to buy, just buy, it might come down after you do, but it should recover if you look at history
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:00
how close to a real world test is this? is that like an empty network?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:49:27
they are low right now...
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:37:49
lets get that fork going ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:47:11
if you buy for the long term, it doesn't really matter what price it is right now... because you don't know where the next significant drop in price will be.  It seems like the climb always slows down near big even numbers... maybe it is psychological
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:45:44
it's ok, they take turns...
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:30:30
back already
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:27
hmm sounds good, I would be able to get a whole Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:25
I would be about breaking even...
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:25:10
isn't it better to use the [bitcoin]( program? and dump the wallets to a text file? I would not trust either of these sites
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:19:43
I was already thinking that this would happen before I read the article.... I think that the price of bitcoin will stabilize which is bad, at least for me.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:52:26
sounds good... bitcoin-cash is more like cash; be-cash
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:11:47
make sure you take a screenshot of this reddit post that includes the pic 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:05
I'm not out of money and will wait for the dip coming up even if I hodl
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:02:04
Bitcoin can't process all transactions in a timely manner and the exchanges are not much better  (Coinbase being the worst)... exchanges probably should get sued.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:02
coinbase keeps doing this crap... they are ridiculous .. only when bitcoin is crashing... as if they are trying to control the drop.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:47:34
but they are transparent about it... they don't say that their site crashed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:50:04
if you deal with multiple crypto-currencies, it could be possible to send money to a wrong address
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:23:13
they have too much money in Dubai, apparently...
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:05:45
What some people fail to understand is that half a bitcoin is just as good as one bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:53:42
it's essentially what bitcoin used to be
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:31:27
the problem with the lightning network is not the fees... it's the centralization of transaction history
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:29:59
on the other hand, bitcoin cash is ready
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:56:14
I hate Bitcoin, USD and Stocks... but I still own USD and Bitcoins....
