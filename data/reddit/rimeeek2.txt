Learned a lesson...I‘m away for 3 days no possibility to log in but at least I set up a buy order at 11k but still I‘d buy even more now hopefully it stays like this until christmas.

Bittrex get your ETH wallet back up, I need my coins

Europe apperently.

Checkmate. Damn you outplayed me. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:36:00
Thank you!

I use it for CVC, is there any better hot wallet than Jaxx for this coin as ledger doesn‘t support it? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:20:33
And Coinbase charges fees for buying so I’m better off manually right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:17
How would this work? Did this person just sell 14,440 BTC on GDAX at once and transfer the money to coinbase and then into his account? Or do you have to split it or somehting?

Sorry but I'm hodling :)

Wow it’s impressive how badly these people are informed. I only got into bitcoin a couple days ago and could sit there doing a better job.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:29:30
Care to elaborate? :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:38:23
Great story, wish all the best!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:57
If I only had that much already...
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:09:24
Transferred 500€ 2 days ago...still not on coinbase. Now the course is up by 700€..

Is there any tool that I can setup to automate dca or do I have to manually do it. Just started to get into bitcoin and I‘m on GDax/coinbase.

I bought my first bits at 9240, better late than never I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:57:29
Judt set up my ledger and bought some btc bits last week, better now than never I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:34
I got this, was just wondering if got some reasoning behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:20:25
Gotta be a true hodler to hodle, am I right matees?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:09
Just by scrolling through the sub the dip/ adjustement is considered to come somewehere around next week, am I right? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:44:37
Same here...let hope IOTA stays that low for a while until I can transfer mit ETH
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:37:06
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:12:32
I mean I’d love to transfer if only Bittrex and Binance let me...
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:02:42
Downloaded it a couple days ago and I'm so thankful for this app, no more Excel Spreadsheets!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:58:13
Thanks :) Still waiting for my SEPA to go through because somehow my credit card cancels the transfer after I submit it and the price is rising every minute.

Congratulations and happy hodling!
