Pinning the reason on 1 political party is probably not accurate. Watch “The Inside Job” documentary.

IMO, crazy is a term used by those that don’t see things in the same way that others do. 
Being a business owner myself, and fully understand the repercussions of this type of decision, I believe that if a small group of individuals in the same industry, or community, made it common to do P2P transactions only, that the model would spread over time. Albeit, it would be a long hard road, it could be done. And it could be done anonymously with crypto.

Have you seen UTZ in Canada? Serious question. I know they are a regional brand and didn’t think they crossed the border. Cool if they do!

This has to be somewhere in the mid Atlantic. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:24:19
I would. And this thought would also only apply to those that believe once rules are created, they can’t be broken. Another good example of this is the drug trade, and we see how that’s been working out since the official War on Drugs started.....

Read some articles that they are working on increasing the effort to promote their co-branded card and mobile payment services. Either way, a great window of opportunity for crypto

One could argue that it being anonymous is better since there are no “buyers” like big pharma/corporate conglomerates/etc.... only allowing the candidate to run his own platform and have his/her ideas take shape.

If these are the chocolate ones, where did you find them? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:55:05
As I understand it, the coins don’t exist without mining. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:18:05
Do tell...
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:52:46
Grft is already integrated into some payment devices. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:21:05
Hahahaha hahahaha

I think what he was trying to say is if another prominent figure/business accepted crypto/btc for their products or services, it would be a much larger push for adoption, since they are viewed as a person of influence. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 01:52:31
There is actually a project that already holds all 3 of these, plus privacy, all on its native chain, while remaining PoW. I am BTC bullish, but this tech is very promising. Not going to shill and namedrop in this sub, but DYOR and find it.

I didn’t even click on the link. This was a great interview. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:52:11
I have referenced the studies on digital money as it’s used today. (Roughly 38% of all transactions in the US are made digitally, I believe is what one article stated) Then ask them when the last time they used cash was. This tends to get people thinking about how they currently use cards and not cash. From there, it’s just like keeping a well balanced checkbook, that only you can balance. Not a bank doing it for you.  
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:31:55
Well stated
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:51:07
Why would you NOT want to run a node to support the network if you intend on using it in the future? 
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:47:33
Do you have a background or experience in dealing with these equipment types? I’m quite a noob when it comes to this stuff, so wondering if this would be the best place to start for learning and setting up my own node. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:37:29
Maybe search your email if you had to create an account. This would only to be able to help identify which site it was. 
Good luck
@_date: 2019-10-12 19:58:10
I would be very interested in learning how to build one of these for my children.
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:41:18
My personal opinion is that it would be really difficult to outlaw/ban it.
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:22:27
I agree that within the cryptosphere, BTC is widely adopted. I was referring to mainstream usage. Even though there has been some very minor retail adoption, it still remains mostly avoided because of ease of use for consumers. If they won’t use it, no use in supporting it. This does become the chicken/egg convo though. Lol
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:41:21
You should do a chart on population vs mode percentage as well. It looks like the same percentage of the population in the US and China have nodes running. Good sign of awareness. 
Edit: I misread your percentage columns. US in the lead. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 05:29:43
I know they have a great head start, but I personally don’t feel that they are a direct answer. There are other alts out there that provide  even deeper security and true privacy. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:10:29
I see BTC as a currency, not a platform or network. I’m not disagreeing with you though. It has worked in the past, and will lend its experience to the future. One thing to keep in mind though, is that there still hasn’t been mass adoption yet, so the “old” protocols haven’t been established yet. Just my view of things. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 02:58:44
The alternative would be a coin that has all the features of multiple coins built into the first layer. Cryptography isn’t my wheelhouse, so I’m not sure how possible it is, but have seen some promising projects that have done wonders on their first layer, in regards to privacy, speed, and scalability. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:54:45
No, but I’m sure you can’t either. I’m not saying that you’re wrong, and the other comment is correct. I believe there are good points from both sides. That’s all. The old saying goes, there’s isn’t only 1 way to skin a cat. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:39:40
This is seriously painful to listen to. Contradictory thoughts. Ill advised statements. Bad statistics. Dig deeper my friend. You will eventually find the truth. Not just what MSM feeds you. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:46:21
You are greatly mistaken. The difference between you and I though, is that I don’t hate others for what they believe. I also don’t push my thoughts or agenda on anyone. Also, stating that blacks commit more crime, but also stating that marijuana should be legalized in the same sentence, should lead you to understanding that if it were legalized, most of the blacks wouldn’t be in prison. Non violent drug crimes are a massive population of the incarcerated in the US. I don’t need to go further into this. You can find all of this for yourself. If you are willing to look 
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:51:17
RVN (x16r) with enemy miner is likely the best for you. You can flip it for BTC quite easily through an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:50:12
Speculation? Or, can you provide proof? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:48:55
You can’t deny that there is good logic behind his statements though. Buffett has openly said that he doesn’t understand it. Tech wasn’t how he established his reputation. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:05:23
I didn’t assume anything. I listened to you

Those are some nice ass pool tables.

Govt can’t control BTC. That’s part of the beauty. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:10:04
What’s the quality like? I would love to get one, as long as it holds up against tug-of-war. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:34:20
Wow. I’ve talked about this dynamic before. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:21:01
It is only accepting cash deposits for BTC, not the actual coins, although, if you are exchanging them at the machine anyway, you could just convert at that time. I haven’t used one in quite some time, so I don’t recall if it gives you cash or a receipt to redeem at customer service. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:52:58
Oh yeah, that’s really cheap. Did you buy it locally? Or online? 
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:26:38
What state are you in? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:35:11
Why exactly is this here? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:37:23
If we started with agriculture products, that could be farmed by small farmers, without the need to purchase seeds from corporations, it might be an easy way to get some BTC into main stream use, without the extreme need for fiat exchange to exist. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:04:41
First in the US just happened
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:36:41
It’s a Coinstar machine. You can turn in your coins for a redemption code for BTC. KYC process is involved iIRC
