To integrate bitcoin with JAK the members need to approve, it's an educational challenge, i think they would approve if they understand it's principals.

So now i have spoken with the top manager in Länsförsäkringar Stockholm branch, they are officially closing ALL their customer accounts using BITCOIN.
This is totally NOT okay and shows one big problem with the current financial oligopoly system, banks cannot have power over peoples electronic money.
Running a company or being an individual without access to electronic money is sending you back 50 years which is not a decision a profit making business CEO has the right to take.
This is the time to act, to stand up for our financial rights! We are going to do this for all Bitcoin companies around the world - join the movement!

As a CEO with a big site as ( and the swedish site ( and a payment solution on its way, we have everyhting in place, customers, a great team, our new bitcoinwallet, sepa payments, compliance and then the bank gives you problems even when the service is fully AML and KYC compliant you are supervised by finansinspeltionen, they just don't care... It doesn't matter how much you prove your case to the bank, the only reason for this is that we are dealing with bitcoin..
There are several other european banks wich are bitcoin positive, it's just a big shame that the banks in sweden is making it harder for bitcoin startups to engange in this new financial race.

great news!!
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:29:02
I met an american professor in economics at the airport near san fransiscoin over a year ago, his view on bitcoin was that is was not real money, because it was not a legal tender in US. I then asked him that the american dollar is not a legal tender in Sweden, and thus, it is not real money?
He was very skeptical and pointed out that starbucks did not accept bitcoin, i then asked him that starbucks does not accept the Swedish krona and did that prove that the Swedish krona is not real money?
Then he left in the middle of our dialog, proclaiming that i was not listening. perhaps i was not, but his arguments were faulty, he should have pointed out that bitcoin is not a legal tender in any country, but then i would just say that gold is not either a legal tender in any country, does that make gold fake money i wonder?

Indeed, unlike other mining operations like gold, who are forever stuck with dirty energy and environmental impact, bitcoin can swiftly move over to green energy and profit from it.
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:49:26
S9's atm. I'll run the numbers on them and see how much profit I get from it. Then upgrade to better miners when everything is ready with battery and heating properly done. Not just air.
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:15:13
Good question! Will check.
@_date: 2019-03-14 07:15:24
The hard part is working with panels in Sunlight means they actually produce alot of energy, some houses burnt down in Sweden because of 20 kW energy suddenly went through the roof. There is no off switch.
@_date: 2019-03-13 11:36:11
So, The panels themself has a cost and a ROI of 5-10 years if you consume the energy, like making a toast or taking a shower. But they also increase the value of the property, let's say 50%. Instead of consume the energy I mine, the energy itself now has another price, let's say, the nominal market price to keep it simple. But I don't pay the 75% of grid cost and tax. So the ROI of the miners get 75% lower. The panels will last for about 50 years with a guarantee of 80%+ after 25 yrs. So basically, the real price of the energy is much less than the current market price.
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:55:01
Because the link between money and power has never been so strong. Bitcoin-mining is basically Thomas Edison's vision about the perfect monetary system.

@_date: 2019-03-14 13:08:29
A 280 watt panel produce +
225 watts 6 hours a day = 1.350 wh a day. For the first 25 years it gives 90% efficiency equal 11 Mwh and 75% for another 25 years gives 9 Mwh. In total 20 Mwh lifetime value. For $100 and another $100 in installation. That's $200 for 20 Mwh. In Sweden that cost $4000 to buy of the grid. That's 20 times the investment.
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:29:06
With panels like this, they have reached the price bottom. It's been falling many % each year but last year it flatten out. Yes it will continue to decline, but not as before.
New technology is 3-5 times more expensive, but then you get integrated and bendable stuff. These are the ones who will have a price drop the next 10 years.
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:38:27
Good advice!
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:16:01
I'll get some numbers up when I have them ��
@_date: 2019-03-13 11:04:48
I will be energy positive including the mining. But during the day I will produce way more and will only buy energy from the grid during night until my battery is in place.

The panels will produce a minimum of 80% of 280 watt the next 25 years. Yes, I paid upfront. But the value of the property also went up, probably it's more than 75% if you count every penny.

At 45 degrees sunlight they produce +75%, which means they will give almost full power 6 hours a day. Times 2,5 h is 15 hours a day. The S9s I run consumes 1,2-1,3 kW each.
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:11:37
I have several. My first  second  and third  ��
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:21:04
Yes, that's true. All energy intensive operations running on electricpower are now pushing us into solarpower. It's just more likely that mining does it. Since it need what the panels give. If you need heat, panels is not a good fit.
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:38:36
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:34:15
Yes! For now. But even without subs it's the cheapest form of energy.
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:17:38
I hope I'll get it down to 5-7 yrs with mining (not including any btc value growth). With just "Not buying from the grid" it's 9 yrs.

Sweden did the same. They banned onecoin and allow bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:21:43
It does. They are actually not profitable when running on the grid. I'm also getting a battery to be able to run 24/7, that's the next phase.
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:25:42
Solar panels are actually really cheap. The one you see produces +280 watt each and cost less than $100.

The panels around $100 each and powerwall with installation $5000. Not sure I will get a good ROI on the powerwall, but it's so nice and give me power if the grid goes down.
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:35:01
Thanks! ��
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:08:41
You have (produced) energy, and you don't have any use for it (right now) what do you do? Store it or Sell it. If the spot market price is low, you don't want to sell it, but store it. How? A battery is good for short time, like up to a month. Crystalize salt is good for storing heat, but not electrical power. Next we can do is to build dams of water and store it as potential energy etc. Or... You mine bitcoin, you convert electric power using proof of work to solve mathematics. This "work" has the ability to be converted back to energy when you use bitcoin to buy power from the grid.
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:40:27
Yes, you are right. During summer we have 22 hours of sunlight and winter only 2 hours. Those numbers you are referring are on a flat surface, which is extremely bad for Sweden northern sunangel and the likelihood you have a flat roof here is 0.
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:17:26
It sure is! You can also see bitcoin mining as storing energy and buy it back at a later time using the bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-06-01 08:31:03
That's massive. I get around 2.5 MWh a month from my setup. One insight I got is the number of hours of production is more important than number of peak kWh produced due to that mining is a time consuming process. I have fewer miners running from 5am to 8pm instead of more miners running from 9am to 3pm. And only run them during the night if the grid price is low enough.
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:35:04

True. I run them during the night of the grid. I only have power from 6 am til 6 pm during early spring and autumn. Summer is a different case, and also winter of course. But I'm surprised that I can run 3 s9 8 am without any direct sunlight
(clouded), and during peak I can run 10 s9 for 4 hours. I have 67 panels in three directions with low angel.
