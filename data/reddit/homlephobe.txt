Took them 10 days to respond to my ticket.
When I originally joined, I verified the bank account with the amount transactions. One day gdax listed I had no banks so I tried to reverify but this time I used the login to the bank, and it blocked my account because my bank has my first name and last name, while coinbase had my middle and second last name (full spanish thing, yknow) as well.
They told me to resubmit verification ID. I did it, it was approved, and my buy was still blocked. I cleared out my linked bank accounts and relinked them and now I could buy again.
Don't expect to support to give you something different. They'll ask you to submit verification again through their process. They're drones.

Coinbase in the easiest. Just make sure after you do a wire transfer, transfer the usd to gdax (coinbase's parent company's exchange, it's free to do so and uses the same account as coinbase) and you can buy with 0 fees if you place a limit order.
Other exchanges are Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken.

If I create a seed phrase on a different wallet (Mycelium), can I restore the wallet on Electrum, or are they app-specific?

Binance has quite a few listed. Servers are having some problems atm. Minimum buy order/withdrawal is $10.

You could've waited a day or two and at least broken even. Whether you believe it or not, the fact that it's getting direct exposure in one of the biggest exchanges (usd -&gt; coin), it will drive the price a bit up because people will see it as 'cheaper' than bitcoin.

Right click, inspect, change the amount. No photoshop needed.

People dumping and panic selling, and maybe buying a more "affordable" coin. Just wait for it to settle in a few days.

$10 in a few altcoins and sit on them for a while. You'll come up positive in a few years.

I bought at 13k a few weeks ago and here we are. Nothing is guaranteed. If you sell it, you are realizing your loss. It went up in price once, let's hope itll go up again.
