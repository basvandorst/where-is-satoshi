Charging fees is the old model, not the new one. It's a dying strategy, especially in a world when people can literally go their entire lives by banking from a phone now and never visiting a branch.

Wells Fargo's stock is where it was 5 years ago. BOA is trading at half of its pre recession days. JP Morgan has done better, but still flat over last years. They all make money but they aren't really advancing. They rely on old models and old clients to keep them going. They are dying, it's absolutely happening. And for the better.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:02:06
Agreed. BTC isn't bound by any rules that dictate it's worth beyond what someone will buy it for. It, theoretically, can't be over or undervalued outside of that fact.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:38:25
Most people on this sub don't know what it is....Most are just looking for a get rich quick scheme and have no care for adoption beyond the perception that wide scale use will increase its value and make people rich better than traditional avenues to wealth like traditional banking mechanisms.

"It has never failed" you realize that's true of any commodity until the day it does fail, right? Absolutely nothing wrong with DCA but it only works in scenarios where price is rising over time, which is not a guarantee, though most of us on here assume that's what will happen. Just pointing out DCA is not a panacea, especially for folks who need their resources to be semi-liquid.
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:57:32
Yeah, the last bit is my point. People toss around DCA like it eliminates risk, which it does not. It's a hedge that long term prices are trending up, and smooths volatility. That so far has been reality, but there is nothing stopping BTC from stabilizing at 3k for all time. Nor anything feom a few big governments outlawing BTC and crashing it to near zero. And I don't see why someone who actually wants to use BTC as a currency (you know, what it's supposed to be) would not want to DCA for the same reasons a HODLer looking to get rich would. Volatility is bad so hedging it is good.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:08:43
I think most on here correlate "adoption" with "I'll be rich" and yeah, definitely a disconnect there.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:33:11
"HODL" = "I don't care about adoption, I just want to believe that I get to be rich someday for zero effort."
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:55:07
So if it is a get rich quick scheme then I'm along for the ride. ;)
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:51:44
You realize that every stock, asset, or store of value that was doing well until the day it wasn't went against x years of data....right? There is a reason why managed funds dont necessarily just beat blind indexing; No one can predict the future. Trends, charts, and "data" make for good predictions, but predictions are wrong more often then right.
@_date: 2019-10-14 12:12:29
In the US this would be a classic gift scenario. For 100 bucks worth "gift giver" won't pay a gift tax (though for larger sums you may) and the recipient would pain tax on any gains over their basis (special rules apply to what their basis would actually be and it may not necessarily be 100) at the time of conversion to USD or if they spend it.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:27:37
Depends on who is advising you ;)
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:06:57
Make the B the BTC symbol O_o
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:20:08
And I'm sure that's exactly what people who bought BTC in the last couple months of 2017 thought too.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:23:45
Point to the part where I said anything about percentages.....
@_date: 2019-10-12 16:44:59
"Decrease or increase by a Factor of 10 or 100" smart a$$. You knew what I meant.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:00:03
May I ask why you own BTC today then, if not as an investment? Your hoping it's worth alot more in the future, right? Yeah, sounds like an investment to me.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:36:15
For the record, that survey was from 2013....5 years later was last year, and little has changed. No one likes banks but risk scares people. USD doesn't rapidly change in value the way BTC does, and until it has stabilized there wont be much bank disruption.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:42:58
I'd say "100% definitely maybe" does that answer your question? ;) In all honesty, as it appears your question is genuine, there is literally nothing in this world that one can say, with 100% certainty, that it will be worth more tomorrow than it is today. There is ALWAYS a risk to investing/re-characterizing wealth.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:02:06
"Governments won't outlaw BTC, even if they could." You realize governments have banned BTC, right? Outright (Nepal for example) and in effect (China.) They absolutely can. Will they? I'd agree with you that they probably won't, but it's absolutely possible. Also note that here in the US the IRS is struggling to get people to pay their taxes on BTC. Sure the crypto industry is worth something in employed heads and business taxes, but new industries tend to cannibalize old ones (if people have their extra cash in BTC it'snot in traditional banks), so I'd argue the net benefit to a given country is not necessarily substantial. I mean I 100% hope you're right, as I myself have a big bet on BTC. But I find myself often tamping down expectations on this sub, as people often appear to not foresee the risk in something like crypto. And my initial point, what began this discussion, is that DCA is a hedge but not foolproof, which is something many (not saying you specifically) dont seem to understand.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:11:28
The value of the dollar IS "the value of the dollar relative to the thing you're purchasing." That's how currency is valued. That's my point. It's like trying to argue that the number of KG's someone weighs is actually what is driving their weight, and not the other way around.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:26:17
I think it would just cost you in electricity and system upkeep/hardware wear. That ship sailed, unfortunately. I'm right there with you wishing I was on the boat sooner.
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:55:53
BTC is high risk, high reward. It's fun to dream that it could go x10, x100 in value but there is a reasonable chance it goes negative x10, x100 as well. If you plan to drop 200 USD into it and can honestly afford to lose it if things go really bad, by all means jump in and see what happens. But if losing that money would materially impact your life I would think long and hard. Safe bets like index funds are not exciting amd won't make you rich, but they are reliable and a smart play much of the time.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:23:13
As others are saying you probably should have tackled this 6 years ago. You could buy some time with a lawyer to review your case high level and get a feel for whether there is legal recourse, but honestly the 10k or so you may have missed (yeah no way you get 10 BTC at today's market value in any scenario) won't cover the lawyer fees.  Sorry about your predicament but I suspect it would have been a tough sell 6 years ago, and maybe impossible now.
@_date: 2019-10-14 12:07:50
Yeah but when a single person has the power to erase 1.8B in market cap and such people routinely do so, the result is manipulation, intentional or otherwise. Yes it's "same ole same ole" for the Hodlers used to it, but it's precisely this type of thing that repels mainstream staying power. Good currencies don't drop 1% in value out of the blue, let alone the multiple digits we have seen.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:27:47
Nice analysis but as others are pointing out it's flawed. The difficulty to produce something doesn't directly drive its value. I made a cat-castle once. Took a lot of time and effort, and there is literally nothing just like it in the world....But it's value is only what someone would pay, and they don't care if I spent 5 years making it....BTW I'm guessing its street value is hardly a single satoshi ;)
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:27:35
Well to be fair this happens with foreign currency conversions too. You pay tax on currency gains/losses as well. Or at least you're supposed to. Not really a new concept in and of itself. It's generally not an issue though because currency doesnt change wildly value every day (outside imploding economies at least) so the difference in immaterial. Once/if BTC stabilizes it wont be such an issue.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:38:26
I disagree that "inherent value" mandates consistency in valuation. That said, I absolutely agree with you that BTC looks more like a high risk investment vehicle than a currency today. That's what annoys me with the "hodl" fad, since if the goal of the community is currency, holding it does nothing for that goal and one shouldn't be apprehensive to spend today what may swing wildly the next. Long way off on true adoption as a currency. I just get triggered on the "no inherent value" argument I hear all so often is all, haha.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:33:19
Not really a "spike" when it's down 16% or so in the last 3 weeks....
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:39:26
Absolutely. You save what you can afford to save. 1.00 BTC doesnt really mean anything beyond being a round number.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:54:29
Interesting analysis but it just doesn't work for me. Currency derives its value from what it can be traded for. If I earn 100USD today there is an exceedingly high chance its purchasing power will be substantially the same 1 month from now as it is today. If I earn 100 BTC, i honestly have no idea what purchasing power it will have in 1 month (if i did I would be a very important person.)
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:19:42
I think the advice should to be tailored a bit in this case as OP said he only has 80 bucks or so in crypto. I think it's hardly necessary to buy a wallet which is nearly as expensive as the asset it's holding. My advice is using coinbase as a wallet, while unpopular here, is perfectly fine for smaller investments and trying out crypto. Once you are in the 1k or higher range, a wallet becomes a wise decision.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:16:49
I'd argue the "associated reason" is that buyers are willing to pay 10k plus for one. If no one was, no amount of manipulation to increase the price would work because no one would pay it. I can forge 15 appraisals that say my stick of gum is worth 10k, but that doesn't mean buyers will pay it....
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:44:27
In the US for sure.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:13:40
100% agreed there are many "early adopters" that don't much care for the currency angle and are more about trying to make easy money, which is only human. That said, "inherent value" is subjective. Does USD have "inherent value"? Not really, being "backed by US gov" doesn't mean much, as the US Gov doesn't back what 1USD will be able to purchase. Does gold have inherent value? Well it's tangible and people like to "do stuff" with it which makes them willing to pay $$ for it. But how is that different from say an intangible like a copyright? People "do stuff" with a copyright, and people will pay for that use. I get where you're going but the notion that an intangible asset/digital content can't have "inherent value" is a just a bit backwards at this stage in the game.
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:09:01
Short answer is yes, the second you sell the BTC you trigger a taxable event. Whether you buy or a car, alt coins, or apple stock with proceeds doesnt matter.
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:27:03
What is a "tax district" exactly, and in what scenario is my statement incorrect? If you're gonna call me out back it up.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:02:26
I see what you're getting at, i.e. countries treat it differently. I'll give it to you that I should have clarified "US" in my statement but I'll also note that most countries tax BC and my guidance, as a "short answer" (as in not encompassing every scenario under the sun) is mostly accurate with available information.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:14:56
Generally speaking, if you sell bitcoin for more than you bought it, you should report that income. There are factors that determine whether the IRS formally knows about the gain, but tax evasion is a very dangerous game to play.  If you made a bunch of money you can afford it, and if you made only a little the tax is immaterial so you can afford as well. My .02
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:11:04
Is it theft when you drive on a road? Or sit in class at a public school? Or have 911 as an option when stuff goes south....? the "tax is theft" argument is elementary and over used. If you want to live in law-less wastelands there are options around the world. If you enjoy the benefits of living in a society, there is a cost. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:14:43
Pretty much all current gov spend would already fall into one of those categories I think (US at least).
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:06:23
I've got some on CB but the fees are annoying. I've been using Robinhood a but since they dont charge fees. It's less convenient (takes time to add/remove funds, needs a bank account, and has somewhat delayed prices) but to save real $$ it works well.  I'm a but of a bitcoin amateur though so there are tons of platforms to consider.
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:11:20
I suppose governments like the US could decide to shutdown access to exchanges. Poof. Donezo. Not that I think it's likely at this point, as erasing wealth of voters isn't a good move, but it absolutely can happen, and has in some countries.
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:38:06
Perhaps....but most are not willing to circumvent law to be a part of what would be at that point black market currency. Not wishing for this, but OP asked what could sink it and US banning exchanges would be very very damaging.
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:06:53
"is weaponizing"....hate to be a grammar hawk but hard to take a geo-political/economic observation seriously when it comes off like a 5th grade student wrote it....
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:21:42
 It could fall to 3k again, it could jump to 20k again. It's all a gamble. Not much different than playing roulette. No one in existence can tell you if 8k is a good spot to buy at. My personal bet is that it will continue climbing in long run, and that's my play.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:36:08
In order for price to climb, there must be people to buy at the "top." For all we know 9k is the new "top" Sure hope not, but point is get off your high horse...
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:45:37
What is the "correct" BTC price, pray tell? I think your strategy works in certain scenarios but could just as easily fail if price doesn't nosedive and you instead find yourself buying in incrementally more expensive price points to "average." If that's your game by all means execute, just dont go around feeling high and mighty that you have unlocked some secret right way to invest or something.
