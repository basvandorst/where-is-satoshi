Yeah, I like it too. Thanks.

Hey, thank you for the donut.
Thailand is an amazing country, let me know if you need some advices.
And I'd really appreciate a good bitcoin dealer contact in BKK.
PM me or reply this comment about the contact.. what you prefer. thx
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:16:57
Yes, you are right, I could use debit card... I agree and said that. The problem is with the way too high taxes and fees, specially my government taxes for any kind of international payment. 
About "one possible solution", I also agree that sounded weird but I mean it's one possible solution and not the ONLY one... Though, that was a bad choice for words.
And about the fees is the only thing I disagree because I'm just counting transaction fees to move money around, which banks (and countries) charge a LOT just for moving money in the wires in days... I'm not talking about normal market differences and traders profit.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:06:32
Well said.

I see you're not anti-bitcoin and understand being tired of dishonest articles, thank you. I added that I'm not counting trader profit there because of your comment.
Bitcoin really helped me on that situation specially because it was a much better solution for MY case. If I ordered some kind of money transfer from my country without having a thai bank account (there's probably a way I don't know) I would have payed really high taxes (6.38% min.) for brazilian's government (what would kill the purpose of getting out of the country with paper money because they don't charge taxes for paper money if it's less than 10k BRL) plus bank/transfer fees (including exchange rate between BRL and USD/THB) and would have to wait for 1 to 3 days. With Bitcoin I had what I needed in 10 minutes and could do the exchange in the next day.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:52:22
That's a really stupid thing I did... yes. I Google searched for that I didn't find anything about the issue. A friend of mine who's been to Thailand told me to exchange the money there because it was cheaper... and so I thought it was okay. But the last place which exchanged BRL was Abu Dhabi and he was wrong or remembered things wrongly. I tried to exchange my money in a Brazilian Food restaurant, we talked a bit and one of the owners also did the same mistake the first time he went to Bangkok - which still keeps being stupid, I know.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:11:58
Agreed! And tag them too :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:52:32
Yes. In one of the exchanges, they told me that BRL is not accepted because of lack of volume for the currency. Abu Dhabi, as I said, was the last place they accepted to exchange BRL and that is probably because they have many tourists buying there and they have a really active airport full of connections.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:07:31
That's alright. I understand my situation is unusual in some ways and the taxes Brazil's government charges are even more ~unusual~ (a.k.a high as fuck). I should have explained this better, probably... because I think I understand what you mean about the dishonest posts around.
Thank you, wish you the best too. And I also hope the same about all this currency conversion nonsense.

"We are privacy activists who have dedicated our lives to creating the software that Silicon Valley will never build, the regulators will never allow, and the VC's will never invest in. We build the software that Bitcoin deserves."
Just loved it.
Wish you success.

No, you are safe. The length of the keys itself are the same... The only thing that may vary is the base58 encoding representation used to generate addresses.

Ask them to find out a single internet protocol that relies on a distributed ledger which is updated by computers around the world competing to find a result expected by a bunch of nodes on a p2p network in order to be the one updating the said ledger. :)
Of course, I'm not saying anything in favor or against BIP 100 or any other BIP with this argument. 
The point is... Giving shallow arguments while laughing at anything new is pretty easy and mediocre. Ask them for a better solution
@_date: 2015-08-08 04:53:23
The sad truth.

I think this is the best post about contrary positions here.

Very well said.

So is this article and the paper linked from this quote.

Exactly. Thank you.

My confidence comes from observing how fucked up the monetary system we have really is and how most of it is unsustainable. Bitcoin with the use of Proof-of-Work is showing to be a pretty good alternative to that and has its own advantages and disadvantages when compared to other alternatives like gold which is Peter Schiff's business.
And, yes, Bitcoin has big chances to fail - like every new tool/invention/product - as a good change to the present broken system if its biggest value is dismissed for people who forget that the PoW is a ideological tool for liberty and that if somebody wants a controlled/regulated currency, there's no need to use somethings like PoW.
Buy gold, land and bitcoin and keep hedged from worthless papers on the long run. :)

Whatever... Satoshi never signed up for this bullshit after all.
@_date: 2015-04-03 08:35:57
Yes. And they do that with rifles which gets the situation even "better" as the bullets often go many directions and through walls killing and wounding innocent people. And rifles are the default weapons to go. They also shoot to kill anything that moves and is not obeying them like boys and girls not stopping the car for police. Oh yeah, and we have to pay for this amazing service to society.
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:20:01
The public is still trying to find out what an internet browser is.

Nobody prescribed or ordered anyone to use anything. Use your brain.

That does not even make sense. Nobody is forced to buy or use anything.

Congratulations for starting :). Nice script.
You could also create a requirements.txt file with the requirements so people (and you) can only
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Does anybody know if there's anywhere people are already adding subtitles for many languages for this video?? I'd like to add a portuguese one for free educational purposes in Brazil because this is a really good explanation for 1:40m. Thanks.

I had linked this post here in a facebook's post but I think I made a mistake and were two different articles being mentioned so I removed it.

Hey! Just one more thing that I'd like to let you know (it's not big news like new exchanges around in the market, though haha). 
About the educational resources just have a look at our starting project called Bitcoin Hub which will have 20 free (as in free beer) events (discussion, debate, talks...) with teleconference for interested groups around the country. We also will go for some Bitcoin Square events (no exactly number right now) in Rio (at least... It's where we are based). And the best part is that we have some framework to begin but the project is intended to change a lot with the community/participants input. Thank you again for this report.

You'll probably like this talk by Stefan Molyneux about Bitcoin and Political Power which addresses what you mentioned. Just don't really give the explanation for why people accept this though. -&gt;
