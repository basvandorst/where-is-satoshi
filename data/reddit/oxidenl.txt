Well you arent the only one who learned it the hard way.
I've lost around 2 btc. Didnt check the link and tought i was on the official reseller site of eruptor usb miners, in EU

with the current proposed deregistration of Kenilworth,
What does it mean ? does it mean that they don't agree with the way Kenilworth is funding it? (btc)
Or does it mean there is something fishy going on with Kenilworth?

Everyone panicking and I'm just sitting here listening to some good music seeing my money "vaporize" And... I'm not even a bit nervous 
Just enjoying my music and a delicious snack
