I don't think you understood much of what I was saying. No one should bitch about what the "real" or "original" bitcoin is. It's a worthless argument.

Calm down, it's "just" propaganda.

I feel like there are a lot of americans in here. Who cares about being like the oldest shittiest version of something? Kinda like how americans think it's a good idea to lean on their somewhat outdated constitution. Older isn't better, it's worse. This propaganda war is pathetic.

I guess the problem is that the people you're preaching to also have an agenda.

There's a difference between diversifying in general and redistributing your bitcoin assets. Your last sentence means you go from one asset to another, right? If all your money was in bitcoin to begin with that's already wrong, and the switch probably gave a significant reduction of risk.

Which is the most technically sound crypto on the market in your opinion?
