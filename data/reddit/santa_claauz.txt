Yup. He blew it all. Wasted completely because of the shirt.
@_date: 2013-05-29 02:16:18
Ridiculously overpriced. Completely useless for mining.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:11:22
I'm kind of new here so please excuse the stupid questions. 
1) Price?
2) How do I use it? Can you just plug it into anything or do you need a good motherboard/fanning or GPU/CPU?
3) When will it be available?
4) Website with more info?
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:09:23
But why pay for something free?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:33:05
I meant do people actually tip.
@_date: 2013-08-06 03:17:48
How so? Most people here don't care about gender and just want more people to buy bitcoins in general.
@_date: 2013-06-09 02:33:23
I meant what is going on with them? Is it just that they are not reported to the public?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:23:17
I remember when people were saying these would be $45.... *sigh*. I cannot see any reason to buy this at over $200.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:44:56
Yeah, I was just worried that since it was international, the bank in Japan will refuse or something.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:15:48
Yes it may be vaporware but that still doesn't answer the question.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:15:12
Spare hardware isn't that hard to do. Also online wallets are the least secure option.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:38:27
DeFacto currency. There's a big difference. If it was the official currency of the united states then it would be centralized and everything would go to shit.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:17:07
Seems cool.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:29:45
Wait do people actually do this?
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:14:30
Then why couldn't you mine with a GPU when bitcoin started?
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:37:54
And everywhere else on the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:40:22
I'm more focused on widespread adoption.
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:47:58
They would still try to increase their chances. I think it's best left up to the users decide who to tip.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:18:27
What about the cydia version?
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:28:34
You still can't make a profit off of them since difficulty is increasing like crazy.
@_date: 2013-06-23 01:20:12
Isn't that kind of unsafe?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:28:41
But how did they get access to his phone?
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:55:47
I wouldn't tip him if I were you. He could be making it up for money.
@_date: 2013-06-17 15:16:19
I don't believe the world's first major decentralized currency should have a single central exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:44:34
I heard they're unreliable though.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:33:28
There's a difference between saying something positive and believing that the value of bitcoin will rise to $1000000 USD.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:42:21
But seriously why?
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:59:36
How does a piece of cotton paper have value?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:27:37
I'm sad now because I really wanted one of these. I've never mined before and I thought this was a good start.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:39:04
But why would a bitcoin trading website rely on centralized banks? And why would bitcoin users rely on a centralized trading website?
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:51:26
I thought this was a joke at first. Jalapeños get it? But seriously, how much do these cost and when can I get one? Also what's the hash rate?
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:12:56
Do you think they'll refund the $40 as well? I'm kind of new to finances and stuff so this is hard for me to figure out.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:35:11
I'm saying we shouldn't say only anarchists use bitcoin. It's one thing for you to be an anarchist and it's another to say bitcoin is all about anarchy.
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:19:40
People who know how to use bitcoin know how to use vpns.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:16:11
Bitcoin is fake money? How so?
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:35:46
You have no idea how incredibly impossible that would be.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:11:05
Well obviously not in a casino. They need house advantage to make money. I think it would only work with no house advantage &amp; 50% odds. Even then it's risky since you need infinite money to be assured a gain.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:29:13
Damn money thieves....
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:29:00
It only works under specific circumstances that do not exist in satoshidice.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:32:54
So two computers x FLOPS could have different hash rates?
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:21:13
If there's a $10000 ASIC floating around it better be getting 500 GH/s
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:28:38
We need people to see this. They have to know that bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. In fact, we should focus on how much easier it is to donate using bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:37:01
But you can get that everywhere else on the internet for free!
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:10:27
@_date: 2013-04-28 00:00:56
I think I read somewhere that with premium bitcoin tip it can so I assumed he had that.
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:10:15
Reddit accepts it.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:04:35
I figured those were too easy (honestly you can just google them). But there are so many things I could enter in to the cryptobin... I guess I'll have to wait for the next hint.
@_date: 2013-06-09 01:27:53
Bitcoin tipping by users.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:21:59
I think bitpay is a good way to get large businesses on board with it. But you're right, reddit doesn't really do many transactions.
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:27:53
Decentralized exchange anyone?
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:38:09
So it's not a custom amount?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:22:28
I've heard some bad things. In all honesty I don't really know.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:29:03
$1000 dollar bitcoin? You're pushing it. Still, we must get amazon to accept it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:21:06
We have to make sure they don't.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:39:38
Just because he talks doesn't mean bitcoin isn't succeeding on its own merits.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:27:51
They know my secret identity. I must flee.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:13:56
What gives cotton paper value? It's the fact that people have agreed to use it. The same thing that gives bitcoin value.
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:18:57
Perhaps but nothing encourages people to buy these if they will not make a profit.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:48:19
Days?! I thought it was 2-3 weeks?!
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:58:49
B makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:01:46
Big deal in users but not for purchases. I've said it before and I'll say it again: we need amazon.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:02:00
But I remember hearing somewhere Avalon ASICs were $1299.... Must've been a bad source.
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:38:36
Yeah, I agree with offline wallets but which one should I choose? So should I go with litecoins and are those exchangeable with bitcoins? Also why do I need a video card? Won't a processor work just as well?
@_date: 2013-06-18 23:06:37
Ha! You think the US Government cares about the constitution.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:54:29
Hardware wallets?
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:22:23
Lol that subreddit could've been a lot of help to me a month ago.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:04:03
What about litecoins?
@_date: 2013-06-28 02:57:43
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:52:42
I'm so lost. I know the answers to both riddles but I don't know what to do after.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:19:05
Yeah, this type of thing is exactly what I'm referencing. We don't want to brand ourselves as crazed nation-killers or we'll never become mainstream.
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:50:31
We really need a decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:47:12
Whenever someone says bitcoin is the road to anarchy I die a little. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:23:14
Looks really good but there are just a few things. 
1) the "choose your wallet", "you need to know", &amp; "support bitcoin" look bland. Change them back to what they are in the current website.
2) Replace P2P with Peer-to-Peer. Abbreviations like this make people think it's just another geek fad.
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:40:16
As can I. Only 4 more to go.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:30:32
I'm using the same app on my iPhone through cydia. Am I safe? Either way, block chain is sort of the "cash" wallet I have. I keep most of my bitcoins on my PC.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:13:16
Why would they ever not be mining?
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:15:49
Is MtGox a good alternative?
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:16:45
I think we should tip people from all subreddits to show how easy it is to transfer money with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:39:22
Secret trials?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:36:53
Cool. Is that all paper wallets or something unique to you?
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:26:59
Or is it?!??!
@_date: 2013-05-29 02:14:03
Difficulty is definitely going to rise though.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:49:02
This is why the general public doesn't trust bitcoin......
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:27:47
We need to focus on getting amazon to accept it with bitpay or something. After that we can focus on other companies.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:46:49
What better coins are there and what alternative do they use to mining?
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:25:12
I thought bitpay took care of the price fluctuation problem.
@_date: 2013-06-16 21:18:43
This is what happens when we put our trust into a central authority like this.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:45:18
Why not bitcoin address? Isn't it more direct?
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:12:19
Well can I just assume everyone knows everything that can be googled?
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:11:31
Only problem is how to determine a stable price.
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:23:26
Way too expensive. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:16:00
I have 0.05ish
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:31:42
I don't think it's doing anything.
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:55:30
Anyone wanna organize a group buy for these?
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:59:22
What about key loggers?
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:35:09
This is the first time I've seen a full link to a subreddit.
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:32:48
I still don't understand. What are you selling passwords to? Just accounts for anything?
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:31:22
I guess those are somewhat technical but they're not too advanced. Considering how advanced bitcoin actually is I think these are very simplified.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:37:10
Thanks a bunch dude.
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:20:20
Lol their 5 GH is about the same price as ASICMiner's 300 MH. But at least ASICMiner delivers.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:48:43
Wait is there a difference between flops and hashes?
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:15:47
Yeah, I think you can.
@_date: 2013-05-11 22:47:10
Geez don't get so angry. I wasn't sure if you knew that or not.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:12:32
I hope it's September 2015 because then I might actually be able to buy it.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:48:12
Hahaha no.
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:14:58
It gives them the power to control it.
@_date: 2013-04-07 00:45:40
I'm pretty new to bitcoins. I don't have a wallet but I'll figure that out soon enough. I just want to figure out how this whole bitcoin thing works. I don't know how I'd prove that I'm new or anything but I really only want bitcoins to see how they work and I don't really care about how much just yet.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:41:08
Seems like a waste to me. People will be doing this even if you shut down the subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:08:35
They didn't tell me it would cost $40. Is there any way to undo this?
Edit: I figured it would be a percentage transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:10:48
I cannot understand the incentive for people to pay virtual strippers.
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:57:05
This is just alienating more people. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:19:09
What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:05:07
Most people don't understand that. They think someone could push a button and steal all of their bitcoins. And it doesn't help that it seems to be tied to anarchy.
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:30:57
And you can use it for gaming or other graphic-intensive activities.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:19:47
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:22:21
Yeah, we need an absolutely secure hardware wallet. On that note, what security downsides does bitcoincard have?
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:12:20
Everything's going well but we still need to make sure everyone doesn't just join them because they're the biggest.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:06:10
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by bitcoin dispenser.
@_date: 2013-04-30 11:48:35
But is there a conversion rate? IIRC the bitcoin network has a hash rate of 11 THash/s yet it also has 900 petaFLOPS.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:27:10
 What makes you think I don't know what I'm talking about?
@_date: 2013-08-03 00:45:57
Do you honestly think we're denying women the opportunity to buy bitcoins? It's not our fault there aren't many who buy them.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:26:07
I wonder if hardware wallets will solve this.
Edit: also what if you send money to the paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-06-25 22:09:56
Still?! Won't they still make some profit???
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:17:30
I don't understand, why are you selling passwords?
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:21:23
It's mostly a price thing. You're right that in BTC earned vs electricity price it will make a profit but will you really ever make back your 2 BTC with rising difficulty?
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:43:03
I highly doubt bitcoin will cause the collapse of the nation state.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:48:20
It also says you can get it through cydia.
@_date: 2013-08-06 04:53:11
You called us an immature sausage fest. Thereby blaming us for having mostly men. To which I responded that we are not denying women a place in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:04:40
Would you be able to transfer part of the wallet's funds or must you transfer all?
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:10:32
It's odd isn't it. The problem bitcoin was made to solve is bringing it down.
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:15:01
Yeah, I really hope they lower the price.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:46:47
Jailbreak power!
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:22:20
Are these always 1 BTC or does the amount vary? Anyway, I'd imagine it'd be difficult to input the whole private key. Isn't it like 256 characters or something?
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:07:21
I thought litecoins were made so that CPUs could have a chance? Also doesn't pool mining/litecoins take care of the motherboard frying problem anyway? So all in all, should I give up on mining bitcoins/litecoins until I can get a good gpu or asic?
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:02:29
If I saw a store that accepted bitcoin I'd shop there just to see how it worked.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:55:25
Wait they can do whatever they want with my computer? How would they do that? And how do they hide it?
@_date: 2013-05-11 21:56:37
Umm Prometheus is a Greek Titan, not an Alien.
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:42:39
How so?
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:42:25
Put it on cydia, Apple won't let you do squat.
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:04:20
How can I buy them from btcguild and is it individual?
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:15:02
Really? I thought it was pretty basic. What were you referring to?
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:50:32
I thought it was 0.89 BTC. Did the price go up?
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:47:30
I just want that ASICMiner USB thing.
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:57:04
The answer is that people have all agreed to use it. The same reason bitcoin has value.
@_date: 2013-06-09 01:01:57
No I meant keep what we have now.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:35:48
It's funny how these companies restrict how users can spend their money and then are surprised when we seek alternatives. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:26:35
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:42:32
Our whole idea is based on the fact that a decentralized system is superior because a central authority can be attacked easily. I find it odd how we're so willing to accept a central exchange that *is* attacked easily.
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:39:58
Oh ok, that makes sense. Seems like a pretty cool service actually.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:06:25
I can't wait to randomly do this to people in other relevant threads. Now to just get some bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:43:58
but the exchange isn't, meaning we're open to attack.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:09:51
This could become problematic. It makes it more and more difficult for a decentralized peer system to exist. Now, it seems only large organizations will have a significant share in bitcoin's hash power.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:43:28


@_date: 2013-04-14 21:57:48
I'm just trying to figure out the mindset of these people.
@_date: 2013-05-19 14:12:54
How would you get an average of anonymous and non-cataloged transactions?
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:10:14
I'd recommend a hardware wallet like the Trezor.
@_date: 2013-06-01 22:10:19
What's that?
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:01:47
How do these botnets infect people anyway? Is there any way to avoid it?
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:46:33
Is KnCMiner legit? 400GH/s seems like a large claim.
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:42:35
People would just start comment spamming in hopes of getting more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:49:13
$10000?!??!! I thought it was $1299?!
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:14:01
It would be better to not have one easily targetable website that can be compromised. By doing that we are essentially tying the value of bitcoin to a centralized entity.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:02:52
I'm still confused as to the process. I'm guessing it's easy enough for them to run a Trojan on your computer or something but is that automatically linked to their address? So theoretically someone could just install something on my pc and I'd be mining bitcoins for them? And is this undetectable?
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:34:46
You would not imagine how hard I've been trying to get that potato to work.
