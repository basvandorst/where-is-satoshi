Not a lot. I have about 0.25 coin you reduce risk through dollar cost averaging over time instead of trying to time the market. But that only applies if you are planning to hold for awhile. If youre looking to "get rich quick" dump your money into it now and hope it keeps climbing.

I learned about it back in 2011, have some in a long lost wallet somewhere. But I finally bought last week when it was around 2800.  I was nervous because it still seemed high then. Glad I did though a week later!

Youre not going to make a lot of money off $100 in the near future off bitcoin or any other investment. Youre young and have the opportunity to hold for a long time. 
Worst case you lose $100 but that's why you dont invest money you need. That's gambling. 
But consider you are asking in a sibrrddit focused on the coin. Even skeptics here have invested before so there is a bias in your responses.

I think it is still early, but if you have known about it it is easy to think it is late in the game. I knew about it when it was around $2-3/coin, so based on my knowledge this is late in the game. 
But imagine someone just now getting in, they see its growth over the past few years and must think it,is still early as it will keep growing over the next few years. To them it is a great opportunity. You need to keep this perspective in mind because you can invest now, you cant change your past behavior though.

2800 was my first, then at 3200, 3600, 4000, and ill buy at 4400 too

Here is my quick mock up that is very bad (I am not a designer for a living)
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:38:22
I remember the first run to 10k. It was so monumental. I've been in this space so long. Everyone was hyped. The market has shaken out the weak investors and traders. My friends who bought at 15k don't even watch anymore. When I told them we were pushing 10k, they had no idea. 
This is different. It feels real this time.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:41:15
Much better than my shitty design

8% to 401(k) to get full employer match 
8% to bitcoin
I'm 25. I've put 8% into my 401k since 22. I've put 8% into bitcoin since July.   
Bitcoin is approaching 50% of my portfolio that took 3 years to build, in 4 months. 
Thanks bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:52:38
Yeah I feel that, at least you accept bitcoin on your site and aren't linking to like some obscure amazon posting.

I havent paid cash for travel in years thanks to credit cards. This year includes hawaii, Colorado, DC, aruba. Next year Maldives and probably Hong kong on some premium first class options (etihad for Maldives cathay pacific for HK).  
I use credit card sign on bonuses and,other methods to get a significant amount of frrquent flier miles and travel award points.

Even not being a full time HODLer, here is why I love this dip:
A few weeks ago we saw it pushing $5,000. I bought more BTC on this dip, and am selling 80% around $5k to cover the costs. Essentially, getting 20% of the BTC for free. 
If it starts going higher quick, I may just HODL past $5,000. But even if it stagnates there again, I still get to sell and get the benefit of lowering my dollar-cost average, since now I have bitcoin that I bought for essentially $0.
Why am I not just HODLing everything from the dip? I would, except I have a wedding coming up in about 6 months. I am leveraging our savings to buy more crypto right now. And unfortunately none of my vendors accepts BTC. My fiancee fully supports this plan, so the least I can do is make sure we have enough fiat when the time comes to pay for our wedding.

Like many I knew about bitcoin for years but never took the plunge way back when. It kept popping up, and now that I am out of school and working I had some extra cash that I wanted to invest so I decided to jump in July of this year. Been buying a bit every so often since then. I've managed to use DCA and other techniques to get my average cost to around $3,400. Currently sitting on 1.3 and waiting to get paid to buy a little more. 
I do try to time the market though. When I see a dip, if I don't have the cash I buy some through coinbase with a credit card. The fees suck, but I wait until I think it has peaked and sell enough to cover the costs. Usually gaining about 10-15% "free" bitcoin of my initial purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:45:31
That's the plan is to keep Hodling. I also liquidated some alts so I finally hit 1 btc!
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:43:55
Yeah it may not work out, if not in the short term that's alright. We believe in it long term and can hodl and save the extra needed cash 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:12:40
A measley ~15% gain is no reason to sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:50:03
I bought at 2700. I still have "i should have bought more then.." And "I should have bought the dip more." 
It will never end. Just keep buying.

5% each week you get paid still is just t% of your income monthly. It isn't compounding. 
If youre interested in more analysis, head over to I like the optimism of this sub, but there's good analysis and you can learn a lot over there if you want to actively trade. It can be done profitably, but learning how is key. Pay attention to popular people over there and learn what theyre talking about and how to analyze things properly to do it correctly. Youll likely still have bad trades though, but it is possible if that's where your interest is. 
That being said, holding likely will still be more profitable. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:22:32
I have been around since 2011, and even if you did believe it like I did, you likely would have cashed out once your value tripled. Most dont have the balls to HODL forever, especially on such a new tech
