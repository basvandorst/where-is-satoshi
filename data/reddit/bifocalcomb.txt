Hurts local economies? You literally just heavily implied you're better off shopping there than elsewhere. Walmart didn't stop shopping at your local stores, you did. What does it mean to economize? Get the maximum amount of stuff, for the minimum price. If Walmart provides that, how does that not help the local economy? If you'd rather pay more for the same stuff somewhere else, do it. Blaming Walmart for your and other consumers' actions is so juvenile it hurts.

Sorry, I was just having a rough day.. the reason why that's not true is that the algorithms are different. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, and ethereum uses ethash. Ethash is a much more memory intensive algorithm than SHA-256, so it's currently prohibitively expensive to design and produce ASICS that hash it. It's possible, but the performance gains would be very tame indeed in comparison to the gains you get when you upgrade from cpu to ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) SHA-256 machines. So Asics exist for sha-256 and hash super super fast, and Asics don't exist for eth and even if they did, they wouldn't get as many hashes per second as the BTC ones, not even close. Gpus mine eth, machines that are literally not capable of anything else mine BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-14 02:23:21
It's not a point. It's a retarded statement. You obviously can't compare raw numbers of hashes for different algorithms and conclude that the one is way less secure than the other cuz the number is lower. If that were not so, and this guy was correct, ethereum would already have been 51% attacked, cuz you'd need like 5 Asics to do it.  OBVIOUSLY you couldn't do that. Soooo obviously. If he thought for 3 seconds before posting that he probably wouldn't have. That's like thinking a stock's market cap is low because it's $1 a share without taking into account number of shares. It hardly warrants a refutation, but since you specifically asked, there you go.

It must provide more value than other shops in his area or he wouldn't continue to shop there. I'm trying to get him to understand that what's good for the consumer is good. The whole point of Walmart existing is to provide those cheap products, not provide employment at a wage arbitrarily chosen by outsiders. If he truly believed in high wages for workers, he'd pay the commensurately higher prices. There are always trade-offs. But it's not up to Walmart who gives them money. To blame Walmart for people preferring cheap things, and thus choosing Walmart for shopping, means you're placing all the blame on Walmart for your own actions. It's not a moral decision, imo. As far as I'm aware Walmart doesn't enslave anyone and so all the jobs they provide are occupied voluntarily.

Value, with this definition: the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.
Is what we're talking about) that exists independent of any possible subjective-use value and I'll give you $10 in BCH. Even if you're wrong. As long as it's decently coherent and I can't pick it apart immediately you get the $10.

How can its value increase ad infinitum at a rate such that it would not be economical to make any investments other than hold cash? Do you understand what this would require of the rate of production? The rate of production is increasing so rapidly that literally nobody can compete with whoever is producing anything. So, ya know, the economy would be at an impossible level of output in like 2 years. That's how it would thrive lol. Unless you mean people would randomly demand money for no reason to their own detriment and literally kill themselves trying to wait an extra day so they can get 1.0062 pounds of apples with a dollar instead of just 1? Then yea, that would be pretty bad. But I don't think people would just randomly start to value money so highly that they'd starve themselves, or stop all other consumption or investment spending. If they literally could not get a better return investing rather than holding cash that would either mean something is very structurally wrong, like a government is fucking something up, everyone became retarded overnight, or there is literally so little anyone could do that's useful that isn't already being done that they would actually slow down production by investing, meaning the economy is at its maximum productive capacity and nobody has any ideas on how to do literally anything better or make anything new.
@_date: 2018-11-07 19:38:38
Oh it is? So removed from any use, it will be valuable still. Im not sure if you understand what you're saying, but that's what that means. In that case, would you like to buy some gold in the Andromeda galaxy at 10% off spot from me? It's a great deal, objectively.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:27:45
He's right. How else do you think they get 3x bear/bull funds? They can't just buy 3x the underlying. A lot of etfs actually don't own any of the underlying, and it's fine, because as an ETF, distinct from futures, you can never accept delivery of physical gold. They just track the price, usually using a bunch of derivatives.

Now you are saying that gold in the Andromeda galaxy is valuable to everyone. It is objectively valuable, you're saying. It is true from any perspective.


Wait so gold that can't be used isn't valuable? It's only valuable as long as you can use it... Which means.. It's not objectively valuable. If it were objectively valuable, it would be valuable to someone with no use for it! Do you understand what I'm saying?

Literally the exact same concept. Disregarding something someone did because they use a pseudonym.

@_date: 2018-11-07 18:01:05


Please stop espousing economic fallacies. People are impressionable, especially in this sub. NOTHING HAS INHERENT VALUE. At all, ever. No matter what. There is no floor to the value of gold because it is made of gold atoms. That makes no sense at all. If gold were exactly the same as it is now, but people thought it was ugly and useless, it would be worthless. Value is based entirely on the subjective judgments of individuals. There is no objective or fundamental or inherent value of anything. Everything has subjective use-value and that's the only type of value anything has. Price is a separate concept. Value is what you get out of it, price is what you have to give up for it. 


It has no use, except literally the reason it was invented, eh? Lol. Do you mean it doesn't have an industrial application? Why is that a material observation? Plenty of things that don't have industrial uses are useful. You seem to arbitrarily drawing the line between what you think has "fundamental value" and what doesn't based on whether it's a physical thing. Why? Explain why that's not arbitrary.

That's not how this works.. They'd default or inflate.

They already spend 40% of gdp, there's no room for anything besides inflation or default at 7%. Even at 3-4% they can't collect enough taxes to pay. They won't pay it's just a matter of how are they going not to, and when will everyone realize they're not going to.

Yea a sure sign I'm bullshitting is absolutely destroying your arguments after you begin the ad hominems and cry about being insulted. My main point is if we remove usefulness, which you don't seem to think has any bearing on a certain portion of the value of something, it will have no value, which you don't seem able to admit because you think it's fine to assume that all the gold in the universe is accessible. Doesn't the fact that for your argument to be true, that there is some value in gold or any good that transcends its uses, that people would realistically pay for gold they have no chance of ever using kinda throw up a red flag that maybe something is wrong with your reasoning? You do know people don't actually buy and sell gold they have no chance of using, right? Or no? Anyway, something to think about. I don't expect you to reply, just please understand where value comes from. Theories of objective value are all very outdated and thoroughly refuted.
Now Lets Just try One More time:
Me: So there is no intrinsic value of anything.


Me: Now you are saying that gold in the Andromeda galaxy is valuable to everyone.


You are literally proving my point right here.
So chemical and physical properties are its value, but it only has those chemical and physical properties on earth if it costs less to transport it here than you could sell it for? Now, please, understand that I am trying to educate, but it's difficult sometimes because I start from the same point every time. So which is it? Does "chemical property" fit this definition: the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something? Or maybe objective value is a vicious notion begat by some observation and simplistic reasoning like 500 years ago.

@_date: 2019-01-07 20:01:35
I am optimistic in the long term. Short term pain will necessitate drastic changes to economies everywhere, largely removing inefficient government from the flow of goods and services and even finance, but that short term pain will have to get pretty bad before people lose faith in their governments. I do hope a leftist Trump type gets elected though, because that would help a lot to delegitimize the authority of government from the perspective of both sides.
And yea, libertarian movements are picking up all over the world. Surprisingly, especially in Brazil, a significant portion of people are legit ancaps. Imo it will take the collapse of a first world government to usher in any sort of voluntary society. Seasteads won't be practical until they have allies on land, imo. Third world people (No offense, but it's simply a fact) are generally not bright enough to value cooperation over the smash and grab mentality prevalent in any low IQ society, so their lack of government doesn't foster any sort of voluntary institutions to replace the actual necessary functions government does serve. See Somalia. If the government of Sweden, however, slowly started to crumble because people voluntarily arranged for the production of the useful things it does without having to pay for the useless, it's not too difficult to see how, for instance, loss of confidence in the central bank might lead to adoption of sound money by the public, thereby constraining the spending power of government to what they explicitly take from people, almost certainly causing lots of programs to be underfunded and therefore doubly shitty, making it worth it for the first time in Sweden for a decent amount of people to pay for something they already pay taxes for. And it's unlikely many will want to continue to pay taxes for something when they not only don't need to understand economics and imagine how whichever industry might be run privately, but they can simply observe and see firsthand the results markets make possible. What paths to freedom do you see?
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:19:53
By and large, they do not. Otherwise there would not exist fiat currencies at all. The record of history is chock-full of great inflations, and still people are swindled into fiat. Of course, a small minority of people will see the patterns repeat themselves. But interacting with people from outside of where I grew up it is hard to imagine that over half of people even possess the mental capabilities to recognize patterns of action rather than simply repeating labels they hear for certain groups, like libertarians. Racist, bigot, misogynist, etc. When people don't even really know what they oppose it's very hard to get them to support the right things. Especially when most of what people who don't seek out information for themselves hear as news reinforces their incorrect beliefs, and since everyone says the same things on TV, everyone else is obviously crazy or retarded. Authority factors into the equation of trust far too heavily in the minds of most people for them to believe actual facts over their favorite, familiar talking heads. Most people probably never even began to learn how to think for themselves, because in general it makes getting through government schools more onerous than it already is. Fitting into the mold is what's taught to kids and ingrained in their parents' minds. Isn't it better to have your kid follow the rules so you don't get called about him refusing to glue macaroni to a piece of paper? Most parents don't see the harm in forcing kids to do entirely useless tasks just because someone says they have to. 
The status quo holds a very strong allure for a reason; generally when things aren't too heinous, you're doing things somewhat correctly. The issue now is that people don't understand that the status quo is unsustainable because only crazy idiots, according to MSNPC and other such news outlets, believe there's anything wrong with an economy that puts up stats like ours is right now. Anyone who doesn't say things they feel comfortable with based on things people say who they "trust", (largely, imo, only because they don't want to believe that such scumbags hold so much power over them) is dangerous and a threat to the status quo, which isn't perfect, they say, but is obviously better (based on nothing) than what people who aren't even on TV propose. After all, if their ideas are so good, why can't they convince any countries to adopt their radical laissez-faire policies? Politicians are there to help us, so if they say it's bad it must be bad for us. It's easier to do what you're told to do and believe what you're told to believe, in short, than to act or think.

I am thankful. I think cryptos have a shot at saving the world from turning into what the USSR wanted to be. I just hope enough people get on-boarded before capital controls are implemented to try to prop up the dying fiat currencies. 
Unfortunately, most people won't even try to adopt crypto till they've already needed to for some time. They won't know they should till it's obvious. The sovereign debt/fiat currency bubble is no different in principle from any other bubble.

Well all right, I do understand the scaling point, but bitcoin is not anonymous even with tumblers and whatnot. That's what I was saying read about.

The natural deflation of the market counteracts the monetary inflation to some extent, but it's not the raw materials that cost so much more necessarily, because those are often obtained abroad where the dollar commands more value, but I encourage you to look at actual prices of goods historically and compare it to the official rate of inflation. Probably from 1995-2010 you'll want to look at.

That's simply not true. Bitcoin is transparent by design.

Strange how socialism inevitably breeds institutionalized corruption... Wait actually it makes perfect sense. Lol. When the government is in charge of production, people can only get what they bribe a politician for. Why would a politician direct resources to people who haven't paid him? He has nothing to gain from that, and so will even withhold goods from the public until they are willing to pay very dearly. Contrast this with private ownership, where businesses are scrambling to provide everything people want at lower prices than their competitors. It's no wonder socialist governments are and always have been extremely corrupt. They hold monopolies not only on force but on pretty much everything else too. They have 0 accountability.

So you envision bitcoin as an everyday payment scheme? Are there any plans to include transactional privacy? I've heard that tumblers can be broken without too much cost.

CPI is a horrible, horrible, and extremely inaccurate way to measure price inflation. Guess what percentage of CPI is accounted for by healthcare, which for many American families is their biggest cost?
I'll just tell you - it's 1%. They game the system to allow them to pretty much lie about how much prices have moved up. They can even substitute goods for one another, provided that some bureaucrat deems the items sufficiently similar. This includes counting ground beef as steak.

The Constitution nowhere permits the federal government to make it illegal NOT to buy something. The way they got around this was the penalty for not having obamacare was low, and in a 5-4 decision it was opined by the chief justice that the penalty was not so severe that everybody would be forced to buy health insurance, and therefore it is constitutional. Two years later, that penalty was raised to the point that it was cheaper to buy health insurance. 
Where in the Constitution does it say that the power to secure borders is limited by the ethnicity of those prospective immigrants? It doesn't matter if it's "racist" or not, the federal government has the power to not let whoever it doesn't want into the country. Please show me in the Constitution where it states only that all people of the world have the rights granted herein. It does not. All citizens of the United states are given those rights, so to say that something is unconstitutional because it "violates constitutional rights" of non-citizens is absurd.

Permanent US residents are not citizens. Their rights are not protected under the Constitution. 
I do agree Saudi Arabia is by far the most heinous aggressor and sponsor of terrorism, probably in the whole world besides the US, and it's bizarre to me that people blindly support their ongoing genocide because we're "allies". 
I think the entire issue of Constitutionality is moot because  as a "living document" its words are about as binding as a high five from some guy on the street who promised you a slushie next week. What was considered unthinkable by the founding fathers is now commonplace. 
There is no enforcement mechanism. There is one government, which derives its income from one source. Therefore interests between the three branches are very closely aligned; there is no material incentive for a judge to rule against his employer to counteract the obvious one in favor of government, and thus the usurpation of power has steadily continued since 1860. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:02:50
Who appoints those judges? Do you think they'd appoint someone who would rule against their own interest? I'm not arguing that the interpretation IS literal, but if it's not there are no bounds on what the Constitution might be taken to say. How could selective service be enacted after the 14th amendment? It is clearly unconstitutional. And you might argue that it was necessary at whatever point in time, but with each overstepping of the limits set out in the Constitution it holds less restraint over the massive power of the state. Hence in 1870 the federal government spent about 0.6% of GDP, and last year we were right around 40%. Where does it end? Well, if we keep going the direction we have been, and there's absolutely no reason to think that won't happen, we'll end up like Spain or Portugal or Greece, but with a dollar crisis that will supplant the US as THE world economic power. Do a  remind me for 5 years from now, so i can brag to you then.
Also interpretation of a specific law in a certain case does not invalidate my point that a constitution issue only worth as much as it is able to resist change. If it can't, again, there is no point in having it in the first place, because it will be stepped on anyway.

Oh my god you absolute idiot.


THIS IS NOT WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. Holy shit are you literally trolling? Did you check my comment history and try to present yourself in as stupid a way as you could conceive? How can people actually think properties are the same as value? Literally every single fucking time someone thinks something has inherent value and I say no it doesn't because it's only value is being used, then they say Oh well actually the properties are what makes it valuable. THIS IS SO OBVIOUSLY FALSE. How much gold do you want from the Andromeda galaxy? It has the same properties as the gold on earth. The exact same. Literally could not be more similar if it tried. Why don't people pay for gold in the Andromeda galaxy if it has literally any value whatsoever to anyone? Wanna know why? Because it doesn't. Because it can't be used, so it cannot. Do you understand? Things can only have value when someone is there to value them. Something could have all the properties in the world, and it wouldn't matter if no one had a use for it. It still wouldn't be worth anything. 
"There is no gold that's not usable"
Lol you fucking retard what do you think I mean by usable? Usable in 35,000 years? God.
Yea gold has value because its properties make it useful. Bitcoin has value also because it's properties make it useful. Neither of them nor anything that exists or has ever existed in this or any other realm or universe or dimension is worth anything intrinsically. I am seriously not comprehending how you don't understand this. You are literally arguing against your own point at the end, so I'm not sure you are either. 


What the hell are you doing in a crypto sub? Go back to like illustrated conceptual econ basics with the wiggles or something. Jesus christ. 


Value, n. 
the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.
No, they are not its value, for the last time. Value has absolutely nothing to do with whether you can remove properties of something.

I can't get a gun where I live.

Pretty much nothing the government does today is constitutional that it didn't do at its advent, if we're adhering strictly to the words of the document, which is obviously how the founders meant it to be. If they wanted people to "interpret" the Constitution, they wouldn't have explicitly spelled out the powers of the federal government. They would have drawn a picture or something.

If not the written words on the Constitution itself, what? Whatever a politician wants?

Well, you're probably right, at least within the next 15-20 years, but I think over time people will realize the superfluousness of a monopoly on force when all associations can so easily be made contractual and therefore voluntary instead of coerced. At least, I hope they will.

You really think that if they could have gotten a conviction, that they'd just be like nah whatever? They wanted to make an example of of him. They did, but convicting him of hiring people to murder other people would have disqualified him as any sort of libertarian, and he wouldn't be respected or looked favorably upon even by them.

Member the 70's? I member.
Unemployment is a sham of a statistic because it counts people who are opting to take welfare over getting a job or part time workers as not part of the workforce or employed.. DOW 20k means the economy is healthy? Smh. If you define inflation as price inflation, sure it's been low so far, but that's only because prices should have dropped significantly. They haven't been allowed to due to the massive increases in money supply. Just because prices haven't risen yet does not mean they're not going to. Monetary inflation always feels good in the beginning, but never ends well. Just ask Germany. Or Zimbabwe. Or holders of Greenbacks during the colonial period.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:09:06
Whaaat? Never heard of it being used like that can you tell me more?
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:23:23
That logic is entirely spurious. 
Why would there never be hyperinflation because people have been saying there will be for 20 years?
I pay no heed to what other people say. Look at what is going on in the world! ZIRP and unprecedented asset purchase programs the past 7 years will absolutely bring about price inflation. The fact that prices don't go up so drastically normally is a result of an economy's output almost being able to keep up with the new amount of dollars. Recently, the economy has not been able to keep up. Not even close. There's a reason this recovery is being called the weakest on record, and that is because the economy is still very weak! 0% interest rates weren't even enough to push growth past 4%, which in the past has been about average for a recovery. The amount of capital in the US as compared to debt is ridiculously low as well. This is a result of consumers spending money they don't own, which in the short term makes things look good. In the long term, everything has to be paid for. And it will be. If you can't see that you deserve to be blindsided because it's beyond obvious at this point.
Do you remember in 2005 when everyone was calling anyone pointing to the obvious bubble in housing crazy or stupid? "Housing will ALWAYS go up!"
I remember.

Right because bubbles don't exist and everything is priced properly.
Actually, we're in a huge dollar bubble. When that starts collapsing the "crack-up boom" into real money and hard assets will also start. Do you really think 7 years of ZIRP and a $4.5 trillion Fed balance sheet are just gonna unwind nicely?

Quantum entanglement bruh
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:31:02
It's absolutely comparable. It's not the same, but nothing is ever the same as anything else. We are printing more and more money each year to repay money that would otherwise not be able to be repaid.. When you're printing money because that's the only way to make good on debt obligations, you've got a serious problem that's gonna end either with serious tax hikes and a big recession, or your currency becoming worthless. A trillion dollars the US could repay with printed money without its currency going to 0, but $21 trillion? I don't see that as feasible in any way. And I highly doubt the Fed would let our economy slip into recession, and I highly doubt anyone is in favor of higher taxes. Massive price inflation is coming for sure.

Uh what? Why does it matter if it's $0.25.... Are bitcoins suddenly indivisible or something 
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:03:16
.... Are you trolling or what.. In the event that you're not, you don't measure a coin's value by the price you pay for its unit of account. Just like you don't measure your net worth by the average value of your possessions. Look at the market cap. It's $0.25 a coin, but there are waaaay more XRP than BTC. If XRP grew to $10 a coin, it would be more valuable than all the other cryptos combined today, and probably almost at the top even in 5 years. Why is this likely? Bitcoin could easily split into smaller denominations so that each coin is worth $0.25. Then would it be likely that it increases the same percentage you think Ripple will? The answer is it is equally likely regardless of what the unit of account is. I mean I guess people like you will just throw money at coins with massive supply which might help their price but other than that there's no reason to buy a coin over another based on price of a single coin alone. Ever.
