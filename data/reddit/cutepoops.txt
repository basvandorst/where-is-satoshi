you come over as a wanna be smart guy, but here you go:
kraken gives you a short window to cancel withdrawal requests. because kraken is currently total garbage, after canceling the withdrawal request, your funds will not be credited back to your balance sheet. this is either a UI issue or they really really messed up big time.
my advise to everyone still is: STAY AWAY FROM KRAKEN.
even if they eventually rolllout a fix.. they are totally unprofessional and do NOT deserve your money.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:46:30
do NOT try to use your own crypto libraries. this is literally crying for problems.
also you seem to misunderstand the most basic aspects of key derivation. 
hint: the priv key is a 256bit string.. something something sha256

december 17 - for realz, even confirmed it

I told all my friends to leave this exchange and the last few doubting did it once cancelling withdrawals made funds disappear.

btc will hit 4k € anytime soon. as with all major milestones a correction will follow.
wait for the correction and buy then.

u confuse pubkey with address
exposing the pubkey leaves u vulnerable to quantum attacks
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:36:46
yes, the people are poor, but the gov receives direct support from ru and cn.. this way they indirectly attack the west while staying in the shadows and keeping a somewhat normal public reputation.
did you know that the most advanced fake us currency ("the superdollar") is being made in nk? No halfway intelligent person would believe they were able to get this far on their own.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:39:01
no and I figured that many people may have difficulties connecting the dots. hence I tried to put it all in this post. feel free to share :)

he stated he was presented cryptogrpahic proof - a signature from an early block priv key. 
in cryptography you dont get duped my friend. he deliberately mislead people with his statement.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:23:10

those comments are usually form monkey kids who bought 5$ worth of btc and think they are cool
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:38:58
you are absolutely correct and this is why only a (mutuated) sig was posted without the preimage/message itself.
unfortunately there are way too many morons out there who will shit their pants now.
