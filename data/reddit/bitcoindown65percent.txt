Highly unlikely, I believe the court has already said they plan to go ahead with the liquidation. Bitcoiners are living on a hope now. Not that the alternative would make much difference to the end outcome anyway.

Easy as fuck to get your shitcoins stolen even if its stored in a private wallet on your computer (I.e. malware)
All transactions and balances are completely visible and thus anything you do can be tracked in real time (I.e. like Ulbricht's current problem). Its Big Brother's wet dream.


A network that can take days or even *forever* to complete a transfer, and has a decreasing number of nodes to keep it alive.
Even Andreas Antonopoopos admits that all transactions could turn out to be fraudulent, as 'confirmations' just increase probability of legitimacy, but it can never be confirmed 100% as legitimate.
It usually takes an hour or longer to get at least 6 'confirmations', which is at least a decent probability of not being double-spent, but here's the rub: That 6 confirmations assume that an attacker has less than 10% of the network hash rate. The largest pools have ~25-45% of the network hash rate, making relying on 6 confirmations grossly unsafe.


There's the transaction fee, which is already substantial enough to deter micro transactions, but worse - it has to increase drastically in the future to compensate miners for decreasing block rewards.
Also its very rare to have someone you automatically trust in a transaction, so usually you have to use Escrow, which is typically ~1% + fixed fee, making it comparable almost to PayPal.
Merchants also have to pay percentage or fixed fees for services like Bitpay, and whether it be merchant or consumer, if they want to convert Bitcoin to fiat or vice-versa they have to pay hefty exchange fees (the cheapest are typically the most risky, I.e. Mtgox).

You'll notice that in the post I wrote 'or once it reaches there [the open market] which it inevitably will'
Who the fuck is going to buy $90 million worth of Bitcoins and hold on to them? I'd be surprised if you can even find a buyer for that amount.

I've been doing the math on your Bitcoin gambles over time, and Ive come to the conclusion that you've put ~$20k into Bitcoin but have only withdrew $~16k for a downpayment on an 18-year-old car
Is this correct? By my calculations, you should be presently down ~$3,400 because you gambled a second time on shitcoins
