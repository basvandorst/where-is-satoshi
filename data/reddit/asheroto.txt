I'd recommended diversifying your portfolio of cryptocurrency. Putting all your eggs in one basket is pretty risky.

localbitcoin.com is probably your best bet.

If you live in the US you can use the cash app it's probably the easiest and fastest

Are you in the US? if so, Cash App is the cheapest and easiest, then managing your funds with Exodus Wallet is safer than Coinbase.

LastPass has a feature where you can designate someone to have full access to your account if they request it, wait X days, without you canceling it. You could put your private keys and such as a note in there.
Facebook let's you designate a "legacy contact" too.

Many small towns in America have businesses that only accept cash.  Unfortunately for me it's my favorite burger joint!  I wish businesses would start accepting BTC/ETH/LTC/XMR.

I've received that identical email before, too!
