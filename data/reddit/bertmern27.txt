To try and stimulate demand. Imagine you have 50 cups of lemonade and none are selling. You could refuse to make them cheaper, but you're screwing yourself in this situation. Not every situation is like this, its more difficult for businesses that focus completely on sales versus production or augmentation.

It does. Think of it this way. In a real life "pull" a stranger comes to your house to get data. In a "push" you're sending a letter to the stranger. This isn't a perfect analogy, but the actual software architecture of cards is what leaves them so vulnerable. Sure the flaws could be fixed, but good luck with that. Assuring a security standard for that many systems and all their competitors would require smart regulation or smart consumers. Good luck.
And Mt. Gox was a joke. They began as a MTG card seller, transactions were excruciatingly slow, and their prices were suspicious.

Maybe you should read that article. Push and pull are http requests. One sends and the other requests. Credit cards give you many "attack surfaces", or extra layers of requests that are relatively vulnerable. 
" The card reader is hooked up to a point of sale system which communicates that data to a server in a back room. That server sends the card data to a merchant services company – usually just a reseller for a slightly larger merchant services company and so on up – and the merchant services company sends it to the issuing bank (your bank) who authorizes (or not) the purchase. When money actually moves, it moves through that entire chain in reverse plus an extra hop at the end for the merchant’s bank – each link taking their cut off the top."
Tl;dr: middle manning pulled data is a serious threat to security, and not the greatest deal for consumers

Good thing all wallet passwords are kept in a database with ss and mothers maiden names /s
The idea of using pull for finance hurts me physically. This vaguely explains if you dont know any computer science. 
I'm on mobile, forgive my shit format link.
Don't talk about the security flaws of Bitcoin if you don't understand that they are in every way (excepting costumer protections) an improvement on the card system.

 With pull they reach into a database full of your sensitive data, with push you send some data. By using so many pull requests you give hackers an equal number of attack sites. They'll naturally seek the one with the easiest security and work from that foothold.

From what i can understand the Winklevi can't discuss any details until the ETF is finished with some legal process. I could be wrong, so don't quote me.

I spend with bitcoin then buy the coin back. It seems counter-intuitive, but the reality is when I'm saving 5% with bitcoin why wouldnt I? 
I'm the first go to not pinch his pennies, but 5% is too many pennies to just leave them all over the place.

Good thing the ruble is only 4 years old. I'm also glad it had an increase of 400-500% before it hyper-inflated. Otherwise you'd look like a real jaded troll. Oh wait..

I'm wondering if you could make your purchases when prices are higher than when you bought the coins in the first place to get a relative discount. Of course this might be a taxable capital gain but it still seems worth it.

I'm not sure how they manage to sustain it, I think maybe they kinda play the market on top of having the person buy at a premium.

So don't save money. I've used it a few times at 40%, and it really only adds about a day to Amazon's processing/delivery.
I can dig through my accounts to see if I have some transaction history if you want some proof, but honestly it's much neater in practice than it might sound.

Purse has temporarily allowed a 50% discount rate so I think this might be the reason that Bitcoin books are all the rage right now on Amazon specifically.
