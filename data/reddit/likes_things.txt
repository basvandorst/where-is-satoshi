Oh, I must have misread your earlier post. Yes, the parent is confirmed. Thanks for clearing that up. Bitcoin is fascinating and I'm happy I learned something new about the technology today.

Thanks. Yes, the fees I used satisfy the formula, so that's why it must have worked. The child transaction still hasn't gone through, so I'll move everything to a different address just to be sure I'll end up with two transactions to the same recipient by accident.

Sorry if I was unclear. I cannot use "replace by fee" on the first transaction, I get the error I linked to. I'm not sure exactly how "child pays for parent" works when I already *have* a child payment.

Thanks, I played around a little and found a solution. By increasing the fee of the first transaction even further (I used 0.5 mBTC), the transaction went through without an error message. The original transaction now says "double spend" at blocktrail.com and refers to the new transaction ID.
I'm curious to see if the second transaction will still go through (I doubt it because the output amount doesn't add up anymore) or if I have to do it again. I will wait a while but will post here with the results.
Thanks for your help!

Maybe my answer above can help. I increased the "replace by fee" of the parent transaction even further (up to 0.5 mBTC) and that seems to have solved the problem.
