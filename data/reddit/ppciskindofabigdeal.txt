it doesn't NEED a fee market,  but it DOES need to pay for itself and find a equilibrium between the cost of resources and the value of a permanent entry in the blockchain.  
I'm not a hardcore small blocker but these people who are just like "20mb blocks solves everything, jus t do it now"  are retarded,  all it does is make the whole thing even more unsustainable pie in the sky fiction 
(hint:  bitcoin is already extremely unsustainable even at current levels,  if it wasn't for the subsidy there would be no bitcoin)  
i personally think that eliminating fee pressure by opening up block sizes is the wrong move at this time,  fees do need to go up, as a matter of fact they should have never been lowered.
Bitcoin works and is as genius as it is because of natural market forces and equilibrium's,  any permanent solution should be based on the same concepts,  self-regulating or nothing.
The bandwidth issue is also very real,  no matter how many people scream "i have google fiber and can download the whole chain in 8 seconds"  that is not representative.
The only thing is i am not sure if the current motivation to keep blocks small is all some type of ploy for lightning network or blockstream or something..

Every story i ever read like this is with somebody using, coinbase, circle, blockchain,  or some other retarded app on their phone, where the bitcoin do not reside on the device and you are at the mercy of a 3rd party to complete the payment.
I've paid (in person) with Bitcoin for things a bunch of times,  using Bitcoin Wallet (Andreas Schildbach) and I have NEVER had a problem.
As a matter of fact,  (unfortunately)  usually the waiter or waitress is pleasantly surprised that my Bitcoin transactions actually work,  because they have a rather bad taste in their mouth from previous patrons who have no idea wtf is up.  (using some dumb wallet)
Circle, Coinbase, Blockchain,  you have the markets attention right now but you are screwing it up.

I've seen BTC go from s $2 to 4,  and $600 to $1200, and everything inbetween.   It wasn't really that different. 
We are in an entirely different world even from the Nov/ Dec 2013 bubble.  The times of $2 to $4 seem like a different freakin universe.
With the amount of money, and never even mind money,  just the amount of human capital and raw brain power being injected right now..  12 months out is going to look quite different again.

I'm not donating to any open source / tech organization that uses coinbase or bitpay / doesn't even try to pretend they are not converting instantly to fiat. 
These are exactly the organizations that should understand Bitcoin the best,  and it's great that they accept bitcoin and all but it's basically a farce.  
This is exactly why wikipedia didn't get my donation when they  started accepting bitcoin.  
Also during the ALS ice bucket challenge,  i was nominated and decided i would donate to ALS next year and donate to the EFF instead,  until i was greeted by some coinbase bullshit,  instantly killed my donation mojo.
Tech companies and organizations (especially community funded / open source)  wake the hell up.

as a linux user since 1996,  i whole-heartedly agree with this statement.  
back when i first learned about linux,  i got excited like only a few things in my life had done.  a decade and a half later,  bitcoin does it to me again.
i don't want to sound cliche because i know Andreas Antonopolous said the same thing and no i am not copying him we grew up in the same times..  
but for me,  in my life,  few things have ever given me this feeling,  and when i did "get it",  it was INSTANT and unmistakeable.  
these are:   
computers in general  (as a very young child)
modems (couple years after first computer exposure)
bbs's  / fidonet / other distributed messaging nets (right after modems)
pre www (compuserve,  suzy, gopher, irc)
www (mosaic, netscape)
linux (and freebsd at the time)
each one of those things to me is the same.  and each one of those things,  once i started i never stopped and never will,  they are all that important.  
people that went through these things and these thoughts,  are the true internet. pioneers of something the world has never seen before,  and they are doing it again.  
no one understood us then,  and no one understands us now,  but we are truly the unshakeable base. the people that "get it"  and there is nothing anyone can say that will convince us otherwise,  because they just don't get it yet.  they never did.

@_date: 2015-05-08 14:17:15
If they have blocked it, it may be due to their own policy. However gbtc is free trading there is no restrictions. Where the confusion comes in is if you want to buy into BIT in the primary market. That requires you to be a accredited investor and hold for 1 year. 
The secondary market (GBTC) has no such restrictions. You need to ask your broker why THEY are restricting you to buy gbtc when no such restriction exists on the security itself.

Maybe not as "raw materials" but the scarce resource is space in the blockchain.  It isn't as simple as just throwing unlimited bandwidth and hard drives at it, letting it rip, and pretending like it doesn't cost anything.
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:22:40
Agreed to both of those points,  block size will still have to go up at some point though and a dynamic fee alone does not address that..
With a dynamic block size based on fees the rationale is IF blocks are legitimately full of paying transactions,  these are 'good problems',  the network can pay the bill to propagate indefinitely...  A rising tide rises all boats,  if the small nodes want to continue to play they need to keep up and upgrade their internet, hard drive, mempool allocation, etc.  
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:02:41
Only until the market catches up.  It alleviates the "chaos" that Jeff is talking about,  but lets the network find its natural balance and maintain autonomy. 
Also it's a very rough solution,  i am not saying that it is THE solution but any solution proposed should be as easy to understand as this one.  It doesn't matter as much WHAT the rule is,  as long as it's self-calibrating and clearly published.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:21:44
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:22:26
Dropping the fees several times from 50k satoshis to 1k satoshis where we currently are got us in this mess.  
The users would be used to paying a reasonable fee for a legitimately scarce resource already if we didn't go bung everything up,  we wouldn't have this sticker shock issue as much anyway.
What bitcoin trades for against USD should be irrelevant when considering network fees.  The network has fixed costs in BITCOIN.
If the fees are too high for a business to succeed they need to relay their transactions through their own node or have an agreement with a node to process for cheaper.  
Real simple dynamic fee market,  when the total fees hit the block reward for 51% of the past 2016 blocks,  then the block size doubles until it hits the block reward again.   It should probably be able to adjust down as well like difficulty.  Bitcoin is very expensive to run and transactions are not free.  Yes this is an over simplification,  but the point is leave it up to a very clear equilibrium that everyone understands and the market will take care of the rest.   
Bitcoin's core design is based around equilibriums and this should be no different.  Arbitrary decisions like "oh lets drop the fee like crazy because bitcoin bubbled" or "8mb sounds good to the chinese!"  are just that,  arbitrary.  
You screw with the market and this is what you get.   Devs are bitching back and fourth about why so and so's idea will stifle adoption,  meanwhile the very discussion has stifled adoption significantly,  maybe more so than anything else in Bitcoin history.

Only thing i slightly disagree on is that we should have a plan for scaling up in a hurry if a bunch of new users show up,  pay legit fees, and fill blocks.  If our fee market gets out of control and basically no reasonable fee will yield the new users a fast confirm we have problems.
In the case of a legit bubble that could happen,  especially if we see Bitcoin used for capital flight in China for example,  which may be getting very real very soon.
I do not really buy into this whole notion of increasing the block size to whatever and letting what little fee pressure we have dwindle.   This network is very expensive to run and it needs to start paying it's own bills,  the sooner the better.

really?   let me tell you a little story
once upon a time i set a phone up on my gf's android phone and sent it some bits,  there the bits sat for a long while.
one day,  said gf was looking for something online on some random site,  she had decided she wanted to buy an item off the site,  and then to her surprise saw bitcoin at the checkout of said random site.
she then asked me how it works,  i said open your wallet and shoot that qr code on the screen with it,  she did it and the transaction was completed.  instant lightbulb moment, she was instantly sold and now wants to use bitcoin for everything she can. 
It is organic cases like these that we need.  You can preach and yell and jump up and down as much as you want that bitcoin is the best thing ever, but it will do almost nothing compared to what one random organic experience will.

* paypal = not an option
* 70% (at least) of visa / mastercard = not supported
* dozen other methods =  nope sorry,  a couple really shitty methods only
PS will continue to block US players AND enforce AML
Bitcoin is yet another payment method,  that is all.  Just so happens that in this case,  it is the BEST payment method for the job.

not in Canada.  which markets is it an option?
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:33:35
do it!
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:57:04
i know of my personal pain,  playing pokerstars for over 10 years and seeing it go from super easy to extremely difficult.
you are correct that i am not aware of the other major markets payment methods,  i am going to look into it.  
HOWEVER,  i somewhat have to assume based on previous experience that there will be some "catch"  to most of the "alternate" methods.  
if it was as easy as using any old visa,  there would not be a "zillion" options.   It's fees,  or shady shit,  or restrictions out the bazoo.

does it not already accept vouchers bought with bitcoin since launch?
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:53:55
deposits aren't really a concern 
the biggest concern is when pokerstars transmits money.  (cashes someone out)  
they have to follow AML and KYC  (or whatever it's called in Isle of Man)  
Their processes already exist for this.  There will be no anonymous bitcoin cash outs.  Instead of cutting a cheque they send a bitcoin tx.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:56:37
who cares they don't need em
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:38:34
sorry i didn't catch it was a question i guess.  
if you look a little harder into the "options"  you will see that none are really desirable.  
the echecks from your bank account are probably the option with the least friction,  but even that comes with its own problems.
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:07:16
yeah someone pointed that out to me today,  SOME countries can. Though myself and everyone i know that plays on pokerstars has never had paypal as an option.   Not sure what the deal is there.. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:44:24
right now if you cash out from pokerstars say via a cheque,  there is no tax withholding,  the onus is on you to report the income.  In some countries winnings aren't taxable at all (Canada for example) Bitcoin does not cloud that situation.
US players will still be banned just like they are now.  People go to great lengths (proxies, 3rd party payment services)  to get around it.  
Yes you would be able to deposit as there is no bank to prevent you from doing so.  Though again say in the case of US citizen,  you wouldn't be able to cash out..  bitcoin withdrawals would still be subject to AML.  (larger ones anyways,  i don't think they have to enforce amounts like $200 or something)
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:37:57
ugh i forgot about the 30k seized in the original take down as someone pointed out (not dpr's personal stash)  
yes another 40k coming
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:14:49
seals is cool and all,  but there is like a handful of tables going even while its busy,  no tourneys,  definitely no tourneys worth actually playing.
pokerstars is the worlds best poker site..  call it the network effect if you will..
i have personally tried playing on seals and have shown other avid poker players and they are just like screw this give me pokerstars.  they are not really concerned with the anonymity of it.
(also pokerstars is pretty much anonymous until you have to cash out)
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:40:42
didn't they also use to show the days destroyed per block..  i don't see it now?
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:18:44
edit: see replies,  another 40k
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:01:20
it was never about mining.. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:17:56
what good reason could they have for that..  is a bunch of old btc moving? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:39:24
chokepoint is "over"
banks are already pretty hostile against btc..  they can't push too hard though,  everyone has their own limits until they snap and start pushing back. 
banks already don't want to be involved in poker so nothing changes there.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:17:25
i do like NSR,  but this post is just silly
it's not 6th on CMC that was some kind of error
and the "240 btc buy wall"  is not really a wall and is spread out under the market..  
you're better than this ccedk
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:22:07
i think you'd either have to be working directly on the project,  or part of the executive team to know about it..
pokerstars is a big operation.. there are a lot of people that don't need to know
@_date: 2016-07-10 03:32:09
it's 100% true..  people don't know this because thinking about it would cut into their reality tv watching time.. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:00:37
can you fund on the fly? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:31:48
as far as i'm concerned cashing out bitcoin is mandatory,  they will still have to follow AML,  no change there
agreed.  take the time,  get it right.
@_date: 2016-07-10 03:35:23
I would agree with you,  if any regular person with a lot of money / resources could open a bank. (and actually have any chance in hell)
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:43:13
still true..  it's all signatures, multiple data points to examine vs 1 or none.. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:18:05
i'm not breaking the law in my country when i play poker or use bitcoin,  not sure how it works in austrailia if thats where you're from.
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:35:55
debit or visa/mc?   if i can use it on pokerstars might be interested..  
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:19:44
you can do echecks but i have heard some horror stories over that.  personally i don't want any type of "pull payments"  
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:44:22
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:51:02
i'd think that you will have a bitcoin wallet,  just like you have usd, cad, eur etc.  and it will convert on the fly.
you would still have to wait the initial confirmations to fund your account
right now many peoples only option is to go to a gas station with cash in hand and buy prepaid card,  so around the same time.. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:45:47
in Canada the options all suck,  i am not well versed with the options other than USA or Canada but can assume that restrictions are similar in the western world
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:35:12
one of the most common ways of funding pokerstars today is walking to the gas station cash in hand and buying a prepaid visa with an enormous fee,  and even those are a crapshoot.. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:25:58
if it does infact become the longest chain again,  wouldn't the behavior of the default eth client be to follow it?? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:32:15
? please clarify.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:59:38
i am not an expert,  i am going by personal experience and what i know of online poker and bitcoin,  using both extensively for years.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:35:46
looks like i might be wrong..  but the guys saying 40k coins left i think are wrong too
now i am confused..
looking into it now as i thought they were all done after this..
rough math so far..
draper - 30k
BIT - 48k
draper - 2k
this new auction - 50k
= 130k
looks like most sources say it was 144k coins total seized
edit: ugh another 30k originally seized from SR, so yeah 40k left
