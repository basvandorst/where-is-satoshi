Saving this to see if anyone comes up with a reasonable answer; I'm also having a heckuva time getting Coinbase to let me verify any payment method. (Currently waiting on a reply from their CS, though it said it may take 72+ hours.) 
I may simply be too picky about what I want to do with Bitcoin. I'm based in the US. (Gemini, CEX, et cetera do not offer service to me, but made me create accounts before they'd tell me that.) I need it to make one ~$100 transaction, once every ~2 months; I have no interest in carrying a balance or installing/learning/safeguarding software, and I'm pretty pissed off at the idea of it taking 2-10 days (plus wire transfer fees and/or a 20%-400% markup if you want to do sketchy P2P "business" via the nightmare sites like localbitcoins, paxful, mycelium, et cetera) to process a single entirely-digital money transfer in/out of an entirely-digital Internet-native currency.
I think I was spoiled by Circle a couple of months ago, the first time I tried using Bitcoin to pay for this transaction; the whole thing was simple and straightforward, took a matter of minutes, and was done—like every other purchase I've made in my life with "fiat" currency. Logged into Circle yesterday to try to do the same thing again, only to find myself forced to step into the hellscape that is Bitcoin. I've spent a day and a half trying to figure anything useful out, and most of what I can find is condescending assholes linking to the same few sites that don't seem to offer reasonable solutions for simple money transfers—though I now have verified accounts with half a dozen exchanges who either don't offer service to me because of where I live or want to charge me 7.5%-33% service fees to wait a business week to be allowed to spend my money.
**Edit:** Still haven't heard back from Coinbase CS, but despite the thing saying it couldn't try it again for a week I managed to get it to re-try the verification process tonight &amp; it all went through this time. Uploading my ID to increase my limit enough to actually make my order took about a dozen tries, but once that was all complete the process went smoothly. Buying Bitcoin, sending Bitcoin, quick and easy and transparent. \*sigh* The signup process should *not* be this difficult.
