Even in the USA, people have no trouble at all with using the "milli-" prefix.
They routinely use "millimeters" when talking about cameras.
They have no difficulty understanding "milligrams" listed on packaged food.
They have no difficulty understanding "milliliters" listed on wine and soda bottles.
And though the "micro-" SI prefix is less common in lay usage, people do know that "micro" means something very tiny.
Those of you who think people are having difficulty understanding bitcoins due to decimal places or the use of milli- and micro- prefixes are I think mistaken. Here's a simple observation:
- People who understand bitcoins also understand millibitcoins and microbitcoins.
- People who don't understand bitcoins also don't understand millibitcoins and microbitcoins.
The lack of understanding has nothing to do with the prefixes. The prefixes are easy to understand.
It's the bitcoin concept itself that is hard to understand for many people.
Talking about "bits", which already have an existing well-defined meaning, is not going to make bitcoins any easier to understand. It will simply add to the confusion. Now the lay person, who has with some difficulty figured out the difference between 32 bits and 64 bits, will have to figure out how to apply that knowledge to a different meaning of "bits".
Bitcoins are not bits.
Calling them bits will make things more confusing, not less.
Just call them bitcoins, millibitcoins, and microbitcoins.
Or BTC, mBTC, µBTC.
Or XBT, mXBT, µXBT.
