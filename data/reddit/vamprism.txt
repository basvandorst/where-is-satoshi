Hopefully when your referring to hacks you don't mean on the bitcoin blockchain itself because AFAIK that currently seems to be impossible (7 years in, no hacks, and not because of lack of trying).
(We'll leave the quantum computing argument for another day because with quantum computing a lot more than just bitcoin becomes potentially vulnerable, and were a longs ways off from that either way) 
If you mean in regards to these 3rd parties that people are constantly giving their bitcoin to hold, yeah, they can be hacked, but that's no different from robbers walking into a shop (or a bank?) And sticking it up for its cash. 
In future the unprofessional and insecure exchanges (and other 3rd party actors) will be filtered out by better/more secure ones and most likely act in a similar manor to a bank, however, for those of us that personally secure our own bitcoin, on our own wallets, with our own private keys, security wise, were pretty much safe.

In 100 years, i believe A.Antonopoulos will be looked upon as a wise man of his (this) time in regards to bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.
I for sure took his advise, and i am fairly confident my bitcoin are not at risk.
i **Never** leave my bitcoin with **Any** 3rd party.

Answers (although some may have better answers for you)
A1. No, i personally would not advise keeping bitcoin on a normal USB, if you plan to hold more than 0.5bitcoin *(500,000bits)*, get yourself a [Hardware wallet]( i recommend either a Trezor, KeepKey or Ledger nano **S**. alternatively, there are some amazing mobile wallets also, generally for every day use, but there are guides on how to securely use mobile wallets such as breadwallet for long term storage here on reddit, i recommend Mycelium, Copay or Breadwallet *(Note, when downloading, make sure you are not downloading fake malicious versions of the wallets.)*
A2. You can buy bitcoin from services such as Coinbase.com and circle.com, alternatively, see if there are any local [bitcoin ATMs in your area]( you can purchase bitcoin in seconds from ATMs and have them sent near enough instantly to your wallet. *(note: never leave you bitcoins on any exchange or with any 3rd party such as the two mentioned above, as you purchase them, send the coins to a wallet you own/control, leave bitcoins with a 3rd party at your own risk.)*
A3. Is bitcoin a viable investment? [You tell me.](
As with any investment, never risk more than you can afford to loose, but i personally look at bitcoin as much more than an investment, at the same time, i truly believe it is digital gold.
A4. [This]( not sure if this video will help, but its very late, and i have to wake up at 5am, apologies for my laziness, maybe someone else can better answer Q4, in a nutshell though, Bitcoin empowers the user, its freedom, its open, its borderless, global, and free for anyone to use without asking for permission from anyone. Digital Gold, a secure storage of wealth *(as long as you own on your private keys)*, one of the real beauties of bitcoin is the fact that there can never be more than 21million bitcoin, that in it self is amazing, for various reasons.

Unless i misinterpreted your comment, are you saying what Kim is trying to do with Mega &amp; Bitcoin is unwelcome? 
I dont feel at all qualified to comment on what this will mean for the scaling issues, but personally, i welcome what he is trying to do with Bitcoin, like you said -


But from what i know, there are many other innovations being built upon Bitcoin besides it being just a peer-to-peer cash payment technology, although this may be its main use case, the likelihood is that bitcoin will be used for a whole host of things in the future isnt it?
i see this as just another branch in the ever growing tree of bitcoin.


He says it will work regardless of the current scaling issues, and sounds like he believes he's actually solved the scaling issues, whether or not this is true i dont know *(my gut tells me no)*, but lets wait and see what happens in January.
Again, i might have misinterpreted your comment though.

you mean to say "I had $10,000 stolen out of a ~~Paper~~ a unsecure PDF stored on my unsecure online computer"
I dont mean to sound patronising, but really man? A paper wallet means what it means, Paper wallet, like a physical paper wallet, what you had was not a paper wallet, it was a PDF.
Get yourself a Hardware wallet like a Trezor or a Keepkey, make sure your keep the recovery phrase safe (anywhere you deem safest if not a bank saftey deposit box) this way, even if the device you keep your bitcoins on is lost or stolen, still you and only you will have access to your Bitcoin.
Alternativly, download Breadwallet for IOS or Mycelium for android, (Or CoPay on either) all of the above are 100x safer methods than your PDF wallet.
Edit: Downloading a bitcoin wallet to a mobile device, you still need to keep your recovery phrase in a safe place so just like the hardware wallets, if the mobile device is compromised in anyways, you still have sole access to your bitcoin.

The way all these banker types are really trying to separate Bitcoin and Blockchain, he says the Fed wont want to work with bitcoin; because its something that was probably made in somebody's mothers basement but they will use Blockchain technologies...if im not mistaken, if Bitcoin was made in somebody's mothers basement then the Blockhain technologies they speak of were also made in somebody's mothers basement! 
When will they see that blockchain technologies  = The Bitcoin Blockchain. 
All this talk about this blockchain revolution by these banksters yet all fail to make mention of Satoshi, its like they try to paint a picture to the public that they invented the blockchain and Bitcoin was invented by jokers.

I said the same thing in not so many words. If he was in control of the pivate keys, neither of them would have to worry whether or not the money he deposited would be secured and insured like tradition investment sites.
(i agree) These bitcoin exchange's are not like the traditional investment sites, all the more reasons not to put so much trust in them.
I understand the reasoning for some people leaving bitcoin on them maybe fore day trading, but even then, like your comment suggests, these bitcoin exchanges sites are not like traditional investments site, day traders do this at their own risk.

Well if you assume bitcoin is here for the long term (100+ years), 18 months is actually a short period of time, furthermore, the 8 years Bitcoin has even been a thing is a very short period of time, dont get me wrong though i do see the cause for concern,but setting how long the blocksize debate has been going on aside, i *"Personally"* believe the post i linked too above is what as i consider as "Rushed".
Also two quick points to your comments;


The fact that it is 1-line of code, i dont think has anything to do with it, it could be 1-line or 100-lines.


Im sorry, im probably alone on this one, but imho, i could care less about whales, a bitcoiner is a bitcoiner whether you have 500k bits or 500 Bitcoin. I dont feel like the depth of someone's pocket should add extra weight to their vote on the matter, or any matter.
I also want to point out that i do want bigger blocks, i joined the bitcoin community after the Blocksize debate started, and i hate it that there is a split between the community, at the end of the day both sides *(conspiracy theories aside)* believe they are doing what is best for Bitcoin, everyone shares that common interest, a bitcoiner is a bitcoiner regardless of which side of the argument you are on &amp; regardless of how deep your pockets are, i personally believe we will get past this episode in the Bitcoin story, i see several scaling solutions being implemented and down the road i even see a 2mb (or more) hardfork, call me Mr. Naïve or Mr.Optimistic, either way i dont believe what is going on in the post i linked above is a good thing.

Get yourself a hardware walet if you plan on holding more than 1BTC (Trezor, KeepKey or Ledger Nano S) 
Get yourself a hot wallet for quick spending, such as Copay, Mycelium or Breadwallet (avaiibke on Android and IOS, but double and triple check you are downloading legitimate/official versions of the walets and not fake ones) 
Get great discounts on amazon using Purse.io 
Spendabit.co for ideas on where you can spend your bitcoin
Overstock.com buy everyday goods and electronics using bitcoin.

Took me a while to pull the trigger also, that's one of my regrets though, because the price was much much cheaper when i initially started looking into it, and had more than doubled by the time i actually decided to go for it.
I dont do any mining, its one of the first things i looked into as a newbie, but decided it was wiser to just buy Bitcoin rather than mine it as it seemed to me mining was*(is)* only worth while large scale. Instead of mining, buy whenever there's a price crash.

I would recommend using either Breadwallet, Copay or Mycelium (Android).
But be very weary about fake malicious apps on the app/play store.
I also recommend you never leave your bitcoin on an exchange. (buying from services such as Coinbase is fine, but try and learn about owning and controlling your own private keys before doing so)
If you plan on owning more than $500 worth, buy yourself a Hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano s, KeepKey)
spend maybe 5-10% of your bitcoin and save the rest, spending it (in my opinion) is good for bitcoin but also, actually putting your bitcoin to use is a practical way of learning, buying my first Pizza with bitcoin was fun lol.
if you can, and depending on how much you believe in it, aim for the 1/1,000,000th club, only 1 million people can own 21 Bitcoins, i feel as this is a good target to head for, im no where near myself, but its definitely something on my radar. And future you will thank you at 5k per coin.
Advice: Dont look at bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme, the price is going to rise...then fall, then rise again, then rise some more, then fall, then rise, then fall some more and maybe some more after that, but then rise again *(loosely paraphrased from Andreas)* Point is, bitcoin is for the long play, 7 years ago it was worth nothing, today its $600, 7 years is nothing, its a relatively short period of time, think 20 years.
Focus more on the benefits bitcoin actually give to the world, focus on the fact that you can make payments without any middle men charging huge fees, focus on the fact that in the event of another recession, your bitcoin would be safe, the fact that your wallet cannot be frozen, the fact that no one can take your funds from you (once the correct precautions have been taken, e.g dont leave funds on an exchange), heck if you wanted you could send me $10k right now if you wanted and no one could do anything to stop you *(hint hint lol)*
You get my point though, welcome to bitcoin land, happy bitcoining fellow bitcoiner.

A Ponzi scheme requires an initial founder who persuades investors that they’ll make some sort of profit. There is no central point of power in Bitcoin, as it’s a decentralized system, so no promises of profits are made by the network.
A Ponzi scheme always requires new investors to pay off earlier investors. This is not the case with Bitcoin, as the system can work with practically any number of users. However, the network is stronger and more resilient when used by more people.
If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then all other forms of money were also initially developed as Ponzi schemes.


It is a currency not a stock.
The first people to use Bitcoin have profited because of the low value bitcoins had at the beginning. There were no lies or promises concerning it's value.
Bitcoin is a transparent trading system and profit of it's early investors is not of the selling of something that was promised to rise in value.

When i first got into Bitcoin, my first wallet was blockchain.info, forgot about it (empty wallet) for a while, decided to get back into bitcoin, my 2nd wallet was a blockchain.info wallet, (couple $s, if that, in there).
Heard from a few different sources Web wallets are not the most reliable wallets (they're not).
Got myself a real wallet.
Not enough bitcoin yet to justify a Trezor but i will be either buying a trezor or keepkey soon enough though.
Im sure there are others that were/are in a similar position creating their first wallet with Blockchain.info, more than half of those are probably test/ghost wallets.
Just cause trezor chrome app only has 8000 downloads doesnt mean much, there are other hardware wallets out there, many people use paper wallets, many people use mobile wallets.
**Not everyone has enough bitcoin to justify buying a hardware wallet, what may not be a significant amount of Bitcoin to you, may be a whole lot of bitcoin to someone else.**

Don't leave your coins on an exchange or on any web wallet or with any 3rd part, if they (the 3rd party) are hacked or if anything happens to them, you may loose your bitcoin, or they can decide for whatever reason not to release your bitcoin to you.
Get a Trezor or Ledger nano S, much safer.
Heck I even think some mobile wallets are safer than web wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:44:01
Download Breadwallet on IOS, or Mycelium on Android (Or Copay on either), or buy a hardware wallet (a Trezor or Keepkey).
Best time to buy is now, as a Bitcoin Exchange, (not bitcoin itself) was hacked today, so this is good for you for two reasons.
1. The price has dropped, now is your chance to buy the dip and get some cheap bitcoin before the price recovers, and it *will* recover.
2. Let today serve as a personal reminder to yourself, a smart man learns from his mistakes, a wise man learns from others mistakes. **Never leave your bitcoin with an exchange, or any other 3rd party** you must own your bitcoin, and you own your bitcoin by owning and controlling the private keys.
Any of the wallets i mentioned above are perfect for this, or you could go 1 step further and create a paper wallet, the simple method is one of those i mentioned though.
And keep your recovery phrase safe, this way even if you loose the device storing your bitcoin, or if its stolen, you **still** own and control your bitcoin.
**Edit:** If you want to test the waters, [find a Bitcoin ATM in your area]( and buy a couple dollars worth first, im sure you can even buy $1 worth in some places if you really wanted, check if there are any [local shops in your area that accept bitcoin]( where you can spend them, if not there are a wide range of places that [accept them as a payment method online]( much much better than paypal imo.
My personal advise is to ~~Hold~~  **Hodl** 90% of your bitcoin though, i believe in spending, but i also believe you will be able to get alot more for your bitcoin 5-10 years from now.

its the kids being born now that will make real use of bitcoin when they're older having being born into it, 7 years is nothing, reflect back on this post in 20 years.


Remember, Bitfinex got hacked, not Bitcoin. Exchanges can and will be hacked from time to time, thats why its so important not to leave bitcoin on exchanges, not while bitcoin is still in its infancy anyways, which brings me onto my next point.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, we consider those who bought bitcoin prior to the ATH early adopters, but in reality, in 15-20 years, everyone who owns even a little bitcoin today (2016) will also be considered early adopters.
I personally believe bitcoin is on the brink, others have probably thought the same in recent years, but look at what the price of bitcoin is right now, even with the bitfinex hack it dwarfs the price of what it was at he end of 2015, heck its more than doubled and is rocking steady, ignoring the ATH of 2013, bitcoins been on a uphill ride the whole 7 years, taking into consideration the ATH of 2013, a steady $1000 per coin is not at all unrealistic.

Im sure you can understand why its so hard for me and probably others to imagine banks embracing bitcoin, i can understand why they would do so, i believe it would be a competitivly smart move, but i just dont see it, *but*, in saying that, like you said - 


And everyone thought that sounded crazy not too many years ago and look at where we are today, i guess it would only take one local bank to make the first move for others to follow in the same footsteps.
(i personally would probably never keep my bitcoin in a bank, as with many other most likley but i think such a thing may be necessary for the masses, bitcoin at the moment is just too complicated for Joe Public.)

If you have an emotional reaction 
To everything that is said to you
True power is sitting back
And observing everything 
With logic; true power is
If words control you that
Means everyone else can 
control you; breathe and 
Allow things to pass.

I understand the dilemma, I had a similar incident with refund ordering pizza online, but with me the store couldn't send my food, the customer service gal that called didn't know what bitcoin was, then she passed me onto another lady who did know, but she said she could only issue the refund to a card, not back in bitcoin.

I always wonder why newcomers always try to look into mining first, its funny, I did the same thing.
Forget about mining, for now at least anyway. 
If you want Bitcoin, buy it from an exchange or from a Bitcoin ATM (see: coinatmradar.com).
And only store your bitcoin in wallets you own the private keys too.

I didn't use it at that particular time no, I will do in future however. 
I've used several bitcoin ATMs in the past, the last time being about a week ago now, but I've never used a "sell" ATM, I have wanted too, but there wasn't one close to me, this one is still a short drive away but I commute in the area for work sometimes so its convenient enough. 
The guys in my usual ATM spot I have asked them how often its used he said enough for him to want to keep it.
When I next go to this new spot I stumbled upon, I'll ask them how often its been used in the time he's had it.

I truly hope I am wrong and wish someone could come up with a good counter-argument.**
*Let me help you with that*
"In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they’ll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy."
[Bitcoin Myths: It's a giant ponzi scheme](


It is also important to note that Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin, has never spent a bitcoin (other than giving them away when they were worthless) which we can verify by checking the blockchain.
[NASDAQ Top 10 Myths about Bitcoin: 7. Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme](


A Ponzi scheme requires an initial founder who persuades investors that they’ll make some sort of profit. There is no central point of power in Bitcoin, as it’s a decentralized system, so no promises of profits are made by the network.
A Ponzi scheme always requires new investors to pay off earlier investors. This is not the case with Bitcoin, as the system can work with practically any number of users. However, the network is stronger and more resilient when used by more people.
If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then all other forms of money were also initially developed as Ponzi schemes.

Buy, &amp; ~~Hold~~ Hodl.
In 10 years time, if Bitcoin lives up to its potential, you wont even need to sell your coins in exchange for dollars or pounds or euros or whatever your native fiat currency is, you will be able to spend you bitcoins no differently than how you spend you money now (*Especially online*)
Although i do advise you hold your coins, as I'm sure you know there are a few places where you can currently spend your bitcoins, and save a lot of money by doing so.
Also, i wouldn't advise leaving your coins in Coinbase or with any exchange for that matter.
Keep them safe.

well, back in 2011, i was &gt;this&lt; close to buying some bitcoins, and decided not too, i probably only would have bought about 50$ worth as i was a student at the time too, but still you can imagine my regret lol.
I don't earn much so i havent quite made 1BTC yet, but when i can, i buy a little every now and then, regardless of price.
(side note, another regret, when bitcoin was $250-$300 a few months ago, i had some savings and my car, i was going to sell the car, and use that money &amp; my savings to buy what would have been 25Btc, this was maybe around 8 months ago now, today, 25bitcoins = $18k more than double)

Plus a few other factors, but the dip is unimportant, even if the price was to crash to 500, its still more than it was 2 months ago.

Kteara, this is what you have to be mindful of, my recommendation from experience is convert your £ to BTC (whatever amount you can afford) as and when you can, because you may regret it later, i read above your from the UK, me too, and want to know where im coming from just now?  A bitcoin ATM machine, i was on my way home, knew i would be driving past one, had the spare cash on me, so i bought some bitcoin :) 
it is all down to preference though, some receive all their money in bitcoin converted automatically, some buy monthly, some buy As&amp;When, no way is the right way, me personally (for now anyway) when i get paid from work, i spend some on bitcoin, if i have a spare £20 and im near an ATM, i get some bitcoin.

This is another neat way to spend your bitcoin almost **anywhere**  its a bitcoin debit card. (and im pretty sure your employer can pay you directly onto the card if that's what you wanted)

I don't have a Bitcoin debit card myself yet, but I do plan on getting one, so far I'm leaning towards getting a Wirex card (previously e-coin) 
Only heard good things so far, at first I was considering xapo but I have seen too many people talking about the card being declined during use. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:08:20
that's actually sad to hear, not even funny actually, there's a good chance if you try to inform them, you will fall on deaf ears, because together they have put in 30grand, they will likely be in denial about the whole thing, crypto currencies should not be looked at or used as a get rich quick scheme, (which is how onecoin is sold, this should have been the first red flag)
 
Blockchain is the revolutionary technology, and *THE* blockchain is **The Bitcoin Blockchain**, aimed at helping people and changing the world.
There will be other altcoins, but people MUST be wary and do extensive research, **especially if its a centralized altcoin.**

Cause it will probably bubble after that,  and you don't want to be buying any at the peak of a bubble unless your on a buy schedule (e.g unless you buy x amount of bitcoin per week anyways,  if this is the case the price doesn't really matter.)

You don't need the permissions of ISPs to transact in Bitcoin, cant block bitcoin without blocking the entire internet, they try to block torrents but look how far that's got them (and even so, torrents may not be the best example, because you can still do offline transaction with bitcoin if necessary.)

Still up +130% for the month, +510% for the last year and +607% for the last 2 years (at current dipped price) 
Ignore the short term drops and gains in price, Bitcoin is a long term game unless your a day trader. 
This time Next year all those %s I mentioned above will rise, and and this current dip will be dwarfed on the charts, just as the others dips before it have been dwarfed. 
I wasn't here in the early days but I laugh when I look at the drop from $30 to $2 lol that must have been insane back then,  but look nowadays that crash looks like pretty much a straight line on the historic price graph.

I thought what the miner said about countries having their own digital currencies (digital dollar) and having to use bitcoin as international transfers was interesting, reminds me of an archived post i read about banks having to use bitcoin.


Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:21:09
21 Million bitcoins only. *(That's less than half of the people in the UK alone, let alone the world)*
7 Billion people on earth *(nearly 8 if it isn't already)*
I have never been good at maths but I'm sure that's only enough for *0.002 bitcoin per person*, 
now in saying that, i know even in the perfect of situations the likelihood is not every single person on earth will own some bitcoin, but considering there are billions of people unbanked worldwide, and bitcoin gives those that are unwillingly unbanked the ability to be their own bank in a sense, i would say we are definitely still in the very very early stages, we have seen nothing yet compared to what's yet to come for bitcoin.
So remember people, **hodl**, ride the volatility wave, when you converted your fiat into bitcoin, you bought yourself front row seats on earths biggest rollercoaster, so **hodl** on tight, and enjoy the ride.
Bitcoins future in incredibly bright.

I also prefer to use "bits", it was after using the Breadwallet i became accustom to using bits, its also how i explain the use of bitcoins to anyone for the first time.
* Do you think that full bitcoins will be a usable denomination in the future when bitcoin becomes a major global currency? Obviously we feel that it will not be, so given that, is it better for everyone to switch to a more usable denomination today, or wait for the number of bitcoin users to grow first and then switch? Do you think today that dealing with an mount like .03465 is easier or 34,650? If the latter, wouldn't it make more sense to encourage the person making a request denominated in bitcoins to switch to more user friendly bits?
* They are equivalent to micro-bitcoins
* They also have exactly two decimal places themselves, which matches nearly every other currency in use across the planet, perfect for bringing bitcoin to every person who uses money (many people who use money do not and will never understand arbitrary precision decimals).

If you have an iPhone,  use Copay or Breadwallet app if your on Android,  I would suggest Copay (although I prefer Mycelium on Android,  I think Copay is a lot better for new users,  and just as secure) 
Don't forget to write down your recovery seed,  very important and keep it safe.
Overall if you plan on getting any more than $150 worth I would buy a Hardware Wallet,  and I suggest buying either the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor,  both very good and a lot better than keeping your bitcoin on your phone or any pc.

Using bits make so much sense to me, Any time I'm explaining bitcoin to someone,  especially someone that believes its to late to get involved in bitcoin because of the price of 1BTC,  I say okay watch me send you 1000bits. 
Edit: I would also like to say I can really imagine the term 'Satoshi' being shortened to a 'Sat'. 
When talking about bitcoin to people that are generally unfamiliar with it,  i have heard on more than one occasion people describe the Satoshi as. sounding silly (I personally have no issue with it),  like the moment it gets to explaining the Satoshi they look at me like I'm talking about monopoly money. 
I don't think the Satoshi is going away,  but I recon we will be dealing with Bits and Sats in the future,  not Bitcoins and Satoshi's, 1 whole Bitcoin will seem like a ludicrous amount soon, I personally think anything less than $10k/1Bitcoin should be considered cheap coins (not that I can afford bitcoin at its current price lol but soon enough 1 bitcoin will cost tens of thousands of dollars Imo.)

I bought bitcoin from an Atm a few hours ago,  it's still unconfirmed,  Im usually not worried about unconfirmed transactions,  but my worry is that it will stay unconfirmed and eventually roll back to the Atm in which case the Atm will have both my Fiat and bitcoin :/ ??

Never leave bitcoin on an exchange or with any 3rd party longer than you have too, immediately transfer your bitcoin to a wallet you own.
Trevor, Nano S &amp; keepkey I believe are the best hardware wallets on the market, and I certainly recommend a hardware wallet for the amount you plan to buy.

1.Buy from Circle, Coinbase or a Local bitcoin Atm. 
2a. Send the bitcoin immediately to a wallet you own the keys too. 
2b. If buying more than 0.5bitcoin,  purchase a hardware wallet (Trezor or a Ledger Nano S) Imo this is the best way to secure bitcoin from theft and accidental loss. 
3. Create an account with an exchange,  send bitcoin to it whenever your decide to sell,if your day trading it's not advisable to leave any more bitcoin with an exchange (or any 3rd party)  than your willing to loose.  
My 2cents: Never sell,  only hold. 
Spend your bitcoin when the price rises rather than sell.

Gotta love bullish bitcoin posts,  help me sleep better at night, I think 20k in 2020 is a little out there but I love it either way. 
My personal opinion,  I dont think 5k is outrageous for 2020,  of course it's impossible for anyone to know but I have my fingers crossed for an ETF approval and a slow steady climb to the 5k mark over the next 4 years. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 04:19:41
Do you mean compared to localBitcoins sites prices?  Yes LocalBitcoins sellers usually charge a premium to my understanding, to get a better price than localbitcoins buy from an exchange,  or even try Coinbase or Circle.com but please completely educate yourself on wallets and private keys before you do,  as it's never wise to leave your bitcoin on an exchange ones bought.

Buy &amp; hold the majority,  occasionally spend a small %. 
(if you have a to buy something and the option to use bitcoin is there,  if your were going to spend the Fiat anyways why not use the bitcoin [potentially paying less] and replace the bitcoin with the Fiat you were going to spend anyways) 
I believe spending a little helps to encourage merchant adoption,  but I also believe its wise to hodl.

Isn't there a patent that PayPal has filed involving bitcoin? (Or at the very least crypto currencies iin general), something to do with a wallet I think but don't quote me.
My guess is Paypal are watching the space closely, bitcoin as a payment system IMO is a much better option than PayPal, PayPal are Likley summing up the potential Bitcoin has for mass adoption and don't want to get left out, I expect if Bitcoin is what its supposed to be in the next 10-25 years, PayPal will have its own Bitcoin Wallet.

Also,  again, it's very possible Satoshi is dead.

@_date: 2016-09-17 23:54:11
The creator (Satoshi) currently has 0 control over the open source bitcoin protocol, him not revealing his identity and taking a step back further solidifies this, furthermore all of Satoshi bitcoins are viewable on the blockchain he hasn't touched them. 
Truth be told, it's very likely that Satoshi is dead.

I don't think any major government will 100% "go against bitcoin", Well at least I think it's not likely.  
Imagine if the US went on an all out ban of bitcoin and made transacting in bitcoin illegal, but then the following day China adopts bitcoin as it's main currency (not saying that any of this would happen but just of examples sake)  and because China has now gone full steam ahead on bitcoin a few other smaller countries decide to adopt it too, the US can't sit back while the rest of the world moves on to ~~Blockchain~~ Bitcoin Technology. 
I believe this goes for all major governments,  none will completely try to burn bitcoin in fears of their neighbors welcoming it.  
This probably could have been explained better but it's quite late and I think I'll head to bed instead of proof reading it for errors lol.

Very scary thought indeed,  I always think to myself,  Bitcoin has maybe 3-4 million users, which is a decent number for its age imo, however,  If a couple major banks decided to launch they're own crypto currency with all the PR and marketing with it,  they could surpass 3million in no time couldn't ťhey? 
This along with. The media spouting the usual "the dangers of bitcoin"  type doom &amp;  gloom headlines,  Bitcoin could have an uphill fight on its hands. 
Of course Bitcoin will still have many many advantages over this BankCoin such as the 21m cap and the whole decentralisation thing but I think there are more people that don't understand the benefits of such features than those that do. 
All this being said,  I'm about 80% sure Bitcoin will have an important (&amp;global) role to play in the future of finance and Blockchain endeavours in other industries.

Unless you plan on mining on a very large scale it would be much,  much cheaper for you to just purchase your bitcoin directly, and of course keep them in a wallet you own,  and when I say own I mean your private keys make sure you own the private keys to your wallet (don't leave bitcoin with any 3rd party such as an exchange basically,  I would recommend getting a Trezor or Ledger nano S hardware wallet if you plan on getting more than 0.5btc anything less just download a mobile wallet to your phone such as breadwallet for IOS or Mycelium for Android) 
Mining hasnt been profitable for individuals for some time now as far as I'm aware,  only bitcoin hobbyists mine as individuals, "for fun"  I guess. (not to knock it or anything,  I mean I want to mine just for the sake of it too one day to be honest lol as I missed out too during the early days) 
Maybe mining for individuals will be a thing again in
 a couple years as I believe there are companies in the space working towards making that a reality again as we speak.  
Welcome to bitcoin. 
EDIT: Don't forget you can spend your bitcoin but it's advisable to hodl a decent % of it as an investment,  but yes you can spend bitcoin at places such as Overstock.com for example.

Yeah I completely understand this, but Bitcoin wouldn't just benefit non-government people it benefits all people, including government, it strips away certain powers from them such as pumping money out of thin air, but at the same time the Bitcoin Blockchain would potentially save governments $billions a year.
I wish I could find the report the bank of Canada did, and I'm a little lazy to search for it now (just woke up, sorry lol) but in it, they clearly show a positive interest towards Bitcoin.
I suspect that secretly there are probably a minority of  Bankers &amp; people in government that would more than happy to see Bitcoin take over. 
Even take a look at the talk Andreas did with the Canadian government (Im pretty sure it was anyway, was quite a while back now, I forget) by the end of the talk you could see that the vast majority of them went away with a positive view on Bitcoin.

If I had an unexpected sudden income of 17k I'd be very tempted to do the same thing to be honest, deep down I know it would be a bad idea, but the little voice in the back of my head would be telling me "fuck it, go all out and Hodl!" then again, so would the voices in my shoulders, neck, back, pancreas, kidneys, toes, heck I'd be going full Tyler Durden with a sudden 17k and bitcoin on the mind as I'm sure would many others. 
What I do know though, considering it was unexpected, if it were me for sure @ least 5k of that would be designated to some bitcoin, still gives you 12k to allocate elsewhere. (Be sure that Tyler doesn't find it though) 
The bitcoiner in me also wants you to know, I'm pretty sure you could join the 1/1000000th club with that 17k and get yourself 21bitcoin :) and then some.

IMO, from a *customers* prospective this sounds very much like a MLM scheme, some may mistake bitcoin to be a Onecoin style scam, especially any misinformed that *know* that Onecoin is a ponzi but don't know much about (real) crypto-currencies in general, I imagine these people would instantly put Bitcoin into the OneCoin bracket.
Not so much the introduction to bitcoin, and explaining to them how to buy bitcoin, this is always good, but should be free, I don't think anyone should have to pay about learning bitcoin, not just yet at least, maybe once bitcoin becomes a house hold name there will be places to teach people about bitcoin, but right now, all this should be done for free.

Just to play devils advocate, I can remember before the ETC split, the guys in favour of the original chain saying the same thing (the bailout chain being an altcoin) but unfortunately the mainstream don't see it this way, ETH is still ETH to them even though it's the forked chain and ETC is the altcoin. 
I hate being susceptible to FUD, as I do believe the bitcoin as we know it today will be the same bitcoin 2 months from now and the same bitcoin 2 years from now, but seeing what happened with ETH/ETC worries me, in the event of a fork I am in favour of getting rid of any BTC on a chain that has anything that resembles a centralised coin but id love to be put at ease on this topic. 
I actually feel to just turn away from looking into bitcoin and its price for a while, set up a recurring buy and check back in on the community and price at the end of the year and see what the playing field looks like. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:15:31

We sold Game keys, and I'm not disputing porn sites may be more at risk, are those porn sites you mention using PayPal by any chance? Because I was specific in saying Chargeback attacks Via PayPal. 
And I will say again, feel free to google it if you want too, I can assure you I am **NOT** the only person to suffer such an attack, I would also like to say in no way did **I** fuck up, the fuck up is on Paypal for allowing it, they have no protection for digital goods, again I spoke to many many others who have said they suffer such attacks all the time and it costs them thousands a month, just cause you don't hear businesses crying about it doesn't mean it's not happening, look at all the companies that are stockpiling Bitcoin to pay off hackers that install ransom ware, they just put up with it, and include it in the cost of running business, same goes for the other digital goods site owners I spoke with they just include the chargebacks in the costs and don't fight it (more so because PayPal are terrible when it comes to chargebacks) 
With Bitcoin, all those people would no longer have to just put up with it. 
Try selling a digital product online, and if a customer issues a chargeback through PayPal, just wait see who's favour PayPal will be in, and once the criminal has PayPal in his/her corner you can almost guarantee they are going to be back with a new IP and new Email address.

[Bitcoin Debit Card]( only for emergencies in cases where you absolutly need to spend fiat, they come in handy, but going all in into bitcoin means spending bitcoin directly from your hotwallet rather than a debit card.
 - Find more than 2.5-million things you can buy with Bitcoin.
overstock.com - cant go wrong with overstock.
Purse.io - save money by spending bitcoin on amazon.
Edit: oh and, never keep your bitcoin stored on any exchange, none at all. Make sure you are in control over your private keys, maybe invest in a hardware wallet like a KeepKey or a Trezor, try not to keep the bulk of your coins in one place if you can, if you go for a hardware wallet (or even a mobile wallet) write down the passphrases and keep them in the safest place imaginable, such as a safe, or safety deposit box in a bank.
Edit 2: Mobile wallet recommendation - Breadwallet (IOS), Copay, Mycelium. i would trust all 3 with decent amount of my coins, especially Breadwallet for me.

Use  to see if there are any Bitcoin ATMs in your area. You can buy bitcoin from any bitcoin ATM and there are quite a few that allow you to change bitcoin into you local currency and make fiat withdraws also.
Download a Bitcoin wallet, I recommend if you are on IOS using either Breadwallet or Copay and if you are on Android Copay or Mycelium
 (**Never** leave large amounts of bitcoin on any exchange or with any company like coinbase, do so at your own risk)
Depending on how much Bitcoin you plan on getting it might also be worth having a look at either [Trezor]( or [KeepKey]( Hardware wallets for offline storage.
You can find places online to spend your bitcoin [Here]( there are many online stores that accept bitcoin such as overstock.co and Expedia you can also save money buying items on amazon using bitcoin via Purse.io
Might also be worth checking out  for shops that may accept bitcoin in your area.

So we focus on making wallets even more user friendly, Bitcoin isn't at all that complicated, I'm no tech wiz, the way I see it, it's no different from when we were not familiar with using the internet back in the day, nowadays using the Internet is a lot more user friendly to the point where my 4 year old nephew knows what he's doing. 
I'm sorry I see your point don't get me wrong but leaving your Bitcoin in someone else's possession is just not advisable, like the other guy said, what happens when you decide to make a withdrawal of your funds and Coinbase decides otherwise? 
What if X amount of people decide to make a withdrawal from Coinbase in the same period of time? Does everyone get their funds? 
Suddenly your bitcoins can also be frozen. (And there are countless posts about innocent people's funds being held by companies just like Coinbase without warning and without any initial explanation) 
And further more, no one at all needs to know the amount of Bitcoin you have, no one needs to know you have cold storage, people storing their own private keys shouldn't increase home invasions in my opinion, you have a hot wallet and a cold wallet the cold wallet never need see the light of day, it doesn't even need to be kept in the house, and if it is, it doesn't need to be obvious to anyone that it is what it is, I know some people that use Breadwallet as means of cold storage, on the outside its just a phone, no one need know it holds bitcoins and even if it's stolen, you have the recovery methods of which are definitely not stored locally in your home.

Definitely cheaper when it comes to international transfers services such as Western Union, i would also say a lot cheaper than Paypal, lets also take into consideration that micro transactions as far as i know are not possible with these services. I also want to point out that i too, don't have accurate data on the past, present, future predictions of fees lol. 
I don't think bitcoin in its current state is best suited for cups of coffee (however i don't discourage this) i see Bitcoin at the moment as the perfect digital gold, but i do see bitcoin being used commonly for such things in the distant future, bitcoin will first thrive as digital gold, then on the internet with larger merchants then in your coffee shops.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:25:17
I personally wouldnt advise putting online how much bitcoin you have but since you have:
Why stop at 3? if you get to 21 Bitcoin you will be 1 of only 1million that can ever possibly own 21 bitcoin, i know 21 is a lot but my point is its a good goal to aim for even if you don't reach it (due to price going up) you should buy a little more whenever you can.
and on top of that, there's nothing wrong with having a hot wallet to spend from, e.g you plan to buy something on amazon? add some bitcoin to your a hotwallet and buy using purse.io that way you receive a decent discount on your purchase, or better yet, check if the item you want is on overstock.co that way your buying direct, and it helps Bitcoin by letting merchants realise there are people out there that want alternative ways to spend money, this may encourage others to then being accepting bitcoin and you save money by paying in bitcoin, the more people using it the more the value will be which is an incentive to you as it increases the value of your cold storage savings :) if even 2% of the world were to begin using bitcoin the value per bitcoin would have to be $400k each,

I personally think it depends, you are right though, but at the same time, there are still apps better suited for merchants that turn your device into a POS device, im sure Bitpay has such an app.
More cost affective than having to buy a dedicated bitcoin POS device.
Are there any cash registers that have bitcoin POS built in?

[Wirex Bitcoin Debit Card](
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:01:13
I'm sorry but your incorrect, I did in fact run a digital downloads site, and due to a large series of chargeback attacks via PayPal, I could not afford to keep going. First month was a total of £500 from numerous purchases being charged back, this was a struggle in it self, and PayPal was not in our corner, the following month was, let's just say it was a lot worse and had to shut down, and to this day I am still in Dispute with PayPal over it. 
Charge backs may be rare for physical products but I can tell you they are definitely not rare for digital products, and you can ask all the other business owners that put up with chargeback attacks that cost them thousands a month because when seeking advice I spoke to many who was in the same boat I was, and more than a few of them basically just put up with it. 
This would not have happened with Bitcoin. 
Additionally, my bank card has been cloned twice in the past, and once money has been taken (stolen) from my account without authorisation.
I'm pretty confident that No one, and I mean no one apart from me has access to my Bitcoins. 
I also know better than to keep my Bitcoins on an exchange or to trust any 3rd parties with my private keys so as far as I'm concerned, My Bitcoins are more secure than the money in my bank account. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:59:33
To be honest im a Bitcoiner to my core (npi), but i don't believe its impossible for more than one crypto-currecy to exist long term *(i do however have a firm belief bitcoin will most likely always be number 1, as the Bitcoin Blockchain is THE Blockchain).*
The way i view bitcoin is as digital gold, and i view ether is as digital oil, i don't see either as competing currencies, but rather two separate blockchains in they're own respective lanes, that being said, i cant say that im impressed with the route Ethereum has gone down the last few weeks, as i no longer consider it an *immutable* ledger. 
If you had asked me pre-DAO fiasco what i thought about the future of Ethereum, i would have probably said the likelihood is Ether is here to stay as it has ~~had?~~ a lot of potential, now? im not as sure, its anybodies guess, we will just have to see how the rest of this year pans out.

There's risk in anything, for me, bitcoin can only go 1 of 2 ways, Extremely north, or extremely south, and i believe the last 8 years shows its a lot more likely to go North.
Don't invest more than you can afford, but it would be unwise not to have at least some btc.
Bitcoin has had its ups and down, but its still standing strong. Trust in the technology, and hodl.
@_date: 2016-07-23 10:51:29
Step 1. Download Breadwallet, Copay or Mycelium.
Step 2. Don't keep bulk of funds on Coinbase or try to use Coinbase as a hot wallet.
Step 3. Use one of the wallets from step 1 and never have to deal with this situation again. 
Sorry to hear what happened man. 
Edit: if your up for it and plan on going back to the same place any time soon, you should try pay in Bitcoin again using a proper wallet and review your experience.

Yeah the fact that Bitcoin is divisible needs to be apparent, when showing people Bitcoin I usually show them a hotwallet with just a few $ worth of Bitcoin on it, to better explain that you don't need to buy 1 whole Bitcoin, and if they are willing to open a wallet I'll send them a small amount and let them know a few of the places it can be spent. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:20:20
Everyone is Hodling, correct, but some *are* spending, if I need buy something from somewhere and I know I can buy with Bitcoin, I will take the fiat money and buy Bitcoin first, then buy whatever item it is I wanted using Bitcoin, because quite often there will be discounts for using Bitcoin which is an incentive for me, additionally I usually end up with more Bitcoin than I had before, after spending. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:48:25
Businesses dealing in digital goods benefit not only from cheaper fees but also reduced risk of chargeback attacks to next to zero, potentially saving said business a lot more than they save on cheaper fees alone.

Bitcoin always crashes, but it always crashes to a new high from what i can see, for example, the price is like $650 at the moment, lets assume it goes to $1500 over the next few days, the media will be all over it, majority of coverage will be positive and build up more hype around it, with some help from the hype bubble the price will eventually crash, lets assume its crashed to $800-900, the the media will being to create the "i told you so" headlines" and talk about unsafe bitcoin is, and how volatile it is, ignoring the fact that we were previously on $650 and are now up $200 on $900.
By the way, some advice, don't leave you bitcoin on any exchange, dont leave you bitcoin on coinbase, own your private keys.
try a mobile wallet out, i recommend: Breadwallet (iOS), Mycelium (Android), or Copay Bitcoin wallets.

Nothing wrong with wishful thinking i think, as long is it doesn't doesn't lead to delusions that the wishful thoughts are fact.

The next halving will take place in roughly 4 years, the next halving will be the big one imo, by that time, buying 1 whole btc is going to be limited to most peoples dreams as the reward per 10min block drops to 6.25bitcoin.
E: i believe *now (the next few years)* is pretty much most peoples best/last chance to grab 1 bitcoin, considering only 21 million people can own 1bitcoin, 21 bitcoin is even better as a goal, only 1 million people can own 21 bitcoin.

I was going to make similar comment but said it all but better, Bitcoin is about the long play, buying at regular intervals is probably your best bet, bitcoin has been on a (albeit very volatile) uphill run the last 8 years, i can only imagine 15 years from now.
Satoshi himself said 


Were just under half way into his prediction and bitcoin [has died over 100 times]( since 2009 and is still going strong. 
If bitcoin continues to grow (and my personal guess is it will), the price in 15 years should dwarf a $2000 price point.

Open up a bitcoin wallet by downloading "Breadwallet, Mycelium, Copay or Airbitz" or buy yourself a Bitcoin Hardware wallet like a Trezor or a KeepKey.

I saw it as a problem at first, heck it still might be, but at the end of the day, those with money will be able to buy more first &amp; there isn't really a work around for this apart from bitcoins divisibility.
One thing i notice is quite common with people is they'll say things like "i want to buy bitcoin, but its too expensive" which is annoying cause even if bitcoin was $1,000,000 anyone regardless of how deep or shallow your pockets are can still buy bitcoin, i believe  this illusion of not being able to buy bitcoin cause of its price could get worse once more whales move in and the price and scarcity increases, this is why we need healthy merchant adoption and to explain bitcoin in terms of a transfer of wealth (digital *spendable* gold) rather than something you can buy and get rich quick from, everyone new to bitcoin, wants a *Bit-Coin* when the fact is we should be, and inevitably will be dealing in *bits* in the future.

No, 21 bitcoin today *(or whatever amount)* is 21 bitcoin, 21 bitcoin next week, next month, next year(s) is still 21 bitcoin.
So going by your example:
If you bought $500 worth of bitcoin today which = about 0.75 bitcoin *(at current exchange rate )* but if the market crashed tomorrow to $250, you would still own the same 0.75 bitcoin you purchased the previous day, it would just be worth $250 now instead of $500, so would be the same if the market mooned tomorrow and the price rose, that same $500 is now $10,000, you would still own your 0.75 bitcoin but it would now be worth $10,000 instead of $500.
Hope this helped.

When you say 


I'm going to assume you must mean for extremely large amounts of Bitcoin, because I can tell you every time I have bought it has never taken more than a couple hours, if even that. Further more you can buy up to £500 ($600) worth, literally instantly from Bitcoin ATM machines. 
I've used Coinbase only once, and it was only out of curiosity, using Coinbase (or any exchange) as a wallet is probably one of the worst things you can do. (Absolutly Nothing wrong with buying Bitcoin from Coinbase btw, &amp; it's nothing personal to them as a company, but leaving Bitcoin on an exchange is like playing with fire imo) 
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:32:32
Yeah, considering the transactions didn't show as unconfirmed I would have assume it's an issue on Coinbase's part, (to be honest the merchant also should really be using a better POS suited for Bitcoin)

Its not the same thing though, you can buy 500,000 bits which is half of 1 bitcoin, and it will grow in value and you can spend it just as you would if you had 1 whole bitcoin, **You cant "drive" half a car, but you can certainly "spend" or "Hold" half a bitcoin.**
even if 1 bitcoin became 1 million, every divisible piece of 1 bitcoin would still have use and value. 
In the future the idea of owning 1 whole bitcoin will be Ludacris $700 for 1 is nothing! lol remember back when bitcoin reached 80-100$ per coin? back then everyone thought $100 dollars was insane, until an extra 0 was added and we saw $1000 per coin, if you think $700 is a lot, wait until halving 2020, you will be wishing you bought that *"part"* of a bitcoin.
Bitcoin is very much still in its infancy, in the future the only people transacting in whole bitcoins will be people/companies doing large transfers of value, everyone else will be dealing in bits *(or whatever the common term for individual units of bitcoin will be)*

Then begins the all out war on Bitcoin by the governments, suddenly laws &amp;amp;  regulations around Bitcoin tighten, Bitcoins use in black markets begin to be over-exaggerated way beyond its current levels of exaggeration, the majority won't care about the benefits of Bitcoin they will eat up what they are told, not realising that the centralised generic Gov'coin will be no different than fiat and solve no problems besides length of time it takes to make transfers.  
I'll still be Hodling. 
Edit: also, just cause 1 or 2 countries may blackball Bitcoin into oblivion and make it look unappealing to its citizens, doesn't mean the rest of the world will of course, and if one government begins buying up and stock piling bitcoins, you can be assured others will follow suit.

I'm not the biggest fan of Coinbase but this is kind of ridiculous, you expected Coinbase to refuse to co-operate? 
Coinbase is a business, they're not going to go against the grain when it comes to this sort of stuff, just like every other company, Facebook, Reddit, Google, *PokemonGo*, your mobile phone provider, your place of employment, your school/college, your bank, any other US based Bitcoin Exchange and many, many more companies/businesses that have customer information would cooperate with the government at the bat of an eyelid.

Gtfo, and don't hodl the door on the way out. 
We are 8 Years in, will you be singing the same tune ~~if~~ when bitcoin is still a thing in 8 more years? how about 18 years? 
I remember dismissing bitcoin a few years back as scam, i pardoned my ignorance because it was early days but i mean come on now, really? it will be 10 years old soon, if bitcoin turns out to be a sham, hats off to Satoshi for pulling it off.


We're closing in on the halfway point, and its going to be an interesting ride to bitcoins 20th birthday.


The real funny part to all of this, is deep down you *know* Bitcoin is here to stay or you wouldn't go so far out your way to try and blackball it flagman lol


Bought a pair of jeans and a pizza with bitcoin just the other day, Sell? **Bitcoiners** Hodl &amp; Spend.

Mining isn't advisable at this scale unless you have very cheap electricity and large amounts of money to spare, the days of mining from your home computer or in your garage for profit (imo) are long gone. 
Your best bet is to buy, don't assume the current price is too high because you can buy any amount of Bitcoin you can buy $2 worth if you really wanted, it's never too late to get into Bitcoin even if 1 Bitcoin was $100,000. 
I first had the opportunity to buy Bitcoin when the price was in the low 200's I decided it was too expensive and that I had already missed the train, forgot about it for a while, then stumbled on a video where Roger Ver said something like "Thinking its to late to get into Bitcoin, is like thinking its too late to get involved with the Internet"  I checked the price again and it had doubled. 
this is when I realised that the current price of Bitcoin is nothing compared to what it could be, if you built a time machine and went back to the days where Bitcoin was less than $10 and told them the current price in 2016 price is just shy of $700 you would have probably been laughed at, now take that same time machine and travel forward in time 10 or 15 years, there are only two scenarios the price of Bitcoin makes $700 look like absolute child's play or it is $0. 
If you can, aim for 21 bitcoin, because the amount of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million, this means only 1 million people could possibly own 21million Bitcoin, I think this is a fair amount and puts you in the 1/1000000th club - (only buy what's affordable, always remember there is risk, only buy if you believe in its future) 
Also I think is important to remember, Bitcoin shouldn't only be viewed as something that could possibly make you money in the future, the technology behind Bitcoin is incredibly ground breaking, the comparison to the Internet is no joke, we will all almost certainly be using blockchain technology in the future, Bitcoin I'm pretty certain will be a part of that (considering the Bitcoin Blockchain is THE Blockchain) any Bitcoin you buy today does not have to be bought just to be exchanged for traditional fiat in the future, there are many merchants that currently accept Bitcoin as a payment method included places like Overstock.co, Expedia and I'm pretty sure even Lamborghini. 
Merchant adoption is guaranteed to grow as the Bitcoin Blockchain grows and this grows every day, in a few years spending Bitcoin should be second nature to a lot of people (especially online) and you can spend your Bitcoin just as you spend your fiat, additionally Bitcoin can be used to make money transfers, you can send $1000000 for less than 10 cents to anyone and anywhere in the world, heck, if you knew someone living on Mars you could send him some Bitcoin if you wanted, and it would be instant and cost you next to nothing to do so. 
Welcome to Bitcoinland :) and enjoy being a bitcoiner.

He annoys me so much now, because he comes across as a liar imo, i dont think he believes half of what he says, i think he is *heavily* invested in Ethereum and he is determined to drive a massive wedge between Bitcoin and Ether.

Awesome, I would really love to see if there are any merchants out there that accept direct Bitcoin payments.

Spendabit.co is also a good place to check.

6% buying not sending/spending. 
Edit: also the ATM was just one example to an alternative to Coinbase. 
Sending Bitcoin from one address to another is free and practically instant. 
And no need for Coinbase (or any other 3rd party) to do that.

Glad you made the point about not keeping your funds on exchanges.

Yeah nothing wrong with making purchases using coinbase, but just have to remember to send your Bitcoin into a wallet you own.

They should award Satoshi the Nobel Prize, *and allow him to keep his anonymity, and not have to reveal his identity*

Well i wouldn't say that's the same thing, the whole point of bitcoin is you are your own bank, so you accept full responsibility of accepting the possibility of stolen funds, Whenever an article is posted by some company or persons bashing bitcoins, one of their main firing points is that Bitcoin wont work because there is no one to answer to in cases such as these which is why we need banks, but that point is thrown out the window if when situations like this occur the banks show you the door.
3:09 - "Why put money in the bank when this kind of shit happens"
And your right its not directly bitcoin related, but i felt like it was indirectly related as clearly he is not happy with his current banking system and sounds like he would benefit from an alternative, wouldn't you agree?
Maybe im wrong for posting it, i dunno.
