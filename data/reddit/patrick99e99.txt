One could just as easily argue that Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system was going along, and suddenly the developers started changing it into a pure "store of value" with little use, merchants were having to stop supporting it, and so Bitcoin (cash) diverged so that it could get back to being what it was:  a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  BTC is what really changed...  I actually wrote a comment giving an analogy to this using animals to help, I'll re-paste it here:
It’s like this: if you knew what made a duck because it was defined: “quacks, walks like a duck, has feathers, loves to swim, etc” and then you had a duck... and you knew it was a duck because it matched the definition... Then that duck somehow got injected with weird DNA altering nanobots and it started changing and its webbed feet and wings turned into hooves, and it turned pink and grew a curly tail and started snorting, no longer liked swimming but instead loved wallowing in the mud.. you wouldn’t say “hey look at that pink duck!” You’d have to admit that you now have a pig. So.... bitcoin was a duck, it got injected with DNA altering nanobots and started turning into a pig, and the duck lovers said “no!!!”, cloned it and gave the clone another injection that killed the nanobots, and it turned back into a duck. BTC stayed a pig (not matching the bitcoin description, therefore not bitcoin), and BCH is still the original duck (is bitcoin).

So much hate... Wow..  Well, I'm sorry.  All I can say is, let's see what you say later on this year when BCH is handling 50k txns per second and bitpay + other merchants are using BCH.

Yeah sorry, I didn't really feel motivated to prove a point because what you said was so ridiculous.  You realize the bottleneck in BTC is blocksize, right?  You realize that BCH does not have that bottleneck?  Check it out, 8MB worth of txn data in the mempool for BTC = 8 blocks over 10 minutes = 80 minutes for 8MB.  8MB worth of txn data in the mempool for BCH = 1 block over 10 minutes = 10 minutes for 8MB.  Guess what?  50k txns per second for BCH are coming this year!  Soooo...  whatever you think about how Bitcoin (cash) "would suffer equally if not worse if it had the same traffic as bitcoin (core)." is complete nonsense!

lol.  very informed you are (not).

Well, if you have two versions of a cryptocurrency and one is fast, cheap, and reliable..  and the other is slow, expensive, and unreliable..  it does not take a rocket scientist to tell which one people are going to use.

My eyes misread the title, I thought it said Bitcoin Cash, which is Bitcoin.

Keep repeating the words of other people without ever thinking for yourself!

I was mistaken, I thought we were talking about Bitcoin, not a fork of ZCash.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:53:06
I don't know anything about bcash.. That's a ZCash fork right?

What?  You don't like hosts who are rude and constantly interrupt their guests?
