That's pretty funny!  I've really gotten into this reddit space, I keep this screen up all the time so I don't miss anything, probably check in 10 times a day.  
How's life treating you?

Maybe not, but I think it's a only a matter of time that someone realizes the advantage of this model vs the one and done donations.  Right now, the one and done model is flying blind, no idea what kind of equipment or setup, no control over the marketing, etc...
Even if you didn't have regular donations, just raising $100k and shopping it to teams that are already established and are going to race with or without your money is the way to go.  And trust me, there's plenty of them still out there.  In this market, you could get 5-10 races as a co-primary in the CUP series with the right team as a partner and you could handpick the driver since it's your money.  With the right driver, I bet a network would get behind this and create a show around it, they're always looking for something new and different.
You could then benefit from the marketing in a unique way that the big teams would never even consider.  For example, you could get a driver that agrees to live stream his time at the shop or at track or grabs random fans off the street and takes them for a ride and pranks them.
Just sayin, there's ways to stretch the dollars and control the reach much better than by sponsoring 1 guy each time.  I don't think this audience understands how powerful they could become within the racing community, it has the potential of changing the rules....literally!

Thanks man, I've thought about crowdsourcing/funding a race team ever since I watched who wants to be a millionaire and was fascinated how the mob guessed the right answers 90+ % of the time.  I think these guys are brilliant that have come up with this cryptocurrency system.
What kind of business are you guys wanting to start?
