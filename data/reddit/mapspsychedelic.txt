Correct! If the Phase 3 trials show positive results, FDA approval for prescription use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for  PTSD is expected by 2021.

Founded in 1986, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana. **We accept Bitcoin donations** (as well as Ethereum and Litecoin).
MAPS was an early supporter of cryptocurrency donations, [first accepting Bitcoin donations in December 2013]( The cryptocurrency community has been eager to contribute to MAPS' work, and their gifts have helped fund MAPS' international psychedelic research, public education, psychedelic harm reduction, and advocacy projects.
In MAPS' completed Phase 2 trials with 107 participants, 61% no longer qualified for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy two months following treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, 68% no longer had PTSD. All Phase 2 participants had chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD, and had suffered from PTSD for an average of 17.8 years.
In August 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. MAPS and the FDA have also reached agreement under the Special Protocol Assessment Process (SPA) for the design of two upcoming Phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for patients with severe PTSD.
By granting Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the FDA has agreed that this treatment may have a meaningful advantage and greater compliance over available medications for PTSD.
As a non-profit with no government funding for psychedelic research, MAPS relies on contributions from individuals, businesses, and foundations to make psychedelic therapy a legal treatment. MAPS estimates that Phase 3 clinical trials will cost $26 million. With $15.5 million already raised or pledged, there's still a funding gap we need to close for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to become legally available to millions of people suffering with PTSD.
