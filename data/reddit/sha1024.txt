Some of those websites look pretty shitty, its hard to believe some of them are anything more than early domain name buyers. Honestly, who buys that many domains and magically gets a website up that fast. I think ill just send 5 BTC to each and that way I can maximize my chances of getting some to him and hopefully all of them go to the same place if we are lucky. :P

Agreed, the American economy is the way of the future. We aren't in debt, bitcoin is a far worse investment. The economy will not collapse in 2014/2015 even though economic forecasters everywhere say it will. Just put it all in banks that use computers to keep track of funds. It will all be fine, bitcoin is just a fluke and has nothing to do with whats coming in 2016 even though the blocks are in groups of 2016 its unrelated. Invest in gold, its good to eat and keeps you warm and dry, plus we use gold in almost every industry in the world. 
Buying all the sheeple a beer in BTC when 2016 rolls around. Hope to see you guys there ill screenshot my post as a prediction. Cheers!
