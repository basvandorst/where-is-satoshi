Ok that looks like a good alternative. Thanks 
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:04:19
Ok, thanks, you gave me an idea :)

It's weird, I received the BTC like 40-50 mins after he sent.. Oh well. Thanks for the help tho :):)
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:04:34
Lightening? :\

Your transaction is no longer in the mempool, which wallet are you using as you should be able to rebroadcast.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:42:14
Your transaction will be removed from the mempool and you’ll be able to rebroadcast your transaction.

Withdraw your bitcoin from gdax to the address on your ledger

The fee is not derived from the amount of bitcoin transacted, but instead it’s determined by how ‘heavy’ the transaction is - how many Bytes it is. This is determined by how many inputs the transaction has meaning the more difficult a transaction is to confirm for miners the more expensive it will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:26:28
I’ve tried this twice.. never worked :(. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:53:30
There are many API’s you can use that will give you the optimum fee to use. It’s calculated in satoshi per byte (sat/b), meaning the higher the bytes in a transaction the more fees. You can use blockcypher for the API
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:11:11
Sheesh looks like someone made a big mistake
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:46:18
Awesome, thanks so much.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:16:17
It’s confirmed 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:50:45
Perfect, how does this deal with the captcha ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:17:48
What relevance does this have to do with anything in this post? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:22:52
Coinbase has a lot of issues where transactions don’t get broadcasted etc - they use hot wallet and not cold wallet, so you don’t actually have full access to your funds. 
Wouldn’t recommend
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:04:56
You need chrome, press control+shift+I, click the console and paste the script in there, then press enter. You’ll need to be on the viabitcoin page with the form filled out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:49
You don’t need tampermonkey.
I’ll try my best to explain in the simplest form possible
Step 1: open google chrome.
Step2: go to viabtc Transaction accelerator.
Step 3: type in your transaction ID into the transaction ID section
Step 4: fill out the captcha.
Step 5: press control+shift+I all at the same time 
Step 6: click on console.
Step 7: copy and paste the script into the console
And press enter.
It will submit on the hour

I don’t think it’s something to do with other block
Explorers nodes rejecting the transaction, as it’s got a decent fee. I’m sending using blockcyphers api so it’s probably to do with that on second thought.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:01:19
I'm getting a "request too frequently" error message whenever I try to use this, do you know what to do?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:22:48
That’s the required fee to get it confirmed within the next block at the moment 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:09:50
Can somone explain what this means 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:26:14
Ok sweet, I’ll give this a try 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:31:02
The transaction will be eventually rejected and removed from the mempool. The funds will then return to the senders wallet, as though the transaction was never broadcasted.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:41:48
This is impossible unless your transaction was part of an orphaned block, could you share the TX
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:17:57
Bitcoin is so fragile in the early stages isn't it.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:09:33
They're closing it?? What do you mean
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:11:14
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:36:01
Ok, thanks. I'll try that one out.

Are online wallets untrustworthy ? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:07:33
Don't worry.

In the Bitcoin network, user transactions are grouped in blocks and recorded to a digital public ledger called a blockchain. Miners are in charge of this task, and receive a mining reward in the form of bitcoins for each block recorded.
The amount of bitcoins rewarded for each block decreases with time: it is halved every 4 years. This event, the moment when the mining reward is divided by 2, is commonly called "Bitcoin halving". Other denominations are used: "reward drop", "reward halving", or simply "the halving" or "the Halvening" which is a popular meme among bitcoiners.
When Bitcoin was created in 2009, the initial reward was 50 bitcoins. In november 2012, it dropped to 25btc after the first halving. The second halving will take place in July 2016, decreasing the reward to 12.5btc.

Oh right thanks for that 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:54:34
You can only select ‘regular’ or ‘economy’ fee. Other than that I don’t think there is any other options.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:01:50
Could you link me the transaction
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:52:17
Nope there is no risk, just make sure you own your private keys so you will have access to BTG when the fork occurs
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:57:54
Nah you don’t need to worry - nothing bad can happen. It’s only gonna take a little bit longer. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:05:31
Yeah that will definitely confirm, might just take a while. Should be a max of 3 hours.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:00:14
Most likely due to the upcoming fork on the bitcoin network where the bitcoin you have at the time of the fork will also give you access to ‘bitcoin gold’.
Bitcoin gold is another currency that potentially could have value in the future. 
However no one knows whether the new coin will have any value so make your own decision.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:09:04
Even if they don’t support it, you have full access to your private keys so there will always be a way 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:22:38
Use localbitcoins.com there are many sellers for NZD, although sometimes people charge slightly over market rate. Just make sure you pick someone with a good reputation. (It’s essentially Trademe but for bitcoins)
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:09:19
A fork, in simple terms, just means your private key has access to the new coin. You get the new coin for ‘free’ and you get the same amount of the new coin as have of bitcoin at the time of the fork.
It’s impossible to predict what will happen to the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:51:04
The new coins will be attached to your wallets private key - bread wallet will probably release an update a few weeks after the fork that allows you to withdraw your new coins to a new address. This is what occurred on the Bitcoin Cash fork.
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:43:20
What address did you originally send the funds to, I’ll check if they should be there.
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:44:16
I think your issue may be that the wallet is out of sync with the blockchain, meaning it will show up with 0 balance.
I’ve never used Jaxx, but there will probably be a sync with blockchain button somewhere.
pm me if you need further help 
@_date: 2016-10-23 11:21:44
Perfectly explained. Thankyou very much!
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:10:39
Do you have the TX id? Sounds like it's just awaiting confirmation still.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:16:10
Power cost &gt; bitcoin mined
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:49:16
Ok yes that would make sense as the other transaction got stuck. 
Do you happen to know what happens now/ how I can send the bitcoin on this wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:59:54
Ok thanks for the help, the transaction was sent via a node.js script just using the private keys so can't really do anything there. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:16:38
Ok, so what happens if the transaction never confirms? Like according to blockchain.info I have the bitcoin in my wallet, but not on blockcypher. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:42:40
The transaction is about a week old. 
Any idea why it's not showing up on blockchain.info?
Don't think I'm able to change fees 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:08:27
Ok that's what I was looking for thanks. If you don't mind me asking what was breadwallet missing for you? I just want to make sure I pick the correct wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:32:39
Yes it's perfectly safe 
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:53:04
Ok I'll do that then, thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:14:49
Ahhh yes! I did notice this. I actually messaged them and they said 'yes' to my question "will users be able to manually select fees in the future"
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:16:23
You were incorrect :\
