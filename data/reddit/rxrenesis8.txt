You need to be at a certain place in your stride at a certain part of the run up. If you are off pace and would jump too early/late you can see it. Same as any normal person trying to jump onto something, you can just tell the timing is wrong.

Can't do that if the item is price locked by the vendor or by price matching.

It's a completely different audience demographic primarily targeting older folks.
Each episode of 60 Minutes is watched by [11.4 million households]( on average during the live broadcast.
The last numbers I saw on JRE indicated around 5 million subscribers and each of his videos appear to be in the high hundred thousands to the low single-digit millions.

Both of the most recent editors were relatively "new" accounts (~10 posts each), I guess we'll see how long those edits last!
It is strange how most topics are soft-locked now though. I remember editing some fairly popular stuff before I ever had an account!

1. Dude waits tables poorly
2. Dude gets no poor or no tips
3. Dude gets paid a minimum wage regardless of tip situation and employer can make an informed decision to retain The Dude or not.
It does put you at the mercy of the patron though. If the boss uses only tips as a metric of job performance a few shitty patrons can ruin your record. I much preferred my job as a fancy janitor to my friends jobs in the service industry.

Put everything you can think of with a timestamp on it into a database. The wider the net you cast, the better. In a day or so when things have "settled" ask that question in the form of a self-post.
Someone with economics experience will love you forever.
Or maybe even pay you.

5% is an ass-number, as in: I pulled it out of my ass. I have no idea what the actual average exchange fee is.
A discount for cash? Only place I've seen this is at truck stops, though there has been legislation discussed recently (edit: in America) that would allow businesses to pass credit card fees along to the user.

Join a mining pool with a low withdraw limit. You can make about 1 bitcent per day with cheap consumer hardware. (I made about 3.6 bitcents yesterday with a Radeon HD7970, not really worth the noise and power consumption to me but certainly easy enough to get into)
Or you could just fish for these:

1.  List prices for goods and services in a stable currency
2. Convert price to BTC at time of purchase
3. Charge customer BTC amount + currency exchange fee (%5?)
4. Immediately exchange received BTC for stable currency of choice
Everybody wins?

I had never seen the various levels of locking available for today. I knew about locking controversial stuff and locking things of differing controversy levels with differing locks makes sense I guess.
Maybe the bitcoin article is something that's prone to drive-by-editing or vandalism?

Piggybacking on a top comment to provide a PSA:


The $2 part of this statement is not true (or, isn't legal at least). A chart with payscales by state [**can be found here**]( and [**an explanation of the law here**](
Basically it states that given a federal minimum wage of $7.25, an employer can subtract up to $5.12 per hour if a worker makes at least that amount in tips, bringing the employers portion of the paid wage to $2.13. 
**The service worker should never make less than the minimum wage even if they are not tipped at all.** 
If you are a service worker and your employer is stiffing you: do something about it (read the laws, inform them, and if that fails find out who they are accountable to).

I don't understand why this is even a post. Couldn't OP have edited the page with far less effort than it took to post this? 
It looks like someone saw this thread and cleaned it up a little anyway.

Thoughts become words, words become actions, it is thus that our steps are informed by idle musings and contemplation. 
When you let yourself fall prey to the trap of apathy and cynicism you make it that much more difficult for yourself and those around you to change in any meaningful way. 
Thought is power, the passion and persistance of an individual can bring low the mightiest of works, or raise new ones of uncompromising strength and beauty.
We could use more earnest men.

I think OP means something the average person would treat as money. Not just early adopters and speculators.

The two circles are not completely separate. I prefer to work and inform towards positive change rather than apathetically letting them slide further apart.
