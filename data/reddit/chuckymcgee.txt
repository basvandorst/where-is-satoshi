This isn't true though. Bitfinex can't spend client deposits on legal fees. If Bitfinex is liable, they'll be forced to spend their own assets satisfying judgments. Now, to be fair, it's likely that's only a teeny tiny amount of what was taken. 
On the other hand, 1. fuck them that's the concept of liability. And 2. If you've lost a couple hundred BTC and only a few others sue, yes, it's very possible for you to recover more than this haircut.

Classically crimes required an injured party, but that's not an actual barrier. Anything can be criminalized and there's no need to show an injured party as an element.  Drug possession is probably the most common- you were found with X grams of this prohibited substance, that's a crime. No need to show any injured party.


But not really. An entire body of governed people don't need to give active consent to every statute passed and enforced for it to have the force of law. It's more that every statute enacted into law has the implicit consent of the governed unless you have an overwhelmingly widespread revolution against the government or statute. Certainly statutes have force of law even if any particular individual refuses to consent to be governed;  a rapist is going to be imprisoned whether he consents to being governed or not!

@_date: 2016-08-18 23:25:56
These really don't add up to needs for most people. Most people don't send funds internationally, and once we consider the conversion fees at most exchanges to fiat the cost is not "for next to no fees".
That you don't need anyone's permission to do so is not a concern for the vast majority of transactions for the vast majority of people.
If someone steals your credit card info you really aren't liable for any costs.
Most people have such a trivial net worth there's not much worth protecting from a bank stealing.
Again, with a limited net worth, fiat inflation is more or less a non-issue.
Speculation is a possible bitcoin activity, but supply is just one factor among many dictating price. It's a volatile investment with enormous downside as well as upside. In any event this is a reason why someone *could* buy bitcoin more than why they should.

It's pretty cool and would definitely be very resilient, but I worry that something like this would draw more attention than something scrawled on paper. You would definitely need to secure this very, very well. 
Today it may be safe because of the sheer obscurity of the fact that one's entire Bitcoin funds can be accessed with a 12 word mnemonic key, but what happens when Bitcoin becomes more common place? When people see 12 random words very deliberately set in a shiny steel case and say "oh wow that's someone's bitcoin funds"? Then any set of prying eyes could take advantage of it. It'd be an immediate target for thieves,  untrustworthy housekeepers, etc. And if the price of Bitcoin appreciates much more, you've been known to have *some* investment in bitcoin, expect to be labeled "Bitcoin rich" and become a target.
You could store it in a safe deposit box and that probably is pretty secure, but even then you run a risk in the event of a government seizure. I think I'd probably want to encrypt it further, or divide up the mnemonic into multiple crytosteel devices placed with trusted associates.

Based on my experiences with my Chinese suppliers, not really. For one, you, as the buyer are often charged with your own wire fees and asked to pay the recipient's fees as part of the contract. Second, even if they did have to handle that, the relative cost of these bank fees is usually so trivial as to not justify the hassle or exchange fees of converting Bitcoin to yuan- you're talking about fees of maybe $30-$60 a transfer, and if you're sending $10-20k over at once it's really not that much.

This is such a shill of an argument. What percent of current miners can't handle 2 MB or 8 MB blocks? While there's some threshold at which you push the low-end of modern connections, we're nowhere near that with current proposed increases. And if miners are concerned about their blocks being orphaned, individuals are always free to cap the size of *their* blocks, as miners like Antpool do today.

Well you can make n of n wallets at least pretty easily manually- I think? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Give 3 unique words to 4 people for a 4 of 4? To be fair, it's probably not a true 4 of 4 in that you probably could brute force the remaining three words if you compromised 3 of 4. You could be redundant in handing out sets of 3 words, but this also doesn't mean any 4 individuals could reassemble the seed.
But nevertheless it means you'll succeed in having a non encrypted seed that would require multiple breeches in order to be compromised.
Or at least I think so. I may not be understanding the bit strength of these mnemonic strings well enough. How many words, knowing the order and placement, would an attacker need to have reasonable probability of deciphering the other keys, in say a month?

It's supposed to be what, a $1000 gamble though? And for a lot of people, especially those around here, the marginal cost of running some hardware they have lying around is maybe a $1 a month in electricity or so. So they'd practically have to get their full $1000 back to get to that point.
I run a full node which helps others, but I also run joinmarket, which pretty much needs a node and generates more than covers the small costs of electricity.

I mean there's a definite and very real tradeoff. If you try and rely on some password in your head, you or your loved ones could be completely screwed if something happens to you. You wouldn't even need to die, just some accident causing memory loss could totally wipe you out.
On the other hand, an unencrypted seed has to be protected extraordinarily well. Anyone who sees it could immediately take advantage of it and you'd have basically no recourse. I wonder if splitting the seed amongst trusted people with some redudancy would work. Your will would list the recipients.

I have setup a node with an RPi2 and recommend against it. I'll say that the RPi2 and 3 are really bottlenecked. 1 GB of RAM is wimpy, and the shared Ethernet/USB bus means you've got a theoretical max 480Mbps to download blocks, write to the blockchain, read from the blockchain and send that to other nodes. If you get a USB drive it needs to have a really decent IOPs, but even then it's bottlenecked. My drive got corrupted and had to be reindexed- it's been over 12 days and am still waiting. I was able to setup a netbook with Ubuntu, install the bitcoin client and download the entire blockchain from scratch in less than two days!
I think I'd recommend instead using a netbook, if you're going to do anything at home. Even then I'd caution people that they probably could be doing better things with their money.

BAHAHAHAHAHA! Yeah good luck estimating the difficulty rate increase over a 1-2 year period with *any* degree of confidence. 1-2 year break even translates to "probably never".


Yes, but by selling coins you give up the potential that they appreciate. By selling coins to buy a miner, you're betting that the miner can mine at least as many coins as you paid. If the price of Bitcoin *does* increase in the 1-2 years you'll be mining, you can bet the difficulty will spike as well, making it highly unlikely you'll come out ahead relative to holding.

A form of money will replace the government? What.


It would have to be the outright end of a functional blockchain, a destruction of Bitcoin to function as a transaction network. When a person can't send Bitcoin to another person with an address anymore, that's the end of Bitcoin. Which I agree is essentially impossible, because you can't ban math.
But the government definitely can make it so no one above-board can or would want to accept Bitcoin for goods or services or fund Bitcoin-related activities and so that anyone publicly doing so would be punished. And if you can't publicly use something to buy goods and services it's not really money. Something limited to a mere token in some subset of underground transactions really isn't money.  Hence the government could destroy bitcoin as money.
Money is an invention of humanity, but money derives from having utility as a medium of exchange in transactions. And as the state can most definitely impair the ability of something to be used in transactions, the state can certainly destroy something to be used as money.

I think there is a difference in quality between your run of the mill watch and something fancy, and paying this much lets you get something reasonably close to the original in terms of quality and appearance without paying close to the price for the real thing. I think you say "I want something that looks and works like a Rolex, something that pretty much anyone short of an experienced jeweler with a magnifying glass would identify as a real Rolex" and go from there.  You don't want to get a $10 watch that hardly works, feels cheap and looks like it's had a Rolex logo glued on.
This requires that you actually have a desire to own the real thing in the first place, which is something a little more difficult for me to comprehend.  I think it's mostly something for an older generation and young associates trying to compare dick size in the office.

That's such vague anarchist bullshit propaganda.  If a government were to ban Bitcoin, you'd dramatically cripple how you could buy it and where you could use it. Unless you're suggesting passing Bitcoin regulation would lead to violent overthrow of the government, which is ludicrous.
If a ban was enacted, would above-the-board shops and retailers be willing to accept Bitcoin? Nope. Is Walmart going to be putting up a signs? Nope. Your little Mom &amp; Pop coffee store? Nope. Are banks going to allow transfers to any exchanges? Nope. Localbitcoins? Seized. Are courts going to recognize disputes involving owed damages in Bitcoins? Nope. Are exchanges going to be able to operate in the open online? Nope. Is Bitcoin going to be traded on a major exchange and the price reported like any major commodity? Nope. ATMs? Nope.
Sure, a government can't *destroy* Bitcoin entirely. Someone, somewhere will be always be able to maintain the blockchain and people can transact under the cover of night, in the darknet if they really want to. But limiting Bitcoin's ability to be used as a store of value to be exchanged for goods and services directly limits its value and function as money. Money without utility really isn't money at all. Governments can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can destroy Bitcoin as money.

Your examples are actually evidence there is significant demand for an ETF. 
Mt Gox and other shady, unregulated exchanges are precisely why many big investors have stayed out. A fund regulated by the SEC on a major platform is a big boon for Bitcoin, as investors looking to buy on a regular exchange suddenly have that option.
The fact that Gold and Silver ETFs have flourished is also evidence of the popularity of indirect asset holding. Lower transaction costs and no need to secure the asset itself is a major convenience for investors.
You certainly can raise all sorts of reasons why you or a lot of people might prefer cold storage, but that doesn't negate the fact that there's still significant interest in ETF holdings.

@_date: 2015-12-12 05:10:38
Because not everyone is a market participant now. You're assuming everyone who could participate in bitcoin already knows about it. But they don't. When you have new players and participants coming to the market post halving, you create a massive and unanticipated liquidity crunch which could drive the price further upward.
Now I'm not saying that it will happen, but I'm providing an explanation as to why the market wouldn't fully price in the halving.

Gosh, I was looking for it myself, couldn't find it.
Here goes:
So global wealth is disproportionately concentrated. If the distribution of bitcoin wealth follows that of global wealth, we can estimate someone's (rough) standing based on the percentage of bitcoin they possess. It's going to be far dicier at the tippy top, but it's a better ballparking tool than just dividing 21 mill by how much you own.
[Global wealth is $421 trillion]( Holdings of $3.5 billion puts you in the top 500 individuals, according to Forbes. That's 8.31X10^-6 of all wealth. Having that portion of bitcoin, (assuming 21 million bitcoin, which is impossibly high) requires 174.6 bitcoins. $1 billion puts you in the top 1714. So that requires 49.9 BTC.
[Moving on down, there are an estimated 172,850 people worth $30 million or more.]( That would be just 1.5 BTC. 
[An estimated 14.6 million people are worth over $1 million] ( That works out to just .05 BTC to join the top 14.6 million. Which makes sense, because how many people actually hold bitcoin?
So I think you're joining a far more rarified club with 21 BTC. You're probably in the top 100,000 or so globally. Not saying that'll ever make you a multi-deca-millionaire, just defining how you rank in terms of your holding of one particular asset.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:47:33
And honestly even better than that at the very worst given how many coins have and will be destroyed.
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:31:55
That's fascinating. However, with basically zero BIP 101 mining power, this scenario seems like a ways off, right? What triggers a BIP 101 fork?
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:10:49


Thank you for noting this. We have no idea how many bitcoins have truly been lost, but documented cases amount to tens of thousands to something just shy of 100,000. And those are just major publicly announced losses! How many early miners tried mining a few blocks and then forgot about the $1 or two in coins they had when they reformatted their hard drive? Or encrypted a file and forgot the password? Or had a fraction of a coin somewhere and just forgot? Or sent coins to an address they couldn't access?
I've seen reports that as much as 1/3rd of coins haven't been moved in the last few years or so. Now a lot of those are probably HODLRs, but some of those have probably been lost. It wouldn't surprise me if several million BTC have been totally lost. We may never see even close to 20 million coins in existence.
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:07:01


Wait sorry, so gold is not an unregulated pseudo-anonymous currency/commodity? The stock market and other assets have never had their value tampered with by bad actors spreading rumors or leaking information? Or did I completely destroy your objections to a Bitcoin ETF and you have nothing of substance to respond to?

@_date: 2015-12-04 07:56:27
That's fair. But I'd say the expected value of mining and accepting transactions with fees generally exceeds the expected value of mining while refusing transactions and fees. Every miner has to calculate that for himself. So while there certainly are situations where a miner might not accept transactions, it's unfair to say it is against a miner's self interest to consistently accept them.

I don't quite understand that sort of decision-making. If I'm a miner and know my yields are going to be halved, wouldn't I only invest in mining equipment if I'm certain the price is going to at least double around the halvening? Considering that I see difficulty ramping up and probably not stopping, why would I pour more money into equipment that's going to see well below half the current yield BEFORE the halvening? Why wouldn't I just buy BTC?

This is an incredibly significant factor. We have no idea as to just how many coins are actually spendable, but there could be several million coins lost already. This means actual inflation as a percent is larger and the market cap is smaller. It suggests that the halvening could have a more profound impact on supply. It also suggests theoretical per-bitcoin prices based on matching other assets might be much higher.

It's an overpriced raspberry pi bitcoin node for $400. It also has a crappy mining unit attached to it, the paid shills will say. When you point out that the crappy mining unit is basically going to mine maybe .2 BTC in it's lifespan and is therefore hardly worth an additional $300-$350 when you can buy way more than that right now, they'll say you don't understand, it's for development purposes, etc.
It's basically a shit node that forms a Venn diagram of cost, returns on in investment and easy of use that matches neither with a developer, a n00b or a casual miner looking for a return.

I agree that there are situations within the digital realm that are less than settled law, but what's so novel here? Certainly there are questions of facts to be resolved, including the means the FBI used to obtain this evidence, but if that matter of fact is decided in Ulbrich's favor, that the FBI's search was unconstitutional, excluding that evidence as a matter of law seems of limited difficulty.
TLDR; It's something to be resolved as a matter of fact but not something especially novel as a matter of law.

It's a poor analogy. If Netflix *could only offer one resolution of video*, and by offering only HD any slow internet users, including China, would be cut off from using Netflix, should Netflix max out its resolution to 240p?
That's the analogy. And it's a nuanced answer. 1080p might be too much for a lot of people. A lot of people might sometimes be able to accommodate 1080p, but it could be a big strain on their systems or internet connection data cap. They might have to shutoff other systems or applications just to be perfectly sure they'd be able to watch Netflix. And that'd be annoying and take a huge chunk of people out of Netflix. Because remember, you couldn't just step down to a slower bandwidth and keep watching smoothly, it would just be a bunch of glitches and jerks.
240p would be watchable, but not up to most users expectations. Everyone could watch, but the experience wouldn't be as enjoyable. 240p looks pretty darn mediocre on any ordinary set. 
So the right answer would probably be somewhere in the middle. 480p is a resolution people watched movies in for decades. DVDs are still pretty darn watchable, even if they don't offer the best cinematic experience. And new technologies like upscaling do help to squeeze a bit more out of that limited resolution for those with better setups. Nearly every near-broadband connection can accommodate 480p. And while you would alienate a portion of your userbase, it probably would be way smaller than the number you'd lose forcing everyone to use just 240p or 1080p.

I'm calling serious bullshit. Nothing he links to backs up his claim the Canadian government making any warning whatsoever. I did a bit of digging and all I can find is mention of a Canadian TV news correspondent Neil MacDonald warning viewers not to take money into the US. Canadian TV News Correspondent ~= Canadian Government ~=Canada
Additionally, it's total bullshit that Canadians have had $2.5 billion in seizures. The Washington post article discusses civil forfeiture, but makes no mention of Canada or anything to suggest $2.5 billion has been seized from Canadian travelers. The Washington Post article says that $2.5 billion TOTAL has been seized from ALL individuals not charged with a crime. Looking at the Washington Post map, the majority of money seized by civil forefeiture has come from southern border states, not the north, probably mexican drug gangs. Canadians are just an eensy teensy bit.
Civil forfeiture may be a serious issue, but this article is a journaiistic turd. Canada's not warning anyone and seizures affecting Canadians are nowhere near $2.5 billion.

I agree that while it's essentially impossible to generate this specific address by chance, we're looking at this ex-post. What's to say that someone didn't setup a bunch of rigs to generate vanity addresses until ONE address that looked "interesting" enough showed up and then named their burn project that? There are trillions or more of possible addresses which would work here that you or I would accept as being something they couldn't generate by chance alone.
Now I still think the odds of that are pretty dismal even with a bunch of powerful GPUs, especially if you're going to demand a format of "1-word-word-singlecharacterrepeated".

You're running into two separate issues, protection against self-incrimination and the requirement to comply with court orders to disgorge funds. Self-incrimination concerns are going to exist before and during trial. After you've been sentenced though, that's not a problem.
The issue against turning over private keys pre-trial is that not only do private keys allow Feds to access the money, knowledge of the private keys is pretty damn good evidence you own the Bitcoins or at least have some level of involvement with the transactions.


If you've been found guilty and the court has ordered to disgorge the ill-gotten proceeds, you must transfer the funds if you have control over them. You will be held in contempt of court and imprisoned indefinitely until you comply. Unless it's actually impossible for you to access the funds (or contact someone who could access the funds, provide information to access the funds, ANYTHING) you will continue to be imprisoned. 
You'd have to describe your hypo a little better. Uncooperative foreign bank? Are you saying it just seized all your funds and has just taken all your money? If you actually have no bonafide access to your funds whatsoever I guess they'd have to let you go. But if there's anyway you could do anything or tell someone something to get access to those funds you'd have to assist.
Of course, all of this runs into the serious evidentiary issues. How can the Feds even know if you've turned over all of your private keys? Without enough knowledge on their part, you may be able to get away turning over just a fraction of your assets.
As far as precedent for compliance with offshore accounts, there's a great case of these convicted scam artists who had hidden their money offshore and argued they didn't have access to it anymore. Court ended up imprisoning them for 3 or 4 years, then the feds eventually got the bank itself to hand over some money. I'll post it when I find it.

A credit card company basically acts as an escrow insurance with prompt and guaranteed payment. A stolen credit card purchase doesn't cost innocent users anything directly. Merchants are not liable for fraudulent transactions which are properly verified according to the credit card companies standards (matching CVV number, correct billing address, etc.). Card companies take the beating for fraud generally, not merchants. Card companies pass along those costs in the form of processing fees to merchants and other account fees to consumers.
I run an ecommerce business and there's no way an escrow service could provide the same level of convenience, speed, security and acceptance of credit card processing. With credit cards, someone checks out, gives me their CC info, the transaction is approved and I ship the same or next day. The card company confirms the payment within a day and the money post to my bank account in 2-3 business days, whether or not the customer has gotten their product. 
An escrow service would delay all that. My money would be on hold until the customer confirmed receipt or some predetermined deadline expired, which with some international shipments could be two or three weeks. And there still would be a fee associated. My CC fees average a bit over 2%, it's something but not oppressive.
I do accept direct Bitcoin payments, but never see myself stopping credit card transactions, even if Bitcoin became the only currency in the world. Credit cards, even if they're denominated in bitcoin, provide all sorts of additional benefits that Bitcoin alone cannot which make consumers willing to buy things from me. Customers know they're protected, are familiar with transactions and can quickly make purchases which I receive payment for. The line of credit they're given makes them able to spend money they don't have, which makes them willing to buy things from me- and I don't lose a dime if they can't pay the credit card companies back.

American Express has recently introduced a number of semi-prepaid debit card options like Bluebird aimed at the poor. It's almost like a checking account, but with some limitations designed to cut down on risks associated with poor people. So, for instance, every check you write has to have an authorization number from Bluebird's website written down confirming you have the funds. This reduces the risk you bounce a check.
There are very minimal fees. I think AMEX is looking to pick up some merchant fees from a group of people that are mostly cash only.

It certainly indicates a very rapid increase in hash rates and that's no doubt a good thing. However the fact that halving dates have moved so much from the target reveals certain elements and variables that the bitcoin protocol failed to anticipate when it was conceived. Only adjusting the difficulty every 2016 blocks or ~2 weeks fails to keep difficulty in check with hash rates when you have such tremendous growth. As a result, bitcoin creation rates are not quite as constant and predictable as the original protocol intended- despite a predictable supply being one of bitcoin's strong points.
It's mostly an intellectual hurumph than any practical concern. I'd take explosive growth that shakes up the protocol's careful planning a tad any day over stagnant or meager growth.

So long as rates and terms are clearly disclosed up front, I see no reason why people shouldn't be able to loan money at any rate they both agree on. Rates are set that high because poor people are really risky to lend to- they're obviously in a questionable financial situation and have almost no assets to take if they're unable to pay their loans. If you limit the rates at which people lend, you'll just have poor people that no one is willing to give money to.

Holding a private key paper backup lets you hold bitcoin the way holding a key to a safe full of gold is considered holding gold.
With all of these backup methods, you aren't backing up the bitcoins themselves, you're backing up the private key. What you're holding when you hold a paper wallet it isn't a physical backup of your bitcoins, it's a physical copy of a right to access the bitcoins at a particular address.
You can never really physically possess a bitcoin, only the recognition of ownership rights as a private key. A private key doesn't change based on how many bitcoins are in an address, so it follows that a private key cannot be said to actually be a bitcoin.
Your analogy then isn't solid. A book contains all of the information of a story.  If it didn't contain all the information, it wouldn't be a physical representation of that story. But the data of a private key backup doesn't contain information about the bitcoins in it. If the number of bitcoins at an address increases, the private key doesn't change. Yet the backup still allows access to those new bitcoins. Why? Because the backup is a key, not the bitcoins themselves.
If these keys are not the bitcoins themselves, it follows that the backups are not bitcoins. You cannot hold a physical bitcoin.

"Misinterpretation" seems to be a bit of an misstatement. It's not that these policies were misinterpreted, it's that they weren't really able to be definitively understood to begin with. My understanding is that PRC often deliberately drafts statements or policies which are vaguely worded and can then be easily enforced one way or another, depending on the whims of government officials. This can allow the government to maintain a facade of consistency should they change their mind. It may also facilitate the offering of bribes to ensure favoritism. I wouldn't be surprised if some substantial payments were made to government officials by BTCChina to ensure officials "clarified" that the rules didn't apply to Bitcoin exchanges. That's often how business gets done in China.
Pure speculation on my part, I realize. But it's not as though BTCChina essentially shut down because it was too stupid to understand PBOC rules.

Ah, I feel for you. Paypal is notorious for reversal and an electronic good is going to be a hot target. Extraordinarily easy to scam, a whole different can of worms. But that's a Paypal reversal issue, not a credit card chargeback issue. Credit cards handle fraud and chargebacks much differently.
I tried to use Paypal on my website when I first started because of the ease.

You'll have dumbed-down services that look like a Paypal interface and work over the Bitcoin platform. It'll have all sorts of dumbed-down options that reduce the risk people screw themselves over too badly.
Optional features for dumb people:
**Limit outgoing transactions to recognized parties only**- So your grandma wanted to send 1 BTC to 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy and instead typed in 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnylWrnqRhWNLy. On a regular wallet, she'd be SOL. 
In this system though, she's also asked to enter the recipient's email address. The system will only allow transfers to other registered users on the system. If the bitcoin address she entered doesn't match the wallets registered with the system for that email address, the system refuses to send the bitcoins.
Merchants wanting to use the service would register and/or integrate it into their checkout platforms so the address is passed along seamlessly to the service.
**2-FA password recovery service**
By implementing the standard password recovery features used on ebanking and other credit card platforms, the system keeps track of the user's password. The user never has direct access to their wallet and the service itself has access to her password
**Not getting all her Bitcoin stolen**
Because of the 2-FA standards, Grandma is no more likely to have her bitcoin funds stolen than a regular bank account. Now if Grandma gets scammed and decides to send all her bitcoins to a thief, then that's another story.
Yes, there are downsides and inconveniences to everything mentioned.  Security features could be set to different levels of stupidity. But it puts the security and ease of use on par with a Paypal or bank account, which hundreds of millions of people manage to trust and use just fine.

You never HAD to engage the state to pass on money. It provides additional failsafes not provided by your system. Entering an address that may not be accessible years into the future isn't necessarily wise. The beneficiary you designate could lose the private key in that time, or could die in that time and forget to leave their heirs proper decryption instructions for the empty address. Also, if the first beneficiary dies, it's quite possible that the person you'd want to receive the funds would NOT be the heirs of that beneficiary. You create an added layer of complexity in this case for your heirs- your funds have been suddenly transferred to an address your heirs have no direct control over and for which you cannot provide decryption instructions. The heirs of the beneficiary may be unable or unwilling to transfer the funds to your intended heirs. It could be very messy.

It's just more of an accounting hassle than anything, not a transactional one. I imagine businesses with wage workers probably wouldn't want to pay daily because of this hassle and also the fact that it allows them a bit of a float. Bitcoin isn't going to affect those issues.

There's the element of security and accessibility as well. ETF shares are very secure and fraud can be reversed, making traders more comfortable. ETFs can be purchased on many secure brokerage platforms which traders are familiar with and are comfortable funding. All transfers into the Bitcoin ETF from the view of banks will just be from checking accounts to registered brokerage firms, so people won't have to deal with the paranoia of banks in purchasing BTC. 
Additionally, the ETF will further add to Bitcoin's legitimacy as an asset. Financial news sites may be more willing to report the price of Bitcoin on a regular basis as they can confidently display the fluctuations of Bitcoin as easily as any other ETF as opposed to the current janky exchanges with sometimes glitchy price reporting.
I think the ETF will signal the beginning of a new era in Bitcoin; one in which Bitcoin is commented and reported on through mainstream sources as commonly and authoritatively as one would see reports on the price of gold or silver or the Yen.

A digital currency isn't a digital currency because people use it to buy things. It's a digital currency because it's represented by binary digits, 0s and 1s. Bitcoin is a digital currency existing on a computer network. It's a digital currency and a virtual currency.
Nothing limits a virtual currency to only being used to purchase virtual goods. Just as nothing limits a physical currency to purchase virtual goods. A currency being virtual or physical has no restrictions on what it can actually buy. I think you want to believe that "virtual" means "imaginary" or "not real", which is not the case here.

Except the purpose here is not to advertise a competing product, it's to ridicule and parody Western Union's business model. It's not a product being advertised- No one owns Bitcoin and this is not advertising any particular bitcoin service or even a particular bitcoin mode of transfer. The image is always presented along-side Western Union's ad, because the parody doesn't make sense unless you've seen Western Union's ad.
You're tripped up and think Bitcoin is a particular commercial service. It's not. No one directly profits from this. If the ad had been parodied instead as paper cash- $0 fees, Pickup "anywhere you can throw a wad of bills", it becomes obvious that it's not an ad.
If the ad had been redone for say, Coinbase, or done by Coinbase, then yes, it's arguably an ad, done for commercial gain, not a parody and wouldn't be protected.

Nothing. This situation has occurred with individuals refusing to hand over bank account information for offshore accounts holding the proceeds of fraud. You could be jailed for contempt of court until you comply. But this is a substantially greater hurdle for the government compared to simply freezing accounts or raiding your home.
It would require a conviction and court order, and that takes government resources and time, at the very least.
Government would have to actually know which coins are yours and exactly how many you have. Tough unless they've been sleuthing hard.
If the charges you're facing are so serious you'd probably never get out (DPR's running Silk Road and paying for a hit), you'd likely avoid ever giving out that info.
In any event, Bitcoin prevents the near automatic freezing of funds that would be carried out by every bank and financial institution with an account in your name.

I think "digital currency" alone doesn't adequately distinguish bitcoin from more traditional currencies,  the majority of which are in digital form and change hands through purely digital means. Bitcoin certainly is a digital currency, but as a virtual currency I feel you're better getting at the uniqie networked nature of bitcoin. Bitcoin exists because of its computer network. 
But my whole point here is that either term is fine and just because a media source calls it a virtual currency doesn't mean it misrepresents or dismisses bitcoin.

But a few Gbps is a pretty steep demand. Many of the world's connections can't consistently deliver those speeds and even if they can, it still represents an enormous consumption of bandwidth. A full node able to download the block could be unable to propagate the block to multiple connections in a timely manner. Sure, it's not insurmountable, and it could be fairly trivial in 10 years, but bandwidth demands are still the biggest technical limitation in Bitcoin becoming a primary payment mechanism for the world.

"There's a legal system in place to handle disputes that I already pay for through taxes."
Sorry, no. The charge back system is far faster and easier. I had a situation where I had purchased a grand in supplies for my company on CC. The supplier never delivered, my calls weren't returned and I had no way of contacting them.
Let's see how this would have played out in our court system:
1. File a claim in small claims court. The company was in another state 1500 miles away, so I may have jurisdiction issues, may need to consult an attorney
2. Wait and receive trial date, usually 3-4 months out, at least.
3. Attend the trial. Argue my case. Probably win. Other company may or may not have showed up.
4. Obtain a judgement for $1000. Hope they pay me back.
5. If they don't,  attempt to enforce the judgement. Since the other company is in another state I may have trouble enforcing that judgement. May need cooperation with another court, requiring more paperwork. 
6. Sheriff goes and seizes assets to satisfy judgement.
Time- 3-9 months, plus court fees,  possible attorney fees, strong possibility of messing up. Need to pay bill during 3-9 month wait
How it actually played out with a chargeback:
1. Called the credit card company. Waded through some menus, got to a live person,  explained the situation. Pointed out the transaction. Rep said the charge back had been filed and that the contested transaction would be flagged so that no payment needed to be made and no interest would accrue until this was worked out.
2. A week later, received a call that the merchant was still uncooperative.  The transaction was officially wiped from my bill.
Time- 20 minutes to know I wouldn't need to pay anything,  a week until I heard the final say. No need to be out the cash while I waited.

I'm just not a fan of people thinking they can time the markets generally. Notice I didn't say it was a good time to buy, just not a bad one. If you want to hold Bitcoin, you're doing it because you think the value will increase long-term. If that's the case, odds are you'll do better by investing sooner.
If recent events have changed your views on Bitcoin's future, then sell, and probably sell right away. But playing the markets, trying to time the bottom etc. is just a loser's game.

That's so absurd I find it unbelievable a teacher would actually write it. The idea that Ponzi schemes would fulfill the requirements for a speech on technological innovations is also unbelievable.
The sheer fantastical nature of this leaves me questioning whether or not you simply scrawled out a speech in a child's handwriting and wrote pretend angry teacher comments in order to secure karma, gold and bit tips. I apologize if I'm incorrect, but I simply need more evidence.
If you can comfortably do so, please provide additional information corroborating this happened as you say. Evidence that you have a 10 year old son (possibly his school ID, picture of his room, picture of the kid himself, picture of yourself) that he had a speech to write (paper of the assignment) and that his teacher did write that (name of the school, name of the teacher, class being taught) would all be helpful. Obviously privacy concerns here could make a parent uncomfortable posting some of these things, but I think some of these are innocuous enough that you can bolster your story without compromising anyone's privacy.

It's setup through Broad. I act as trustee in managing the funds in the 401k trust. 5500 filings are not required if the value of the funds are less than $250,000. I'll likely value the Bitcoin at bitstamp's average 24-hr price as of December 31st. If the IRS wants me to use a different value, they can tell me. Since it's a Roth and tax has already been paid on the contributions, it's not as though my valuation of the 401k investments really has any impact on immediate tax payments. After-tax money goes into an investment which isn't a prohibited transaction, investments stay there inaccessible until I retire, what's the IRS going to care about?

The bitcoin network doesn't work with a single fiber link, it's a robust decentralized network. To run that you'd need pretty much every active node's connection able to handle that kind of bandwidth. It's not a single fiber link, it's every link on the whole network. The overwhelming majority of network connections today cannot transfer at 1 Gbps. The few that can are unlikely to be willing to dedicate nearly all of their available bandwidth to running a node. If the block size changed to the levels requiring Gbps transfer rates tomorrow, you'd basically have a nonfunctional network.

I hold Bitcoins in my company's 401k, setup through Broad. It would be pretty simple to prove ownership of Bitcoins, should the IRS inquire. My company cuts a check to the 401k trust in the amount that payroll records indicate I have designated of my salary to go into the 401k trust account. The check is deposited into the trust checking account. Those funds are moved into a Coinbase account in the name of the 401k trust and Bitcoins are purchased, then transferred into an offline wallet, which the blockchain indicates no further transfer of funds. When the value of the 401k account reaches the required threshold, I'll file the required paperwork with the IRS. The paper-trails a mile long. What's the IRS going to dispute? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:39:02
The IRS has something like 3 years to audit you after the date you file a return and can file extensions as necessary. The fact that you got a refund doesn't mean that bitcoins can be considered short-term capital gains according to the IRS. Refunds basically go out as long as your math checks out, more or less. That doesn't make you immune from future scrutiny and an audit. The IRS has nothing on file to reconcile your extra tax reported. No one should rely on your current experience as any sort of legal protection or precedent.
That being said, good job for reporting your income as you did ans you probably made the right classification for your income. Short-term capital gains get taxed at the full rate of ordinary income, so it's not as though the IRS can demand more tax if it views it as some other type of income. Also makes me think they wouldn't bother with an audit in the first place. 
Long-term capital gains treatment for bitcoin is a bit trickier. My guess is they'll see bitcoin as an eligible asset and not as a collectible coin, but you never know.

Filed in a state which doesn't have annual filing costs. There's no income to pay taxes on, one because of the nature of the account and two because there hasn't been a realizable event. The annual fees for the 401k/IRA are a bit under a grand, which is high as a percent, but can be paid separately from the contributions. The returns from being able to invest in Bitcoin have easily outweighed whatever extra costs I have compared to a low-fee index fund. 
It certainly is more probable that I'm audited, but I really don't worry about the 401k being an issue. Since all tax have been paid on the contributions as a Roth, there are no unpaid taxes or improper deductions to come after me for. At the very worst they just decide it's not really a Roth 401k and that I will eventually owe taxes on my gains.
I agree it's a bit messy and not for everyone. But being able to have completely tax-free gains on my bitcoins is an enormous benefit which makes it worth it for me.

Depending on how it's stored online, it could make you more vulnerable to a rusty pipe attack. An encrypted file which is obviously a wallet on your dropbox account ties the file to you. This makes it much harder to deny ownership of Bitcoins as you are beaten with a rusty pipe versus physical backups which are inaccessible, not traceable to you or whose contents cannot be discerned.
If the online file is discretely labeled, then a tip of the hat and I'll be on my way.

Pick up a cheap netbook on eBay. I just picked up an Acer Aspire One with 1.4 GHz DC Celeron, 4 GB of ram and a 500 GB HDD for $130 with shipping. That's a self-contained all you need unit to run a very solid node. Less than 10 watts when running as a node with the screen off, small enough and low enough heat you could slip it under your couch.
Is this the absolutely cheapest way? No. You could choke it out with an RPi and an attached HDD. Transfer speeds will suck balls even over Ethernet, it'll be a hassle to setup compared to a netbook, it'll take a week or more to perform the initial sync. Once it is setup, the unit will be too preoccupied to do much of anything else. When you consider this and the fact that your savings are going to be pretty minimal to honestly non-existent if you don't have cables, keyboard, mouse and a monitor lying around, the netbook should get serious consideration.

Mostly speculation. When you tally up estimates of Satoshi's holdings, along with large losses reported, you're already well above 1 million. Contemplate the millions of coins mined before Bitcoin was worth even a dollar and you get a sense of the level of security most casual miners would place on protecting their wallets or making sure transactions are done properly. I don't doubt that there have been hundreds to thousands of losses of 1 BTC or more that the owners simply didn't bother to report because it was so trivial at the time.
Looking at the lack of activity from early mined coins is at least consistent with this theory, though I'll admit that simply because coins haven't moved doesn't mean some hodler isn't taking good care of them:

The assertion is that it will never again drop below 1000. You appear to dispute this by citing price recovery from the PBoC regulation, but that caused the price to drop below 1000. It's not unreasonable to imagine a similar negative event which will cause a similar drop below 1000. An absolute certainty that the price will never dip below 1000 is then unfounded.

I don't believe the SEC has ever released any decision on this ETF on any day other than the deadline.

It's not necessarily the case that Mastercard is lobbying against bitcoin. Mastercard might want to incorporate Bitcoin into its business model. It has a robust infrastructure that could make it possible to easily transfer bitcoins using existing POS systems. A company like Mastercard could assume (and actually prevent) any of the risk associated from a double-spend attack all while providing bitcoin in a system customers and merchants are familiar with. Obviously they'd attach a fee, but that fee could be lower than current debit cards if they don't have to provide a cut to a bank.
Actually getting regulatory approval for a complex scheme like that would require a good deal of lobbying still.

I don't know the criteria used by the SEC. If they have to cite some specific reason to deny the fund, otherwise it's approved, I think there's a very high probability. If, on the other hand, they can choose to deny any fund simply because they don't like it, I think it's lower, but not too low.
If the ETF does get approved, hold on to your butts.

XBT is used because of the nomenclature used for forex currencies trading ticker symbols.  For state-specific  currencies, the first two letters are used to convey the country and the third the currency- USD, GBP, JPY, CNY- US dollars, Great Britain pounds, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and so forth. For stateless currencies, an X is used as the first symbol. Gold and silver trade as XAU and XAG. So bitcoin, when included on this platform, will likely use XBT to follow the standards.

It's not a great argument, but it's to say a $100,000 bitcoin isn't so large as to require some massive upending of the financial system. It doesn't require an abandonment of fiat and other assets. At $100,000 Bitcoin is well recognized as a safe-deposit asset by the global financial community. Price movements are reported on daily on financial channels, the same way the Dow, gold, the Yen and Yuan are mentioned. Not *everyone* holds Bitcoin, but it's relatively common to hear suggestions of putting 1%-5% in Bitcoin, the same way you hear about gold today. Possible? I don't see why not. Inevitable? Nope.

For one, the 1% is not some monolithic entity. You don't get a card or something in the mail when you've become a doctor or whatever.
Secondly, the catapulting of a couple people to wealth isn't some magical Bitcoin novelty. Any successful startup does that to lots of people all the time.

There's *always* going to be some level of uncertainty in your assessment of *any* news as an investor in anything. How do you deal with uncertainty in any situation? OPEC says they're reducing production, some countries admit they might cheat and maintain a higher production level more than OPEC says. What do you do? You probably form some internal probability production will be cut by a certain level and respond accordingly. You can't know, but you can guess.
There may be some value claimed to fabricating the loss of Bitcoin. Simply because there would be a benefit to fabricated something doesn't necessarily mean a large number of reports have been fabricated. The actual marginal gain to any one person from claiming a loss is going to be relatively negligible, especially considering the time they'd have to wait to realize these possible gains. Very often the individuals reporting these losses have enjoyed a generally decent reputation and history. To suggest there would be mass fabrications would likely suggest some sort of mass conspiracy or lying. Sure, some could be wrong, but the probably all or most are fabricated seems a bit too far.
The millions of coins which have been lying dormant and unmoved for years are at least not inconsistent with the idea that a million or more coins may have been lost. You can't know for sure, obviously. Trying to claim that every single bitcoin ever mined **is** accessible or will be refound is the more implausible claim. 
It's not hard to lose coins- I've lost over a dozen myself, and this is when the price was in the hundreds of dollars. When the price was below a dollar, precautions individuals took would have been even lower. Without needing to make much, if any additional investment to mine, most individuals would have considered it a sort of amusing past time- making backups would have been an afterthought. Most people probably wouldn't have bothered reporting small losses. So all you have are these larger reported losses. Assuming 0 lost coins is implausible, considering the assumptions required. So is every coin that hasn't moved in 3 years. Where you draw the line is personal, but a million or so coins isn't really unbelievable.

Every bit of technical analysis is the same- make statements about how the numbers have been, claim their are floors and ceilings and other sort of "patterns" within the noise, and these patterns somehow predict a trend in the data in a way other than randomness and news would suggest. Then make vague predictions that can't be easily disproven- use statements like "probably" or "trending" or simultaneously predict it could go up or down. Also be vague about the time period, so the up or down which you supposedly called can be identified as having occurred anywhere from days to months later.

You're suggesting that very wealthy people somehow aren't as informed about investment opportunities as average joes. That's very silly. Not only are very wealthy people more likely to stay informed on technology, if anything, very wealthy people are *better* poised to take advantage of Bitcoin as an asset at any point because of disposable and investable cash. A very wealthy person could drop ten times whatever you're worth in Bitcoin tomorrow without issue. Maybe they don't gain as much, but whatever, they'll be richer than you.
Sure, several thousand geeks will get rich. A few dozen with very large holdings (the Winklevoss twins, for instance) might become billionaires or decabillionaires. But that's not going to upend the status quo. And it's not much different than the type of mobility you see when a big startup company goes public.

What are the concerns of this AD threshold other than the fact that an improbably longer chain could be accepted? This seems like the case with ordinary orphaned blocks.
As far as the median EB attack, help me understand. What does the malicious miner gain by splitting the hashrate and causing a temporary disruption, at a risk of losing their reward? Producing such a malicious block would require a sufficient volume of transactions in existence in the first place to exceed this median EB value.  In a properly functioning BU implementation I would envision such an enormous backlog of transactions sufficient to breach the median EB value would be exceedingly rare. 
It seems this threat of an EB attack would simply encourage miners to raise their EB values. And that's a good thing! We want miners to be pushing through as many transactions as they can, and have a strong incentive to upgrade capacity. A higher EB allows for miners to more comfortably sweep up transaction backlogs. And the larger the blocks from the sweeping up of benevolent miners, the less often an EB attack could succeed, as the transaction volume shouldn't exist, correct? A malicious actor could produce umpteen spam transactions, but this then becomes a very costly endeavor for a rather short-lived disruption.

I don't think that's impossible at all. I expect a few more Chinese pools will commit to BU. With that and Antpool coming fully aboard that should give BU a majority of the hashrate. As the block size cripples the network it'll appear that a switch to BU would require the least inertia to achieve change. You may then see some defections or a shifting of hashpower from current Segwit support, from Slush. That'd be enough to have a comfortable 75%. As it becomes clear BU will hard fork, you'll have a domino effect, with all but perhaps a sliver of miners switching over.

Now, you're correct that Bitcoin alone probably cannot reasonably scale to a massive global level at present bandwidth limitations. But a blocksize increase absolutely delays the profitability point for Blockstream. If fees aren't oppressively high, there's minimal interest in off-chain transactions. An increase of 4 to 8 times in peak bandwidth will serve to prevent and practically eliminate any transaction backlog in the near term. That's good news for Bitcoin- bad news for Blockstream.


Terrible analogy! Sad! Two or three more buckets? How about 4 or 8 times the pumping capacity when the previous capacity was adequate a little over a year ago?


Follow the money.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:05:05


Ah, you are correct. You would be the only miner interested in these fee free transactions. I'm still unclear as to the degree of disruption this would actually create, as the costs still involve risking loss of a block reward.


I don't think I have a great explanation here, but I'll try. It's useful for miners to signal their intentions and expectations. Miners are not, nor should they be, accepting blocks of literally any size. Even with no hard coded limit simply tremendous blocks (say 5 TB) would wreck havoc. It's up to the individual miners to determine what blocks they want to accept and produce. This signaling allows miners to set optimal block sizes they estimate are capable of fast propagation while still being accepted by peers.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:57:37
Exactly. We'll be right back at square one in maybe a year or two. BU would allow for more dynamic scaling as the network allows. I think BU+ Segwit would be an acceptable HF.

Cartels are inherently unstable as there's a persistent incentive to defect. Attempts to fix fees will inevitably result in defection. The higher prices are fixed, the greater the incentive to defect. With a larger blocksize it becomes even easier for a lone defector to sweep up and collect the transactions en masse.

To be honest, as a merchant accepting credit cards I may get confirmation a transaction have been approved within 4-5 minutes, but the actual settlement won't take place for another 12-24+ hours. I wouldn't expect to see the funds in my bank account for at least 3 days.
Generally a delay like this isn't relevant because we deliberately delay submitting our orders to our warehouse until the next business day unless people specify rush shipping. This is because many, many people end up wanting to change their address after the fact. And the warehouse really only can guarantee same day shipment for orders placed before 10 AM anyways, so it's not like submitting them immediately would actually speed anything up.
@_date: 2016-01-01 05:10:21
I think that's not unreasonable. There's a thread on bitcointalk that discusses some large, known losses, totalling into the 6 figures. Considering that's only going to be a fraction of the total, I don't think a million+ is at all impossible. You could look at the number of coins that haven't been moved in the last X years (I think it's like 6 million), but this is more of an outer-limit estimate. Plenty of Hodlers haven't moved any coins but have total control over them.

I'm in agreement that the majority of value of most things is an emergent property- things are valuable because enough other people will give you things in exchange for them- there's a market. Gold really isn't as valuable as it is because it doesn't corrode or it's malleable or is useful in electronics, as most people have no use for such properties. 
However, gold does have these intrinsic properties that gives it value to *some* people independent of any sort of network of exchange. Some people can find a utility  in gold that's substantial even if there's no one around to accept gold as a medium of exchange. They can mold it, plate things, fill a tooth, whatever with it. That's value from the thing not being money. I think that's the intrinsic value goldbugs talk about. That's different from bitcoin and a dollar bill (beyond being a piece of paper).
Does it really matter though? I think not. I'd wager the overwhelming majority of gold owners have no interest in doing anything with gold other than using it as a store of value.

Orphan blocks was the previous explanation by core as to why big blocks wouldn't work- miners would risk losing rewards making blocks too large, hence it wasn't something miners should want to consider. Now the allegation is that miners will somehow *want* to produce enormous blocks.
What's the increase in time for initial blockchain synchronization that would actually create a meaningful deterrence in setting up a node in the first place? As we're beyond the 24 hour mark for sync you're already at a "set-it-and-forget-it" mode.

1. Arguably any orphaned chain creates 42 million bitcoins, temporarily. That doesn't disrupt confidence. It's not as though such a fork will occur unpredictably or without warning. As the chain is nearly certain to die I'd expect you'd realistically see a very rapid shift of hashpower to beyond 75% when the 75% threshold is reached. It's not going to be some fork in which 25% of the hashpower remains isolated there indefinitely.
2. Ultimately these block size increases do become enforced through Nakamoto consensus when they're actually mined and accepted, correct? Or am I missing something?
3. That's a different, but I suppose valid criticism of BU developer conduct. However, the code is open source, so it's easy enough to voice that criticism. It's not the case that the code has been hidden and therefore we can't know what code we're actually agreeing to run. The BU developers might behave poorly, but that doesn't change the merits of the underlying code.

We're talking about the collective actions of miners, not any particular one. Plenty of users are of a diverse opinion when it comes to block sizes, as are miners. There are a not unsubstantial number of users here who believe blocks should be less than 1 MB. No one should be mandated to mine blocks of any particular size- and that's exactly what will happen under BU. However, miners own rational self-interests in maximizing total collected fees will naturally lead to an increased block size where the risk of orphanage is not too significant to offset increased fees. Some miners will maintain particular idiosyncrasies and mine blocks that are smaller than maximum. And that's fine. It only becomes an issue because we've placed a hard cap on the upper limit here so that nearly all of of miners *are* mining at 1 MB. 
In an uncapped market, other miners would be able to pick up the slack of smaller miners and mine larger blocks- taking with them extra fees that have accumulated from these smaller blocks. Unfortunately, that's not happened, due to the artificial restrictions that were soft-forked in.

Under that theory, yes. But I'm not sure current participants have the available capital to effectively price in the anticipated demand of new participants yet to come to the market.

But really though. A blockchain for private companies doesn't make much sense in most applications. You want something only a select group of people can write to? And you want people to be able to reverse and change transactions? And you don't want absolutely everyone to be able to examine these transactions publicly? Sounds like you're talking about a redundant database, not a blockchain.

I mean he's right. Bitcoin isn't going to create some special new world order. People with wealth will buy bitcoin. Investment banks will buy Bitcoin instead of gold or whatever. The people making the most from bitcoin will be the holders from the beginning and wealthy people capable of really buying a serious share right now. Everyone else can get a solid return on their investment if Bitcoin's successful, but it's not going to topple established wealth.

Uh absolutely not true. This is a totally new asset category for the SEC. I'd say it's at least as complicated and as much of a breakthrough as the first Gold ETF, probably much more so. And approval so far hasn't taken as long as the Gold ETF, why should we be concerned?

@_date: 2016-01-14 19:40:29


Actually no. I'm able to run joinmarket and earn about 1% a year in interest from mixing transactions because I have a full node. That more than pays for my time and the electricity/bandwidth to run and maintain it.
I suppose in theory I could have a selfish node that has no outgoing connections if I wanted to cut down on bandwidth and still get the benefits of joinmarket. But since I don't have a bandwidth cap and my router does a good job of prioritizing traffic, the marginal cost is basically 0.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:19:38

We should allow miners to be determining rules, as Satoshi intended, using hashpower as proof of stake.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:08:06
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:10:25
The miners have always been in control of determining whatever rules are used to accept and validate blocks and that decision has always fallen based on hashpower, as it's the fairest proof of stake Satoshi could envision. Rolling back the temporary softfork limit and allowing the market to dictate the blocksize will make blocks remain at an equilibrium that increases transactions per block while remaining technically feasible. Expecting a bunch of eggheads to know the "best" block size better than the markets is foolhardy, especially when those eggheads have their pockets being padded by major VC firms.

This. No one had their finger on a trigger to buy BTC in the event of a Brexit the way people did to buy USD or gold. It might take a week or more for someone shocked with the Brexit to open an account, verify their identity, link a bank account, verify the bank account, transfer funds in and make a trade.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:18:29
Lol. "Feels" get in the way of actual numbers and math. For one, it's not a "bubble" so far, it's been a sharp increase and a correction. Bubbles pop, they don't deflate.
Second, who knows what's going to happen. We have the halvening approaching, a possible wave of new investors opening accounts and making SEPA transfers after the surprise Brexit vote that'll come in maybe midweek. The whole Brexit has destabilized global financial markets and currencies- there's talk that China may decide to intervene further and devalue the yuan. Politically, we may see a number of referendums for EU exits that'll further devalue the currency, markets and lead to greater disarray.
Bitcoin might go up and it might go down, who knows.

Yup. Because Bitcoin is covered for novelty right now by the mainstream media. If the Euro does *anything* it's reported as often in the news as is partly-overcast but warm weather- it's noteworthy simply because it's there.
Bitcoin's got to do a bit more to get noticed. The ETF and its movements are going to be much more closely followed by finance media just because they're comfortable with those things.

I don't think FATCA applies here, necessarily, but as an example of the US's foreign compliance powers, if a country won't make its banks play ball with the US for disclosing financial account holders, then the US prohibits  ALL US-banks from exchanging ANY funds with the defiant country. Which is so absolutely devastating to basically every country that it has to comply.
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:33:00
It's very realistic considering the capital controls in place and desire for most wealthy families to hide their assets outside the grasp of the government. Also, Venezuela and Argentina are trivial for bitcoin- they have so little wealth to invest even a small move by a tiny portion of Chinese investors will easily exceed anything they can do. Also pretty tough for Venezuelans to buy when their currency is worthless, they're using everything they have to stay fed, and you have blackouts four days a week.

Remember the true market cap is actually smaller than $9 billion because of millions of lost coins. Bitcoin's a baby and has much more room to grow than even a relatively small "$9 billion" cap would suggest.
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:48:35
Right. And people may still elect to just keep things running hoping that the BTC/USD rate catches up even if they're at a loss. Or that difficulty drops.
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:36:24
Let's be honest here, it's a surprising volatility for one of the world's largest. As Bitcoin gets larger we'll see less and less volatility as well.
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:31:14
You're basing this on the previous ramp up occurring after the last halving? Not unreasonable.
@_date: 2016-06-04 15:05:01
Loads of early bitcoins weren't bought at all, but that's irrelevant to market cap. Market cap is just the total number of coins times current price. If a million coins aren't accessible and are effectively destroyed then there are fewer coins and thus a lower market cap than if they hadn't.
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:24:51
K, just provide a few predictions that are disprovable and we'll see.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:04:06
Yes, and by that he means a *true* market cap high- one that takes into account only bitcoins that haven't been lost or destroyed. It's just an estimate, but I think it's a fair take.
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:20:32
No no, it'll be calling people out as delusional, *then* calling it dead when it drops a bit.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:51:30
Not a bad guess, we'll see how it plays out. High volatility no matter what methinks.
@_date: 2016-06-03 20:32:44
Depends on how you define" circulation". There aren't 15.6 million in existence in a way they can be used, loads have been lost and destroyed. Loads too are in cold storage. They might still exist and be accessible, but they aren't circulating. So amongst coins actually being regularly circulated, it's completely plausible that that is just 500k or so.

Trying to attribute any price movement in Bitcoin to a world event is tricksy business when Bitcoin moves much larger amounts for no apparent reason. I'd imagine a few Brits will buy Bitcoin as a result of this article, but I think it'll have a minimal effect on Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2016-06-25 21:59:27
If anything, I think the media and press coverage Bitcoin is getting as being a safe-haven asset will increase investor awareness and eventually make it a recognized safe-haven asset as investors reevaluate options. But I expect that to occur over a more gradual timespan of months to years as investors encounter long-term global financial instability. Very few people had their finger on a trigger to buy BTC the way traders  were ready to shift GBP to USD or gold. 
Until Bitcoin has an ETF or Forex presence I don't expect markets to react on a similar timescale.
Edit: I typoed GBP.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:48:16
Looks like some technical issue from Bitfinex forced them to pause trading. If I had funds available I'd actually buy.
@_date: 2016-06-03 20:28:09
That's a bit of a strawman. About 10% could be anything that's about 10%. It's probably not exactly 10%.
@_date: 2016-06-05 00:15:26
If you're comparing it to the market cap of gold, silver, a particular currency, etc.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:50:28
With major currencies it doesn't take enormous shifts to have huge global effects. It's not really a distorted axes when it shows you the range in the last several years. You wouldn't show an axis starting at zero for the movement of any currency against another, unless the actual value came close to trending into that range.
EDIT: And we're talking about over an 8% devaluation since the middle of 2015 or so. That's really, really substantial.

If it's remain I think the shift in GBP is so small that it's not worth making a bet over.
If it's leave, you not only see a GBP devaluation (and Euro??), you'll see a flight to Bitcoin. As Bitcoin is so small, you only need a tiny influx of capital from Brexit flight to see bitcoin appreciate. That's how Bitcoin appreciates- it's not that the British pound is down a few percent, it's that a tiny portion of investors panic and seek bitcoin, driving it up a ton.
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:51:33
Or, establish a self-directed IRA. The IRA gets an LLC in its name. The LLC gets a checking account, which can be linked to Coinbase/wherever to buy bitcoin. Store the IRA bitcoin in a wallet separate from your own.
@_date: 2016-06-05 00:12:33
You can't know for certain how many, on the other hand, you can be fairly confident at least 100,000 and probably more have been lost in reported data crashes and corruption. The big takeaway is that the true market cap is far less than $9 billion, so you should expect Bitcoin to have *greater* growth potential than the raw market cap calculation suggests.
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:18:53
To be fair, Bitcoin can be "invested" and produce yields. Joinmarket allows for a 1%+ annual return.
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:29:55


Not at all true. As fewer bitcoin are created the price increases. $100 still buys bitcoin on the markets just as easily, it's just that with a higher price you acquire fewer bitcoins. Which is irrelevant to the utility.
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:59:20
Good, now we just need the ETF...
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:32:25

@_date: 2016-06-06 17:02:12
And there may be a bit of a sell-off after the halvening *because* so many people have bought in expecting enormous payouts. Or it'll go to the moon. No one knows. What fun!
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:47:47
The current price does reflects available supply. The market cap does not and is inflated.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:39:49
To be fair, you don't reduce the supply by halving the block reward. You reduce the rate of increase in the total supply.

Because those countries are small, poor and have shitty currencies. China has over 100 times the people as Zimbabwe and an economy 1800 times larger. Even if every Zimbabwean were to abandon all currency for Bitcoin it'd have less of an effect on volume than a tiny 1 percentage point uptick in Chinese adoption.

It's really not correlated with stocks or gold. You can cherry pick time-scales, but the magnitude and direction bitcoin moves compared to these assets is basically random.

But this has been the case for a long time. How does this explain the increase now?
@_date: 2016-06-26 23:49:28
Yeah the 1% are important but the 1% of the US are definitely the kind to use an exchange. You're talking about someone making around $400k or so a year- after paying taxes, housing costs and other living costs your disposable income for investments are not *that* much that you'd be breaking exchanges with your Bitcoin purchases.
The 1% definitely are using bitcoin exchanges. The 0.001% are not.

It took years upon years for the first Gold ETF to get approved, COIN hasn't been pending for close to that long, and gold was a far more commonly traded and understood asset at the time than Bitcoin is now. So I wouldn't be surprised if it takes longer just going through the normal motions.

It should be about the same cost as today actually. And there's little reason to believe the cost of mining $100k in Bitcoin should cost much more energy than extracting $100k in resources elsewhere, whether it's harvesting timber, mining gold, drilling oil, etc.

:-/. That's not a "small miner", that's a Flintstones miner.


So on a ridiculously crippled connection we start to have issues at 100MiB blocks? 


What percentage of the hashpower mines at 50KiB/second and would therefore be pushed offline at 100MiB blocks? 1%? .1%? If so, there's extraordinarily limited incentive for any miner to artificially raise the blocksize with fake transactions, as the added cost of HDD space and risk of an orphan block at that point probably exceeds the miner's anticipated theoretical increase in yield from removing a teeny tiny portion of the hashrate. The risk of umbrage in artificially creating a block so large would likely depress the Bitcoin price enough to deter such behavior in the first place.

But "it went up" and "X occurred" doesn't really mean the two are linked. Gains since the Brexit have been modest, and  gradual, as far as Bitcoin goes. There wasn't any enormous spike as the first polling results came in. There's no enormous velocity like we had in the push to 750+. This movement is not outside the realm of typical fluctuation for Bitcoin absent news.
Compare that to the pound abruptly dropping something like 16 standard deviations beyond average variation as Brexit news came in.

I think you have a very poor idea as to who the 1% are. Elites already hold a disproportionately high quantity of bitcoins. Sure, it's only a portion of those in the 1%, but so is it all places. The 1% are far more likely than the 99% to have some awareness of bitcoin.

"The only way to make loads of money from offchain transactions in the near future is by further crippling the blocksize to the point that offchain transactions are really the only practical way to use Bitcoin. By reducing the blocksize, we create perpetual transaction congestion for ordinary transactions, rapidly accelerating the point at which offchain transactions become profitable and demanded. As scaling solutions, such as Segwit, would actually serve to increase the number of transactions per block, relieve transaction congrestion and delay offchain transaction demand and profitability, a blocksize reduction to 300k would readjust demand and accelerate offchain profitability."

The total hashrate is growing increasingly larger. Owning an appreciable percentage is growing increasingly more and more expensive. The whole point of joining a pool is to smooth out reward spikes and receive more consistent returns. Creating a pool then with only a tiny fraction of a percentage of hashrate is going to be increasingly unappealing and difficult. Small time miners would be far more likely to go with some existing pool as total hashrate (and cost of producing that hashrate) increases.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:35:14


I'd have to understand the function a little better, but even though nodes play no formal decision-making role, they do serve as a proxy for miners to understand what size blocks will be propagated generally, and help to inform miners. Broadcasting the max accept depth then acts as a bellwether or what the network feels ready for. This in turn should affect what *other miners* are ready for. It's a mere signaling function.
In Bitcoin, ultimately *everyone* can do whatever they want, whenever. Their conduct, however, is incentivized by the capacity of individual participants to freely decide the legitimacy of those actions for themselves.


Yes. Even drastic and detrimental changes to the Bitcoin protocol, if propagated into the longest valid PoW chain, would represent Nakamoto consensus of the present blockchain ledger of Bitcoin. Now there's plenty of reason why it *wouldn't* happen- the very spectre of altering one of the fundamental appeals of Bitcoin would send the markets tumbling and disincentive miners from adhering to such a protocol in the first place. But ultimately what the longest valid PoW chain is dictates the quantity and location of Bitcoins at any given moment.
Otherwise, hypothetically if the majority of hashpower and *every* node in existence and every participant decided the block reward would be 25BTC, and the old chain continued only from here, would that work? Now personally, I think *I* might say and decide that isn't Bitcoin and Bitcoin is therefore dead. But if everyone else says it's Bitcoin, then it is- a least something, even if we deny bitcoin continues to exist.
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:39:44

The longest chain always *dictates* the current blockchain. Clients can choose to follow the longest chain or not, but if they continue to ignore it they no longer are compatible with the current blockchain.

1. Hardly anyone outside of Venezuela would accept Bolivars for Bitcoin. Unless I'm going on a vacation, and why the hell would I sell Bitcoin for Bolivars when the country is in disarray?
2. Venezuelans are poor as shit, especially right now. Inflation is the cause of people's woes, but for most people it's not going to be the erosion of wealth, it's going to be the erosion of wages and increase in prices. If I'm already living from paycheck to paycheck, there's little to no free money I have to place into Bitcoin in the first place. And it doesn't fix the problem that my weekly wages are fixed and losing purchasing power every week.
3. Capital controls probably already prevent significant electronic transfers of money outside the country and generally. Tough to even get money into an exchange. Even just getting money out of an ATM to buy Bitcoin in person is a challenge
4. Rolling blackouts and inconsistent electrical availability limit people's ability to reliably use bitcoin as a point of sale. If the power and internet/cell phone networks are constantly going down, it makes it really hard for me to pay with things and for others to know they've been paid.
5. Probably a general lack of awareness and recognition of Bitcoin as money from a less technically savvy populous. Also being more concerned with finding your next meal than much else.

Yes. That's actually *all* of bitcoin. The longest valid chain with the greatest PoW dictates what is and isn't bitcoin- miners *do* have total direct control over what protocols are accepted. Nodes do not have any formal representation as to what the blockchain is or isn't.


The point at which blocks become so large that my little netbook node can't even keep up with the most recent block over a 10 minute period would be so large that miners wouldn't be able to propagate them without an unacceptable delay of a few seconds and risk losing their own reward. In short, it's a situation that would never be in a miner's interest to allow happen.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:58:04
You are correct, nodes do not have any formal representation as to what the blockchain is or isn't. They're welcome to say things that miners may choose or not choose to incorporate in their decision-making, just as much as anyone can say anything. Miners will probably also look to movements in the markets, speeches given by prominent individuals and other factors in their decision-making- this is all signaling. None of those things have any formal weight in what the network becomes though. 
Of course Satoshi imagined participants in Bitcoin would talk to one another and suggest what they may or may not want done prior to doing it! It's a decentralized network, not an isolationist one!

Is the block that says you have that coin on the longest chain with the greatest PoW?
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:36:24
I don't think you understand. Nakamoto consensus dictates what Bitcoin is- it transcends any particular client. Whether or not a client's rules are implemented depends on whether or not they're in the majority of hashpower. That's it. If BU starts mining and it's in the minority and not on the longest chain, then it's rules aren't implemented according to Nakamoto consensus. If it's in the majority, then its rules aren't implemented as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:15:07
So in that case the chain that didn't hard fork became the altcoin, right?
I think the identity of what makes a cryptocurrency a cryptocurrency may transcend any notion of Nakamoto consensus or adherence to any particular rule. It is a *consensus reality*- if enough people say something is or isn't Bitcoin, then that's Bitcoin. You or I can say what criteria other people *ought* to look to at, or we may say we wouldn't call something Bitcoin if it adhered to certain rules, but ultimately what people at large decide is Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Nodes add redundancy and robustness in storing and propagating the blockchain, as well as transactions. Miners are already also nodes.


To present their owners with the present status of the ledger in a trustless format. Validating the entire history ensures that there is no trust needed to be placed on any other party.


No, at least not in any sort of proportional, representational manner. It may be a proxy to show generally what the economy may support, but it's only a proxy. If I launched a billion nodes that only validated blocks adhering to some absurd proposition, that would have no bearing on what was or wasn't actually processed by the network. There merely needs to be a *sufficient* absolute number of nodes adhering to a protocol to ensure the longest PoW chain is propagated and accessible- the proportion is irrelevant in and of itself.

To be completely fair, ZH is claiming it has sources at Bloomberg who have passed along this information. When journalists say they have sources at XYZ reporting something, they don't literally mean that XYZ has published an article on the topic. 
The fact that Bloomberg has no published article on the topic is not at all dispositive of the notion that these sources do know what they know. If Bloomberg *had* published an article, ZH would have just directly linked to the article.
Now, obviously, this information still relies in our confidence of these unnamed sources to be accurate. ZH is not the paragon of journalistic integrity, however I have yet to see them outright fabricate a source.
You should take the information with a grain of salt, as we're relying on the strength of unnamed sources, but all information present does not suggest outright fabrication by ZeroHedge.

Yes, we are supposed to discount the study, at least somewhat, since it's drawing conclusions using a method that isn't representative of the group for conclusions being drawn. Perhaps "92% of millenials who are willing to complete Facebook surveys" don't trust financial institutions, but there's a substantial portion of millennials not on Facebook, or not on Facebook regularly enough to complete surveys, and it's not unreasonable to imagine these individuals would hold different attitudes than those who do use Facebook and complete the surveys.


That's irrelevant if the data aren't representative. I could poll 50,000 people at a baseball game about their favorite sport, but that almost certainly wouldn't be a more accurate idea of American's favorite sport than a random sample of 1,000 Americans.

I mean, it's a total ballpark estimate. The average Venezuelan *as of  early 2015* had wages of [$20 a month]( A school teacher of 25 years experience made $35 a month.

I actually think you're wrong here. The Economist has probably one of the highest networth, financially savvy readership of any major publication. Big investors are the easiest way of fueling Bitcoin's growth and commissions for Kraken. 
An ad like this makes Bitcoin feel very accessible and secure for investors who are comfortable using online brokerage accounts but not much else.

No no. I re-read the white paper. Miners express their acceptance of validity by lengthening that chain. The fact that a chain is lengthened is evidence of it being accepted as valid.

I mean that in a decentralized system people will look to others for advice. That's one way how people make decisions- gathering information.
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:47:47
Because that's how clients advocate for particular rules. They "vote" for particular rules when they mine blocks, and if those blocks end up on the longest chain, that's bitcoin. If they vote for things that don't make it onto the longest chain, it's not.
@_date: 2016-11-01 20:29:18
I think we're in a general agreement here and are just disagreeing about semantics as to what it means to "get to decide" something. When I say the longest valid PoW chain, I don't mean valid in the sense of others accepting it, I mean valid in the sense of "valid Proof-of-Work" PoW that hasn't been fabricated. 
There are definite and real incentives that influence what protocols miners follow. But that doesn't deprive them of the capacity to actually mine whatever blocks they want. And the continued extension and lengthening of the block-chain after their block ensures its continued acceptance and determined validity. The economy and opinions of other participants incentivize whatever protocols fall in line, but it's ultimately the miners, who choose what chain to lengthen, that determines the current state of the blockchain is.
Can you objectively enunciate what is the present Bitcoin protocols are being followed, where individual bitcoins are and how many bitcoins are in existence otherwise?

That wouldn't solve anything. People are already trading their Bolivars for more stable assets like dollars and gold. Dollars is going to work much better in a destabilized society with constant rolling blackouts and a less tech-savvy populace. Anonymity is also better preserved, and people already are very familiar with dollars.
And in any event, it doesn't solve the fundamental problem facing the poor- not the erosion of wealth (they don't have it), but rather the declining purchasing power of their wages paid in Bolivars and the shortages from government mismanagement. The government doesn't have sound money, and it also employs large numbers of people. Lots of people using something other than Bolivars will not fix this fundamental problem.

@_date: 2016-11-01 20:11:51


Absolutely. Mining cartels are looking to maximize their profilts, and that requires the price of Bitcoin remains high. If an action to increase a cartel's yield in bitcoins decreases their real profits from a falling price, they won't do it. Perhaps if not perfectly aligned, their incentives are aligned enough so that actions that result in a radical decrease in what Bitcoin holders value bitcoin at will not occur.




I'm unclear what makes you think BU does not believe this.


This contradicts what you said, where biggest hashpower decides Bitcoin.
Not at all. My point was to illustrate than a particular individual deciding something doesn't exist doesn't make it not exist. And philosophically, even if you want to deny that something no longer is Bitcoin, it's still a transaction network everyone else calls Bitcoin, which still carries with it a weight of ramifications.

Venezuela has actually resisted printing larger notes for a long time, thinking that larger denomination bills (and not the total amount of money) would further spur hyperinflation.

I think when the blocksize is so consistently large that it taxes broadband connections you'll see a drop off. Right now an entry-level broadband connection in the US is considered around 25 Mbps or ~3.125 MB/s. A block is produced ~10 minutes or 600 seconds. I'll say that using 100% of a connection more than 1% of a connection just to keep a node up to date is probably taxing. So for an entry-level broadband connection you'd start to see that at around consistent 18.75 MB blocks.
Now there are other constraints. At some point larger blocks will require substantially more processing power, though Segwit could change that. But so long as traffic and optimization keeps pace that someone can hook up a $200-$300 netbook or laptop without really affecting their other activities I don't see it decreasing node counts.
There is a fear, possibly rightly held, that at some point node requirements could grow so burdensome someone would practically need to have access to a data-center to verify their own transactions. But we need to avoid a slippery slope argument here- yes, introducing 10 GB blocks tomorrow is bad and would have bad consequences. That doesn't mean that an increase in traffic now, through Segwit or however is going to have bad consequences.


Wait wait, you're *doubling* maximum transaction capacity. That's not negligible! It's extraordinarily significant! It may be that blocks do fill up again, but that's growth and increased use of Bitcoin- that's a good thing! What do you think is happening to all the transactions *not* being sent now because of high fees?

I'm not saying *all things* are consensus realities! Certain categories, like nearly all people, are objectively one person or not. Other items, like concepts, religions or ideologies are less objectively defined and are thus more defined by a consensus reality- what (or who) defines what is feminism? Or what is or what is a belief of Christianity? There's no single, unambiguous source you can point to that will tell you all of the beliefs of a Christian in a way everyone agrees on. Certain beliefs will be more or less universally agreed on as Christian, and others may be recognized as a commonly held belief, but not universally agreed on, others will be less commonly held but still recognized as something some Christians believe and even others will be recognized as completely contrary. 
Yet despite that uncertainty, we're still able to cobble together some notion such that when we say "Christian" we have some concept of what that means. The same is probably true of Bitcoin. Nakamoto consensus is one way to define what Bitcoin is, which I advocate. The never-hardforked chain may be another. Ultimately, what the consensus of people decide (and this is a very nebulous phenomenon) will define what someone is taken to mean when they say Bitcoin.

I've never quite accepted the "already priced in" theory to investments like Bitcoin that aren't as universally accessible or understood by people with a lot of capital.

Perhaps I'm mincing words, but the work is actually as it's been represented. It's not forged, the signatures are valid. I can't just make a fake block that claims I solved a block with a near infinite difficulty- the solution/hash must be valid.

You're assuming the marginal increase in supposed bandwidth costs are actually substantial enough to decrease the number of nodes. It's not. You could double the blockchain size today without substantially impacting the number of nodes. Especially when you consider that you can run a pruned node.

Another interesting thing is that the growth this time, from the Mt. Gox restabilization and on, has been much more stable. Daily volatility has generally been lower. The price may rise or fall, but there aren't extraordinary ups and downs within the same day.

Clients definitely vote based on hash power. If that gets into the longest blockchain, it wins. If it doesn't it loses.
Any miner can choose any client or make their own. But like a representational body, if their rules aren't accepted by the majority of others, they'll lose out on their rewards.

One- they aren't hired labor- no one hires them. Two, the creation of coins is economic activity broadcast from the nodes of the miner's, so they are economic nodes. Or how do you define an economic node?

No. The number of nodes present have no formal de jure bearing on the state of bitcoin. If a split occurs, nodes in a small minority will have a strong incentive to switch.

I don't think you're using the word "hire" appropriately here.

It depends on the nature of the hard fork. Ethereum's hard fork effectively tampered with the immutability of the blockchain. 
In reality the smaller chain will die off rather quickly for Bitcoin- with enough support for the main chain transactions will grind to a halt on the shorter chain. Highly recommended John Blocke's essay on this.

De facto control is not dejure control. People can take their hashpower elsewhere.

"Manipulation", "fake narrative"- did commodities prices drop in the last month or not? I don't think it in and of itself suggests commodities  or China's housing bubble have "popped", but that's a heck of a different claim than suggesting the data are fake!
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:15:56
Ok, fair, in the scope of *moving to a capacity to accomodate major global currency*, 1 MB to 2 MB is negligible. And if we were to jump to (and fill, constantly) a blocksize that would accommodate a global currency tomorrow, we'd see serious impacts on decentralization. But those are two separate arguments, right? 
The concern at present is that Bitcoin is so stopped up it could rapidly become unusable. And if Bitcoin becomes unusable, the currency could become so crippled it stifles growth and the incentives for innovation. And in that sense, Blocksize increases are like a pressure release valve that buys you time for these new solutions. As 2 MB or 4 MB+ aren't going to impact decentralization, it's worth considering now.
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:47:56


I think you mean caused by Bitcoin. That's a sin no different from the rest of economic news. Every day writers will attribute fluctuations in the market to random political events. We've been on an alleged "Trump-election enthusiasm" binge for the past few weeks. The market will go up and down and writers may point to "Euro jitters" as the cause- even if it's back up the next day without any change in the situation in Europe! This may not be warranted, but so then is the pricing attributions by almost everyone in finance.


Are you claiming the author has invented this data? These commodities have dipped double digits in the last month or so- the author hasn't fabricated that. Now, it's fair to argue that in the context of a larger timeframe, pricing trends may not be entirely supportive of the claims the author is arguing. But that's a lot different than *falsifying data*! If I claim the commodities market has plunged, and I point to the last month, your telling me it's still mostly up for the year doesn't really disprove my claims of a sudden plunge- and it certainly doesn't say my claims are fake news!
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:21:22

The sites don't publish their methods, but my guess is bitcoinblockhalf is more accurate with its earlier date.
You cannot calculate the halvening date with great accuracy just by taking the remaining number of blocks and multiplying by 10 minutes because blocks have been  consistently solved faster than 10 minutes on average. Even though difficulty adjusts to keep block solve times in the 10 minute range, the network hashrate has been growing much faster than the difficulty can keep up with. It's not unreasonable to assume this trend will continue.
My guess then is that Bitcoinblockhalf accounts for this and Bitcoin clock does not. All of these are just estimates, not exact countdowns, and will be adjusting constantly based on the rate of block solves. We won't know which one is actually more accurate until the halvening actually happens, but barring a big slowdown in hashrates, I'd guess blockhalf is probably going to be closer to the actual date.

A strict adherence to rational investor theory would hold that the halving has already been priced in by existing market participants.
 But who knows. People are emotional idiots. I think you'll see a slight spike right before and some volatility after. The biggest effect will be later down the line- when Europe or China is dealing with debt, capital controls, negative interest rates, a shaky currency and look to Bitcoin as a real safety spot, you'll see a big liquity crunch driving the price higher. But that's just my dumb luck guess.

I believe most miners, at least as a percent of network hashpower, are not running equipment on such minimal margins that their systems are only just covering electricity costs, to the point they'd shutdown after a halving. If they were, we'd see dropoffs in hashrate from these recent difficulty increases. 
The difficulty has more than doubled since December- any machine's yield then has halved from December to now. That's effectively the same reduction in yield we'd see from a halving. Has there been a mass shutdown of these now unprofitable units since then? An open question, but I'd say no. You have some old clunkers that have finally, finally bit the dust, but it's otherwise hunky-doory on the prospect of yield exceeding electricity costs. Certainly not enough to disrupt the hashrate.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:02:36

@_date: 2016-02-29 15:25:00
If you've invested a lot in mining hardware, would you turn off your mining equipment as soon as the halving occurs? Probably not, right? You've already been weathering ~10-20% increases in difficulty every two weeks just fine- cumulatively these have already hurt your yields far more than the halving will.
Most miners will probably take a wait and see approach with existing hardware, looking at changes in difficulty and price to determine the best course of action. If they decide, it won't be simultaneously.
I think we'll see a reduction in the rate of hashpower increase as we approach and experience the halving as people take a wait and see approach to investment. If there's a drop in hashpower, it won't be immediate and instead occur across a 1-4 week period. It may be so small it's offset by newcomers.

He certainly has the right to disconnect and unplug the miners. He/his company also has the right to seek a judgement against whoever planted them for damages at least amounting to the stolen electricity. 
He may even have the right to bitcoins mined on your property with stolen electricity, though the hassle in litigating this may make it more trouble than it's worth. His company could probably also lock the mining unit away and hold onto it until the electricity dispute gets settled- it'd give them leverage.

For one, having the majority of hashpower in China may mean hashpower is centered there, but it doesn't mean it's centralized. Centralization, at least to me, implies some sort of formal consolidation of power under a specific entity. It's not the Chinese government that controls this, it's a bunch of randos who happen to be in China. It's slightly concerning, but my experience is that the Chinese people have a much different set of priorities than the government. I generally believe Bitcoin miners will act in a rational self interest to maximize the price of Bitcoin and their yields.
Also, where else would you expect hashpower to be concentrated? You'd naturally expect more mining in areas that have lots of educated people with stable, cheap power, adequate connection speeds, no ongoing conflict and not ridiculous temperatures. China's got a billion of those people. It's such a natural distribution I'd be hard pressed to say what the better distribution could look like organically.

Correct. That is a change of ledger. That's fine because Alice initiated the transaction under the rules in place at the time. That's how normal transactions work. That doesn't disrupt the immutability of the ledger. We aren't concerned about individual transfers that take place *with the consent and initiation of the party that possesses the private keys to control the funds*. We're concerned about system-wide changes that transfer money *absent the consent of the party possessing the funds*- that disrupts the immutability of the ledger.  The immutability of the ledger grants every individual confidence that the location of funds as written in the ledger can only be changed under rules known to the individual: namely, through the initiation of transactions signed with the corresponding private key.




Wait, so is it a rule change or a state update? Make up your mind! If it's a retroactive rule change, my point stands, it's a change of ledger that disrupts the immutability of the ledger. If it's a state-update- that is, it changes who owns what, that's a change of ledger that disrupts the immutability of the ledger.
Before you drown in your own double-speak, try to define the immutability of the ledger first, then explain how the fork didn't disrupt that.

It's definitely a possibility, but the question is *how* could they interfere? They could easily institute raids and shutdown miners or block bitcoin traffic and that would be chaotic for a few days (if the shutdowns all happened at oncee), but the network would ultimately adapt, the hashrate would drop and miners in other areas of the world would be incentivized to boot up more hardware.
The other scarier idea is that the Chinese government could set up some sort of censorship so that all Chinese nodes would have to exclude transactions in their blocks from a set of addresses provided to them and updated daily. It's possible, but it would require a lot of effort and attention from the government. Even then you'd only be slowing down transaction times for these blacklisted addresses, not stopping it.


This has been pushed around, but I don't believe bandwidths are much worse in China. At least my experience in a number of major cities had a very decent speed. I think things can get much slower using a VPN and sometimes the government may throttle traffic to certain non-Chinese websites so, say, Baidu loads faster than Yahoo, but I don't believe this affects bitcoin traffic or would be an issue with the current blocksize proposals on the table.

This is exactly what you need to argue to convince me. If the increase of a Sybil attack is non-trivial, both in absolute and relative terms, then you have an argument. If it is trivial, then there's no reason to care when that comes at the cost of limiting how many people can participate in and transaction with Bitcoin at any one point.


So you're assuming Bitcoin provides *no value* if you don run a node? Are the millions of people who run wallet software irrationally using Bitcoin because it provides no value?
You are *permitted to choose whom* you trust to tell you the state of your money. You are not reliant on any central authority or set of authorities to know the state of your money- that's the power of Bitcoin. And you aren't reliant on any specific node. If one node or a set of nodes becomes unreliable, you can switch to any other set of nodes- including your own. The mere fact that this is possible also discourages the risk of such chicanery.

What *practical* effect would halving the hashrate actually have on the security of the network? I'd argue it's not necessary or desirable to maximize the security of the network at all if there's a cost associated. The network merely needs to be secure enough that an attack on the network itself is prohibitively costly, not infinitely or maximally costly.
By your own equation, I'd argue that increasing fees both decrease transaction volume, and at some threshold hinder participation and usefulness of the network itself, thereby reducing the price of a bitcoin. In the end, rising fees could be counterproductive.

No, you can't practically mine bitcoins from a laptop or any CPU really. I mined maybe .1 BTC a day from a laptop in 2011 or so, briefly, but those days are long, long gone.
With a specialized mining rig, you sign up for a mining pool, which is trying to solve a block. When the pool solves a block, it receives, 12.5 BTC, which it divides up amongst the participants based on the amount of work each participant contributed. I also don't recommend acquiring a mining rig.

Well sure, then define what the immutability of the ledger is, as this is what our disagreement hinges on.
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:57:49


That's the concern then. I mean, if you can't suggest the marginal risk from a decrease of n nodes resulting if the blocksize increases to size x is at least non-trivial, it's not really an argument, right? The increased risk of  Sybil attack may be non-zero, but is it non-trivial for the block size increases being considered?


Now perhaps I'm confused with how nodes work. If you connect to enough nodes, shouldn't it be possible to verify the longest chain? And can you better give an example where this is actually relevant?


If you're unbanked you're almost certainly poor and you almost certainly don't have the education or resources to obtain and power a constantly connected computer to a network 24/7, 3g/4g connection or not.


Is your argument then that everyone *has* to run a node? That's silly. And it's something Satoshi never envisioned. Sure you have to trust the node to provide you with balances, but if you're like the overwhelming majority of the world and can't read code, you also have to trust whatever software you install, and whatever hardware you're running to execute that software properly and non-maliciously. To say you're not benefiting from Bitcoin's security *at all* because you don't have your own machine validate your transactions is ludicrous. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:58:02
It's a fair enough distinction you make- I think immutability is taken to imply irreversibly, which as you argue is not the case. So the fork at least effectively violated the irreversibility of a transaction by creating a transaction that did the opposite then?

Blocksize isn't really an issue to people running full nodes.
Larger blocks would be more taxing on internet connections for full nodes. If you're in an area with data caps, it could limit your ability to be an effective full node, one that serves up a lot of blocks to others.
It would, as you note, add couple of dollars a year to the cost of maintaining a node for storage.
Yeah, sure, there's going to be some people living in Nowheresville that wouldn't be able to accommodate a full node if the size increased. But so what? Satoshi never envisioned everyone would run a full node. And if the cost of hundreds of thousands to millions of additional transactions comes with the price of some people with subpar connections or hardware being unable to run a node, so be it.
@_date: 2016-09-11 21:06:06
Is it crucial to run more nodes? What metric are you relying on to suggest their are too few? Are wallet clients unable to sync? Transactions don't propagate?
Look, don't get me wrong here. I run a node with around 60 connections now that uploads at least a few hundred GB a month. I did it because it's a fun exercise, I basically had the hardware lying around, my connection's decent, my router can prioritize traffic so I haven't experienced any noticeable performance hit, my data usage meter from Comcast is broken so I don't have a data cap, I need a node to run Joinmarket and my earnings from running Joinmarket more than exceed the power costs.
But a lot of people aren't in that situation and I see people who are shelling out what seems in the ballpark of a hundred dollars a year or so to run a node on a VPS and it seems kind of silly. If it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling you're making a difference, great. But from what I can tell, everything would be exactly the same without one extra node- you're inconveniencing yourself while providing negligent benefits to others. If instead you bought and held bitcoins, you'd be making an investment for yourself, and helping to increase the scarcity of bitcoins, which would further drive up the price, and increase the economical incentive to mine, which would drive up hashrates and increase network security, while further encouraging development of bitcoin applications.

To really ELI5:
Some people want to send their bitcoins to someone else without other people knowing they sent them. Or they want to make their own coins more private. So Joinmarket lets people mix up their coins with other people so it's not clear who owns what. People offer up their coins to get mixed up and get a fee in return. People wanting to mix up their coins will accept these offers and "tumble" their coins and pay a small fee to do it. 
It's safe and secure too.

Take your backup seed (the 12-24 words) and break it into 3 or 4 chunks, and a couple copies of each, ensuring you can get the order correct later on. 
The issue with that scheme is that with every unique retrieved piece an attacker gains more knowledge about your wallet, and it becomes easier and easier to break. After 8 or 9 words in a 12 word wallet you're toast. Even 6 words may be brute forceable.
Instead, I'd suggest splitting the words using Shamir's Secret Sharing. This will let you break the words up into as many pieces as you like, with as many as you'd need to recover. Importantly with each piepieby itself you learn nothing about the secret.

You need more than 64 GB for the whole blockchain. The blockchain is ~82 GB and rising at a rate of about 40 GB a year at present pace. I got a 128 GB Cruzer UltraFit for my RPi2 bitcoin node for $30 but would even recommend against that because it's only going to be good for another year or change, and it's slow as crap to store the block chain. Forget that it's a USB 3.0 drive, it performs shit operations per second and is incredibly slow to write. I tapped it the wrong way, corrupted the drive and needed to reindex- it's been going on *three weeks* to reindex!
If you want to run a node on your RPi I'd suggest getting an external hard drive. A 1 TB drive is around $50 and should last for years no matter the block size. On the other hand, I have serious reservations about the RPi2/3:
* 1 GB of RAM is really a crunch to run a full node on. It's doable, but I've had serious stability issues when trying to run other programs simultaneously. If you run out of RAM, you'll use the SD card for virtual memory which hell.
* The RPi2/3 shares it's Ethernet 100 Mbps bus with its USB 2.0 bus. That's a huge, huge bottleneck which hinders your performance no matter your connection speed. That means you have one 480 Mbps maximum theoretical combined total for your RPi2/3 to (1) download the blockchain and new blocks from the internet to your RAM at a maximum theoretical 100 Mbps (2) write that information to your USB drive (3) read block information stored on your USB drive (4) send that block information to other nodes. The end result is that it's going to take a week plus to sync the block chain initially and while you'll be able to manage connecting with a few dozen nodes, it's going to be a real pain if anything goes wrong.
Personally, I switched to an old Celeron 877 netbook lying around and loaded with Lubuntu and have had a much better experience. I was fortunate in that I had an old 500 GB PS4 hard drive lying around as well as 8 GB of compatible RAM from an old upgrade also available. With a gigabit ethernet connector not sharing the same bus it's not limited by it's bus either. It uses ~9 watts when idling as a node with the screen off, which translates to maybe 50 cents more electricity a month than the RPi. I realize not everyone has spare netbooks/notebooks lying around, but if you do have one or the means to acquire one I'd highly recommend it instead of the RPi.

It's not that they keep paying taxes, it's that they can't defer income realization  until after they flee. The wealthy typically have the benefit of timing and adjusting how they realize income. Say I've made a startup company in the US. 10 years down the line, my stake is worth a billion dollars. How much in taxes do I owe on my shares? None, because I haven't sold them. If I sold them, I'd owe capital gains on all of them.
Now, without a law like this, I could renounce my citizenship, skip over to Monaco and sell all those billion in shares, avoiding several hundred million in taxes. That's not cool.
I'm very sympathetic to removing income taxes, but if we're in a paradigm where people owe taxes on their income, allowing people to run out of a high tax country to realize income they built in that country isn't fair.

Take a look [here](
1 MB blocks have a limit of roughly 7 transactions per second.
Paypal handles an average of 115 transactions per second.
Visa handles an average of 2000 transactions per second, with a maximum peak of 56,000 transactions per second (rarely seen)
So a ~16 MB block would allow for a limit close to Paypal's average. A 286 MB block would allow for a limit close to Visa's average. An 8000 MB block would match Visa's peak.
16 MB is almost certainly adequate for the next 12 months.

Not quite. The FEC has not explicitly limited Bitcoin donations to $100. The FEC issued an advisory opinion AO 2014-02 in response to a proposal from Make Your Own Laws Inc (MYL). MYL proposed accepting up to $100 in bitcoins, the current limit for cash contributions, following a certain procedure. The FEC approved their proposal, but has not given any sort of guidance explicitly limiting Bitcoin contributions to $100. They could approve of Bitcoin donations greater than $100 or they could disapprove. But they've definitely green-lighted donations of $100 and less.
If you're running a campaign and don't want to waste the time and resources seeking another advisory opinion or accepting more than $100 and potentially running into hot water down the line, you play it safe and limit contributions to $100.
Ultimately the FECs decision to accept $2700 Bitcoin contributions will hinge on whether Bitcoin is seen more like cash ($100) or a "check, money order or other written instrument"($2700). I think the distinction boils down to the traceability and proof of ownership of funds. I think Bitcoin's kind of in the middle of these two categories- yes it comes from an address and is traceable in the Blockchain, but addresses aren't easy to connect to anyone the way you'd connect someone to their bank account.

It's a good question that honestly doesn't have a perfect answer. Obviously you need a node if you want to validate your own transactions instead of trusting another party. And there needs to be enough nodes to let other people broadcast their own transactions who aren't running their own nodes. You also want enough redundancy so a particular geopolitical event or natural disaster doesn't disrupt the network too much or risk the destruction of every copy of the blockchain.

The problem is that it's an argument that has no practical significance under block sizes being presently comprehended.

Rereading the white paper, you're correct in that first two contexts. However, the "rules and incentives" that can be enforced would include other protocols. I'd have to look at other definitions of the Nakamoto consensus.
It is fair that Satoshi is not our Jesus. But if we are trying to determine fundamentally what Bitcoin is, what could be added to Bitcoin in what way and still be Bitcoin, or what would become an altcoin, whether a thing is in keeping with the intent of the founder of Bitcoin is one way to judge whether or not that change would still be Bitcoin.

If we want to assume that is true then this change *doesn't* leave block size completely in miners hands, with zero recourse non-mining nodes can take. Under that reasoning, miners will never propogate blocks so large they substantially risk their reward. If nodes do have representation, they act as an inherent check on the size of blocks.
If nodes don't have representation (as is outlined in the white paper that representation is proportional to CPU power), there still isn't a problem. You also have yet to outline a blocksize where nodes would be unable to keep up but miners are able to propogate the block without delay significant enough to risk an orphan block and lose their reward. 
Whether or not nodes have representation in a meaningful capacity is irrelevant- under either situation, miners will be naturally incentivized to limit the size of their blocks at a point that doesn't compromise the function of nodes.

Yes. Shamir Secret Sharing is really, really brilliant. 
It lets you take any secret text and split into multiple pieces and that can be reassembled with a certain number of those pieces. The magic is that each of those pieces by themselves give you 0 information about the secret itself, so an attacker doesn't get any closer to your secret is they steal less than the number of pieces you require.
Would highly recommend people check it out. There are a number of python scripts which can do just that.

@_date: 2016-10-16 15:43:16
So long as sufficient nodes exist to accept those blocks and get them to miners it doesn't matter. Nodes don't have representational voting. Read the white paper.
And you're saying this problem only occurs when blocks are a few GB? Holy hell, for one, this is a problem when Bitcoin is a transacting during a peak volume as a global reserve currency, constantly. Secondly, there's no way miners could reliably propogate blocks of that size without costing precious seconds that could cause them to lose the block reward.
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:57:58
So miners would consistently push through blocks so large that nodes couldn't download blocks in the 10 minute average or so it would take to discover them and would fall behind? That first assumes such consistently large amounts of traffic we've never seen before. 
The relay network is fast, but it's not *that* fast, especially in China, right? You can't have blocks so large nodes on ordinary broadband connections can't keep up over a 10 minute period, but small enough it's not causing critical latency delays in propagation for miners. Maybe I don't know the speeds here, but what size blocks are you talking about?

All these things are true in terms of increased resources, but they have no practical marginal cost. My device usually idles at around 5-10% while running the node, joinmarket and a monero node. It wouldn't be beyond the CPU's capabilities at all, and for security purposes I don't use it for anything else anyways.
My router does a good job of prioritizing traffic, so it'll prioritize things like my laptop or streaming movies over node traffic. The result is that I can't see any noticeable impact on my bandwidth, despite maintaining 70-100+ connections. I don't have a cap either, but that shouldn't actually impair a nodes ability to verify transactions for the owner, only, as you mention, be a very generous node.

From my reading segwit would prevent old nodes from validating their own transactions. That doesn't seem like a rule old nodes subscribed to. I assume, if nodes are so critical, that their being to validate transactions is also essential.
Ultimately the longest chain with the greatest PoW controls what rules Bitcoin adheres to. In that sense, it all rules are enforced by the consensus mechanism of PoW from the miners.
The author of the article you cite doesn't appear to have mastery of English as a first language and as such it's difficult to follow.

And that risk should be borne by individual miners. Just like a free market in which individuals set their own price, so too should miners set their own block size. It's like a price discovery mechanism- I learn through trial and error what propagates and what doesn't maximize my returns. Some individuals might find 1 MB blocks are good, others might find 10 KB are best. And still others may find that 8 MB or 16 MB blocks are worth the risk, especially if a backlog of high fee transactions have piled up.


It doesn't matter how smart you are, one single entity can't decide the "best" price or capacity better than the market. This is why things like price controls in socialist governments- where very smart individuals sit down and decide what's a "fair" price for both producer and consumer fail. They inevitably lead to economic waste, inefficiency and shortages. It's great that very smart people have pointed to an increased risk of orphaned blocks- let the market act on that information. 
Miners will weigh the added fees they can take from a larger block versus the risk it won't propagate and decide on a size that fits them. This already has occurred with 1MB blocks, with most miners deciding on 1MB. Do you really think that decision is the limit of the miners or that of an arbitrary speedbump put in place?
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:28:16

I think control might be too strong of a word here. It's influencing them, it's weighing on their decisons, but miners are ultimately independent free entities who are capable of acting however they want-- with the obvious caveat that they bear the consequences of their actions.


I agree that they'd be mining something that would be worthless, but the question is, would it be Bitcoin?

If it were limited by propagation times, the market itself would adjust to the optimal blocksize. Already miners can choose to mine full blocks, no transactions at all or something in between. You don't really think 999kb is somehow a perfect size miners would have chosen absent the arbitrary limit, do you?
Individual miners should dictate the maximum sizes of the blocks they want to mine and will discover the proper size ratio that offers the balance of fees to the risk of propagation failure. Sometimes it will not be worth mining especially large blocks. But this flexible mechanism will incentivize bigger blocks to be mined when the fees are high enough- to the extent you reduce the backlog and increase overall thoroughput. But whatever the case it should be free market of miners with the power to choose their individual size that let's them maximize their rewards- not some programmers.

Wait, well, ultimately, if every miner supported a new proposal for Bitcoin, then that becomes Bitcoin, right? Short of delving into a philosophical discussion of the Ship of Theseus and the semantics of identity, if, let's say for the sake of argument, every miner begins mining blocks adhering to a new standard with a full node, then Bitcoin is that new standard, right?
This is certainly different than miners actually *controlling* everything. Whether or not users support that decision will enforce or undermine the price. That acts as a particular feedback which incentivizes or decentivizes particular miner decisions.


Except miners are ultimately incentivized to maximize the value of Bitcoin. If miners ever contemplated raising the limit to create 21 million and n bitcoins, the market response at the violation of the fundamental assumption of a predetermined and predictable Bitcoin supply would be so vitriolic that it would completely undermine any hope of increased profits by the miners through added supply, perhaps to the point of near total collapse. It would be contrary to the miners own rational self-interests to do so.
Central banks exist with agendas and interests not related to maximizing the value of their currency. By inflating the currency and printing ever more money, central banks allow government debts to roll over and remain paid. In many cases then the central banks benefit from actually weakening the currency. Ultimately central banks have no accountability to hardly anyone. A tiny group of actors can act without the agreement of anyone.

Sure, competing blocks can and do happen. That's why miners have such an incentive to make sure the network accepts their blocks first.
I'm uncertain what the concern is here at this point. There's direct incentive for miners to accept and process as many transactions as possible under your assumptions. The only time this would become an issue is if Bitcoin is so large as to be one of the largest global exchanges, at which point average bandwidth will have caught up to the point even those blocks aren't unfeasibly large.

Because the CPUs and bandwidths presently in existence are more than adequate for that, as current requirements aren't taxing on existing hardware. It won't cost 8 times as much to run a node even if every single block is 8 MB. 
I run a node on an old netbook I bought 3 years ago at KMart for $200. It's got a 500 GB drive I took from a playstation and I'm in on a middle-of-the road 150 Mbps connection offered out in the middle of Tennessee. If, hypothetically, every single block were to be 8 MB immediately (which is purely hypothetical and different from merely allowing a maximum 8 MB, as that constant amount of traffic doesn't exist presently), my costs wouldn't increase substantially. My old Celeron netbook CPU would handle it plenty fine. My connection would download just fine. 
My hard drive would fill up faster, sure, but it'd still last for a year or so. Then, after a year or so, I'd upgrade to maybe a 2 TB drive, which goes for about $75 right now, probably less by then, and last for another 4 years or so. The marginal cost of moving from a node capable of running 1 MB to 8 MB full blocks, all the time for me would be maybe $1.60 a month or so. That's pretty trivial, on par with the cost of electricity to even run the node and something I'd gladly absorb if it meant bitcoin could grow 8 fold.

And again you're assuming you're knowing 10% of the network won't accept them.

This should help with the basics: 
A *good* full node is one that's up 24/7 and constantly serving up as much information to as many other nodes as possible. Anything that hinders that hinders your ability to be useful. If your connection is always dying or your node goes offline all the time, it's not good. If your connection has a bandwidth cap so you can't serve us as much information, or it's a slow connection, that's not good.
The system you use should have 2 GB of RAM minimum, probably more. You need enough space to store the entire blockchain and associated files now and into the future. The blockchain itself is roughly 85 GB and increasing by about 40 GB a year, so I'd suggest a minimum of 250 GB of storage- the 80GB recommendation is out of date. You probably should look at larger storage to avoid needing to upgrade so soon. 1 TB will last for several years under any estimate.
Personally, I use an old Acer AspireOne netbook on an ethernet connection. It has 8 GB of RAM and a 500 GB drive and a surprisingly powerful 1.4 ghz dual-core Celeron 877. It's small, quiet, energy efficient and slips behind my couch when I'm not checking it. I bought it for under $200 a few years ago and had it lying around. The RAM was a hand-me-down upgrade from another laptop and the HDD was a hand-me-down upgrade from my PS4.

If 90% of the network tries to mine bigger blocks with more transactions- great! The other 10% will need to get their asses into gear!

So what. None of Bitcoin is resistant to the "wealthy get wealthier" effect. Even outside of mining, some plebs will put in a few hundred dollars and come out with tens of thousands in bitcoins. Others will put in a few million and get out a few billion. Nothing wrong with that.

Sorry, paying the minimum fee needed for a miner to take the transaction in the time you want it is the right price, not the greedy one. I wouldn't pay a 1320 BTC fee to some miner for a fraction of a second in CPU time if I were transferring 44,000 bitcoins. I'd either lose $500,000 in fees or end up with a pissed off buyer if I were to do that. That makes zero sense.

Well it's not really a full node with a pruned copy of the blockchain. It's more of a transaction-validating node. I thought a "full node" was one that received, stored and served the full blockchain to peers. If you can't or don't serve all of the block chain you're just a node.

Not really. Certainly there were British contributions, but it's very unfair to call the internet or modern computers a mostly British invention. And in any event, it doesn't follow that a particular British person must invent Bitcoin because other people in the country made technological innovations. Really anyone in a developed nation could have done so. The NSA outlined cryptocurrencies nearly a decade before Satoshi.
Why would you need a British education to use British grammar? And why would you need to be British to have a British education? Plenty of international schools in Asia teach British English. If you were trying to remain anonymous, it'd probably be a poor idea to use idiosyncrasies that narrow you down to just a fraction of the English-speaking world.
I'm not saying Satoshi isn't British, but there's simply insufficient evidence to be thoroughly convinced.

Stories like this do make me wonder how many BTC have been effectively lost in total, especially from the early days. There have been self-reports in at least the 10s of thousands from losses, glitches and burns. [This claims several million, but that would represent the absolute upper bound](
Ultimately it has significant consequences for current Bitcoin users, as it means there are far fewer coins actually in existence. A smaller supply means lower liquidity, greater scarcity and a higher effective rate of bitcoin increase from mining.
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:11:26


Why are you so much better informed than the market? Why not let individual miners decide if they want to mine 50 KB or 1 MB or 2 MB or 8 MB? Miners can and do already set limits well below 1 MB for various reasons. Miners will mine at what they believe is optimal sans artificial restrictions.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Fast Relay Network *is* for miners, right? I can't compete with that no matter what, so what's the point?
Personally, running a node, I don't see extraordinarily fast block propagation times to miners as one of my real objectives. I want to make sure as many people as possible have copies of the most up to date blockchain so people can spread and verify their transactions and also to create as much redundancy in the network so that the block chain would survive in the event of localized disruption affecting countries or continents.
Miners are going to have the incentive to make sure their blocks are propagated  the fastest, so it's natural they'd want to make investments in their hardware and networks to accelerate that. I'm not sure what's so bad about that?

Yeah, but so what?  If the FRN goes down, you're talking about, what, a few milliseconds to seconds delay in block propagation? That makes a big difference to miners getting a jump on the next block, but is of minimal concern to the network as a whole. The fact that it makes such a small difference in disrupting the network really suggests it would *not* be a target by someone trying to halt Bitcoin.


Well, no, a decentralized system probably can never be *as fast* and why is that a goal? If the difference in propagation has no practical improvement for the network, increasing it at a appreciable cost in other aspects isn't worthwhile. We want *good* block propagation times, but if moving from *good* to extraordinary requires compromising the number of individuals who can participate in bitcoin, well I'd take good block propagation and more participants than extraordinary propagation.

The 21 computer is a complete joke. Most people who buy it are confused as hell and think they can make a return on it. It's not ever going to pay back more bitcoin than buying bitcoin now, so it's just an intellectual curiosity. But if you really just cared about just running a node and getting a little bit of programming experience you'd buy a raspberry pi. If you didn't want the raspberry pi experience and just wanted a node, you'd just buy an old windows netbook for $100, connect it to wifi, install the bitcoin core and set it and forget it.

This is not a new service from 21 Inc. You're exactly describing a mining pool. Mining pools have been around for years and nearly all mining occurs through pools nowadays, as it's basically impossible for a single mining unit to ever find a block. A mining pool distributes work to participants, and when any individual in the pool finds a block, all participants in the pool are rewarded with a share proportional to the work put in, which is just a tiny fraction of a coin for most units.
This is the smoke and mirrors of 21 Inc- making you think they've created something special and new and worth $400 when they've just taken the same stuff and made it look cooler.

Those are fair assessments of why you believe bitcoin will succeed, but that's not to say you know the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk. You FEEL like it is. Hell, I feel like it is. That's why I've put butt-tons into Bitcoin. But in the end, we don't know the odds, we're merely speculating on them. So we can't say someone should buy Bitcoin because the upside potential IS far greater than the downside risk.
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:08:32
Yeah, but there's "not much of a profit"/revenue and really, essentially $0. An Rpi2 mines at 0.2 mh/s. Your rig is almost a million times more powerful.  That would generate roughly one ten-thousandth of a cent a month. I don't even know if most mining pools would be capable of making payments that small. 
I get there's a "haha I'm going to bake cookies and sell them at the farmer's market, how cool is it to participate in this even if it's not really making that much money on net" fun of mining. But with an Rpi2 you aren't even really participating.
As an aside, I'm very glad I sold my BFL single for 45 BTC after mining a 25 BTC block.
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:29:57
That's not a very fair analogy. But ultimately the Bitcoin protocol *is* whatever miners want it to be, even if they are not the only actors in the system.
The 1 MB limit was a temporary stopgap placed in the system with the intention it be removed.

I don't think Dimon has waged a war. He's just given an opinion that governments aren't going to permit Bitcoin to function and Bitcoin consequently isn't a worthwhile investment.
Now you can say he's WRONG, that Bitcoin can't be censored by the government and will continue to operate, but you can't say he's waging a war.
Personally I think his opinion is pretty reasonable. Sure, most governments can't stop Bitcoin itself, but they could stifle and squelch any hope of a mainstream commercial adoption and consequently limit its impact. It wouldn't be hard for a government, especially a notoriously totalitarian one, to make prohibitions advertising Bitcoin acceptance, engaging in Bitcoin transactions or being in possession of private keys.
"Oh hurr hurr, they'll never be able to find me, I'm behind 8 proxies and Tor and have multisig private keys to cold wallets with triply encrypted private keys hidden around the globe!! Bitcoin for ever, blockchain for eternity!"
Sure, look, you can get away with it. Lots of people can get away with it. Bitcoin mining and nodes will probably always exist somewhere. But you're significantly limiting the future public acceptance, and hence the value by driving it underground.  Put prohibitions in place, and bye bye ETFs. Bye-bye Wall Street trading. Bye-bye reliable exchanges. Bye-bye investment news coverage. Bye-bye Apple Store and Google Play apps. Bye-bye QR code on your food truck. Bye-bye moving fiat to any account known to have traded in bitcoins. Bye-bye any hope of any retailer with a public-store front putting up any mention of Bitcoin. And bye-bye any hope of return on investment.
Bitcoin derives its value from BEING money. Unlike other contraband, like say, drugs, which will increase in value if you make them harder to get, Bitcoin value DECREASES as it becomes less easy and less accepted as a medium of exchange. So I don't think he's all that off.

Probably right? The risk of an orphaned block exceeds the additional reward of added fees taken in by mining a bigger block up to at least 1 MB. The same logic should apply then to slightly larger blocks, at the very least then, right? Blocks aren't going to magically fail to propagate at say, 1.1 MB. There's going to be some non-trivial increase of risk of orphanage at some point and at some point it'll basically be impossible. Where that is exactly, I can't say, but the network itself will be able to feel that out.

If those studies are correct, then miners will gravitate towards that blocksize and increase it as computers and infrastructure advance. That's way more efficient than trying to have technocrats meet every year or two and debate what the markets should be fixed at. You can verify your own transactions just fine on a pruned node and there's no suggestion proposed blocksize increases would practically hinder that.

I don't disagree that Bitcoin has yet to gain a place in mainstream finance. But it is fundamentally insulated from the movements of the stockmarket, central bank decisions and capital controls.

@_date: 2015-10-14 18:13:15
No but that's the point. It was a real problem. People were freaking out. Then everyone put together steps to fix it and diligently went about it. As the deadline approached, efforts further intensified. Everything transitioned over without a hitch.
I believe the same will happen here. BIP 101 is in play. As blocks start to get maxed out consistently, panic will ensue and the price will drop. Holdout miners, out of self-interest will transition well before total doom arises.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:34:15
Originally, it was efficient to mine using an ordinary CPU. I recall my laptop's quad-core chip being able to generate .1 BTC a day. Around that time, it was determined that graphics cards had powerful GPUs capable of calculating hashes many times more efficiently. So huge desktops were rigged up with as many GPUs as possible and run as hard as possible. That created a huge amount of heat, so big operations like the ones shown in Silicon Valley would need ridiculous fans and cooling operations.
Then new, specially designed bitcoin-specific mining devices, made with ASIC chips came into being which greatly exceeded the output of even the most extreme GPU units. Because rewards are proportional to the total network power, it meant the rewards for these older GPU units plummeted. And when the value of rewards substantially dropped below the cost of electricity to power these fans and GPUs, they got the boot.

I think it sets a dangerous precedent to go about forking Bitcoin so that those who omit to do something lose their coins. The ability of the majority to strip a minority of stored value is contrary to one of Bitcoin's core appeals.
What if we learned ECDSA-protected addresses would start being broken in 1 year? 6 months? 3 weeks? How soon would be too soon to permit a softfork?
And why is it up to us to say that it's wrong that old-coins be suddenly recirculated? People never joined Bitcoin that coins would be lost at any particular rate, or that they'd actually know what that rate would be. Surely people have assumed some coins thought lost would be recovered and recirculated, how can this be said to be too much? And, importantly, if we know ECDSA-protected addresses are going to be broken in X years, why shouldn't bitcoin participants be able to price this possibility in before what we've deemed inevitable occurs?

As the price increases, long term, you'll see smaller volatility, simply because it becomes harder and harder for single individuals to move the entire market.

That's a snazzy line, but let's be real here. I haven't and can't read the bitcoin core programming.

Then I'm trusting that my hardware is actually running the code in a way that actually produces good output and there's not some hidden NSA backdoor in these chips that actually messes them around and makes them process transactions incorrectly. Node or no node I'm trusting other people's work to tell me about my bitcoins.

I believe this is the same argument suggests that a large miner or many miners should form a cartel to withhold a blocks it solves and get a jump on the next one.

Nodes need some sort of financial incentive to run. You can't expect Bitcoin to exist because of people's goodwill. Transaction fees could be split with nodes. You'd only need a teeny tiny portion of miners fees and it would incentivize the creation of tens of thousands of nodes. It costs around 10 cents a month of electricity to run an old netbook, less using a raspberry Pi or other units. Give people running nodes 1% of transaction fees. For March, that'd be roughly ~$900 BTC-equivalent. That would easily support the maintenance of 9000+ nodes. How exactly you do that, I'm not sure, but it's what's going to work, not some goddamn charity drive.
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:14:24
I'd really recommend you look at using your RPi2 to setup a node, if you're looking to participate and help the Bitcoin network. It'll be a fun project and you'll be assisting other people in the network.

I had been running a netbook as a server. Then I stopped using the other server functions and had no other use. Paying for the monthly electric bill just to run a node didn't really seem worth it.
I'm trying to start back up again with a Raspberry Pi, but it's just a bitch. I need a 128 GB drive if I want a node that can run for a year. The USB drive I'm using over USB 2.0 is painfully slow. I thought I could save some time by copying over a more complete blockchain directly. WRONG. I needed to reindex and that's taking easily 4 hours to reindex one week.

Nearly everyone stays, at least for a bit. Yields may be cut in half, but profits may not be halved in fiat terms- ie a price spike would justify continuing mining. Individuals investing in mining today are doing so with the anticipation that they will make a profit and therefore that the market will justify their continued mining post-halving.

I have a very fast connection, clocked at 100-130 Mbps down over wireless. I think it may be the upload speed of the nodes I'm connected to, as it seems like I'll see random bursts of progress. Maybe that's changing speeds or changing block sizes. The Pi cpu show bursts to 100%, but generally it's using under 30% of the cpu. Otherwise it could be limited by write speeds to the USB drive- I'm using a 128 GB Cruzer Fit USB 3.0 drive, but it's limited to 2.0 speeds on the Pi.

I run a full node on a raspberry pi. BUT it's pretty easy to see why most people don't. There are significant marginal costs to getting a full node up and running.
* Lots of people don't have always on systems. They don't have desktops. They don't have a big ol' nerd box of computer cables and components. They have a laptop/tablet/whatever that they move between home and work or school. Their computers are in standby mode when they aren't being used.
* Even if they are running an always on system, they may not be interested in having the hassle of a resource sucking program running all the time and occupying ~50-60GB.
* If they don't have an old energy-efficient netbook or other hardware lying around, the costs are pretty significant. You need at least 64 GB of storage, and honestly probably 128 GB if you want a setup you can use for a few years. We're talking $80 to $100+ if you don't have a big ol' nerd box of parts lying around. And unless you're savvy enough to setup a raspberry pi, you're going to be pitching in $10-30+ a year in energy costs to run a laptop/netbook.
* Even then, it's not a set-it-and-forget it strategy. You have to be regularly checking for updates, or be savvy enough to find or code a script to do it for you. Units crash, need updates and all sorts of work. Even at a reasonable 3 hours per year of maintenance, that's another $40 of value someone has to put in.
And all of those costs are for altruism and a sense of personal satisfaction. Lots of people are not in a position to donate $100+ a year to charity, why would they find the money and time to donate it to a node?

I misspoke and thought I was replying to a different comment- you're correct that a node without a full copy of the blockchain is not a full node. I apologize.
A pruned node still provides a valuable service of verifying someone's own transactions and prevent manipulation for particular users.
A full node is any node working to obtain and maintain a complete copy of the block chain. When I say a super node, it's is probably a bit more subjective of a term, but one that connects to many, many individuals with very high bandwidth to serve up its full copy of the block chain.

I've been trying to setup a Raspberry Pi 2 B node. Let me say, it's not at all user friendly for someone with no prior experience. Even after getting it up, it had taken nearly 2 weeks to sync the blockchain. I decided it might just be easier to copy over the blockchain from another system. WRONG. I waited days for the chain to reindex.
I think my choosing a compact and cheap but slow write drive (Cruzer Fit USB 3.0) may be the source of my woes. You could do better buying a cheap 128 GB portable SSD.
But you're kind of already moving from the "have some fun with stuff you already have" to the "spending a decent bit" to run a node. Honestly I've had good success with an old Acer Netbook:I think this is basically the same model: 
The processor is actually pretty decent and the 160GB drive will hold the full blockchain for a good while. Windows 7 is very easy to get a node running quickly. Honestly once you consider a Pi pretty much requires a wi-fi dongle, a bootable microsd, a wired/wireless keyboard/mouse, a monitor, a mouse, HDMI cable, power supply, case and a 128GB+ storage, the Acer looks pretty damn good unless you already have the former lying around. The Acer does use more power than the Pi, but we're talking about a few dollars of electricity a year.

The tyranny of the majority exists whether it's a simple majority or a supermajority- a large enough group of people can compel individuals to do something or lose control of their wealth.
There's are always unpredictable periods of what is essentially monetary inflation in bitcoin, by your definition. Coins are constantly being taken in and out of cold storage and being lost and recovered. We have nothing but speculative insight as to what that supply might be, and yet we're fine. Satoshi could re-emerge tomorrow and decide to sell a million coins for all we know. Why is that acceptable, but knowledge that some coins will almost certainly re-enter the market in 5 years is not? 
If we're really concerned about the unexpected movement of coins, why stop at ECDSA-protected addresses then? Why not require individuals to move their coins every year to prove ownership or see destruction?

I mean, the present state of the economy doesn't disprove something contributing to a long-term trend. It being cold today or even an all-time low for an area doesn't disprove global warming.
It's reasonable that the constant creation of dollars and purchasing of assets through QE could have negative long-term consequences if continued unabated.

No, It's exactly my point. Bitcoin fluctuates so much because it's so small. When it's bigger it won't fluctuate as much.

Miners have already priced in a large number of considerations in their decision to mine, including fluctuating difficulty rates, fluctuating bitcoin prices and the inevitable halving of block rewards. 
Most miners are only going to shut mining equipment down when the costs of electricity exceeds the value of yields from running the equipment. As the vast majority of investment in mining is in the upfront sunk costs of the equipment, not the electricity, I would imagine this would lead to only a slight decrease in mining activity under stable price conditions. Even if miners look as though they'll lose money on their investment as a whole after the halving, they'd rather continue running paid-for equipment to reduce losses than completely halting mining.
As a result, I would not expect a sudden decline in hash rate once the halving occurs, even if the price remains stable. Miners will hold out for some time, hoping for an increase in the price.
It's possible the price will not immediately increase because of the halving. People should be able to price the halving into their purchases. Surely people are purchasing Bitcoin today with the expectation the price will increase with the halving. That information is, at least in theory, reflected in the price right now.
That said, not everyone is a participant in Bitcoin. Halving block size rewards could significantly reduce liquidity. A relatively small influx of demand after the halving could lead to a liquidity crunch and drive the price significantly upwards.
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:38:09
I think that's right. The clincher there is that the correction the long-term. An exchange with slight but significant deviations in price or deposits and withdrawals of funds would take days to weeks to months (Mt. Gox?) to be identified as broken.
While the market will probably sort out issues in the long-term, bad information could have serious consequences on price and price velocity.

My laptop was making ~.04 BTC a day in May 2011 off of a junky NVIDIA graphics card, less on the processor.


Yeah that was just not possible in 2012-2013. To mine ONE thousand a week, you'd have to have 2% of the network hashpower at a 50 BTC reward, 4% at 25 BTC. This would only be possible if only 50 CPUs were mining in 2012, so ONE thousand a week is not possible with one CPU in 2012. A few thousand is crazy talk. 
It may have been possible for individuals with a relatively small budget to have built a bunch of GPU mining rigs in that time frame capable of mining 11000 BTC over the course of two years. But we're talking about several to tens of thousands of dollars in investments and a lot of time maintaining them- an effort and undertaking that the author never seems to convey. And if he did, it's not as though one forgets about earnings from such an investment as easily as one might forget about earnings in the background.
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:25:06
I don't think mining is much of a cash cow at all. I'm saying that people mining now have already considered the costs going forward and I don't believe many have plans to shut down immediately after halving, to the point difficulty won't keep up. Most miners will be willing to stick it out for a few weeks, anticipating a bump in bitcoin prices or others leaving. It may not work out for miners, but the network will be ok.
Fair to include rent, time and taxes. But still, same equation, if rent+time+taxes+electricity&gt; value of bitcoins mined -&gt; would make sense to continue mining.

Here's an estimate:
You're going to see a skew of bitcoins held by a very few, like any other Pareto-like distribution of wealth. Assume that Bitcoin holdings follows the same global distribution as that seen in global wealth. By knowing the number of people with at least a certain amount of wealth relative to the total, we can estimate how many people will have at least a certain number of bitcoins.
[Total global estimated wealth is 241 trillion]( [Forbes puts the wealth of the 500th richest person at $3.5 billion]( That's .00145228% of the world's wealth. So, assuming 21 million bitcoins (not true at the moment, and given losses, ever), it would suggest 304.98 BTC would put you in the top 500.
[Forbes estimated]( There were 1826 billionaires in 2015- that is, owning .00041493% of the world's wealth put you at number 1826. 87.1353 BTC would put you in the top 1826 globally.
[Credit suisse estimates] ( 128,000 individuals with wealth exceeding $50 million. At that rate, 4.36 BTC puts you in the top 128,000.
[Another Credit Suisse estimate]( puts 1.19 million people with over 10 million in assets. So ~.1034 BTC puts you in the top 1.08 million.
[The number of millionaires is a little more contentious,]( but an estimate of total assets held (fair for us) is 35 million. Doing the same math, .08714 BTC would put you in the top 35 million.
I think these are pretty reasonable guesstimates. I'm not saying 87 BTC is going to make you a billionaire, only that it's reasonable that no more than a few thousand other people would have more.

All of this is premised on the assumption that you know the odds are in fact in your favor. A $1 lottery ticket has will only lose you $1 but the potential gain if you match the numbers on a big jackpot is $300,000,000- would you be willing to risk losing $1 if it meant you can win $300,000,000? 
Is the "upside potential far greater than the downside risk" for a lottery ticket? No. Why? Because we in fact know the odds in advance and can definitively say it's not. You don't know the odds for bitcoin. Consequently, just because there's a greater difference between $290ish and $1 million than 0 and $290ish doesn't make the upside potential far greater than the downside risk.

I guess it first assumes you have blocks that large. Secondly, you're assuming no other detriment in making blocks that large. It's not like you can just slap a flag on the block you mine and it's ignored by 10% of the network- you've got to make it huge and face the consequences of that. If you decide to make enormous blocks that are ignored by 10% of the network you're still almost certainly going to be experiencing substantial propagation delays in the rest of the 90% of the network. There's a cost associated with orphaning blocks. You also *have* to have the knowledge that this 10% is constantly and consistently going to be rejecting your blocks.
Finally, like any change in consensus rules, there's going to be a strong incentive for the other 10% to accept larger blocks and adhere to the rest of the network. That's the mechanism in place to incentivize change for most hardforks, right? If 90% wants to hardfork something, then the other 10% have enormous incentive to switch, right?

That's not an incentive. The tiny marginal increase in the integrity of one's bitcoins from running a node is worth less to almost any individual than the cost of maintaining a node. Having a copy of the blockchain might have some sort of value, but this can be accomplished without running a full node.

Right, it's fluctuated by about 2 days In the last few weeks. If the price keeps increasing we may see an uptick in hashing power, which would speed the halvening. I personally would love a July 4th halvening.

The cost per hash could decline, but that's not going to occur on already existing units. There may be new units arriving with a lower cost per hash, but the likelihood that occurs before the halving to justify the investment is slim.

Bitcoin's cap is only $8 billion if you assume all Bitcoin still exist and could be used. In reality tons of Bitcoin private keys have been lost, destroyed or forgotten. Based on the reported numbers of lost coins, it's not unreasonable a million or more coins could be gone.

* They want an easy way to setup a bitcoin node- If a Raspberry pi is too above your heads, I don't see how this is much easier.

Yes absolutely. It doesn't create any issues with Bitcoin's viability, but it does affect the potential valuation of a single Bitcoin unit. All of these current market cap calculations are too high as a result. 
Consequently, hypothetical projections if the value of an individual bitcoin in certain situations (ie, value if it matches a major world currency, remittance payments, etc) places *too low* of a value on each Bitcoin.
It also means the halvening will have a significantly greater impact on the rate of Bitcoin currency creation as a percentage of total currency than if no coins had been lost.

I expect every halving to eventually have an impact on price, but I'm not sure each subsequent halving would have a greater impact, in fact I think it would have a reduced impact.
If you still think so, riddle me this: by the 24th halving, there will be over 20,999,998 bitcoins created. Fewer than one bitcoin will be mined over *four* *years*. With nearly all of the supply created, why would this have a greater impact on price than the first?

People wanting to make their coins less traceable will pay a small fee for each "join" they make. You place your coins in a joinmarket wallet and then run the yield-generator program in the background. You'll get a couple joins a day or so, each with a small fee attached. Over the course of a year, it'll probably work out to around 1% of the coins you've invested.
That number can fluctuate, but it's hovered around that for me. If more people start requesting joins it could get more popular and yields might increase.

"Coming for your retirement funds" is a bit of an exaggeration, but this is somewhat of a real concern. If the Feds were ever to impose negative interest rates, you'd likely see fees on your idle savings and checking accounts. Investing in a money market fund would be an easy way to escape those negative interest rates. Requiring it to be in a federal fund does not free you from this.
Essentially then, this is the Feds setting the stage to make negative interest rates a feasible possibility. If people can't hide funds in money market assets, options to keep cash safe and stable are severely limited, especially for a 401k account.

An ETF is like a mutual fund that trades like a stock. Except a share in an ETF can be a share in pretty much anything, not just a company.

Well sure. So how do you set up an escrow service which is automatically established for every transaction at a brick and mortar or an online store? You'd need both the merchant and the end user to be signed up for whatever service is in use most likely in advance, unless you want to inconvenience the end user and make him sign up for a new escrow service in a checkout line. The escrow service should be implemented automatically on a pre-agreed set of terms- you shouldn't have to set the terms of escrow when you're picking up some groceries. You'd probably want an escrow system that can give authorization of payment immediately without waiting 10+ minutes needed to confirm a transaction in the blockchain, hmm maybe the escrow service can verify if the payer is credit-worthy, assume the risk and will track him down for assets if he double spends. You'd basically end up with something that resembles aspects of the current credit card system today, with bitcoins. Fees could be lower, but you'd still need a trusted third party to investigate the claims.

Not necessarily. BoA might integrate bitcoin into its merchant payment system at some point in the future. The article implores people to "Make sure your merchant system supports an alternative payment solution", "err on the side of simplicity" "think about designating an IT person on staff (or outside the company) who can troubleshoot problems as they arise." That all sounds like good advice if and when BoA offers a bitcoin payment system.
BoA would be able to cut Visa/Mastercard/AMEX out of its payment processing services provided to small businesses and keep a bigger cut for itself while keeping fees to merchants lower.

Oh wow, so since Bitcoin would need to have 8 GB blocks to handle Visa at-its-peak levels, and 8 GB blocks are unfeasible, increasing blocksize is terrible and 2 MB blocks are misguided.
It's such a strawman argument. No one is saying blocksize increases alone are going to allow Bitcoin to scale to Visa- levels with today's technology. Combine segwit with larger blocksizes and we'll go a long way on current technology.
2 MB or even larger blocks do not pose a technical challenge on today's systems. And if miners think it does, they're always free to propagate smaller blocks, as some miners already do.

I don't find it a very persuasive argument. Bitcoin definitely has some advantages over credit cards, but those advantages cut both ways:


Ok sure, so it's ever so slightly faster to get into Bitcoins, in theory. I run a business which takes credit cards (and Bitcoin) but I wouldn't say the application process with my credit card processor was much more strenuous than say, coinbase. And it's not like the application process was a big deal to begin with


Great for merchants, but could deter consumers. One reason people pay with credit cards is that they know they're protected against fraud, unlike cash. Credit card companies almost always side with the customer. I've had charge-backs filed by customers who claim their card was fraudulently used to purchase products which were sent to their billing address and win! Sucks for me, but customers know credit card companies will back them up.


Fair. On the flip side, no cash back rewards for consumers.


Well sure, you could generate an address with the snap of your fingers, but this would basically be the equivalent of setting up shop with a big "money goes here" box instead of a register that gives receipts. If you sign up with coinbase to get an equivalent amount of accounting, the process takes about the same amount of time. Actually took me a bit longer to integrate coinbase because the module required some tinkering.
Other downsides vs. credit cards:
No interest-free float: Sure there are big fees if you keep a balance on a credit card, but how about if you pay off your balance on time? That's a 30 day grace period of zero interest. And interest can add up, but consumers are able to spend money they don't have, which from a merchant perspective is just great (if they go bankrupt it's not as though credit card companies come after you).
Also, what else is instant, has no fees, charge-backs or applications and hasn't taken over the credit card industry? Oh right, it's cash. Obviously cash has some other issues- the need to carry/physical storage, potential for theft, added transaction time to make change, potential for counterfeits. 
My point is not that bitcoin is awful or won't catch on with merchants, but rather that the features stressed in the video as "seismic" either aren't that big, can be a con and/or are already seen with cash. All of these payment options- credit, cash, and Bitcoin are a mixed bag with various unique features. Bitcoin definitely will find a place, but the unique nature of credit cards ensures credit cards aren't going away. Perhaps we'll see credit card transactions in bitcoins soon.

It can't. The way I read it in the article, the author portrays "Wall Street" as something that creates legal instruments and provides an enforcement mechanism- which isn't really a lot of Wall Street. Even then, just because you can make a currency follow certain rules (say, a will can be made automatically pay to someone's account when someone's dead and then prevent them from spending the money all at once) it doesn't eliminate the need for someone to create those rules in the first place, only perhaps the need for litigation and a court to enforce certain regulations.

Basically. I can recommend the financial company I used, if you like. 
It's a self-direct IRA, which means you can invest contributions into about any non-unacceptable asset using a checking account in the name of the LLC. The unacceptable assets are basically limited to things you or family/friends could benefit from before you hit retirement age- you can't buy yourself a house, invest in a friend's company, etc. Also no collectibles- so you can buy bullion grade coins, but you can't buy one-of-a-kind type investments, say a special carpet or an ultra-rare coin with collector value- probably again going along the lines of you deriving benefit. Bitcoin is pretty clearly in the acceptable category as a uniform asset/currency.
I should note that I'm not a financial planner or attorney, so this is not financial or legal advice, just a description of my understanding of the rules.
It's not all candy canes and lollipops- you've got to pay a pretty decent chunk of change upfront ($500-$1000? don't recall) and then various account fees of ~$120+/annually. The account fees can be paid outside of the contribution limits. For me it made a heck of a lot of sense because the annual fees get relatively piddly as your account grows (fees are flat and not a percent of the account). It takes a bit of paperwork to get started, but after that, there are maybe three forms a year to complete.
Message me if you want to know the company. I do get money if you sign up, so I want you to know that before you go throwing your money around.

I mentioned Bitcoin offhand to one of my Chinese producers and they were modestly interested. They already make me send wire transfers to a different personal bank account every time so they don't have to report the income as taxable and those transfers are slow and expensive. A fee-free service that's basically instant could be very appealing. Given the volatility of Bitcoin though I'd imagine I'd have to make the transfer very quickly after receiving the invoice and they may wish to convert it very quickly as well if they don't want to play the market.
As far as the ethics of being complicit in facilitating Chinese tax evasion- not my country, not my problem. I pay my taxes to Murika and that's all that matters to me.
I'd much appreciate a PDF, written in Mandarin that explains bitcoins and its benefits, including an easy way for a Chinese citizen to get a reliable wallet and good Chinese exchanges. I assume online wallets are bad choices since it would be fairly easy for China to block access to US online wallets or shutdown and seize Chinese online-wallet sites. Is multibit or another client available in Mandarin?
I already send ~$100k a year to China for goods, might as well have that go through Bitcoin.

I was using a thought-experiment, sorry for being unclear. Gold can be used for things other than a medium of exchange whereas the utility of the dollar and bitcoin are strictly limited to their ability to be exchanged in transactions as a store of value. If you were living on an isolated island, gold could still have utility and therefore some value. Absent other people or other people valuing them, dollars and bitcoin become completely worthless, minus whatever negligible value a piece of paper or a private key has. 
Bitcoin is worth X to people ONLY because people believe other people will pay them X in goods,services, dollars, whatever. Gold is worth X to some people in part because they can use it to make something. Do you see the distinction I'm driving at? Bitcoin will collapse absolutely if no one believes others will give them anything for it ever. Gold will not collapse absolutely...though it can crash substantially.
Again, I don't think this makes much of a difference in the asset price, as gold price is mostly driven by investors/speculators looking to hold gold just like dollar or bitcoins, not industrial use. The author's distinction is pretty much irrelevant.

Your argument doesn't follow. Yes, if you have and keep yen, you do not need to pay taxes on it when the value of the yen increases if you keep yen in your pocket. But if you buy yen and exchange it into dollars later at a profit, those gains are taxable. I don't see why this would be any different for gains derived from selling Bitcoins.
The IRS laws on income are broad enough to cover Bitcoin. Whether you were to buy gold, yen, a rare comic book, a masterpiece painting or anything as abstract as the rights to a web domain or a patent and sell it at a profit, such gains are taxable income. Whether the IRS treats Bitcoin as a currency or commodity, gains from selling it is still taxable income. Even under a pure barter system, economic gains are technically taxable as income- see [IRS topic on bartering income](

Yes. Trading on a secure platform that big-time investors are accustomed to without the need to store bitcoins will attract big money.

This will cause the trust to purchase more BTC, constricting volume on other exchanges and driving the price up there.

Adding CPU mining to the network to strengthen it is like wrapping aluminum foil around a tank for extra reinforcement. 1% of CPU usage by every bitcoin client cannot both be an insignificant amount of power and at the same time perform enough hashes/second to make any difference whatsoever in network security. CPUs are far less energy efficient per hash relative to ASICs-for example a quad core Core i7 pulling 50-60+ watts might put out maybe 20 MH/s at 100% if you're lucky. That's 2500 W per GH vs ~5W/GH for a 60GH/s BFL single- nearly 500 times the power consumption!

I don't exactly understand the original author's mention of dollars and I'll ignore that, but let's go with gold.
The price of gold is determined entirely by what someone else is willing to pay for it, you're correct. But WHY someone else (the market) is willing to pay what they are for gold isn't entirely because they believe others are or will be willing to pay that much or more for gold in the future. Gold has intrinsic properties which make it useful for many applications- electronics, medical applications, jewelry, etc. *Absent any other individuals wanting or demanding gold bullion, a person could still derive utility from gold ownership for personal use or for creation of other items.*
Now, I'll concede that that's a fairly small portion of the price of gold. The market demand is largely fueled by speculators or those who are looking to preserve their wealth- they have no intention of having gold for any other reason or purpose than the fact that other people are willing or will be willing to pay for it. But the fact that gold can have significant value to a person even if other people decided gold was worthless means there's some minimum floor.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, derives all of its value from being a medium of exchange. Hypothetically, if there was no way to transfer Bitcoin from one person to another, Bitcoin would be absolutely worthless. Bitcoin has value ONLY as a thing to be exchanged to others for other goods and services.
I don't follow the authors take on dollars. Dollars also have value only as a thing to be exchanged to others, and derives its value entirely by what someone else is willing to pay for it. Dollars have utility in that they can be used to be pay taxes and repay debts, but this is simply value derived from the fact that others are willing to recognize it (in this case the US government). 
Bitcoin also has many utilities as a currency, like the US dollar which provide value, such as anonymity, ease of transport and transfer, prevention of counterfeits, a certain maximum supply, etc. But these values, like the dollar, are all contingent on someone else also being willing to pay or value Bitcoin.
But is this at all relevant to Bitcoin or gold's future value as an investment? Not really. Gold might have some minimum threshold below which it may never drop, but honestly that could be pretty low. Gold really hasn't proven to be all that great of a protection against inflation.
tldr; Some assets would be valuable to a person even if no one else was willing to pay for it or recognized value in it. Gold is one of them. Bitcoin and the dollar is not. It probably doesn't matter in the real world at all.

Again, your definition is consistent with your analysis. I disagree with your definition of commodity, not your analysis of bitcoin as it relates to your definition. Since we're arguing over the definition of a categorical word, we're arguing semantics. 
Human wants is such a vague term, can't the want of preserving value through a semi-anonymous system be a human want? I think you're conflating commodity with natural resource. Other things that strictly physical goods are sold as commodities- for instance, carbon credits are sold on commodities markets. What human want do carbon credits fulfill?

Well, let's look at Webster's definitions of virtual:
being on or simulated on a computer or computer network &gt;&gt;&lt;print or virtual books&gt; &lt;a virtual keyboard: as
a :  occurring or existing primarily online &lt;a virtual library&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;virtual shopping&gt;
That definition is more specific to bitcoin than a digital currency, as it encompasses the fact that bitcoin exists within the bitcoin network. The online network is essential for bitcoin to be used as a means of value transmission and really bitcoins, if they can be thought of as being "stored", are stored within the addresses in the blockchain.
It's a digital currency as well, but most of our world's currency is already digital- as it's represented as binary numbers, transferred from one computer than another, never existing in paper form. Calling it a virtual currency is a bit more specific. And virtual cryptocurrency really has it pegged.
We can get all up into pedantic semantics and such, but it's both a virtual currency and a digital currency. Chill bro.

I'm not sure he'd do it willingly and unwillingly methods would have to be implemented post-conviction. Being able to decrypt the private key would be self-incriminating evidence and Ulbrich is currently claiming he had no role in SR. Decrypting information and the fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination is an unsettled topic, but it would be an interesting case. Here however, the point of him decrypting the key is more for the sake of seizing assets than obtaining evidence. I's difficult to hold him in contempt of court unless he's already been found guilty of actually running SR or there's strong evidence he owns the encrypted keys- suppose Ulbrich isn't behind SR as he maintains? You can't hold someone in contempt for not providing something he doesn't have. And would the FBI really be willing to lessen what's probably a life-sentence (or several) just for the sake of getting ahold of some cash?

Yes, and I think a company like Visa getting into the game would be a massive leap forward in merchant acceptance, usability and allow for instant Bitcoin payments and eliminate the risk to merchants of double-spending.
Applicants would have a standard credit check done and choose their "native" currency. Visa would extend a certain credit limit to risk on individuals and provide them with a credit card usable at every terminal. When a user makes a purchase, Visa immediately credits the merchant account and bills the user to be paid in 30 days. Since Visa is taking on the risk of double-spending, merchants don't have to worry. If purchases are made in USD, Visa would charge the user the bitcoin equivalent plus a currency exchange fee, just like it currently does when an American makes a purchase in Euros or Yen.
The addition would allow every merchant to immediately accept Bitcoin and allow customers to access and use bitcoins in a manner that they're already familiar and comfortable with. The system would also allow chargebacks, which is a plus to many consumers but a con for merchants. Since the card contains no actual data related to a specific bitcoin wallet, the system would be much more secure. Fees to merchants could be much lower.

A basic two page how-to PDF with a few screen captures of BTC clients would be sufficient, no fancy graphics needed
I. Why Bitcoin? Not issued or controllable by a single government, essentially zero fees, secure, semi-anonymous
II. Creating a bitcoin account-"a wallet" (listing of a single Mandarin-compatible btclient accessible over Chinese firewalls)
III. Locate the address associated with your wallet and give it to the person to be paying you (screenshots of said client showing where address is.)
IV. Client pays you
V. Exchange your BTC for yuan at (reliable chinese exchanges go here) or hold onto it

If Paypal ever did decide to get into the Bitcoin game, they'd have the enormous capital and infrastructure needed to comply with regulations, exchanges, fraud detection and would have an enormous competitive advantage over up-and-coming Bitcoin payment processors. Thousands of websites already use Paypal for processing already and could easily be shifted to support Bitcoin with no need to update software. 
Paypal would also save on transaction fees. Paypal has been looking for years to reduce its processing fees by encouraging direct bank transfers instead of credit cards for payment. Bitcoin would do just that and allow Paypal to keep a bigger cut of fees.

We're basically arguing semantics here. What defines a commodity? I certainly agree that bitcoins aren't consumed and can't be used in production- are these essential defining features of a commodity or merely traits which commodities frequently have?
"A class of goods for which there is demand, but which is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market...." "has full or partial fungibility" "its price is determined as a function of its market as a whole." Certainly sounds like bitcoin.
In the end, certain terms really aren't rigorously defined enough to allow for absolute classification. By some definitions, for instance, Bitcoin could be described as fiat. But that's irrelevant, so long as we know what someone means when they describe Bitcoin vs. fiat currencies.

If we're really looking at this to gauge Bitcoin's use as a payment network it could be less than 1% of that if we're looking at movements between two individuals to be used a currency. Most of this is just going to be folks moving bitcoins to and from an exchange or within their own personal wallets. 
If you look at the total transaction numbers for a time period, bitcoin only register 67,000 compared to Discover's 5 million. That's an average of $6650 per bitcoin transaction vs. an average of $87.60 per Discover transaction. Which transaction amount is more representative of a payment network? Which amount looks more like investors moving in money?

But with 10% owning 90% of stocks, they're the ones who matter the most in driving the price up. Winklevii's ETF will open soon enough.

How is bitstamp.net right now for accepting USD wire transfers in the US? Seems their volume is on par with Mt. Gox at this point.

An investment is an asset acquired with the intention that it will probably appreciate in value or be resold at a profit. Whether these are good investments is certainly debatable, but these are investments.

You point out a key flaw that I keep seeing in Bitcoin's criticizers arguments- the idea that just because the technology around bitcoin isn't well-established enough to make it mainstream, it never will be mainstream. If Joe Redneck can learn to use an ATM or an online bank account, someone can setup a service that lets him send and receive Bitcoins.

You're describing a correction, not a bubble. Have you ever popped a bubble? How much is left after you pop it? Basically nothing. That's what happens if there's a bubble and it pops.

I'd imagine the very high inflation rate and difficulty of exchanging the Bolivar for a more stable fiat currency or more bitcoins might discourage entrepreneurs.

Yes! Clearly the media couldn't like bitcoin because it's a constantly changing story involving paradigm shifts and potential rise and fall of fortunes people might want to read about. Must be a global conspiracy.

IF Bitcoin gains widespread adoption and is traded on the level of the USD, Euro, Yuan, Gold, or even smaller currencies, $500 is tiddlywinks. Note the big IF.

It's port 8333. Totally depends on your setup, but you should try to make sure your firewall isn't blocking it and the port is open on your router. If you get more than 8 connections, you'll know it's open. It may take a while to get enough connections.

Who are you to say what people do and don't need for various purposes, or by sheer fact that they aren't the best tools for a specific, acceptable purchase that they're immoral? They convey additional utility beyond conventional weapons for legitimate uses. Your criticism rests on no tenable grounds.

Agreed. If you believe bitcoin must succeed and you brand everyone who has doubt or disbelief as a bunch of conspirators out to persecute you...you better check yourself.

There aren't in terms of Bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin miners with a lot invested in hardware are going to see a negative return, but it's not like this hasn't been seen from a million miles away.

You are correct. The Fed has generally targeted a slight positive rate of inflation and can take steps either way to increase or decrease that.

Yes. Though it's just going to be a temporary stepping-stone until XBT gets traded on FOREX

The taxes you would take in on income that the exchanges make from fees could easily be in the billions in the coming years. But an overly regulated environment will see American dollars and tax revenue heading to overseas exchanges.

Not really. I run a Windows 7 netbook as a full node. It's got a dinky 1.4 Ghz dual core celeron but runs just fine. The bitcoin client uses maybe 2-4% of the processor. Uses about 500 MB of RAM, and can use a pretty sizeable bandwidth at times (sometimes &gt;1 Mbps, but I've limited this to 2 Mbps outside of the night.) 
Assuming you have enough storage and a good enough connection, pretty much anything above a bare-bones netbook should be capable of acting as a node.

If a friend with the keys liquidates the coins anonymously and donates a portion of it to his legal defense fund... who's to say that the $2 million that's poured in is from the $80 mill that disappeared from the address?

Or it's a currency. You still owe taxes on gains derived from selling it either way.

I think it's both about failing to make a section 83(b) election in conjunction with the AMT. The way stock incentives are set up, the IRS usually considers them as income once the options vest, unless a section 83(b) election is made. If the stock crashes in the next year and the taxpayer sells, he can take a loss, but losses cannot exceed taxable income for the year.
So Joe Blow goes to work at startup A and is promised 10,000 shares currently valued at $0.01/share of stock which will vest after 5 years. If he doesn't make a section 83(b) election, he'll be taxed at the value of those shares in 5 years time. In 5 years, the stock is now worth $100. Joe owes taxes on $1 million in income if he didn't make the election, even if he doesn't sell. If the stocks collapses early the following year, he won't have the money to cover the taxes. His losses for next year will only be deductible to the extent of his income for the year. Sucks to be Joe.
 tldr; This whole situation applies to stock options vesting, not to bitcoin. If you don't sell or transfer bitcoins, you won't be taxed. Also, not legal or financial advice, just my understanding of the system.

Politicians have a way of delivering very subtle jabs at their opponents. Also, the way Warner described bitcoin really makes me think he might have a stash and want to burn Kirk. 
"It's kind of like cell phones, they totally changed our lives. People said they wouldn't take off...but boy I'm glad they were wrong since I invested in Nextel and now I'm filthy rich"...hmmm, in the 2 months you've been learning about bitcoin, a thing you see as being extremely similar to your previously extraordinarily successful investment, you wouldn't invest?
