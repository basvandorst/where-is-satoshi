I literally facepalm a few times a day now while thinking about this.

They were on crypsty - same eventuality, right?

Sorry for the miscommunication, I wasn't trying to short the current price to gamble - rather I'd want to buy calls to offset the current "short position" I'm in. For example, if this were any other currency market, I'd have the "right to buy" at a higher price for a lower price. So for example, if bitcoin jumped up to $10,000 each, I could exercise each contract and buy it at $5,000 each.
Thanks for letting me know about the HD seed thing, I will definitely look into that for future security.

What is the prevailing hardware wallet? I guess I'm going to just start buying small sums I can afford on coinbase

Is it still possible to join the suit against Cryptsy? 
I currently don't have possession of anything other than some mined Dogecoins which I'm already considering "theirs" - I want to take responsibility for this and realize I might be paying it off for awhile.  Just to be clear, there's no options market right? Like I can't hedge my risk from the price continuing to skyrocket?
Also sorry for the questions, what's an "HD seed"?

It's true and has been giving me frequently mild panic attacks. I actually vomited when the price reached 2000, and now it's encroaching on 3. 
I guess I'm also worried the price of BTC is going to skip up to like 50,000 and so effectively I deprived them of "becoming rich"- should I just tell them to buy coins on their own right now and I'll pay them back for that?

Thanks for the info. Also just sent me down a rabbit hole looking into Bitfinex's margin trading. Do you not trust them anymore after the hack?

Yeah I understand, thanks anyway though. I guess this means there is no options market? How does bitcoin plan to be a global currency without an options market? Any large orders for business are hedged against currency fluctuations risk with it.

That seems fair, thanks for the idea. I thought Bitifinex was still around?
