not sure what you are saying.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:16:43
I posted it in a couple of threads.  Too much downvote for that one.  Who would invest now?  Do you guys even have any experience in investing?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:59:26
wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:14:07
Neither a shill nor someone that thinks they know everything.  I am just someone who is cautious and a bit suspicious of things that appear all too easily out of the blue.  There is no way to disprove that I am a shill and I could be a bit of a house slave on this thought but, I kind of get a bit put off by the fact that most people here are not very knowledgeable in a traditional sense. The intrinsic value argument reigns supreme fro me.  I saw Obama get voted in on purely propaganda...(he did the impossible).  But reading many of the posts here it seems like a similar campaign.  I cant say I am popular and those that know me closely do like me--but, I would not want to part with my money just yet.  Good luck, Paradox.

that is good that they made a reference right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:13:59
get lost.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:01:13
and people were doubting me yesterday...
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:22:50
are you being serious?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:16:11
I am no economist, but I do not understand why these posts are not met with open arms?  
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:21:06
mainstream media is bad but soda drinking youngsters on a website may not qualify as a sound investing strategy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:06:07
you must be nuts.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:49:16
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:06:02
You do not believe that they are all trolls do you?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:23:11


why are you trolling them?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:57:05
Fair enough, but then it becomes propaganda.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:24:44
you dont belong investing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:18:19
I'm probably not much older than you.  I have accepted life.  Have you?
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:13:15
haha.  Yup.  how can you not wait out the weekend before buying?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:09:46
its going to fall.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:15:21
so why is no one calling this post out?  
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:02:55
Well, I am older than most so my post will inevitably get downvoted, but this community is full of younger kids who are glib in their opinions--I get most of it--people have bitcoin craze going on and no time to post..but the worst reaction to a presidency and regime built upon meme and corporate talk is a "revolutionary" website designed to undermine the corporate structure.  Seems counter-productive and an easy means to control.  You do not even know who you are talking to on here and whose advice that you are listening to.  Once someone expresses a point that is contrary to the consensus'--it is met with harsh criticism.  I prefer types that recognize trends and think outside-the-box.  Maybe I am just middle-aged.  But, conventional wisdom does rule once in a while.  If you have little understanding of psychological phenomenon or history-it would be hard for me to listen to your 'financial opinion.'  I am no economist-by any means--however; I do realize how to seek out "sound-advice."

Oh thanks. I was just so accustomed to seeing them post months ago.  My suspicion tells me...well, whatever.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:19:43
Thanks for filling me in.  When I was on here months ago it seemed all that we had were the neigh sayers.  I disliked the posts then.  "BUY"BUY" sell sell. tulips..
