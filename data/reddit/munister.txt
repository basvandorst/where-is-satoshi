I've already been cynical about the government for a long time. It's what drew me into Bitcoin. But as I got older, I realized that to not engage with the government was a waste of precious time. One way or another, we'll have to deal with the government, because of it's power. So why not engage them and steer Bitcoin legislation towards what we've always wanted Bitcoin to be?

Does your grandpa go on Bloomberg and talk about the latest guitar equipment? You see the difference? It's fine if Bill Gates doesn't know the new stuff (although it's ridiculous calling the 5-year old Bitcoin "new stuff"), but then going on a big media platform and sprouting misinformation hurt Bitcoin. More people will be mistaken in thinking Bitcoin is anonymous currency that is more used for illegal means, and that's preventing Bitcoin from being accepted by mainstream (which is the ultimate goal of any cryptocurrency). Unlike others here, I'm not accusing Bill Gates of having disingenuous intentions to mislead others. I'm just calling him misinformed and he needs someone to tell him that Bitcoin is pseudonymous.

How is calling what he suggests "totalitarian" suppose to help Bitcoin's cause? You do realize he's a lawmaker who can influence lawmakers to outright kill Bitcoin. Rather than going after Lawsky, why not propose changes to the legislation instead? Then, if Lawsky doesn't take our advice, that's when you can call names.
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:30:01
Try to understand that I'm not refuting any evidence you've presented. I'm just saying your evidence isn't enough to convince me that everything is hopeless. It may well be that Lawsky is just manipulating this issue to benefit the bankers. It may well be that he will reject any suggestions we may give him. You're very likely to be correct.
What gives me some hope is [this]( There is a growing movement of Americans who are politically active in rejecting money's influence into our politics. You can argue that that PAC is allegedly funded by rich donors (there's no proof), or that their proposed amendment needs editing, but the fact is that this growing movement may tilt things to our favor. 
So, I don't know Lawsky, so I don't trust him. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Then if he rejects our important demands from the legislation and only includes part of our suggestions just so he can say, "I've got the community's permission on this!", we can go after him with evidence of his manipulations and to never trust officials like him period.

Just because I don't agree with you, doesn't mean you can accuse me of being indecent. I want to see Bitcoin legitimized in the eyes of the public, and shed it's dark reputation, because *that's* what's going to keep Bitcoin alive and change society. We've wasted *years* trying to change the world through anti-government ideals when it was faster having it be accepted by the government for mass consumption. Now, when a good opportunity comes along, we're throwing it away! We need to change the resolution, now, before the government really tries to destroy Bitcoin.

Nah. He's feeling defensive because I called his argument nonsensical (and it is nonsensical, since he hasn't shown that Bitcoin is MLM). I did call MLM a flawed business model, but I never said blakflak4 should have a problem with MLM. He's getting confused.
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:29:15
Here's what I see. Lawsky is trying to install consumer protections. He's also trying to get Bitcoin users to buy US-denominated assets, which would benefit the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the big banks are fascinated by how much Bitcoin has impacted the financial industry. They still don't see Bitcoin as a significant threat, but they do see it as a significant asset to pay attention to. If more and more businesses are using Bitcoin, it would be in their best interests not to fight Bitcoin, but to adapt their banks to use Bitcoin as well. Why risk losing money to fight Bitcoin, when they can adapt its' technologies for themselves to gain money? Processing fees? Fines? If it's going away because of Bitcoin, they'll just figure out ways to make money off of Bitcoin. The smart ones adapt to new technologies, and those big bankers don't strike me as dumb. 
Lawsky and his team created this legislation based on years of regulations. They're not aware of the landscape of cryptocurrencies, so they don't know how much their legislation is actually stifling innovation. This is where the cryptocommunity must come in and change that resolution.

You may be misunderstanding my statement. I'm not arguing about the value of Bitcoin. I'm arguing that blakflak4 has not demonstrated that Bitcoin is MLM. I do not care about the fundamental value of Bitcoin because that value (like you said) is hard to define at this point in time.

Lots of them came over to Dogecoin because Dogecoin was a funny satire on altcoins. Other info (such as the inflationary "bug") came out months after launch. So it's not like Bitcoiners actively seek an inflationary coin. It was more like Bitcoiners finding out that Dogecoin is actually inflationary, and decided to stick with it. Still, that was a good answer. 


Lol. I may have been around longer than you. I remember mining Bitcoins on my CPU, and then when the difficulty went too high, I bought early generation Casascius coins. Fun times.
Deflationary economics unfortunately encourages hoarding more than spending. That means less transactions and less exchange of value. Now, one could argue that it's not the quantity of the transactions, but the quality of the transactions (instead of 500 $1 transactions, it's 1 $500 transaction). However, I'd argue that the quantity of the transactions is far better than the quality of the transactions, because multiple transactions affect more people than less transactions, which encourages more people to transact within that economy (500 $1 transactions affects more people than 1 $500 transaction). Bitcoin has a huge problem later down the road when nobody really wants to spend any Bitcoins, causing the Bitcoin economy to potentially come to a halt. Fortunately for current Bitcoin users, that's 40 years down the road, but it will eventually come crashing down, if the Bitcoin devs don't fix this problem.
Inflationary economics penalize hoarders in favor of spenders. But that's not fair to hoarders, who accumulated lots of money, only to be forced to spend it.
So what does Dogecoin attempt to do? Bridge the gap between spenders and hoarders. Have a deflationary inflation currency. It's really such a brilliant "bug" and one that most economists would be *very* keen on paying attention to.

See, this is where you're wrong. Centralized political entities were created because there's a societal demand for them. The Congress was created because of a need for control over the national level. Think national highways. FDA. There's a societal need for regulation over the national level. As much as I love decentralization, these centralized political entities (whether or not they're corrupted) are not "useless".
But more importantly than that, the popularity of blockchain protocol is currently reliant on the public financial image of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes down, don't you think that would negatively affect blockchain technology as an enduring success? 
You see government as evil. I see government as a tool that could be wielded by whoever is lobbying. That tool can be used for good or evil. Right now, we have a chance to wield it for cryptocurrencies' benefit, and you're all screwing it up by calling him names. Don't be so short-sighted. We actually have a chance here.

This statement is meaningless because it asserts that you see more than I do, which cannot be proven. I can say the same to you, but I'd have nothing to back it up. Our perspectives are different, that's all.


We're actually in agreement here, it's just your definition of "acknowledge" might be unclear. According to [Merriam-Webster](


I acknowledge that the government has power over us. It's the truth. It has power over you and will force you to perform certain actions whether you like it or not. So when you said:


It's a meaningless statement because the government won ever since 1787, when America established a bicameral Congress to govern America. They've had authority over us and will continue to have authority over us as long as we live in America. The great thing about the Founding Fathers is that they tried to have that authority *listen* to us. But they do have authority over us, and denying their authority over us is delusional. So let's get that out of the way.


Agreed. No argument there. But the Federal level doesn't seem likely to touch Bitcoin unless the states do it first.


Reread my posts more carefully. I've never said I support Lawsky's actions. In fact, if the bill's current form passes, I reject it and would encourage everyone to fight against it. I'd just rather we focus on changing the resolution to suit Bitcoin's benefit. Now whether Lawsky listens to us is debatable, but I'd rather we take that chance than to throw it all away just to satisfy our anti-government stance. We can't keep preventing Bitcoin's full potential as a game-changing technology if we keep fighting bills that seeks to regulate Bitcoin for consumer protections.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:59:12


Good for you. But a societal demand for religion is not the same as societal demand for centralized governance. We can be moral without religion. But we can't have a functioning nation without someone doing the dirty work of governance. Why? Because society demands for one!


Yes people aren't going to go apeshit when there's no government because the society itself will create one to meet its needs. Governance and society can't be separated. It's a natural social system humanity developed to address humanity's problems.


The FDA does work for you, but that doesn't mean it can't be corrupted (in fact, it's very corrupted right now). But they serve a national purpose to Americans, and without them, we may be sicker than we are now.


Every technology is reliant on popularity to thrive. Linux, HTML, Blockchain, SSL, and the list goes on and on. Without popularity, specific technologies would not be adopted so quickly by the public. Without popularity, technological innovation gets stifled (no funding for research &amp; development for tech companies). Does anyone use FORTRAN anymore?


And the point I'm trying to make to you is that, yes, Blockchain isn't exclusive to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is the most popular representation of the success of blockchain technology. If Bitcoin goes down now, this hurts the adoption of blockchain technology, which is the source of all past, present, and future cryptos. If that legislation in it's current form goes through, we're kissing blockchain goodbye in a few years. Look at the long-term, Eauylon. We need to change this legislation, not call names on the lawmaker who's willing to open a reddit thread for ideas and criticism!

It's not a fairy tale to push Bitcoin into becoming legitimized as a viable option, and I don't find Bitcoin threatens the banks' customer's interests.

I'm from dogecoin, and I have to say, congratulations to BitPay for their sponsorship. This is a step up for bitcoin to breaking into mainstream. This will raise visibility and viability of BTC. Keep it going! What's good for bitcoin, is good for the rest of cryptocurrency, including dogecoin.
P.S.: Quit trying to compete with Dogecoin. We're all in the same umbrella of cryptocurrency anyways.

Yes. And we gave them *power* over us because we want them to perform their tasks in a more efficient manner to benefit ourselves. Thus, they have authority over us. What's there to argue about?


I agree that regulations should be set at national/international levels. But that's not happening right now and they don't seem to understand it. The national Congress doesn't seem keen on touching this topic. The closest international organization we have that even mentioned Bitcoin is the World Bank, and they're calling Bitcoin ["a naturally occuring Ponzi"]( so they don't understand Bitcoin. The only ones willing to regulate Bitcoin are the states. So why not change the resolution to suit Bitcoin's benefits? This will only help.

This is what discussion on legislation is all about. Bitcoin community lays down their ideas based on their ideals, lawmakers lay down their ideas based on consumer protection (or some other reason), and we discuss things through. The final legislation will have many of the things we want and things that protect consumers. We're not going to get everything we want, but we can get the core principles down (namely, preserving the current state of cryptos). Otherwise, we get this crap legislation as is and that kills any current cryptos in existence. If that happens, we go after Lawsky hard. But let's not do that when the bill is open to change.

I've read the articles of SEC going against Voorhees. It sucks, he didn't do anything wrong towards society. But this may be more reason why we need the NY legislation on Bitcoin now more than ever. In SEC eyes, they don't see Bitcoin as legitimate investment. They see it as fraud, and warns the public against Bitcoin. If we legitimize Bitcoin as a viable investment option, that could eventually lead SEC to not prosecute people like Voorhees.

Lawsky created a thread in reddit specifically about this legislation. It means he's open to suggestions and criticisms. Use it to your advantage. If he ignores us and goes forth with the current draft, then we go after Lawsky hard. But if he changes the resolution with our ideas in mind, then isn't that a scenario we should pursue? Yes, he may or may not ignore us in the end, but we can't know that until it happens. So let's just try to change it now.

I'm not so sure about that, . If we can get the Congress to change their culture regarding money in politics, it may be possible to overturn this 1970s bill. Of course, changing their culture is going to be a monumental challenge.
Also, democracy can work and be the most ethical form of governance to its citizens. However, it's very reliant on its citizens to be both ethical, educated, and active in the political process, which is a huge problem.

So what do you want? Don't do anything? Let the resolution pass as is? You can distrust the lawmakers and big banks as much as you want, but I guarantee you if we don't do something to change this resolution *now*, Bitcoin, as we know it, will die. Businesses will eventually discard Bitcoin from their payment services. More and more crypto users will discard Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general because of the threat of the current resolution. We can't isolate NY from the rest of the world, because other cities are looking at NY as a guide to legislating Bitcoin. Bitcoin will crash harder than any of the previous crashes it's ever had and won't ever recover until this resolution is lifted because that's how damaging the bill's current form is. Don't you see? The answer isn't to do nothing. The answer is to change the resolution while we still can!

By trying to destroy altcoins, you're potentially hurting Bitcoin, because the public will see how negative cryptocurrencies are. This is damaging to Bitcoin in a crucial moment when legislators are legislating cryptocurrencies. Wake up! We need to band together here!

How do you know those banks are trying to get rid of Bitcoin? Can't it be the case that they're fascinated by the innovative technology this crypto has done? Can't it be the case that they're seeking to learn more about Bitcoin and adopting its technologies for their own benefit? Can't it be the case that they might actually support Bitcoin if it actually benefits the banks' bottom line? They're curious and seem unlikely to make a move against cryptos right now. If the legislation passes as is, I'm with you. But it's in discussion form right now! Use this opportunity to push forward a legislation that suits cryptos while you still can!

That's true with credit card companies. It's not necessarily true with banks that deal with currencies. They might be open to using Bitcoin for their own business. Don't you see? They don't know what to make of Bitcoin. They're fascinated with it's potential and are unlikely to mess around with it by adding legislation. Legislation that we can potentially steer towards cryptos' benefit. Don't shoot it down now while we still have a chance.

Thanks for the info.
Someone really needs to talk to him, because if no changes are made, then virtual currencies *is* dead, at least in NY. Nobody can really regulate this in the state level and those same regulators will be asking for lots of extraditions from citizens around the world at this rate. 


Good because now we can focus on rejecting this regulation. It's crucial that we play nice first to see what happens. Now we pool our energy into beating back this regulation. However, it's also important to note that there's still time to change this regulation to Bitcoin community's terms, and I'd rather we take that route.
I'd still like to know what the suggestions mailed to Lawsky were though and in what manner. That would give us a clearer picture of whether he took us seriously or not.
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:31:05


That's true if the government switches it's national currency to Bitcoin, which is highly unlikely. Don't we still have to pay taxes in national currency? Which currency allows us access to maximum services and goods in the nation? The national currency. So no, they don't care about Bitcoin's supposed threat. The government doesn't see Bitcoin as a significant threat, they see it as innovative that needs regulation. But they don't understand Bitcoin because they're not in the cryptoworld like we are. We actually can change this.


It's not about the amount of amends, it's the impact of each particular amend. Lawsky can spin whatever narrative he wants, but one way or another, we're going to have to engage with the law. We can choose to ignore the resolution and let it be copied by other states, which would serve to diminish Bitcoin's rising value to society, or we engage in it and see where it goes. The resolution will be complicated regardless of our input, so why don't we put our goals onto it and steer the resolution towards our benefit? Then if Lawsky rejects our most important demands, we'll have ammunition (and proof) that the government is out to manipulate us for their own benefit, which strengthens our stance of anti-government.

I don't think asserting Bitcoin is anonymous helps his cause. Bill Gates seems to be more focused on philanthropy and his legacy, rather than rolling out new products for his company Microsoft.

If all you're going by is the news, then yes, it seems like regulators don't do their job. But if you look more into the cases they've successfully done, the SEC actually has done a decent job while constantly losing funding by the US Congress bought by the big banks. They're not perfect, but they at least tried to do their job, and it'd be destructive to society if they were gone. I just see this at a big picture and I don't cast judgement on these important agencies just because the mainstream news media wants to sensationalize their news in order to get more money. You don't have to answer this question, but just think what would happen if those regulators are gone. What's to protect people from fraud and scams in the first place?

To add, we're all talking about Bitcoin's value as though it's quantifiable, when in reality, Bitcoin's value extends far beyond it's USD/BTC exchange rate. Bitcoin isn't just a payment system, or just a currency. Bitcoin is a method of exchanging information in a decentralized way that doesn't need centralized trust. As such, it is far more difficult to corrupt the exchanged information in Bitcoin than it is with traditional centralized methods. Once you fully understand the implications of this , you'll understand that why Bitcoin doesn't fit the Ponzi scheme at all.
