Great response man -- genuinely appreciate the openness. I've used Coinbase in the past, and will definitely be continuing to do so in the future.

Nicholas Weaver (of UC Berkeley) seems more than convinced. Check his Twitter account.

Your use-case and OP's are totally different. We need to make bitcoin work for all types of users. 
Maybe if *people actually could easily use bitcoin for everyday transactions and it made sense to do so* the price wouldn't be so damn volatile. Right now it's just another investment class that happens to be a digital currency, not the other way around.

On Safari and I'm a bit confused how to use it. Is support only for Chrome at this point?

No worries at all! I pretty much exclusively use Safari and you convinced me to download Chrome :)

Please link me, directly, to the "false information" he spread.

Why would I use bitcoin as a currency with all the price volatility? Moreover, why would I use it to buy any "real-life" thing if Bitcoin keeps appreciating so much? The sad fact is that *right now* Bitcoin is an investment that happens to be a currency, not the other way around. 
I own Bitcoin and have never spent one. I would argue that most people that have come to this sub in the last couple years are the same way.

How was any of the information Dimon stated about Bitcoin "false and misleading"? Legitimate, serious question for everybody upvoting this. Every great trade comes from a difference of opinion -- it's 100% okay to have people who don't think Bitcoin is all that.
