Try to stay objective, please. Also, it seems that you won’t be able to withdraw your funds from RH, which you can (for free) both on Coinbase and Gdax. I share (some) frustration regarding coinbase’s behavior and decisions (especially with bcash lol) but that doesn’t mean we have to stop having decent discussions.

You could circumvent the discussion by donating in Ether.

Other than technical reasons, one thing that attracts people to Ethereum is the aggressive roadmap (combined with current scale, not just theoretical), a solid team and various companies working with Ethereum (like Consensys). I hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum but I must say that the difference between Bitcoin's community, where everything feels like a civil war (either against Bcash or Coinbase or block size or pick one), and Ethereum's, is enormous. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:43:10
What are you looking for? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:58:58
That’s because the changes in bitcoin’s price, right? I can imagine they’re legally bound to refund the money, as you wanted to fund $100 but only gave them $99,91?  
Next time, send them $101 (or more) to make sure bitcoin’s price doesn’t cancel your tx.   
(I don’t see any other reason for them to do this. Other people refer to “government waste” but we’re talking about a privat company.)
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:38:11
Yeah, insured. Good luck with that. Whose gonna stand up for your pocket change, compared to the bigger fish waiting in line. Any amount over $2000 justifies a $100 hardware wallet. Easy.

The need for a central authority is strong. I really can’t fathom the immense paradox of buying decentralized assets only to hand them over to a centralized authority (except your hot wallet when trading). It completely blows my mind. “But they’re insured.” Factually, yes. Good luck in court.

I use the "What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars" definition, which is close, but slightly different. OP is *betting* - uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods. 
Gambling is done for psychological reasons. Gamblers gamble not to win money per se, but purely for the rush of winning money (see "The Gambler" if you want an example of a financially irresponsible gambler - not a betting guy). Doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1M, it's the kick that counts.

You should stop spreading this false information. Friedman was a proponent of government-issued (e-)cash, a far cry from the politically neutral and decentralized money that Bitcoin is.

Andreas addressed this quite reasonably, and I'm paraphrasing: "At least the bitcoin distribution is based on people that put money and effort in it, years ago, and they are rewarded now. That's very different from the everyday wealth, which was mostly created by brute force, wars and other horrors. That doesn't mean the skewed distribution isn't a problem, but we should put it in perspective."
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:11:09
Google "safe withdrawal rate" if you want to learn more about it. It's fascinating. Basically you start with your total yearly expenses (or monthly x12) and multiply that number by 25 (or 30 if you're more conservative and/or young ie. longer retirement). That's basically the sum you're aiming for. It doesn't really include lifestyle inflation, which is the big caveat. (You might start buying 500$ bottles of wine *because you can*, even though it's not in your current lifestyle spending.)

There is no such thing as "the reputation of bitcoin", nor can its "reputation" be "harmed" or otherwise in a general sense. It's unwise to personify a protocol. (Like we tend to do, computers don't really get *infected* with *viruses* but it makes for easy conversation.)

Exactly. The Ledger functions as secure access to your funds on the blockchain. You could use as many as you'd like to access your funds. The funds are not "on" the Ledger, they are on the blockchain and any Ledger (or Trezor for that matter) can access them through the 24-word seed. Which is why I recommend you get two, keep one close to you and put one in a vault. (or put both in vaults, helps the hodling as you're more steps away from selling!)

Those seeds (typically consisting of 12-18-24 words) are derived from a 2048 word list. The mechanism behind it is called the BIP39 mnemonic code. Compare the seed to html5 and the wallets (hardware, software, paper, ..) to browsers. You can access your funds (using the seed) through different wallets (like you'd access a html5-webpage through different browsers for the same result). So yes, you can use different wallets interchangeably and even simultaneously.

Paper has all kinds of issues but is okay as well. Best option is a hardware wallet (or two, in case your first gets lost / broken / stolen and you need to access your funds immediately) with a backup of your seed in a bank vault (or multiple vaults). It costs you a bit, but it's the only way of being sure.

Echo-chambers don't care about relevance. The "not your keys not your Bitcoin" is slowly but steadily turning into a political/quasi-religious like rallying cry. Doesn't matter if it's relevant or not. (Some people actually prefer to keep their money with a custodian, for example, but there's no space for nuance in a binary world.)

Yeah, but then hard drives fail, it might be infected with malware, et cetera. I'm not saying you *cannot* save it.

So, I'm going to offer my unsolicited "go-to" articles and books I've reread in the last weeks and months. Coming from the perspective of preparing for the next bull - you want to make smart choices once you have an abundance of options.      
* Paul Graham's Cities (  
* Nassim Taleb's Antifragile (  
* Jim Paul's What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars (  
* Paul Graham's Wealth (  
* Marc Andreessen's Four Types of Luck (  
* Alain de Botton's How Proust Can Change Your Life (  
* Hitchens' Letters to a Young Contrarian (  
* Lewis' The Big Short ( also recommend the movie (those guys *knew* they were right but took shit for months/years - paycheck eventually came)  
* Simler/Hanson's Elephant in the Brain (  
* Richard Bach's Illusions (  
* Will Durant's Lessons of History (  
* Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (  
* Robert Hagstrom's Investing The Last Liberal Art (  
And then anything from Matt Ridley, Krishnamurti, Malcolm Gladwell, Walter Isaacson. Can share more if you guys would like that, but I guess this is a nice list to start with.  
Plus I recommend giving Conversations with Tyler (podcast) a try, together with Sam Harris' Making Sense, Jordan B. Peterson's podcast and Joe Rogan, for some specific episodes, like his ones with David Goggins. Many of the above-mentioned authors were guests on any of these podcasts.  
Recommendations are welcome!  
Edit: I completely forgot a side project I'm doing - I read my favorite articles/books/podcasts so that you can listen to them on the go. Check it [here]( Maybe start with [Naval's How to get Rich tweetstorm]( It takes me a lot of work to read them but I'll add some more in the future :)

Not really. You had a .json file (still do) but compared to current alternatives, it was too easy to lose your coins. Same thing with MtGox. I believe that 80% of Bitcoin transactions (buying and selling) passed through that website. Go figure.

Some companies/protocols are working on this, like Compound ( Once it’s possible to tokenize your Bitcoin, you’ll be able to lend it. Or use it as collateral for Maker ( and take out a small loan against your own holdings, if that’s what you’re after.  
(I’m pretty sure some people here won’t like the idea of tokenized BTC, but it’ll happen. Better be informed. Also, these platforms tend to push towards decentralized governance, contrary to centralized services.)

There are a couple of million (100?) possible Grayscale customers, and billions of others who don't have access. The value in Bitcoin is in exactly that: a neutral, global protocol. So any company that wants to, can build whatever they want on top of it, and charge whatever fee or premium they want (mostly determined by lawmakers, not just the bankers themselves). Anyone who doesn't want to pay those fees (or doesn't have access to the products), can interact directly with the Bitcoin protocol.  
GS demanding a premium does in no way whatsoever detracts from billions of people interacting with Bitcoin. So your initial comment about the "ethos of Bitcoin" is nonsense.

1. Satoshi is said to own 1 million BTC. That's definitely an absurd amount, too. Afaik, Vitalik held 500k ETH at one point.   
2. Similar to BTC's inflation? 3-4% iirc  
3. Possibly.  
4. [Same for Bitcoin](  
5 &amp; 6 are subjective. What projects are you talking about? Don't forget, and even Ammous amits this, that Bitcoin's structure ensures that big central entities will be built, whereas Ethereum has to potential to do it on-chain. Think futures (Bitmex vs dydx), stablecoins, ..

Many of my friend have never heard of ETF, because you would use them in regular investment vehicles. You can’t choose etfs in your pension fund, for example, and legacy banking has a very high incentive to sell their own funds.

That's.. a bad argument. It's "free" to fork Bitcoin, too, but that doesn't explain why BCH or BSV (or whatever they call it nowadays) has more value than Bitcoin Gold or Diamond or whatever.  
I'd argue that those ERC20 token thingies are experimenting in areas where Bitcoin cannot (yet) go. Makerdao is a good example. There is no way to build that on top of Bitcoin today, but in the last What Bitcoin Did episode, the guest talked about building something like MakerDAO on top of LN.
