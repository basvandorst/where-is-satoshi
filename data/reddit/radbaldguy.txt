New account. First post. No proof. Directly asking elsewhere in the thread for charity to help bail him out from a ridiculously poor investment decision (that probably did not really happen)... Sounds like a scam to me.
Edit: as pointed out below, its not a new account, I saw it was his first submission and made an incorrect assumption. I remain skeptical, though.

Ha! Sorry. On mobile, saw it was the first and only post, incorrectly assumed it was a new account. Nevertheless, I remain skeptical and dislike people asking to be bailed out from poor investment decisions.

They're not paying interest, per se. Rather, you receive a portion if the exchange fees generated by trades. It is fixed to that revenue, so less fees generated means less "interest" paid out.

I would also suggest as a corollary that the lawyer should be able to give feedback regarding the amount if a question isn't being answered because the offered price is too low... For example, if a question isn't being answered because it would take a couple hours of research, it would be helpful for the lawyer to give a sort of bid, like "I'd answer this for .5 BTC."

I must have missed this post... wish I'd seen it before I fell into the same pit.  They should at least let their customers know when they change a policy like this... I verified my account AGAIN, but now I'm left with a week to wait for my new coins. Come on Coinbase, this is absurd.

As a law talkin' guy, I am interested. I have considered offering to accept bitcoin as payment in the past and this could be a good segue. I have a few questions: (1) What sort of guarantees do participants have re. anononymity? (2) What type of data do you track and keep about users? (3) Have you discussed any of the jurisdictional/ethical/unauthorized practice of law issues with a real lawyer? These are real concerns and if you want real lawyers to participate, you'll need to address them, likely with appropriate waivers and disclaimers.

I loved the last line:  "Well, at least until the climate collapses and oil runs out and everything dies."  I always appreciate a good mix of sarcasm and realism... there's probably a better word to describe it, but I'm not smart enough to know it.

It surprises me how few people seem to understand this point.

I have [this one installed]( (there's currently a free version, I paid $.99).  It works fine, but only supports getwork, not stratum.  As others have said, it would be unwise to use it long term and it will never earn enough to even pay for the $.99 of buying it.  With that said, it does mine and I used it as a noob a few months ago to learn about how mining works... for that, it's great.  Do your homework about mining before you get in though, ROI is unlikely for most people just getting into it now.  See [

How does one hedge an investment in bitcoin, as is suggested in the article?
