Why the fuck would you keep daily operating capital in an exchange?

Yeah your humor is getting in the way of the incessant bitcoin price posts. Speaking of which $258.499999899!!!!!1!1!!one

But they've got to fabricate something special about it or their preorderers will feel like the marks they always were!

Yeah I get it, I forget this is a stock news website to some. Any news is news when it relates to your favorite investment.

Well that's not true... At current btc value even if you're paying a pretty high price per kilowatt hour a single video card could still net you a very small profit as long as it wasn't too much less efficient than 0.7MH/s/W. Of course this is also assuming you bought it for gaming and didn't consider a return on your video card like most hobbyists.

You don't think the people who made bitcoin what it is today would drop out if they felt like it wasn't theirs anymore? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:38:33
How about a mBTC?

Basically you go one of two ways, paranoid as fuck means you make a cold wallet and stuff it in your closet, normal person means you keep doing what you're doing knowing there's less than a 0.00001% chance a hacker this intelligent will target your measly wallet. If your 'storage computer' is strictly used for just that, you're very very safe. Start fucking around on it and it becomes less safe. There ya go.

Bullshit I've been tuning cgminer for weeks and only have about 5 hash marks. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:42:38
Are you trying to get some sort of bullshit 'invention by proxy' rights!? I remember asimov tackling something similar to this issue in one of his short stories. It was about some woman cashing in on the pieces her robot artist made. Fuck I can't think of the title!

No he unplugged the speaker and microphone, that's enough. But yeah the idea he can afford 15 computers to infect with this shit but no high frequency recording equipment... a little odd.

I really doubt he was saying "WHOAAA, BRO" about the pet rock unless he was high as fuck.

I need to run a program on the receiving computer as well, otherwise this is difficult/impossible to implement.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:00:54
Wow that article was really shitty, why the popularity? Oh right, it featured bitcoin as the subject. Welcome to r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:57:54
Satoshi Nakamotos the *devil*! 
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:31:19
More like cosponsored the ENTIRE INTERNET, eh, eh? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:47:00
So... Bitcoin mixer first? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:45:41
Yeah that seems to imply a whole shit load of testing went on, probably for a while. I'm liking that venture capitalist's hypothesis that a government created it more and more. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:06:57
From the get go the company has seemed like 95% shady marketers and 5% engineers, can't say this is surprising. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:48:07
I'd say a team of shadowy software engineers could certainly fool people into thinking that they were collectively one top tier programmer.
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:00:31
Like the article said... a lot of people can do this. Do you know how long we've been encoding information in different frequency bands? Shit I'll do it, what sort of bounty are you putting up?
Edit: Are we talking bios level, cause that would suck depending on your chip, or more quickly I'm thinking proof for bounty you unplug both of your windows/linux/idon'tgiveashit computers and you run my executable from the first one and the second one writes the string you pass my executable to a text file on the second computer.

It's definitely concerning that the number of hardware manufacturers has steadily been shrinking to the point where this may be true in 5-10 years.
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:05:05
;) 
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:40:31
So what's the delivery? Speaker to microphone exact duplicate of input data of finite length in any amount of time? Separate computers? Give me some specific pass/no pass tests home nugget.

would be wonderful, I'd start it, but I lack the dedication these fanboys have for trawling every corner of the internet for arbitrary mentions of bitcoin. Guess I have no right to demand better content haha
