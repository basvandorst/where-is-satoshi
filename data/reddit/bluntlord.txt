i do! i'm yet to lose a single cent. thanks for asking. 
i hope you enjoy your next shift at Mcdonalds. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:44:49
no, that's not me. 
not nearly enough salt in that picture. try again.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:17:54
most of them probably don't know i care. 
If you read the post, i clearly say none of this was directly aimed at me. it's just a hot topic for conversation today. 


the day i brag to my coworkers about my crypto profits is the day i quit my job because of my crypto profits :) so in other words, no time in the near future! haha 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:06:56


THAT'S THE PART I HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH!!!
it's like a blind guy correctly guessing the color of something. yea ok, you guessed it, fair play. but if he were to turn around and say "yea, i knew all along that's what color it was, it was so obvious. ALL signs point to that car being green, i can smell it. there was no way in hell i ever would have got that wrong" it just really grinds my gears...idk why. 


i haven't lost anything, which makes it more confusing. i should be happy. 


that's a cool thought. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:37:16
That is correct. which is why that statement still confuses me haha

Right...except i never bragged about it or pressured anyone into doing anything. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:57:44
because people have already made up their mind that i go around bragging about bitcoin all day, anything that goes against that is downvoted :P

thanks, xxIcePoseidonFanBoy69xx
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:15:22
thank you, that's exactly it haha none of this "i told you so" is being aimed directly at me or any other individual. it's all just general chatter around the office. if people ask i'll answer but i'm not jumping out from behind the water cooler like "YO, HEARD ABOUT BITCOIN?! WHY NOT?! BUY NOW! I'VE MADE TRILLIONS!"
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:48
There's a very small group of us who occasionally talk about it, no one reveals how much or what they hold, we just like to talk about crypto in general.
That + the recent price action and media coverage has piqued the interest of several people close by. Some want to learn more, some just want to feel included, others just want a chance to let people know they think it's stupid. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:19:24
haha i know a few people who want it for that reason too! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:52:53

@_date: 2018-01-17 03:22:16


MS only took it down for like a day. but other than that, i agree with a lot of what you say. 


now THAT is a "told ya so" i'm ok with. something that actually makes sense. not just "well yea i made a prediction that it would crash based on nothing other than the fact i don't understand it or own it. god damn i'm smart"

@_date: 2018-01-17 01:51:20
depends on what context they were given i guess. 
"hey invest in this, you'll get a %10000 return in a year guaranteed!"
is a lot different to 
"hey, i've invested in this, if you've got spare cash you should too. it will either go up 10x or plummet to nothing, who the fuck knows, it's all a gamble"
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:33:59
thanks for taking it exactly the way it was meant to be taken. 
just a pointless, senseless rant for the sake of ranting.

@_date: 2018-01-16 22:26:52
You're god damn right i'm salty! 
losing money? shit happens. being wrong? part of life. 
but there's just something about the "i have no idea what i'm talking about i just flipped a coin, picked a side and i was right. look at how smart i am" that really pisses me off regardless of the subject.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:47:45
bitcoin is only worth 10k now. nice investment in a dead imaginary coin, idiot! /s

i'm sorry that people making your yearly wage in a week by doing absolutely nothing is "moronic" 
I guess that's what they deserve for not being as smart you :(
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:49:09
I saw you post to yesterday around this time. I'm guessing they heavily recommended Bitcoin Cash instead.
I'm not going to tell you what to do or not to do with your money...just...do some research outside of reddit. 
Don't drink the kool-Aid
Otherwise, Good call on getting your BTC off of the exchange! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:28:59


this. but that doesn't stop near by people from overhearing the conversation and adding their 2 cents in. it's also been plastered all over the news recently if you haven't noticed so even if they want nothing to do with it, they are hearing about it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:29:34
hahaha ok yea, sorry. wrong word.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:59:00
Not a single cent :) 
not exactly a "shitty" bitcoin situation either, remember they are still worth 10k (i think) each...
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:52:02
by "point them in the right direction" i mean, how exchanges work, wallets, seed words, other coins, how to not get scammed. that kind of shit. 
what to buy/sell and when to buy/sell? it's not my money, they can figure that out for themselves :) 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:53:07
I can buy lambos and KFC with it. 
That is the important part, obviously!

yea ok. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS is considered dead.

@_date: 2018-01-17 10:07:08
 fair enough. And I agree on the money isn't everything statement and the rest off it, but money isn't the thing that pissed me off.  It wasn't even directly related to bitcoin. 
As for the forcing people into conversations. Of the 80+ people, I've maybe talked to 10. Ever. About anything. 4 or 5 of those, I actually talk to about something other than work. And no those are not the people in the story haha.
For whatever reason,  I decided to rant about it on reddit. Some people got a kick out of it,  others read way too far into it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:25


as for boasting? nope. i'm more than happy to talk about bitcoin with anyone, but i avoid talking about price and don't answer the "what should i invest in" and it's not exactly like i display my bitcoin balance on a giant sign above my desk haha 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:39:15
how can i take the L when i haven't lost anything?

still quite comfortably in the profit zone, thanks! :) 
good news for you! this is a great chance to get some discounted bitcoin so you don't have to walk through life being salty that you missed out! :3
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:03:03
where are people getting the idea that i've lost a bunch of money? hahaha it still hasn't even dropped below 10k! &lt;3 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:30
i could still cash out right now and take some very tidy profits away, not sure where grief comes in to it! :P

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:20:14

I respect a man who goes all in at the first opportunity. That's a power play. 
Throwing in all 40k that could be used elsewhere? No bueno. 
Investing 5k you won't miss and HODL? Not the worst idea,  btc still has room to grow.  But don't let reddit make the decision :p
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:07:15
wait, why can't mining be done anymore without hella funds  and a warehouse to back it up? is buying a single antminer S9 not going to be profitable?
i have no intent on doing this now or ever, i just remember a friend bring it up a while ago and saying it worked out to be a pretty nice profit. (he was using this or something similar 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:44:50

i was comparing it to NZD, it was 20k NZD at the time of writing that...nearly 21k now. 
although the NZ market for BTC moves soooooo slow, so prices are always a little off one way or another. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:28:12
sorry for having fun :( 


maybe i'm wrong, but i don't think anyone is running on the assumption that btc will never go down in price again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:30:53


that actually makes me so fucking happy :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:28:25

i bought just after 9k, so i'm no early adopter. but My friends/family did nothing but tell me how fucking stupid i was for "wasting" 9k USD on "fake money".

i mean seems to be an issue now more than ever, and with all the publicity btc is getting lately it couldn't hurt, right? but there is obviously a reason why it hasn't happend, which is where i'm confused.

i'm sweating a little.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:58:29
actually not a bad idea. Escorts could start accepting bitcoin as payment.No more going to an ATM, fumbling around with cash. they could just have QR code tramp-stamp stickers, that way you could make both deposits at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:36:03
had a good chunk of money to invest in something, started looking into bitcoin. Initially was drawn to the idea of one day cashing out for a profit, but the more i learn about bitcoin the more i like the idea of not having to trade it for fiat at all. 
yea, i started buying in late (just after 9k mark) so i'm not ever going to see the returns that a lot of you are. but if Bitcoin grows into a widely adopted, every-day use crypto currency i'll be glad that i own at least 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:26:41
nice try :P
