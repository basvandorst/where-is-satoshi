What about the fact that it's possible to deal with tiny fractions of Bitcoin? Instead of dropping a gold bar, you can drop a gold coin!

Your explanation is great. Thanks!

I'm not doubting you, but can you explain (maybe with a source or something) what will make Bitcoin more efficient? I'm a beginner, and I would like some hope since I'm not 100% happy with ridiculous transfer fees and what-not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:55:02
I expect more from you !

I think what a lot of people in this sub don't want you to know is that there are better, faster cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin. I'm learning that myself (I'm new to cryptocurrencies).
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:01:24
I've asked this before. This sub is scared of giving a straight answer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:24:53
Or you can buy a bike and just ride the Bitcoin all the way to the moon.

Lol I just made a post that is accidentally strikingly similar to yours. I guess I'll leave it unless it pisses people off.
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:44:33
Oh, well screw it then. I'm happy to have any at all, just to be part of it!
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:45:08
Lol you're stone cold. I like.

I mean, honestly, a Tesla is my dream car. I just hated the circlejerking.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:22:34
I'm new to Bitcoin, not reddit!

I have .00994 and I'm sitting here pissed that I'd have to spend $1 fee on Coinbase to get that extra 6/100,000 of a Bitcoin! I basically want to just stop at .01 Bitcoins, because I ain't got no job  to keep investing. Any way around the fee for such a small amount?
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:13:42
Ah, I see.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:24:12
Yes, in most of the US. Just not what they grow into...
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:33:59
Yeah, it doesn't make sense to call it parabolic lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:40:08
So, the BTC in my wallet won't be affected? Is there anything I should do with it?
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:03:24
I was going to say give me $8000 worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:38:55
Ah, I see. I'm kind of new here, so I was just surprised at how much circlejerking there was about Lambos. I thought it was legit!
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:44:27
I recently bought spores of a particular type of mushroom using Bitcoin. No ragrets.
