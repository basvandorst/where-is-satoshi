Just released Zenbot 3. Discussion [over on the new thread]( thanks!

It uses minimal resources when just tracking/trading, but when backfilling historical data I recommend at least 2GB ram.
If you want the cheapest route, backfill the historical data on your desktop using the cli, move the mongo db to a t2.micro server, run it without the --backfill flag.

this is the live BTC/USD graph as fed from GDAX, with MACD and RSI indicators. If you have the secret URL to the server, you also get overlays of trade arrows as they get executed.

The first engine I built used up-to-date data in the simulation, but when comparing the sim results of one machine to another, the inputs were different, so the ROI's couldn't be reliably compared. This is important for parallel/distributed processing.
At some point I'd like to set up a sharing mechanism for strategies, so one installation of zenbot could say "here's my strategy given this input hash, produces this ROI", so the longer the input hash stays the same (1 week seems reasonable to me), the ROI can be improved using the same inputs, until the hash expires.

zenbot master branch now uses 1h RSI, so I recommend just dropping your zenbrain db, re-running ./run.sh until trade backfill finishes, and after that RSI will be backfilled, and you should have a complete set of RSI values for the trader to use. You'll see "marked x ticks for RSI backfill".

it expect generic trading support by version 2.7, maybe 2.6. I will work on it over the weekend! Please comment in the github issue queue if you'd like to contribute!

try `./zenbot sim --verbose` to get the full console output, it might be that your RSI needs backfilling (which you can trigger by restarting `./run.sh`) or the trade conditions aren't being met.

yes, I'm currently working on multi-pair support in 3.x

hmm... never experienced that before. I always use tcp4, lol

Update. Zenbot 3 has just been released! A new [Reddit thread]( is on for 3.x related discussion.
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:03:12
not yet implemented. fees vary quite a bit between exchanges (and sometimes the amount of volume you trade) so I need to work out a way for exchange plugins to handle the fee calculation.

please update to 3.1.x if you haven't, I just released some major logic updates. safe to drop your old zenbrain DB before that update, the backfill will restart with some new reduction parameters.
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:18:29
I will add support for other exchanges if there's enough demand. it wouldn't be technically difficult but each exchange has its own volume, which means each exchange needs to be machine-learned separately.
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:27:38
the logic is pretty open-ended. briefly:
- ticks are in 10s increments
- each tick is categorized as "buy" or "sell" based on if the trades consisted mostly of buying or selling (this is called the "taker" side, the opposite side of "maker" which was on the books)
- buying increments the **volume counter** in the positive direction, selling in the negative. each side is independently weighted (machine learned), allowing the bot to be "bullish" or "bearish".
- a **small decay** factor (machine-learned) is applied to the counter to weight recent events higher
- when the volume in one direction reaches a **trigger value** (machine learned), the bot gets ready to trade. for example, if `sell_volume - buy_volume &gt; 750`, trigger to sell. amount to trade out of available balance is machine-learned.
- the volume counter is then **reset** at 0 and the cycle repeats
as you can see, zenbot completely ignores price. it also ignores volume that is cancelled out by the other side, for example a day-trader selling 20BTC and then buying it back immediately, to bait price swings. it does this under the belief that price is mostly an illusion, a result of directly preceding events, and those patterns tend to repeat, signalled by volume changes. thus, all params are based on historical analysis (typically the last 3 months of data) of volume, not price.
**TLDR**; so basically it filters out market noise, determines the best action from the traders themselves, and benefits by being among the first to detect these trends.
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:05:58
also, there is a "zen market index" generated. Right now it's at `36/750 BULL`, which means zen is 4% the way to buying. since this index has a decay applied, it's weighted to recent events and gives a decent at-a-glance mood of the system. you can check the live ZMI at

it's brand new. wrote it from scratch in the last week. disclaimer, it's evolving pretty quickly and may break between minor versions.
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:50:06
the learner can run constantly in the background, and new data flows into the simulation every week on wednesday. also you can hook up several learner machines each running parallel sims, and report to the central trading bot, and hot-reload params into memory. so far a i have 3 machines learning and all 3 of them have improved the ROI in some way.

There is a general lack of open source bots, especially ones with AI. Since I learned how to code by reverse engineering, I'm saying thanks to Satoshi, Torvalds, djb, et. al for devoting their lives to open source. It might be against my "selfish interest" but in the end it's best for everyone. Also, I still own the copyright and will re-write it from scratch to be better, if the algorithm proves successful and I want to take it to the next level.

if git is hanging up, try the releases page:

sound advice. as with buying bitcoin in general, risk is involved and caution is essential. bitcoin is an experiment, and so is zenbot.

hi, glad you're interested! here's where the [mutations]( happen, the fitness score is equal to the ROI for now, and if fitness is higher than prev. recorded, [it becomes]( the new standard which is used for subsequent sims.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:51:08
1. I have seen losses in the simulator, so it's possible. It only takes a few hours of machine learning to gain a comfortable (albeit virtual) profit margin though. If the bot starts losing money, you can always step in and manual trade or shut the bot down to prevent more loss.
2. i'm not sure what you mean by "close a trade" but it always trades with the "market" flag, i.e. the order never goes on the books, and the trade goes through with whatever price the last system trade was at. this way, zenbot never needs to cancel orders or compare prices.
3. it means the bot tried to buy BTC, but had not enough USD balance to do that. the volume counter resets anyway. if you feel comfortable investing, you can deposit USD in your GDAX account and zenbot will use that the next time the volume counter triggers.
