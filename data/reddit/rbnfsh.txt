Are there apps that do this for you - so you take a pic of the qr and it asks for an amount and you click send.

Not bitching - you tool - I tried to set up accounts on three platforms, tried different techniques from credit card to bank deposit - spend an hour trying to buy coins - and then come to a forum filled with bitcoin ambassadors for some help and to ask advice on how best to do this - thanks for your help. All I want is the easiest way to anonymously buy bitcoins.

So I tried to paste my QR code here - it looks rubbish in chrome on MAC. Works on firefox.

How do you pay people when they use their QR code - is there an app - I see loads of people using it as an avatar or something similar. Like this for example:
