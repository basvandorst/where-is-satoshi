Thanks for the link. Looks like they're mostly closed or about to close. I'll probably go tomorrow

Sorry, could you explain this to me? I'm not too knowledgeable with the jargon.

How is voluntary collective assembly of workers cooperatives a powerful and oppressive dictatorship exactly? Have you even ever read anything of his? He's fiercely anti authoritarian and many communists despise him because he often talks about the repression within the Soviet Union and uses it as a measuring stick against oppression in the West. He's against the police as a concept, thinks that all authority should be questioned (not just states) and has said repeatedly that if you have to use aggressive violence to accomplish your objective, you've already failed and that grass roots movements are the way to make great changes within society. He's against laws that prohibit personal freedoms (i.e drug laws) and he believes any institution (including government) should be dissolved if it fails to justify its own existence. Nothing you said applies to him, even if you disagree with his views.

You're just spewing ideology now. Workers cooperatives already exist all over the world... including in capitalist countries. None of them have been achieved through violent revolution. The most famous one was founded by college students in Spain and today has thousands of workers who voluntarily work as part of the cooperative. Actually read up on what exists and how they came to be formed before accusing me of white-washing the ideology, because clearly you don't know what that Ideology is. Marxist-Leninism is NOT the same as Anarchism, they call for radically different tactics and are often in conflict with each other. Again, you're just making broad generalized statements without any actual point and it's clear you've not read anything on the subject but feel confident acting like you have. I can't argue with someone like that so, have a nice day and if you get around to it, try actually reading up on the what these different political philosophies mean and then you'll be better served.
