I think another way to look at it is "growing pains". I can't think of anything "new" that doesn't go through this sort of process of back and forth backlashes until some sort of balance is attained.

You'd be correct, if you had an actual argument, and weren't the actual abuser. You don't (it's not in any of your actual replys -- making this an easy assertion on my part), and you are, because everything you've said is ad-hominem. So my statement can be concidered fairly accurate without any of the concerns you are trying to raise... in vain.

Either you're deliberetly thick skulled or you have an agenda. Connecting the basic dots is up to you. Just because you can't doesn't mean there isn't a connection, just that you're short sighted (and vocal about it too, to boon).

Got more knee-jerks in there? let them all out now so we can promptly ignore you too.

Please continue the ad-hominem, and please bless us with your unsurpassed knowledge in... what is it again?

Why are you deliberately derailing the subject? What is your motivation in spreading misinformation? Why do you hate your mother?

Obvious troll is obvious.

Your assertion that it is "useless" needs more explanation, especially that the usefullness is thouroughly explained in the link provided. What makes it "useless" other than your own personal perspective/preference/ignorance/agenda?
