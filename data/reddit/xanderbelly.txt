How about a different kind of tipping game? Like a ChangeTip Challenge. You send a person $5 and challenge them to add to it, and send it along to someone else. The eventual goal would be to donate to a worthy cause, by sending back to the originator after a specified threshold.

Id like to see a iOS wallet that limits the amount it can store to $100 or so. So if your print is lifted and your phone stolen no big loss.  But anyway i am sure that the iPhone6 wont allow you to unlock by touch if it is more than 3 meters away from the upcoming iWatch.
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:33:10
this. GLD took a while to get going ten years ago; this will be similar. I have a feeling the SEC is playing a waiting game. If BTC doesn't implode by itself in the next 6 months this might have a chance of being approved. The Winklevii have the right people representing them, who know when to push and when to hold back. In any negotiation pushing too hard kills the deal. This is a very sensitive time requiring an almost zen-like period of patience and restraint.

Here's the thing: Bitcoin don't care, it just survives. When a friend emailed me about Mt. Gox, I emailed back with a compilation of headlines over the previous 18 months of Bitcoin's "collapse". Bitcoin collapsing is about as predictable as Ol' Faithful. Problem is; it doesn't collapse. It hangs around, it just won't die. And people don't understand that. When they keep hearing it pop up in the media every couple months, their thinking will change. But it takes time. Every day that Bitcoin is not worth 0 is another day of trust building with the general public.

I was the one who asked Peter about this at the Chicago conference. I get their philosophy about being worldwide, but if China says you can't use it to pay for things, and Russia bans it outright, I don't understand the hesitation on their part to simply uncheck those countries in their app distribution settings, get approved, and call it a day. They have said "stay tuned" so maybe something else entirely is happening. I believe BTC future is in phone wallets, and native UX is generally better, which is why i have an interest in this.

This is based on old pricing from mid 2013 when originally filed. It looks like it will be 1,000,000 shares as you state, with each share being .2 of a BTC, thus 200,000 BTC will be the starting point for the Trust. The WinkDex price will likely determine the offering price when it goes live.

It most likely costs more than 600 USD to mine a single bitcoin today. Miners will hodl, creating scarcity, until the coins are profitable to sell. Also off blockchain, centralized transaction clearinghouses are the future for high velocity payments. Bitcoin is the backbone.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:48:00
hmm, so maybe possible. I wonder how much a bunch of small ACH transactions cost, i.e. Is it viable to ACH .50 usd for something small? Or would coinbase reject this due to minimum buy amounts. Maybe hooking it up to a credit card ala Circle would be better than ach. Maybe when Circle is all rolled out they can implement something like this.

Yup, Bitgold was more complex than Bitcoin. Each Bitgold unit was to be market priced based on the computing power used to create it. Baskets of differing value Bitgold units from different difficulty periods would then be created by intermediary bank-like institutions which would issue consistently valued Bitgold currency units.
If he actually created Bitcoin, he would have had to make a decision to pitch all of that and just hope the "all differing period bit units would become fungibally equal" worked in the market. Which it appears is working rather well. I don't see current Bitcoins costing hundreds of dollars more electricity than ones mined in 2012 going for a higher market price. Likewise, I don't see a collectible market developing for people desiring early generation Bitcoins as he had expected.

A viable digital currency has been sought after since the 80s. It's no wonder he thought it was a "they". I was trying to scheme up a digital currency for micro payments as early as 1995, because at that time, everybody knew it was going to be the wave of the future. Even so, I ignored bitcoin until seven months ago. So many others failed in the space, people don't know how bitcoin is any different.

Even before that point, we are now in a consolidation phase where the hardware is being commoditized to the point that electricity cost is the gating factor. The less efficient (hardware wise and geographic wise) miners are being squeezed out of the market, making Bitcoin mining greener all the time, at the theoretical security risk of centralizing a decentralized system.
The ultimate destination of an ever increasing difficulty is a few gigantic mines scattered across the planet, being fed by cost-free electricity, supplied by either solar/wind/hydro renewables (yeah!) or government-subsidised coal/nuclear/natgas fired plants (boo!).

Apple put in a separate, secured chip to hold the fingerprint data in the latest iPhone 5s. Perhaps they are developing something similar for crypto?

They are not going to risk that unless they have some compelling security around it.

Not enthralling, but interesting nonetheless.
Capital controls are being applied to Bitcoin in China. This means that when the exchanges are back to "normal" the spot price of BTC will likely move higher in China vis a vis ROW, likely permanently, due to lack of legal arbitrage possibilities.
Demand for coins in China reduces supply for the rest of us, indirectly driving upward price pressure on non-China prices over time. Chinese BTC becomes a "virtual" capital flight vehicle since the direct route of BTC withdrawals to unidentified addresses may be closed down or severely restricted.

I suspect that every time there is bad news or a death knell for Bitcoin, the SEC just sits on it for awhile. It will take a few more rounds of learning "oh, it seems Bitcoin doesn't ever die" before they move on it.
Also Barry's conversion of GBTC to a true ETF will be the kick in the pants it needs. You can bet if this gets traction Moriarty will be pushing the SEC to approve COIN.

By buying into the ETF you are outsourcing your wallet security to the ETF for a fee. Whether this is good or bad depends on your individual situation / preference. Also in the US you are able to use retirement funds in IRA or 401K accounts, which accrue any gains tax-deferred or tax-free.
If Bitcoin is really a long term investment (which is looking more and more like it by the day) then people will want to invest a portion of their retirement savings (of which there is a very large pool) into it via these methods. It would be as easy as buying any other stock to hold in a diversified portfolio.
A tiny portion of retirement funds flowing into the ETF would eventually deplete the initial offering and the AP's would arb by buying/selling on the exchanges. It will likely bring more volatility to the price, but mostly on the upside in the beginning as short options on the ETF would not be well established at the start.
Some of the excitement comes from the history of the GLD ETF which launched a decade ago. Since Bitcoin is similar to physical Gold, people are banking on COIN having a similar initial success in the ETF. In November of 2004 the GLD ETF launched and achieved $1 Billion in assets after only three days.
A similar opening for COIN might see the initial 200,000 coins bought up quickly (at $300 / BTC this would take $60 million) and then the rest of the demand trickling down through to the exchanges via arbitrage by the AP's.
As a side note, if you read anything that says the offering price is $20 per share you can ignore the whole article; it is either ignorant or FUD or otherwise. $20 per share equates to $100 / BTC which we are not even close to nearing even in this extended bear market. BTC was $100 when the initial filing was created, this is just a placeholder number. The actual offering price will be updated based on the WinkDex BTC value near the date of the offering availability (The WinkDex was created solely for this purpose). If they really priced it at $20 per share the twins would be leaving alot of money on the table for the AP's.

If the SEC approves Winky COIN, this is true. However it has been sitting in limbo at the SEC for 3 years and The Halvening is here now. SEC approval is no longer worth waiting for, thus now it will be a black swan in terms of GBTC if it happens at all.
@_date: 2016-06-07 14:48:36
Right, there is a deep pool of IRA money that wants to get exposure to BTC, GBTC is the easiest way in the US to do this, and these retirement accounts necessarily have long time frames.

When the PC first came out, there were few non-technical uses beyond the curiosity factor. The go-to sales pitch to the non-technical user was always "your wife can keep her recipes on it!"
Forget that the PC UX at that time was miserable and nobody wanted to look at a tiny green screen in their kitchen while baking.
Few people in the late seventies, early eighties realized that the vast power of computing was not in ever faster calculating ability, but in the human to human communications it enabled through networks of PC's.
Everyone could feel that PC's and digitization of everything was inevitable, but not many realized why it would be so much better that way.
Turns out digitization of analog media (1980's version of 'software is eating the world') allowed it to be shared with much less friction when paired with computerized networks. This was the killer app. Human to human sharing of content, through a digital medium.
In a similar vein it seems few can see the promise of this initial stab at a micropayments processing server. The ideas floated include the old saws of spam-reduction via fees, selling API accesses per millicent minute, and creating your own digital media and selling it into a digital marketplace like a decentralized eBay.
Perhaps some of these will take hold, perhaps not.
But just like the early 80's, there is a vast dark matter ahead of us that we can palpate the power of, but cannot yet coherently grasp.
The target of the IoT micropayments infrastructure will likely be anything that is currently a friction point in transaction processing, relatedly any transaction series with with a low cadence.
All technological advances serve to reduce friction and thus increase cadence, simply apply these concepts to monetary transactions.
A textual communication went from weeks via the Pony Express to days via rail to hours via air to minutes via email to seconds via IM. Instead of one letter a year from a distant cousin you may now have a daily discourse over IM. The friction of transactions lessened allowing the frequency to increase.
It is obvious that cryptocurrency technology can markedly increase settlement times of large transactions that currently take days.
Where else can this be applied, at a more personal level?
Any transaction that occurs at a personal settlement layer, bundling up mini-transactions over a fixed time period, can in future be unbundled, as the cost (friction) of billing daily or hourly or minutely usage reduces to near zero.
Forget about your fridge ordering a gallon of milk when you are almost out. Think of all these aggregated payments:
Car payment
Homeowners insurance
Home equity loan
Condo association dues
Club dues
School tuition
OTOH, how about this:
Each side of the above transactions would be better served to be a stream of daily or hourly payments instead of a monthly / semi-annual / annual bundle payment. The payor can better budget and avoid overdrafts and the payee has more predictable income flows.
Of course this is not too exciting, just turning bills into streams. But do you think it will be a thing? Cause if it will be, it will need a brand new infrastructure to support it. The current one certainly won't. And it will be big, really big.

The tellers dont transfer to eachother, each of the 4 transactions involved is a person to person virtual currency transfer which is not subject to AML / KYC. Nobody is a custodian of anybody elses money here. A small distinction that makes this solution pretty brilliant.

I think within the year there will be plenty of additional  Howellstash entering the market.

If you buy btc from localbitcoins, then send that btc to someone in Mexico, are you an MSB? If the recipient in Mexico trades their btc for cash via localbitcoins, are they? No, you are all acting on your own behalf and not moving other peoples money. That is what is effectively happening here.

I can neither confirm nor deny this.

The most *obvious* reason for this supposed "anomoly" is that reality itself is in the process of coming to consensus. One fork is where Craig Wright is Satoshi, one fork where he is not. We don't have enough confirmations yet to determine which will be the proper one.
This has much in common with the "Berenste(a)in Bears Universe Theory" because it points to the same underlying truth. Reality is not factual, it was decided by Einstein initially and the Copenhagen Interpretation of 1927 that objective reality does not, in fact, exist. It is all individual perception in a shared matrix where unconscious belief systems only allow a viewer to decode reality according to their pre-conceived notions.
To us, the cryptographic "proof" seems senseless and unbelievable, because it is. To *us*. It has to, otherwise the wave function would be collapsed instantly universally, which it cannot. At a subatomic level wave functions collapse, on the larger scale of our societal shared reality a consensus mechanism much like POW is used, and this uses (or manifests) as the passage of time.
To the others, the cryptographic proof is, right now, *actual* proof that Wright is Satoshi, *in their Universe*. If we inhabited their Universe B instead of our Universe A, we would see the cryptographic proof as valid. We have a fork of reality at this moment, and we are not sure which timechain will win.
Cryptographic proof is proof beyond a doubt, and this cannot exist in our Universe of subjectivity, because then the decisions would be out of our hands. This event is peeling back the curtain, showing us a window into the workings of our own reality; this is the power of POW and the Bitcoin blockchain.
We have literally created the "dent in the Universe" that Apple's Steve Jobs so figuratively spoke of.
Where we go from here, is a choice I leave to you.

I have, my book got about as much traction as this post so far. Maybe my Universe is on an orphaned chain *sadtrombone*

Just? I'm old. :) I've been reading all that crap for decades.
But they never wrote any plotline where a reversed engineered UFO with quantum computing capability stolen from the government was used to overcome a malicious attack by nefarious shadow government operators where Bitcoin difficulty was purposely stuck so as to benefit from shorting the price of Bitcoin.
So I got that going for me.

Have read Snow Crash, Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon, missed that one I'll have to check it out thx

Nobody is moving money on behalf of someone else with this solution. There are only person to person transactions.

My interpretation of Copenhagen is the agreement that there is no ultimate "particle" that underlies everything.
Beyond a certain point it is unknowable until observed. The whole wave/particle duality, the double-slit experiment, observed requires observer to co-create.
How can these concepts lose favor? Are we going backwards?

The tellers dont transfer to eachother, otherwise they would be considered MSB's. They only deal with the sender/receiver who submit trans to the blockchain directly. Person to person virtual currency transfers are not subject to AML / KYC.

Emails were released between Finney and Satoshi regarding some early bugs. Headers and all. Seem legit, I dont believe Hal was Satoshi or on team Satoshi.

What a great trip down memory lane. Well over 35 here and remember refreshing CNet homepage dozens of times daily.  Getting excited for a postage stamp streaming video over 56k. (In the future we will watch shows like this but full screen!) First on the block with cable modem. Also first on the block to be able to browse all my neighbors hard drives. (thanks Windows for Workgroups and NetBIOS/NetBUI!)
