Cool thanks! I'll give that a try in a little bit.

I'm trying to run a full node but it's not going so well for me.  Tried finding a dummies guide to running a node on my 18Tb FreeNAS server but none exists and I don't understand the Linux mumbo jumbo to manually configure it.  So I installed BitcoinQT on my Windows 8.1 PC and let it sync up. I can only get 8 connections even though I opened port 8333 in my router. I use Private Internet Access VPN on my Windows machine so maybe that does something to limit connections?

Is there a way to run a node in the background of Xbmcbuntu/Kodibuntu? The Raspberry Pi would be connected to my router which my server is connected also.

I just switched to that method last week. I had set Coinbase to buy .1btc each week but now I set it to auto buy $50 of btc each week. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:52:34
I didnt know there was a white paper until that survey last week asked if i had read the white paper. I've been buying small amounts of bitcoin since mid-December 2013.

Hey any long distance plans to expand to South America? I've been keeping hope for a trustworthy exchange to operate in Peru so I can send money from USA to family cheaper than Western Union. Keep on keeping on!

Tried setting up a node this weekend using this site but the instructions are incomplete and I was unable to get it working. There are a few things not mentioned that need to be installed such as libtool, automake, autoconf, and possibly others. For anyone with near 0 experience with Linux/debian/Ubuntu like me trying to setup a node following the guide on raspnode.com will give you problems and errors.

The Bitcoin you sent are held in escrow by Purse. Once your item physically is delivered you confirm the delivery in Purse and your sent bitcoins will be paid to the seller.

I can browse the files just fine when I open the icon on the desktop and when I restart bitcoin core it starts to download to it. But I'm trying to get it to do this automatically on startup so if theres a power outage or something when the Pi boots back up it just does its thing without me having to do anything to it.

Running Lubuntu 16.04 32bit on my Raspberry Pi 2. I have connected to it through powered USB an external 500gb HDD which I want to use as the data directory. Lubuntu and everything is up to date and I have sucessfully installed and run Bitcoin Core 13.2. On first startup of Bitcoin Core it asked where to put the data directory. I pointed it to Bitcoin folder on the root of the HDD i created. Bitcoin Core starts up and starts downloading the blockchain. On reboot of my Raspberry Pi, Bitcoin Core will start but then it gives me the error message in the picture even though I have not changed any settings and the drive is near empty. How can I use an external HDD with Bitcoin Core using Ubuntu (I've tried setting it up headless in raspbian but I like GUIs more).
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:02:20
The point is is that there is no mention in the Raspnode guide that these packages need to be installed. I copied and pasted into terminal exactly what the guide said to do and following the instructions exactly do not work.

Not as easy to install on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. Been trying to install Bitcoin Core for a few days but keep getting errors and 404s. Following the guide in

I don't really understand what GitHub is and I didn't ever get Bitcoin Core to work on Raspbian with the Raspnode instructions. I ended up formating my microsd card and installing Lubuntu, then installing Bitcoin from the bitcoin.org instructions. I also had to do the fstab thing in my linked post to mount my USB HDD. Lubuntu + Bitcoin core is a lot easier to setup than Raspbian + Bitcoin.

Will this work in a FreeNAS jail? I've tried setting up a headless Bitcoin node to run on my FreeNAS server a few times before but it's a pain in the ass to get everything working correctly, especially since all I know is Windows.

How could I run this on a Raspberry Pi 2 and use an external 500gb HDD as storage?

Thanks I'll give this a shot later tonight. I think this is exactly what I'm looking for!

I use bitwage to automatically receive a percentage of my paycheck as Bitcoin. Haven't used an exchange to buy/sell Bitcoin in nearly 2 years now. I highly recommend Bitwage.

I have Bitcoin Core running on my Windows PC right now with the blockchain fully synced. I'm planning to get Bitcoin Core running on the Pi and then copying the blockchain files to the external HDD so the Pi doesn't have to download them itself. I have a small USB3 16gb drive I could use as a swap drive, I'm a linux newbie so I'm researching right now how to do that.  The speed of the Pi doesn't really matter to me as a bitcoin node is all i want it to do. I have another Raspberry Pi2 and Pi Zero laying around also.

Downloading to HDD before installing Lubuntu wouldn't work because when the Lubuntu.img is written it will format the drive and all data will be erased. What you could do is setup a pruned node until you get more storage. I think pruned nodes only use around 5gb rather than ≈160gb the block chain is at now.

I bought this external drive maybe 10+ years ago for about $100 for 80gb. What I did was just pop it open and slap an 500gb laptop 2.5" HDD I had inside for instant upgrade. Works no problem at all.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:34:15
Well my main reason really is "why not?" I had a RPi3 and spare HDD laying about so  I'm putting them to use. A node is also good for self verifying your Bitcoin transactions and other things of the sort.

I don't see why it couldn't run over WiFi. i have mine hard wired because just off camera is my switch and router, also i think with so much traffic a node generates it may saturate the wifi bandwidth and slow down speeds for phones and laptops.

I have to tinker around a bit to figure out how to port forward 8333 in my pfSense box with private internet access VPN running. My node has been running for a while and is fully synced but only shows 8 connections.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:37:53
I believe there's no difference to the network. I don't know the nitty-gritty details of how Bitcoin works under the hood so don't take word.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:29:47
It's pretty much the same as a regular Bitcoin Core full node but instead of storing the entire +160gb block chain you can set it to store only the most recent 4-5gb of block chain data, thus saves a lot of space. I'm not entirely sure how to change Core to a pruned Core as I've never done it. Search for pruned node and I'll bet you'll find some info.

Decided to dedicate my old Raspberry Pi ~~2~~ 3 to become a Bitcoin Core full node. Connected by USB is a 500gb external HDD I bought some time ago with Lubuntu 16.04 installed directly to HDD as the OS. I boot the Pi direct from the HDD as its much faster overall and so I don't have to deal with mounting drives and shares, everything just works easier.  The microSD card is just 2gb ~~with the only file being~~ copy all files and folders from HDD PI_BOOT to SD card, open "**cmdline.txt**" erase everything and paste  "**dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet loglevel=3 consoleblank=0 plymouth.enable=0 quiet init=/usr/lib/raspi-config/init_resize.sh**" to boot the Pi direct from HDD. I tried running Bitcoin Core on Raspbian but the install guide from Raspnode.com just takes forever and as a Linux noob it's just a pain when something doesn't mount or work right. Also, my local municipal ISP is fiber with unlimited up/down so no data caps to worry about.
Basically what I have is:
* Raspberry Pi ~~2~~ 3 (RPi2 might work as well.)
* Cheapest case I could find on Amazon
* 2 small heatsinks over the CPU and some other chip
* 2gb SD Card ~~(completely empty except for manually created **cmdline.txt** file with line above)~~ contents copied from HDD PI_BOOT with modified **cmdline.txt** file
* External HDD connected by short cable I bought on Amazon I think (bitcoin data files transferred from a previously synced PC running Core. Will take forever if trying to fully sync from Pi alone.)
* 2.5amp charger to power both the Pi and HDD
* Electrical tape to comically hodl everything together
* [Lubuntu 16.04 for Raspberry Pi]( burned directly to HDD via [Rufus](
* Bitcoin Core installed following official guide 
* Zram (open terminal **ctrl+alt+T**, type **sudo apt-get install zram-config** to get just a itsy bit more performance

I get 3% of each paycheck as BTC via  Of that 3%, 50% is auto sent to my Trezor address (savings) and the other 50% is sent to my Mycelium address on my phone (checking). 
I found this works best for me as each week I earn and receive BTC automatically without any need to manually transfer funds. It allows me to have BTC stored for long term in the same way as I keep a majority of my regular money in a credit union savings account. I'm also able to spend BTC on my phone anywhere that accepts BTC.
Since I started using bitwage I have had no need to access my Coinbase, Circle, or Gemini accounts in more than 1½ years.
