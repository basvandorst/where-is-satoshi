i cant send that dollar bill anywhere in the world, if i want to day trade with fiat i need to go through a bunch of bullshit regulatory papers, with crypto all i needed was an email address, i have access to world wide financing just by creating a wallet, how is our dollar better than that?

But none of you are answering my question. I want to know your sides and what kind of crypto currency the skeptics of Bitcoin want. I want to have a discussion bro.

I think education on how to protect Bitcoins is important. NO ONE can steal my cold storage Bitcoins. The Bitcoins I have online are subject to theft but I have an everyday wallet for everyday use that I don't keep a significant amount on so if stolen it's whatever. It would be the exact same if someone stole my wallet. I mean wallets filled with FIAT can be stolen, will the bank still give me my money back?

please explain intrinsic value

I know there isn't anything wrong with being skeptical. I want to know what it lacks from the skeptics point of view.

how? I couldve mined when Bitcoins were cheap but i thought they were a joke so i didn't. If you knew about Bitcoin mining and didn't mine that's your fault.

what did you do? and how would your ideal crypto currency be distributed?

AHH THE COMFORTS OF THE FIRST WORLDS, WHO CARES ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

so everyone that got rich from investing in apple early, was at the top of the ponzi scheme
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:23:58
me? how? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:56:56
clearly you didn't see what happened in Greece. i have FULL control of my Bitcoins. Credit card fraud is as easy as uniccshop.ru, websites like that have millions of infos for very cheap. the cost of stolen infos are then passed on to consumers, in the long run everyone pays for this. If your bank disappears NO ONE will give you your money back. that's naive to assume

you are smarter than me sir, i am sorry for insulting your intelligence
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:22:53

@_date: 2014-03-23 01:48:24
