bitconnect is a ponzi scam. i try to warn people on my channel about it. you only make money when you sign people up and scam their money from them. lesson learned. life is never as easy as handing someone money and getting more back. how on earth could anyone think thats a thing?

i love bitcoin, im no btrash shill. i dont hold btrash nor will i ever probably. but bitcoin needs a fixing, or, everyone needs to realize it is entirely for either large payments or simply as a savings method. a store of wealth if you will. a friend of my wife was trying to buy something online using bitcoin. she had 30 dollars in BTC 2 months back. now its worth 89. the product she needed was only 75 bucks. but because of the fees, she could not buy it. ended up having to buy more bitcoin, that also had a fee to pay it. its terrible for everyday use. they are not wrong when you see posts about bitcoin being unusable. use litecoin instead for payments.

very little to no people insult other cryptos here. sometimes BTC copies like BCH cause they take no imagination and they just make them for profit and no other reason. fuckem. other coins like monero, eth, ltc, etc. no one bashes, and most likely even own some alts. BCH was an attack. BTC defended itself and won, as always.

coins are premined by creators then distributed to participating exchanges, etc.

if my bank did i would choose a different bank. they simply can't afford to lose business like that. then it would get in the news and twittersphere, it would be bad for business no doubt. only way would be a federal ban in which all banks would have to follow. plus that sort if thing i just dont see happening anytime soon. i mean, banks now let you put money on stock and commodity exchanges, which you could simply turn around and sell for some other currency.

yeah there is a transfer fee. but if you have a lot of BTC you are getting an equal amount of B2X, so it could be profitable to you. if its a tiny amount. might not be worth it.

it's not FIAT because in FIAT we have a central bank with non-disclosed ledgers and policies. the bills are marked, thats all we know. one could create a fake dollar bill. its very hard, with all the new features on FIAT money, but can be done. to create a fake bitcoin would be virtually impossible or cost you millions of dollars. kind of similar i suppose. but maybe just think about it this way. one can be sent almost instantly, and almost free. the other one was created by fat old zionistic men who have lived a life of usury for generations. thinking of every way to get every single penny from you. thinking of every way they can infest new governments by starting wars. has fees at every corner. use your visa? oh thats a fee. america needs more money printed? thats a fee...your balls itch? thats a fee... there ya go! have a nice day!

love the idea of new businesses using crypto but ugh, with modern games nickle and dime transactions, endless DLC, pay-to-win. i cant say i like this idea. nothing good will come from this one. when amazon, walmart, etc accept crypto it will be a revolution. but no revolution will come from buying 10 random loot crates, or more "random item" to continue your candy crush shit simply is not. and will horde away coins away from a moving and usefull market. fuckem.

panic selling helps no one and only a few come out on top. investors are like horses. they need blinders on so they dont get spooked by bad news like jamie dimon. buying things with bitcoin, day trading, and hodl = ok. panic selling means you are a horse.

yeah definitely want to check your area for solar viability. only thing is that solar is pretty expensive upfront. and might not produce the power you need for it. I live in arizona where it is very common to see an array of solar panels on the top of someone's house in a neighborhood. but they are supplementary. and i dont think anyone ever steals them. i've never heard of it. but im sure it's been tried before at some point lol.
so you would need to consider that the miner will run all day. panels will not. even when the panels are running they don't produce an astounding amount. usually just covers your lighting bill at night. and they are mad expensive. Antminer + solar array = many thousands.

little fluctuation. its still at unprecedented levels. just a few days ago on the 12th it rose 1,000 dollars in 24 hours. more and more good news comes out about BTC daily. mainstream media is portraying it semi-daily. governments are beginning to accept it to pay taxes, etc. and those in nations like Venezuela are beginning to adopt it in mass to counter their hyperinflation. 1920's germans had to have a wheelbarrow of reichmarks to buy a loaf of bread. Zimbabwe at one point at 10 and 100 trillion dollar bills in order to buy even the simplest of goods. it will never go away. just hodl, buy with it, day trade it, use it. just dont be a horse and panic sell it.

dont tell our fine blooded americans to hodl, or call them girls! they drove our price to 5800 and then the scared horse investors drove it down. the damn scared nervous timid commies! stand up, dont sell, march in, gettem back. fear is not an option...or selling.

yes. just know that you should definitely hold on to most of it when you receive it. so by accepting it you will have less fiat. right now bitcoin is just going up and up, and honestly very little outlets to spend it commercially. just make sure you still got enough profit to keep buying more cars in fiat. until the day GM will sell you cars in bitcoin...which would be great. and when that day comes, bitcoin will go up in price even more lol. thats when you win big.

i blame the price drop on the fact that everyone is buying the new hot item apple wristwatch jet pack pro X. its a super hot commodity
