So you're blaming THEM? Are you kidding? Nobody forced you to pick up a cigarette. Just like nobody forced me to in Afghanistan. I became addicted, and there was nothing I could do in order to cease my addiction. E-cigs have been a liberation for me from traditional cigarettes (haven't purchased a pack in approx. 1 year and 9 months. You can hate on them all you want, but it doesn't change the facts. The facts are there are 1000's of carcinogens that have been PROVEN to cause cancer in traditional cigarettes. E-cigs offer VERY FEW ingredients - and to this date there is NO evidence that suggests inhaling pure nicotine, or the vegetable glycerin (as in this particular companies liquids), etc. causes cancer. There is no rat poison. Is this not an innovative and good thing for mankind? If you want to blame the innovators that are trying to tame one of the greatest killers in this world (tobacco industry) then you're a fool. Continue to smoke your normal pack of smokes and I'll gladly smoke my e-cigs with far more peace of mind.

I have been studying Japanese for over a year. Its literal translation is "break", but the Japanese use it as slang for "smoke break, or to have one cigarette"... :)

He makes a valid point. Wick tanks have fallen by the wayside in the last year. Perhaps looking into a bottom feeder, e.g. Kanger?
