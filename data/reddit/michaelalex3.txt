What’s the rule exactly? “If you aren’t paying for the product you are the product” or something like that?
Yeah... that applies here.

Except nothing bad is actually happening to these people? The point of my comment is that if you’re getting a service for free then they’re probably collecting your data and selling it, so throwing a hissy fit about it and posting articles with dramatic titles is silly.  Idk what you’re so worked up about.

Yeah this is such a dumb attitude.  I get not going into credit card debt, but a home is a smart financial decision.  It’s not about being “fancy”, it’s about not paying rent for the rest of your life.

I love that the replies to this don’t have any actual reply, they’re just insults.  Your logic seems sound and I’ll agree until someone actually posts a legitimate argument against it.

Assuming you a buy a house you can afford, a good portion of your monthly payment will go back into your principal, which means it’s going back into your pocket.  Also unless you’re in an overpriced market the value of your home will almost certainly go up over time.  And you’ll continue to pay essentially the same monthly payment forever, even even when rent prices go up.  There are far too many factors at play to say with certainty buying or renting is better, but it’s silly to just say buying is always worse.

Ah I see you're following the wsb philosophy of buying high and selling low
