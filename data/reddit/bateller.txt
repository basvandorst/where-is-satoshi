I think the reason employees don't get paid daily has less to do with the transaction fees and hassle of it all and more to do with interest. If I'm a company... I'm holding onto funds (wether employee funds, or POs I have net-30 on) as long as I can... to help my cash flow, and make interest.

I'm with you on this. If its true... Show the TXID. I've checked blockchain.. I dont see anything from when he said it took place.
I think hes trolling for attention.

Why hasn't she given credit to the main developer? 
Why are call-outs with proof showing she DIDN'T make the app ignored or removed?
Honest questions I want answered.
