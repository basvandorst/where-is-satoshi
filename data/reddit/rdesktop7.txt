You and me both. 
That web page if full of nearly meaningless marketing words.

Not sure if this supports the original position or not, but it looks like 50% of the population has some sort of smartphone. 
Then, if low cost smartphones become a thing, we may see more.

That won't help right?
I loose the phone, backups get me the app back, but that doesn't stop somebody else from using the phone to take my cash. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:30:26
No, many people do not lock their phones. 
I have no proof of this, but I'll bet that most phones are not locked.

I would still much rather have a keyboard, but everybody stopped making them. :(

Just like nearly every other currency on earth. 
BFD.

It appears that there was a full investigation of this guy, and he was cleared of all charges. 
Also, it looks like the allegations about a event that supposedly took place 15 years ago when the accuser would have been 15. 
Even if the accusations were real, that wouldn't make Pierce a paedophile, albiet still horrible. 
It sounds like this enolja guy is just looking for the worst tar brush to paint this guy with. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:02:41
not that I know of. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:32:56
Does anybody have a clear description of what is going on here?
This article seems to be full of quotes referencing things that I do not know about. 
What is this bitcoin foundations history?
Look at this collection of words from this article:
"But bitcoin isn’t ideological! Some stripling yips, dimly aware the slogan is NATO-grade BZ.
What to make of them? The mises-thumping market liberals, the high finance back-benchers, these… startup people. Each in his turn discovers modern political economy’s happy accident, a working stateless currency, and each continues the promotion of the State to de jure universality. They next rally around this word. Oh, you remember it. Every stunted little nequient and pasty oddity shrieks it in choral unison. The signature term of our gigantic Stockholm syndrome: Legitimacy."
What are the foundation supposed to be doing?"
Who the heck is this guy talking to?
All of the insults make me think that I shouldn't be giving this guy any legitimacy. 
IDK, there seems to be a few posts about the bitcoin foundation latley without many clear points other then "I don't like it!"

Be sure to copy that floppy

That was a play on some dumb anti-piracy campaign form the 90's
Here is a link to it. It's terrible.

The first time you use Bitcoin at a store is pretty exciting.

For those who do not know what jury nullification is, there is a really good video on it that cpc grey made a while back:

It sounds like somebody missed the boat.

Why on earth would you use western union to send money to others in the US?

I fully set up a account on circle. 
It's not working. I am not able to deposit funds. 
I switched back to using coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:23:50
I am glad circle was a fail for me.
The delay on circle allowed me to not buy at $360 last week. 
I bought a bunch at coinbase last weekend for $306/BTC.

According to the slide deck, corruption happens in one week after power off storage at temps above 55 C.
They do not list details about low temperatures. 
Ideal temp to store ssd's while off are 25 C.

I am unclear why people do not seem to understand why it is expensive to ship things internationally. 
First, there is the straight shipping cost. It can be $10-$15 by itself for basic slow shipping. Then, there is the labor in preparing all of the customs forms.

CES doesn't open until tomorrow, so, the stand is closed atm.

Most people with histories like that are deliberate trolls. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:23:53
Why would they do that?

Shops sell goods, not anonymity.

Just sent them 15 USD worth. 
Hope it helps them stay up.

For what it's worth, I have gone to various vendors because they were on coinmap.org, regardless of weather I wanted to use bitcoin there. 
bitpay.com shouldn't cost you anything to maintain, and as long as you pay your taxes on your income like normal, you are all legal. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:40:40
Correct. 
Sorry about that.

I already donate to NurdRage via patreon, but I just paid for this video with BTC to show support. 
After all, it was only 0.434 mBTC

I bought my own cable modem for use with comcast. They aren't terribly expensive. 
If you are able maybe leave comcast and at&amp;t?
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:54:23
Oh yeah. I am not visiting it either. 
I'll add this to the reasons why I do not show bitcoin to family members. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:10:10
I do not have my BTC in exchanges, but why are they so bad?
Serious question. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:21:54
The account is really bizarre. 
Check this out: 
So, this is a BTC 519 scam or something?
@_date: 2016-05-11 20:30:24
yeah.. Is this surprising?

I just received my silver from coinbaul. 
4 pieces that I ordered 2 months ago. 
Anybody have a similar story?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:48:36
Yes, there is very little privacy on apple products. They watch everything you do. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:58:55
Why are these marked up so much?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:50:25
What are you talking about? 
That's not a proxy filter at all. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:14:20
yeah.... 
Me either. 
Sucks to be us, doesn't it?
Any idea on any recourse? 
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:48:18
Any updates to this? 
Did you order from coinabul? If so, have you received your order yet?
@_date: 2013-09-16 00:47:11
I bought 10 of those miners about 2 months ago for similar reasons. 
I neglected to use the fan though. I think the fan is a little silly. Those miners should run rather well at 60C+.
@_date: 2013-09-13 08:44:41
Looks like it's troll time again.
