Done. Considering the defamation laws we have here, I won't go into too much detail but I've passed this on to someone who may be able to pass it on to the right people.
However, I would suggest people also email the Head Editor at the Bangkok Post - Pichai Chuensuksawadi: pichai

It's not just an attack. People (myself included) are worried about rising transaction fee's and the length of time it takes to verify a transaction. This goes against the entire premise of Bitcoin. It wasn't designed for HODL'ers, it was designed as a useful currency AND useful way of performing borderless transactions, to which, in its current form, isn't. We need lightening or segwit, or whatever it takes to restore its usefulness, unless it's gonna tank.

Luckily nicehash paid out in semi-regular intervals based on how well you were mining, so hopefully nobody who had serious mining going on is only out a few days. Still sucks though.

Ugh, Seagate. I have had far too many fail in our DC to bother with them again. HGST &gt; WD &gt; Fujitsu &gt; Seagate.
Even the WD Green's we have outlast the NAS grade Seagate's.

I was going to say this. This is becoming a huge problem. Fuckers wait until you fall asleep, initiate a number port so they can get the 2fa text before you wake up and realise your number has been ported. Scary times.

How'd they get your contact deets? Did the Coinbase customer db get hacked at some point?
