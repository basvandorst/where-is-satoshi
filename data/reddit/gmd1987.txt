Having Bitcoin flair site-wide could be pretty cool.  I just viewed the Bitcoin tip to be a catalyst for interest in Bitcoin
"Whoa, what is this? Some guy tipped the OP with some P2P currency instantaneously and it was valued in USD?  The OP made money on posting?  I can do that!  I want to learn more!"

We should have a Bitcoin tipping day where subscribers to this subreddit are encouraged to use the Bitcoin tipbot while browsing the rest of the site.  That way, the interest of regular Redditors will be piqued, hopefully to the point they come visit this subreddit.

Practically no work?  These are the people that organized and developed the first mining pools, coded Bitcoin clients and miners, and fully groked the Satoshi whitepaper.  Shouldn't the above be considered work and be rewarded as such?
Also, you are making the same mistake as above.  It's hindsight to look back and say, hey, look at how well that investment paid off!  Bitcoins traded at $30 at one point.  But do you think anyone who started CPU mining had that certain and clear view of the future?  That's why they are called early adopters and again, should be rewarded for catalyzing the technology.

Awesome! I tried compiling Ledger from source but then gave up and ended up just installing it from the Debian repos. There was, like, half a gig of dependencies.  Yuck.  Anyways, now that I can integrate my bitcoin holdings into it, I'll be playing around with Ledger shortly, maybe seeing if the source install is smaller.  Thanks!

I would highly recommend TangibleCryptography for your type of purchase and will vouch for the service.  I have done two transactions with him in the US of roughly your size.  Each time the process was clearly detailed, his communication was prompt and the transaction was very fast.  All in all, a reputable, professional dealer.  
Unfortunately, it looks like his service is temporarily down but will re-open with a new sales portal soon, so the process should be even simpler and efficient!

If electricity is your only cost, then to break even for each kW of power you use you will need to generate the BTC equivalent of 0.02 x 24 x 7 = $3.36 a week, or $6.72 every two weeks.  Using this calculator ( the current difficulty (2694047.95296) and exchange rate of $10, your setup will have to produce 128.5 Mh/s from 1kW of power to mine $3.36 worth of BTC.  The Bitcoin wiki compares cards ( by dividing the Mh/s divided by how many watts it draws.  128.5 Mh divided by 1000 is .1285 Mh/W, which seems more than reasonably to obtain.  That being said, with the release of ASICs the difficulty in the next few months will dramatically increase, some say by a factor of 10.  This should definitely cut into the amount of BTC your 128.5 Mh produces.

Hypothetical:  Since the difficulty for Namecoin is so low and "The going rate seems to be about 1BTC for 50 namecoins", would it be more productive/profitable to mine Namecoins?

Just last night I cranked up my 5830s to 300 Mhash/s.  300 x 8 = 2400, less of your total is 75 Mhash/s.  Is the 6950 really that slow?
@_date: 2011-05-13 00:04:32
How so?  I imagined it would increase performance the same way it is supposed to increase gaming performance (or is it a placebo?)  I have been trying to wrangle Phoenix into dealing with the two cards separately.  Each cards hashing set to separate works will increase my Mh/s?
@_date: 2011-06-29 12:52:50
Why not wait until the difficulty of namecoin drops even further?  Theoretically, their value compared to bitcoins should fall with the difficulty.
 
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:29:17
I think what people are failing to point out (or you are failing to recognize) is that is not so much the risk, but the risk relative to the reward.  
Yes, you are probably paying the same for electricity and doing many more hash calculations than the early adopters.  However, you have the advantage of hindsight.  You have seen that Bitcoin has not failed two years after it's creation, is still growing and that there is a fairly large monetary value to them.  The early adopters had to trust that an unproven system, susceptible to attacks, published by a mysterious figure from Japan, would yield something other than digital coins valued little more a penny.  
If you consider the then seemingly slight probability of success relative to the costs associated, then it's only fair that these people be rewarded for their foresight.

Well I initially figured that I have my computer on nearly 24/7, so what's the difference between it computing hashes or not...after more deeper thought, however, between the fan and the card, a mining rig has a much larger draw on power than a non-mining rig.  What would be the equation to compute the profit?  Average hours it takes to find a block times cost of 1 Kwh in my neck of the woods?

That's not a strawman.  I am asking you to cite an instance of a pyramid scheme where there was as much disclosure and transparency as an open source project not only offers but demands.  I am not taking your argument and replacing it with another

Exactly, it very much would be a company's digital BTC reputation.  What I really think would empower companies, especially in this community, is the full disclosure ("Bit Corp paid 33% of their revenues to employees, 27% on operating expenses, pocketed the rest")

At the time, it was 2/3 of a currency that was worthless.  
So you can argue that the currency's value increased because it had inherent value or that the whole thing is some sort of manipulative Ponzi scheme.  If it is a scam, I think there are easier ways to do it than convincing people to buy and sell 1s and 0s created by random people's computers running an open source project.  
The mining system might not be perfect but we are all-ears on how you think you could improve it...
