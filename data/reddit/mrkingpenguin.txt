So you've answered a lot of technical questions, now I have a few less formal ones if you don't mind. I've been a fan of yours bruce and enjoy your social media output
* How did you first get interested in bitcoin?
* What is educational background in, and how do you think your day job/ knowledge will help you be a better board member?
* Do you think bitcoin has a PR problem among the serious money?

You mind explaining why it's wrong? I'm fairly new to the bitcoin scene. Thanks

Lol this is gonna work...Let some random man on the internet speak to the head of my school.

I mean bitcoin isn't subject to manipulation in this way.

You, sir, are suspect.

Actually, for us people waiting for the price to drop &lt;$500 so we can finally buy it is fantastic news. People on this subreddit seem to have very short memories. Wall Street still has a good interest in Bitcoin and exchanges and an interest in a secure platform to trade them. Future is bright still

Jeez I wish that was true in the UK, the bloody government, desperate to get the pensioner and middle aged vote, have created a ponzi housing market with h2b and b2l that has priced out any first time buyer (even with a good job) due to the stupidly high prices. 
The **average** price in London is now over **£500,000**. Absurd.
At least with bitcoin prices actually mean something.

Yes! We are bitcoin not teenagers on the call of duty subreddit.

Don't worry I've got a firewall installed just in case...
