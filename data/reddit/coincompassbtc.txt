Yes and gold has been in a bubble since 40,000 BC and is still a store of value.

Yes it is a conflict of interest but that doesn't make him wrong.
People don't know when the next financial crash will be so "soon" could mean next month or within 5 years. Who knows.
Did you watch one of the later episodes on cryptocurrencies (hashgraph)?

Slow compared to what?  
Compared to other blockchains and traditional databases? YES, very slow.  
Compared to wire and bank transfers? NO, very fast.  
Like most things in life it's about perspective and for me BTC replaces central banks but isn't about buying coffee so I don't care too much about speed and fees but want to ensure only 21 million BTC ever exists.

The answer isn't gold or bitcoin it's both. Yes, at the moment everyone is FOMO'ing into btc but imagine if you're a noob who bought in at $20k and then probably sold under $10k or below? Not a great store of value. However, bitcoin is superior to gold in every single way except a store of value which  it will be once the volatility settles. Personally, I'm about 70% in btc, 20% in stocks and 10% in gold but of course I'd never financially recommend this. Diversify in assets not crpyto.

Don't worry bitcoin always give you many opportunities. Wait for a pullback and dive in!

Using your example gold hasn't made it either and is useless because nobody accepts it for payment that's obviously because gold is a store of value instead. So what is Bitcoin's purpose? That's the million Satoshi question and probably why we have 2000+ coins at the moment.
Merchant adoption and paying for things in btc might come but I think that's a long way off. Nobody wants to be the next 10,000 BTC pizza guy so why would you buy anything in bitcoin right now unless you don't have any fiat to convert and are earning btc for a living?
Bitcoin's use case isn't paying for coffee, although you can do that with LN and other 3rd party conversion services, but is replacing central banks. So far it's a speculative store of value and that's incredible given it's only 10 years old. Method of payment and unit of account is a long way off but I'd say Bitcoin has made it and is highly successful (so far).

Bitcoin is a tank in the middle of a warzone constantly being attacked but also improved and made stronger every single time. No other blockchain can claim this.

BISQ and others like localbitcoins and HODLHODL are great but the liquidity really sucks. I'm sure in time though they'll grow.

If you bought (insert stock) .... then ...
Yes bitcoin has had bigger gains than anything in history but "if only" investment hindsight is 20/20 and a meaningless hypothetical. Bitcoin is a speculative store of value which should be in everyone's investment portfolio (not financial advice).

1. Assuming you're using English, check and double-check each of your 24 words against this list: [ \&gt;&gt;&gt; DO THIS IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT &gt; preferably offline and with a read-only linux distro.
2. Still no luck try similar words and spellings but of course this list could be endless
3. If you think your words are correct, and as suggested below, you have the wrong order. Try restoring the words vertically instead of horizontally. e.g. 1, 3, 2, 4, etc.
4. How do you know only one word is incorrect? I'm pretty sure the recovery seed on Ledger (24 words) either works or it doesn't regardless of how many incorrect words (e.g. 1 or 10) because that would reduce the possibilities enormously.
Other than that there's not a lot you can do except think back to when you were entering the seeds. Sometimes if you don't think about it the answer will come in the middle of the night or in the shower. Good luck :)

Hardly, we've only barely started.

If you need to ask then neither!

The answer is it depends, just like "Which is the best car?" For what purpose, trading or investing?  Which crypto? How much? Form of payment? etc. etc. etc.
In general:
* Bitstamp, Binance, Coinbase Pro, your local country's exchange, etc. for the best liquidity but worst privacy
* localbitcoins, hodlhodl, bisq, etc. for the worst liquidity but best privacy

A bridge is a good bridge until it falls down. MtGox was fine until ...
However, if we're talking under $250 then I think it's okay to leave that on CB although that $250 could be $2,500 in 5 years.
A Ledger or Trezor is definitely worth it but as you said it's maybe too expensive and inconvenient. Therefore, the best compromise is a non-custodial software/mobile wallet, e.g. Samurai, Green Address, Wassabi, etc. you hold the keys but more convenient than a paper or hardware wallet.

Bitcoin is borderless and your survey is US-centric so the answers are irrelevant.
