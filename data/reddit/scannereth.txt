I would say when someone hires contractors to work on a project that has no development team at all (aside from a reddit channel and a listing on Poloniex), then yes, that is a move to take the project over. I am assuming that these contractors owe allegience to you because you are paying them? There is no independent Ethereum Classic Foundation is there?
Ethereum Classic is a way for you to troll the people that fired you. I get it. I've been fired from places too and would love to stick it to them, but then I realize that is childish and just leads to self-destruction.
And yes CEOs are employees too. Can you name one thing you did while CEO of the EF that has had a lasting impact on the project today?

I was surprised because I had been using them for a good 3 years straight for coinbase transactions. I had one $3000 coinbase transaction arrive the day the account was closed. This was recently.

What are you excited to watch concerning Bitcoin in 2017?

Ripple is still the number 3 coin with a market cap of 230 million and I have never met anyone who actually uses it or owns any of it. Market caps are easy to manipulate. 
Usually cryptocurrencies are founded by a dev team and have to fight for acceptance and to be listed on exchanges. ETC was listed on Poloniex immediately and had support from major bitcoin holders the same day. Months later, an ex-EF employee hires contractors who have never worked with Ethereum before at his own expense. He has no interest in coding it himself. Its obviously a way to try to weaken Ethereum proper while at the same time make money with minimal effort.

I called their headquarters customer service number. It wasn't at a branch. The whole point of CapitalOne 360 is that there are no branches.

ETC was created on Poloniex and was pumped by Barry Silbert as a way to divide Ethereum. It had no community before Poloniex listed it and has since been taken over by Charles Hoskinson, a disgruntled ex-employee of the Ethereum Foundation. It's basically a vanity project at this point.

Capital One 360 closed my account and transferred my money out to a linked account on the same day and then sent me an email after the fact. I called them and they transferred me to a manager. I asked them why they closed it and they told me they couldn't tell me. I then asked them if it was a secret and they told me it wasn't. I asked them again why they closed it. The guy at the other end of the phone paused, and then said "I understand sir". I had been with them for over 10 years and only used Coinbase to make bitcoin purchases and sales. Horrible bank.

You could. You would have to integrate a coin mixer at this point since transactions are view-able on block explorers (same as BTC) or wait for full scale ZSNARK integration, which I am not up to date on.

No, it wasn't. My account was already closed when I called. I received an automated email informing me of this. The customer service manager told me there was nothing he could do as my account was already closed. I think it was flagged for buying and selling large amounts via Coinbase by CapitalOne's software. Heaven forbid an actual human step in and assess the situation. It is easier for them just to auto close and move on.
I did ask if there was anyone else I could talk to regarding why exactly my account was closed and he told me no.
CapitalOne might ignore small amounts of bitcoin bought and sold. I have no idea since even their employees seem clueless as to what constitutes an account closure.

Barry Silbert and Chandler Gao are big Bitcoin boosters and are members of the ETC community now. They were both anti-Ethereum until the day Poloniex listed ETC, then they suddenly were pro-EthereumClassic only. There was no development team at all until Charles Hoskinson hired some inexpensive unknown contractors on his own. The majority of ETC twitter followers are fake accounts. These are facts.
