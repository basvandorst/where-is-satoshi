FYI, people did know ahead of time, but it really was just detective work.
Or maybe just watching the news.

I'm going to assume by this "insider trading" comment you never leave your comfort bubble. It was widely known that Coinbase/GDAX was going to support BCH. They said so last summer and recent tweets indicated it would probably be before Segwit. The timeline they gave was before the end of the year. Guess what its 11 days until the end of year. Earlier this week people noticed their API included BCH options. Earlier this week people noticed their help page included BCH references. 
If you didn't see any of that news, and are suddenly taken by surprise you really need to expand your information sources.

Well obviously BCH isn't the topic of this sub reddit as the name implies, so don't expect to see news about it here. 
The sidebar suggests for altcoin discussion. From there you can find links to all the other dedicated sub reddits.

Do you think I peruse the help section of gdax and the API? Nope I just subscribe to a couple more crypto subreddits than you. 
Try as the side bar suggests.
For christ sake, the Coinbase CEO was on CNBC a week ago talking about this and you think its "insider trading". Your grandma may have even known this was happening before you did.
