Contact your bank just to make sure it wasn't something on their end.  I doubt that's likely given that it nearly went through, but it can't hurt to check, and it'd save you a lot of trouble if it's just sitting in your bank account because you tripped some protection system.

I should note that I have no horse in this race.  I just like making crazy predictions and saying, "I told you so!" once in a blue moon.  "Wow, you're in a good mood today!  Did something happen?"  "Yeah, I won an argument on the internet!"
I'll see myself out.

So that you can't tell they're insolvent.

I see Bitmain coming out of this with a hefty profit if BCC dies.  They're going to have a controlling majority over the currency and the primary exchange on which it's traded.  They can exclude other miners, prioritize their own liquidation transactions, and bail early.  To make matters worse, here's a quote from their blog:


This means that any public mining will be for naught, because as soon as Bitmain publishes their chain, it's going to take precedence over everything else (it will be longer), and all other blocks will be lost.
This setup has a lot of advantages from Bitmain's perspective:
* They have the power to mine exclusively, if they so choose
* There won't be any public accountability for as long as they please
* They have full control over the exchange platform
* ... and therefore the exchange rate
* ... and priortization of transactions on the exchange
* They can priotize their own transactions on the blockchain, and nobody will be able to tell
* By the time anybody can prove anything, Bitmain will have exchanged everything back to BTC, and BCC will be dead
Of course, this all assumes there will actually be demand for BCC--and, unfortunately, there will be.  Bitmain is spreading all sorts of propaganda, and the Asian markets are taking it seriously.  Additionally, Westerners who dislike Coinbase and similar exchanges are quick to praise BCC as enforcing accountability.
China is going to scoop up BCC during its intro.  Bitmain will be able to generate a significant amount of BCC, which it will then trade for BTC on its own exchange.  Nobody else will be able to cash out their BCC because Bitmain's transactions will be prioritized and will saturate the market.
