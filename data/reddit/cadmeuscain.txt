It's part of Eclair's configuration. No reason it can't be different. 


When you open a channel with another node it's up to that node to accept the channel or not. It doesn't even matter which channels they have have with anyone else.


No one can tell you. It's developing way quicker than anyone could have anticipated. Remember that the devs working on it are building an entire new network from scratch. So far it's going brilliantly.
Right now you can use it to use micropayments with whoever accepts it. Like BitRefill or Satoshi's Place. Nobody can tell you when Starbucks or some other coffee place will accept it. Wallet developers are building autopilot features that will make channel management and whatnot a lot easier for the general public but, again, somebody has to actually go and develop it. It isn't going to fall out of the sky.

Me personally? Only a couple a year. Not too many. 
The company I work for: all the time in international business. Possibly weekly. 
My family/friends who have relatives in India or parts of Africa, monthly.
Really depends person to person. I think the availability of the technology also warps behaviour. So in the days of the post: people sent overseas letters infrequently (maybe once a month if you have a penpal). With email I send multiple overseas e-mails a day (sometimes as many as 50 a week). I wouldn't send this many if it cost as much as the post.
One way to see this is as an enabling technology. How often will it be used? Let people use and let's see.

I agree. Hence the spend and replace. Spend $10 on some bullshit then buy $10 in Bitcoin to replace what you spent.
It's been working well for me buying books and games online. And it's good for getting experience with wallets and the network in practice.

So true! I work in the financial sector. All the time I come across Blockchain-crazy people who think Bitcoin is a scam.

Sounds like you might want to ask that business school for a refund.
For the best explanation of what Bitcoin is solving, read the Bitcoin white paper from 2009.
If you do an international wire transfer, it takes a week and costs over $50. If you send someone Bitcoin, you can do it internationally in 10 minutes for under $1 right now. Is that not a solution to a problem?
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:11:27
The point of confirmation is to *remove* trust from the equation. Once a transaction is confirmed, it's been permanently added to the ledger. Until then, it hasn't really happened. Think of it like giving someone a cheque: until they cash it, you don't really have the money, so generally you only take cheques from people you trust. I'd take 0-conf from a friend, but never from an anonymous person the web.
You can attack 0-conf by broadcasting another transaction spending the same outputs at a higher fee. If miners see two transactions with the same Bitcoin, and one pays a higher fee, they are incentivized to take that one. Some 0-conf supporters have argued that miners should just take the one they get first, but this is relying on miners to be altruistic and go against their incentives. Again: the whole point of Bitcoin is to *remove* trust by aligning individual incentives with what's best for the network.
The only way to reliably accept 0-conf is to be aware of all transactions on the network so that you can reliably detect double spends; basically running a full node. Long-story short, you cannot completely eliminate fraud, in which case why use Bitcoin?

You can't atomic swap on a testnet. You need a real mainnet with real money on the line to really get a proper testing environment. 
It will always be less risky to implement a big change on Litecoin than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:45:57
I think the chances are good that CSW is Satoshi. Satoshi definitely seemed like the type who would go full billionaire mode and patent everything because he has more money than your country. I mean, it's not like he gave the world Bitcoin for free.
EDIT: /s just in case

I'm of the opinion that we should just leave Bitcoin Cash to do their own thing. Every time I log onto r/btc all I read is "Lightning Network sucks" and "Blockstream Core was seed-funded by Lucifer". Instead of giving them free publicity, just leave them to do their thing. In only a couple of months, we've seen which network has grown more in hashrate, transaction volume, active addresses, new tech developments, has retained it's value better in a bear market, any metric you want.
If Big Blocks are a better policy, that's what will win long-term. But even in the short-term, it doesn't look convincing.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:56:50
Sure pretty much. Plus atomic swap capabilities.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:25:02


I heard that. It was amazing!
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:32:56
Also: we can still transact on the Blockchain :). Lightning is not THE solution, it is one of many compatible scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:14:02
Lightning Network is not 0-conf. The Bitcoin spent has been locked into channels by confirmed transactions and secured by channel penalties.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:27:23
Litecoin's true value is in providing a support to Bitcoin. They activated Segwit first, and Litecoin is the only other coin to allow Lightning. If fees are high on BTC it will be possible to open channels with LTC and atomic swap them for Bitcoin in the future.
There are definitely some corner cases where Litecoin has and will be useful. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:30:25
Love it. Keep them coming experts!
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:32:21
Definitely agree. As someone who's been doing a lot of Lightning transactions, I've experienced first hand a lot of bugs like transactions failing repeatedly even when there's a route to a peer, transactions that stay pending for 2 weeks, channels closing all of a sudden etc. I accept this because I understand I'm still using a Beta and this technology still has a good few years to go before it's ready to scale for general use.
I just think that a lot of the FUD against Lightning is counter productive. At a base level it works! You can actually send someone 1 US cent for basically nothing and that's amazing. But it's like LN has a fully dedicated bench of shit-talkers who endlessly come up with strawman criticisms for why LN will never ever be useful.
Even when it's done it won't solve all of Bitcoin's scaling issues. It is one of many modular scaling solutions including sidechains, TX optimizations, signature aggregation etc.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:21:47
This is really bad. Lightning haters now have to find new and intricate FUD to replace the old FUD. First Lightning was vaporware, then it was in Beta, then it was only useful for small amounts. I myself have been painting on Satoshi's place and have been very disappointed that my transactions have been quick and cheap. If this is where Lightning is now in only 6 months, imagine where it will be in a year or two :(.
In the meanwhile, I've come up with some new FUD that haters can use. Use it quickly, because at this rate, it'll become obsolete:
* You cannot buy a house with LN
* You cannot buy a car with LN
* You cannot buy love with LN
* LN won't be there for you when you're alone (ok, as long as your channels are open it will)
* LN is a security
* LN can never be a security
* LN is off-chain
* LN requires on-chain transactions (see what I did there?)
* LN hurts people's feelings who don't like it
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:14:48
Before you call people dumbasses maybe do a little bit of reading first. Just to make sure you actually get the point you're trashing.
Atomic swaps are peer to peer exchanges. They do not increase the supply: someone trades you BTC on lightning for LTC on lightning. Combined with submarine swaps, you could potentially trade BTC on-chain or off-chain for LTC on-chain or off-chain. Aside from replicating custodial exchanges (without custody), there are many instances where something like this might be useful (e.g. topping up or emptying out channels without closing them).
Economically, there is a sound basis for this as well. Historically gold and silver (and even bronze) were used as money at the same time. Silver was demonetized eventually due to the fact that it's stock corrodes (allowing it to be debased through the inflation). Litecoin with it's fixed supply doesn't have this problem 
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:11:23
Testnet can't do atomic swaps to mainnet. And while any coin CAN do these things, none of them are actually doing it.
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:11:51
This is complete bullshit. You can get *at least* six thoughts for your Bitcoin at the current market rate.

How could Nick possibly be Satoshi? Based on his profile picture, he's around 4 years old. Yes, admittedly he's a very gifted 4-year old as one can tell from reading his blog, but he would have only been born a few years after Bitcoin was invented.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:57:32
It's true but small is a relative term. Low liquidity is a result of people intentionally putting small amounts in channels to prevent fund loss in the case of bugs. As Lightning matures, it's very possible for a company like Amazon to have $1m in "small" channels (these companies have millions in cash reserves) that is capable of routing transactions from their storefront. These individual payments could easily be a few $1000 each.
So maybe not a house but your groceries, books, clothes, electronics etc. As for buying love, we may need a sidechain for that.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:05:46
Would you mind launching a mainnet version? Even if it's a beta with tons of disclaimers and bugs!

bc1 and 3 addresses are not all that different. But the bc1 addresses use a character set that is easier for humans to read, and they don't care if characters are capital or lower case, so less chance of making an error. They're meant to be more friendly to humans.

This might be less of a problem with Bitcoin and more of a problem with Reddit in general. Many of the SubReddits become echo chambers since people who already agree with the premise of the sub are the ones posting in it.
E.g. try posting about the positive aspects of religion in r/atheism.
As for criticism of Bitcoin, I find it helpful to read across SubReddits. E.g. r/Cryptocurrency for the Altcoin View, r/btc for the BCH view. Twitter is also more open. If you wanna know the biggest flaws in an idea, go ask the opposition.

Indeed. To me the whitepaper is clear: Bitcoin is the longest chain supported by the majority of nodes. Obviously things are going to change, Satoshi isn't in the picture anymore. 
In any case: Bitcoin is determined by consensus, not one person's vision regardless of whether or not they created it.

I actually find it one of the most balanced SubReddits. Every positive post about Craig Wright is perfectly balanced by a negative post about why Lightning will fail.
Lightning will definitely fail, you know, because it's completely centralized around only a few thousand nodes. While 0-conf BCH, which is mined by one company, is free to all.

There's an Android Wallet called Eclair that should be launching on the Play Store soon (it was there but got removed by the devs).
Note that if your BTC is on Coinbase, it's not under your control, it's under Coinbases. If it's a significant amount of money, consider getting a hardware wallet. At least research some Mobile wallets.
Here the steps for Lightning:
**WARNING: Lightning is still in Beta so there could be bugs. This is not easy for beginners. Use small amounts of money that you don't mind losing!**
1. Download Eclair (when it comes back) or another Lightning wallet (like Zap)
2. Create or restore a wallet in Eclair
3. Send money to your Eclair wallet (it's now ready to use as Bitcoin wallet)
4. Go to channels and open a Payment Channel. Eclair allows you to open a channel with one of their Nodes. You can also open a Lightning node with someone else.
5. Wait for the other party to confirm the channel. Congrats, you are now on the Lightning Network
6. [Buy shit](
7. [Mourn for babies](
