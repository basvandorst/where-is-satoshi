I feel attacked
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:09:58
Feel your pain. Opened mine back in 2015 but was employed, broke and honestly uneducated so here I am now buying at 11k 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:44
I fucked up and bought at 16k ��‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:24:06
$20k by 2pm tomorrow, calling it now

Fuck this thread and my Mario Odyssey obsession

I saw it hit 17k, got busy at work, and now it’s at 17k. I missed the 19k in its entirety.
Welp, see it again by 10pm tonight

Everyone’s posting their bitcoin investment success stories, I think it’s time to post mine
I finally bought Breath of the Wild ��

At the same time, don’t be afraid to go with your gut.
I bought at 16k, ended up selling at 16k (the dip seemed imminent, which it was), rebought at around 13k, and now I’m sitting at a profit. Don’t live under paranoia but also trust your instincts.

I bought at 12k and bought nothing at 3k
But, I hedl. I didn’t crack.
And now my money from 2017 is back and better than...well better than it was
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:35:15
I regret not buying more when it was like 4K. I’m an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:39:26
Agreed. I was thinking “eh fuck it I’m too broke to gamble, I’ll just let what I have grow”
And now I’m mad cause I could’ve had more.
