Ah, I'm assuming it's because people transferring to Trezor are more likely transferring larger amounts than to BreadWallet. Either way thanks a bunch I really appreciate your help.

Man that is truly saddening to hear.. I thought it was going to just be because he sold them to help your family and the price went up significantly.. but because somebody hacked him, that's just terrible. Everyone sees the bright side in this game because when that graph goes up your body gets such a big dopamine hit, it's really not like anything we've seen before and that scares the absolute shit out of me. I feel for you and hope your family can bounce back in any sort of way! Stay strong man

Do you have just btc or did you diversify in alt coins too?

All I'm saying is Tesla was the one to get the ball rolling, I never said they had some wonder car that could fly. Elon isn't the guy to spend 30 years crafting a car to be perfect, he knows where we need to go as a society and he uses his influence to push us there. I get there are other electric cars and other companies working on self driving cars, there's also other cryptos out there but just like Tesla, bitcoin is the face of them and usually gets all the recognition.

Congratulations! Can't wait to get into BTC myself and may we reach the moon!

Thank you very much, this looks like the way to go for me. I'm assuming GDAX to Trezor would be instant right? Really have no clue how Trezor works but I'm assuming you just transfer your BTC to that.

I'd have to disagree with you in a sense. I'd agree that Tesla cars in terms of overall soundness and quality might not be that great, but it's Elon pushing an electric car that's affordable into the market forcing other established companies to follow. Self driving technology was only talked about because of Telsa, and that's why I personally think Tesla is groundbreaking.
