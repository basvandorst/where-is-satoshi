what does bitcoin have to do with physics?
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:45:26
My point is you would never need to hide a million dollars because thats not how wealth management works at that level. And the government knows you purchased BTC too, they see your internet activity and your phone activity. Yes they can see i purchased gold, but even if i needed to hide 1million of it they have no idea where its hidden because its a physical commodity, not a line of code. You have no idea what the government is truley capable of, especially in the future, they will probably be able to steal 100% of ALL BTC in the snap of a finger before long if they really dedicated the resources to it.
The reason its easier to *move* (not hide) 1mBTC is because its digital, meaning less secure/more fluent
Youre making my point, dude. The reason gold would be more inconvenient to hide is the same reason that makes it secure. Its real, its an element on the periodic table, BTC can be traced from start to finish, its just computer code, meaning its vulnerable to anything over the course of time. Gold only comes from one source (supernova stars, the government cant fake/steal that) and its only traceable when transacted, and even then only if its purchased/sold digitally.

If you have millions of dollars you would not put it into a single asset anyway no matter what it is, you'd be diversified into businesses, real estate, promissory notes, bonds, stocks, etc. But even if you did have millions in gold you could afford to have it moved anywhere at any time.
Not to mention you would also have international investments and the financial resources to legally combat the government and make a big stink of them fucking with you.
Plus if you have millions, you're one of the wealthy people the government is working FOR.
And the government CAN track where your bitcoin is, they cant control my mind and make me go dig up my gold and hand it to them.

I would much rather own the equivalence in real estate than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just much more accessible to millennial right now, that doesn't mean its preferred or a better investment.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:08:12
Thats not true. You own the real estate, you just also own the loan, that doesnt mean the real estate is any less of an asset. You can put anything up as a security and the bank is happy to take any asset (cash or otherwise) in payment of the loan. Its up to the investor to calculate the risk of the leverage to make profit. The banks dont "own" people who borrow, its actually much more profitable to purchase real estate with a loan than our right cash. NOT lending would be a more secure but less profitable move.

Dude... what are you doing!?! Lol

Studies say Millennials will be the most wealthy generation because of inheriting boomer assets, not because of income. I doubt many millennials will sell their families estate for bitcoin...

Oh Ive suggested real estate rentals as a viable long term investment and they remove/downvote me. Theyre a joke. Most financial subs just parrot throwing everything you have at a 401k and waiting 100 years

Negative interest rates means you get paid to borrow money and lose money in savings accounts, so naturally people take loans to buy things. If youre smart, you buy cashflow assets, if youre reckless and foolish (like most people) you over extend on poor assets and go bust when you cant pay it all back. When enough people bust, you get a market crash and the taxpayer foots the bill to bail out the banks.
Example: 2008 housing crisis

@_date: 2019-10-09 13:42:19
Not at all. I’m not sure what you classify as “expert”, but you have to do your due diligence like you would with any investment but the idea is they are passive, thats the entire appeal. 
I get paid because Im the owner of the asset therefore entitled to its profit. There is no day to day or "full time" work after purchase.

In those circumstances, its a possibility to take a bit of a loss if you dont have renters, depending on your finances and lending agreements with your broker, but most people defaulted in 2008 because they got adjustable rates and were not responsible about their rate hike. As an investor IMO its best to go with a fixed rate to keep your numbers consistent and it eliminates the risk of holding bags like in 2008. As long as you have good profit margins and dont over extend you'd be fine.
Youre renting the property, not flipping it. Depreciation isnt much of a concern unless you plan to tap equity for more investments. As long as you have renters paying the mortgage youre fine.

...and will move their money into traditional hedges like gold and real estate. Crypto might be a strong alternative down the road, but it’s seen as too volatile for retirees and investors focused on security.
Your average 60-something year old isn’t going to put money into bitcoin to protect their life’s work. They’ll buy small rentals in cash for their family or gold at the most. 99% of them will just liquidate and sit on the cash until their tax advisor tells them to put it in a fund

Youre making alot of negative assumptions about your tenants that proper screening and credit check would protect you from.
I see your point but I think you're cherry picking the ultimate worst case scenario. Obviously there is risk in anything that involves profit. Real estate is traditionally a hedge against a bad economy plus youd be diversified in other things as well. Its a safe bet, people bust their ass to pay rent no matter what, you ever heard of a landlord lowering rent? 
yeah 2007 would have been a bad time to buy for this particular asset class, but that was almost 12 years ago, since then, by now, youd have 12 years of healthy tenants paying rent. Yes 2008 happened, every other year it didnt happen youd be getting paid.
Saying "well this one time over a decade ago..." isnt a reason to not use leverage to invest in something that traditionally makes the difference between the poor and rich. Human history has ALWAYS favored land owners. That wont change in our lifetime. Real estate is just one example but unless you have hundreds of thousands just lying around youre going to HAVE to use a loan to buy real assets, that or be a salary slave for forever and a day. And the lower the interest rate, the higher the profit.

@_date: 2019-06-18 15:24:10
Same as gold but people have been trading it for thousands of years and the price is not moon-level. Finite and market demand are two different things.
Land is not easily exchanged as a currency like gold or BTC. IMO the same philosophy doesn’t apply. You’re trying to relate the value of two different asset classes.
@_date: 2019-10-08 23:08:53
Yes. Using leverage (a loan) gives you a better return on investment. There is much larger profit margins but obviously the risk of being on the hook for the loan.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:39:01
Great movie. But the general public does not see bitcoin as a healthy hedge like gold. In the short term if there is another crisis, bitcoin will drop as well.

For sure, I agree with that.
I’m not saying gold is a more convenient way to trade.
OP suggested a philosophy that’s used to promote real estate as a way to measure the value of Bitcoin, when that’s now how it should be viewed, it should be viewed as a currency similar to gold.
