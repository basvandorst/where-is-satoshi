Great tip about Bitsquare! I'm a big fan of decentralized technologies (that's why I want to buy bitcoin also!), and Bitsquare is exactly that. On their youtube demo video it was easy to understand. Aside from the learning curve, this is a great place for getting bitcoins with no ID. So... after installing the Bitsquare software do I just use my bank account to transfer euros or dollars to the seller ?

Yeah I saw that there's that dual fee system... I think it's a legitimate reason. These bitcoin exchanges are all subject to government regulation, which in my limited knowledge, costs extra and cuts into a company's profit margin.

Hi, good advice. I'm reading up on Localbitcoins it has many good reviews and I see that no ID verification is needed to buy bitcoin with a bank transfer. Another redditor said it - prices are higher per coin. Is this because of the peer-to-peer nature of the exchange?

Nice explanatory link there, thumbs up to you! I've bookmarked that guide, as I've some family members starting off in bitcoin and they would need to read something like this. 
I think I'll use either something like buysomebitcoins (as they do card purchases which is so much more simple), or localbitcoins as a few other comments here have given strong recommendations for it. Those two sites are the best places for buying bitcoin without ID verification from what my research has shown so far.
