Wow, no and no.  This isnt a trick.  Its a tool for users to remember the keys and seeds from lost cold storage and devices.  Of course if you dont put rigor in you text creation then the result could be bad but that goes for everything crypto.
As far as entropy your text needs to be at least 40 characters preferably much longer.  Historically they’ve ruled brain wallets very bad, which they are.  Thats why KeySnap requires significantly more than the traditional 256 bit Bitcoin hash to generate keys.
Mnemonic phrases for hardware wallets are at most 28 generic words long.  Consider this when creating your text.  It can be a double edged sword so i encourage everyone to be extensive and careful with their text use

Its a worry yes, there are many unique patterns using personalized text that would be nearly impossible to replicate unless the attacker knew your text and pattern

Thats pretty harsh.  And not completely accurate.  If it was all hardware wallets would be compromised.  Again be clever.  Dont even use words if you dont want scramble with your own pattern.  We cant force people to be clever but those that are shouldnt be banned from using a tool because it might cause problems for the unintelligent.

Regardless of your terse response i do hear you.  The current failing with the app it seems is there isnt enough warning.  I need to change the verbiage and extra tips for what patterns to avoid.  In the end the app is still a tool that benefits the informed.  Its obviously controversial but Im hoping it helps those users recover their lost funds

To some extent yes.  You can create multiple keys by increment of the pin so yes it could be a key pass.  It is mostly intended to help users recover lost keys by remembering the specific chosen text you used.  Its also a great way to share funds verbally.  Its a nifty tool if used with care.  It stores no data on the device and is intended to be used offline.  No app can guarantee a device isn't compromised but in theory if your keys were crafted offline and the device is not compromised then there is no way keys could be pulled from the device after it was connected to the internet as no data or history is ever available.

Thats true, I worry adding a randomized feature to the app will undermine how memorable it is for the user., users have the option to choose random words as well.  The responses ive been getting are very honest and most people are concerned they will create text that will be hacked.  Im going to add extra tips in app and change verbiage to discourage generic text grabbing without manipulation in some way.

When connecting your hardwallet to a machine to make a purchase or sell is there a concern that the machine you are using is compromised?  Does it matter?

wait... so Litecoin does have centralized mining issues and it isn't implementing segwit?  Turn up with a real argument...
