Fair enough. Just be aware that what you are doing right now amounts to picking winners and losers amongst your clients and that is guaranteed to backfire. Either stick to your TOS and battle it out with those who had the wallets drained (risky) or give everyone a haircut.

@_date: 2016-08-06 23:41:21
Well, they have been getting excellent legal advice. My aunt is a commercial appeals court judge and she confirms that in bankruptcy, the companies creditors would all get equal treatment, unless they had previously negotiated preferred conditions. Knowing all that, they would immediately get their accounts frozen if they started treating USD or ETH holders better than other. So, they could either do this now, where everyone loses 36%, or they can go into receivership and you lose 36% plus legal fees plus 3 years where your funds are frozen.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:14:31
No, I actually held USD, very few coins. The logic behind their decision is this: IF they were forced into bankruptcy, any court in BVI or HK, or even Germany and the US would ordain equal treatment for equal creditors. That means, since no clients had negotiated preferential creditor status, i.e. their own special terms and conditions, all BFX clients are creditors of equal status. That means, everyone shares in the losses equally. BFX decision therefore leaves no incentive to sue (unless you have too much money), which means the can continue operating and also allow withdrawals. Had they created a subgroup of customers and settled them only with the loses, those customers had incentive to sue, because they would win, and then we would be super-fucked, because that means no withdrawals, frozen accounts for years, massive legal fees, and in the end you get exactly the same loss distribution. Got it?
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:47:55
I agree. Don't commit commercial suicide, but people do need to see the owners putting in a serious amount of cash. If that means selling the Lambo, well tough. And don't throw the TOS in anyone's face. You did f*** up the one single thing that needed to be 100% right. I mean, holding some funds in a few cold wallets in a few safe deposit boxes in a few banks could have worked wonders here... it's not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:32:17
I agree with Scepticisms. I think bankruptcy is the best way forward. That little plan of burdening only some users won't work, because those users won't just sit back and take a loss just like that. They will sue, thereby posing a constant threat, which undermines trust of the other customers, who will pull their funds at the first chance.
In reality, it is very simple: a company lost so much money that they are unable to fulfill their obligations. At that point, they have to declare bankruptcy, otherwise they open themselves up to criminal charges. The world goes on, merrily, without Bitfinex.
The easiest way forward is to calculate what Bitfinex owes each customer in USD terms as per their price table at end-of-business. Then liquidate all remaining assets and pay that out immediately. Now some people might sue, but against which assets? And who cares? Finally creditors could take a small percentage to finance the ongoing effort to recover some of the lost BTC. 
The only other alternative is that Bitfinex somehow find approximately 60 million USD lying around to buy BTC and fill up their empty wallet. That seems unlikely, especially after demonstrating their utter incompetence. Most people would also rather take, say 70% of their cash now, instead of being mired in uncertainty for years.
In terms of why it is taking so long to get a site back up: I don't think it's a technical issue. I think they are talking to their lawyers and financiers at the moment.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:55:18
No, we don't know that. And they said they will publish full accounts. And since it is BTC, you can always follow see if anyone transferred out any assets. Furthermore, I don't care if someone got rich. All I care is about my money and having access to my money, because I know I can earn the loss back, instead of waiting for a 1000-page bankruptcy document in five years where I can read about details that I don't care about.
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:47:40
How does this affect people who engaged in USD margin lending? When someone borrows USD and then buys BTC, they don't have access to these BTC, hence they could not have been withdrawn, right?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:25:38
Exactly. Not paradise, but certainly better than bankruptcy hell.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:40:42
There is no reason / justification. It's just arbitrary. It is easier for them to only settle in BTC, instead of giving equal treatment for everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:56:36
I guess [you] ( spend more time thinking about this than me, but what is the point of a stagewise reboot? 
Stage A: People look at their losses and get really pissed off / anxious.
Stage B: People can only withdraw, not trade. So everybody will withdraw, either because they don't trust the site anymore and/or because you can't bloody trade. 
Stage C: Trading is up, but there is nobody left to trade, because everyone is trading somewhere else already and the funds were withdrawn in the previous stage. 
Doesn't sound that smart. Better come out of the gates storming.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:16:39
Maybe the exact figure is incorrect, but Bitfinex are [leaning towards a haircut] ( for BTC holders. I know that sounds good, but I think their logic for going only after one subset of customers is deeply flawed. Have BTC holders in some way acted less responsibly than ETC holders? Are ETH/ETC/LTC inherently safer investments than BTC, so that BTC holders had to expect greater losses? NO and definitely NO. The hacker merely chose to go for whichever type of coin was held in the greatest quantity by Bitfinex.
So I can't see how you justify only punishing BTC holders for Bitfinex's mistakes. [please explain exactly what your BTC customers did wrong and your other customers did right to justify punishing only the former.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:26:42
Well, thinking with my head here, why should I share the losses of Bitfinex? I didn't steal anything either.
Literally everyone can use this argument...

@_date: 2016-08-06 23:46:55
As soon as they go into bankruptcy, the funds are pooled.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:32:37
What are you - a troll? There is always recourse, especially with the sums involved and a case of gross negligence. But let's see what Bitfinex says on their upcoming statement.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:08:36
I wish crypto exchanges would go and learn how the nuclear energy industry designs for security. After the experimental phase in the 50s and 60s engineers realized that no matter what they did, they simply could never predict/prevent failures 100%. The plants are just too complex. So, they simply designed their security procedures by assuming that something major went wrong, even though they could not explain a priori how it would go wrong. 
For example, they just assume that a chunk of coolant pipe disappears. From that starting point, they create a protocol that the plant computer follows to shut down the plant and minimize leakage. If Bitfinex engineers had sat down one day and said: OK, let's assume 50% of our BTC disappear and what would we do, the exchange would probably already be online by now.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:13:44
Thanks for the reply. Hope you are right!
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:13:16
And one more thought. Why were you holding USD? Maybe because you just sold BTC or were just about to buy BTC? You just got lucky, that's all. You are trying to draw an arbitrary line in the sand. Had the hack come a few days earlier/later, you might have been one of the losers, too.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:56:45
You think the hacker got to Bob's coins? Positions held on margin could not be withdrawn...
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:50:42
This is all correct, until they are forced into bankruptcy by those people whose coins they lost by losing the private keys. Once in receivership, the funds are pooled. But you know what, go ahead and try, see how much good that does you. You seem like that person who walked in front of a car whose gravestone says "But he was right!"
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:07:55
People providing USD margin funding could be losing their USD to the extent that the counterparty bought BTC with the loaned funds. If those BTC are gone, the counterparty can't sell them to repay their USD loan. On the other hand, I think Finex had a rule that you could not withdraw BTC bought on margin. The hacker might not have stolen such funds, because their withdrawal should have immediately raise red flags on Finex. So it all hinges on how the non-withdrawal rule for funds bought on margin was implemented.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:13:48
So which exchange hasn't been hacked yet? The one were they trade half a coin per day?
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:25:28
What rules did Bitfinex have for making good margin lenders if a debtor did not have enough funds to repay the loan in full? For example, someone levered up to speculate in BTC and lost too much too quick for auto-liquidation, would Bitfinex have liquidated his ETH/ETC/LTC to repay the loans? The rules Bitfinex would have applied in this rare occurrence have become really important now.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:24:45
Does anyone know how many BTC Bitfinex was holding in total? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:52:09
Look, they receive praise, because of the many options available to them, they picked the one that will minimize everyone's loss, because it minimizes everyone's incentive to sue. That is why everyone here who wishes to access their funds anytime soon is so relieved.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:26:26
Then why are you so upset? If they are so good for it, than my writings shouldn't matter either way. Silence speaks louder than words.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:04:43
The whole point of the current settlement is that lawsuits become economically futile. People will only sue if they think they can get a significantly better cut than everyone else. The chances of that are low.
Think: official liquidation takes three years if everything goes smoothly. That means your cash is sitting in frozen accounts for three years. People were earning a good 15% annually even just lending out money. You can take 64 cents now and earn 15% annually for three years. That means those 64 cents become 97 cents.
Or you can take your changes and argue your case, which a judge may or may not agree with. You can't access the money and no matter what happens, you have to pay the judge, the interim manager and your lawyer from the assets that BFX is holding, even if you win (cause where else can the money come from). So even if you win, you will end up with something like 70 cents. So that is a big risk you take for maybe getting an extra 6 cents in three, when you could be making much more if you just took 64 cents now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:15:34
The best time to change a plan is before it is put in motion : )
Also, trust me, nobody is going to care about your explanation if you are hurting one group of customers more than another group. YOU lost the keys, not individual users. It was a central breach of security. I know it is technically more difficult to shrink everybody's funds, because you actually have to sell USD/ETC/ETH/LTC and buy BTC on the other markets. So what? Take a few more days.
Bitmex, by the way, also operate a policy of socialising losses across the entire platform.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:30:44
And how exactly am I better off by putting someone into jail?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:42:41
Yes, Bitfinex is keeping suspiciously stumm about that. Would love to know, too. I fear the stolen coins represent almost all they had. Why would the hacker only take, say, half of all coins??
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:31:00
Sounds like an elegant solution, though. Just make sure you cut everyone, not just BTC related positions. Less individual incentive to sue, wider spread of your finex-coin.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:30:57
MtGox was pretending to have coins that they didn't actually have. That is criminal. This here is just painful, but honest. It also does take balls not just to say "goodbye". It's a limited liability company and unless you can prove that they conspired to steal the coins themselves, they can just walk away and leave everyone waiting for receivership.
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:37:15
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:21:25
They are just mimicking what would happen in a bankruptcy. Equal losses for equal creditors. Unless you had negotiated special terms before this happened, you are not a preferential creditor in front of the court. So if you sued this thing to conclusion, equal losses is what you would get. Only now you save 3-5 years and massive legal fees.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:16:12
Not if your business is worthless. Also, there is nothing special about crypto exchanges. There are tons of them.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:00:54
Yes, that's right. They should simply take the dollars they have while their accounts aren't frozen and move them to Bitstamp, Kraken and so on. Also move all the other cryptocurreny. Then sell it all and put up a simple website where each user can enter a wallet address to receive their share in BTC. Could be done within two weeks. Everyone can move on. Bankruptcy 2.0.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:43:02
Actually, that is exactly what Barclays would do. It's called deposit insurance and in the current world you pay for it through your taxes.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:48:41
What if I only had BTC, but they were in a wallet that wasn't touched, why would I have to bleed for the Bitfinex hack? If you socialise losses, you socialise across the board, not some random subset.
If there is a bank robbery of your local Bank of America branch, the loss is made good using centralized deposit insurance, which everyone pays for. Not just the local branch depositors.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:31:29
Exactly my point. Also, I guess I should have said 100% stolen...
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:30:07
Quite the contrary. If they take a bite from everyone, they created... deposit insurance! The socialized loss minus whatever Finex chips in is the insurance premium.
Do you think your USD are safe if Finex creates a group of disgruntled losers? They will try to get those precious USD of yours through the courts and I bet you would be the first person to withdraw.
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:04:17
You talk about equity as if it were some kind of gold bar. The equity's value goes to exactly zero if the company goes into liquidation. The servers and offices are rented. What do you plan to "wipe out"?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:19:52
Hey [Zane]( I just took a walk, and then openend a new comment. Frankly, if you only half-socialise losses, I don't care how you put your site up, because then its all about getting funds out as fast as I can.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:32:17
yep. maybe 1 warm wallet and 5 separate wallets in five separate bank safes. that way max loss is 1/6.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:09:50
 &amp; BITFINEX: DON'T DO THIS. YOU ARE FUCKING YOURSELVES FOR GOOD!
Explanation: Finex is creating two sets of customers. Winners, who get shielded from Finex' incompetence, and Losers, who end up paying for Finex' incompetence.
LOSER POINT OF VIEW:
Wow, I get to pay, while every one else gets to party on. Let's see if we can't force Finex (in court) to hand over some of the Winner's funds...
WINNER POINT OF VIEW:
Oh shit, there are all these losers out there who want to get Finex' money, so how safe can our money be here? Furthermore, what if next time the ETC wallets are breached, who is gonna bail us out? Way to dangerous keeping my funds at Finex!
Hence, Finex is getting sued by the losers, while the winners take their business somewhere else. Finex' demise is guaranteed.
Finex shafts everyone equally. Instead of creating two antagonistic communities, you create one with a shared memory of surviving a bad situation. Also, everyone feels more comfortable leaving funds at Finex, because they now are INSURED by everyone else in case Finex' messes up again. Finex' survival is not guaranteed, but possible.
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE ?  THERE IS STILL TIME TO STOP YOUR SUICIDE.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:28:45
Well, the only other option is that they actually go bankrupt... how is that better?
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:19:06
IF Bitfinex wants to try to put the loses on individual accounts, that would have definitely worked if the hacker had used the front end to hack those accounts, i.e. if the hacker had obtained account credentials from individual users. But he didn't.
Putting such loses on individual "losers", would give them 60 million reasons to try to convince a Hong Kong or US court (not Italy, because there it takes forever) that it was Bitfinex who handed the private keys to the hacker and who lifted the withdrawal limits. In fact, I read Bitfinex statements that already admitted as much. On the other hand, we have the TOS, which say nothing is ever Bitfinex's fault. So the court may rule either way.
What are the "luckies" going to do in the meantime? Are they going to leave their coins on Bitfinex and wait for the court to decide? No, they will withdraw because of legal uncertainty, if Bitfinex lets them. If Bitfinex lets them withdraw before a court ruling, however, that may be criminal.
Hence, logic dictates that Bitfinex might put up a pretty page tomorrow with some numbers, but they can't let anyone withdraw until it is clear who is liable for the lost coins (the "losers" or Bitfinex). In fact, people who fear they might get bailed-in should file an injunction against any withdrawals ASAP.
Logically, then, there are only two options:
1. Bitfinex manages to  find a white knight to scrape together enough cash to make everyone at least fairly whole. They probably are trying right now.
2. Bitfinex goes doesn't find the money fast. Who wants to spend 60 million on a coin exchange on the verge of bankruptcy? In that case, they could save a lot of time and money by converting all their assets to BTC and handing every user their portion, minus whatever the loss works out to be. The beauty for Bitfinex is that then there is nothing left to sue against so everyone can get on with their lives. I can't imagine anyone getting their knickers in a twist if they lose 10-20%. This is crypto, after all.
I think that is about all there is. White knight within the next few days, failing that, a quick haircut bankruptcy for everyone, or worst case a protracted bankruptcy if Bitfinex attempts to bail in individual users.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:16:47
Yeah, I will trade there, too. Just won't keep quite as much funds there again, distribute it to other exchanges, too.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:53:48
It is not fraudulent. It is done openly and you are free to challenge it in court. You thereby push them into bankruptcy and once there, all assets are pooled, so you have the same loss distribution. Then you wait five years and you get back 36% instead of 64%, since lawyers and interim managers are shit expensive.
They also never hid their losses, so they did nothing criminal at all. They just fucked up, which is what happens in business.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:48:17
You need to stop thinking about legal issues and first think about the economic point of view of EVERYONE involved. Yes, I also would like to get free shares of some company, but those whom you take them from have then no reason to continue the company, so they can threaten you to take the company to bankruptcy if you threaten to take away their shares.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:50:13
If you think they are such crooks, why did you do business with them in the first place? These are the same people that you were happy dealing with just a week ago. Crook also implies they somehow cheated, but that you need to proof. Only their incompetence has been established so far.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:09:40
I know everyone here is playing nice right now, because nobody knows yet whom Bitfinex is going to fuck over. Playing nice is a typical strategy employed by people whose balls are in a vice. But once the deed is done and people see the loss manifested in their balances, all hell will break lose. Especially since Bitfinex seems to play by the "oh its individual wallets so it's the individual customer losses"-crap. Watch this space get nasty.
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:44:38

It will take a while for BTC to get off the ground. At the moment, the established currencies are doing their job for day-to-day business well. 
Today BTC can serve as a medium to long term value store for that part of your wealth that you do not plan to spend ad hoc. Medium to long term, volatility does not hurt you and BTC has the advantage of lacking arbitrary devaluation drivers (central banks). 
BTC as day-to-day currency will come by when the quality of existing fiat deteriorates to a point where people are feeling forced to spend cash NOW because it maybe visibly less valuable in a few months.
BTC lovers don't worry, that day will come sooner than you think.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:45:29
I think it's best to keep our cool. The disaster in Iraque, the Ukraine crises, negative interest rates in Europe, FED financing the US gov't, the Chinese real estate bubble... the list goes on and on and on. 
We can rely with absolute certainty on the fact, that all governments that issue their own paper currencies to support their fantasy economies will eventually hit rock bottom. 
Some non-fiat money will have to be used by anyone wishing to engage in indirect exchange. It will either be gold or cryptocurrency. Compared to crypto, gold is shit. Just buy some and you will see what I mean. It's a total pain in the ass.
Hence we are left with crypto. Bitcoin is a simple, proven algorithm that just works. Bitcoin today is 33 times bigger than Ripple, the current number two. Since it is in the nature of a currency that people eventually use only one currency (unless gov'ts force them to act otherwise), Bitcoin is the absolute favorite to survive and thrive. Just wait and see.

The protocol should not be changed at all. I know core developers feel a natural urge to "develop" and "fix", but Bitcoin is finished. It just works, and people trust it the way it is. That is its value.
It is not necessary for the protocol to handle gazillions of transactions. For the greatest number of convenience payments, third party clearing houses (Bitpay, etc...) can do a perfectly fine job.
For example, if I need to spend or receive many fast micropayments, I absolutely do not need every single, tiny payment to be recorded on the blockchain. Just like a VISA card, I can use a clearing company, which uses a single wallet for all its customers, both buyers and sellers of goods, and an off-chain database recording which customer owns how many coins in the single clearing wallet. Only when a customer wishes to transfer money outside of the clearing house is an actual blockchain transaction required.
With time, this will lead to the existence of a few dominant clearing houses that people use for everyday transactions. This is not at all a bad thing, since only trusted and fair clearing companies will succeed in the long-term, much like VISA and MasterCard. So people will simply have a private savings wallet, where they keep the majority of their wealth, but which they use only for large and rare transactions, while they keep a fast and easy to use online clearing wallet as their current account, whose transactions do not have to be recorded on the blockchain.
If the core developers would please begin to trust the markets to find solutions and just stop doing anything, we will all be fine.
@_date: 2016-02-14 17:32:55
The first part of your comment is definitely wrong, the last sentence may be correct. I will reply to the first, wrong part and think about the last sentence of your comment some more.
Bank profits are outsized because banks can create money out of thin air using a monopoly granted to them by the govt.  Furthermore, bank profits are supported by the fact that governments are effectively guaranteeing to bail out banks that lends recklessly as long as the bank is very large, creating incentives to have very large banks. Further, in a half-assed attempt to control their banks, the govts also force banks to comply to large amounts of regulations. In any industry, regulation leads to centralization, because per dollar revenue it is cheaper for the big players to comply with regulations than it is for the small players. This keeps competition away which increases profits for the established big players.
None of the above applies to BTC, thank god. In case of BTC, more mining profits means more miners, less centralization as in any other un-regulated industry.
Concerning the distribution of mining fees: currently, the freshly minted coins make up 99% of miner profit. But do not forget, that will change as the reward is halved every four years. Soon, miners must rely more on tx fees. If those fees are too low, more and more miners will have to give up.
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:43:12
I am not saying the miners will give out anything for free, but they will include any paying transaction in the new block.
Imagine you are a miner and you just solved the hash. You have a list of 1000 transactions each paying 1 satoshi and the block can fit 1000 or more transactions. In that case you will definitely include all the transactions, because not doing so would mean you make less money on the given block that you "own" now. Worse, if you only include 800 txs, that gives an extra 200paying transactions to the next block. Especially those miners that are on the margin cannot afford to leave money on the table, they always have to take any transaction they can get. The users know that, so they never offer more than 1 satoshi.

My argument is not at all about whether banks are good or bad. Of course banks are "good", because they render many useful services.
Our discussion was about centralisation. As long as regulation and subsidies are absent, every competitor plays on a a level playing field and an increase in profits will attract new competitors, which in case of BTC leads to increase hash power and *falling* profits.
I can assure you, that many people are worried about the dollar, manifested in a gold price of 1235 USD. 
Rewards **will** go to **zero** and miners must eventually rely on fees. If blocks can have virtually unlimited transactions, then economic logic dictates that users will offer 1 satoshi per transaction, rendering most mining operations unprofitable *unless* miners impose an artifical limit. But, competitors will never agree to a limit, because what is unprofitable for one miner, can still be profitable for another. Therefore profits will fall freely until only one miner is left, who would then be in a place to impose tx limits. 
**That** is the issue.

You don't seem to understand how currencies work. Whether its dollar, euro, gold or BTC, the more people HOLD an item, the more they value it. When they get rid of an item, they say: well, I value the other thing that I just exchanged my currency item for more than the currency item. 
For example, gold is extremely valuable even though almost nobody ever goes out and buys anything with it.
You should read up on economics before calling basic economic statements "nonsense".

The basic feature of currency is, that it cannot be easily forged. Only after that is assured, do you think about transaction costs. Nobody said you cannot buy normal things with BTC, you just should just pay the fee. So, it could be that the fees become larger than the value of that coffee, but then you would still buy a TV or such with it. 
My point is that you can either have a free or virtually free transactions or a save store of value, for which you then have to pay up a little.

DONT FORK. KEEP BLOCKSIZE SMALL.
The reluctance of many miners to back forks that increase block size is likely based on profit considerations. Keeping the blocksize small incentives BTC users to pay transaction fees for urgent transactions, which go right to the bottom line of the miners.
This is a good thing, because it increases miners' incentive to keep competing by increasing their hash power, which in turn increases forgery protection. Remember that the giant, ASIC-based hash power behind BTC makes it the most secure digital ledger on this planet, which is the single most important feature holders of BTCs require (if they think about it for minute).
The value of BTC increases only as long as people hoard (i.e. hold, i.e remain long) BTC. But when you hoard currency over a longer period, security (not convenience) becomes the most important concern.
So, it would be in the best interest of anyone here who holds significant amounts of BTC and anyone here who mines BTC to reconsider supporting forks that increase the blocksize.
Those who think BTC is about paying for latte macchiatos at Starbucks should find some worthless "EasyPeasyCoin" to spend. Oh, we already got that. It's called dollar.

Hi Major Payne,
I thought about this issue some more and here is my concern:
Rewards *will* go to *zero* eventually and miners must then rely on fees. If blocks can have virtually unlimited transactions, then economic logic dictates that users will offer 1 satoshi per transaction, rendering most mining operations unprofitable unless miners impose an artificial limit. But, as long as miner remain competitors they will never agree to a limit, because what is unprofitable for one miner, can still be profitable for another. Therefore profits *will* fall freely until only one miner is left, who would then be in a place to impose any fees he likes.
**That** is my point. Do you concur?
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:47:14
I read your comment twice before replying, but maybe I didn't understand your point : )
I will think about what you said just now.

Fees are not subsidies. When a dentist performs a service, he is paid a fee in exchange for the service. That's not a subsidy. When a car manufacturer sells a car, he collects a fee (called "sales price"). That's not a subsidy. When a miner provides proof-of-work and includes your transaction in the next block, he gets a fee for doing so. That's not a subsidy. 
A subsidy is paid regardless of service rendered. 
Don't play word games...

If miners included all transactions, people would have no reason to pay for them, reducing mining profits. Only when miners are restrictive will people have an incentive to pay, and only then can miners continue to run their expensive mining operations, which is what ensures network security.

Despite of their statements, the great majority of miners ignore XT and Classic. Don't judge people by what they say, judge them by what they do. People always act in their own self-interest (since they don't really now what anyone elses interests are) and it seems that miners' self interest as manifested in their actions is to keep out large-block forks.
Don't worry about the actual size of the transaction fee. The market process will discover fees based on the actions of all BTC users.

Please meditate on the following:
"When you go to WalMart, you are selling dollars"
Lots of people forget there or two side to every transaction. When you buy a TV, you are selling BTC. All other things being equal, what you sell is less valuable to you than the thing you get in return. When you are asking people to "buy things" with BTC, you are telling them to sell their BTC. This is equivalent to asking them to put less value on BTC. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:32:11
That is not correct. Once there are more transactions than can be included in a single block, miners will have to choose which transactions to include in the block right now, and which to leave for later. Of course, they will choose the transactions that pay more over those that pay less or nothing, which will increase their income per block.
Paying for blockchain security incentives is not "friction".
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:03:54
There is no requirement for a minimum transaction limit.

Okay, but:
Note that higher profits DO NOT lead to more mining centralization,  but exactly the opposite. The higher the profit margin in a given business, the greater the incentive for new competitors to enter the business, which in case of BTC means more new hash power held by more different entities.
I also disagree with your second point as it is self contradictory. If we really already had secure (non-forgeable) AND cheap (low tx cost) currencies, we wouldn't need BTC, would we?
Third point. No, the security (non-forgeability) of BTC depends on mining power, which costs money to deploy and run. The decision is exactly about security vs. tx costs.
