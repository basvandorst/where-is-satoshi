They've been buying it for some time, they just have to dump it and crush the price right before contracts expiration. Is it so hard to wrap this shit around your silly head? omfg. On the other hand - Bitfinnex will pump empty tethers for it not to happen. Shit is getting interesting...
" show me how they stand to make any money by tanking the price" so you never heard before about shorting stocks? I seee...

"it costs about $15M to buy all the btc within $1k" folks that shorted it knew exactly what they were doing. Do you really think they just shorted it and kept their fingers crossed just like most of the HODLers here? Nope, they already have enought BTC to make their profit tomorrow ;). Also, folks that short BTC has an unlimited FIAT supply trough FED channels.

Nice one. I love some red pills in the Monday afternoon. Great Info, Just like AK-47 based of STG-44 and designed by Hugo schmeisser, who was captured by Soviets "op paperclip" and not Kalashnikov. We are living in the matrix of the false history
