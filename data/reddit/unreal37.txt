I guess it makes some sense from their perspective. There are probably a small number of users that make them most of their profits. So they pay back their most profitable users first, AND pay back all the people with 0.0001 BTC who will make a lot of noise complaining over pennies.

Also it's common for new currencies themselves to bribe exchanges with their own currency to list them. This puts the power to bribe in the hands of users as well.

You want a bitcoin ATM machine installed in your office? Just for yourself to use? 
I think you need a high traffic location like a cafe. Doubt you can just ask them to install it in a private location.

Why do you think "use a Visa card everywhere" is the most underreported story in bitcoin? It's a Visa card. Visa spends BILLIONS per year on advertising. Everyone already uses a Visa card everywhere. 
I genuinely don't understand what's so special about that site. It's what 99% of businesses accept already.

Your name is not Satoshi. There - eliminated.
One interesting logical fallacy I haven't seen mentioned yet. The fact that his name is Satoshi seems to be 50% of her proof. (The other 50% is his "no longer involved" denial.) But she was only looking for Satoshi's so of course she found one. 50% of her proof was established before she started looking.

Re: "A donation implies that the money will be spent..."
Almost everywhere in the world, a donation does not imply that at all. You lose control of the money once you hand it over. If you donate $1,000 to your church of choice, do you know how long they kept that money before spending? Do you care? 
I am not sure why everyone cares so much what is done with site ad revenue and donations.

And you reminded me about my old Deepbit account. Had almost a whole bitcoin in there. Thanks!
