Still wrong. Bitcoin IS disinfationary, at least currently, assuming that the rate of fresh BTC mining is higher than the rate of BTC being lost.

Just out of curiosity, what was the withdrawal fee?

But why is there FUD? Fear of regulation of crypto?? This is effing impossible for real crypto, any noob who knows 2 things about it knows that.
The problem is that a big chunk of the volume is traders &amp; their bots, and most traders apparently don't have a clue of what true crypto is. They sell, reacting to news of Trump's dumb-ass tweet like we're in the 90s. Bunch of nonsense. 
People need to be educated. Educate your friends &amp; family, don't let them treat crypto as an investment vehicle, a get-rich-quick scheme. More people need to see the big picture.
I am not a trader, nor am I crying about the price because I want to make a couple bucks. I just feel sad seeing one of the best weeks in terms of crypto-acceptance &amp; adoption pass and almost nobody giving a shit.

I would have expected major pomps &amp; domps through the weekend after the crazy week that passed in terms of BTC/Crypto news with Congress and all...I guess it might be the calm before the storm - in this case, people waiting for their deposits to be credited in exchanges before letting it rip.

I just can't fathom how the price is so stable these last few days. We had such turmoil last week and so many good pieces of news that should trigger some pomps &amp; domps but instead we are going through the most stable, in terms of price, period of the last two months.

Nice post. Let's hope the "smart money" is indeed smart.

Welcome to the show!
Just fyi, this is far from a “run” for bitcoin’s standards.

I'm over 50% invested in BTC, and when I see 1k dips, which I rarely do in real time because I do not check the price often, I don't even twitch. True believers don't see bitcoin's price as an investment performance indicator.
The only reason I ever check price history is curiosity, as I find its correlation with political &amp; financial developments and various other pieces of news interesting and a good measure of what's to come and when in our space.
Bitcoin is here to stay, and is only going up. Fuck the price.

**Laziness** \- too lazy to pick up a fucking book and read it (that's all it takes)
**Fear of the unknown** \- and no will to make it known
**Fear of breaking away from the herd** \- "if my rich friends aren't doing it, why should I?, I don't want to be singled-out as the village's fool if this goes bust"
**Blind Trust in Family** \- "If my dad says it is a scam, it must be so"
**Greed (&amp; short-sightedness)** \- "It already went from 1 to 10,000$, I missed the boat on that one"

Such brainwash only works on low IQ individuals. And they are irrelevant.
Unfortunately, the real issue is human nature; this is what transforms the mid/high IQ individuals to sheep.

I like how the highlighting line is almost like a graph, with red on the downswing which deletes credit and green on the upswing to the Moon

Welcome back Bitcoin, we missed you the last couple of weeks..
HODL ON BOIZZ

I'm Greek. I don't see why anyone would want to buy BTC using a debit card instead of using a traditional bank transfer from a Greek bank account to any exchange's bank account or any peer's bank account from [LocalBitcoins.com]( etc.
If you wish to pay \~ 6-8% fees for buying BTC with your debit card then I hope it works out for you in the future; I will continue to buy BTC using SEPA bank transfers paying 0 fees.
That said, I consider your thread's title very misleading. In fact, the outgoing bank transfer limit that was imposed by the previously set capital controls for guys like you and me, specifically 4000 Euro per 2 months, is now lifted.
Many more limits have also been lifted for all types of transactions and transfers of money. I'm not buying that this means we're now out of the recession and our economy will grow exponentially and all this bullcrap of course. However, seeing today's news of Argentina imposing their own capital controls I'm at least grateful that we seem to be headed to the right direction.
