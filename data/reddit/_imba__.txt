I have respect for the values of btc but that is an impressive amount of fallacies to fit into one tweet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:22:32
Thanks for the time taken to answer this in detail. I must say, I find the reason to defer strange considering the state of things, but no point shooting the messenger.

Could you explain why blockchain increase degrades the security?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:13
What’s up with this though? I don’t understand why adoption is so slow, segwit should help the stupid fees.  Is it hard to upgrade, or is there some other issue limiting adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:15:15
I have absolutely no issue with anything in your comment, those are all very fair and legitimate comments I think, but the tweet itself is still more than a little dodgy in it’s hyperbole and self-righteously even if this is the sentiment he was trying to get over.

Since you're probs replying to a bunch of messages and in a few debates, first a disclaimer: I 'm not particularly loyal to any coin or technology, definitely not bch although I do still own a few of them. Purely interested in some crypto winning, whatever that ends up looking like. I'm not particularly bound to any of my thoughts around this. I'm a noob on a lot of the finer details.


Yes I know, I meant that in context of the rest of that sentence. I was trying to describe a situation where the backlog grows until it ceases up and the price spikes. Which is where the efficiency will come into question, and the core argument for bigger blocks. Purely saying that is the situation where the efficiency likely stops being better than a larger block, SegWit and all (and yes I know the limit we are talking about will be higher with SegWit).


The bigger the network gets the more inefficient and uneducated any node will be, so while that might be true btc is/was just at a size where adoption and lags need to be part of the decision making. I'm not sure it's useful to blame the network and I'm not sure what the solution is. Any product is only as good as its adoption at the end of the day, that's part of the problem that needs to be solved.


I'm mostly just chatting about the claims you made, you brought up the costs, so this bit is a little random ;). 
That said, btc adoption is the metric, not some other thing. Ie if you can get growth and usage on the network you're winning and if not you try to see what is wrong. Lower fees are by far the easiest way to get growth at the moment, given how it's currently used (trading, basically/unfortunately). I just care about usage so low fees on small transactions seems a decent enough thing to chase for me. With that you can create a few real-world hotspots and sell coffee and shit to get people in the habbit of using it. Alternatively, with higher fees you probably need to look at cross-border remittance as the most viable target. While a valuable product that just seems harder.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:21:56
Per block can't be right... You'd need to take blocksize into account, no? Isn't the pure median transaction fee a better proxy if you want to compare fees? PS I've never seen fork.lol, what a great tool :)
edit: [link to relevant bitinfocharts here](
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:54:26
Ah ok right, the bch blocks are basically empty so sat/b will be higher even with lower median. 
The other take away for me from your comment is the argument is that byte for byte btc will be cheaper because of SegWit and other (future) optimizations, which I buy to some extent. I assume at a point that part will become false or shakey if the blocks are full again and the backlog grows as it did end 2016 (just because fees will go up), but even then we would only be able to compare if bch had the same amount of transactions at that point, which obvs won't happen.
Anyway. Apples and hypothetical oranges.

This might be the dumbest thing I’ve read today. Any dev that doesn’t follow the simplest solution to the problem is making a mistake. Anyone insulting a dev solution by calling it lazy isn’t a dev or really fucking shouldn’t be. ‘Works’ means nothing if users and merchants don’t adopt the solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:59:02
Go read some dev books, sarcasm works better if you know what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:44:21
Yeah thats a blatant naive bug, not a feature.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:34:50
I kinda expect the other thread to criticize btc considering the history, but I still find it really strange when this thread attacks/criticizes bitcoin cash. Not that much to gain IMO. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:01:52
As optimistic as I am about future price, that article is absolute junk.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:30:27
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:18:29
No matter how much you love bitcoin, this is fucking stupid. Another name on the list of morons to ignore.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:56:10
Fair. Ranting works better if you use the right words.
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:15:54
I'm no expert on the subject, but doesn't that lead to major centralisation through gmail-like services? In which case, what's the point? A service doesn't need this it can use it's own ledger and batch settle btc.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:58:29
I used to only subscribe to the other thread. Came here mostly to level out the overzealous hype on that side after the split. Really hard to figure out exactly where things stand if you're only on one thread at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:56:18
Isn't that just true for anything new in cryptos? All exciting things in the space are untested theories to some extent.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:08:48
This is one of the key points that caused the fork. The other coin that resulted is focussed on low fees (bitcoin cash), but have their own set of issues, centralisation being a big one. All in all a pretty strange time for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:40:47
Or he just read some things on the btc sub (or he just has another account)? Anyone who legitimately answers his questions are met with decent replies. No need to always fall back on trolling as a reason.

Outcome bias
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:35:19


I mean even if that is the case their best bet is to increase adoption as much as possible initially, especially if they have funding, which they do. So that leads to more conspiracies around bank funding and things like that.


Yes, definitely. It's an open source project though. I'm not sure where the lines between control and contribution lie, but I tend to stay out of that argument since I don't feel like I know enough about it.


That's incredibly hard to answer, but I'm guessing with what we currently know we can easily triple or quadruple up on-chain, and will then need to start looking at introducing convenience side chains etc. BUT the technology is still in infancy if you ask me. There's so much space to grow in every direction.


Again, BTC is open source, so it's feasible. It's supposed to be able to change and improve as we learn new things IF that is the will of the community. So the question becomes: what will the contributors and community decide if such technologies become available.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:50:18


That's a tricky one. To oversimplify the argument, it's that if you keep increasing the block size it causes massive problems at some point. 
This is, of course, a blatant slippery slope fallacy, so some groups came to the conclusion that there is another real reason, and that is the forcing of side-chains for profit. 
I personally believe that the conspiracy is bullshit and that the devs just (incorrectly, in my opinion) focussed on the longterm solution first. That's the kind of choice I see many amazing devs I know choose often.
I personally would have loved to see the limit increased to a sensible level while they continue their work on side chains and other longer-term solutions.
I think a big problem you'll find with btc is that people demonize any other opinions with all kinds of theories, instead of at least trying to understand it. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:09:01
Read all the words.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:00:25
You know, I'd actually love to see a good-hearted small block vs big(ger) block btc experiment. Too bad for all the sleaziness in this fight.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:31:39
What’s the ETA for lightning,? Soon is such a scary word in dev projects.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:59:26
Fair, but it feels a little artificial at this point, could happen much closer to a point where it is actually problematic without putting unnecessary strain on the blocks. Maybe I’m a little paranoid but I think there’s a massive chance of full blocks and the shitstorm that follows before a release date for lightning is even set.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:53:17
I don’t care much for the childish tribalism, and I’m not a fan of Ver either. Tbf both sides have some shady mascots at the moment. That said bigger blocks is a pretty damn good solution to current bitcoin woes like high fee slow transactions. Lightning sounds pretty cool as a long term plan but why not just do something to improve the current situation. It could work along side it np. I hate this binary mindset so much.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:20:10
I personally think complaining about coinbase's shitty spam isn't worth it. Tech can't try to force product into a direction in 2019, product and usage should force tech in a direction, given a clear goal. What I mean is that I believe to truly grow in any market you need to make some concessions according to data - the obvious one here being that your intermediate platforms are going to be pretty unoptimised for a while and forcing them to optimise isn't working. 
This is a pretty contentious issue so I don't think it's weird that it's being debated again. I guess the point of people getting up to speed with the debate and the tech is fair. Telling people to move to bitcoin cash is a lil strange to me though. Everyone wants bitcoin to do well, since it's a complex beast there will be differing opinions on how to let that happen.
Controversial opinion: I'd personally love blocks that could be moved up to about 10mb by config. I guess I don't believe demand will just grow infinitely. From my back of the envelope calculations  I think it will basically always cap out at a sensible number, even in bull runs. 
That means LN can have the chance to be trailed without all this delusional and over-invested expectation. I personally don't think LN will solve all the cases for small transactions, the experience is too specific and not worth it for intra-platform payments.  Putting all eggs into one basket (one that is also really slow to prove any hypothesis at scale!) is unnecessary if the goal is growth in uncertain circumstances.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:27:45
LN won't work well for this case (even if it was ready). But they can easily do batch settlement, so hopefully they'll do that.
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:56:15
Looking at his history he's very likely just joking yeah.
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:46:19
It was the lightning devs that said it was 18 months away. And there’s nothing wrong with a difficult project taking some time. At the moment it isn’t ready for production, so why would the markets react 30btc isn’t a lot in the greater scheme of things? It’s still some way off.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:47:57
...well that's enough reddit for today.

I wanted to get the views of people closer to the action than me.  It at least kinda looks like things are starting to move in the right direction vs a while back. I'm hoping one day your comment won't be true any more, but I guess we'll see.
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:09:05
I've heard this before but I really don't get why low velocity of money enhance value in a deflationary system per se, basic economics or not, I don't buy that it needs to be fundimental outside of traditional fiat model. Can you explain?
