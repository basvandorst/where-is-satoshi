Most of the ways you mentioned charge up to 20% in fees. Even localbitcoins, the sellers always ask a premium. An established exchange is the cheapest way to get it. 
And once u bought your btc why would you store it binance if you're not interested in shitcoin? Why not just move it to your hardware wallet which is 1000x safer. You're making no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:25:03
It's not hard at all for an accounting firm to just see and verify if they have capitalized tether as they say. It's prob beyond your skill set, but to them it's like asking a neurosurgeon to treat an ingrown toenail.

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:40:55
I don't know about that. Seems every piece of negative news causes it to crash. Which means it doesn't have a solid HODL support above 10k. What would cause btc to rise (slowly over time) and stay high is actual practical use and steady prices. All this volatility means no one really wants to use it as a payment method so it remains in the wild wild west.

WRONG, nice try pulling facts out of your ass.
direct from gemini website :
Are my funds FDIC-insured?
US DOLLARS
Yes, U.S. dollars in your Gemini account are eligible for FDIC insurance, subject to applicable limitations.
 
DIGITAL ASSETS
No, at this time the U.S. government does not insure any Digital Assets (e.g. Bitcoin or Ether) deposits, however, we are heavily capitalized to protect the Digital Assets that you store with us. In addition, we are insured by a top-tier insurance company to protect you from internal malfeasance.
That does not mean your coins are insured against external malfeasance!

I doubt it in the long term, right now yes cause everyone is talking about it and it's in the media all the time, but a few years from now? But diamonds are heavily coveted for their beauty, and larger diamonds even more so. U are correct about price manipulation, but at the end of the day there is no substitute for gems and precious metals. Where as in btc, people have many options , including abandoning it. But the intrinsic lust for precious metals and gems is ingrained in our DNA somehow. It's lasted thousand and thousands of years.

@_date: 2018-01-18 22:11:54
to be honest, its more of a commodity than a currency. you cant really buy anything with it, not easy to use, fees are insane. but as a commodity it works. like gold. except that gold is something you can touch and feel and wear, btc is just a sequence of 0s and 1s.
i think eventually there will be a virtual currency, thats super fast and cheap transactions, and its backing will be btc. like how the gold standard was.
so i issue say 1 billion supercoins, and its backing is my 1 million btc. ssomething like that
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:49:11

Why don't u read the whole thread, u have an attention span of a child. Op was offering binance as an alternative to Coinbase. And it's not a viable alternative as they don't deal in fiat. They would still need yet another exchange to buy btc with fiat unless they are stupid enough to pay 20% premium on a $40,000 order which is the money allegedly stuck at Coinbase. If he had mentioned gemini or kraken then it's another debate. But binance? NO.

it just shows the volatility of cryptocurrency. any negative news affects the mindset, and there isnt strong enough support to counteract a severe dip. 
unlike USD, where say negative news about the USA doesnt have too much effect on the price, unless it's something disastrous and major. Like in the UK the british pound dropped 30% after news that brexit passed. but rumours and speculation doesnt affect the price much, unlike bitcoin, where rumours can cause it to drop 30% and real disastrous news can cause it to drop further.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:06:18
No way
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:59:24
But a well known accounting firm should handle this particular case easily. They don't have to audit the whole of bitfinex, or even the cryptocurrencies, it's just 1 aspect. It should be straightforward for them. Bitfinex does not want to be audited, plain and simple
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:38:40

theres 2 concepts here, one is the blockchain technology, which allows transferring things like btc across vast global networks securely.
2nd is the use of this tech as a currency and payment system that is not controlled by any 1 govt, or banks or payment services. so i can send u my currency regardless where i am, or where you are, and no 3rd party gets involved in our business.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:17:01

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:15:44
I believe in the technology, and it's future applications. I don't believe in its current value. It should be around 5k and rise slowly and gradually. Yes it can reach 20k again, but not for a few years and not in its current state.

Only the fiat currency is insured. People can still hack into your account buy btc and send it out. If it's a system wide hack and your fiat is gone then you can get it back. But not your coins.

@_date: 2018-01-20 07:27:33
if you are quick and not dealing in large amounts it should be ok. just dont leave your money as tether for long, change to btc and get it out of the exchange. during a crash its a good way to protect yourself by changing to tether until market recovers.
overall its a good idea, but i dont trust bitfinex has actually capitalized $1 for every tether they issue. they are not transparent about it, which leads me to believe they are issuing 2 - 3X more tether than usd they have. which means it could fall apart very quickly. and also tether is not FDIC insured.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:24:51

@_date: 2018-01-26 15:43:37
Not an expert but only declare what you convert into fiat. I don't know if the UK recognises Bitcoin as an asset and it's value is quite volatile. Basically if you never convert into fiat and HODL I doubt you'd have to declare anything. But I'm not sure, so call your tax office and ask them about cryptocurrency.

They are not based out of Hong Kong. I visited their 'office' in HK and there was only 1 employee, a secretary, and she said she manages like 20 companies. Apparently it's just an address to handle mail etc. I left her my email because I wanted my account to be verified. I got a reply from the CEO of bitfinex saying that they do not have an office in Hong Kong and this information is misrepresented by the media. Luckily my ac was never verified. I'm very happy with local exchange based in HK which I used instead.

i just cashed out my initial investment, and am left with around 15k worth of btc which is pure profit. its only stressful if you bought in late, or invested too much. otherwise its a great hobby.
i find fiat far more stressful, because to make it worthwhile you have to leverage quite a bit, which makes it almost as volatile as btc. unless you dont leverage and play long term, which is boring as hell
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:01:36
That's why I stated I'm not an expert and everyone should do their due diligence. And contacting your local tax office is a good start. The rest is just an opinion. And also what if he has mined the coin? That doesn't involve any trading.

Lightning is nowhere near ready and it has a bunch of problems still to work out. Increased volume won't come back unless some amazing news comes out. We saw a lot of speculators enter the market in Dec, and it seems a lot of them have exited by now. Some are still holding but if more bad news comes then we looking at 5k for a long time.  The hype has died down, the volume came from the hype.

So in essence any kind of capital gain in the USA is taxed?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:02:18
It's all about leveraging and shorting. Ie invest $1 to buy $10 worth of coin. But if the price falls to say $9 you lose your $1. But if the price goes to $13 you've made $2 on a $1 investment. The reverse scenario is also possible, that's called shorting. But you're not really buying any coin. Just betting on the price.

even tho they think its a bubble, it has nothing to do with the profitability (at least in the medium term) of running an exchange. in fact, its extremely profitable! they make money off of fees (which i am sure they convert to fiat), they themselves are not speculating on the coin. just as a supermarket profits regardless of the price of oranges. but yes ofcourse, if bitcoin crashes to &lt;1000 and the volume drops to near 0, then it may be time to close the exchange, but in the mean time, there is tons of money to be made.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:32:06
Probably FOMO and hype leading to over speculation and the expected resulting correction which started at 20k and is shown through the numerous technical analysis charts with indicators like bear pennant formation and the death cross, low volume buying along with no new institutional money coming in leading to the eventual decline into 5k or 3k or 2.5k. if you think we are at the bottom you are in for a shock. But this has happened before and it may very well rise to newer highs, but let go of HODL mentality right now and buy back when u see very low volatility, it will take years to recover. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:18:10

what happened was something called Slippage. they sold at a high price, but such a large quantity, that it actually affected the price (negatively). it ate up all the order book entries down. this caused a panic and made the price drive down even more. basically its the opposite of a pump. and btc is very hard to pump due to the value and volume required. so u can imagine the amounts they were selling.

i wonder if it will bounce back again this time, or the bottom will fall out...........either way, i think my lambo is gone :(

I think since it's a trustee, they have to follow court orders. Some payment deadline was due and they had to dump a ton of Bitcoin, this caused slippage. Or they thought the price would crash further and they had to sell to meet a deadline so they couldn't wait for the rebound.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:25:33
Whatever the reason, if you look at the charts, there is a pattern called a bear pennant that has formed. Which shows the trajectory target is around 4000. However there is considerable support at the 61% Fibonacci which is around 7400-7800 which will be VERY hard to puncture without considerable volume.

But why is etherium also following btc. It's constantly staying around 10% of btc
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:59:55
This is just my opinion but for the current atmosphere I would break down my portfolio as such: 60% btc, 30% eth, 10% various solid altcoins. But as the year goes on increase eth and decrease btc.

This is a high risk product so of course these fluctuations are expected. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:50:33
sure, sounds interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:51:57
It's strange because all exchanges that accept fiat have USD/eth pairing. And eth movements were pretty independent of btc, soaring to 1400 while btc was stagnant. Then came the crash in Jan and ever since then it's following btc even though it has its own fiat pairing.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:56
7k cost. but fuck it, even if it slides to 7k i wont sell.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:47:58
The problem with usdt is that it is not fiat and it's real value probably is not 1:1 and you can't convert usdt directly into USD.

i think with creativity, vision, innovation, risk-taking, profits WILL come in the longer term. Just look what happened this week, Tesla posted a US$ 2.2 billion loss and its stock went up 10% as a result!! People are buying it for it's vision and potential to disrupt the current markets, and they know profits will come with it. Very similar to the bitcoin story.

The only time altcoins soar is when btc is stable. If btc is crashing, they will crash worse. If btc is mooning, everyone dumps and hold btc.  The only exception is eth which has its own fiat pairing, but that too has been following btc move for move. Which is really wierd cause eth is severely undervalued at around 10% of btc.

NASA was once a beacon of hope, innovation, ingenuity, creativity, but just like all the other innovations in recent times, its up to the private sector to lead the way. the US govt is nothing more than a cesspool of selfish, corrupt politicians, who do nothing but serve themselves instead of the people. Times have changed.

It all depends on how much you invested compared to your net worth. If it's only a few percent and you r in the red the by all means HODL (just write it off). If you were reckless then you should save your ass and cut your losses otherwise it may very well impact your life.

thats totally true, if people are feel like buying, they'll do it regardless. if people are feeling like selling, they too will sell regardless. the news only reinforces their intentions so they actually pull the trigger. both ways.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:04:45
the problem would be pulling out all that money. you would have to do it very slowly and gradually, but at the same time running the risk that another whale who bought a lot while it was rising doesnt dump, cause all your profits to go to zero and then some.

i dont think there are many issues with trading in itself. ofcourse there is a slight learning curve regarding limit, market, stop limit, stop loss, maker vs taker etc..
the bigger issues cant be solved by an app:
1) wire transaction problems, ie bank issues, deposits not confirmed etc..
2) system lag during periods of heavy trading
3) security issues regarding storage of coins on exchange and risk of hacking
4) the time it takes to send bitcoin to a wallet and how to calculate fees etc..
what i do notice is many altcoins are paired with btc, and for some people this is confusing, they just want to see a dollar amount. since usd pairings to many alt coins are not possible, this is probably what scares away many people from buying altcoins. also which altcoins a particular exchange lists is an issue as well.
like if the avg joe hears about stellar lumens and wants to buy it, he has to find the right exchange, somehow get verified (to send fiat) then buy btc or (god forbid) USDT or eth, then buys xlm...

Yes totally agree, I wasn't criticising the scientists at NASA , more of a criticism of the govt 
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:00:05
this is mainly due to demand, when demand decreases, people are less willing to pay the 15% premium, so arbitrage sellers become more desperate and sell at a lower premium. because demand is quite low at the moment, its already good you are getting 5%, which shows there is still better demand in india than at other places. arbitrage opportunity in korea went from 25% to almost 0%. same with indonesia and hong kong. i am sure, in india it will go down to 2 -3% max soon.
however if btc becomes crazy hyped and popular again, then premiums will increase back to 15% or more.

even the internet, was limited to nerds at the time, then came netscape. mp3s were limited to pirates, then came itunes. noobroom was limited to pirates, then came netflix. napster was limited to pirates, then came spotify. bitcoin or blockchain in general needs something similar, and it will come to bring it mainstream.

I dont think bitfinex intentions are to scam. But they got greedy. Offering USD deposits through a shady payment processor that has probably laundered millions, intentionally or unintentionally,  trading usd pairs , on a volatile asset, in an unregulated market, with margin, yea ofcourse the US will seize your usd. Printing tether to get around this, so people don't have to kyc or use the dreaded usd (which can be siezed) is not and will not work long term. And also I guarantee, that if you do a proper independent audit , even 74% is too high a number. They will use tricks like projected valuation and asset valuation to show they have the cash but that's not the same thing as pure 1:1 backing of usd against usdt. And these people are smart, they have seen this coming, so maybe thats where the scam lies. Stop being greedy and lending your coins to earn "interest" and move them offsite asap.
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:52:01
Many people are lending their coins to margin traders, this is the main reason people dont move their coins offsite. Active traders actually make a small percentage of the user base. Ie 100 btc and above.
