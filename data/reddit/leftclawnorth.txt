If it was safe then how were you scammed?

Mycelium's fee estimate was accurate. 79 sat/b submitted at 10:45 pm EST would have confirmed within 2 blocks. 7 sat/b still hasn't confirmed as of 1:00 AM EST. Just because you lowballed the fee and got lucky with mining timing doesn't mean you should actively mislead others. You should do more research into transaction fees, because &lt;lowest fee that got into the previous block&gt; is not a good fee estimation algorithm for anything time sensitive. 2 sat/b got confirmed at 10:44 pm EST. Anything less than 60 sat/b didn't go anywhere for over an hour after that. Mycelium has probably put much more effort into their fee estimation algorithm than the random site you posted.

You posted on reddit at 11:00 pm essentially stating that anyone sending at 79 sat/b was overpaying. That is provably untrue. If you sent earlier, then good for you. The fact is that any transaction after 10:45 pm EST with a fee of less than 60 sat/b is still pending as of 12:33 AM EST. Fee estimation for confirmation in &lt; 1 hour is not as trivial as you make it out to be. If you're just sending money to a buddy for weed then no big deal. If you're doing a transaction for significant value that's time sensitive then accurate fee estimation matters.

If you sent anything after 10:45 pm EST with a fee of less than 60 sat/b as of 12:23 AM EST it has not confirmed. Mycelium's estimate was very accurate.

Mycelium's fee estimate was accurate. Yours was not. It happened to work out for you because you got lucky regarding the timing of blocks mined, but if anyone had a time sensitive transaction to send at that time then 79 sat/b was appropriate. 7 sat/b wasn't. Nothing has confirmed at less than 60 sat/b between 10:45 pm EST and 12:45 AM EST. Mycelium did a far better job estimating appropriate fees than the site you posted. Fee estimation is far more complicated than "I sent with 7 sat/b and it confirmed so lol who paid more."

So if you used the recommended 79 sat/byte you would have been confirmed 2 blocks later.
If you used 7 sat/byte you haven't confirmed as of 12:11 AM EST and probably won't for several hours.
Chalk one up for Mycelium.
