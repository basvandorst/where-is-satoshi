I don't want anonymity. I want to know where all the money is going. I think a problem with our current banking system is the lack of transparency. Open it all up. In the internet age, the only privacy we can ever hope for is the privacy of solidarity.
The other reason the ramen noodle person wouldn't want bitcoin is because it takes a fucking half an hour to buy a bowl of fucking noodles.

You mean like, a bitcoin bank? Maybe they can also upgrade to loans, and give me a card that has an available line of bitcoin credit on it? these ideas are so novel and new... I wonder if they could loan me enough bitcoins to buy a house, with interest of course, so instead of paying cash to a bank on a mortgage, I could pay bitcoin to a bitcoin bank on a bitmortgage?
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:19:49
Because functionally, bitcoin is no better than the dollar. If you can't buy a bowl of ramen with it, you're missing an essential ingredient for a viable currency. In order to make bitcoin viable, you would have to do everything to it that was the reason we all wanted out of the dollar to begin with.
I've lost the small amount of faith that I may have had. I sold off the last of my coin around $830, at a profit. I'm looking to buy back in when it gets low, but only to make money off the hype. My other investments can't touch the terrifying volatility of bitcoin, it's been incredibly risky and profitable. I do not believe bitcoin will change the world, and right now I'm not even sure that it will ever recover.

That is a professional business-to-business complaint letter. I will fully admit that I, as an individual consumer, could have been much more diplomatic about my response. I do not agree that I am in any way obligated to, and I also do not agree that doing so in cases like this will return better results. I do not appreciate being fucked with, by humans OR automated servers, and do not now even want the transaction fulfilled. I want all of my transactions cancelled and to do no further business with Coinbase. If their system allows good customers who have already purchased through their system to suddenly be flagged and cancelled at the last minute with no warning, then I do not want to do business with them.
If there was any implication that this was even a possibility at any point before I hit "submit" then I would not be so angry. Their failure to disclose this up-front borders on fraud by itself, and is definitely not professional.
I'm not trying to get the contract honored, I'm trying to express my dissatisfaction. I think I adequately did so.

Statistically possible, not possible today, perhaps possible tomorrow. I said nothing about whether it's feasible.

the Technophile in me loves bitcoin and wants to believe there's no way to crack the system. Maybe technologically there isn't, but economically, there are plenty of ways to destabilize the system.

Because the internet is not secure, or free of regulation itself.
If they can't find a way to sell your bitcoins, they can control the price of them by buying and selling as they see fit, or they can make transactions difficult or impossible, or intercept packets as they pass through your ISP server, or any of myriad control methods. It just has to be worth it to them.
Bitcoin may survive, but if it does, it will be regulated and price-controlled just as all currency is today. In that case, what's the point? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:41:16
Original two purchases (buy $2000 at ~$150/BTC) were cancelled a week after I requested them, three hours before they were supposed to deposit to my account.  I sent support emails asking to get un-flagged and frantically made two more purchases (buy $2000 at ~ $200/BTC) to hopefully lock in the price before it skyrocketed further.
After receiving no response for four days, I sent support email asking If they could cancel my two pending purchases, as I was dissatisfied with the service.
I got a response within hours, pushing through all four transactions at their original price, overdrawing my checking account by $557, and putting a $2000 hole in my budget. (Luckily, it was a $2000 hole that was already worth $2500, was worth $4000 when I sold it, and would be worth $5500 today.)
So, my positive experience with coinbase is only positive because bitcoin itself is awesome. I consider coinbase to be a necessary evil at this point. They **really** should put some kind of message or notice up to new users, and should **really** have some more transparency when they're having issues.
Leaving your customers in the dark for 11 days is terrible business, but what they did with my transactions after cancelling them is pretty much illegal. They could just as easily cancel a transaction, wait for the value of bitcoin to drop, and then push it through at the original price.
Luckily for them, bitcoin is performing well enough to make up for their shortcomings.
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:51:41
You have no way of knowing whether or not that is true. I know my results, and I know the average results, and I have absolutely no problem saying that I am a remarkably successful speculator. :)
Especially with a commodity as predictable as Bitcoin. The overall value may change, but there are definite patterns to be exploited.
In stagnation, it takes a good algorithm and many transactions a day, but with regular swings of 1% or more, even when the value goes nowhere there's the potential to double your holdings every day. The chances of that are astronomical of course, but I was managing an average of 2.46 points a day through the flat. That's doubling my money every month. It's really not that hard, I'm sure there are a lot of people doing the same thing and keeping quiet about it.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:14:07

I'm currently "all-in," but that is a statistic that changes depending on the market temperature. At 6:45 PST this morning, I was "all out" waiting to see where the price was going. As it stabilized over the next hour, I got back "All in."
I even managed to protect my dollars against one of the 7% crashes, and then got back in. This strategy is turning out to not be too difficult, and I am increasing my holdings of both BTC and USD.

"The national median existing home price for all housing types was $199,500 in October" from [

I don't guess. I create models and let calculus do the guessing for me. The only thing I'm guessing at is the resilience of the market, but even if I'm totally off on that I won't lose money, I'll merely fail to make any more, at which time I'll move on to something easier.
You obviously don't understand, or you'd be doing it as well.
You compare it to guessing the right number between 1 and 100, but it's really more like guessing the right number between 1 and 2. If I can get it right even slightly more than 50% of the time, I win. Also, I know the person picking the number, I can see his face, and I've already watched and guessed about a thousand times and recorded every indicator and the result of that guess. Now I have a model to test. If it fails testing, I re-calibrate or abandon the game. If it passes testing, I tell the computer to guess until indicators change.

I don't see them, or the FED, or the Bank of England, or Wal-Mart, or the Communist party of China, or the NSA as "evil," just that eventually, the very things that make alt currencies great will make them unacceptable to organizations with the power to stop them. In the same way that nature abhors a vaccuum, the global economy cannot long abide a decentralized, unregulated exchange.

it's more like a professional poker player telling you his net gain. they make a living off what some people call "gambling." I ride volatility.

There's a difference between things that are possible but unlikely, such as a brute force attack, or covert military operations against bitcoin moguls, and things that are possible and likely; but all of them are possible.
I'm incredibly skeptical on an economic level that bitcoin will be allowed to be what bitcoin users want it to be. The technology seems fine, but only right now. There has never been a piece of code written that couldn't be broken in some way, and when the money starts getting really enticing, bitcoin is going to be taking an all-out assault from all directions including some internal ones, and it won't survive.

Also, as soon as it hits 100,000 the bet would be over and debt paid.
The way I see it, there is one condition under which I pay him something worth $10,000 and infinite conditions under which he pays me something worth $0.001 to $9,999.99.
I still feel that the odds are in my favor. In fact, I'm guessing he'll have to pay me, but the amount will be insignificant.

They could just sell all *your* bitcoins.

They actually did not do anything until I sent an email asking them to just cancel all of my pending transactions along with the flagged transactions, and that I would be doing my business elsewhere.
At that point, I, the customer, had at no point requested that they honor the original price (two transactions totaling ~$2000) and had asked that they cancel two subsequent transactions totaling ~$2000. They instead sent me an email saying that they're sorry, they have whitelisted me, and pushed through all of my transactions at the original price. Effectively, I was forced to purchase $4000 worth of product that I no longer wanted, $2000 of which, I *never* wanted.
I would be extremely pissed, and probably pursuing legal action if the value of bitcoin had not nearly tripled since then. Now that I'm approved for instant transactions and whitelisted, Coinbase seems to work great. They lucked out.

Do any of these places accept bitcoin directly, or do they just accept bitcoin through a payment service like bitpay or coinbase? The places I have been to convert it to cash.
If they don't accept bitcoin directly, then isn't it just another exchange? If it's just another exchange, then what's the point? shouldn't I just pick the one with the lowest fees and highest USD payout if I want to spend my bitcoin?

It took longer for me. It was over a week. My replacement orders (at higher cost) had already gone through by the time they got back to me, and when they honored my previous orders they did not ask me, and overdrew my bank account by $500.
I made much more profit off those honored requests than off the newer ones, but I wasn't exactly thrilled with Coinbase's system either.

If he wins, those are the stakes.

There's an unlimited number of tools at their disposal. Crashing the market into the dirt and keeping it there seems to be the most likely method, and There are limitless ways to arrange that.
It would be subterfuge, not anything publicly acknowledged.

The only reason I'm into bitcoin is to pull profit out of the market volatility. If I want stable, easy-to-use currency, which I do, I'll use the dollar, which I do.

I don't want a lot of things. What the people want only matters in as much as it makes us easier to pacify.

Is absorption any different from rejection, if it's then just integrated into the current regulated system?
If the bitcoin gets big enough and widely used enough, I am certain that the world financial markets **will** find a way to exploit it, exploit it until there's nothing left to exploit.

"regulatory authority" Hahahaha! You still think that matters?
Money protects itself at all costs, it has since wealth existed. Your scenario with malicious software is the much more likely result.

As far as a fatalistic attitude toward bitcoin, you're absolutely right. I had the same sort of attitude toward the bank bailouts, the second invasion of Iraq, HD-DVD, and the Patriot Act. :)
