I’m always struck when I go to the USA about how awkward and slow it is paying for everything as there is almost nowhere I can use contactless payments.
In the UK almost every payment I make now is via contactless card or Apple Pay and when something asks for real change it’s so frustrating! I think the US would be in a good position to pickup cypto payments quite quickly as you don’t really seem to have any of those fast simple payment systems (correct me if I’m wrong).
I also think too that when I’m travelling it would be so great to have the simplicity of the contactless payments but not having to think about the huge fees and terrible exchange rates each time I use my card and crypto currency would be a great way around this in the future.

So we will make the problem worse to force investment in renewables and R&amp;D?

That’s assuming demand increases though right?

Sorry but I don’t see how this changes the fact that bitcoin mining uses a massive amount of energy when really we should be attempting to scale back our energy usage instead as you say yourself.
If people really valued the cost of energy at your fingertips then they would find an alternative to energy intensive mining wouldn’t they?

So on point one, this essentially means that bitcoin will need to get to mass adoption by the time that all bitcoins are mined?
