I experimented with this on a website as a form of donation for the blind. Basically you play a game in browser and a part of the CPU power was mining for a cause. It was clearly stated, on the site and you had to agree that you understood.
After about a month of testing I had to drop the project because of the monero scare! The site  was flagged as dangerous even though it did not download anything or hijack anything. That combined with windows throwing a security warning anytime you visited the site.
It is sad because it's a great way to raise money and not need people to give physical currency. Not sure if I was the 1st to attempt this in a browser but Boinc and gridcoin use a very similar concept in it's software. Sad that certain tech get terrible reps simply because someone finds a way to use it maliciously.
