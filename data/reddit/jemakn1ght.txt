I'm just surprised to see a Forbes article by an actual staff writer

I can't believe how many times you've made this mistake in this thread.

I think the Bitcoin community truly lost its way when it started criticising the idea of open source software.

You've seen it on the monitors in the background of like every news business/finance report ever.

Here are a bunch of Ubuntu forks, using the Ubuntu name, promoted by Ubuntu themselves.

I use Coinjar. They have insanely good sell prices, and also offer an EFTPOS card which you can use for purchases/at ATMs.

Gosh, if only the network was setup to verify the validity of a node and its actions using active computational power - the cost of which could be reimbursed to the user as some kind of reward.
Too bad such a thing doesn't exist.

Why do people still need to be told this
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:01
_Bad example_

Yeeeep. Typically the cheapest way to buy crypto in Aus is to use Coinbase and a credit card with no int. transaction fees/exchange fees.
Weekly limit eventually gets pretty generous.

For some reason we're miles ahead in the fintech space. Contactless payments are still kinda rare in the US, but when was the last time you went to an Australian retailer that didn't have them?

Either you're trolling or you have a FUNDAMENTAL lack of understanding of how this all works.
1BTC = 1BTC, no matter where you keep it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:33:37
Because that puts us back in line with the relatively steady growth before this ridiculous April-May bubble. We'll see though, I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:51:21
Yes. Using the passphrase.
Jaxx has a desktop client, which can be restored from the passphrase as well.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:31:38
1200 seems in line with the pre-bubble growth.

*Insightful* might not be the word I'd use, but it can be worth watching.

I love how you're claiming to be out of the loop enough to not know why a 16s/b transaction won't confirm, but somehow you've already pinned that on Blockstream.
I'm not saying you're wrong or right, as I don't take a side in the scaling debate myself. But you clearly either need to slow down and consider your research and conclusions are bit more thoroughly, or you're just doing this for point scoring.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:52:03
Yeah, they're always like 10% above everyone else - so I'd never buy there, but I'd definitely recommend for selling.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:20:04
1. Because it's safer to store in your own wallet
2. I'm not going to bother listing anything else because *it's safer to store in your own wallet*
As far as trading platforms go, *eh*.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:16:23
What you're talking about would make sense if you were turning it back into USD by selling your BTC (or maybe exchange for USDT, which has its own risks).
A Bitcoin is still a Bitcoin with the value of a Bitcoin though, no matter where you keep it.

Probably uses Coinbase
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:24:57
Pfft. Think about how much richer you'd be if you'd known the lottery numbers that week.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:06:41
Quality shitpost.

You can use a mobile wallet like BreadWallet, Mycelium, Jaxx or Coinomi to store, send and receive on your phone. All of these include a price ticker and will allow you to create a passphrase which can be written down as a backup to restore your wallet whenever you need.
I wouldn't say Coinbase is inherently dangerous, but if it were to fail in some way, it's impossible to know what would happen to your coins. 
If you haven't before, just have a look at what happened to MtGox. It sounds insane, but at the time we all considered it probably about as safe as we consider Coinbase to be now.

This meme is such a dark omen. Every time.

I recommended CoinJar above for cashing out, but depending on what you need the cash for you can also directly BPay with

Yeah I guess the attacks on all of them stopped too.

I reckon 1200.

People at work have asked me a lot about how to get into it.
I've helped a few people with crypto mining, but that's it.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong to say this, but I believe it would be easier to brute force the actual private keys than one of these security passphrases.

I feel for you, and I *really* appreciate you putting this out there.
As an Australian getting into similar trading, you've made me realising a need to stomp on the brakes and consider a lot of this a lot more.
You need professional legal advice on multiple fronts here, and it's good to see you're already talking to a solicitor. Good luck.
