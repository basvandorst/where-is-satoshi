i think the point that everyone may be (at least slightly) missing here is the fact that Bitcoin is another monitory tool. 
And an extremely important one at that. 
It in my opinion, it has the effect of something like a video camera on a 7-11 employee.
The employee knows that it is possible for his manager to review his actions if necessary, and quite possibly stops this employee from stealing $ from the cash register.
The camera in this example is Bitcoin 
-and as im some of you can guess, 
the employee is the Fed, IMF, the Bolivar?, 
- to me, BTC already is having this effect on our worlds economy. 
No noteworthy economic calamity since it's inception in 2009. 
Now we've gone 11 years without any large collapse, for what looks to be the first time in 100 years one could argue. 
coincidence? I think not. 
Let me know what you guys think. 
cheers :)

(all proof in Kucoins thread. Ticket number, conversations with Kucoin's staff, etc.)

that part is true. i also totally agree about your initial point. when i tell people to buy in,  i just hope they do bcuz this fiat Federal Reserve thing is the world foremost problem, and was the proven fundamental cause of all major war throughout history.

the pros are extremely relevant.
the cons are not.
with all due respect, 
with sufficient understanding of the bitcoin protocol, suggesting btc could "fail" is obtuse at best. 
i agree with btc being a sort of insurance policy.
but- why bitcoin would need to buy anyones coffee after it has usurped a portion of the gold markets speculation, and then add to that its extensible nature (can be endlessly improved upon), makes its "failure" speculation even more ridiculous. 
You wanna help the world while you are here? 
We only live once. 
Consider Bitcoins current risk/ reward ratio.
Grow a pair &amp; go long &amp; heavy in BTC!!!
