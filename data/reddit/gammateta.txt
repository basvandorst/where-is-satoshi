Maybe you mean dickcoin :)

Coinbase is  expensive and is a bad actor for bitcoin. I suggest you Kraken.com or Bitstamp.net

For privacy reason the three xpubs must be encrypted. Alternately , if you don't want to encrypt you can do in this way : suppose you have 3 location and 3 seeds (A,B,C)
 keep in location1 seed A and xpubB
 keep in location2 seed B and xpubC
 keep in location3 seed C and xpubA
In this way ,also if you loose everything in a location you can still get your bitcoin and your privacy is not at risk, without the needs of encryption

Giacomo Zucco in the very early time  publicy declared that altcoins are scams and now the market clearly show it. I think that the people he helped must be greatfull to him

If you spread xpub you loose privacy , everybody who can see it can know the number of your bitcoin. What is your opinion about   encrypt it with AES 256? Could be it reliable in the next 20years?
