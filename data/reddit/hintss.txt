@_date: 2014-06-27 06:07:22
until you accidentally make that private key public
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:06:45
wow what a responsible bug disclosure
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:53:12
yes on the last question
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:34:25

@_date: 2014-12-16 09:24:56
$0.000001

Something you might want to look into is the [block erupter blade]( It's literally 32 usb block erupters put onto the same board, and it uses 100W to produce 10 GH/s. You can usually find them on ebay for &lt;$50 (I got mine for $30+free shipping).

it's brainwallet's default
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:41:37
the first to be affected by critical bugs! :P
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:32:14
an empty box? not even a rock?
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:56:08
Just gonna add, as I just switched to armory and discovered this, you can actually right-click&gt;View address on blockchain.info on the address
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:43:15
you forgot the most important one: no chargebacks
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:58:45
downvote counts are faked, etc, etc

last I checked, link posts weren't editable

@_date: 2014-06-16 12:01:10
this is miner-side, not pool-side

cermark spray (which is what I'm assuming they're using, since it's what's normally used to do things like this, and since it seems to be made of some type of silica) claims to work on "almost any metal", with "nickel plating" being on the list of known-working materials
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:03:12
(assuming this isn't sarcasm) why would you ever give someone your bip38 key ever

These images are a bit low-resolution...  
  
(ignore this comment if those were just a draft or whatever)
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:53:54
and if the money disappears?

*points out the technicalities of so-called "change addresses"*
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:59:07
you could send it to the address that sent it to the brain wallet
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:28:16
$10/mo is actually pretty reasonable for running a computer 24/7, iirc that works out to 180W or so at $0.15/kwH  
  
*numbers pulled out of my ass from what I remember of power calculations when I was mining

Who said each gluster block had to be 1/a multiple bitcoin block(s)?
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:31:33
and he got those CCNs from people putting them into an obvious phishing site
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:15:07
just stick your coins in the mayo jar :P
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:24:37
if only it were literally criminal

If I guessed the code for your house key, that doesn't make your house mine.  
  
I think it'd be more accurate to say that since btc is accessed with a public key, if you crack one, it'd impossible to prove who the rightful owner was
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:34:14
but you just need one
@_date: 2012-10-04 02:14:47
or  
    shred /path/to/wallet.file

Someone still made the system, and whether this behavior was intentional or not, it's still someones fault

hashing is a one-way operation, encryption is reversible (if you have the keys/passes/whatever)

and not memorising stuff in case of memory loss.

it is.  
  
thing is, imagine how badly they could misreperesent bitcoin with this story.

I'm pretty sure "steal all the money" is potentially worse than "log into someone else's account with the username/password"
