RE: Difficulty of Use
I definitely agree with this sentiment and used to think this (difficulty of use) would be the largest barrier to bitcoin adoption for the average user.  However, let's talk about what makes it confusing (I agree - it IS!).  A lot of people consider themselves to be tech-savvy and immediately start downloading the bitcoin core.  You very quickly need to familiarize yourself with how the wallet works and do research into how to properly secure your funds... which will then lead to creating another wallet and you start going down the bitcoin rabbit hole.  But, now compare this to the simplicity of using blockchain.info or coinbase.  You can set up 2-factor authentication and have a pretty darn secure wallet in a matter of minutes... and documentation to show you how to use it.
The entire bitcoin platform is complex and overwhelming to many people.  But, how many people own a checking account?  Of those people, how many of them understand how their transactions are recorded and how banks clear money between one another?  They don't!  Let’s use Chase as an example.  Chase controls the technologies that Chase customers use to conduct their banking.  Chase also uses their agreement with other banks and other frameworks in order to clear money between parties with as little risk as possible.  There is a huge layer of abstraction between what is actually happening in the banking world versus what the average checking account owner understands.
So, whats the difference?  We still need technologies that use the underlying Bitcoin framework which hide this difficulty in order to make it easier for the average user to utilize.  If you don't need those technologies, you don't have to use them and you can use bitcoin core for all of your financial transactions.  If you WANT to understand the intricacies of the platform, it is open source and you can easily work through it.  On the other hand, how would Chase respond to a request for the level of transparency that bitcoin provides?  They would say that A. They can’t give information for the security of their customers B. Everything is proprietary C. They would never allow anyone to see a part of their ledger unless they were being audited or it was a part of some regulatory compliance.  Once you give them your money, it goes in to a black box and that’s it.
You are the sole owner of your bitcoin.  If you want to transfer it, you throw in a small transaction fee, giving incentive for the bitcoin network to process it and include it in the “global” ledger.  You get rid of Chase altogether and don’t throw your money into a “black box”.  If a financial institution wants to use the bitcoin framework, they can.  The manner in which this framework is used presents unlimited possibilities... many of which will make the platform much easier for the general population to use.
There are much larger issues with bitcoin than ease of use… some of which are presented very well in this writeup.  I’ve been thinking about the ease-of-use argument lately and wanted to give my 2 cents.

Might want to try a different browser.  Expect a long delay for ID verification due to the large volume of new users.

You should not be using a wallet that has any fees for its use.  The fees come in when you make transfers... but YOU set the fee.  It is an incentive for the Bitcoin network to process your transaction.  The more you pay, the quicker the transaction will occur (more incentive for it to be processed first).
More importantly, you should be looking for a wallet that affords you the greatest level of security.  ALWAYS use 2-factor authentication for ALL transactions.  I personally use blockchain.info for my transactions and offline (cold) wallets to store my long-term investments.

It is very, very, very unlikely for a technical issue to cause a transaction to go awry.  The real scenario is that you sent money to the wrong person or your account (or wallet) was compromised.  Let's use Coinbase as an example of a third-party that uses the Bitcoin framework.  They make money on holding your Bitcoin and providing an exchange.  What is preventing them from insuring against these scenarios just like a bank does?  Sure, the fees would be higher than properly securing your wallet using the Bitcoin core and using it to make transactions.  However, you're paying a fee to cover yourself in these scenarios.

If we made a post every time GDAX or Coinbase went down, we'd crash Reddit's servers.

Based on your questions, I would strongly encourage you to hire an electrician to look at where you want to set up your S9.  I'm assuming you don't want to burn your house down.
Also, keep in mind that the S9 is VERY noisy.

No, you would also need the private key that accompanies that wallet.  Unfortunately, you're SOL.

the = this, might want to edit
Completely agree, thanks for posting this!
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:28:36
Or just don't post this on Reddit to begin with.  It is asking for trouble.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:23:44
There also isn't a one-to-one relationship between people and wallets.  I, for example, have several wallets for transactions and a few cold wallets for long-term holding.

Coinbase is now asking for a lot of this in advance (I'm guessing to help expedite these processes).  I even uploaded my internal OFAC compliance policies.  I'm sure it makes the processing these transactions a lot smoother when they know you already have internal controls that address these concerns.

One other point of view: consider how many people have jumped on the Bitcoin train in the last couple of weeks.  It is also possible that they're just not prepared to handle the volume of transactions and customer service inquiries that they have received over the last 2 weeks.  There seem to be delays and outages across many of the major exchanges.

Let's brainstorm options for you:
1. Use a different exchange
2. Start your own exchange and do a better job
3. Stop complaining and deal with it
4. Sell your coins and move on
I agree it is frustrating... been in the situation many times before.  But, it is a Coinbase problem.  If they're doing a crappy job in your perspective, don't use their platform.

Or, continue to buy bitcoin and USE it for something that you would otherwise use your fiat money for.  This is what will ultimately drive the success of bitcoin (thereby increasing the value of what you've set aside to invest).  You'll be surprised to see that some of the online retailers you already use accept bitcoin.  I have multiple monthly expenses that are now paid with bitcoin (and NO, not drugs!).

Even if you get lucky and have 100 folks with reasonable GPUs that connect to the wifi, you wouldn't make any money (far less than $.01 a day... probably can't even round up to a cent).  And you'd likely have customers using your electricity, meaning that you WOULD ACTUALLY LOSE MONEY DOING THIS.  Mining requires ASICs nowadays to make any reasonable amount of profit, and even the best ones are not extremely profitable (depends on the cost of electricity).  If this is actually happening, the person behind it is actually losing money.
It is possible that they could be mining an alt coin, though it would be very obvious to customers when their laptops start to heat up and it would kill their batteries.  Probably still wouldn't make anything.

The velcro bag doesn't sound safe to me because it might not be air tight.  To test this, put the velcro bag over your head and see if you can breath.  Only way to be sure your BTC is safe.

Completely agree with this.
Coinbase mentions: "This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
Still not advocating the storage of coins at Coinbase... but maybe this will afford more security for the funds we do keep there.

Even a $2,000 tank with the current price $17,430 represents a loss of less than 6%.  If you're buying a few hundred dollars of Bitcoin, it is pretty trivial.
Assume that you won't ever get your money out of Bitcoin.  Then, stop worrying about the price and buy for the long-term.  Or, even better, find some bills you can pay with the coin.

If we could give a good answer to this, we certainly wouldn't be posting it on reddit and would be extremely rich tomorrow.
My intuition says that there will be a slight drop while the uncertainty shakes out.  The fact of the matter is that having futures gives major legitimacy to Bitcoin.  It is a win for Bitcoin.

I can also attest to this.  I lost far, far more than $8k USD from this flaw.  It is more on the order of $100k.  I can't even to describe the sick feeling of logging in to one of my accounts and seeing 0$.  I believe they got my login information from bitcointalk.org and started investigating more of my information based on private messages I sent on the forum.
I can say that I have profited much more on BTC, though even the little things like this make me re-think what I'm doing with BTC.  I just don't see it as something that will be adopted by the general consumer.  I'm gradually selling off my BTC and depositing it to US-based bank accounts that are each FDIC insured.
