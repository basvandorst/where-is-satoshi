Dude I am right there with you. I was trying to figure it all out back in 2011 and gave up because it was so technical and sketchy. 
I have ragrets. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:11:01
That wasn't me who won....
I just came here to read and ask questions!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:29:04
I agree completely.
I guess I'll just have to keep on reading and learning before I can grow enough balls to invest in it.
But I've been telling myself that for a couple of years now so who knows when that time will come!

Kill yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:59:57
Just chill.
Watch the price this weekend and by Monday or Tuesday everything should be back to a normal pace. 
(Unless someone get's hacked over the weekend like Mt Gox and loses a ton of everyone's money. Then there is a massive sell off and the media picks it up again crashing the currency even further.)
But, what I just mentioned above is not a normal circumstance.

Interesting. I got paid today so I might have to give this a try tomorrow if the market price is right.
Any advice on exchanges, wallets, charts, info, etc?
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:04:15
I need it to go to $2 so I can become a player.
^I ^wish

If you would format aka add paragraph spacing to your post more people would read that terrible abomination of a wall of text you wrote.

How do you view the market for bitcoins at the current time vs the past month or so?
What were your holding stratagies for bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:33:53
Which exchange did you buy them from? 
What wallet do you trust?
Asking because I am interested in doing the same.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:09:10
That's why I do what I do :)
Have a look at the archive - 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:21:27
How accurate do you think  is on the price of USD vs Bitcoin?
I want to know if it's a reliable view on current price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:28:06
It would be awesome if it would show the current price of the bitcoins while showing the orders.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:31:52

How do you hedge your bitcoin investments?
As far as market volatility what do you think will happen in the next month or so based on the last two months?
I'm actually interested.

Why the fuck is this bot in every thread.
I can live with it I guess but it's really annoying.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:34:25
I agree.
I do have a ticker in another window but just having it all on the same screen would be helpful.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:16:57
Right, so you think that it's just going to crash to $0 and stay there forever?
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:39:56
Being a hipster democrat on reddit will get you no karma from me sir.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:32:41
As someone who knows nothing about coding or programming and only brief knowledge of bitcoins, I want to be able to login to your exchange and use my damn credit card/debit card to buy bitcoins for the market price right then and there.
As I and many others have discovered just going through the process of trying to purchase bitcoins is a HUGE pain in the ass and it really needs to be simplified. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:19:09
2 but I want to become a 3.

He's a troll man.

I've got a degree in Mass Communication with my focus being Public Relations and Marketing. My minor is in English.
Yes, I am available for hire.

**Why is it so extremely difficult to actually purchase bitcoins?**
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:35:53
Have a read on this - 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:29:29
The market volatility and the simple fact that it seems like a pain in the ass to make a purchase to begin with.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:56:59
If you buy in right now at $75 or whatever the current price is today it could go up to $105, $225, etc. 
You wouldn't be losing any money. 
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:17:47
+1 for the joke.
Actually I already have a job doing marketing and PR.
I could always use a second one though so that's why I said I'm available. 
I'm just trying to get ahead as quickly as possible!
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:16:45
I really want to start trading.
I'm just afraid of the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:15:31
How do you think they stole it from you?
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:44:00
It's been a long day.
I apologize.
*sorry bot*
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:26:47
I apologize for being late to the party. 
With Ripple would I be able to use my Visa,MC,AmEx, etc and just straight up buy bitcoins?
I do not think the website explains in enough detail for everyone to get involved. 
I mean, I read the part about the XRP but I still don't even understand that.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:39:31
God bless you!

I'll stay poor and the smart people will continue to get rich.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:32:11
Why do you see the price dropping back to $10?
I'm generally interested in trading bitcoin so I'd like to understand your viewpoint within the market.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:07:39
Dumb reddit user is dumb.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:18:17
You're not missing anything. Keep me updated.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:26:31
Can you give me a walkthrough on how you deposit the cash?
Do you just go to the bank and tell them you want to deposit cash to the website? 
Do I need to create a wallet on the website first?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:13:54
It's basically high frequency trading.
In truth, I would love to be able to write a program and have the funds to do it myself.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:24:54
High frequency trading.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:36:31
So if we are throwing the only technical analysis we have out the window, what are we supposed to trade on?
Personally if I were about to buy I would sure as shit look at the past two weeks at a *minimum* to gauge what I think the market is going to do tomorrow.
Disclaimer - I know it might not help and the price could drop out of no where but charts and volume are really all there is.
What do you think the market price will do going into next week?
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:35:15
And that's funny because NIST was in charge of the 9/11 commission......
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:53:57
I think this is a great idea to keep people from getting ripped off.
Might as well list some good bitcoin wallets as well that are trustworthy.
I don't know of any yet.
