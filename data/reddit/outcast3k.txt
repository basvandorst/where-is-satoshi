You should try  instead. It gives nicer results and is calculated on the client side.
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:47:15
There are a number of different ways to resolve this. But before you do any of them, i would suggest looking up your address on a block explorer and check everything you have received has confirmation and that the block explorer has your correct balance.
Please also remember coinb.in is just some clever JavaScript, you always control your keys not coinbin.
You can either:
1, Wait for the conflicting transaction to expire from the memory pool (can take 3 days)
 2, Assuming you are using the  section of coinb.in when a transaction fails to broadcast it should give you the hex encoded version, on screen. Take this and broadcast it via another provider like chain.so,  block.io or blockchain.info
3, Manually build a raw transaction via the new transaction page by putting your address into the top and filling out the rest of the form. Once you've submitted the details, you will need to sign and then broadcast the transaction with your private key.

 is doing pretty well as a web wallet. Its existed since mid 2011 and never been hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-12 08:46:41
Sounds like you are having problems, perhaps trying to double spend or something similar.
So either wait for it to expire from the mempool, or take your raw transaction and try to broadcast it via another  blockchain service provider. You can do this by going to the settings page ( and then choosing a different provider to broadcast it via, perhaps try selecting chain.so, then visit  and past your transaction in there. With any luck it will broadcast then.

Uphold formally known as bitreserve are possibly the worst bitcoin company to still be running. Their CEO is quite happy to use the bitcoin economy to start his company, but has publicly stated that he doesn't expect bitcoin to be around in 5 years, whilst simultaneously trying to register bitcoin like patients. They suck so bad.

The user sending these funds clearly has no idea what he's doing (or has the worst luck in the universe) I'm not sure returning it to the address it's come from with out a good chat is really the best idea.

We basically had a backwards compatible block size increase with segwit, it was the first step forward and whilst it maybe a slightly complex solution the important thing is it keeps older bitcoin clients in the game; with out breaking them. Bcash doesn't do this, and isn't directly compatible with older version of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:23:23
Https://coinb.in is pretty neat, but mostly aimed at advanced users.

Coins do not disappear. Stating otherwise is FUD. A delay is not the same as disappearing.

No it won't steal your private keys. They are generated in your browser using javascript, they are never stored server side.
Full disclosure, I'm the developer for coinb.in.
If you navigate to the coinbin about page, can see a link to a public bitcointalk thread where there is a lot of positive feedback. If you check the github repo you can see that it's been reviewed and forked by hundred of community members. Further more, coinb.in has never been hacked, and I personally have a good reputation for delivering what I promise, as I've run many group buys too.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:56:52
Thanks for the feedback, plan to make all of the changes mentioned.

Hey Everyone,
This is a beta page of our Bitcoin Fee Calculator Page which will be integrated into [coinb.in]( in the new year. However, as it stands it seems it might be quite useful to some of you to release this [tool]( now.
Feedback welcome.
Merry Xmas!
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:00:43
Using multisig  or a timed locked address  hope you find them useful. Enjoy!
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:57:42
And you only need to use other open source third parties when your funds become trapped by copay, as seen in a recent post. /s
*Edit*: to add link, 
I'm sure I've seen at least one more complaint about this, but can't find a link now.
*Edit*: seems they was using copay in a "non standard way" thanks for correcting me kinoshitajona

Coinb.in makes OP_RETURN easy. Visit  and look under the advanced tab. The project is open source and can be run offline. Enjoy!
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:03:29
You can download the entire code base of coinb.in from github (see the link in the footer) and run it locally offline through your browser (no setup required, or any server, its just html and javacript). 
If the "coinb.in" servers go offline for what ever reason, there is a settings page which you can use to configure the software to work with other providers, such as blockr.io and chain.so (and more coming soon). Hope this eases your mind just a little. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 09:17:18

Really sorry guys!! perhaps I miss understood the video or commented on the wrong one. It looked like you used your site to generate your public/private key pairs and used coinbase at the end of the video to deal with multisig, but now I can't find that same video. Strange.
Best of luck with your project!!

First you would paste the redeem script into the field at the top on the new transaction page: 
Then once you have built a transaction from that page, you can sign it with your private key on the signing page: 
Finally you would broadcast your transaction: 
Hope this helps! :)

Try experimenting with 
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:57:46
The "Non final" error indicate a few different things, however in this situation it means you are trying to submit a transaction prior to its release time.
If I take your redeemscript, and push it through the verify page here:
You'll see your release time is: 12/30/2015 09:55 - so you'll need to try again in 9 or so hours. I recommend you resign the transaction when you do.
Hope this helps.

With out even needing to modify the bitcoin client or protocol an easy solution would have been to log the inputs of a transaction when a user withdraws. Then, if a user ever claims they didn't receive the funds, mtgox can just check the inputs and follow them through the block chain. Assuming the date, receivers address and withdrawal amount are the same, and only the transaction id differs, you could quite easily determine if the user received their funds or not - and even identify the new transaction id.

Hey, This is correct. You can not use "addresses" you must use "public keys" when creating a multisig address. Does this clear it up? :)

@_date: 2014-12-08 12:16:43
Basically you need to build your transaction again.
Visit this page  enter in your redeem script, press load. Then enter in the address you are sending it to but this time making sure everything adds up. 
Then you can sign the transaction here  and finally broadcast the transaction 
**Edit**: Remember the signing procedure will need to be completed at least twice! You can enter the hex encoded transaction into the verify page and check the amount of times they've been signed.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:48:47
1, Visit  (its open source)
2, Download wallet locally (
3, Run coinb.in in an offline environment, disconnected from the internet probably from a bootable USB.
4, Save your keys somewhere, probably to an encrypted USB.
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:45:21
Https://coinb.in over bitaddress.org as its way more functional, but probably best use a hardware wallet if inexperienced.

Hey, good luck!
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:37:09
Sure, no problem!
The page is designed in such a way that you would usually pass the transaction from person to person to sign, one person usually wouldn't hold all the keys.
What you need to do is, on the signing page enter your first private key, then enter the transaction you want to sign. And press the Submit button. This will generate a transaction in a green box, with your first signature attached to it. 
Now copy the transaction thats been signed (the one in the green box) and paste it back into the transaction text area, and enter a new private key, and press submit again. This will sign the transaction with your second key and add the signature to the transaction ready for broadcasting.
Let me know how you get on!

Sending from the same address more than once is bad because it exposes your public keys.

I generally agree with you, but I didn't say it wasn't bad for privacy reasons. Whilst it may not be a critical issue to expose a public key today (and aside for privacy reasons) its good practice not to use an address with its public key exposed.
After all, an address is just a one way hash of your public key. If there was no reason to add this layer of security why do it at all?

That's kind of wrong.

I assume you are solely talking about the  section of  and not the tools on offer. To clarify for you; the  is meant as a quick and easy storage solution for small change, not large sums. The keys to the  are generated by combining the email address and password along with other data unique to coinb.in. This is then rehashed multiple times (50~) before using the given value as a private key. 
To clarify; no keys are ever stored in a database on our server, they are regenerated inside of the users browser, based on the users credentials when they visit.
Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:25:40

You're making a mistake, and not copying the signed transaction which is presented in the green box and pasting it back into the transaction box and resigning with a new private key!
**Step One**:
Enter your unsigned transaction onto the signing page:
Then enter your first private key and press submit, and you'll be presented with the signed transaction in a green box.
**Step Two**:
Take the transaction in the green box with one signature attached to it, and paste it back into the transaction box above, then enter in your second private key and press submit.
This will sign the transaction, adding the second signature to it. You can then take the updated transaction in the green box and submit it via the broadcast page.
***Note***: You ***MUST*** copy the signed transaction given to you in the green box, back into the "transaction box" above it and resign it with the second key. This is because in a real life scenario you would be giving the transaction to the other participant for them to re-enter and to re-sign with their private keys.

Https://coinb.in is another good one to use

Nice advert. Lol
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:13:56
Hey there!
The problem is, you are not including any inputs in the transaction. If you go back to  and first enter in your multisig redeem script at the top and press load, it will load your inputs into the form below and you can then enter in the destination address and amount on the output tab. Once you've done this, you can sign it and broadcast the transaction.
Let me know how you get on.
*Edit*: if you paste your raw transaction on the the verify page here  it will decode it for you. When learning to create raw transactions this page can be useful as it will show you the inputs and outputs and tell you if and how many times its been signed or needs to be signed.
@_date: 2015-01-23 08:31:01

I looked up a hand full of addresses that have made transactions to the above address and dont see any reusing the R values. So that's a good start! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:41:40
And I scouped up loads of them. Thanks bears
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:48:15
If you take your transaction and enter it into the verification page:
You'll see it shows that it is a multisig 2 of 3, but its only been signed once.
You need to take the transaction you've given me, enter it onto the  page and sign it again with the other key. Once its been signed by both keys you will be able to broadcast it.
Let me know how you get on!
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:30:23
You can use  to craft an op_return transaction. Hope that helps!

You can make a raw RBF transaction on  - The option is located under the advanced options panel.
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:37:12
I said the tool was pointless, because there are many other easier ways for people to do this with out having to worry about understanding python and the librarys that are needed when using his code.
I implied the stunt was crap because there have been many examples of people successfully executing a double spend with out being an attention whore and with out  linking to their own pointless code.
We can agree though that it's probably not a great thing to accept 0 confirmation transactions 
All the best.
Edit: also I suspect there is a strange kind of hidden agenda here, if he can convince everyone 0 confirm doesn't work well he can push RBF.

You might want to do a fact check before you start posting in future.
His double spend tool was committed to github on 17 Apr 2014. Coinbin is way older than that. Further more I wrote coinbin from scratch and can categorically say it does not use his tools or code in anyway, coinbin is a JavaScript based web page not python.
Sure, zero confirms are unsafe, what the hell does that have to do with the rest of the stuff you have said, or that I originally posted. Let's see, nothing.

Thanks for your feedback, I understand what you are saying, but the user can simply add their own "change" address. This is really the only logical way to have the UI deal with it, I cant have the UI predict where to return the change with 100% certainty in this environment.

I'm not sure about coinkite but user could probably help, he works for coinkite.

Hi there,
Please do not support coinjar.
Please see more info here 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:01
Https://coinb.in support segwit
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:06:41
Does it have to be python? Would  be sufficient?
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:33:38
Did trading just start? with no 15 minute warning? Err.. Thanks...
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:02:28
I know this doesn't help much now, but in future consider using  instead (or even coinkite.com). This kind of thing can't happen there as you can download the entire site and run it locally. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:00:07
I actually wrote the code for coinb.in. its open source, free to use edit and redistribute! Its existed quietly for a long time (since 2011) and probably was the first web based wallet to properly implement multisig transactions. It doesn't receive much attention (probably because its not listed on bitcoin.org) but its never been hacked and has gone under lots of testing (you can see the about page for a link to 11+ paged bitcointalk thread and github repo) 
I understand you have no reason to just trust me but if you look through my history (aside from the code I've worked on) you'll see on bitcointalk I have escrowed over 500 btc worth of transactions for various users all with out any issues ever!
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:24:26
Hey! there is a list recent changes can be found here   the files and their hashes which have been verified by myself can be found here  which you can then use to compare the files you've downloaded. Best place to download them would be direct from the github repo here 
On a side note, I have several systems setup to make sure the files being served aren't being tampered with. There are several servers I have hidden, checking the hashes of the files the web server and repo are serving up, every minute. One slightly stripped down open source version I have written can be found here 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:27:34
[Coinb.in]( is aimed at advanced users, but with an influx of users wanting to learn and experiment with bitcoin and our features we have decided to put together some guides which we hope you find useful!
@_date: 2015-08-08 09:54:27
Wouldn't using op_return be better?
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:50:27
Consider using  instead, there's a .onion link on the about page if you want to keep your traffic inside the Tor network.
@_date: 2015-08-20 08:25:06
Checkout  for an easy to use wallet that is open source and can be run locally as well. There is plenty of other features too like Multisig and HD wallets etc.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:29:04
If you have the private keys and don't mind doing a little bit of work you can download  and use the page  to create a new transaction, then use  to sign it and finally  to submit it into the network. Good luck!

@_date: 2015-07-29 22:59:08
When broadcasting a transaction via  it does not require you to run a full node locally because it is connecting to the coinb.in server. If you don't want to do that, you can take the hex encoded transaction you have built and manually broadcast it via another service like blockr.io or if you have a client setup locally through that. Good luck!

Its fact that at the moment of replying to your post the price is up 7% this week, so all the Greeks who saw the banking crisis coming are up 7%. *It's easy to make statistics sound good and bad*.

Also, it appears as that the OP has since removed his post. PMSL.

@_date: 2018-02-15 10:35:47
I wasn't bragging about 3$ fees, I was calling out your 50$ fee rubbish. At 2 sat/byte, you can get a 266 byte transaction confirm for 0.00000452 btc which is about $0.04 at the time of posting this (see Https://coinb.in/ as reference) 
Let's part ways, I wish you all the best.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:36:03
Before we part ways I will leave you with two quotes from Jihan Wu/Bitmain one of the people who helped create the fork known as bitcoin cash. (Aka bcash) [No, please stop this. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. We should not confuse it with Bitcoin.]( and [Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.](
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:23:46
So we can agree, based on your chart you have provided that the quote of 50$ was quite an excessive estimate and it can be a lot lower. If you zoom out of the charts a little, it generally show fees being less than a couple of dollars over the last 9 years, although there was a spike recently, but hopefully that will continue to drop with the network upgrades that have been implemented or that are in development.
Also you say there was never a period, but this chart shows the median, I have had 2sat/byte transactions confirm in the past month, so it's entirely possible some very well funded and popular wallets/exchanges are using badly designed and outdate code that are not [batching transactions](  and massively over paying on tx fees.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:19:07
I'm not a fan of bcash. Saying that, giving those who want the ability to move and sell their bcash is something I was happy to do, but the pull request contains some issues it needs ironing out to avoid it failing on you. I decided to first spend my time testing and deploying segwit as I'd had already written the code a short time back.
To clarify I'm not saying I won't eventually allow it to be added, I'm just saying I don't have time to make it perform better right now.
@_date: 2016-09-09 15:23:14
Santander black listed a bank account of mine, for trading Bitcoin. Literally nobody at Santander can send me a wire transfer. Lulz

Thanks friend, hope you are well :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:56:36


The point I'm making is, to claim it's failed as a currency based on data only selected from the last 3 month is silly, it needs to be much wider which is why I'm encouraging you to look at the last 9 years, and more specifically not 1 month... Because using your logic, we could say; if it's above 50$ in the last 3 months it's a failure, so in 3 months from now if we take that data and its consistently below 50$ on transaction fees using your logic it will be a success again.? Lol. Its bad logic.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:34:24
Maybe in 10 more years.

@_date: 2018-02-15 10:40:13
And your chart shows you it's no longer 50$ .... Like the current price is no longer $19,000 per bitcoin. Damn man...
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:39:56
A lot of users of  are enabling segwit on their wallet, its good to see we are making progress! :D
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:22:22
Segwit addresses are generated from the same private/public key pair as regular addresses, so if you just hand a bitcoin client a WIF key it will think it's a regular address unless you prompt it to check the segwit address, or its supporting it by default.

People have been double spending via  for years, it's open source, can be run offline and most importantly you are in full control of your private keys. You can do it all with out first having to send your bitcoin somewhere, where you won't own your private keys and will loose money if the site vanishes.

@_date: 2017-09-19 15:59:12
 - it even supports segwit :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:18:47
Last week, we enabled  in the tools section of coinb.in which meant with a little bit of effort custom SegWit transactions could be built and sent. This week we've given users the ability to use a segwit address from the  section! (Click advanced options)
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:58:16
Look I hear what you've said, there was this one time when bitcoins fees was very high last month, but if you take [the chart]( you've provided and put it back into liner mode from the logarithmic mode you was reading it and look at it over it's life span, the fees have generally been very low. Further more, whilst the fees did skyrocket at this one particular point, the data you are providing shows that the fees have dropped back to an average of $3 not $50. I personally have been paying almost nothing and been getting confirmed very quickly.
I wrote this to help,  right now 3sat/byte is confirming. I'd love to see some actual contribution to show your understanding on the situation.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:27:26
Seeing a lot of users at  using it as the web wallet has it enabled by default. *big grin*

Considering coinb.in is not a heavily funded company it's a open source project and it does not advertise. Its  still processing several thousand transactions a day. Not bad in my book :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:11:42
Best place to check right now is Https://coinb.in/
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:04:32
lmao ;) $1 it says!
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:07:05


I don't think so, there are plenty of us who use it as a currency.


You've literally screwed with the stats so much their I had to respond. So in the last 3 months we had a period of large amounts of transactions (spam or not) being processed, which raised the fees, but what about the last 9 years?!?! Of which transaction fees have been tiny.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:27:24
SegWit Addresses are now enabled by default on Coinb.in wallets! If you have an account balance in a legacy address its still very easy to switch between them by using the drop down menu after you've logged in.
Aside from segwit by default a new fee estimation feature will be released in the coming weeks, in an attempt to help get those fees lower! We've also got a few other goodies, such as multisig addresses that support segwit!
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:33:36
I think it will be added eventually yes.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:22:43

There shouldn't be any issues as far as I can tell
@_date: 2015-09-11 19:32:14
Hey, Coinb.in dev here.
Assuming this is for a 2 of 3 multisig, follow these steps and read my explanation: 
* **1**, Visit 
* **2**, Enter the first private key and unsigned transaction and press 'Submit'.
* **3**, *Copy* the signed transaction presented to you in the green box and *paste this back into the text area above it*. 
* **4**, Enter the second private key and press 'Submit' 
* **5**, Broadcast the transaction
It appears, some people fail to copy and paste the transactions at each stage. The reason you need to copy and paste the transaction from the greenbox back into the text area above each time it has been signed,  is because in a real life scenario you wouldn't own all the private keys. The idea is you would simply pass on the transaction for them to also sign and then broadcast when enough signatures have been added.
Hope this helps, let me know how you get on :)

Yes. This dev actually tried to implement a black list to stop certain payments that he personally considered blockchain spam and would complain about other people using op_return to store data all whilst simultaneously spamming the block chain with offensive biblical quotes. WTF!!

Boycott coinjar and any project Zhou Tong is ever involved in!!
@_date: 2015-11-21 17:11:08
Its a server side problem. Your coins are safe, will be fixed any minute. Sorry about this. 
UPDATE: bitcoind crashed and wasn't restarting properly, because of this it was failing to broadcast your transaction. I'm setting up a secondary server to prevent this happening in future. Sorry for any inconvince caused.
UPDATE  Everything should be back to normal.
@_date: 2015-09-23 09:37:01
DO NOT USE COINJAR!
It was created by Ryan Zhou (zhoutong) a known scammer, who has stolen THOUSANDS of Bitcoins.
Avoid him and his projects like the plague.

@_date: 2016-05-13 20:39:03
Your address is a "hash" of your public key.
As a test case you can visit the new address page here:  and you'll see you have 3 fields. An address, it's public key and it's private key. (You can also have your bitcoin client generate the same key pairs if you don't want to use coinb.in)
First, make sure you take note of all 3 if you are going to use it, especially your private key. 
Secondly use the public key it's generated on the second line, put it into this page  and select a date and time.
Finally, press submit and note down the redeem script and address which you can send funds to.
Hope this helps.
Edit to add: once the time has passed, and you want to spend the funds, you can take the redeem script, and enter it on to this page  and build a transaction. Once you've built it, you can use the other pages to sign and broadcast it into the network.

This is cool, and whilst many would agree it is likely satoshi mined who the first few blocks it's not necessarily true, and it's possible other people where mining at this time too. Really we should only be monitoring the coinbase address in block 0 or block 9 as we have evidence that satoshi owns the private keys to those addresses. Anything else could potentially be anyone.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:50:54

You can use  to verify the redeem script used by multisignature addresses and thus all parties can determine if they are paying the correct address and validate the pubkeys used! Hope this helps!

Where and how did you contact "them"? I am the only developer for coinbin, I am very active and usually respond as quickly as possible.
Please remember that because of the way this wallet functions (i.e. you are in full control over your coins, not us) Coinb.in doesn't offer the typical support services that other wallets have to provide when they don't give access to private keys.
Further more I see no messages from you on reddit, I see no email from you to support(at)coinb.in or my email address directly, which is OutCast3k(at)gmail.com nor do I see any posts from this username on the github repo or any posts on the bitcointalk thread.
How exactly did you try to contact me?

I'm not a fan of the design/template/layout i'm afraid to say, BUT the actual content and explanations are written very well. Overall nice job!!!
*Edit*: On your tools section, It might be useful for people if you either open sourced your backend so people could understand whats going on at a code level, or better redo it in javascript. You can use the code at  for that.

That is not the EXTRA code you have written into knots. At least when I last checked it was so strict it would disable transactions from specific addresses etc. You shouldn't have that right over someone elses money.

If you have the hex encoded "raw transaction" paste it on to coinbins verify page here;  and it will tell you quite a bit about the transaction, including which address its being sent to.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:28:36
 
@_date: 2016-05-21 15:56:57
It can be found under the advanced tab on the [new transaction]( page. You can also take a raw transaction and put it onto the [verify]( page and it will tell you if RBF has been enabled.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:59:20
This should now be resolved. Thanks 
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:24:11
Hey, coinb.in dev here.
Have you checked your address on a block explorer? Is the balance the same or different to what you expected?
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:12:11
Hey bro!
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:56:45
You can create a transaction via  and then sign it using the other page. Once you've crafted a signed transaction, using the same inputs, but with a higher fee you need to find a node that's not already received your transaction and then have that node broadcast it into the network.
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:00:06

Https://coinb.in/ its open source, free to use edit and redistribute, can be downloaded and run offline. It has a long history and works well with other services. Enjoy
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:23:23
I get what you are saying, and for people new to bitcoin, bitrated maybe a slightly easier and less complex option. I like bitrated, hence mentioning it. However  actually offers a mediation/arbitration service as well as allowing you to create completely custom multisig addresses with any meditator, from any site at any time. Plus, users might actually learn a thing or two about how bitcoin functions.  All the best.
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:31:42
My employer does accept bitcoin, as does my Host. My ISP doesn't yet. But this is besdide the point. They didn't launch themselves by tapping into the bitcoin economy only to ditch it after making some easy money.

What a load of bullshit. But if that's how you justify the crap you make me store on my hard disk then what ever.
Edit to add, /user/luke-jr as you clearly avoid the point I'm raising. Im referring to all the spammy religious quotes that you personally added to the blockchain, that have absolutely no use and are totally pointless, you know the stuff thats not been voted/nominated on. Further more you didn't even "pay" to store the data, at least people storing data in a transaction   pay to do so. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 11:23:54
 that one worked for me using an online qrcode scanner via  and via mycelium and my phones barcode scanner. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:09:33
How exactly is this working? Are you asking the user to pay to an address, which you then forward on after to create an op_return transaction? Isn't  (click advanced under the new transaction tab) far easier and less likely to go wrong because the user can create a op_return transaction from their own unspent funds with out needing to first forward the funds to a central service like your own.
@_date: 2016-05-18 09:22:07

What about the biblical/religious quotes you put in the blockchain luke-jr, aren't those just as bad?
So let me get this straight, it's OK for you to spam the blockchain, but nobody else in your opinion?
Edit, you down voted me, then deleted your statement. Hilarious.
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:03:51
As it stands yes you are correct. The user would have to note down some details on the transaction, or perhaps simply leave the window open and just regenerate and resign the transaction with a higher fee. 
Saying that though, you raise a good point and you have just given me an idea to make it easier to regenerate a transaction, which I will try to implement a little later today.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:01:44
I disagree, unless you are stating that you have removed your own personal code which you added to knots to prevent transactions from certain addresses that you have personally deemed as spam.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:55:40
Coinb.in is open source and is one of the few wallets that puts the user in control of their public keys. There is no way the site can take your bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-05-23 07:49:51
TygerJ99, this is an open source project, designed for advanced users who understand the bitcoin protocol. Coinb.in can not steel your bitcoin as it does not have control over your private keys.
Bitcoins that have not confirmed have not been stolen.
Your problem is (I'm guessing) you have not provided a high enough fee and your transaction is stuck and has not confirmed, that does not make us thieves, nor does it mean your bitcoin has been stolen. The problem is the bitcoin network is too busy to process your transaction because the fee is not high enough.
Bitcoin transactions with fees that are too low that don't confirm within 72 hours are usually returned to your wallet.
I would suggest once your transaction confirms or is returned to your wallet, you do not use our services again, especially if you are going to make public posts like this.
All the best.
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:06:38
Kinda cool, I like the comparison. But its far less secure, i bet all those locks can be picked in no time.

Bitcoin knots is the only client to enable your own personal black list by default, people are forced to disable it. Show me where in bitcoin core there is a black list to prevent specific transactions being processed in the same way you do.

Shame it's using ripple though and not bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:41:28
When you verify a transaction on coinb.in it will split it into two sections, unspent inputs and outputs.
The first part known as the "inputs" is basically where there money is coming from. You'll see transaction ID and some other bits.
The second part, nearer the bottom is known as the "ouputs" and is essentially where your bitcoins are going. 
*If you see your address in the outputs and the amount is correct there really shouldn't be any harm in broadcasting it.*
All the best.

He said, bitwage supported a conversion of GBP to BTC  via uphold. (But it turns out that they do not, which is why I think he deleted it) 
@_date: 2016-05-13 19:44:48
So, you don't complain if a user mines a block and adds 95 bytes of data, but you would complain if they use op_return and add 80 bytes or other methods to store data, messages or ramblings (aka "prayers"). You realise, obviously, that only a very few select few (mostly pool operators, with enough hashing power. I.e. you) are going to be able to put data in there, not the average person. This doesn't sound fair. You are such a hypocrite, it's a joke.
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:47:44
Http://coinb.in isn't affected as you manually build your transaction. Check it out, you'll probably find it useful
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:22:38
Nice work!! :)
@_date: 2016-05-13 19:35:15
I don't think voting/nominating is relevant, but you mentioned this first. I believe you can store what you want, as can anybody else. My issue with you is, you will put ramblings into the blockchain, but complain if anyone else does. You are a bit of a hypocrite here.

In all honesty, I have no experience with bitmixer.io and if it's worked for you I'm happy for you, but I'd prefer to use a trustless option where possible, and be in a position where i don't need to worry about the service robbing me. Joinmarket right now seems to be the only option for that.

Probably shouldn't support a fork of the bitcoin client that has a filter and blocks transactions that the author has personally deemed as spam. It sets a very bad precedent. This fork doesn't sound like satoshis digital cash to me.

This kind of service is only really useful for spamming the blockchain with data/messages. But op_return can be useful, it's currently being used by stealth addresses for example.
