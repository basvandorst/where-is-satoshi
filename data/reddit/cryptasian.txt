Certain Lamborghini dealerships accept Bitcoin though...I wonder how the taxes work out in that case.

I definitely would encourage xCoin users who were affected by the hack to come forward with information. The article has details about where to submit information. 
There has already been an ongoing collection of information to help combat fraud and it would be very satisfying to see justice served to fraudsters - friendly and unfriendly alike.

It's a joke. The timing just so happened to be perfect.

Agreed. The ICO scene got stupid. People trying to raise funding for ideas that weren't solving any problems. It became about the money and when money is the focus, a venture will not succeed. Very few projects had a product or business plan...it was an exciting get rich quick play...and when it came to delivering on what they said they would do, so many projects either couldn't deliver or ran out of money (somehow ��). 
The markets crashed because if was hyped up. There were a lot dumb kids with gold fever who didn't know a thing about business who decided they wanted to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. The more investors joined, the more it fueled the stupidity. Then there were a lot of scams and to top it off, the stock markets went to shit and the fed started raising rates. Funds that had any holdings sold their crypto. Even though it was a small part of their portfolio, it was a significant amount of money for the crypto market. 
That's just naming some of the components that played a part in the grand scheme of things. There's definitely a lot more to the picture...it wasn't an evil bank lol I mean, fuck banks...but they aren't the cause of the current market conditions.

Yep. Same shit as when people call a private blockchain a blockchain. It's just a glorified database that has redundancy in multiple locations....the word blockchain is just trendy and big companies feel cool using it. ��

The Bitcoin github repo currently has 21,730 forks - the beauty of the fact that it is open-source is that there is literally nothing keeping people from copying the code.
Bitcoin isn't about to be replaced though. Part of what made it possible for bitcoin to get to where it is right now is the fact that no one knows who Satoshi is, so the government can't go after him. The missing entity is also why people trust bitcoin more than coins that are driven by a company. A company's sole purpose is to make profit for its shareholders, so you can't possibly count on them to make decisions that are in the best interest of the people. Satoshi had to be anonymous because he launched a zero-day for the central banking system by creating a decentralized currency - if the government had found him, he'd probably have been eliminated.
Satoshi had the right timing. Bitcoin was released soon after the crash of 2008 and offered a solution to the problem with the current financial system (I'm waiting for the student loan bubble to finally burst lol it will be significantly worse than 2008). 
Traditional finance has already started to get in to bitcoin - even ethereum hasn't had as much success. If you made a bitcoin copy - why would it be special? It isn't anything new and no one would buy it.
