Yep make them eat that transaction fee lol. I used them for the last time yesterday to take some btc out. I used a segwit address, and it still took over 10 hours for the transaction to confirm and they paid 500sat/byte.  Ridiculous.
Shit company.

This year as commish of my league, I am giving anyone who pays their buy-in in BTC a significant discount.  If they want to do it standard by cash its $50, but if they pay in BTC, it's only $30.
The winners will also be paid out in BTC only, so it behooves them to learn how it works now as if they win they will need to learn anyway.  
Also just for fun, I'm asking everyone to "lock in" whether they want the USD value of the prize pool on draft day, or whatever that BTC equivalent is worth on the day of the championship game.  
For example, for first its ~$350, or .5595 BTC if the price locked in today.  You would choose whether to receive that flat rate equivalent (the 350), OR whatever that .5595 BTC is worth on the same Sunday/Monday of week 16 or whatever it is.  Everyone makes their choice before the season starts.

You are young, I'd say go for it.  All successful people I know say take risks and make mistakes early because you can afford it.
Odds are in 5-10 years when you actually need that amount, that will be only a paycheck or two for you.
Like some other people have said, be willing to lose all of it and you only have the potential to gain.

He didn't say that. (??)

And when you call them would you agree there's a difference between them laughing at you and calling you a fucking idiot and someone who suggested leaving earlier next time, asking if you can take the next flight, etc.  
He isn't saying the product was faulty, he said the customer support was poor.  Those aren't the same thing and aren't even the point of the post lol.  Go ahead and reply about how it still doesn't make sense though, I guess.

There can be a universe of difference between a person or company who actually cares about their customer and wants to help them, and one that doesn't, regardless of their ability to be able to or not.
OP clearly states it was their own mistake. Independent of that they also had a negative experience with a company's product involved when he tried to tell them about it.  This isn't rocket surgery.

A technology that uses blockchain and similar principles to Bitcoin? Yes 100% inevitable.  Whether it's Bitcoin itself or not remains to be seen.  Maybe it's Facebook, maybe it's Myspace.

Thank you this was very helpful.

The real answer is no one knows.  We are in uncharted waters, where 99% of things that get this much traction this quickly ARE bubbles.  But this might not be.  I personally don't think it is.
Most people say it as a lazy answer to something they don't understand, because if they are wrong no one will remember. Ask them about cryptography, PoW/PoS, how a blockchain functions, etc, and watch their eyes glaze over.

Over the realistic timeline of several years, if Bitcoin is real and only continues to grow and become adopted, yes even buying at 4900 is a great idea (though not necessarily your net worth which is obv never a good idea)
I think the world which most people envision is a sort of "role reversal" where a crypto whether it's BTC or not becomes the standard, and Fiats become ancillary.  At that point and at every point along the way it will become more and more commonplace and you'll be able to make everyday purchases with no need to involve fiat at all.
It's just "overstock" now the same way that email  was only a handful of providers in the mid-late 90s.  You wouldn't say something like "unless you plan to send all your email through AOL" nowadays.

God damn who gives a fuck whether he's SN or not. He's clearly been in the space since the beginning, and has the intelligence and background to at least be listened to.
Don't like appeals to authority? Good! Ignore it and actually contribute to the discussion instead of pointing out the obvious like you have a point.

I think a r9 280x on TD in 2014.  Or a Dell refurb tablet with an i5 in it.
