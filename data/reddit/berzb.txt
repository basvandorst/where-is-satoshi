This is not a thing. Bullion is a general term for coins, ingots, etc. I think you mean a gold bar, which is worth about $462,000 (for a 350oz bar). The same value in $100 bills would be 163oz, which is honestly not much lighter given that one is paper and the other is /gold/.

I've had terrible luck with chargebacks, regardless of any supporting documentation I may have. The only time I actually managed to successfully charge back something from a merchant who fucked me over, was when I was overseas and got double-charged for a large purchase. This is with many banks, not just one. Chargebacks are NOT easy.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:52:15
I was not addressing chargebacks, as those happen /after/ payments have already settled.

Scams are by definition dishonest. The entire concept behind crypto is that it /forces/ honesty, from end to end. So how is it a scam?
I could see an argument for it being a fad -- but not a scam. I could see an argument for the current value being artificially inflated by people looking to make a buck, but that's hardly a scam that's just how unregulated markets work.


Well, we've already seen reactions like the advent of the "Same-day ACH" -- I firmly believe that was a direct reaction to bitcoin's ability to speed along money transfers. We've seen in less developed nations that bitcoin can empower people to take back control of their local economy, which will /hopefully/ lead those governments to getting their shit together. And with LN I'm hoping we can take away /just/ enough of the traditional payment network transaction volume (say, 3%) to make them panic and start fixing some of their bullshit like anti-merchant chargeback policies, lack of basic security and identity protection, etc.

I think focusing on blockchains and their related tech being "user friendly" is the wrong approach anyway. We really don't want the raw blockchain to be used by Joe's grandma anyway -- there is a legitimate reason why traditional banking is composed of multiple layers.
As I've said recently in other threads, the blockchain and its associated transactions are more akin to ACH transactions and wires -- things the vast majority of the population don't use, because the systems behind them are complex for the sake of security and don't really /care/ about user friendliness.
Instead they use things like debit cards, which Lightning Network will bring a sort of equivalent into play. I think focusing on ensuring that the blockchain network is secure and only worry about "enough" people being able to run it is the key, then focus on the Lightning Network being user-friendly.
EDIT: We already have problems with large numbers of computers (mostly users, some servers) being used maliciously in botnets. Imagine a network where a large % of the machines running nodes were on home computers, infected with a virus which waited until it had control of enough machines and then BOOM, started maliciously manipulating the network.
EDIT 2: In fact, I think lightweight nodes are perfect for the average joe to run specifically because they have zero power over the network. This increases the security of the network by ensuring full nodes are primarily by those who have proper knowledge and know-how to run a secure instance.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:38:02
So instead of making sane arguments, you resort to ad hominem attacks. Go back to with all those other chumps.
Why are you even bringing 2x into this?
Look, if block validity from the miner "didn't matter" then we wouldn't need block confirmations -- the nodes would just reject it, and it would never end up on the chain. The reality is:
* Consenus relies on a known ruleset, and rulesets require knowing about possible attack vectors. We don't know all of them. There are also zero-day bugs that could exist within the code which would allow a malicious block to pass muster. This is basic security man, get with the program.
* You're completely ignoring the reality of the 51% attack, which has been a known attack vector for ages --- 
Also, quit being a troll.

Everyone understands that "with enough hashing power" you could do just about anything inside that 2-week window. In fact, numerous people have in fact stated such just for you to berate them.
What you're failing to understand is that you would, as an individual, 600 times the hashrate of the entire network in order to /reliably/ mine a block a second. You'd need 10 times the network's hashing rate to reliably mine one every minute. Given the largest pool is only 14% of the network, I doubt very highly anyone could pull this off.
So what's your point?
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:37:39
Well, fuck.

And the vast majority of that 2% is due to fraud (chargebacks, anti-fraud measures, identity theft, etc).

I said /sane/ arguments. I understood your arguments, and they're nonsensical and you didn't address several of the points I made in my original post. You'd rather make assinine statements than have a rational conversation.
You're right, it's a complex subject, and your attempts to dismiss that very complexity by insinuating that hashing power has no bearing on currency security are bewildering.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:30:10
I would say the lightweight nodes are important in building tools which can track ;ledger state without requiring the entire blockchain (thus making it cheaper and easier to manager -- but as far as I know very few people have bothered, as they'd rather just run a full node.
I would love to see a system that would "snapshot" the ledger and put it in cold storage for later verifying that the blockchain hasn't been tampered with.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:20:15
Sorry but that isnt at all what any reasonable merchant on the planet thinks.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:19:17
Raw hashing power plays a part insofar that the network must cumulatively have sufficient power to thwart any singular entity coming in and throwing shit blocks onto the chain by out-performing the decentralized miners.
**EDIT:** Not just shit blocks, but causing rapid inflation by coming in and mining the balls out of the coin before the difficulty can increase.
Decentralization of control is important to prevent a malicious entity from taking control of enough of the network (51% attack, etc) to start forming malicious blocks. This means a lot of things -- no more than X% of the network within a single legal jusidiction, no more than X% of the network under a single pool (or group of related pools), etc. The more spread out mining is, the less likely someone can take over enough % to do something terrible.
**EDIT:** This can also defend against someone come in and artificially-deflating the network's hashrate to drop difficulty, then ramping back up immediately to rapidly mine blocks and causing massive inflation.
Full nodes are responsible for "checking their math" -- ensuring that the blocks mined and submitted are accurate, and spreading them around, enforcing all the consensus rules, etc. The more of these there are, the less likely someone is to control enough to thwart the self-regulation of the network.
As for listener/lightweight nodes... There was a suggestion somewhere in this thread that they somehow contribute to the immutability of the chain -- except they don't. For all intents and purposes they're transient, make no outward contributions to the network, and don't enforce any rules. They will basically believe anything the full node(s) they're connected to tell them, for better or for worse. So no, listeners don't help secure the network -- in fact it is highly suggested by most people that those worried about security or wanting to contribute to the security of the network do so by running a full node.

That.. that really doesn't answer the question. A BIP can exist for 100 years without anyone actually bothering to implement it. There doesn't seem to be much info out there on what wallets do or do not support BIP125 to any extent. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:37:22
I mean, the code is all open source -- you can theoretically do whatever you want with it. But the devs have publicly stated that people should NOT be running it on mainnet, because it isn't production ready.
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:09:22
Many merchants carry insurance for these instances and really don't care, they'll just ban a customer and be done with it. Also, chargebacks are not that easy.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:40:11
How many in-person merchants who accept bitcoin actually bother? This is part of why Bitcoin is not a good currency for in-person transactions, there is entirely too much legwork on the part of the merchant to protect themselves from fraud. Particularly larger merchants, where you'd have to train personnel on precisely what to look for.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:51:07


This is about instaneity of trust, not the actual transfer of funds. This is what matters -- not the transfer, but the instantaneous guarantee that the transfer WILL happen.
That's all LN will be providing too. Since the actual settlement still happens on the blockchain, it won't speed that up at all. What it will do is provide a guarantee that the settlement will happen by removing the ability of either side to manipulate the transaction without the express consent of the other.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:40:41
I understood them and refuted them.

If you use the RBF protocol and set the miner fee obscenely low, you could exit the merchant and issue a replacement TX that reroutes the money back to you (with a proper fee for mining).
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:12:35


They aren't slow for merchants. They're slow for payment processors. Merchants pay payment processor fees to eat the risk for them, merchants get paid relatively quickly (a couple days to a week, for some processors its next day).

Ok so, first off "none of this matters" is just... a terrble response to what I posted. I was providing information to help people understand crypto-world vs banking-world. It matters to them, whether it matters to you or not.
Secondly, you can't see the future. crypto gets more and more popular every day, for a variety of reasons. The reality is that the current state of banking is in dire need of a direct competitor, and that's where crypto comes in -- whether that's bitcoin, ethereum, some random coin nobody has released yet...
And sure, most people might continue to use CCs, etc. But if we make an impact on HOW those systems operate, we've made the world a better place.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:32:22
Possibly. The premise is that the merchant is running with less than perfect procedures. Honestly it takes so long for a transaction to get a confirmation to begin with that you could probably pull it off without a low tx fee
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:59:38
Sure, which is why Bitcoin has such an advantage over existing solutions. Or at least, will -- once we have a payment network like LN working. At least, for BTC to BTC transactions.
BTC to Fiat will still take longer, because you have to rely on an exchange + traditional banking transactio.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:00:22
Talking about "settlement" when it comes to Bitcoin is a bit of a misnomer. Bitcoin has no inherent concept of settlement, unlike traditional banking. Rather, bitcoin operates off levels of cryptographic trust.
When you send out a BTC transaction, you have to wait for confirmations. The more confirmations you have, the more likely it is that your transaction is valid and irrevokable. Past a certain number of confirmations, it is mathematically unfeasible for a transaction to ever be revoked -- it's at this point that most would consider the transaction "settled" in the context of traditional banking, but there is no magic "settled" switch (and some merchants consider 1 to be adequate, some want 6, some could arbitrarily want 100).
So on average, Bitcoin reaches the point of irrevokability far faster than any traditional payment system. But while this may be useful for exchanges, banks, international wire transfer systems who use BTC to send currency across borders -- it doesn't matter at all to consumers or merchants.
When a buyer goes to a store with a debit card and slides their card, from the merchant's perspective the transaction is essentially guaranteed (there are chargebacks, but that's another matter) and the buyer knows the money is gone. The VISA/MasterCard network may take longer to finally settle the transaction on the backend, and the money may take a bit to reach the merchant's bank -- but that isn't what either side care about. They care that the transaction is near-instant, and for all intents and purposes irrevokable due to guarantees by the card issuer and payment network.
Bitcoin doesn't yet have this level of service. For buyers and merchants, bitcoin /sucks/. You can sit and wait for confirmations, or just let the buyer go and hope they don't screw you somehow. 
LN will fix this (Real Soon Now (TM)) by providing an extra layer that does provide the realtime irrevokable transactions that existing payment networks already provide, which will give us the best of both worlds and like see a much more widespread adoption of bitcoin transactions at local and online merchants. But we're not there yet, by any means.
*EDIT: To help some folks who are unsure of the parallels between Bitcoin and traditional banking...*
* BTC = Currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc)
* Blockchain = Transfer Network (ACH, Wires, SWIFT)
* Lightning Network = Payment Network (VISA, Mastercard, Discover, AMEX)
Those are the closest analogies I can think of. Often times people think of sending bitcoin as making a "payment" but the reality is that the closest thing to traditional banking is a bank transfer. LN will provide an actual payment network, and in the spirit of competition I hope many others eventually sprout up as well.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:16:19
Ya, it's not instant settlement, it's confirmationless trust. That's what merchants need is instant trust.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:55:09
This isn't about someone "fucking up," this is about the probability of discovering nefarious code. The greater the complexity of the code, the lower the changes of discovering nefarious code.
And you're right, it can be -- all the more reason to open source that bitch so we can see whether it's even worth using.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:04:58
That depends. Right now, 3/5 of the world's wealth is held in USD. This is primarily because USD is the standard currency for a huge percentage of world trade. If BTC can manage to become a standard currency for international trade, it could well hit $1m or beyond. But that's a long way off.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:44:51
There's about $215 trillion in total wealth in the world. There are 17,000,000 bitcoins right now (roughly). If all wealth in the world were turned into bitcoin, a single bitcoin would be worth $12,647,058.82. That would mean a satoshi would be worth $0.13 (roughly).
That's nowhere near $1 USD, for the entire world money supply.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:52:26


As we all know, it takes forever for wallets to implement BIPs. Do we know how wide-spread adoption is at this point?


I thought the topic at hand was current state :P
Yes, eventually BTC will allow secure, guaranteed near-instant transactions -- enabling rapid, trustable in-person transactions. But we aren't there yet, and in-person fraud is currently pretty easy. That was my only point.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:02:13


Not their will, but according to their policies and agreements sure.


This isn't true at all. Where did you get this idea? There is an immense amount of anti-fraud process going on with existing payment networks to ensure the security of payments. You can't just magically go "LOL I WANT MY MONEY BACK" the way you currently can with bitcoin+some forethought.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:20:36


Ehhh, I think this is an issue of terminology. I think they might be thinking of the settlement date as when a transaction finally posts to an account.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:42:04


I really wouldn't go that far. There were dozens of factors then went into causing the market to exist in an over-valued state. Market corrections like that are to be expected. The longer it takes for the market to self-correct, the bigger the drop when it finally occurs. Most of us who invest saw it coming a mile away.
And yes, crypto is part of the economic market as a whole. The crypto crash and stock market crashes were both instances of the same correction.

The changing address is a good thing. You can map a receive address to a specific transaction, and verify exactly how much you've received for that transaction. This works wonders for auditing, automation, etc.
Embrace. the changing address.
