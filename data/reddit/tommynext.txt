In short cryptocoins history we have experienced multiple exhange crashes. 
So if you are not trading you would be better of to move them to some private wallet.

The best of cryptocurrencies will only gain from bear market. The worst will be destroyed. So better to stick with best technologies and best teams, they have the future and moon ahead.

It's opensource 
With own community and contributors. It's the main point toward being good/safe. Your have control over your private keys. Good history, nice reviews.
Though not very user friendly interface.

If price drops by 30%, these people change their mind usually

Theoretically market cap can drop faster than grow. It's more true when market cap getting bigger. 
I think it's not because verification or deposit speed, it's more about supply and demand. Some small cap coin might grow 1000% if some whales deside to buy it. While with big cap coin amounts of incoming money must be huge.

Dollar will not fail, but it will be much cheaper with years. Because Federal Reserve will continue to print it more and more.

We haven't had any very bad news though. And if price doesn't move on good news, maybe we have run out of buy potential? 
However, price moves every day. Not very volatile though. But say it to stock investor ;)
