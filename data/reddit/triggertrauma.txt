Excellent advice!
Poor but **proud** is the way to go.

Now this will help mass adoption. Telling newbs to contribute to a complex CompSci/Crypto project in order to reap the advantages Bitcoin has been advertising (low fees/fast transfers). I'll make sure mom and dad know that. /s
Meanwhile, I'll be using ETH with 15sec confirmation time.

Everything is good news™ on r/bitcoin! :D

Hey doog, do you also have a chunk in eth?

Congrats on not eating up all the anti ETH propaganda.

I certainly do like apples more than oranges. Here, I did it again. Now in what way are the numbers wrong? You bothered enough to inform me that you will not bother informing me. That's not a very convincing argument. Why should people care what a decentralized exchanged with negligible volume thinks, that's my point. What is the criterion? If you're looking for hashpower you'll look at big miners. If you are looking for user base (as is the case for a User-Activated SF) you look at those investing/trading/donating/using applications. Where exactly does a niche project with minimal public interest like that come into the picture and how does it justify 500+ upvotes?

 &gt;FUD
The chart you posted is not even precise (they still show a maximum of ~30 BTC /day which is still nothing)
You can get a clearer picture here, updated by the minute:
It's literally 2 BTC... So less than one second of polo trading
[And this is FUD]( how? This subreddit has some serious introspection to do...
