Coinbase is already juggling like 3 grenades, serving dispensaries would be like throwing them a stick of dynamite. They could do it, they just need to focus all their attention on the grenades right now.

Tax avoidance is a dangerous game to play as a business. In the short term this works great, however if bitcoin actually starts being used as a currency (like was intended) instead of an investment vehicle I'm sure Uncle Sam will make the rules on this very clear.

Bitcoin is not cheaper than cash, especially since we are all valuing bitcoins against fiat. 
From my experience the only reason a cash discount exists at all is because cash is immediate, you get it right then and there with no headaches. From a commerce perspective bitcoin is not quite that easy (although better than most current alternatives), I just don't see widespread bitcoin discounts in the future.

Its going to be interesting for sure.

Glad I could help ;)

Cmon man, it was at 850 for like 5 min and you made a post? I see it also went into the 600s after that and is currently back in the 700s.

Talk to Albert, he's considered a guru for this community. As an aside, I'd like to congratulate you for making a good decision, as we all now know good things will continue to be good. I hope your retirement is going good, because if so you may never die.

Chargeback scams are more a function of assholes, rather than an inherent problem with the payment technology. Your MTG community (which as a MTG player, I wanna say good job great idea!) most likely functions smoothly because the individuals are of a like mind, its hard to imagine generalizing that system out to represent all commerce. Its a tragedy of the commons, it just takes a few people to abuse the system to cause large problems.

Lol, I think you are on to something.
Think of bitcoin like a sandwich. Did we put ham on it, or is the bread soggy?
Think of bitcoin like a piece of marching band music. Can anyone play the tuba?
Think of bitcoin as how you fill out your taxes. Did you take the standard deduction in box 4A, or are you itemizing?

Don't write off credit/debit cards yet, you don't get to be a dominant global technology system by being absolute shit. I would not at all be surprised to see bitcoin backed magnetic cards taking off, especially if the payment processors integrate bitcoin into their current systems.
Right now when I get paid, I log into my banking website and see some numbers go up. When I swipe my card, those numbers go down. If those numbers were to suddenly represent bitcoins instead of us dollars, nothing would really change.

In what way?
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:17:27
It might also be silly to call 10x growth sustainable or reasonable...

In the service/contractor sector I could see the potential for a bitcoin discount, similar to a cash discount. In most retail settings however, the cash price is the same as the card price, so I'm not sure there is an incentive for these business to offer a discount.

Albert came into my life at a very important time. I had some concerns that good things might not always be good, or even more confusing, that bad things might be good, but we sure put those fears to bed!
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:20:16
Yea, it can be tricky. Whipping out the blockchain might not be the most user friendly approach though.

No thoughts on taxes, but after today I'd avoid Gox lol.

They were just down for ~90 minutes, came back online just a couple min ago. Definitely causing some uncertainty, especially because they were in the middle of a selloff when they started glitching.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:16:35
Isn't the whole point to use bitcoin as currency?
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:24:51
Man that was a bad strategy. See if the loanshark is bullish on bitcoins???
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:21:24
Sure it might save business a bit of effort, and everyone does like discounts, but most places have successfully priced in the cost of credit card and other transaction fees already. If bitcoin becomes a legitimate 3rd payment option to cash and credit, there will be little incentive to differentiate the price.
As it stands now I don't think it would be crazy for a small business/mom&amp;pop to offer bitcoin discounts, due to ease of transfer, low cost, etc. The one real concern I have is that if bitcoin does go mainstream some sort of middleman bitcoin processing company will step in and impose a similar cost structure to current systems, then there would definately be no reason to give a discount.

Christmas gift of bitcoins for old people sounds like a bad gift. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:55:16
Other exchanges, or locally (localbitcoins.com or something like that)

I feel like identity theft is better than having your bitcoins straight up stolen from you, at least with identity theft there are institutions and procedures to follow to try and fix things(although if you had your identity stolen I'm sure you are more familiar with that than I am). Currently hackers target the merchant databases, as well as things like POS systems, because they are where the money is aggregated and therefore represent the highest value target.
If bitcoin gains mom/pop acceptance levels, there are going to be a lot of wallets stored either online or on peoples computers. While some individuals will securely store their wallets, I'm concerned this may lead to financial incentives for hackers to target individual users more. Currently the cryptolocker/bitcoin ransom is the worst thing affecting everyday people,  if someone made a concerted effort to develop a botnet that goes after locally stored wallets and also tries to get online wallets, that could have a devastating affect on the currency as a whole.
