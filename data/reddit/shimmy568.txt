Hey it's me from an hour in the future. ETF was denied, moon later boys. ��
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:20:01
I mean let's not forget. If bitcoin does moon the dollar will fall so who knows what that one bitcoin will get you. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:26:57
This was because of the SEC's denial for the ETF on bitcoin. The price has seemed to become stable. Short answer yes it is normal for bitcoin to have these price fluctuations. Don't expect it to stay this low though.

Do you need I'd for something like a bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:50:58
Yes unless you are a millionaire and can get enough hashing power to not.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:13:21
Short answer no. Long answer, the difficulty is a needed for the bitcoin system. Let's say 10 people are mining bitcoins each has a 10% chance of getting a block. If then 100 people started mining if you wanted the difficulty to stay the same (10%) you would have to reward 10 times the number of bitcoins. This would cause super inflation and nobody would use it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:09:59
Yeah I'd stay away just use something like local bitcoins if you want to buy from a person directly.

@_date: 2017-03-19 23:14:37
Yeah just uninstall and redownload.

Give localbitcoins a try
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:00:25
They go by business days so it's only been like 2 days in the banks eyes. Not sure how long wire transfers usually take but that might be it.

Yes they could buy a large portion of the BTC. However this would only drive up the price even higher. And yes the trading volume would go down but because you can divide bitcoin up to 8 decimal places this would have little effect on the average joe and they would just trade and sell 0.0001 BTC instead of 0.01 BTC. This will even happen naturally as less bitcoin are made and more are lost due to whatever reason be it data corruption or just losing the password to an account.
If a government really wanted to attack bitcoin they would probably attempt a 51% attack where they would control 51% of the networks hash power allowing them do to some pretty nasty stuff. However for them to do something like that it would take (about) 1.1 trillion dollars. Yeah...
At this point any government could never hope to attack the network itself. Be more worried about it just being regulated into the ground.

Give kraken a shot. If that doesn't work in your country local bitcoins (website) will work.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:44:09
It's an exchange similar to Coinbase or what not. I had issues with Coinbase not working in my country either but I had success with kraken. I would give localbitcoins a shot though. That's a sure fire way to sell them. Good luck!

I'm having flash backs from the Great Depression when everyone withdrew from banks at once and they were all like lol whoops.
