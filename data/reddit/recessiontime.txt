US governments don't want their tax cattle to use foreign exchanges. Well duh. I'm sure the FACTA version for foreign exchanges are coming soon.

Love the moral hazard. The government is encouraging me to make huge risks because even if it doesn't pay off the tax payer will give me a bail out.

Keep telling yourself that. Even the ideal 8% figure is only beating out inflation by 3-4% in reality. 1m sounds like a lot today but when you are 65 you won't have much purchasing power.
40000 AUD doesn't actually buy you a "bit coin". You must be talking about USD. 1 AUD only gets you 0.67 USD today and continues to drop. You need just over 50000 AUD at the time of writing this to buy 4 "bit coin". $1000 in inflationary currency doesn't sound like much if it allows you to buy something like this. I'll be honest and say that Vanguard is probably the best option for Australian if you don't know about Bitcoin.

That sounds like a good deal if you can keep your keys. I have to wait til tomorrow to ask about audits .

When 1 BTC goes to something like 250000 USD the average person will not be able to own a full Bitcoin anymore. People will buy fractions of Bitcoins known as Satoshi's as a store of value.

Yes. Alts and Bitcoin fall under crypto assets.

I think Coinbase has an automatic DCA service. I hate to sound like I'm plugging this place but for $350 out of pocket they will give you the forms to fill out:
After I completed 6 forms it took only a few business days to set up my SMSF. Just follow the steps I outlined in this thread.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:22:44
It took 350 AUD to set up with 79 AUD monthly fees. But they do your taxes for you. There are other places but I found their fees higher. Some superfunds invest in crypto but they are few and charge high monthly fees. I also didn't love the idea of them holding the keys. If you can find a place with less fees please let me know.

I should have said gold has gone up, not spiked. I don't really want to argue over semantics. Just wanted to convey the idea that very recently all the news mentioned in the OP has made gold price go up but not having the same effect on Bitcoin. I acknowledge that Bitcoin price has outperformed gold in the past and even this year.

How much BTC to buy 8/10 Venezuelan wife!
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:36:11
ETFs also paper bitcoins which artificially increase the supply of bitcoins more than 21m. This is not good for the price.
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:19:18
What happened to Bitcoin pivoting from digital cash to digital gold? 
Probably too early to panic. If price doesn't break 20k one year after the upcoming halvening I'll need to reexamine the idea of Bitcoin as a store of value.

4 BTC is plenty enough for lifetime Citadel access in the future. 
I made this thread to encourage the idea of putting a portion of their pension towards BTC. I do realize that going all-in like myself is not sensible. Just wanted to tell people that you could do it.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:16:26
I can sell the BTC before retirement, don't have to wait to retirement age. If BTC reaches 200k I can sell a portion of my holding so I have fiat. There is a tax around 15% whenever I sell but it's less than normal capital gains we have here.

You can do both but it's best to send your btc to a hardware wallet address you control.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:35:07
Sounds very good.

Probably true. I used a local one since they let you cash out in AUD.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:14:30
1) contact accountant to set up your SMSF (cost me $350 out-of-pocket I used 
2) wait one week for tax authority to approve
3) open bank account for your SMSF
4) call your existing parasite superfund to roll over the money into your own SMSF bank account you control (took 8 business days)
5) open account with local crypto exchange in the name of your SMSF. Deposit all the money you can and buy BTC. Every time new fiat comes into your SMSF buy more BTC.
6) when tax time comes around your accountant from step 1) will handle it. Since you are just buying and holding you pay no tax.

The other benefit of this I didn't mention is that my sibling and I control our keys, not some money manager I've never met, not the banks, not the government. It cannot be confiscated in any bail-in. 
My only regret is not starting it sooner. I only heard about being able to do this 1 year ago and I was overseas and slow to act. I still think 4 BTC is enough to support my retirement. I don't see 4 BTC as 4 Bitcoins anymore. I see it as 400 million Satoshi's.

Good summary. I am also puzzled that gold has spiked while Bitcoin has dropped. It's likely that Bitcoin is not correlated to monetary disasters outside the developed world. The last cycle showed us a pump after the halvening and after the explosive success of Ethereum. I also remember BTC really taking off after Trump was elected and tech stocks took off. In my opinion, existing bubbles are what make Bitcoin inflate. QE money takes time to trickle down to the normies, it only exists on bank balance sheets for now. Wait until negative interest rate panic sets in. Things are accelerating, won't be much longer the monetary system can hide everything in plain sight. All the major powers know the US is insolvent and their only way out is inflating out of their debt obligations. China and everyone else has been quietly sticking gold while others like Belarus are mining BTC

It's possible to spend it for whatever. I could have bought baseball cards or art with my SMSF money. The difference is I'll probably secure actual retirement money with Bitcoin instead of seeing my money flatline or go down in value (which already happened). Having multiple passports I can even surrender my Australian passport, pay exit taxes and take the money with me if BTC goes to a ridiculous valuation. I also protect myself against government confiscation. It's asymmetric upside. I hope I was able to answer your question.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:17:54
I'm saying the result will be that people will buy Bitcoin ETF instead of Bitcoin. This is not good for price. The demand for BTC won't result in higher price if people buy the ETF instead of BTC.

If you are a dual national you can permanently leave Australia and by doing this your money will be released to a nominated account. There are hefty penalties in the form of taxes. There are many conditions for early release of money. This is just one of them.

Yes. I was shocked to find out that my employer has barely any money in his super and he owns 4 businesses. He will make it, barely, based on projections but the rest of us are stuffed. After a decade of working I noticed that all the money in my fund came from ME and not from money made in any investments. It was a glorified savings account that superfund managers would milk in fees.
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:55:32
That's sensible advice. I personally think not having 1-10% in BTC is financially irresponsible. The only reason I'm doing 90% is because I didn't have much money in my super fund and have more assets outside, enough to be comfortable.

He actually surprised me. Vee is usually pretty knowledgeable about things on the net but he seemed completely oblivious of Bitcoin. He's by no means dumb, he's both a lawyer and a medical doctor in Romania. Like myself and most others, we did not have a clue what Bitcoin was because of blatant lies from the MSM. I heard about BTC in 2010 on a short documentary that told me it was a Ponzi scheme where the early adopters got rich. Because of that I avoided Bitcoin until early 2017!
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:32:03
I asked Vee (Sargon's friend) whether his colleagues have considered Bitcoin and he said he wasn't so sure about it because "it seems a bit scammy". I told him to research into Bitcoin.
Judging from this video Bitcoin will probably end up being a last option resort.

It's usually 180 days to be considered a tax resident in most countries. Slovenia is somewhat close by and has no tax on crypto. 
Yes, if you transfer a lot of gains back to France they may try to confiscate your own money. You have to be careful.

I imagine both the CME and CBOE have more cash than any other company/exchange and set it aside to counter something like that. Other commodities markets like gold, silver, uranium have been actively suppressed by the CME + CBOE and have never broken out of their hold either. The way I see it, these institutions are financial arms of the US government with virtually an infinite amount of cash set aside to make sure the USD doesn't lose its value as the world reserve currency.
Recently I've heard some hopium that institutions are quietly buying up discount Bitcoin OTC so they could sell it back to retail customers. Then later today I shuddered to think these were actually CME and CBOE just acquiring more to dump on us. Maybe it's both.
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:44:47
BTC price would get locked in as fiat is pegged to the dollar. It would become useless as a SOV or a speculative asset. 
I've thought about this hypothetical many times. It's possible, just like it's possible the government cancelling all student loan debt. That is to say it's very unlikely.

I mentioned buying Bitcoin OTC (over the counter). This does not affect the spot price.
Im not sure how they decide exactly when and where to dump but they are experts in their field.
