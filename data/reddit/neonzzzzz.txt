I'm "no one". Bought airplane tickets with BTC few days ago.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:23:04
I overpaid the fees, because BitPay's new payment method sucks, it forced me to use ~1000 sat/B fee, when there was less than 100 KiB of TX in a mempool with the fees above that.
Blockchain itself does not scale to be globally useable for small payments. We need layer 2 solutions, like LN, for that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:46:27
Trading isn't for losers, just do the proper risk management and don't risk with all BTC you have. I personally always try not to have more than 10% of my BTC's on any exchanges or other trading platforms. So, even if I would be totally stopid at some point and lose it all on over-leveraged positions, I will still have other 90%.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:31:41
What would be interesting (haven't checked myself), do they apply the same min 5 sat/B policy on bcash too...
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:46:07
I'm in BTC for a few years, still rapid price increases sometimes distracts me from the work.

@_date: 2018-01-28 22:22:13
I would suggest Samourai Wallet. Not only because of SegWit support, it has other cool features too, mainly focused on privacy.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:54:26
No, I could have got TX in the next block with a lower fee. But Bitpay+Mycelium UX sucks.

For my bitcoin node at home I bought Gigabyte Brix BXBT-2807, which is quad-core Celeron CPU, and added 8 GB RAM and 2 TB HDD. Not the most powerful thing but it has passive cooling, so no noise, and low power consumption. Total costs were about 300 EUR, if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:01:50
So, basically we could empty mempool and reduce fees by a coordinated DDoS attack on Coinbase? ;)
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:36:37
You can use Purse.IO for that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:44:18
Very likely they just want you to use at least 5 sat/B if you really want to get your TX into the next block, even with the empty mempool. That's their right to do so.
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:03:15
@_date: 2019-07-26 07:52:49
No, they don't.
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:51:53
Of course, for plausible deniability it's better to use throwaway wallet for in between hop, that you delete from your device(s) afterwards.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:33:51
No, they should also need to convince most of the nodes to upgrade their software with such changes.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:19:08
Definitely both.
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:41:52
Yes, true. But. I'm not familiar with KeePass, but it would be normal that device itself checks if update is signed with proper keys. Even iPhone does that with every update.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:35:24
I guess not 100% correct, huge price increases could distract some hodling coders from coding.

Unfortunatelly, currently. But they have said to have plans to expand globally in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:08:25
As I said, I'm not familiar with KeePass. I assume device itself has some firmware already into it when it's shipped to you and device itself verifies every update, is it signed.

Nobody should blindly follow anything anybody say in trading. These are just opinions. You should do your own research and analysis too.
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:23:57


No, not by itself. But Schnorr can make [CoinJoin]( transactions cheaper in the future.


CT isn't the only way how to hide amounts in on-chain transactions. Technique called [PayJoin]( (pay-to-end-point), which is a variant of CoinJoin, can be used for such purpose too. Does not require any changes in Bitcoin base protocol and is already possible today. Currently supported by [JoinMarket]( and Samourai Wallet.


It will not hide anything. In the simplest way, involving only channel opening, single LN transaction and channel closing, on-chain you will have channel opening transaction (sending funds from address A to HTLC address B) and channel closing transaction (sending all funds from HTLC address B to address C).
LN only provides privacy for individual LN payments itself. Usually channel closing transaction will send part of the funds of HTLC (payment channel) address to address C (LN node 1 wallet address), part to the address D (LN node 2 wallet address), but chain analysis will have no idea, how much payments and forwardings have been made between channel opening and closing and their details.
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:31:22


Really? Haven't checked lately, but some time ago BTC withdrawal fees from Bitstamp was zero. Are they really adding fees for BTC withdrawals? Since when?
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:31:03
Confidental transactions aren't the only idea how to make amounts private. Another way is using PayJoin (Pay-to-endpoint). 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:10:05
None of Bitcoin full node software implements LN by itself. LN is implemented on top of that. In case of bitcoind/bitcoin-qt, you can use c-lightning.
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:44:54
Depends on a country where you live, but outside USA you can try hodlhodl.com for in-person cash deals. Also Bisq is an option. But I don't think you will find anything to buy with a debit card, all such platforms will require you to be 18 and verify ID.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:42:43
When using default apps provided by hardware wallet manufacturers, like Ledger or Trezor, it's a light client (SPV) wallet that basically gives information about all your addresses inside wallet to them. Wasabi uses different model, called client side block filtering, where it does not reveal such information to any third parties.
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:08:28
Monero itself isn't magic bullet, you can loose your privacy by not understanding what you do with simple BTC-&gt;XMR-&gt;BTC swaps too.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:52:36
No, he uses lightningd (c-lightning), not LND. It does not have `feereport` command built-in, but `getinfo` always returns total fees collected.
But I have written a plug-in for c-lightning that emulates feereport of LND, requires c-lightning v0.7.1 or newer (older versions didn't save timestamps of forwards).
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:24:26
If you buy BTC in KYC exchange and then participate in CoinJoin transaction, your inputs and non-equal change outputs are visible. But adding at least one transaction hop in between should give you plausible deniability.

Why ETH not XMR? Also, is an option.

CT are more expensive than ordinary TX (both in size and computing power required to validate them) and there are risks of hidden inflation if math behind CT is broken at some point. And second is the reason why it's very likely there will never be consensus for CT in BTC. See

The same problem is in Latvia. State Revenue Service thinks of Bitcoin as a service and for now Bitcoin is not VAT exempt, unless your yearly turnover is less than 50'000 EUR (then you don't need to register as a VAT payer).

Usually it is possible to reclaim such coins, but you don't know how their systems are built.

Everything web-based is basically centralized. They can steal those coins from you at any point, for example. And there are no privacy guarantees, usually (chipmixer.com is an exception, cool concept, but the trust moment for them not to steal your coins still remains). Not so with Wasabi or JoinMarket, where you control your BTC all the time, and layer 2 protocols are used, so that multiple parties can coordinate in creating single mixing transaction.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:46:32
It will wear out your SD card fast.
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:29:53
I think there was some issues with Tor today, not directly related to Wasabi itself.
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:27:57
If you don't want to be traceable, best is to not use AML/KYC exchanges at all. Buy bitcoins from ATMs or friends or using services like HodlHodl.com or Bisq, with cash. Then look at the JoinMarket, Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet, these are wallets built to increase your privacy.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:54:38
I would suggest either Bitstamp.net, if you are OK with AML/KYC, or try hodlhodl.com.

Only two ways of earning passive income from BTC where you don't give up control of your BTC (private keys) I'm aware of are running Lightning Network node or running JoinMarket's yield generator bot.
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:21:53
It depends from a wallet software you are using. Not all wallets allow to do that.
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:10:59
@_date: 2018-10-20 00:04:02
That! And another way to earn some passive income, which requires Bitcoin full node, is running JoinMarket yield generator bot.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:32:03
It's been around since 2015. 
But it requires Bitcoin Core full node currently.
Here's some demo - 
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:29:28
It has around 0.1 BTC minimum. But you can use JoinMarket for smaller amounts.
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:08:12
JoinMarket is software you install on your computer. You don't send BTC anywhere, they stay in your JM wallet, where you control the private keys. All mixing happens without trusting your coins to 3rd parties at any moment.
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:48:54
Most often it's accepted by somebody in a few hours for me.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:30:42


Wow! I haven't seen these in Latvia for something like 15 years at least.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:00:47
You should use decentralized mixing solutions, like JoinMarket or Wasabi, not some centralized dark web mixers.
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:01:33


Ohh, I completely disagree with this. For 99% of wifes around it's more easy to get access to your bank account's history than to analyze blockchain. In fact, I think it's another use case of Bitcoin - if you are married and want to buy something for some other woman online, it's better to use Bitcoin than credit card. As with access to your Internet bank your wife will see not only dates and amounts of purchases, but also merchants.

Roger has invested in them, I guess they have no big choice there. But, at the same time, they at least have done full SegWit integrating, both in Purse.io and their BTC full node implementation bcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-31 18:48:23
No, you will able to tell, they will still have multiple inputs, just less bytes for signatures, so they will be cheaper and you will have incentive to do coinjoins not only for privacy but also to save on fees.
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:46:02
Amounts should be fixed in BTC not USD before sending.
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:42:47
You should be running full node with Monero too, if you want to have the best privacy.
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:28:43
Just avoid custodial mixers. Use Wasabi Wallet or JoinMarket.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:14:33
It's always recommended to transfer coins to your wallet where you control your private keys. While they sit on exchange that's like your bank account - not real money. But you must be sure to create backups and not lose your private keys as there will be no way to recover your money in case of loss of private keys. I prefer full node Bitcoin Core wallets on my PCs, but I guess easer will be to use something like Mycelium on your mobile phone, which will give you initial seed passphrase when setting up which you must write down on a paper and store in a safe location, which will be needed if you lost your phone and want to restore wallet afterwards.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:37:29

No need for social engineering here, there are a lot of possibilities your wife can see your bank transaction history, for example, you print it on paper to give to some other institution (you may need this to get loan in some other bank, for example) or you just don't log out from your Internet bank and go to the toilet or something.

Insane fees? Last time I checked it was about 3% for credit card purchases. You will have even bigger fees if buying from Bitcoin ATMs or using Localbitcoins with cash (5% or more).
It would depend on where are you located, but here in Europe, if you don't have any friends from which to buy in person, easiest and cheapest way would be to register at Bitstamp, Coinbase or other exchange and then send SEPA bank wire transfer (costs 36 cents in my bank) to exchange.

I recently set up a new node using [Gigabyte GB-BACE-3150]( in which I installed 8 GB RAM and 2 TB 2,5" HDD. It cost about 300 EUR in total. Not the cheapest way by the hardware costs, but I liked it because of a low power consumption (it has M3150 quad core Celeron CPU with power consumption less than 10W). It's more than enough. Besides I plan to use it for some other stuff too, not run it just as a Bitcoin node.
AFAIK in many countries Internet connection could also be a potential problem. Where I live I have 100 Mbps unlimited connection for about 10 EUR per month, so that's not an issue for me.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:43:57
Yes, mainnet, testnet and regtest use separate data directories.

Good alternative to LocalBitcoins is HodlHodl.com.
@_date: 2018-10-20 00:06:43
You are not required to open port and allow incoming connections to run a fully validating node. Your node will connect to 8 random other nodes with open ports. Also you can in addition run it as a Tor hidden service, that will allow other nodes behind Tor to connect to you.

1. At least some time ago from [Bitnovo]( you got some Spanish MasterCard with "No requiere ID" written on it. Top-up with Bitcoin.
2. Guess you could just buy a lot of pre-paid cards. If you are in a country, where you can do that without showing your ID. That's possible in Latvia and you could get them as cheap as 1 EUR per SIM card last time I checked.

Until electricity costs for mining 1 BTC will be less than a price of 1 BTC in fiat, mining electricy consumption will increase. There is nothing to solve in a protocol level. It's a feature, not a bug, bigger electricity consumption increases network's security. The most secure PoW chain is the one with biggest electricity consumption.

I had also experience with shitty Coinbase merchant service and Expedia. But I didn't sent even 2nd TX, contacted Expedia support immediately, got my refund to Coinbase and booked hotel again, this time choosing to pay with cash at check-in instead.
I'm not sure they really want 1 confirmation, seeing TX should be enough, but they didn't see it. In my case, there was 50 minute period without any confirmed Bitcoin blocks at that moment.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:19:17

@_date: 2018-06-06 13:36:33
Saving fiat in a bank account is not very smart nowadays, even if you are not into cryptocurrencies.
I have my savings mostly in Bitcoin, but also have some physical silver and cash at home. Also I follow local stock market of my country, but don't have any active positions there right now, sold what I had recently.
@_date: 2019-08-30 23:53:59
It depends on amount. It's not worth buying hardware wallet if the amount is small, for example, 0.01 BTC or less. In that case just using something like Electrum on PC or Blockstream Green on mobile could be a good start.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:02:43
Yes, I have.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:27:22

@_date: 2019-08-27 00:37:19
It's bad with iOS wallets. Probably Blockstream Green is the best. I also have Mycelium, which don't have SegWit and has other problems on iOS, but have cool feature of possibility to create multiple subaccounts (helps for privacy) and also can be used in rare cases I need to pay for merchants using BitPay (AirBaltic).
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:08:15
Yes, IMHO it could be a good idea, have thoughts about that in past too. Only think that initially you would not make a lot of money with such service as there aren't so many stores accepting Bitcoin only currently. But this may change in future. Another issue could be that banks very often don't want to do business with a Bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:46:42


I would suggest using some CoinJoin software to mix them before sending to a hardware wallet. Currently [Wasabi Wallet]( might be the easiest way. But note that it supports only new type of BTC addresses called bech32 (start with bc1...) for receiving, not all old wallets / exchanges support them yet, so you might need to use some other wallet as a hop between buyer and Wasabi Wallet, if his wallet does not support sending to bech32.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:44:28
There is also Go implementation of Lightning Network by Lightning Labs called LND.
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:06:25
It should be something easy to use, for example, mobile application where you scan Bitcoin QR code and then pay with a credit card or banklink.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:24:39
They are the same coins. LN works by exchanging signed BTC transactions P2P between participiants, just not sending them to the Bitcoin network and recording into blockchain, until you decide to close a channel. But it is not sidechain or something like that, so there are no BTC vs LN BTC.

Yes, it is. My point was that it is dumb to store your fiat as just fiat (EUR/USD/whateva) in account as a savings, because it will lose it's value over time.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:52:54
There are ways to earn Bitcoin too, by selling your time, knowledge, services for it, just like most of the people do to get fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:37:16
It's not "maybe". If somebody will run a node with a different ruleset and will have enough mining power to produce a block, other nodes will reject it, hardfork will happen and he will be split off from the rest of the network. That's the whole point of Bitcoin - everybody can run the node and validate every transaction, including coinbase transactions that produce new bitcoins.

LN is a payment network on top of Bitcoin blockchain, SegWit was just protocol change in base protocol.
Try installing Blue Wallet on your mobile phone, it has both on-chain and LN wallets. But LN wallet is custodial there, so there are the trust issue. But it's good start, later you could move on to proper LN wallet.

Yes, Bitpay sucks. I have Mycelium in my iPhone for that. Bitcoin Core and Electrum also is supported, but I've heard Bitpay has problems with wallets running behind Tor, which is how I prefer to use Bitcoin on my computers.
But I would suggest to not use Coinbase as a wallet too. It is not a Bitcoin wallet actually, more like a Bitcoin bank. Use it to buy Bitcoins, if you want, but afterwards send them out to wallet where you control your private keys.

There is no reason for people to not produce and use more miners if cost of mining 1 BTC is less than a price of 1 BTC. And it is the same for all PoW cryptocurrencies.

I don't think it is a right way to try to convince somebody to accept BTC if they don't want to. Do the opposite instead - prefer to accept BTC from others, even probably by providing some small discount if they send you BTC instead of fiat (because you will not need to do conversion from fiat to BTC later yourself).

@_date: 2019-06-07 09:40:40


Not 100% true. For example, any wallet that you can configure to connect to your own full node, like Blockstream Green on Android or Electrum with your own EPS, aren't SPV. Also, wallets that use Bitcoin Core as a node, but not wallet, like JoinMarket, and also there are alternative full node implementations.

No, Bitcoin blockchain has the most hashpower behind it, so it is the most immutable blockchain and so the most secure way for trusted timestamping. But there is L2 protocol called [OpenTimestamps]( that actually allows to store virtually unlimited number of such proofs in a single OP_RETURN output (with single hash) in a Bitcoin blockchain, so that would be more effective way of doing this.

The exact amount, very likely. You can, of course, bet on this, I just want to explain, that it's not so private and anonymous, as you may think.
If you go Monero path, I would suggest splitting everything into multiple transactions, combining and splitting them when in XMR. And either do initial BTC-&gt;XMR in a multiple transactions or do XMR-&gt;BTC in a multiple transactions, so that amounts differ. And of course, never reuse BTC addresses. And always be behind Tor. These would be the basics.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:17:28
Yes, I would like to see some competition there too. So far all the other options I have checked, like Bitstamp and Paybis, have bigger commisions on credit cards, compared to Coinbase. And sometimes I want instant buy with best price available, without waiting for SEPA bank wire transfer to clear.
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:18:13
For BTCD maybe, there is still no census for merging Neutrino support into Bitcoin Core. Yes, it can work without bitcoind nodes serving filters (and Wasabi Wallet already uses it on mainnet, they serve filters from their own servers), but most of the full nodes run Bitcoin Core, so it will not be so useable as it could be.

You don't "build a mixer". You are one of the parties involved in CoinJoin transaction(s). It's like using a mixer, just decentralized, so more private (centralized mixers can log all the transactions with all participant IP addresses, for example).
Note that using BTC-&gt;XMR-&gt;BTC isn't very private by itself, it has some issues, you should know what you are doing. For example, if you just use single transaction to convert BTC to XMR, then single XMR to XMR transaction and then single XMR to BTC transaction, you can still be deanonymized by the amount correlation in the first and last BTC transaction (thus it's traceable).
More user friendly alternative for CoinJoin's currently is [Wasabi Wallet]( but it has minimum required amount of ~0.1 BTC.

No. Open port is needed only for others to make connections to your node and open channels to you. But you can instead open channels to other nodes by yourself. Channel balances are important, you should have funds in a both ends of a channel (when you open channel to other node, initially all the funds in that channel are at your side) to participate in routing other payments.

NFC would be just other method of transfer for long numbers, as is QR codes today. There is no problem to do it technically. And no need to get rid of QR codes to do it via NFC too. I would still prefer QR codes, as it is more secure, but I understand that NFC would be more popular with general public likely, as they are used to use that with contactless payment cards, for example. Although, when I discussed that some time ago, somebody told me that in China QR codes are used extensively, instead of NFC payments, for existing payment systems. So, if average Chinese can do it, probably average Westerner can too.

Developments to increase Bitcoin fungibility do not make coloured coins and things like that impossible. You can still use Bitcoin as before, just people are trying to figure out various ways to increase privacy (and thus fungibility as a side effect), but you are not forced to use them.

CoinJoin transactions usually have 2 or more identically sized outputs (49 currently for Wasabi, JoinMarket defaults to 4 to 6), that's the point. So, if you get 9,8 BTC out of the CoinJoin, n other parties get identical amount too. So, nobody can be sure, which 9,8 BTC is yours.

Your own hot wallet vs trusting third party has completely different risks involved. Better comparison would be keeping funds on LN channels vs running JoinMarket yield generator bot. Both are hot wallets you control. Also, it matters, do you just want to earn interest or are using it to send / receive BTC via LN yourself. In LN node your funds are locked in channels, with JoinMarket it's ordinary UTXO's you can spend on-chain anytime.

Yes, you can never be sure that transaction that looks like a CoinJoin is actually a CoinJoin transaction. For example, it could be a fake CoinJoin (one person mixing with himself). The fact that CoinJoin exists and is possible is enough to never be sure that in any transaction with multiple inputs and outputs all the inputs come from the same entity (that's the only assumption made in Bitcoin whitepaper which was proven to be wrong). Usually CoinJoin transactions have two or more indentical amount outputs, otherwise they do not make much sense, as they can be very easily deanonymized with amount analysis.

If you convert BTC to XMR in a single transaction and then XMR back to BTC also in a single transaction, to a single address, amounts can be correlated.

No. They aren't faster. They just could be in magnitudes more efficient at some things, like breaking elliptic curve cryptography (which Bitcoin uses for deriving public key from a private key). But hash functions is not that case, effeciency only grows by square root (must efficient known way for quantum computers is [Groover's algorithm](

Exchange will have information about you then. You should use anonymous exchange like ShapeShift via Tor then. But three simple BTC-&gt;XMR, XMR-&gt;XMR and XMR-&gt;BTC transactions will not be enough, as the BTC-&gt;XMR and XMR-&gt;BTC transactions can be linked together by the amounts.
Also, if XMR security is broken at some point in the future, it could be used to deanonymize you later. Bitcoin with CoinJoin is safer from that perspective, as it is simple technique, without advanced crypto.

Hardware wallet, [Ledger Nano S]( or [Trezor]( will be the most secure way for a non-technical person. Then read official manuals of specific wallet, how to use it. Very import - buy them only from official site, not from eBay or somewhere else, to be sure you get genuine wallet.

I disagree, for privacy you currently need to run full node over Tor. All SPV wallets request information from other parties which may help linking together different addresses in your wallet.

Probably, but P2SH address does not automatically mean it's SegWit.

You can reuse addresses, but that's not the recommended practice. Only reason to do so, that comes into my mind, is if you want to publish that address somewhere, so people can donate you money.

@_date: 2018-02-10 16:07:30
You should always change addresses, never reuse them. There are no benefits in reusing addresses, except for accepting donations.
But even not reusing addresses does not guarantee anything. There are various techniques of linking different addresses of the same wallet together, blockchain analysis companies do that. But some average Joe you send to / receive from most likely will not be able to do that.

If your SPV wallet always connects to node you control, then it's ok.  But that means you are running full node. But otherwise the server you connect to can connect your addresses together.

From satellite you can receive blocks. But you need some other communications channel for your transaction broadcast.

@_date: 2019-09-06 23:24:11
I do believe too such attack would not be practical. You should somehow convince 51% of existing miners to participate in it, as you can't build facilities with such a big hashpower fast, get required electricity, etc... Miners who already operate big mining facilities will think more long term (except if majority is mining at the loss already and looking for some exit strategy, but I don't think that's the case currently).

I would probably go for running bitcoind on RPi (you can use some USB flash drive for block storage in pruned mode, to not wear out SD card fast) and then hack some simple Python script (or even bash) that requests new address after each deposit and displays QR code.

@_date: 2019-09-10 16:51:24

First, address reuse is bad. Always use different receiving address for each transaction.
You can't do most about your past transactions, where address you shared with other people are invovled. But you can do better in the future.

As an investor, so far positive. Try to diversify your investments into a lot of small ones and you should be safe. Of course, look at credit ratings, person's history, etc... Also notice that there are both bitcoin and fiat (tied to fiat/BTC exchange rates) loans.

@_date: 2018-04-17 16:08:23
It they would be serious about this, they would be accepting Bitcoin, as all other XXX sites accepting cryptocurrencies do.

I would say hodlhodl.com, but I assume you are from USA (as you mentioned dollars), and it's the only country in the world where it's not available.

It already exists, it's called CoinJoin. No single BIP, as it's generic idea, there are various ways to implement it.

That's why nobody mines BTC with GPUs anymore. When new generation of ASICs comes out, previous are slowly turned off, because they aren't cost / energy efficient anymore. So, it's not completely 1:1 relation, but basically bigger energy consumption means more money spent and bigger hashrate, so potential attacks will also cost more.
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:17:12
Yes. That's why you always say "accepting credit cards" or "accepting Visa", not "accepting money".

Dooh. It's hard to read?




This works only for Coinbase users, so it's not "accepting Bitcoin" anymore then.

Yes, you can. But hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor could be a better choice for you. It isn't so easy to manage and secure paper wallets properly.

As friend of me said - there are more cars going to Suntaži (small countryside village in Latvia) than BCH transactions. :D

It was buggy anyway, had problems most of the time I tried tipping in YouTube.

So now we can say to Roger that "BTC has positive merchant adoption, BCH has negative merchant adoption"? :)

If not better, then always safer, less risky.

Because as price of BTC in USD terms went up, people starting to care more about sat/B fees.

Bitnovo has balance in EUR, not BTC. Crypto (BTC or DASH) is converted to EUR when you top-up.

Latvia. Maybe that's some kind of limitation for a new accounts? I have no prior experience with Neteller.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:10:49
This looks big!
I had idea to suggest Betsafe to accept Bitcoin deposits, but now it is not so important, as I will be able to do that using Neteller now. Main point - 0% fee, if compared to other deposit options, like Visa / MasterCard. Not so important for withdrawals, as they do SEPA bank transfers for free.
Thing I don't like is "487.50 EUR lifetime limit". 
Also, couldn't test it right now, got error message that deposits are temporary disabled.

They didn't use Bitcoin previously. Not sure for how long their Bitcoin scheme is operating.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:14:09
Year 2038 problem exists when UNIX time is stored as 32-bit signed integer. Most older UNIX systems did that way, nowadays 64-bit signed integer is most often used instead. But POSIX standard actually does not say, should time_t be signed or unsigned. If you use 32-bit unsigned integer instead, you have one extra bit and it will overflow 68 years later. QNX 6 operating system, for example, used that.
There are possible fixes without moving to 64-bit integer. For example, you could use some block version bit to specify different starting date/time for a timestamp.
Probably, not using different starting date/time for timestamps in Bitcoin is one little think that could have been done better from the start. There was no point in timestamps before year 2009. Then we could have room for extra 39 years here. That's common practice, for example, Telit GPS/GPRS modules uses timestamps with starting date 2000-01-01.

Simplest way: bank A sends cash to exchange A -&gt; buys bitcoins in exchange A for fiat -&gt; transfers to bank B bitcoin address in exchange B -&gt; bank B sells bitcoins for fiat in exchange B -&gt; cashout. Slowest parts would be sending fiat money to/from exchanges.

Apart from centralized communications channel (IRC), JoinMarket is decentralized too. People providing coins for mixing hold their private keys.

What a surprise! Russian official propaganda channel predicts the death of Bitcoin.

Fees itself can't be dropping. Is something that can be specified for each transaction. Likely fee estimator of the wallet you are using isn't good. Best advice - use wallet that allows to manually specify fee to use for each transaction.

From crypto, 100% BTC. Otherwise would diversify BTC, physical gold, equities / ETFs.

It's still going AFAIK. But BTC has smart contracts it self. RSK just offers ETH compatible smart contracts with BTC instead of ETH as a unit of account.

Probably you should try [c-lightning]( instead of lnd?
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:57:47
Lightning can be used for larger purchases too. Just for smaller purchases, like cup of coffee, the benefits are bigger, because of on-chain tx fees. For example, I recently bought ticket to HCPP19 using Lightning, which cost around 200 EUR.

Fees will usually be less than 0,003% per anonimity set in JoinMarket, especially for bigger amounts. And you can even earn the fees, not pay, if you are market maker and are ready to wait some time for your coins to mix with others. But anonimity sets for individual CJ transactions will be smaller.
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:24:43
As long as we don't have unlimited free processing power and unlimited free storage space, every transaction on a blockchain has to have a price.

I sometimes use Purse.io to order from Amazon.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:55:29
So it needs consensus from the majority running full nodes.
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:39:18
Luke's ideas about blocksize has nothing to do with Knots. He isn't pushing for any changes without consensus.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:24:35
Ok, yes, if code is added that maximum block weight changes with time / blockheight. But then you anyway need a big number of nodes upgrading, else I would not call it Bitcoin if it has both minority in node count and minority in hashpower.
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:02:46
It's never enough!

The video is more about concept, that it will not work in a long term, they will be kicked out from other platforms or those other platforms will be kicked out from Paypal or Visa/MasterCard. As Gab example shown, you can't even use centralized BTC payment processors, like Bitpay, they will also disconnect you. Only way is to accept Bitcoin yourself, using BTCPay or some other way. And that is a real use case for Bitcoin in the Western world.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:09:57
They could not issue any Tether at all without buying some BTC, because Omni protocol that's behind Tether runs on BTC blockchain and they need to pay transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:19:29
It would require consensus from a majority of a mining hashpower. Otherwise reduced block weight chain will not be a longest PoW chain.
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:23:26
It's open source. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:10:56
I don't think reducing block weight could ever happen, there will be no consensus.

Problems caused by bigger blocks now might not be a problems in ten years. With a time, hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, average speeds of Internet connections also increases.

Knots isn't different implementation (it's Core with bunch of patches on top of it), bcoin, btcd and libbitcoin are.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:46:43
How it's the same? If the majority of hashpower continues to mine bigger blocks than allowed in a new rules, old nodes, that hasn't upgraded, will go with that chain instead of the other chain with smaller blocks. Or you mean as an UASF, so that majority of miners will accept this change because most of the users go with it?
@_date: 2018-12-31 20:00:17
Yes, is available, but terrible UI/UX.
