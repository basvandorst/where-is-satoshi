Arbitrage only works with faster coin networks such as litecoin. Bitcoin is too slow.

This guy is a sham an absolute sham. How do I know? I live under his rule.
@_date: 2018-10-01 13:21:45
What about XMR? This guy was accused of siphoning money into a panama account called Egrant, money which he got by doing corrupt dealings like buying overpriced oil from his Azerbaijan buddies.
They never found any money transfers that lead him to the panama account, but he could have easily been paid in crypto such as Monero and then cashed it out via an exchange such as bitfinex before it was forced to be regulated.
He seems a bit too savvy with blockchain technology, something unusual for your typical Maltese politician.

bitcoin is legal but hardly anyone uses it here, we are a cash based society.

So it's mathematically impossible for BTC to go down below $2000?

I hope it will reach $10,000 but I'm not holding my breath
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:02:19
Can't wait!
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:31:06
it was from coinbase, maybe they are the problem?
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:39:25
Probably, but that's not something I worry about as we only get raises in workloads. Funny how nobody asks me to share that with them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:38:25
thanks bro
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:56:23


In fact the more reasonable co-workers politely asked me on how they can buy bitcoins at cheap fees. One of them made big gains when he bought half a bitcoin at the dip. I did not walk up to him and say "hey bro you should be giving me some of your profits as I am the one who introduced you to bitcoin", instead I just gave him a pat in the back and I was happy for him. He was going to say exactly how much he made, but I gave him a stern warning to keep it a secret unless he wants to deal with the freeloaders as I reluctantly did. He agreed and we rarely talk about bitcoin unless there is a large price fluctuation.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:14:54
I'm from Malta, a tiny island where everyone wants to know the intricate details of your affairs and yet they want to keep theirs secret. As for work, I'm an engineer in the manufacturing sector so have to deal with low wage earners.

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:12:42
What caused the sudden spike? I think there is definitely market manipulation going on. It stays at a relatively constant price for hours then boom, the price jolts in a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:00:45
It may be government sponsored. They said something about embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology on a national scale.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:37:42


Yep, hit the nail on the head. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:31:02
Probably and early adopter who made his riches. Good luck to him. I had a chance to buy a couple hundred bitcoins back when it cost almost nothing. I said "nah, this is bullshit money" Worst decision of my life. Ah well...such is life.

Ask the Venezuelans if it's helping them or not.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:42:16
I never made such a promise and they are not my friends but co-workers and I never go out drinking with co-workers, I only go out alone. They simply tried to trick me into giving them money with a trick that has an almost zero % chance of working, but hey I guess it was worth a shot for them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:09
Just before it soared for a few minutes to around $7900, this is insane!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:33:32
Maybe try a local bitcoin club
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:35
It's over 9000 pounds!
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:32:43
Probably not, people don't know much about bitcoin where I live. Some even call it "hacker's money"
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:15:32
Sure as soon as it hits $9000 post an angry Vegeta image, then do it again when it hits about $10740 for us euros. We'll do the rest

Just wait till the chinese wake up, massive correction incoming. In the meantime buy a few litecoins as they are likely to jump in price during the bitcoin correction. Sell off the appreciated LTC when BTC starts the price climb.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:57:59
Well many would sell like crazy at that point. I had a few open positions and closed them all as soon it hit $7960 as you could see a major sell wall at $8000. That's just how crypto markets work. Buy at dips and sell close to the ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:52:59
Based on my rather lousy analysis of the daily chart, during a big correction it tends to go down by half the distance between the ATH and the floor of the last major correction. 
The floor of the last major correction was around $5464 (Kraken) and the the current ATH is $9388 (Kraken). Hence I'm assuming a floor of around $7500
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:36:15
Haha caught me red handed, at least I'm not a loser in bitcoin. having said that it's pretty easy to make money in a bullish market.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:18:27
maybe I'd give him 100 dogecoins
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:15:16
I don't really want to be a millionaire, I just want free beer for life. If bitcoin can do that for me than I would be a very happy man.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:13:59
Nah I work as an engineer in the manufacturing industry. The people who asked for handouts earn less than I do.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:24
at $7500
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:24:36
I have been asking the same question, how will the high transaction fees issue be resolved? By the looks of it litecoin is a better means of payment as it is cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:09:41
He has a point. When a nation defaults the banks can take hold of your money. With bitcoin and other cryptos they can't steal your money if you hold onto a well hidden private key. I'm basically keeping 1/3 of my wealth in cryptos, the other 1/3 in cash money and the final 1/3 in the bank.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:01:14
he's your cryptodad
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:54:43


We wait till it is over 9000 euros.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:32:07
that's what I did. I did not mention any cuss words in this post to keep it clean.

pretty much
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:27:42
Seems like a good plan.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:45:08
with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:10:44
Next stop: over 9000 euros!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:37:34
I know it's insane. As the price dropped to 6200, 6100 and then 6000 euro I started buying on high margin knowing that eventually it will be back up. I got to make some money out of it now that it's starting the climb. Two of my positions are suddenly making money.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:08:40
I'm not going
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:01:01
yep, pretty much so
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:43
Massive correction inbound.

you still have 0.25 bitcoin in your wallet, are you sure you did not send anything to 3N8oiA58dcx7RMm45CrR4Y5rkY4GL4xTBZ, 	3MyssoAVHFPYPcF8FRjkRn99G5i2rvE8eb, 	3NkbamRoYpbtQt7X6HEf8eh2BR9eNEsv3Q  and the rest?

@_date: 2017-11-27 11:21:22
Hold on bro, I need to post my own when it goes over 9000 euros.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:28:54
Split it among 3 exchanges so if one goes down, you only lose 3,333 dollars. As soon as you get your coins get them out a cold storage wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:59:01
same here I can't login, everyone should upvote this post so that it can be seen on the top and people would know what a crap exchange they are maybe then they will change
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:47:45
Yeah I'm so gonna buy litecoin when it drops to below $50 in the coming days. It has a habit of going back to $55 afterwards. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:56:22
Yep, I'm only using it to buy monero during the night when traffic is down. Use gdax for XBT.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:53:54
Hope so, can wait for it to reach $10,740 as that equals to over 9000 euros.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:59:39
It will explode more than it already has. A weak dollar would drive people to buy bitcoin and use it for payments. I myself am buying bitcoin/litecoin as a countermeasure against a possible collapse in the euro.

Buy the dips, last time I bought was it went down to $5500 on kraken. If it goes down to at least $7500 I'm buying more.

What's behind the recent push in price? Sorry for the ultra noob question. After recovering my losses from last week's fall in price I'm a bit reluctant to have any more money in bitcoin.

What is your public address so we can have a look and better understand your problem?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:03:40
and is 37Cw9rfSZ8GY3VAYHER4mitTA6QuDJKfvk your exchange wallet or the cryptopay wallet?
If it is your exchange wallet it could be that the exchange is simply shifting your funds from one wallet to another, but your account still has control over the funds. If that address is your cryptopay wallet, you need to get those 0.25 btc off there and into a paper wallet ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:53:36
World's most expensive pint of beer? I think we are past that point to be honest. That was back in the day were bitcoins were worth almost nothing and only a few thousands of people on this plant actually believed in them. People saying that the price of a bitcoin can reach a million dollars in x amount of years is just pure speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:52


Yeah as if bro, as much as I like that to be true you can forget about such prices.
