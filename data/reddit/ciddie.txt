" Why I was targeted
The best working theory for why I was targeted was this tweet I made last week about [Coinbase.com](
There is absolutely no reason at all to paint a massive target on your back, and i would go further and say if you are actively encouraging the opposite you are part of the problem.

But also every payment validates it as a good source of nefarious activity that leads to another poor schmuck getting stung.. that said i guess there is culpability in having an insecure network and no backups!

Great idea! would be nice to see bitcoin and bitcoin lightning side by side when its live.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:14:03
Good luck.....

You'd have to pay capital gains tax once you go over your 11kish tax free amount, which if you're a basic rate tax payer is 18%, and goes up to 28% once you get over into the higher earnings bracket.

As per below see 3.1: 
This info was given to me by my qualified accountant.. who also hodls btc :)

There really is no guarantee that even if you send the ransom they will release the key to unlock the files, whats more likely is that they will just ask for more money.

If you look at average "wake up"  / "get to office" times across the globe, there are probably times at 2am for you that are 9am elsewhere where trading will recommence.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:38:30
i dont think employment status matters, you have a capital gains tax allowance of just over 11k which you can draw without paying tax on.
The next 34k you draw will be taxed at the lower rate, then you move into higher rate of 28%.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:18:20
as Lopp put it, short bitcoin and you'll just get rekt

It's a metric of increasing adoption/investment/interest though and i'm down with getting excited about that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:49
In the UK under 18s have less of a tax free exemption amount (6.5k as opposed to circa 11k), so age does matter to a degree here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:29:55
Under 18s is £6,475 i believe, so you'd be paying 20% after the first £1500 pounds or so

Let me put this a different way, i know of companies that have paid and then extorted further, it does happen.
They aren't customers they are being defrauded by thieves.
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:30:53
In $ what would that be for end of 2018 and end of 2019?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:23:06
Depends on your circumstances, ie are you in full time employement/how much of your tax free amount are you already using
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:32:30
i guess the odds of guessing are 24^24 which is an insanely high number
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:51:20
It's classed as shares/investments not property, so the rates are 18% and 28% for basic, and then higher rate respectively.
See 3.1:

What happened?

It was shilled by the same people that shilled bitconnect. (Cryptonick, Ryan Hildreth et al), as far as I'm aware it operates on a similar system of referreral based bonuses and so is just another MLM ponzi scheme. There's probably not even any mining actually happening.

Honestly if they claiming to offer 0.5 btc its almost certainly fake.

" I think the asymptote is somewhere around $130 trillion but only maybe $100 billion will be crypto"
I assume thats a typo..

Yes there is:

Was going to ask the same thing, how does going nearly 10x equate to less than 10%

The significance of patterns is the predictability of future events, but their cause could be many things depending on the pattern.. this particular one has had more exposure to market trading than in the past so it may be reasonable to use this knowledge to narrow down the potential outcomes.
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:37:09
Just because one particular event (black swans in your example) might be difficult to predict with any sort of meaningful pattern, doesn't render all of them useless.
For instance Earthquake prediction is a huge part of geology and actually saves lives, Geologists infer patterns from previous events and use that information to reliably predict where and when future ones may occur.
"Information is not real even if it exists", I'm struggling with that statement. Information is our understanding/interpretation of real world facts, so i'm not sure how you can state that its either real or existing.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:06:17
Agree, it's a self-fulfilling echo chamber

Not coming into the coins though is it.
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:46:49
It's just a bet on what the price does. Unless you are suggesting its a good thing that it will be even more heavily manipulated than it is right now
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:06:15
Long term you are dead on, but just for this current period this large impulse up may not be such a good thing.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:08:09
Most altcoins are paired with btc anyway so they track it to some extent
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:12:12
Some really good points here but i do feel like there is a space for altcoins to exist, that can peacefully coexist and compliment BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:31:59
I know right... it's had a bandaid thrown at it and we're told that it's "the solution".  when frankly if it had the adoption people want it to have it, will fall over again because (ironically) it's an absolute solution and not a relative/scaling one.
The other thing that gets me.. why appropriate the ticker? It's BCH.. use /BCH? /shrug 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:16:10
It's basically a real world attempt at a 51% attack.
There may be a case for bigger block sizes being better, there may be a case for lightning to be better, there is absolutely no case for forking off a coin and co-opting its brand by hostile takeover.
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:11:15
actually bonded DSL is a thing and it sucks, it's a meme and its (correctly) showing that an \*absolute\* solution to a relative problem is really not the answer.
