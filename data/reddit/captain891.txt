I wouldn't doubt it, I think most people predicted a bear market after the markets opened until they made their money from the bets and accumulated tons of coin
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:14:19
This is pure fud. There is so many "hair dresser" stories that have been popping up its just hilarious at this point. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:29:50
Exactly, everyone relax. Those that bought in high, keep calm and hodl on. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:32
No I don't but I've been in crypto long enough to recognize bear traps and we are in one. It could go lower but buying here makes more sense then all those noobs buying in at above 17k chasing fomo. I don't recall posts of "don't buy its too high!" back then... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:23:18
You don't know that this isnt the floor 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:49:14
Maybe a few people but not nearly the same amount of posts as all the panic posts here. This is a panic right now, everyone selling now will buy back higher in a few weeks or months. None the less thats just my opinion, we shall see how it plays out.

Dear noobs: Go ahead and throw TA out of the window in crypto, it means nothing. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:50:05
lol yes and Bitcoin will slowly implement fixes, it will always be the top dog

There is clear FUD being posted here and its definitely being done by the institutional investors who are behind this dump and extreme price manipulation all because of their futures bets. I've literally seen 20 different posts from different accounts saying "my barber even bought some blah blah blah".... This is pure fud to drive noobs to sell to the big boys. They know how valuable BTC will be and they are doing what they do best to pry it away from the people. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:40
Pure panic at this point, everyone that was on the fence yesterday is dumping today. They'll be back... much higher lel
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:12:14
Bufoons, panicky noobs, morons, idiots, weak hands. Plenty of names for them lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:39:34
I bet you 1 btc that it will be above 15k by mid Feb. Lets use a crypto betting system site so you can't pussy out. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:25
Buy high sell low!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:09:01
lol or you know, hold both and don't be so one sided
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:51:00
Maybe you should stop looking at only the past few weeks and look at the big picture. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:16:28
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:16:02
Yeah bro, buy high sell low. Buying low is terrible idea..
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:58
The noobs are out tonight, you guys are going to learn a big lesson in a few weeks about bear traps. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:28:05
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:45
Hype isn't over its just getting started. This is panic due to a bear trap from institutional investors trying to 1. Grab cheap coins and 2. Validiate their futures bets which end today. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:11
Maybe, from my experience and what I've seen in these markets before I think big money will buy back after the futures expire and that will cause a shift in the entire market and back to a bull market. It has happened every time after these big crashes in BTC. We will see a big green candle out of nowhere and it will start climbing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:32:01
Yeah buying low is a terrible strategy, buying high is where its at...
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:41:37
This isn't the stock market, the stock market also hasn't seen rises of the caliber of BTC either. It goes both ways. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:48:05
Futures expire today, will prob spike a bit upwards
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:39:27
Yes young noob, yes it will. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:15:11
100% truth, this is exactly what happened and those of us that aren't ignorant knew this would happen. HODL and if you sold at 9k... I'm sorry but you got played

@_date: 2018-01-17 16:50:57
SMH people convinced it was never going above 10k again
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:54:30
BTC will be 100k minimum before 2019.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:55
Brilliant 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:13:48
Penny stocks don't have the volume that BTC does or the marketcap... Thats like comparing shit alt coins that pump on cryptopia with BTC.... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:17:50
Idiots and noobs. We are in a huge bear trap right now and it always gets the noobs to sell. They will be buying back higher.

@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:33
Its not that hard, buy, put up walls, spread more fud and push price down some more. Besides they haven't bought back heavy yet, you will know when they buy back when you see the market reverse. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:22:37
I guarantee you will be back much higher lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:22:12
Also potentially has a long way to go in the other direction too. This is pure panic right now, best time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:07:05
Congrats man and welcome. Don't listen to the FUD, you are still early in all of this and got in at a great starting point.

Bought more and will keep buying if it goes lower. Cliche I know but it's true lmao 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:48:04
Anytime is a good time to buy. 10 years from now you will have wish you would have bought as much as you could. There's a lot of fud here and I get it, its going down in price and people get emotional but step back and look at the big picture, long term picture without the lies being fed to you. Crypto is the future.

@_date: 2017-10-24 11:25:50
We're getting closer to more average joes buying in. I'm seeing it mentioned on more and more commercials and stuff... Get ready folks because in a few years when everyone is buying the price will not be under 6 figures imo. Until then, enjoy the roller coaster ;)

@_date: 2017-05-27 14:16:15
Why it was just greedy people buying in at the top. I mean the price of BTC went up way too fast and everyone and their grandma knew it would correct hard. They learned a very valuable lesson, besides over time if they hold they will be fine ;)
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:14:13
Localbitcoins.com, make sure you meet the guy face to face and don't leave until its in your account.

Fuck that dude if you find those 1 or 2 BTC hold until 2020, the price right now is nothing compared to what it will be.

@_date: 2017-05-26 15:49:57
Prob less then 0.000001 % chance, if you were into Bitcoin back in 2010 you either were a computer guy who would def wipe everything clean before selling or you were buying some sweet sweet cocaine in which case you would smash the harddrive with a hammer before throwing out. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:46:09
They have a lot of volume right now and their staff is most likely overwhelmed with work especially anything that needs to be manually checked. Give it time, if you're trying to buy use other sites, if you are desperate you can buy from coinmama but they have high fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:33:05

It will rise because India is going to adopt it heavily in the next few years and its going to go parabolic. They are already phasing out their fiat currency, look how crazy it went as Japan is starting to adapt into it.

Blockchain.info is good as they don't care what you do. I have a feeling a lot of noobs are going to get rekt these coming weeks as they send btc from their coinbase accounts to gambling websites then promptly have their accounts frozen.

@_date: 2017-05-26 15:55:09
Relax man coinbase is getting insane volume and they are overwhelmed, any company would be having the same problems. You can buy from other places and if you are really desperate you can buy from coinmama but they have high fees.
