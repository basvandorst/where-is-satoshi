I'd recommend setting up on both, that way you have an easily and readily accessible alternative. Also, Gemini only does BTC/ETH/USD. Keep that in mind if you plan on using LTC and BCH (Bcash), which Coinbase/GDAX support as well.
Otherwise, converting it to BTC or ETH before sending it to Gemini is an option.

Just in case, make sure you keep your mnemonic handy!

Absolutely, that's about $750 worth if it's really 0.05 BTC, plus another $130 of BCH/Bcash.

Go check for the transaction on the Coinbase side. It'll show there and you can check the status.

Use the Bitcoin-qt clienr and wait a long time for the blockchain download. Sorry but I believe that's the only way without dealing with extracting your private keys and importing to other wallets. Also, get the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold qt wallets and do the same. Free forked coins in there for you! Make sure you load the *original* wallet.dat from 6 years ago in those as well so you can transfer out the BCH and BTH to another wallet.
I tried to load the newer wallet.dat into the BCH and BTG wallets after I sent my BTC out and it showed I sent it out already. Loading the original wallet.dat fixed that.
If you need more help with this process, me or anyone in here should be able to assist. I did this process 2 months ago successfully. 
U/bobbyb500 has the right idea as well.
Good luck!

It could be because your Greenwallet address is a Segwit address. If I'm not mistaken, GDAX/Coinbase currently don't support sending to Segwit.
