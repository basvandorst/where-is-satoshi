I agree that Gox is in "financial trouble", but I'm not sure where financial trouble turns into insolvency.  FWIW, my personal thought is that Gox lost a ton of money, tried to recover it through arbitrage when the price tanked (whether or not they tanked the price on purpose is a different issue) and was unable to fully recover - but I find it hard to believe that Gox has no money left.  
I personally think they're getting "bailed out" by an acquisition.  That, or they're sorting out how to distribute what they have left before they file for bankruptcy...time will tell...

Is this really the reason most subscribers to this sub have?  For the 1st world, I feel like bankers don't interfere with my ability to get rich.  I have much more influence on my wealth than Jamie Dimon's $2.00 non-Chase ATM fees do.  I suppose you're talking about investing, which I think is generally understood as creating value out of speculation, which at this point, many bitcoiners are guilty of.
What aspect of bitcoin to you foresee being the end to the way centralized banks function, and how will that have an impact on you getting rich?

Agreed.  And also, if they proved reputable and in fact became the best exchange over the next year or so, they would attract many new adopters that won't have heard about being "Goxxed".

Interesting...I was more suggesting that a group (cypherpunks) purposefully "lost" the private key so nobody would have access to their pre mined coins.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:47:00
Agreed.  But we are "early adopters" relatively speaking.  So my thinking is that if somebody with their shit together can get Gox up and running the right way, then they can leverage the existing user base and salvage some of the infrastructure to create potentially the best exchange we've seen to date.  The name "Gox" wouldn't mean much to future adopters (think 2+ years from now) except a name associated with a company that provides a useful service...
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:56:17
I agree the name is tainted.  I personally think Gox has already been acquired, but when the "crisis management" document was leaked, I think whoever bought them took a step back and said "we need to find a new way to do this so that we can create a clear distinction between Gox and our new entity" - which is why we're seeing such a long delay in announcements from Karpeles and Gox in general.

I don't think Alex did a good enough job at dispelling the notion that bitcoin is tied to drugs.

The segment was neutral or minimally negative for publicity IMO.

For the same reason FB just bought WhatsApp for $19 bil.  A huge userbase (largest in the industry) complete with SSNs, bank account info etc.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:48:59
And this is one of the reasons that I truly think Gox will become the largest exchange once again.  They already have a huge userbase, and if A.A. came in and cleaned house, then stamped it with his seal of approval, I think the masses would flood back in - especially if it was incrementally better than any other exchange out there.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:34:01
Absolutely intentional.  People hear "BITCOIN, DRUGS" and are instantly intrigued.  They get roped in, Bloomberg gets views, and views generate money.  They have no intentions of actually reporting on anything or informing their viewers - which could be because they, themselves, don't know enough about bitcoin to know what information could be useful.

I absolutely agree.  Unfortunately we don't have a whole lot of legal ground on which to prosecute him because of bitcoin's currently unregulated state.  But with that said, I'd hope that any buyer would somehow tie any sort of compensation for Karpeles to the reparation of funds (hopefully he personally contributes this reparation).

As long as they're driving the speed limit and not driving dangerously/erratically then there's nothing to stop them and we're in the same exact situation that we're in right now.  If someone is legitimately trying to stop you from passing and driving dangerously to do so, then they run the risk of getting ticketed for reckless driving. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:28:37
Good point.  Gox users should hope and pray that they get acquired by a reputable company, because Gox owns a TON of personal information.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:21:00
On one hand, I agree with you.  Gox has undoubtedly delayed adoption and damaged the reputation of bitcoin, and for that, it should be regarded in the same light (if not worse) than Silk Road etc.
On the other hand, I think that Karpeles and his staff should be the ones that suffer.  If not legal/financial ramifications, Karpeles' actions need to have some serious negative consequences like community blacklisting.  It's also partially our fault as a community for not voting with our money somewhere else or somehow otherwise condemning Gox.  We've known for quite some time that they've had some sort of trouble (although we didn't force transparency, so we didn't know what kind and how bad the trouble was) and we didn't offer a fix.  I think there is some merit to the argument that Karpeles did an awesome thing by creating Mt. Gox, which proved to be the top exchange for the majority of bitcoin's life.  The problem is that what he built was not at all scale-able, and he was completely unfit to run an operation of the magnitude that Gox ended up being.  It's his fault that he never realized he had problems, it's his fault that he was grossly incompetent, and it's his fault that he didn't ask for help to fix his business.  
But one of the core tenants of bitcoin is the ability for anyone to innovate without permission.  Its incredibly rare for a company to scale correctly from it's very inception - they will all need help in some way, shape, or form along the way - Gox happens to need **a lot** of help.  I think being "bailed out" in this case doesn't totally apply.  Gox needs new management, new implementation of code, new security measures etc.  But what's wrong with a competent buyer that understands all of that coming in, cleaning house, and leveraging Gox's userbase and infrastructure to not only pay back all of the people that believe their fiat/btc are lost, but create the best, most secure, easiest to use exchange that we've ever seen, and ultimately further the bitcoin movement?

Absolutely.  He didn't do a bad job at all, I just think any member of the bitcoin community that gets an opportunity to talk about bitcoin in front of a large audience needs to be prepared to take the lead on talking about the benefits of bitcoin, instead of letting the anchor dictate the direction of the conversation with controversial talking points.

I'd like to see some of the nay-sayers sit down and try to make some of these points to an advocate like Andreas Antonopolous or an investor like Marc Andreessen - not because I want to put down JPM or squash any anti-bitcoin school of thought, but more because I'd love to hear their responses.  I think JPM raises some very valid points, but I also think they're discrediting the ability to innovate around and on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2014-02-26 16:54:06
Absolutely, me too.  What I've learned from this situation is that trust is everything in bitcoin, especially right now, while its in it's infancy.  There are certain industry leaders that have an established reputation for trust - particularly those that see bitcoin as much more than a currency - and these are the people I choose to follow.
What I've also learned is that transparency is essential in building a reputable bitcoin company.  Any company that refuses to disclose basic information to prove they are doing things "the right way" from a security/compliance/ethical standpoint is a company I refuse to do business with.
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:06:19
I agree.  Andreas was the reason I got into Bitcoin, but I don't think his radical, "fringe" activism is good for Bitcoin anymore.

She had a legitimate point that on a percentage basis, more drugs are bought with BTC.  It's an unfair comparison, but it doesn't make it untrue.  I think the point that should have been made is that it's irrelevant.  Instead of focusing on comparing specific examples between bitcoin to the USD (ie "Nobody is blowing lines with bitcoin") I think we should be focusing on what benefits of bitcoin made it the currency of choice for that specific application (purchasing things from unknown entities, regardless of their legal status) and talk about other potential applications.  The general public doesn't know what the possibilities are with bitcoin, but the sooner they do, the sooner they'll hop on board.

I believe a lager amount of drugs are bought with USD than with bitcoin.  I don't have a source to cite, but I think it's safe to say that this is a fact.
I also believe that the percentage of all bitcoin in circulation used to buy drugs is larger than the percentage of all USD in circulation used to buy drugs.  I didn't word it correctly in the original post.
It's just my personal intuition based on the market cap of bitcoin, and the fact that the Silk Road is still pulling in millions per month.  I'm not stating it as fact, nor have I done any math to prove it either way...

I haven't gotten any downvotes, so there are definitely people interested in the same things I'm looking for.
Hypothetically, there should be no barrier to entry from a user standpoint.  If I want to buy a $1000 computer on Tigerdirect today, I can buy $1000 worth of bitcoin and immediately exchange them for the computer.  I see that as more of a technological barrier to entry than a monetary barrier.
Can you elaborate on why we need to develop more powerful miners?  I was under the impression that if I wanted to mine 3 years ago, I was able to do it with a GPU, and that was driven by the mining power of the network.  Now, if I wanted to be a miner, I would need to buy powerful mining equipment to compete, because the mining power is much greater now.  Also, mining is something that we can't (and don't) expect every bitcoin user to do.  It's a specialized, voluntary, and optional participatory action of bitcoin adopters and therefore, I don't see it as a barrier to entry.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:31:45

@_date: 2014-02-26 19:21:36
I don't think "immediately" is going to happen.  I do, however, think that Mt. Gox actually still possess a majority of the frozen fiat/btc, and the rest will be reimbursed to users over time (hence the announcement that they will resume withdraws, but put limits on daily/weekly/monthly amounts).

I think the 1 mil bitcoin that Satoshi supposedly possesses are in a wallet that the owner(s) purposely lost the keys to.  
Forgive me if this is a naive question, but is there a way to prove to a group that you destroyed a private key without anyone ever seeing it?  Or if the key was seen by a group, is there a way to "lose it" and prove that none of the parties that knew about it saved it in any way? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:00:37
Agreed.  I saw an interesting strategy posted here on r/bitcoin where a user suggested incentivizing the "whales" to stay at Gox by offering to pay back their money proportionally through profit distribution until everyone's funds have been returned and Gox returns to a fully solvent state.  Also, if users wanted to cut ties and cash out completely, they could take a haircut and wash their hands clean...I think a rebuilding strategy like this, in combination with proven responsibility over a couple of years, could potentially absolve Gox of their tainted image. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:52:15

Great point.  Remember how negative the rhetoric about bitcoin was prior to the Mt. Gox collapse, especially from banks?  They were extremely dismissive and pessimistic, maybe because they had a smear campaign in place.  Once Gox collapsed and bitcoin didn't die, the banks started hiring consultants and putting job offers out for bitcoin experts.  Now the conversation is different and bitcoin/crypto adoption is "inevitable" according to banking officials.  I think some of the market manipulation is also done by banks.

Strong armed by a US government agent (or agency) using Karpeles, the CEO of the world's most prominent bitcoin exchange, and a then-prominent member of the bitcoin community, as a puppet to spread FUD and bring down Gox and bitcoin as a whole by making people think there is a flaw in the protocol....and it almost worked.
Agent: "You've been implicated in a money laundering investigation that could mean a lot of jail time unless you're compliant.  We're going to seize millions of dollars worth of assets as part of our investigation, and it will cause you to be insolvent, but you can't say anything because the investigation is still underway."
MK: "Uhh okay, so if I can't talk about the investigation, how do I tell my customers that we can't operate anymore?"
Agent: "You're going to tell them that there was a fatal flaw in the bitcoin protocol called tx malleability, or you're going to do a lot of jail time."

I don't necessarily see this as blatant evidence of extortion like everyone here seems to be implying.  It's entirely possible that Force was asking for a job at Mt. Gox to try to work on the case from the inside out, or to gather one or two more pieces of evidence before issuing the warrant.  This doesn't absolve Force of extortion or money laundering, but I'm not buying into these emails one way or another.  Am I missing something?

I agree that the ASICs are not "pivot-able".  Even though Coinbase has said they aren't interested in altcoins, I would argue that because of their infrastructure, team, knowledge and experience with bitcoin, they are better positioned to provide the same service for any other potential crypto than any other business in the world.  That's what I'm getting at.

I was more thinking less about the heat generation and profitability of mining, and more about enabling microtransactions.  
For example, I could potentially access 5 or 6 of my neighbors' wireless networks, but they're locked.  If I was visiting, or if I didn't want to pay for an internet service contract, these devices could enable me to pay my neighbor a small amount for the ability to use their network.  I get internet, and my neighbor gets some relief on their internet bill every month.

There are a couple of reasons that Silicon Valley "Moneybags" aren't buying up all the bitcoin (with the exception of Tim Draper, of course).  
1)  The moneybags you refer to are mostly venture capitalists, who, by virtue, are very "hands-on" investors.  These VCs like to maintain at least some form of control over their investments to influence the ROI.  By investing in bitcoin-based companies like Coinbase, they are able to provide advice, direction, capitol, or place key players in order to build a great team backing a technology they believe in.  By just buying bitcoin, they are at the mercy of the market.
2)  Silicon Valley investors want their investments to provide value.  Buying bitcoin with the intention of driving the price higher provides absolutely no value except to the speculators that cash out when the price rises.  Investing in companies that build the infrastructure for bitcoin will in turn provide value for bitcoin users and the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.
Timmy D's 30,000 btc buy was much more than a speculative buy based on his thought that the price would go up.  With 30,000 bitcoin, he can provide liquidity to many of the companies he has invested in that need it - like escrow services and exchanges.  The other, somewhat immeasurable purpose of publically buying all of those bitcoin is to make a statement that he believes in bitcoin.  He has now established himself as *the* bitcoin VC and top bitcoin companies will want to work with him because of it.
