Even the most hardcore libertarians would not like to legalize murder, so it comes down to if you view abortion as murder or not. I'm personally libertarian and for abortion because I think there's far too many people in this world as it is, many who are actually wanted and still dying due to starvation. I can see how someone can be libertarian and against abortion if they view it as murdering another human being.

I spent 7 btc ($70 at the time) on 3.5g of weed back in 2011. Twas some dank weed, came securely in an envelope that looked like business documents. As soon as I opened it I thought "dammnn this is the future", buying drugs off the dark web with digital coins was so damn cool. Back then I never believed people would see Bitcoin as anything more than a neat way to buy drugs untraceably.
