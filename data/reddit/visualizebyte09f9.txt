I wish he would make an attempt to understand.
I would definitely sit and answer any of his questions for a few hrs/days.
Maybe some of us need to understand Buffet more.  He probably is just stuck in his ways.

Saw an article somewhere.  The rich are not interested in making money.  They are interested in maintaining their purchasing power to keep up their lifestyle.

If someone sees nonsense and knows you have crypto that might be hidden.
They might know the 2048 words that would be in the pool.  It would be trivial to type the document and have it pull only the 12 words that match the list of 2048 words in the bip39 pool.
I don't have all the words memorized, but if I see words that are part of the pool I kind of know they are in the pool.  They are the most common words in the language though.

Just tried generating a new address. It started with 1.
Maybe I need a whole new seed?

Can I have your attention please
Will the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand up...
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all acting like you've never met a cryptographer before
Jaws on the floor like Craig and Roger just forked
And Hal Finney said, nothing you idiot. Hal Finney's dead.  Locked in a cryochamber.
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:02:41
I'M slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Nakamoto, all you other satoshis are just imitators
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:08:49
Either it's Hal Finney, cryopreserved
Or Alan Greenspan, not much time left.

Advisory - the following lyrics contain explicit language:
May I have your password please?
May I have your private keys?
Will the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..
Y'all act like you never seen a cryptographer before
Jaws all on the floor like craig and roger just forked 
And started whooping alts ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing coins over to coinbase (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no confirms, you're kidding,
He didn't just verify what I think he did, did he?"
And Hal Finney said... nothing, you idiots!
Hal Finney is dead, he's locked in my cryochamber! (Ha-ha!)
Crypto women love stacking sats
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
"Slim toshi, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his yubi key
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my miner loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' mempool
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for tone vayes to hump a dead bear
"My exaust fan is on your environment, my exhaust fan is on your environment"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little asic boost
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a block reward is
Of course they gonna know what sha256 is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the bitchute, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but traders.." Well, some of us fakers
Who fork other coins open like alpacas [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead coins and calculations
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't fork
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your private keys, sing the chorus and it goes
[Chorus - Eminem (repeat 2x):]
'Cause I'm Slim toshi, yes I'm the real toshi
All you other Slim toshii are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Toshi please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?
Luke jr don't gotta cuss in his posts to sell MBs;
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a nobel?
Half of you buttcoiners can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Toshi, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you feds could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Warren buffet?
Yo Shit, Bill Gates better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Craig Wright and Roger Ver
And hear 'em argue over who she gave coins to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on CoinTelegraph
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Satoshi ALS [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little bch and xrp groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
Who hash like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who hodl like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Public keys to joke about with your friends inside your livin boat
The only difference is I got the cores to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be orphaned or double spent at all
I just get on the terminal and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you icos out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these sats like vitaworms
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only coder in the nursing home flirting
Pinching private keys when I'm jacking in with thermal paste
And I'm jerking but this whole kw of overclockin isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Toshi lurking
He could be working at coinbase, spitting on your tracking tokens
[*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a kilohash!"
With his windows down and his miner up
So, will the real tosh please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each port up?
And be proud to be outta your fed and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus 4X]
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Toshi in all of us
Fuck it, let's all hodl on
