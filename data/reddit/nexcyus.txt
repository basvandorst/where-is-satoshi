You're in a sub about Bitcoin, generally we *like* Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:49:41
I want everyone on here to make money, and I want to get rid of any FUD, I also believe in Bitcoin as more than just an investment, I think the cyropcurrency technology will change the world 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:39:22

@_date: 2018-01-18 14:58:09
That's the best way to visualize it and hodl, with any investment, you're consenting to the risk that you're going to lose it all
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:47:58
the minute you buy it it's not your money anymore, I'm just saying buy as much as you can **afford** as soon as possible 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:54:14
I'm a college student, I own $250 dollars worth of Bitcoin, I don't care about the personal profits I care about the tech behind it all

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:44
Not true, I sold through coinbase at $19,027
I think it just lasted a few minutes lol 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:48:40
Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:51:05
Don’t scare it away
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:43:28
i imagine most people on this sub have $5k-$10k worth
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:29:19

@_date: 2019-06-28 04:38:31

no, just cried
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:31:02
I first bought at $4k and got lucky selling at $19k for a nice nice profit. Bought a little more at $15k and lost a little when it went down to $10k. I’ve always been watching the price but was technically “out”. I noticed this boom again and wanted to go in when we crossed the $10k mark, woke up and saw it was at $13300 and had major FOMO. Later that day, as we all know, 20% dip.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:30:19
Yes sensei
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:23:01
I just wanna say thanks to everyone in this comment section, I'm trying to win an argument with my middle aged father who thinks the government can one day decide to "shut down" Bitcoin

@_date: 2019-06-28 04:40:14
I will be sure to warn you all to sell before I buy
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:12:17
ALL HAIL THE BLOCKCHAIN
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:57:50

@_date: 2019-06-28 04:37:18
End result, sad Pepe’s in the subreddit
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:36:36

@_date: 2019-06-27 22:29:14
I walked out of a restaurant and decided to check it again after my meal, was very sad
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:40:17
big if true 
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:35:51
I had two when it was $250, but this was before there was any mainstream safe way to hold onto it and I was an idiot so I lost it, feels bad
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:17:31
I guess if all first world countries were to ban it within the span of a few weeks 
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:38:59
Thank you for everyone’s words and lessons, every comment is being read
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:21:27
Could they make it illegal for direct purchases? or super heavily tax places forcing them not to accept it 
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:37:54
It was more, I’m a college student so losing $200 in two days hurts me haha
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:05:46
you’re welcome frend
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:30:42
I was that idiot that did it
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:40:23
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:22:57
youve got a deal
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:32:22
well that wasn't that bad 
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:27:34
Can you post a sample
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:29:16
So even if it "pops" now, we hodl on for two years and a Bitcoin could be worth 100k. The point here is that its about the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:41:35
same, I'm really glad we have a mix of people here though so we can get different perspectives 
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:34:17
We will remember you when we reach the moon in our lambos
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:16:34
Thank you Mr Trump &lt;3
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:44:07
The ATH on Coinbase at least was $19k, ive never heard of it breaking 20
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:09

@_date: 2017-11-19 07:16:54
Thank you, trying to win an argument with an outsider

I bought the 15k rally about two months ago, feels bad man 
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:41:51
At least we made it to march 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:12:32
buying the dip I guess
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:01:51
I'll take those chances, I already consider all my money in Bitcoin gone, so it's not like I can go below zero 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:09:56
Sigh 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:36:31

Thanks so much, I'll check it out now 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:46:28
Let me tell you, if you read even one complete book about Bitcoin you know more about what you're doing than half of us 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:03:32
haha, scary truth is one day i feel like people will be saying that about us, wishing they got in at $6000
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:56:55
