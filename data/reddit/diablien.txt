The interface looks nice.

Thank you for posting this video!  This is great, I can share this with my partners and it will explain this much better than I can.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:02:32
Because it's Reddit and here, we share! ;-)

There are no chargebacks, yes that is definitely a benefit.   Just because there are no chargebacks doesn't mean there is no customer service though.  
In my company's experience, chargebacks are typically filed by uninformed or impatient customers.  We always go out of our way to make an order right with the customer, but there is sometimes a language barrier that causes a customer not to understand or work with us.  
We expect to still offer refunds in cases of lost shipment, because to us, it's still just USD.  An order made with Bitcoin wouldn't really be handled any differently than an order made in USD.  It someone pays in Euros via Paypal, we don't even bother to know that.
My assumption is Bitcoin would be the same.

You got it!!
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:55:45
I believe this to be true.  Would this stop you from purchasing as a customer?

Our credit card processing is handled by Braintree which negotiates our rates on all types of cards on a monthly basis and we have very competitive rates, well below 10%.  I'd be out of business with a 10% credit card fee.  We have a pretty high volume and are able to negotiate significant discounts.
As stated elsewhere in this discussion, Coinbase would cost us 0% for the million dollars worth of transactions.  Then it's only 1%

Well Coinbase is telling me it should only take "one to two days with a senior developer".
Our site is a custom platform built upon Django.  We have one developer in house and he is already working on some major projects.  We would have to delay some rather large projects that are expected to increase revenue to initiate implementing "Pay by Bitoin via Coinbase" as a purchase option.
I am not a developer by trade so it's hard for me to estimate the actual cost / time analysis without roping our dev in to spend time analyzing it.  In order to do that, we all have to agree to change course for a while.
If it takes a day, that would be great.  2 days, well...  a week?  Hard to justify.  I do not expect turing the Bitcoin button on to have the same impact to our bottom line as some of these other projects.  Ah the life of a business owner.

ahha maybe a better word would've been leery, yeas.  Thank you 16rjg4.
I am hoping that allowing Bitcoin would at least give us some sort of proverbial "pat on the back" from the super tech and Bitcoin community.  I'm not sure how helpful that will be to us, but I know we would be the first in our industry to allow this and that always motivates me.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:13:44
I'm not exactly sure of that.  It might actually be worse.
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:16:42
Simply paying by bitcoin isn't going to stop naughty customers from claiming their shipments didn't arrive, when in fact, they did.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:09:03
That is the company we are considering partnering with for this.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:03:55
While I would LOVE to rally the troops around that sentiment, I'm not sure accepting bitcoin is necessarily relatable to the end of Blockbuster.
They actually attempted to join the digital age (tried their own Netflix style service) and still failed.  I definitely wouldn't mind crushing the competition though! ;D

That would increase postage to be well over the value of the items inside, and customers don't like that.  People want stuff cheap, end of story.
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:58:35
This is what I'm talking about.  I can imagine putting some serious time into this, launching it, promoting it, and hearing nothing but crickets.
It would be time I could've dedicated elsewhere that actually brings in daily revenue.  I feel like Coinbase just wants to increase their pool of retailers.  Bitcoin will be a long hard game...
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:00:59
Thank you for chiming in.   I was hoping to hear from others, and it sounds like you have done exactly what we are considering.
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:40:50
I have to say that those percentages are completely wrong, in my case. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:17:46
I know what you meant.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:45:13
We accept credit cards outside of the USA only via Paypal.  We allowed other options, but you would not believe the kind of fraud that gets through!  
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:08:30
Wow I didn't know that companies can refuse to recognize chargebacks! haha  I guess if someone bought a ridiculous amount of stuff and charged us back we might investigate a little further and go through that paperwork.
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:54:47
It IS a great deal.  about 75% of our revenue comes in via Paypal. I'd love for that to arrive via Bitcoin sales!
