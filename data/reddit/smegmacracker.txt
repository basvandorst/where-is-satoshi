Haha. You won't get your coins back for another two weeks, OP. Welcome to the wonderful world of instant global currency bitcoin

Comments like these are negative and unproductive to the community. Perhaps you can educate this newbie on what could be done instead of being so condescending?

Comments like these that sweep the problems of bitcoin under the rug piss me off. It's all about the 'to the moon' mentality while dismissing and overlooking any pitfalls in the road. Lots of money had been lost, and the people who lost bitcoin here rightfully deserve their money back, or at least stay informed on the current events of Mtgox.

Neither will I when it reaches zero. Your point?

Why? This is a free market... Why are you wishing that he loses his ass?

I have the worst luck. I did use Bitfloor based on their easy UI. When they went down I had coins and fiat stuck too. Luckily I still had coins in my blockchain wallet. I then used mtgox thinking they were big and trustworthy. Sigh...

Thank you. I know many of us are trying to get rich, but it shouldn't be done through global panics and crises.

So North Korean nukes are a good thing?
