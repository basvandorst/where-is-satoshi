I'm also a shareholder. I've found a thread [here]( discussing the matter but I don't see any action. If there is something in the works, please DM me.

Records of your wire transfer to cavirtex seems to be the only option
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:34:11
Yes, that's how decentralization should work

Silly goose, that's a trick question! There was no price, because it was illegal to sell.  ^^/s

Thanks a lot for the recommendations. Much appreciated

Can you elaborate a little? Are there certain wallets/programs that are better supported for bitcoin scripting? Or is this something you have to do externally with a language like python?
For example,
There are 3 actors: 'A'  'B' 'C'
* 'A' wants to send 'C' some amount of bitcoins in exchange for a service
* 'B' acts as a mediator between 'A' &amp; 'C'
* B' is a bot that we want to create that has a reddit account.
* Person 'A' messages Bot 'B' how much bitcoins he wants to send user 'C'. 
* Bot 'B' sends user 'A' a QR code for the requested amount and the session identifier
* Bot 'B' notifies person 'C' that funds are in escrow, along with a message from Person 'A'
* Person 'A' messages Bot 'B' to release the funds
If we wanted to make something like Bot 'B', do you have any recommendations of resources to start looking at?

Its better that they shutdown and attempt to fix the problem, then perpetually have it up and broken. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:10:51
OKAY. You sold me
So how to do program with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:06:32
It could be falsified if someone acquired access to his reddit account and edited the message.
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:06:48
Where do you write the code for the bitcoin script?

I haven't heard of this activity fee and I'm using CAVIRTEX. How long is an account considered inactive? and how do we check if we have been fined?

What is NACK and BIP?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:36:46
Thanks for the informative reply :)
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:12:35
Is there a breakdown of the mining pools somewhere?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:30:43
BTC tx fees for miners

He said don't buy bitcoin because it will CRASSSH

What is the Chinese miner situation? I thought they lost their grip several years ago

No Freedom™ so far.

By DDOS, you mean, use as designed.

It is common, but 'naysayers' would be a more concise usage in this context. 
The association with racism is unfounded though.

1337 looks like leet which phonetically sounds like elite.

Your crunching numbers to increase the encryption of the coin your mining so that it can't be duplicated easily (aka the person duplicating the coin has to do more work than the mining that has already been done).
Thats my understanding of it anyways. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 01:28:33
Thanks, this probably is the best way
@_date: 2013-08-16 23:29:46
where did you buy this
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:24:57
whats a good site to get charts of these stocks?
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:20:25
No phone/rent/internet bill?

What timeframe is the graph?

1K will probably be broken within 24 hr, the flash sell didn't hurt confidence, there is no panic selling, the momentum is still upwards. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 00:17:16
Thats much better the cavirtex
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:25:33
It's OK, it'll bounce back if you take the long view.  
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:25:35
I see. It's definitely tough if you can't get a virtex account verified.
