Its literally why btc have value. People give it value. You can meme yourself into money. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:30:32
Lol. You can say that about anyone with a bankaccount. Its just that you dull americans are slow on innovation these days.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:43:14
I just find it amazing that no one care who he is we all just want to buy bitcoins.
For 9 years no one bothered to search for the dude? Not like "oh its a conspiracy" more like holy shit who is this person. I love a good mystery!
But if we think of the future, we will have a cashless society, we're slowly but surely moving towards it. Not saying BTC will be it but some form of it, for sure.
I havent had papermoney in years. In Sweden we have Swish which is a payment app in our phone which is locked to our bankID, I use it weekly. Send money, pay for items, instantly.
You can even pay your groceries with your phone, it takes 1 minute tops. Enter a phone number in the Swish app, amount of money, hit send, your bankID app pops up and you verify that its you with a code and its done.
So regardless of it being a conspiracy or not we're moving to a digital currency and with blockchain technology, I see no reason for it to be anything else.
Doesnt have to be a conspiracy its just our natural progression of technology, physical money will not be a thing in the far future.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:14:29
Ok elaborate how were in 1984 because money transactions through your phone. Bitcoin is literally 1984 aswell then btw. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:27:18
Didnt you see the insider news recently from some korea legeslator(spelling) type dude spreading false news in order to buy low?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:27:23
Only if you sell!
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:13:37
Which coins do you have?
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:42:11
Futures doesnt work like that. Wallstreet are making usd bets on what the price of btc will be at X date of a month and in return get usd back. Futures contracts have so far been at 9-11k and guess what. Everytime the contract is due the price of btc have been 9-11k.
Its high level manipulation and you can just put sell walls to hold btc price at a certain point, buy btc low and then let the price go free. When the price goes up and the next futures come they start selling, causing crashes and collect their futures bet at 9-11k. 
I think there 2/2 or 3/3 on 9-11k.
Its buy low sell high with a gamble on futures. Fuck these contracts.

The conspiracy is that NSA made BTC for a one world currency in order to control the masses and that our future is kinda planned out in stages.
In 1994 NSA did a paper on [cryptography of anonymous electronic cash]( 


Im a year or so into bitcoin and im stunned by how many people just accept that this Satoshi dude invented this out of good faith and no one knows who he is, thats fucken amazing.
But fuck it, true or not lets surf the wave and take advantage while we can. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:37:11
Futures are bad for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:35:07
So the conspiracy is correct. Btc/crypto will be the one world currency!
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:22:10
But if every other coin crashes, is the logical choice to turn to another crypto? It would probably be disbanded.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:36:59
Fuck the futures shit. Its wallstreet making bets with usd for usd whilst holding btc price hostage. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:07:41
Wish I sold at 20k. And i bought most at 8k.
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:23:59
Oh no youre retarded...
The bull run havent even begun yet, its likely to crash down to 7k to 5k to 2k to possible 800s.
If volume and support doesnt hold.
But unless this bankrupts you and you have to live on the street id say go for it, fuck money anyways.
All im saying is that youre a long long long way from making money from it lol
Have you studied anything or just listening to reddit/news?


Sounds like you know what youre doing :D Saw a dip on the 30 minute chart and insta panic lol
[Id wait for atleast 7.5k before entry but also it can take off who knows](
if youre holding for 12 years id suggest to not watch the price 24/7 if it goes to shit short term, will probably drive you mad.
Eventually crypto will probably hit where we all want it to go but the timescale is so slow man.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:15:31
Where is this dude now?
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:49:38
ok sry mortgage your house and abandon your plan to dollar average cost when you see the price drop and panic buy it all in one market order at the top after 2 weeks of fomo.
A bull run takes 1-2 years to develop. This is a small reverse-correction.
From the previous "golden cross" up to ATH took 900 days. Its been 50 days since the golden cross and it has potential to eat dirt.
90% we hit 7k


xDDD and mortgage your house. Solid investor there friend.

Ive been buying weed once a month with bitcoins for 2 years. Every time I went to buy I noticed the price was getting higher and higher but I never thought one step further to invest. 
I remember 500 usd prices. And I was living at my moms for maybe a year at that point and I wasted 80% of my paycheck on jack shit.
Its not as bad as alot of other people but shit, why didnt I find out about  this movement earlier? I just bought weed. 
Or why didnt I think ahead, probably because of the weed but yeah.

@_date: 2017-12-10 15:33:33
Yeah sure the news of it effects prices but at 18th and now 10th, trading is going to actually be viable, not just news. And if trading gets available that means more buyers.
After december the prices might skyrocket and then give it some time to get shortened and crash.
I think ill buy more today instead of waiting for a dip. 10th and 18th should just increase volume.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:59
Back at 12900!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:42
I bought like 6k at 12k and when it was at 19500 ish a few days ago I thought to myself to sell but it was a hassle with gdax and fees I couldnt bother.
Really wish Ive sold at the peak so i could rebuy now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:22:29
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:45:03
Hell yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:59:51
Well im taking a 4k usd loan to go balls deep but still keeping it safe. Its an easy sum to pay if it all goes to hell with my normal salary but im planning to hold for atleast 3-5 years before I start to worry.
Also its supply and demand right. Its a high demand for bitcoins and its only going to grow(look google trends) and theres a finite supply. High demand low supply = always interest, prices is not going to drop.
I put most of my last months salary at 9k and its 14, ive been looking at charts and forums/reddit for months and I dont see how it can fail, Japan and China are going hard on it and theyre the future, so hell yea.
News orgs are trying to cause panic and urge you not to buy which means theres a reason to buy, Rothschild are buying bitcoins, you can pay for bitcoins in the supermarket in Japan/China, its becoming more and more mainstream.
That dude who got donated is going to Joe Rogan Experience which have millions and millions of viewers per episode which means even more bitcoin hype. 
If the market resets, good I guess, ill just buy more bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:19:46
But if you want to trade BTC how do you avoid the insane amount of fees? You will only lose money every trade.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:19:18
1 million is jack shit dude. You must be in your teens/early 20s.

0.5$ tips instead of gold, remember seeing that. If the value was 0.5 back then im not sure. But yea, shit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:17:06
But why do I have to pay 100 usd fee on a 5k purchase? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:07:21
That is stupid. You could atleast speak up about why and let others form their own opinion. Now youre acting like bcash.

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:12:16
How do these people deal with fees?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:01
Id say the opposite. Tomorrow on monday and the 18th big markets are going to open up which will increase buys in bitcoins = higher price, then because the price have skyrocketed people will start selling and then a correction/crash will happen and the price is reset and off to the next record.
Why would the price drop?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:38
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:30:59
No, thats fluctuation relevant to buying/selling and causes a snowball/bandwagon effect. 
When ive heard people talking about a correction its gonna be around 2-5k. 
People compare it to the crash in 2013 were it dropped from around 1k to 200, thats a big price movement and in my opinion, a correction.
20% movement is jack in btc unless youre daytrading if you go at a day by day basis.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:55:13
Is that really a correction though? Feels too small to be a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:18
Thats what im thinking too.
The bubble/crash havent even begun yet, this is the first babysteps of bitcoins. Up until this point its been crawling on the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:00:42
On every exchange or just coinbase/gdax?

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:26:38
You lose if you sell. The future is bright but it will take years. Put money into your BTC account and come back once a year.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:47
I was so close to sell all my shit at 19800 but I couldnt be arsed dealing with fees and rebuying, paying fees again etc and I bought more at 13k and 11k.
Im so sad though I couldve made a 50% profit on 1 day. But the fucken fees and exchange delays are a bummer. Ill have to find a solid exchange, someone PM.
You live and learn though next time it hard peaks ill sell it and wait 2-3 days and rebuy, even if you rebuy at a small percentage loss(in a sense) id say the gamble is worth it. 
High peak, people sell, price goes low, people buy, price goes high. We're dealing with basic human psychology here not economics.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:18:57
What happened?

Wait atleast a couple of years. Short term the prices are going to be crazy high and crazy low but in the long run, hopefully, the value will go up regardless.

Wallets like that could be exchanges. When people say 80% of the bitcoin is owned by 20% of the people, alot of those wallets are exchanges. Who for sure carry 80% of the bitcoins most likely.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:46:32
And keep buying into the cult mentality from the other side.
Ive looked into both and I was wondering what all this hive mind shit was about with both btc/btch but honestly the shady shit btch have been involved it lately is mindboggling.
And you cant deny it. 
So far, all shady shit ive seen have been with BTCH, 100%.
Specially along with coinbase, which was a huge fiasco.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:45:14
You dont day trade btc really you buy on dips and hold on highs, then when it dips you buy some more. I dont think you can avoid the fees at this point? Would love to know how. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:19:30
Eventually it will break through because its in mainstream media hard right now, average joes are talking about it i.e more buyers(short term atleast) which will eat up the prices. Which is probably what the elite was betting on/if not orchestrating. 
What media doesnt want they shut up about it. Its deliberate that theyre talking about bitcoins for whatever reason.
I'd say because of the mainstream hype, we will see a huge price increase within 6 months then a solid crash/hard correction and like they say, what doesnt kill you make you stronger. BTC will still stand, like the internet did in its crash.
But its still sub 30k BTC volume which is odd.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:46:32

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:32:13
Realize in short terms the price will go up and down but in the long run it will most likely be a good thing. Also be happy to lose it all and look forward to it in a year. If youre fine with losing it you wont care about the price. If youre not daytrading theres no reason to keep track.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:51:24
Yes, ofcourse the government/elite wants bitcoin gone because it challenges their money but why will the price drop now?
Is it just doomsday people like Y2K and 2012? People were as sure back then as they are now with a crash.
If the government is scared I think that just makes btc stronger. Maybe a crash can be manipulated but that will only reset the market and make people buy more btc when its cheaper no?
hmm idk im new to this.
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:30:12

With fortunes, you can bet money on what the btc price is going to be, right? 
And if youre backed with enough bitcoins, cant you decide were the BTC price is going to be? 
With manipulating the buy and sell walls, its pretty dumb that you can freeze it if you have enough coins. You can essentially go +/- on selling/rebuying your bitcoins and get money on fortunes.
If ive understood it correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:34:12
So you mean more focus will be put on btc? Is Bitcoin gold an alt or whats that
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:51
When the price reaches 17250 you have to buy all the coins for the next sell order i.e lets say 17300. Yesterday the market price stood still at 17250 exact for several hours because we have to break that wall/buy all his coins before the price can move up to next sell order.
So youre automatically buying his coins, everyone is.

Gdax and coinbase are fraudulent, though.

Media are still against bitcoin so that means it will still increase. Id say it will grow for a couple of months then crash and reset. Only to grow further.
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:38:07
Also blockchain ultimately makes it easier to track and control money cause its not in a physical form.
If theres anything the government likes it is control(doesnt mean in a conspiracy way but.. yes) so if blockchain going mainstream then its going to be in the hands of the government.
And you think China is making decentralized exchanges/coins? HIghly doubt it.

tldr: dont explain that you borrowed to invest.
And why would you start jabbing when it was failing? Wait for it to double then say "hey look what I did with your money"
But also, youre dumb as hell to just randomly take a loan and randomly invest it, specially when we hit a new high mark meaning, it will go down again. If you did some reserach and waited a day or two, you couldve bought in at 11 or 12 and now sold it at 16 and made a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:33:10
Holy shit though! Saying AI needs blockchain technology because its system acts as a neuron of sharing information/money/value, remove the money from blockchain it basically acts as data transfer.
[Also heres Andreas M. talking about currency is only the first application with bitcoins.](
"Money is a language."
Pretty cool concept of sharing information, perhaps AI will use some form of blockchain technology.
But the fact that no one knows, who why or how blockchain technology itself got created. Why wouldnt people take credit?

When you sell a coin/stock/whatever the value of it decreases and if you buy it increases.
Supply and demand 101, high supply low demand=low prices cause theres more sellers than buyers=each seller want their trade to be bought so they have to put lower price than previous.
Low supply high demand means low amount of volume but high amount of demand which means ill buy it for a higher price cause I want it. 
Thats also why btc increases in price cause its a low/limited supply but demand increases=price increases.
So market movement is just the public value on &lt;insert thing here&gt;

Ok redditor for a day. Adoptation is less than 1% of the worlds population, crypto havent even begun yet.
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:44:58
Alts got over 1000%+ last year?
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:46:30
The leverage price got some weird calculation so its not the actual price youre doing margin trading on it moves slower i.e real price is 7400 but then a dip comes to 7340 and the leverage price on bitmex is maybe a minute after and is on 7380(to prevent manipulation they say) so its usually abit off relative to other exchanges.
You can go to bitmex and see their calculation but idk, it seems fishy.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:07:00
Fuck you crypto like its over, lol. It havent even begun yet.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:05:44

Volume keeps dropping because support level of marketcap is at 250k.
At 5th of april we were at 250k market cap(6.7k usd btc), may 5th we had a peak at 465k(10k btc) and now we're slowly going downwards to the support level of 250k we're we have touched a few times.
Its more than likely that it will return to 250k before going up again, in my opinion.

Yes but media was pumping BTC before that which is why all the normies got in.
Watching the news+actual reality last year was very interesting from the perspective of media influence on the public.
Also these news will collect dumb money and then watch it tank to 8k&gt;6k&gt;3k&gt;2k&gt;800(worst case scenario).
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:36:28
Buy at the top! Always good. Watch your btc be worth less than 70% in 3 months lol but after that ++++ gains so I guess its ok.
But next time do some research.

Yeah the IMF will just come in and save the central banks and continue to pump money into the system is my guess.
Or 2, everything goes ballistic but then we have a apocolypse on the horizon and basically the end of all(for some time)
or 3 we will have a goldbased backed blockchain currency provided by the imf/central government and voila, new world order, one world currency.

200-300k in 2025.
End of the year? Thats in 4 months lol. Around 3000-8000 range. 
Last ATH took 900 days of bull run after the golden cross, we are currently 50 days past the latest golden cross thus we're potentially several years away to build a bull run.
This is just a trap, watch it tank to 3k.

Weekly chart, fractal, parabolic, EMAs, channels, fibonacci, golden cross.
Can help you get an idea of the top.
You might not hit 300k but btc was around 15-20k for 7-8 weeks. So selling at 250k instead of 300k is ok.
You can easily see the top forming (in hindsight ofcourse)
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:28:57
China loves blockchain because all money is transparent and in their control lol
You can hide paper money but on a centralized blockchain with governmental approved coin youre fucked, your money will be in their hands.

Theyre going to create their own coin, have all citizens on it and thus control the money on all citizens.

To be honest, 19 years old, if you have a secure job(potential global recession starting within 2 years) id take a 3-5 year loan. Diversify small positions with gold/stocks/btc/alts and have 10-40% saved to buy low or emergency fund.
If you plan to hold 5-10 years then it doesnt matter I guess, keep buying!

"8 months after ath btc have won"
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:46:04
Bitcoin havent endured a bear market yet lol let alone a recession. (an economic one not btc)
Im bullish long term if the condition fits, but I dont think that the bull run is gonna start now at 10k like most people here lol.
I wont be surprised if we hit 3-5k again and even then worst case scenario is down at 700 lol
But after that sure im bullish.
@_date: 2019-08-22 06:51:19
Its likely to go and test 7-8k range and if that holds 200MA/golden cross on weekly then its high probability its true bull run.
Atm its not decided if bull or bears are in charge in my opinion.
It looks like a potential bull though but if 7-8k doesnt hold then its high probability we'll test 5k range 4k 3k and worst case scenario 800 range.
But google golden cross and how to set it up that should let you know where the trend is heading.
Im bullish but cautious.

@_date: 2019-10-24 11:13:09
First of all, zzzzz!!!
It took 3 years for a bull run to mature to 20k. We are STILL in a bear market from 20k, if you think this last pump to 13k was a "bull market" youre retarded and your opinion is invalid to begin with.
The "2017 rally will never happen again" was the third time it happened, lmao.
CRYPTO IS SLOW UNTIL ITS NOT. RIGHT NOW ITS SLOW.
We havent even begun the bull run yet, expect us to hit 5-3k again, chill for half a year then the progress can begin to the next one, meaning, we are POTENTIALLY 3-5 years from the next ATH.
A couple of months of pump from 5k to 13k is not bull market. Market is still short. 
Stop listening to your own opinions cause theyre dog.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:51:50
What are you even talking about? Do you have imaginary conversations in your head or what?
redditor for 4 weeks, did you buy btc a few months ago and lost 30% and now BTC is over?
Are you a teenager friend? Regardless, retard, we are 2-3 years away MINIMUM from reaching a new ATH, the bear market havent finished yet so I dont know why you have these shitty opinions about the demise of BTC.

Then you can rely on hashrate charts as an indicator for BTC price going up/down in the long term? Id assume. As long as hashrate is bullish then BTC is bull also? Not as a price indicator but volatility or trend I guess

Well, short term not bullish yet but long term yes.
Looking at BLX weekly and abcde patterns it looks more bullish than previously thought but im still not sure about the bottom yet.
I guess we'll find out if we hit a short term correction/bottom and then confirming a 1-3 year bull run.
Its very interesting times, global economic crisis on the horizon and the question will be if btc gonna go against it or follow suit.
If its a depression people will have to use their savings tho i.e not investing in crypto?

Tip for free, you can watch the price daily but only do it on 1 week chart or 1 day max. Dont sit on 1 hour or 15 minute everyday, its pointless.
Previous golden cross to ATH took 900 days, we are now 50 days past the last golden cross.
Its a long long long run.

yea but people aint goin to give you 1 dollar.

That is called FOMO, fear of missing out. And it manifested into your waking mind.
@_date: 2019-12-27 15:17:04
Wow almost as this was already implied!
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:43:49
Yes ofcourse.. 
I dont understand the need for having "1 bitcoin", the only thing my co-workers talk about regarding crypto "well youd want to have 1 bitcoin and not 0.02445" and I go, but why? Its irrelevant.
The number means nothing in itself. (other than the obvious value but you get my point)
You can own some btc, you dont need 1.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:10:46
Youre just butthurt and acting irrational and frustrated.
TLDR, theres nothing wrong with LB


You teenager lol
@_date: 2019-12-27 15:03:19
Because your eyesight is trash, use your mouse and draw a line from peak to price chart and it says 20k!
Also its a log scale
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:36:56
Why respond being a douche to begin with? "Bottom if true" was stated twice.
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:18:17
Bro, look at charts using 1 week instead of 1 hour.
A bull run is a 1-4 year cycle its not something that happens over night.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:37:47
that why your post have 3 upvotes andd 30 comments ;D
Just ~14,999,970million people left to get! Also they didnt even have to pay you in this post they only saw it.
But ya id bet that this will never happen.
You think there are 15 million people in the crypto space even?
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:50:25
Thanks you too!
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:52:42
Right back at ya.
You think it wont?

yep it is :D

You can hold it on their app which means if their company goes to shit(mtgox) you lose all your coins.
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:43:57
Who cares about new investors? Also new investors is not gonna seek out TA or even understand what "golden cross" means.
Youre just dumb.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:48:19
Its people doing 25-100x leverage, they will get killed in this choppy market. 1-5x MAX unless youre 100% confident that you hit the top.
But even then getting liquidated is newb shit just use stop loss and take the L. 
Hedge your bet with a personal butterfly setup
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:56:25
The fact that you dont even realize that youre talking about two different things are enough. OP is talking about pullbacks in a parabolic bull run.
Youre showing a bear market cycle(which also happens after each ATH, 70-90% correction)
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:54:51
It can and will happen an infinite amount of times
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:09:27
Whatever you say. Dont buy Into it then.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:43:46
Neither does the internet
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:51:35
This is what they say every time though. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:14:43
So how does the mempool get fixed/improved?

Who cares? If they believe its woo-woo money based on nothing but "trust" then let them.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:10:51
The amount of weak hands though
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:58:43
Yeah, people who dont understand crypto thinks you have to own 1 btc i.e dump several thousands into something you dont understand.
They dont understand we deal in satoshis but the numbers is confusing for most of them regardless.
So im not sure, maybe advertise it "Buy up to 1 BTC" or "you can own 10% of 1 btc"
No clue.
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:34:19
Well stay away from crypto then.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:53:09
Crypto is as real as anything else, stop it.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:56:38
We have had 2 bear and 1 bull(2 bull if you consider since genesis to first big ATH) so far, borderline at the start of second bull at the moment.
What charts are telling you that any lower than 7k would not be plausable? 
The weekly golden cross is too fresh to be a 100% indicator in my opinion so im paying attention to that as being bull or not.
I dont care about numbers really, its just a word used for measure and compare in this context.
I love charts and TA, please elaborate.
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:44:09
No I just dont care enough about this argument and theres zero reason for me to convince someone otherwise.
Crypto/blockchain doesnt have any value so dont put money in it, its ok.

Hey stupid

Just because youre too dumb to understand it doesnt mean it doesnt work.

But it does, lol.

Probably pay taxes on the 1 dollar but the thing with illegal activities you dont know how theyre gonna react.

@_date: 2018-11-19 21:05:25
What about the argument that it goes to X and miners wont mine or the 51% security is breached and people will attack btc and drive it even further?
Has that been a thing before aswell?

Why and how do you even think like that? :S I dont understand.

1 week is not enough to claim it as a support level. 5800 held for over a year but got dismantled without effort. 4500 and 3000 is not gonna matter.

Its a funny video, calm down kid. The convicted felon was probably good at motivational speaking as its portrayed here in a joking manner.
Its a goof.

@_date: 2018-03-07 17:44:34
No not yet lol. It takes alot of time for the battleship to turn in sea. The snowball effect have just begun, I would suggest to wait 2-5 days before buying in and the price settle at a bottom.
Also dollar cost average, dont buy 100% of your stack, buy each 10-20% dip.
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:34:25
Thats how they get you. Im certain you have bigger win % when you first start gambling cause they know you'll keep playing and when you lose it you invest your own money to win it back but keep losing.
Happens way too many times.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:14:27
Lol shut up you baby. It was not important but accurate because OPs context. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:31:02
History doesnt repeat itself but it rhymes.
How can you not see that its followng the same patterns as previous crashes?
Like what..
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:51:04
Being smart and emotional are two different things. I'd rather do business by logic than emotions which is the difference of dollar cost averaging and panic selling cause it starts to dip.
You should have zero emotional attachment to the money gains or losses and go by objective and logical reasoning.
You should still get in and out, try to catch the waves up and down, yes. But not by reacting emotionally, thats how you lose money.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:46:34
Not strong, at all. Thats like 1 month timespan without touching it, it just went from 3k to 20k so 3k is not really a support as its the rise from 1k to 20k. 3k was just a bump.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:19:29
700 bucks is alot lol.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:05:23
hello im your baby

Whales selling reaping profits. Went from 1k to 20k in 12 months. If people knew about the market everyone would sell. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:19:10
Learn trading. Expect the drops, it will forever go up and down. Dont get emotionally attached to numbers and gains. Think about it im terms of months and not days.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:17:24
Stop with these "leave its not for you". Teach him instead. In the beginning I was anxious about 500 drops but now, going from 20k to 5k barely raised my heartbeat.
Education reduces anxiety or emotional reaction. Btc is for everyone, its exciting and fun.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:41:33
Is it though?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:12:30
All media is doing is talking shit about btc.
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:18:33
5800 was a support level that it touched on several times during almost a year. 4k and 3k had their price levels for a few weeks not really a support level.
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:08:37
Thats what media does.
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:34:30
Well you were a douche about it. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:49:56
You literally applied your own prejudice to have that outcome. Its like youre prepared to be offended. Just move on.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:13:37
Thats probably automatic.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:39:28
Every invention have someone believing it will succeed. So you can apply this logic to everything.
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:03:55
Im pretty sure it does.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:50
Yes the past matters. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:13:52
Be careful with bragging or telling people about your btc. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:18:56
I always laughed at the argument against bitcoin "but bitcoin mining uses electricity" like what the fuck are you on about? How is that even an issue to begin with.
So thanks for this im going to save it for future use.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:37:49
Yeah and BTC have existed only during the biggest 10 year bull run in history and have never faced a recession let alone an economic meltdown.
So yeah..
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:06:54
Which bull run? The bear market havent even stopped yet
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:06:36

@_date: 2019-09-26 05:09:15
Fuck bakkt
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:58:28
Unless youre actively trading id say that everything is going to lose value in a recession.
Diversification wont help that much, id rather pull out and have cash ready to start buying when its cheap and buy put options.

This is not good guys.
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:10:23
The next recession will be cryptos first, how do you expect this power law to react?
Do you have any gut feelings on it? Or ultimately short term is irrelevant and it will bounce back to long term "goals"?
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:57:35
A futures market is introduce to suppress price. At 17k CME opened futures market all the way down to 3k, then they lifted it, why? Lol. Within months we went from 3k to 13k and now we have Bakkt, what is happening?
We're going down.
People have been saying for ages that gold price SHOULD be higher based on volume and volatility but the futures market is a hostage to it.
CME group even said themselves "We will tame bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:37:51
Moores law" prediction" is about double of what we currently have though. So we're not caught up to where moores law dictates we should be.
So it probably evens out in your example.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:38:28
Gold tanked in every recession, look at the charts baby
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:32:29
So when media hypes crypto prices go up. When they start spreading FUD, sell for the crash.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:31:16
Yes but the last 4 months we dropped from 500k marketcap down to 240k.
I love these non-story news articles.
Wonder if there are bots producing these.
When price goes up "omg btc price X in X days, record gains"
When price goes down "omg btc crashing the bubble have popped"
and rince and repeat whenever we get these 20% swings.
Just nonsense.
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:38:20
The /s was implied
@_date: 2019-09-05 12:39:53
Bull run takes 1-2 years to develop so dont fomo
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:34:39
Futures market is created to suppress price and volatility. Look what happened to gold when they introduced futures.
The CME guys said "we will tame bitcoin" when they introduced the futures at 15-20k and look where we are now. At 5k they lifted the futures market and backed out, and look where we are now.
And look what is going to happen in 7 days.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:24:50
Bakkt volume? The same thing that is happening now but bigger, dump. Futures market is dogshit for the average Joe.
@_date: 2019-09-04 12:35:36
100x margin trading
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:55:37
Lol, nice try.
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:22:48
Blockchain have won not Bitcoin. Which is an important difference.
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:40:21
The bakkt volume is what crashing the market
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:33:50
Thankfully that problem got a easy solution. Which makes your original statement of "BTC cant work as a long term solution" hella retarded.
@_date: 2019-09-10 06:48:46
How are they getting killed lmfao?
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:00:52
Put in a stop-limit buy at the current price, if it drops you check in tomorrow and purchase, if the price increase you already automatically buy at this price.
@_date: 2019-09-18 12:24:54
Yeah I guess, market dont care about the average person anyway so theyll get fucked
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:00:10
Hes joking. Thats why youre unemployed.
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:25:14
Less than 1% of the worlds population own BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:13:32
Yeah, everyone at my work when talking about crypto was saying "but its not fun to own 0.053939 btc I want 1" or they thought that you had to buy a entire bitcoin, not pieces of it.
Took me weeks to convince them that the number is irrelevant its the value it has. Or that they shouldnt care about it.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:25:27
/s or?
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:24:31
Your post is cringe. So dumb.
What are you talking about? If the people held for 5-7 years they wouldnt have lost their money.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:21:02
Well RIP everyones bank account information then
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:44:43
Yeah, just write a will and pass it over to your family/friends. As you do normally.
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:30:24
Youre exactly the same as the posts from 5-7 years ago, cant you see that?
Why will it fail and crash even harder when we get more and more adoption and legit companies(that survived the dotcom boom) investing and getting involved?
@_date: 2019-09-17 08:32:27
Get ready for the price to eat a fucken fat dick.
Futures market=suppress volatility=drive price down.
We're going down.
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:21:49
Original comment still stands but replace it "with a new job", then.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:35:59
You cant put that in a sealed letter or a bank-box to be opened when deceased then? Im sure this is the smallest issue regarding cryptocurrency and its future, youre just being nitpicky.
Also its not like its impossible to create a solution to this if it doesnt exist yet, like a custom crypto-will. Necessity is the mother of invention.

@_date: 2018-04-05 07:06:56
No, I dont care enough to argue with someone who spends time in a sub just to argue. Literally could give a shit about this issue. Ok so were gonna lose some coins here and there but thats only going to increase the value of existing coins. And thats fine by me.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:25:56
Well considering less than 1% of the worlds population owns btc and were at a 0.3 trillion cap vs internets ath of 10 trillion. Id say were still pretty early!
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:36:05

Buying at the top, FOMO is working as intended!
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:11:59
People kidnap people for BTC yeah. So you should never tell anyone what youre holding or how much.
The real risk vs fake internet karma? Who cares
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:55:51
That routine sounds like a good thing though lol. Everyone should be doing that fundamentally.
Minus the formation and go to job 365 days a year thats probably tough. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:02:14
This is how everyone reacts when BTC starts moving lol. We're not in a bear market yet so be cautious of that.
Personally taking a small sum loan is worth it, like who cares, so you have to pay 200 bucks for 2 years or something id say its worth it if you have a decent income already.
If you have 7k id buy 70% btc and 30% alts. Purchase a few hundred bucks a week or something since price is not certain.
If you buy 7k of btc today and in 4 months it tanks to 2k youre gonna kill yourself so spread the purchasing in and plan to hold until 2025 ish.
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:55:21
Looks like a good way to get some order in your life.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:15:15
Ugh get the fuck out with these stupid bot posts.
