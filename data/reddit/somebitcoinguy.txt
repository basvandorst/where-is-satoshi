This is like a blatantly obvious pump attempt here on your affiliated businesses.
And for the record, the answer is drugs, crime, and speculation.

You're nuttier than squirrel shit if you think someone hasn't filed a damn report.

BitGo needs to release the public address of each address they control. I'm curious if they even own all the Bitcoin they're claiming to.

Ransomware Industry is a $100 Billion (LOL) dollar industry?
You're kidding right? Who the hell came up with these numbers?
I mean if a ransomware group makes out with $17,000 USD in a hit then it makes headlines everywhere. 
So this guy is saying that the ransomware industry is netting $273,972,602 on average every day?
I wish, we'd all be filthy rich, price of Bitcoin would be out of the roof.
This is a shit article that is just meant to pump Chainanalysis and their shitty product.
It's not science boys, you just treat all inputs with different addresses that are used in a single transaction to be "one wallet". You then just keep doing this and you form clusters. You're not a pioneer or a super uber entrepreneur for pulling down blockchain.info's public API and running a loop on the json data. WalletExplorer.com does this shit for free already.

Did you make sure that it wasn't simply a change address where the 10 BTC was being sent?
Which wallet do you use? (IE: Electrum, Mycelium, etc)
Quick example of the way Bitcoin works and how amounts coming and going are handled: If you received 10 BTC in a single transaction, it would be called an unspent input within your wallet. Let's assume your wallet was empty and this 10 BTC single transaction was the only one. Now you wish to spend some Bitcoin out of your wallet. We want to send 3 BTC to 1xyz and we send it. Now if you look on the Blockchain you will likely see your wallet receiving 10 BTC and then a transaction where it looks like 10 BTC is spent, but actually 3 BTC is going to your destination: 1xyz, and the other 7 BTC will be going to a different address, which should be your change wallet.
This may be the case here.

They can't.
The weak point of Bitcoin is cashing out at exchanges. They rat you out voluntarily, doesn't even take a subpoena. The poor chaps at the exchanges are in such a shitty legal limbo that they will jerk Uncle Sam off and give away your privacy proactively!
If you want to use a centralized exchange, check out PayPal. Way smarter than using Bitfinex or the likes.
If you want to trade Bitcoin like a man, do it peer-2-peer. A currency by the people, for the people, and should always be traded among the people. Letting the same cronies that built Wall St. handle our wallets is a mistake.

Fuck the police™
We already know how the fuzz works in investigations like this, they steal the rest of the money.

Sounds like companies need to start teaching their employees to heed the damn messages that say WARNING: DO NOT OPEN. You have to click like 3-4 before a malicious attachment even takes over nowadays.
How about the network administrators stop giving unrestrictive rights to it's users that allow modifications to the operating system and the ability to run shady programs. Create a strict sandbox policy for any damn thing you click.

Excellent observation.

Wow, it's amazing that all of this information and the CEOs past has been quiet.
You can simply read this guys past posts and tell he his a shit bag.

Truth. Someone would deal you in for half that via LBC, locally I'm sure.

They don't really hold an exchange rate risk. They just purchase the Bitcoin via API from an exchange when you stick the money in. Also can use futures markets to hedge your risk if you are holding Bitcoin.
