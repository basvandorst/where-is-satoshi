Makes no difference to purchasing, keep it separate so you only have to trust yourself ;) you can all buy an amount of Bitcoin separately :)

Priority is essentially given to those who provide the highest transaction fees. Miners need to make money after all.
The way coins are generated is via a special transaction added at the start of the block which basically states "I get 12.5 bitcoin". Obviously if the miner then gets the block solution to that block before anyone else gets a solution to their block (with their own "I get 12.5 bitcoin" transaction on it) then the miner gets their block added to the chain and hence gets the reward :)

Costs a bitcoin transaction fee, these can be a little volatile so be sure to check before you hit send. Transfer can take up to an hour or more depending upon network congestion. Yes, you have to transfer back to exchange to sell. No idea about IOTA

Had the S, now have a Trezor :) never tried the original Ledger... Wouldn't go buying second hand...

Never heard of keepkey, personally have owned both a ledger and a trezor. Both are very good and either will do the job ;) pick whichever you can get cheapest :)

I remember literally hovering over the buy button when it was $0.17 per BTC... was going to buy $320 worth but I was a student and couldn't really afford it at the time... Wish I had...
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:12:07
Honestly can't remember... was quite a while back.

320 was an approx exchange from GBP to USD back then (1.6x rate) of £200...
I was being honest with myself, was massively in student debt and it would have been going on my overdraft, didn't actually have that money to begin with.

Yep... outright painfull...
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:49:03
Same, wish I'd managed to mine a few before it became ridiculous...
