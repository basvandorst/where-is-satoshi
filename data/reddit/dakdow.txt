Well, you’ll have the chance to buy bitcoin for $100k if you pay a small fee. Your profit is anything above that. Or you could sell the option to someone else and receive that premium. Their fee. Which will grow higher as price moves higher. So profit-unlimited and unknown.

50% back to 100% of recent move from 18k to 3k.

We passed the 50% line. Now headed for the final reversal in the $13s. If it breaks above, it’s on like donkey Kong. If it falls, it’ll be bloodier than a shark attack

I would think that robinhood would be a good holder of those coins for you. they don’t have a wallet address. But are backed by the fdic.

At that price, bitcoin is worth much more than anything else in the world. Berkshire is work about $500B at that price. Too many ppl look at share price and not marketcap. Share price is only a number. Means absolutely nothing to real investors.

Just think about what you’ll be able to do with 400,500,10,000% more than what you have now?
