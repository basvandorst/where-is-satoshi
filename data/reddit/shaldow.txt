I was worried about the server before making the probe transfer, but there are so many sound explanations for that, it could be payed in advance with good discount or renewed on regular basis with dozens of other domains and hosts.
I did watch back the transactions and failed to find any pattern of inputs and outputs. To tell the truth I am not a bitcoin guru...  People here think it would be enough to exchange to monero and cash out to disguise the track.

I have to agree with you it is rather unethical, but I think otherwise it might just have become one more lost wallet. And I am worried about this being illegal. By the way are you sure you would just walk away in my place? If you say "yes", I've got a story for you:

He is not my friend. We were neighbors and had random chat at the elevator from time to time. I think the chances of him reading the same sub on reddit are super small and anyway he didn’t seem to be the owner of the wallet.

I don't know if you were right about the screenshot and I have given away something. Deleted it for good, thanks.

Well, I am not exactly the wallet owner. I didn’t find anywhere the password or the private key. The direct url leads to the page in Japanese %-) I have hidden the url for obvious reasons. It pretends to be a simplified engine of the classic Ponzi scheme. I know one should not trust these as they are usually a scam, and even if not, the system could be offline anyway due to the wallet upgrade or domain expire. But what if not? Would you risk 0.001 btc + transaction fee in my place? Luckily I did, and the money bounced back to me, just the same amount. That meant the engine was still up and running and there was money on the wallet at least to pay the transaction fee for sending my money back. The next step was to send 0.01 btc as it was the first amount promised to return with interest after 7 days. Surprisingly it worked too, as well as 2 transactions at one time. I started drying the wallet increasing the amount and the number of operations little by little and getting it back with interest until I reached 0.1 btc transfer. This one never came back, but all of the smaller transfers returned shortly after as usual. I think there is some limit or bug. A week ago I loaded 0.05-0.09 and they got back to me resulting in almost 0.3 btc overall profit. Then I realized that I can dry this wallet empty over time and started worrying about how legal it is.

Yeah, yeah, over 5 years have passed and noone cared. If they could take the control they would have done that a while ago. I am positive it's just one more lost wallet.

The payments were effected from different addresses. I couldn't find anything interesting about that on blockcypher, the input consumed was exactly, or just a little bit more than promised to pay off.

It generates different addresses.

I had a neighbor who was a web programmer. Two month ago he was moving from town and offered his desktop for sale. He missed some personal data to remove. I didn’t find anything interesting there, except for the folder “pirate40”. It looks like he was working on some project for crypto investments in asia region. As far as I understood, it was a classic Ponzi scheme on bitcoin for the Asian market. The message on the main page states that the project was closed, but the direct url leads to the page that works. I think that the customer was pirate40 or someone from his company (you can google who it is), and the project was not finished due to the bankruptcy of his trust and following arrest. I am afraid that the wallet affiliated with that company should have been forfeited too. Is it safe to withdraw from it?

I'm investing and getting it back, isn't that what the project was about in the first place? I don't feel like I am doing totally bad thing it's much more like being Kaiji who found the way to win the cheater.

Сan you recommend a reliable exchange btc-monero and monero-cash without kyc?

I don’t think scamming the Asians was the goal. The man had already made a big business, I think he wanted to expand to the new market and the engine was operating only the low return for the testing purpose. Anyway it doesn’t matter now. I hope he left a good amount on that wallet, bitcoin was very cheap back in 2012 and he could easily afford 100 or even 1000 just for the technical purpose.

Of course I will not show the url. I am sure I can handle it without your help :-)
