Sorry for butting in here (huehue!), but I agree with OP when he says that banning the worst trolls would be more effective. Not necessarily because it is hard to create a new account, but because I feel that a lot of them are fairly narcissistic and they give a great deal about what their buttbuddies think of their trolling. Having to create new accounts all the time reduces that aspect and therefore might also reduce the motivation of some of them.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:52:26
No, I really don't see what you did there. This is pointless. Let's agree to disagree.
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:09:23
Bitcoin integration confirmed!
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:47:13
Mining is basically just guessing a lucky number (the "nonce"), which in combination with the block headers produces a hash with a certain number of leading zeros. The number of leading zeros that are required to "win" (aka solve the block) is defined by the difficulty. And the network adjusts the difficulty in set intervals so that the average block time is close to 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:43:47
Haha yeah, at least of some of their older songs.

And why does it matter what their motivation is? The result is the same regardless of whether they are paid shills or just mentally disturbed assholes. And that result is that every thread on deteriorates into the same stinky soup of troll shit that nobody really wants to be a part of.

No. The prediction model is constantly adjusting based on the entirety of the price movement. So every time it makes a prediction, it uses new assumptions for the underlying model in order to optimize the "accuracy" when backtesting the model over all available data. That means that the "predictions" are only good when making predictions that lie in the past. Whether they are also accurate for future price movements is not included in those accuracy values at all.

Opportunity cost:
Let's assume someone has 1 bitcoin in a BCI wallet. They assess the risk of loss due to a problem with BCI to be not more than 1%. That would mean that if the ~~opportunity~~ cost of moving it to a different wallet is &gt; 0.01 bitcoins ($3.50), then it's simply not worth the trouble.

Nobody is forcing you to take part in these discussions. You can savely ignore the thread you linked to and go to the next one which is hopefully more interesting to you.
And none of this is even remotely an excuse for the horde of trolls who think it's ok to ridicule everything and anyone in here, all the time, repeating the same stupid crap over and over and literally shitting on anything that people are excited about with bitcoin. It's pathetic, it's disgusting, and it should not be tolerated. After all, you said it yourself

What exactly are you trying to do?
Like I said, bitcoin addresses are very similar to email addresses in that regard, but instead of an email you send bitcoins. So if you want to send bitcoins to someone, you have to know their bitcoin address before you can do so, just like you would have to know their email address.

I'm pretty sure I didn't understand your idea. But the blockchain being a chain of blocks is what enables a trust free transaction ledger which is secured by proof of work in the first place. I don't see how you can remove the chain aspect from the blockchain and still retain both trustlessness and security.

Whether you prefer mining in a pool or on your own mostly depends on your personal preference for more or less variance in your payouts. I would say the less hashpower you have, the more attractive does mining in a pool become, because otherwise you're basically buying a lottery ticket every 10 minutes with your electricity.

Yes. You could get really lucky and find a block right after you turn on your CPU miner. It's just very very very very very very unlikely.
And if someone says it takes x amount of time to find a block with a certain hashrate, then they probably mean on average.

How are the trolls a result of people being optimistic about bitcoin in What is wrong with being optimisic about bitcoin in There are a lot of subreddits where people are extremely enthusiastic about the thing they like to discuss, without them being overrun by trolls. Stop looking for excuses for the disgusting behaviour some of these assholes are displaying in here.
And the reason it's near impossible to have a decent discussion in here recently is exactly because of all these trolls and their ruthless derailing of every thread.

He is by far the best qualified concern troll in Bitcoin :)
But seriously, he has made various contributions to the bitcoin code and knows what he is talking about and usually has very valid points, but he also seems to be a bit of a drama queen.

And the most trolls.
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:09:02
We were all instantly able to send him money, and he was instantly able to send me money after I simply posted an address that I made up on the spot. There was absolutely no risk involved for anyone while doing this, neither a financial risk nor a privacy risk. There was also no risk of a third party freezing our accounts because what we were doing looked suspicious to them.
But of course you know all that and you're just a stupid troll.

The main problem with that advice is that a lot of these troubled personalities are deliberately spreading disinformation by misrepresenting facts or even repeating outright lies. If nobody contests them for doing that, then it can be very hard for newbies and less knowledgable bitcoiners to distinguish between what is true and what is not true. The only way to effectively deal with this kind of behaviour is by removing troll postings and banning repeat offenders. 
As I have already written in another posting: There is a difference between constructive criticism and constantly misrepresenting facts. And there is also a difference between being a skeptic and constantly spreading negativity for the sake of spreading negativity. 
The difficult part is recognizing that difference. But that's what we have a team of competent mods for, right? :)

Bitcoin core is not a deterministic wallet and therefore there is no seed. The wallet.dat backup only contains actual privat keys that were randomly generated.
But the bitcoin core client uses a feature called [key pool]( that generates a number of keys in advance before you use them (100 by default). So you would have to update your backup after using 100 new addresses (including change addresses).
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:59:14
You can sigh all you want. You said we should talk about the investment aspect less and "focus more on the day to day utility", because you "think that this is more defensible"! What. The. Fucking. Fuck!
I'm usually not even using exclamation marks a lot, but you are seriously pissing me off right now! And not because of what you write, but because you are a mod writing this! So please forgive my sligtly agitated tone.


Yes. And a just as valid use case is to only treat it as an investment and nothing else! Just because some people are investing in this technology, while they leave the part of improving the ecosystem to others, doesn't mean that the argument that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme suddenly somehow becomes a "warranted criticism". Not in the slightest! 
Speculation is an important aspect of Bitcoin, especially in the early stage when liquidity from utility driven demand is low. Bitcoin NEEDS speculation and investors! Stop chastizing them! And stop trying to appease the trolls!
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:32:13
Oh, ok. Because some people on the internet say HODL we now don't make distinctions between different things anymore. Ok, Frankeh, whatever you say.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:38:46
Those are two completely different arguments!!
First you say 


Which is basically saying we have to stop talking about the investment aspect of Bitcoin (which is real, important, and perfectly legitimate!) because some "critics" (aka annoying bunch of trolls) keep repeating their bullshit about how this is all ponzi scheme for early adopters. And you say that as a mod of this subreddit too!
And now you say


Which is completely unrelated to the above. Are you so brainwashed by the troll brigade already that you don't even realize what you're saying anymore?

@_date: 2014-12-10 17:52:31
It's a good analogy, but it's not perfect: For someone to be considered rich for owning one bitcoin, Bitcoin would have to become an integral part of the world economy. That means that a lot of people will need bitcoin for their daily lives, and are therefore directly affected by its availability. The only people who will ever "need" an 1940s Aston Martin are rich old guys having a midlife crisis :P

If an investement is safe, then there's no potential returns on that investment. Unless you invest based on insider information, which unfortunately people in here won't share with you.
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:22:19
The answer is: We don't.
Either Bitcoin becomes attractive as an investment again, or it's not going anywhere. Bitcoin's utility is nowhere near a level where it can support an ecosystem based on utility driven demand alone.

I don't think the throwaways submitting a few troll threads now and then are the real problem here: The motives behind most of these submissions are painfully obvious, and the fact that they get submitted by a new account makes them even easier to identify. Usually when I report these kinds of threads they get removed quite quickly too.
The real problem is the constant fucking trolling by the few dedicated assholes in here who are actively misrepresenting and twisting facts to deceive the readers, attacking and ridiculing everyone with a positive opinion of Bitcoin, and by doing so are deliberately creating a negative and hostile environment. They are highly detrimental to a civil and healthy discussion, and they also confuse casual readers and newbies who can not discern trolling from legitimate concerns as easily as the more knowledgable bitcoiners, effectively alienating them and turning them away.
But apparently the mods in here are a bunch of pussies who would rather watch this place go to shits than get off their moral high horse and do something about it. Whatever.

Of course that's a real issue with HD wallets, but I don't understand how the ECDSA attack you linked to plays a role here?

It's not just a dream, but it's not yet a reality either. So yeah, a flourishing bitcoin ecosystem is obviously the long term goal, but as of now, most spending comes from people who invested in Bitcoin and are also using it as a payment option. And this will not change over night. It will be a gradual transition from a speculation/investment driven economy to a utility driven ecosystem. But every little step in that direction is important, no matter how marginal it may seem.


Why always the negative connotation when talking about investement/speculation with Bitcoin? Speculative investment is part of our world, and it is a necessary part too, because without it, new technologies, ideas and businesses would not be viable. Bitcoin needs investors and speculators to provide liquidity and bootstrap the bitcoin ecosystem you apparently like to dream about. Investors enable others to make stuff happen, instead of just dreaming.

Yes, arguing with trolls can be fun, there's no doubt about that. It can also be very satisfying to make them look like fools, which in the case of the usual suspects of this sub really isn't too hard most of the times.
BUT! Regardless of whether some people like to engage the trolls in pointless banter or ferocious battles for being right on the internet, it still is detrimental to a healthy and civil discussion in this subreddit!
at least in my opinion, is not supposed be about defeating troll after troll, in every thread, every day, with the same old stupid bullshit over and over again. This sub is supposed to be about engaging in interesting discussion about Bitcoin the technology, the currency, and the developments surrounding it. It is also supposed to be an easy entry point into the world of Bitcoin for newbies and people who are interested in learning what this is all about. And the trolls, as easy to outsmart as they may be, are still creating a very hostile and toxic atmosphere (I know this has been said a hundred times already in the past days, but it's still true).
Tl;dr: This is and not @_date: 2014-12-15 00:25:16

That is true. But the huge advantage government issued money has over Bitcoin is the perception of trustworthiness. It might be a complete illusion, but it's still trust that people place in their government for guaranteeing that their money will still be worth tomorrow what it was today. They have faith in their government to be competent enough to use their power over the monetary supply to everyone's advantage, and they have faith in the people who are in control to not abuse that power.
Bitcoin doesn't have that kind of trust. In fact, it has the exact opposite: A lot of mistrust, suspicion and confusion about how it should have any value in the first place, let alone why it should have the same value tomorrow. That's why people won't just wake up one day and accept the fact that Bitcoin is in fact better money because it actually requires less trust and less faith than its alternative. This kind of realization has to be earned, and Bitcoin has to constantly prove its trustworthiness while being under constant scrutiny from an abundance of very outspoken critics. And that's why the current bear market is, in my opinion, extremeley detrimental to Bitcoin's adoption as trustworthy money: The declining price seemingly validates people's suspicions and reinforces their disbelief that this could ever work. 
Sure, the situation in Russia once again is showing the world that governments can't really guarntee that their money will retain its value in a crisis situation or during an economic downturn. But right now, Bitcoin does not look like an alternative because it couldn't retain its value either. All the VC money pouring into the Bitcoin ecosystem, all the big name merchants accepting bitcoin payments, all the prominent media figures praising Bitcoin for its potential... all worth nothing in the eye of the public because the only thing they see is the fact that they can not trust in Bitcoin as valuable money. Sad but true.

@_date: 2014-12-10 18:02:26
Nobody needs to extract value from anyone. This isn't an orange juice factory. The value is defined by supply and demand. And demand is a result of speculative interest and utility. So if the value goes up, that means that demand has gone up in relation to supply, either due to speculative expectation, or due to increased utility. 
So to answer OP's question: The money is coming from other people who are willing to speculate on its future value and from people who want to use it for its utility. The speculative aspect will be the main part in the beginning while utility is low, and it will only be a small factor once adoption has reached a point where utility is the prevalent motivation for demand.

rydan is not "this subreddit", he's just a buttcoin troll, like half of the other posters in this thread.

Something something no matter how much you pay for a ticket, a full bus is still a full bus.

The universe wants one money. If Bitcoin can't be that money, then something else will. The distinction between currency and gold is a thing of the past, the winner of this paradigm shift will most definitely be both.

Theymos is an expert in creative accounting and convincing himself that he is doing the right thing, so he knows what he is talking about.

That bullshit argument again. The block reward is what incentivizes miners to secure the network for now, and that's by design: it's called the bootstrapping phase, and we're still in the middle of it!

What if some jerk keeps rebroadcasting it? I couldn't do anything about that, right?
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:25:24
Yeah, I figured it out while you were typing. Thanks again.

The thing is that they don't care if they don't understand what they're talking about and they don't care if they are misrepresenting facts, the only thing they care about is painting a negative picture of bitcoin no matter what.

That's not a problem, I would create the transaction myself and sign it on an offline system. I usually know what I'm doing, I'm just unsure how no fee transactions might get handled now that the rules of the network have changed a bit.

Hey let's fix fundamental scaling issues with a pretty UI! Users are stupid anyway, right?

It's okay, no problemo signorino. But what [if I hold a gun to your head, tell you to take out your penis, and let me in on your little circlejerk]( Would that work? I'm totally serial too!

You must be talking about a different blockchain.

Let's hope they don't spam our precious little blockchain with economically insignificant purchases or something.

Even if you think that 1MB is "just fine", it's definitely not helping Bitcoin to gain any trust in the eye of the public.

It's really simple:
Your odds of finding the next block are (your_hashrate) / (total_network_hashrate).
So yes, even the slowest miner can get lucky and find a block. And since it costs the miner money to try, it is kind of like a lottery.
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:49:14


That's what I'm still unsure about.
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:40:52
How did they explain it?
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:57:09


Exactly. And Bitstamp shouldn't get involved in this.
