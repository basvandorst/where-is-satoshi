And you wont 'success' at life with your terrible grammar.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:38:42
Keep dreaming dummy.
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:36:44
You are dumb beyond words if you don't think Bitcoin has any value.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:40:14
I believe (and I could be wrong about this) that miners will still receive rewards from transaction fees, and that in theory, when all coins have been mined, the network will be very large and there will be enough transactions to still support miners (or at least some of them).

Someone ban this turd.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:06
The mempool right now is absolutey rammed, more full than it's ever been:
Two weeks ago I sent some big transactions (lots of inputs and outputs) for less than a dollar and got confirmed within hours. Yesterday i sent similar transactions with fees of $50 and still waiting for a confirmation.
Sit and wait, and hope that the mempool will clear up and this isn't the beginning of regular congestion that bitcoin cannot handle, because that will be very bad news for all of us.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:49:20
Fees are becoming ridiculous and show no signs of getting any better. This could be bitcoins downfall ultimately, time will tell.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:41:40
Drops are healthy, i'm glad this is happening to be honest. People need to relax, you're crazy if you think this level of growth if sustainable. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:09:22
Nice site, very original! I'm one of the owners of [Bitcoinreward]( and would be happy to drop a link to your site from ours.
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:09:44
You are dumb beyond words.
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:51:35
I don't think you understand the meaning of the word xenophobe. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:50:25
Nice trolling dickwad.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:00:51
Thanks for the reply, I'm actually using Electrum, I didn't realise that different wallets had different fees!
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:20:31
Yup, i had a 15 sat/byte transaction stuck for around 6days. Now I can send with 10sat/byte or even less and they are going through within an hour or so. It was definitely a spam attack before.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:00:22
Try a few days with no confirmations...
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:14:12
Hmm sorry do you mean import into another wallet software? Or do you mean import my existing wallet into a new wallet of the same software?
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:52:44
Yeah i'm not in any major rush I suppose, out of interest, how come it will be cheaper in a couple of days?
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:13:50
That's not the point moron. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:37:34
Yup, but a low enough fee and your transaction will stay as 'unconfirmed' for a long time. Just like mine is, still waiting after 72 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:39:32
I truly hope that in time this situation is corrected. I tried moving 0.4 to a new wallet, that balance was comprised of around 60 transactions over the last few years. The fees were absolutely ridiculous, so i manually set a much lower fee and now after 3 days i'm still waiting for a confirmation.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:17:47
Go eat a dick.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:06:56
Sending funds from one wallet to a new wallet
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:38:19
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:03:30
Give  a try, i've used it before on a bitcoin related site of mine (
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:22:17
Used Bitcoinreward before. They're legit and have been going for years, been paid many times by them!
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:56:48
20 million? Sure @_date: 2019-06-15 07:39:14
Nah, you give people way too much credit. Look what happened during the Facebook privacy scam, did most people jump ship and leave? Nope, not at all. Most people will do whatever Facebook tells them to do.
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:44:58
Sounds like you have mental problems.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:53
Thanks for the replies everyone, the transaction ID is 5c285dcb84b1a665a66dfdcf7c7b8aae6591c209550ac50357c49e5a40a61f9b but this is just showing as 'not found' on any of the blockchain explorers for me..
edit: these were sent from electrum 2.9 I believe and I think its been almost 2 weeks now!
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:29:15
Wow, comparing Snowden to Bin Laden. You are  definitely in line for winning the most retarded post of the year award.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:43:56
Please don't take advice from someone who can't even spell 'buy'.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:50:37
What an absolute shit show of a country.
@_date: 2015-04-26 09:51:04
Hey man, am I too late? :)
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:46:12
Monero is dung. Since Coinhive died nobody cares at all about it.
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:04:38
Oh awesome, where did you get your crystal ball from btw?
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:15:33
This is some high level tin-foil hat retardation right here
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:07:49
Congrats on winning the retard of the day award.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:49:27
Hey man, thanks for the tip, this will be for the Bitcoin beer fund! :-)
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:21:26
@_date: 2015-02-18 09:52:44
Thanks man, i'll happily take a few free bits! 
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:43:06
What's embarrassing is that people still use this ridiculous excuse for a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:12:36
This is a good idea, if you are mentally ill.
