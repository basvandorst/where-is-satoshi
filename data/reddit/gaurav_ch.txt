The idiots are only trying to save themselves as they are scratching their heads while looking at the ways to regulate. They cannot stop crypto so they are scaring people. Ponzi schemes are in fiat currency also. 
The crypto exchanges approached them with an offer to help them understand about crypto but they feel that they are too high and mighty as they are the government. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:24:20
Yes, looks like it as this has happened earlier also. Thanks for the info.

I am a bitcoin user and I have never used bitcoin as currency. I use it as an asset class and it is part of my investment portfolio.
I will never use it as a currency. The reason is simple. Time and Fees. If I am to buy a candy from a shopkeeper, he /she expects the money instantly and not after 10 minutes or 1 confirmation. This is too long a time to wait and you never know whether your transaction will be included in the next block or not. Add to that a fees which is increasing day by day. As a buyer, I would need to pay $1+$0.05 or more for a candy worth $1 only. This is not good for me and I will refrain from using bitcoin for my day to day purchases.
The shopkeeper will not wait and I will not pay a fees. This is the reason why I will not use it as a currency for small transactions.
But if bitcoin is used as an asset class, which has more value after certain period of time, and I would need to buy a house or a car or a yatch with bitcoin, I will gladly do so as the fees is not going to be much in comparison to paying for a candy. And I would be paying less in bitcoins than I would have paid few days back because bitcoin to fiat conversion would fetch me more value.
Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-02-03 09:46:53
How is this done? It is good for knowledge.

I am working on a platform  check it out. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:44:19
Thanks for the reply. Can you elaborate on point 2? Why are they not helpful if I don't use them to receive payments?
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:00:19
To remove scams and repel the fears, the regulations are needed. There are scams because there is no regulation just like what was happening before SEBI was formed. There is a watchdog which lets common people sleep peacefully at night. If there was no regulation on Banks in India, they would bleed people to death like what happens in capitalist economies.
Regulation is need of the hour so that stupid ministers refrain from telling in parliament that bitcoin is evil. Once there is regulation, these politicians will not be making ridiculous statements.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:41:33
It does, in fact, for more people to join. The percentage of people who use bitcoin is very low in comparison to people who invest in gold. We need tech like bitcoin to be adopted as mainstream. 
Once a recognition is given to anything from government, people trust it more. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:09:04
This is what I do. I have an auto buy every day at a fixed time. On the same lines as an SIP. But instead of weekly or monthly I go in for a daily buy as it will be better for dollar cost averaging. I don't care for the price because I am looking at long term. Minimum 5 years.
There is no way to time the market. I bought some bitcoins at $1300 also and now it is below that but it will reach that price again after sometime if this hard fork stupidity does not crash the market.
But I am positive on the growth so I am still buying and I don't store my btc on any exchange as I have been getting mails from them that I will be forced to be on BU if the exchange in question decides on joining BU so I transfer immediately to my wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:56:15
It is standard practice. After 3 confirmations the transaction cannot be changed. When a block is found, it might be possible that it was wrong. So the network confirms that it is correct or not. If not then it is invalid. 1 confirmation means that there is higher probability that the confirmation might also be wrong. 
Most wallets like mycelium only rely on 1 confirmation. Exchanges are just more cautious. Once a block is found, it doe not take a lot of time for confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:49:58
got 1 confirmation after 4 hours.

Thanks guys, I am going to go with Mycelium. I could not figure out how to protect it on iphone using touch id but the touch id is already configured at unlock level so it is not much of a problem. Thanks for your inputs.
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:07:27
Yeah, it was just that I panicked because I was transferring more than 1 btc. I got to know that there is a time calculator based on the fees and I found out that the fees calculated by Xapo would fall in a delayed category.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:42:33
I bought more

I am in for a long haul. This gain was under LIFO method. I have some bitcoins left. You are right it is gambling but then stock market is also gambling. You just need to read the market right.

Thanks guys for your input. The only thing mycelium is missing is a protection layer like pin or pattern lock on Iphone. Is there any setting which enables it?

Yes, it took 1.5 hours to get 1st confirmation. Took so long.

True but just like BTC, Equity market could also crash and burn you to the ground. But trading in BTC is better than equity markets.
High Risk = High Returns
Low Risk = Low Returns
If one does not have a stomach for high risks, best to stay away from BTC.

Umm i found that on android but not iphone.

Go to transactions tab &gt; tap on any old transaction and you will the transaction id and the old address. If address is not to be found tap the transaction id and see on block explorer. You will see couple of addresses there. Compare the amount you received in that transaction and you will see the corresponding old address.
@_date: 2016-11-09 13:51:04
There is no cash ban. Sheesh. You can exchange the notes for newer notes. Of course it needs to be legal. 
1,2,10,20,50,100 notes are still in circulation.
Get a grip. Bitcoin will never replace the currency but it can replace gold as preferred mode of investment. 
Do you think that people holding black money will buy bitcoin via cash? None of the exchanges in India take cash.
@_date: 2016-11-03 10:20:58
Yeah looks like it but also it could be a DDOS attack on their DNS. When i checked last, they still had 1 day to domain expiry. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 18:54:57
Same happened to me and stopped my contract completely. When i asked they said all the stuff which I should have read in the beginning like maintenance fees etc. They are a bunch of scammers just like any other miner out there.

Hi, sorry for being lazy but as a user how can I earn bitcoins? Is it that you will be using my images and selling them to advertisers or the people who come to your website via my link will be served ads?
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:54:21
yes, you can but you need to complete your KYC (Know Your Customer) before you can have an account on Unocoin.
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:32:26
It does not help in anyways. No retailer accepts bitcoin so it cannot be used for day to day small trades.
All the posts here or anywhere are just marketing gimmicks by wallets or exchanges operating out of India. 
You cannot turn useless currency notes into bitcoin on any exchange in India. Only those bitcoin traders who have tons of bitcoin can accept cash and sell you bitcoins but that too is very hard as you need to submit an ID to the government if you are depositing or exchanging old currency notes for newer ones. 
There is very small percentage of people using bitcoins. I use them as digital gold and never a currency. When more than 80% people still don't have or use banking system and rely on currency notes, how can you expect them to even think of using bitcoin with no knowledge.
It is all a speculation and PR stunt. This is driving the prices like crazy. And a high price leads to curiosity. The serious traders have been trading bitcoin for long in India.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:22:35
Agree but i am using iphone and not android. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 06:24:20
No, you treat bitcoin like gold. Buy and sell. That is all you need to know. You don't need to know the technicalities if you are not a programmer. However, you need to know how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:26:00
Ok, this explains no block chain involvement. But they also give a wallet address which can be used to send and receive bitcoins. How does that work?
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:49:10
No. they gave their mumbo jumbo about the difficulty level and whatever bitcoins they gave to me, which they kept with themselves as they were very less amount, were adjusted against the maintenance fees. Their maintenance fees came out to be more than the payouts. So, zero. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 05:10:29
thanks. I was sceptical about it when I started dabbling in bitcoin but I am a convert and a part of my savings are going in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-09 13:47:23
Taxation is the reason why governments are against bitcoin. They can't keep a track of the money flow via bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 17:55:17
Nope. Exchange requires you to give your income tax id and national id. It is not that easy. 
Same goes for gold. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:13:21
An Indian here. It is not just 10 old notes. You can hold max 10 old notes for souvenir purpose and upto 25 for numismatic purpose. The reason the government gave was that the rich people, industrialist etc., who hold tons of black money are still forcing their labourers or workers, who are illiterate, to accept old notes for wages instead of getting bank accounts opened or transfer the wages digitally. 
So, they came out with this decision. To be honest, I have not gone to the bank or stood in ATM queue for cash. Since demonetisation, and before, I have been using credit cards and mobile wallets to get all of my stuff. Even those people who did not had or were resistant to digital ways have started using mobile wallets and cards because they have to now. Cash will be restricted in future also.
The main problem is that people, per se, don't want to change and they don't care about others. We just want the status quo to be same forever.
@_date: 2016-11-17 04:06:48
Off topic but congrats man. If i would have had your foresight, i might also had some bitcoins. Very good decision on your part. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:21:40
Sick of the so called journalists / news mongers who speculate and posts these posts here so that they are benefited from gullible people. 
Cash is not banned in India! Gold imports can be curbed but not banned completely as many banks sell gold and india has particular affinity to gold as at many places owning or wearing gold jewels is considered auspicious.
If cash is banned then the illiterate people and people living below poverty line cannot even buy basic commodities. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:37:37


This p2p transfer is happening in India since last 5 years using mobile wallets already. And unlike bitcoin where minimum 3 confirmations take place after 30 minutes, the p2p fiat transfer is instant.

You mean to say that people should not save rupees but should save in bitcoin/gold? In anycase if I sell my bitcoin/gold today, I will get the fiat money in my bank account and not cash. Cash crunch is the problem.

Only 1% of the Indian population pay income tax as per the official source. There are other taxes on goods and services. 
Business don't take digital payments, even though it is safe and cheaper, because they don't want to pay tax. If we ask them why, they say there are so many scams happening where politicians take tax payers money and pocket it, that they are fed up. Also, they just want to be a thief for their own benefit. Or the customer wants as low price as possible and adding tax increases it so they will not give you an invoice and reduce the price. 
This has become a culture in Indian society. After independence there was a tax of 70%. Businessmen started evading tax and they passed this culture down to their children and it became a norm. So, it is genetic now. I am a service provider and my clients ask that i remove the tax and want to pay in cash as the service tax is 15%. By adding tax they are shelling more. 
No record, no tax. And they all know it is temporary so they want to wait it out. Once cash is in the system, people will go back to it. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:40:45
Yes, I am thinking on these lines.

@_date: 2016-12-29 04:50:10
Thanks for the input. The problem I am trying to solve is hand holding. Many people who use or want to use bitcoin are not tech. savvy. I want to hand hold those people by providing a third person who is not biased to any of the parties involved. I have heard about buyers getting duped by sellers in other countries because they did not use an escrow service and this specially happens in case of bitcoin very easily. So, thought of creating a system where there is a person involved who can answer all of their queries and disputes without going through different customer service hoops.
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:02:52


It says on the home page of  that it is a bitcoin wallet. They have tied up with Visa to give a debit card which can be used for shopping but it is a bitcoin wallet first.
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:37:43
Thanks guys for clarifying it for me.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:11:17
yes. but why the transaction is not showing on other block explorers and the wallet is also not showing the unconfirmed transaction. Earlier I would see the unconfirmed transaction in mycelium.
@_date: 2015-08-31 04:32:09
Oh yeah, lose. Sorry, english is not my first language.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:43:40
probably it is a FUD but this is impacting the bloody exchanges. 2 exchanges, where I have my account, have increased the transaction fees proportionately and which is a lot for my comfort. Probably it is their way of earning more.
@_date: 2015-08-01 08:05:42
I use Xapo which syncs with your web wallet also. It is the most secure wallet till date and I am very impressed with it.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:52:02
oh, does this mean that the miner can take more than 10 min to find a block and it is not the max. limit?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:35:12
Yeah thank god. How can i see if it was a segwit transaction?
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:34:39
Yes, because bitcoin is not being used as currency widely and credit card is being used by everyone. this is the exact scenario which led me to ask the question.
Also, in case of credit card payments, the merchant will not get the amount in his/her bank account in 10 min. It will be settled in 1+ day(s) minimum.
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:19:14
Yes, I think that is right. If I buy a miner, then I would like to get the cost+profit as soon as possible. Once, I do that I will exit the game by selling my bitcoins for fiat as fiat is accepted in the society.
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:16:57
I think you are right that it is a finite resource. And that is why bitcoin is behaving like gold. I recently saw an interview of a chinese bitcoin exchange's chairman and he clarified that in china, they are looking at bitcoin as an asset only and not a currency. 
But if it behaves more like an asset, it will never gain momentum like a currency and people will not part with it just because they can sell it at a premium. Then the very nature of it being termed as global currency diminishes.
@_date: 2015-07-28 10:32:47
What?! for free? are you sure? because last time I checked, they had a fees via which they earn revenue.
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:25:27
No, I don't think it is cumbersome or ineffective as a currency. What I really liked about this is it is faster than sending money to someone who is in another part of the world or even in the same country. In many developing or underdeveloped countries, the money transfer, via banks, sometime takes upto 3 days within the same state or city as the system is not that mature. This is where bitcoin excels. In 10 min I can transfer the money to someone in any part of the world (I know many times people wait for 60 min or 6 confirmations).
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:29:52

@_date: 2017-04-12 02:25:43
There was a person known to me who tried to convince me to put in my bitcoins in their mining operations and he said that he invested 10BTC and got back 20BTC in the form of payouts and referral earnings.

@_date: 2017-04-08 06:16:03
I use paper wallet for storing my bitcoins for long term. There is an issue that using paper wallet, you need to spend or import all the bitcoins at one go as the change is lost otherwise. So, when I have to sell my bitcoins stored in my paper wallet, I import all the bitcoins and send from my mycelium wallet. Then if I have to store the bitcoins back, I send them to my paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:08:12
I am in northern area and i was able to withdraw cash easily. Infact many people have moved back to cash transactions. 
IMO this will force people to use the digital means which is beneficial for the whole economy. With the launch of Aadhaar Pay, you just need your thumb print to pay for stuff. No mobile , no cards needed. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 03:58:31

@_date: 2015-07-29 04:55:26
yes, I also faced some issue when I asked for money withdrawal. Their customer care reps did not respond and I had to ultimately resort to twitter. Finally after a week or so they returned my money.
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:58:02
How many do you want to buy? I have a website  on which you can instantly buy bitcoins using any international visa, mastercard or american express credit card but currently you need an Indian phone number. But I can send you a direct link where you can pay directly on my payment gateway website.
If you want to proceed, pm me. 
Have a look at the website and see the about page also. Feedback is welcomed.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:53:30
As far as i know, they have a stash of bitcoins with them. But the instant bitcoins are just account entry and not actual bitcoin transaction. When you withdraw your bitcoins to your own wallet, they transfer from their stash. It is just plus or minus in their database for instant buy or sell. 
Instant buy does not mean you are in control of your bitcoins. They are in control till you transfer to your wallet. Never store your bitcoins with an exchange as they can be hacked or deny you due to some reason.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:01:16
Same like share market. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:52:05
I am also able to access the website just fine and using the wallet successfully but i am concerned about no replys to support emails or tweet. Like there is a problem with one api endpoint and i asked them anout it many times but no replys.

Black money will be curbed.
@_date: 2017-04-16 18:11:13
If there are many inputs it will be high. Unfortunately you have to pay that high fees if you want to move your bitcoins out of their network. The low fees option does not work with them even though the option is there. I think it is a bug in their system and they don't reply to emails or tweet. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:05:48
It could be just that as the input itself was 0.0711. But seriously if mycelium is not maintaining the iOS version, just remove it from the app store. 
My bad luck with this transaction. ��
@_date: 2017-04-21 04:39:13
An Indian this side. Many people, who are salaried, want to invest in Bitcoin but are unsure as there is no regulatory authority to protect them if there is a fraud. In case of shares trading and mutual funds, there is SEBI, which is pro investors. But yes, the rich are already into it converting black money to Bitcoins so that it is easy to transfer to another country. Some rich are buying bitcoins legally but they are very few. 
Due to non regulation the bitcoin companies are not advertising in papers or media like mutual funds do as they fear a backlash of some stupid government politician. Mind you the politicians are already into it covertly. 
Once there is some regulation like japan, it will be a boon for atleast those who want to invest in it but are afraid. 
Just having this committee is a big thing. I am optimistic that it will be passed as an asset class and not currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:50:10

This is so irrelevant to this thread. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:06:53
They are divided as they are not talking, learning or observing the people who are in bitcoin business. They are only discussing among themselves. The right approach would be to talk to industry experts in an open house or behind closed doors. 
They are right that it can be used for illegal black money, already many people in my circle are doing it, but same can be done with hard cash too. INR, USD, EUR all have a tendency to be used for black money and terrorist financing.
What they need to do is have the same infra as banks for bitcoin exchanges with strict KYC. In this case they can read the paper trail. Cash taken out of an ATM becomes black money instantly if it is used for that purpose.
Tendency of these politicians is to say NO to anything which is new. Lot of officers, who are advising, are out of touch with latest things happening in the world today and their ego hurts if they talk openly to industry experts.
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:06:01
Thanks. This clears the confusion.
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:54:52
Both are ok. Unocoin has bad support these days and i find zebpay's app a little difficult (probably because i am a developer). 
Zebpay is cheaper to buy than unocoin for most of the time. 
I never store my bitcoins with them. I immediately transfer to mycelium. And i have a feeling that if split happens, the exchanges will be with core like what happened with bitcoin xt. 
Never ever store bitcoins with them. If you don't control private keys bitcoins are not yours.
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:56:28

@_date: 2017-07-09 04:27:51
The government has not yet formalized the regulation. It is the exchanges who need an id to safe guard themselves from the wrath of government as lot of people are using bitcoins to launder money. That is the only reason why they want an id.

Yes, you are right that wallet companies can themselves be the bad guy and there are fake wallets on the internet. That is why I follow the ones on bitcoin.org and which are not storing the keys on the server. I use only those which have been around and many people swear by them. Mycelium was my preferred choice but electrum is also fine.
I am buying the dips in small quantities. I have seen the last split of bitcoin xt and that time also people were scared but eventually everyone was with the core version. I will continue to buy as in my experience the bitcoin price just zooms up very fast. Couple of months back it was under Rs. 1L. Bitcoin price will not drop to zero as the market is more stable than couple of years back. More and more institutional investors are in the bitcoin business and they will not let the price to fall zero. I have couple of people in my know who have 200 bitcoins with them and they are ecstatic with the dip as they are buying more and more.
$55K is just speculation. It will not happen. It might go past $5K this year. These so called experts come out with these statements because they want that others take it as a signal to buy and drive the price up. The real experts work in the background and create a strategy to invest.
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:55:07

No mining. I just buy and hodl. I am in for longterm investment minimum 10 years. I did sell for profit as i needed the money. 
I am not confident of altcoins. Most of them are in bubble which will burst sooner or later. Bitcoin being the oldest is going to stabalise soon. 
I keep buying small amounts now and then to average the cost. That ways i am not in loss if i have to sell.

Localbitcoin.in or get a hold of an individual who is willing to sell to you. How many are you looking for? If it is a small amount, localbitcoin is sufficient.

+1. I also got scammed by genesis mining. In fact when i wrote about this on a YouTube video comment, i got a reply from a rep on my 2 year old ticket stating that there are unpaid coins in my account and they are looking into transferring them to me. 
1 month after i asked about the status, they are still looking into it. 
All cloud mining companies are scams. They HAVE to give somebody back. So, you have comments from those people who got their coins back.

I am pro bitcoin but this is plain stupid. Why to pay with bitcoins when the value increases day by day. And such high fees. 
Good marketing though.

1THz in Feb 2015. In October 2015 they reduced it to .5 THz then stopped paying to my wallet in March 2016. They kept storing in my account as the fees was more than the return. When I checked in August​ 2016, my account was 0 btc and 0 hash rate. Asked them , they told me that the maintenance became more than my stored coins so they spent it. No info to me during this time. They took their own decision.
