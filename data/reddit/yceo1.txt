When cybertruck?

U cant trade on hardware wallet like u can on DEX ... hardwallet are best for cold storage ... someone who wants to own keys and trade needs a DEX
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:02:09
It depends on the anonymity and security you are looking for... Hardware wallets like Trezor are good and for the most part secure but you are still susceptible to side channel hacks. Centralized exchanges are the most popular way to store Bitcoin but agin it puts your trust into a 3rd party meaning if they are hack so are your coins. Lastly a decentralized exchange is another method (binancedex, sparkdex, bitshares,etc) which allows you to own the keys to your crypto assets... lmk if you have any questions.

I was thinking bitconnect
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:07:11
No one should care if you really look into the infrastructure being built in the space to make Crypto an even bigger reality. Nasdaq, Bakt, BOA, JPM, and many many more institutions are trying to enter the playing field. From Libra trying to solve global money transfer issues, to companies like Bitspark whom make buying bitcoin more practical for undeveloped countries, in due time everyone will be on the BTC train.

You just sealed an investment to allow you to get the new Cybertruck in 2022 good job!
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:25:39
I agree with this so much... You can’t argue against the current system if you haven’t created a better replacement and Bitspark has... they saw the problems with the current way people buy bitcoin and found a viable solution to change it. They utilize stable coins to provide the unbanked a way to buy and sell crypto with CASH...
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:55:26
Yea you must not have looked hard enough because you would realize Binance isn’t even a competitor.... over half a million cash points globally.... CASH in CASH out ...
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:08:52
Ha, some are so ungrateful! This price is the best gift ever
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:10:16
Black Friday sale came 2 days ago
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:41:19
U cant trade on a hard wallet.. on a Dex you can
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:02:44
We still still in cash king society and other countries to an even further extent . Bitcoin won’tdo away with cash anytime in the near future unless we find a way to get cash converted to crypto
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:06:24
Ha No thanks they are too busy growing a global remittance powerhouse
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:11:31
Right now my best two options for cash transactions are Local Bitcoins and Bitsparks Cash Point system ... will decide who has the best rates
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:21:06
It feels like 2017 again. Behind the smoke and mirrors the new regulations actually don’t mean a thing for most exchanges which are based in HK. Pump incoming [Bitspark](
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:15:11
This is why DEX’s are key in a world where you want full anonymity. Central exchanges (based in US ) have to adhere to the same principles as the financial system already in place. KYC is a joke
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:45:13
Yea I believe so. I have been hearing about Bitspark I can buy at their Cali Mex cash point
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:41:23
Bitcoin can’t make cash obsolete until we get it exchanged better. I.e. walk into store buy a burrito get change and give up fiat for crypto like Bitspark allows. Buying bitcoin right now seems like a privilege and the unbanked population doesn’t have a way in.
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:50:24
This shit comes out year after year.... it doesn’t matter how they feel because bitcoin is now bigger then governments. Chinese regulations state exchanges cant sell securities, which no exchanges sell anyway. This fund is becoming redundant. China is full of retail investors that want Bitcoin or Eth and they aren’t classified as securities.  Exchanges will start moving to Hong Kong like Bitspark and But-Z to flourish unbothered by pointless regs.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:57:26
Honestly, that is what makes some of the best investors rich. They aren’t afraid to buy when everyone else is still in disbelief.
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:04:59
You have that chance again now, fear is at an all time high right now.
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:28:22
I feel that it can hit $10 and I still would be BTFD lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:11:24
You should have been stacking instead of listening to FUD.
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:11:46
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2019-11-28 15:33:58
Not a scam and no one is offering money for free. Just shedding light on an opportunity to earn taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities being a cash point.
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:37:37
Yea so shut up and learn something
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:09:36
Exactly people are ungrateful. If these were stocks they would be screaming about how they chose the right one
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:35:00
If the price were going to the moon some of the things I mentioned would be a factor. Im pro BTC but I guess it just went over your head
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:00:13
Turns out they aren’t actually headquartered in Hong Kong but actually a BVI company so I just wasted 3 hours lol Bitspark it is 
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:30:00
I agree with you , I am really emphasizing the fact that centralized exchanges leave you the most vulnerable out of all options. Whether misuse of funds by the trusted party or hacks, centralized exchanges are the least secure. The history of the DEx dates back to when BTS started it and from there gateway exchanges like Sparkdex were built on top of it. You actually own your keys and no KYC at all. Hardware wallets like Tezos are good choices also.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:59:50
You can do better than that, whats your prediction, have a little fun
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:32:37
Cash buying methods will fuel adoption. Cash to crypto is the simplest way to buy the best performing asset of the decade. It takes the novelty out of crypto. Buying bitcoin shouldn’t be a privilege. Companies like LocalBTC and Bitspark understand this and make it their mission to make BTC available to everyone. Global Bitsprk cash points make it easy for any individual to cash in and out crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:55:42
No these people just realize localbitcoin isn’t the right choice for them. You came to shill and they rejected lol
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:36:08
Hi I was simply stating my opinion. Although, Buying Bitcoin is in fact a safe, non-verbal, and non-violent protest. What is obscure about that statement? 
Have fun reaching the content will continue

This is the most bearlish TA I have seen to date��
Check out the price analysis I use: 
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:00:26
Why do you say?
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:47:09
Still overpriced This is why I love the south
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:43:44
How do we help adoption?
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:56:07
BTC in non fungible
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:58:20
Yea this is a 3 bed rm house in Texas. NY and Cali would be jealous
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:27:26
So potential 200k+ in 2021?? Ok ok
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:19:04
What are the fees for your ATM? Have yet to find one with fees that are reasonable. Cash to crypto will fuel adoption
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:55:28
Halvings take care of quantitative easing .. that last 1% will take years
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:00:04
Why do you think?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:02:29
Millions of young people ate still stacking sats... in some countries many ate looking for a hedge against there own failing currency. Not expecting everyone to have 1 btc but atleast consider adding to eventually have one
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:18:48
Yea thats just too much work and you are forcing someone to opt in to something they may not want... with cash points you can atleast believe in bitcoin, hodling it until you see that you need fiat and go cash out. Bitcoin isn’t ready to be used as a currency yet
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:08:39
Article says you can cash in or out of bitcoin at cash points... you cant pay bills in bitcoin yet or taxes so I way to cash out back to fiat is still important.... you don’t agree?
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:26:18
Security, immutability, math, trust, censor resistant, un fungible, and the people to name a few
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:01:51
Currently Cali-Mex Hong Kong location with new locations on the way I read

Exactly what I was thinking, it is a hedge against a failing system and for what they are fighting for makes sense. An autonomous nation should decide what they feel is valuable. This would in turn strengthen the network . We have seen over and over that fundraising is the overall kill app for crypto. The community would back this 100%
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:31:45
This topic was mainly brought up because of how HSBC shit down their protest donation account. I was looking from a censor resistant, decentralized standpoint.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:18:05
The halvening is in May... some believe it is already price in therefore it will be a non even
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:01:29
And for some he is just an “Athlete” so they are still sleep. BTC is the future and the ones who arent waking up with have the Peter Schiftt mentality. Cash to crypto is becoming popular with Bitspark so over the horizon Bitcoin might be the worlds most liquid asset
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:26:32
$20,000 at the end of 2022? Nahh sooner than that
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:09:06
What is your prediction?
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:44:10
Bitspark does no KYC at cash points for like 1.5%    Cheaper then both methods
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:41:39
Generation Z grew up in the digital era where everything was transformed by the internet. Skepticism derived from not understanding how certain technologies work decreases drastically among Gen Z. A future created by Bitspark where we can use our phones to find someone representing a cash point on a map is a future that used to seem implausible to past generations. Today it is a reality. In fact it is the same “cash to crypto” method that fuels mass adoption. Buying BITCOIN should be simple and a privilege for everybody.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:11:16
Can you buy with cash?
@_date: 2019-12-21 19:37:55
I used at cali mex cash point when I visited HK and the fees with BTC spread came to around 4-5% which is good for how simple the transaction was. Most BTMs in my jurisdiction are generally 8-20% (including spread). I am starting to see more and more 
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:08:33
My job now currently pays in crypto ����
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:54:41
Ahh i got you. ATM for me are 7-10% if they are even available 
Cash points make buying crypto with cash simpler and fees are only 1.5%
Edit: Bitspark cash points
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:43:53
How do we get there?
