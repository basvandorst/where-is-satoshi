**It's hard to decouple politics from Bitcoin**  No payment processor or wallet service has played their cards exactly how I'd like them to at every turn.
BitPay, in my opinion has played a very important role over the years, but they rolled snake eyes by supporting  BIP70 and trying to funnel everyone into their payment protocol and the few wallets that supported it. 
I'm curious why they were pulled from the Google Play store. I'm not a huge fan of BitPay anymore, but they MUST be of the most in-line USA based cryptocurrency companies when it comes to following the crazy banking regulations + compliance laws in the United States.

Can we use Samurai Wallet with. Btcpay Server? I don't see anything about them requiring those **terrible** BIP70 payment URIs that Bitpay requires. 
Also, has anyone had luck with making a Bitcoin Expedia purchase since early May? I'm top tier with them, so I get a direct contact line and quick responses, but they keep sending me walls of text instructing me how to use the Bitcoin payment option that does not appear to exist anymore.

My lightning payments fail with Bitrefill too often :-( 
I've been pushing lightning transactions with them from the start. At this point, I'd like my dang instant transactions. 
A lot of this should be chalked up to the actual lightning network, but when I pay $0.019 for an on chain transaction that is confirmed in 6-12 minutes and am still waiting 10 hours for a lightning transaction, it makes me hope the next bull run is delayed a little longer so the devlopers can engineer us away from $30 transactions.

If you're doing rapid transactions of $1-$150,  settling at zero confirmations is likely fine, especially if you test the fee vs 72 hour averages. 
For example, if someone pushed a $2,000 USD transaction at 110 sat/byte (today), I'd run it against trusted servers and walk away with zero confirmations. 
Most wallets will not push stale, extremely low funded transactions that take more than 90 minutes to clear... actually, most wallets will clear a transaction in the next block (~10 mins)

Before the $7 fee is put on blast for being high:
1) This transaction was a lot more 'complex' than the vast majority of transactions. Let's not overthink the word complex though. 
2) It appears as if Binance could have paid $3.75 for an almost guaranteed confirmation in the next block.
3) Most users will still pay about 6 cents for next block confirmation right now and through most of 2018 besides the madness in January and early February.
4) Permissionless. People theorycraft about calling their bank for a free wire. If you're able to do that, you've already done many, many things beforehand for multiple institutions to grant you the ability to transfer over $600M. You sought permission. You don't need to ask permission with BTC.

Maybe both BCH and SV camps are liquidating to fiat. It looks like this war of attrition is indeed going to happen and the cash burn to sustain the war could be phenomenal. 
Most large trades would be handled by an OTC system, mitigating the price drops on the exchanges, but news of OTC selloffs of this size could reach mainstreet.

I'm not sure how Bitcoin isn't already "inclusive".
The annals of Bitcoin run parallel with Libertarianism.  If we glance at the banner men of Libertarianism, it will be noticed that they are largely, well, men. 
Nobody should be discriminated against, but it's important to note that men haven't been in cahoots to keep women from being interested in Bitcoin. 
Because this movement essentially aims for more adoption, it's good.  The Bitcoin gender usage disparity is more of an opportunity than a problem.

I've paid anywhere from less than 2 cents to 15 cents for next block transactions since about the middle of February. What happened Nov 2017 to the end of January 2018 has seemed to create a long lasting impression that bitcoin transactions are always huge. An assload of network upgrade adoption and exchange tranaction batching techniques have occured since then. 
I'm fine with 2 cent on-chain transactions right now. If they approach 30 cents, I'll fund an even larger lightning channel. Lightning has been working great for me. Instant, practically 0confirmation transactions that cost a penny of a penny.

Where exactly did you plan on putting this? 
Very high chances that your parent's home won't have a conveniently located circuit that will handle a machine that sounds like a rolls royce engine 24/7 and draws 2200w from the wall. Even a 20amp circuit wouldn't support that machine. If you don't immediately trip a breaker, flipping on a light bulb or two would do the trick.

Side note - Few people thought Jerome Powell would be as hawkish as he has been and seemingly will be going forward. He's certainly not going to be on Donald Trump's good side with his roadmap for quantitative tightening. 
Let's keep up this tightening and have the proper painful recession that we deserved in 2007 and beyond. The more we shirk this economic hurt, the more creative and slippery nations will become to avoid using our reserve currency. A quick and proper crash will depants all nations and usher in things that are far less crazy than fiat currency.

It depends on which UTXOs you are using. Chances are that a 1 BTC spend will have to aggregate more UTXOs, meaning a heavier transaction / more block space. 
That 5 cents might go through for .01 BTC but probably not 1 Btc unless you are dealing with primarily big transactions day in and day out.

ZH is generally some fine doom porn, but they'll pitch different sides.
ZH takes a steaming dump on BTC often.. and they often have articles in favor of BTC.
ZH has painted Jay Powell as both a villain and a hero, depending on who the op-ed is (I know... Tyler Durden). Right now, Jerome Powell is pictured with a superman cape.
I believe there is a lot less subversion on Zerohedge than there is on.. say.. Marketwatch or CNBC.

That's a good observation about people crying wolf for quite a long time. Try to consider the fact that we've seen central banks pull out unprecedented moves so they can keep kicking the can down the road.
It has come to the point where they've created more pavement so they can continue to kick the can down the road. Economic engineering is at a previously unimaginable state.

In the end, I'm long stocks on a multi decade time span and have skin in the game in emerging markets, but there are bad times to jump in. 
I believe with BTC, there are good times to buy in and less good times. I don't want to steer us into a pissing contest, but my skepticism towards monetary policy most likely pushed me into the BTC arena at least 18 months to 5+ years before you entered (judging by your top post on I'm glad that I have doubted central planners.

We're in the second longest economic expansion in history... soon to be **the** longest economic expansion in history. The yield curve has officially inverted and we're sitting at a meek interest rate of 250 basis points. The Fed has zero ammunition to pull us out of a very rough landing by resetting the rates to 0%. 
Do you not believe in cycles? Do you not understand debt or even the concept of funny money? What brings you to the Bitcoin realm? Trying to get rich? Well, that's all fine, but Bitcoin was birthed out of skepticism towards central bank monetary policy.

I think you're right about most asset classes. For example, I wouldn't know where to suggest someone allocates 50k USD if they wanted to buy a house 8 months from now.. might as well keep it liquid. 
BUT, have you seen how completely starved the Bitcoin OTC desks are right now? They're begging for sellers at this price range.  Some of the smartest money establishes big, fruitful positions in the time of market bloodbaths. Things could get interesting. We don't have enough history examine how closely coupled BTC is to traditional markets. 
-edit- Woah, the front page is inundated with OTC desk articles lately. Of course you've probably seen these articles. But yes, cash is quite safe now, but a lot of people have plenty of cash, making slumping or new markets especially attractive areas to put the rest of their funds in.

You're definitely correct in pointing out that we're in a huge pickle right now. That incredible debt will impossible to service.
But I believe a lot of Bitcoiners don't enjoy the dramatic Keynesian engineering that Greenspan, Bernanke, and Janet Yellen allowed to happen. Very low interest rate environments foment a lot of poor spending habits, among other things. Bailouts, zero percent interest rates, and quantitative easing kind of walk hand in hand with Keynesian insanity.
Jerome Powell blinking today could have been a clear indication of little confidence in our economy. He was damned either way.

Who shorts Bitcoin? Andreas Antonopolis had great prescience of this in December 2017. Video starts at the direct question, but I'd recommend watching from the beginning and listening hear the original question. It's one of the better ones fielded by Adreas, in my opinion.
