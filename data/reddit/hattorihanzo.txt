Wait? So you are generating the private keys and then sending them to a sticker printer?
How do you expect people to trust you haven't saved a copy of all private keys?

Thanks, It never cease to amaze me of the generosity of some Redditors.  This comment was welcome just as much.

So you pay hosting... for this you could host on $5 a month plan.
And expect me in return to spend $100/hr of my time building shitty affiliate stores and maintaining them for you, and only receive half.  This should be a craigslist ad.

Just forkit and run on your own box. 
AES has replaced DES.

I'm thinking of an option or checkbox on share/export that will do that. right now export will export the encrypted version and share is unencrypted.   Im also thinking of including bitcoin://1xxxx for share links.

Real iffy but here goes
You will need a new NO-CONNECTION computer.
* Decrypt the wallet
* Generate a new address
* Send funds to new addr
* Dump the privkey for the new addr 
* save un-encrypted priv key - preferable to a different usb
 (but it shouldn't matter much because the funds will move in a sec)
 
* encrypt wallet again  (it now has a new - change address - you need it)
move to internet connected pc
* import exposed privkey
* rescan &amp; send said funds
* import privkey on mtgox or blockchain

I will make a github repo for the front-end sometime soon.  And then add support for localization and other features.

P2Pool from what I gather has some Centralization. As there is another p2pool, as well as fee's.  Where does that btc go?  Where in the code can I remove it.  
Then I will mine P2Pool.

You have to use listia. I will prob do a bunch more 1 BTC auctions, so new people will have betters odds at winning some.
Just an easy way for me to help spread some bitcoin lovin.

I like that idea and will see what I can do.
@_date: 2012-01-25 20:52:53
Well, maybe an option to encrypt it with a separate passpharse.  But I think the case would be, I send my friend a private address with 1BTC on it, via email. He then imports it to a full client (or something like MtGox) and moves the funds to an address he knows is secure.  And given the short opportunity window I don't really consider it an issues.  I know email is an unsecure protocol, I mean txt messages are more secure I believe, but its just 1 means of sharing a key. I'm more of a fan of QR codes personally. 
This isn't ment to be the end all be all method, but a simple and easy way to manage address that you load with amounts of btc for a days use.

Ah, so thats a little tricky, and there is probably a better way; you need to decode the rawtransaction hex, and then walk up the inputs looking at the other transactions to find out what address it comes from
    bitcoind decoderawtransaction `bitcoind getrawtransaction "TXID"`
     vin
       bitcoind gettransaction vin.txid

Because 8332 is what bitcoind uses for rpc, and 8333 for bitcoin p2p.
Make it something like 8337, or change your bitcoind rpc port

i dropped 220 btc on the night pre-orders for the asics opened at about ~5.45.
its sunk costs at this point. its not a scam, but they are definitely doing the same math my manager does for guesstimating how long something will take to build.
either way, i think im pretty high (or low) on the list. I wouldn't buy one now... but i probably would.
