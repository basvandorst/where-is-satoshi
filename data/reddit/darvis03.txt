Well if supply goes down (making it harder to get), you don’t think that will increases demand? Increasing prices of course l? I feel like it def will

What trump thing ? Usually if the stock market is doing poor, i noticed crypto reflects the opposite vise versa
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:53:57

@_date: 2019-09-24 23:05:20
How much are the buying fees for bitcoin and all?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:11:36
�� I’ve been losing out using coinbase for the longest time.. they literally pull $5 when i hop in and $5 hopping out on a $300 order.  I’ve been doing it all wrong
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:55:16
Can someone please explain what trump is trying to do in simple terms for me? I don’t understand what he’s trying to do and what the effects it will have on the economy(US)
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:31:30
I see cuz they hold crypto you buy right �� ?therefore of course it never can be sent to other platforms or anything. And wait i mean let’s say i “buy 1 bitcoin”. Can’t i just sell that for fiat $$ and therefore it will just be $$ in my account then were i can reapply into any crypto/stock i choose again? Sorry if that’s a stupid question but just confirming. Also, I used to trade crypto on other platforms like Binance and what not but i don’t have the time anymore to be on top of all of it anymore. It’s just so time consuming! And it’s not like you do it when you have lol, you trade when opportunities arise i feel like �� (always the worst hours) and so with just using Robinhood, I’m hoping for it to just be an easy interest free way of investing when i see opportunities come to just throw in some $$ and hodl till i can make some decent $$ off the investment.. then pull out  all meanwhile periodically adding more and more to the investment if that makes sense

True but 2017 was during a bull market.. we are in a more bearish market now
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:52:26
