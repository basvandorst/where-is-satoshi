Jim Cramer says that Bitcoin futures will *kibosh* (obliterate) the price. Looking at the performance of the stocks he has recommended in the past, this means that 20k is imminent!! Funny video

Why are you being downvoted? People seem not to understand that in order to be an efficient node that others want to connect to, you must keep a large amount of BTC on LN.

haha ok. Just wish the same amount of effort was put into engineering and design as it currently is put into defending ideologies.

Does anyone have any experience with London Block Exchange ( It looks like finally there is an exchange which accepts payments from UK bank accounts in £GBP.

Sounds kinda desperate tbh.

Does balancing on LTN means that to you can only receive as much funds as you have committed to the channel? So to receive 1BTC you need to spend (or send to a different channel) 1BTC first?

In addition to BTC investment, I have some US tech stocks. It's fair to say today has been a pretty volatile day.
There is a lot of talk about technology sell-off being influenced by: 1) Fidelity platform outage ( 2) Money moving into the banking sector
This has in turn affected cryptocurrency space.
Any thoughts?
