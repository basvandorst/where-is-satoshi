Their economy crashing IS the largest problem.
They do use cryptocurrencies, lots of Bitcoin and Dash actually...
However, Bitcoin is more used at the moment as a safe haven to prevent their savings to become worthless.
Also, people are actually farming currencies from games to sell for Bitcoin, and they have 5x modal income!!!

You have been privileged not to witness an economic crash yet... when burning money is cheaper than wood to keep you warm.
Venezuela is a just an example that people are willing to ditch their national currency and switch to cryptocurrencies in difficult times.
And who says USA's economy can't crash? One day you will see how thin this house of cards is.

Lots of people had the privilege of not witnessing hyperinflation and other financial breakdowns. They still have to realize the powerful use cases and potential Bitcoin has and not seeing it solely as a speculative asset.
They will learn soon enough.

So the more the Bitcoin Logo will rotate clockwise the more it's valued? :)

±12° angle = $3,622.28
so a full 360° spin should be $108,668.40
Is this how expert analysts make price predictions? :)

You know, salt used to be a currency in the past, people even got paid partly in salt as salarium.. until they found loads of it. What I'm implying is that scarcity is a key characteristic of money, something fiat currencies lost touch with a while ago when they completely disconnected from the gold standard. Now fiat is only valuable because the governments say so, otherwise it is just paper you can wipe with. I left my country because money was eventually cheaper to burn than wood due to hyperinflation, this is not something you want to experience.
Next to Scarcity, the other main characteristics are  Acceptability, Portability,  Durability, Divisibility and Uniformity. If you need further clarification of these characteristics, let me know.


This is blatantly false and you know it.


Depends on what you look at. Have you ever sent cash to another country ex. family? International money transfers are not cheap... If I'm not in a rush, I adjust to lower fees, it maybe take longer to confirm, but I'm not in a hurry anyway.
But I assume you're talking about coffee payments? Use second layer technology.

There are lots of Crypto debit cards if you truly wish to use Bitcoins right away, I used one till there were issues with the issuer and the card became invalid. However these debit cards are mostly connected through regulated 3rd parties, it kind of removes the main benefit of Bitcoin which is transacting without a 3rd party involved. But yeah, it was good for small payments such as drinks.
Bitcoin is still in a very early stage of adoption, don't forget this. It is getting more user friendly, but we aren't there yet.
