The proof is VIA coin got pumped 100 x on the minute chart, check it out, it's there for everyone to see. I didn't get burned, but a lot of people got their coins sold for VIACOIN. If you think that it's not a hack, you're naive.

r/BinanceExchange , people are saying they got left with VIACOIN in their account, the info is out there, just connect the dots

Of course, if they addmit they were hacked they have to shut down

Let me explain the hack, it happened really fast. They bought for example 100 VIACOIN, hacked the accounts of x number of people through API keys, market sold whatever the account had for bitcoin, and bought the over priced VIA off their hands, getting bitcoins into ONE account to exit the exchange. I don't know if they got out of the exchange, but they definetly hacked it.

Wish it would be true, but just remember, mt gox Lost 800000 bitcoins and only recovered 200000, if they are giving coins back, where are they going to get them from?

compromised is the new word for hacked.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:42:08
The proof is people got their account drained and left with worthless VIACOIN - r/BinanceExchange

Binance got hacked, they denied it, but it' s a fact. Asia Will panic sell for a bit, prepare Fiat or coins backed by the usd.
