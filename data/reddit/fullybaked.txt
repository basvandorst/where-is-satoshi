Listening now, thanks for sharing. Haven't heard from Kevin Rose forever. I was a digg transpant originally.

I just watched the Pilot for Amazon's "Onion News Empire". It was amazing! Check it out for free: 
Edit: This isn't spam, I genuinely liked the show and the pilot is available on Amazon Instant. There are tons of other pilots on there right now too. Guy above me referred to Onion News so that reminded me that I watched it last night on 4/20 and I thought I'd share. Should have been more descriptive. It's highly worth the watch.

Oh sweet! The Walking Dead! I made my first bitcoin purchase earlier this week through humble bundle also! Here come comes my second purchase!

You better watch your back, I'm feeling a craving. We don't want any munchees disappearing around here.

It was actually genuine, hence the reply to the "I love those guys, always make me laugh." because he was referring to Onion News, not the tor network. I know it's off the topic of bitcoin but I loved the show and hadn't heard anything about it until right before I watched it. The comment simply reminded me. I don't see how I would make money from an amazon link and honestly don't care if people downvote it so I'm not going to delete it.

And I can see why. No Problem.
