This is 1 chip on Sealswithclubs Bitcoin Poker. Is your friend feeling Lucky?
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:15:55
These guys are a public company too! They file 10-Qs. I have been very interested to see how a bitcoin-related company's SEC fillings would look.  And intersting that the word "bitcoin" is not used in 10'ks or 10-qs.

With the crackdown on Online poker in the US, I was psyched to be able to play legit poker online for BTC at sealswithclubs. I have had a lot of fun with that.

$1163 was the launch pad. Give it more time/investment and it will blast off.

I AM THE 51%. Dont hate, participate. Personally, I like being part of a pool that hits more blocks than any other. Either grow some competition, or stfu about ghash

Sweeden says Bitcoin is Art, not currency. And that it is Taxable. 
I have always agreed, bitcoin protocol is art in it's own way. Satoshi is/was a genious on Davinci's or Archimedes' level.

here is a bit more detail for you 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:44:20
I am not a ghash employee. I do own GHS and really appreciate what they have done on that front, it is very unique. Other pools could grow larger if they also offered this "cloud mining" feature as well. 
Do you really want to be the type of community that attacks a company or pool, just for growing larger than others? The market made them larger. Advertising made them larger. Smarter actions made them larger.
Attacking them is not the solution, growing other pools and creating competition is the solution.

This is a sentiment I have echoed from the beginning. Oil and Gold will never be denominated in Bitcoin, and that is fine. But for buying coffee, groceries or a new counch, BTC seems to have the advantage.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:53:53
Does not compute... GPU type? Hash rate? Mining Program? Mining Pool? give us some details.

hey u/btcmetice. Did he really just tip you .2? Not bad in 7 minutes.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:05:10
neh. I kind of like being part of a pool that hits more blocks than anyone else. I am the 51%. lol
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:02:20
Can we finally put attacking ghash.io to rest now? Are we good now?
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:51:09
This artcile is full of inaccuracies and misconceptions. Please disregard.

There are still many other exchanges! And the price is different on all of them. This type of arbitrage is nesecarry for bitcoin exchanges at this point in Bicoin's lifecycle. It increases liquidity and helps stablize prices across exchanges. (plus there is a lot of money to be made)
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:44:28
 has an article and bitcoin feature coming?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:06:28
Well put. It is agreed then. No more attacking ghash.io or cex.io. See also(
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:46:35
Then diversify already. Stop talking about it. What are you going to do, "attack them"??. The only acceptable action is to attempt to grow another pool large enough to compete. 'Complaining' about them will not get you anywhere.
Really, I thought we were past this.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:18:56
So then who does have influence? What organization, mining pool, forum, or bitcoin millionaire does? What group owns and uses large amounts of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:44:21
coinbase is still not too bad at +1% fee. Also more secure than others.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:48:33
as a matter of fact, I do, and I have been looking for the best place to invest in in BTC. What makes you think ATMs are the way to go?

Straight from the man himself: 
Around 21:17-23:20
They use "all current available data sets" to source a price, then "add 1%". More of a marketplace than an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:51:16
DTC and DTCC also handle clearing. As an investment bank employee that sees Swift, Fedwire and DTC in action every day, I definately see how bitcoin protocol could influence the way banks transfer funds in the future. Traits inherent in bitcoin protocol like irreversibility, and traceablity of transactions could greatly improve fund transfer efficiency.
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:13:49
pst. that is what all the FinCEN and NSA agents say on reddit boards. Seriously though, there are countless resources looking at the economic implications of bitcoin. If done correctly, this report could be quite enlightening. Good luck
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:21:33
Those are simply the syptoms and results of a Ponzi Scheme. There is always a person or group behind a ponzi scheme, but there is no person or group "selling" bitcoin, promising returns and leaving with the money. Highly flawed analogy.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:45:39
I really like this idea. I have considered doing this myself. I started by leaving flyers with my own qr and reference to blockchain and coinbase, but stopped. Your idea is much more empowering for bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-04 04:39:11
Well put. You can trade back your GHS for BTC again at any time, and earn shares from a massive mining pool in the interm. I like the cex.io system.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:52:09
This is a very good point. For USD, companies like Goldman help provide the liqudity and price stability by spotting these arbirage oppotunities in prices across exchanges, buy up the lower price, and sell down the higher. A 'market maker' in the BTC world could help achieve this. This is a vital market function.

This is a tad off-base. Very simplistic.

I would love to get involved with a BTC ATM company as well. EXPECIALLY in Boston. However, a reddit post may not be the best place to search for these strategic partnerships. There are extensive venture/crowdfunding options available (especially in Boston.) Go Pats.
