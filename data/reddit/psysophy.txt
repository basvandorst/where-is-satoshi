You do realize it reached 1/6th of bitcoin's market cap? Lmao
@_date: 2016-08-21 16:22:20
Wtf you on about now?
@_date: 2016-08-22 23:39:18
I liked the page out of how ironic and funny it is they made a facebook page.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:12:07
Mods, how do I tell him what altcoin we're talking about here when I'm not allowed to refer to it by name?
@_date: 2016-04-02 17:13:43
Anyone know a watch set up that could let me see the price like this but in realtime? Rather than updated 2-3 times per hour.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:52:36
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:23:56
How do you propose this is done?
@_date: 2015-12-18 00:06:10
Are you assuming consumers aren't motivated to invest without inflation?
I'd still be motivated to invest without inflation. I don't see it. Seems stupid to me to defend inflation because it might push people a little bit extra to invest.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:29:42
I guess it's an experiment then.
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:21:50
Jesus christ.. Tone it down a little?
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:56:18
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:50:27
They're just deluded.
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:48:14
Could you show me an example of something positive about a Western government, or conventional banking, or anything that doesn't support a Libertarian ideal, that ended up at the bottom of the thread?
I'm asking because there often seems to be a lot of confusion as to why posts are *actually* downvoted.
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:51:37
I can buy them unloaded.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:00:02
Would it have to be conspiracy?
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:30:00
I don't know what kind of exact answer you're looking for. I got some as Christmas gifts.
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:03:06
Lol, having a little hard time with the character assassination there?
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:19:25
So meta.
@_date: 2015-12-16 17:06:51
A real possibility.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:07:54
And why's the score hidden on posts that are hours old??
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:05:14
I'm sure it's been powered by a *little bit* of altruism as well. Bitcoin can help a lot of people and I think more than a couple bitcoiners know that, and have been putting their time and energy into it for that reason...
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:12:16
We should all regularly edit our comments to display our points.
Edit: +5
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:06:49
What propaganda is that?
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:28:31
Ah. That's odd.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:37:51
I want to see him move some coins.
@_date: 2016-03-12 23:06:53
I would, but I don't know enough to form an opinion either direction, according to my own principles of knowledge. If I do educate myself on the issue in the future I'll make sure to get back to you with a solid explanation if you like.
Edit: Lol bet the downvoters are butthurt because they formed an opinion long before they should have. Learn to epistemology.
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:24:43
Hey BashCo, why are the comment scores hidden?
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:20:52
I'm surprised this thread hasn't been deleted. I suppose that it's at the point now where deleting threads of this caliber does more harm to the narrative.
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:43:52
+60% in 6 months is just a breeze for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:08:34
That won't happen because the comment will be deleted.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:30:03
So is a stock.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:34:26
I dislike upvoting threads on r/bitcoin, but this definitely deserves an upvote.
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:08:06
Okay, I just wanted to hear the current narrative on that too.
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:46:24
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:28:25
This cost 6000 bitcoins? Cool.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:43:38

Edit: Wow you downvoters are such boiling frogs. Threads just mentioning censorship used to be deleted half a year ago.
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:57:24
You don't hold the stick, you don't own the stick.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:10:48
I wonder how many downvotes this sticky has.
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:03:19
Oh yeah, shit, what a stupid accusation. /s
Have you been living under a rock?
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:12:18
Wow, don't flatter yourselves.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:09:32
[Here's]( even more material for you.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:57:25


How come? Couldn't society get better overall at producing if the bottom did?
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:03:47
And is socialism why they can't make more money? If so, how come?
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:02:03
I always see a different reasoning given as an argument for why socialism works in Scandinavia. It can't just be because the socialism implemented there works just right, and in other places it's implemented in a different way?
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:07:40
Yes it's a trade-off, that much I understand. But you don't think the way proposed is a smart enough trade-off? I personally don't see much damage needed to be done at all in order to lift the bottom up a significant amount that'd reward society as a whole. But this would be numbers and probability crunching wouldn't it?
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:15:07
Or a place with less competition, I presume. I understand how it makes for less growth. Personally, the question I see and would like explored practically is what kind of an effect lifting society from the bottom up has holistically.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:29:46


I've seen this idea a few times over the years, and think it deserves more attention. I like this idea a lot and think that it should be heavily considered to be added into a hard fork. Is there anyone reading this comment with technical knowledge on this?
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:48:22
Whatever happened to Dark Wallet?
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:43:21
Yeah look how that's going. Sounds like a cake walk in theory.
@_date: 2015-09-14 15:59:35
Oh no, drugs. That deserves a solid downvote.
You're right, the way r/bitcoin and bitcointalk is run is absolutely not fine. But unless someone can send the admins a large overview and detailed message compiled of good arguments, nothing's going to be done because of how Reddit is run.
On that topic, I think the Reddit admins should add a new condition, which is that if the majority of active users in a subreddit dislike the way the subreddit is moderated, the moderators should be kicked off. Question then is how a new owner of the subreddit is chosen.
Edit: wow, lagged vote brigades still happen in r/bitcoin. This post had a positive score.
@_date: 2015-09-15 10:02:23
Nope. Evidently not in this case.
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:50:46
Lol, I thought votes would illustrate my reply to that, but it looks like you got a flock of upvotes.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:16:59
inb4 thread removal
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:38:17
inb4 comments start getting deleted

I'd mine.

So Barbados might join as a hodler
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:35:16
I dare Coinbase to do it.
@_date: 2015-11-18 19:51:32
Interesting vote brigade on your comment and mine.
Regarding having a heavy slant, do you know the intention of @_date: 2015-10-20 10:25:32
Should've been lifetime, according to a recent sentence.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:13:45
It was 1st most popular a few days ago.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:41:39
Are you joking?
And this sticky explains what's considered trolling clear enough to be honest.
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:56:49
@_date: 2015-10-15 23:35:52
What's the evidence for insanity? Did he frequent buttcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:09:36
Well then I guess we shouldn't be talking about it
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:06:54
Yah me too. Maybe 10 though, don't wanna take too much of a risk.
