here i was, sitting and looking at my little "exchange wallet" on bitcoin.de, wondering why the bitcoin course dropped from almost 500 EUR down to 416 (right now)... MtGOX again! should've thought of them. i hope they bail out completely of the whole vryptocurrency thing soon..

I’d like to ask you to remember where you were a decade or so ago, in the year 2000. I’m going to list some of the things that have happened since then. Did it cross your mind that we would see… 
• Two stock market crashes of 1929 proportions and a financial crisis that almost brought down the entire global banking system. 
• Youth unemployment in Greece at 62.5%, Spain at 57%, Portugal at 43%, Italy at 40% and an EU average of 24.4%. Or the Greeks calling Germans Nazis. 
• Interest rates in the US at 0.25% and in the UK at 0.5% for years on end, runs on banks as people discover their money isn’t safe and the Bank of England actually printing money. 
• A gap between rich and poor that has grown so big the richest 400 people in the world have assets equivalent to the poorest 140 million. The wealthiest 1% of Americans pocket a quarter of the country’s income and control as much as half of the nation’s total wealth, with CEOs of large banks and other large corporations earning as much as a thousand times more than low-ranking employees. 
• The average age of the first-time UK house buyer at almost 40, with an entire generation of people in the UK that believing they will never own a home. Yet only 2.5% of British land is actually built on. 
• Obesity rates of 25% in the developed world, yet almost a billion people suffering from chronic undernourishment, while over half the food we produce – some 2 billion tonnes – gets thrown away each year. 
• 36 million people across the globe taking part in 3,000 protests against a war in the Middle East – and UK and US government ignoring them and going ahead with it anyway. 
• Healthcare spending more than doubling from £68 billion to £143 billion in the 11 years to 2011, yet ‘basic clinical failings’ being commonplace across the NHS – with one NHS trust found liable for 1,200 people dying while in its care and a further five trusts facing investigation. 
• Spending on schools in the UK rising by over 86%, while the Ofsted chief inspector declares ‘standards have stalled’. 
• And debt. Oh, my goodness. The UK currently owes, excluding bank bail-out costs, just under £1.2 trillion. That’s almost £40,000 per working person. In just five years the coalition government, on a so-called austerity drive, will add £700 billion to the national debt. That’s more than the combined total of every British government of the past 100 years. 
For all the talk of ‘fiscal cliffs’ and ‘debt ceilings’ in the US, President Barack Obama has overseen an administration that, in its first term, increased the national debt by 60%, adding $6 trillion. The first 41 presidents only managed $5 trillion combined. Many of these things were unthinkable ten years ago, yet they are now part of our daily experience. A lot seems to be going wrong. Is this just an inevitable fact of life, or is it something else? I happen to think it’s something else. And that’s what this book is about. 
Many of our most fundamental institutions, social arrangements, economic policies and political ideas seem to be breaking down. They are either in acute crisis, or close to it. Things that we have taken for granted for decades – that a bank is a safe place to put money, that the NHS looks after its patients, or that European countries have left the conflicts of the Second World War behind them, for example – are now in doubt. If we are coming to some sort of boiling point, it’s essential to understand what the fundamental problems actually are and how they came about, otherwise there is the real danger that, misguidedly, we replace what we have with something worse – as happened with Fidel Castro’s great Cuban revolution, Communist Russia and Nazi Germany. 
‘Only a crisis – actual or perceived,’ said economist Milton Friedman, ‘produces real change. 
When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable. I subscribe to George Orwell’s view that, ‘on the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.’ 
The problem, as I see it, is not so much individuals but systems. 
Accidentally or otherwise, our systems of government, finance and economics have been modified and manipulated and now no longer have the effects their originators intended; they have become entrenched, out of anyone’s control, and seemingly possible to change or remove. It feels like the West is an unstoppable train, hurtling down the tracks; but we are on the wrong tracks, going to the wrong place. Nothing seems to slow this train, let alone reverse it. It’s too big; it’s going too fast.

a small BTC generator, similar in shape and appearance like this TAN generator
you stick your debit card in, scan a QR code of a wallet you want to pay to, enter the amount of EUR or BTC (you can mae that choice) confirm with your pin and the device would automaticlly convert to BTC(if needed - actuall course, connection to some internet infrastructure mandatory) and send to this adress.
the device would have the QR of his receiving adress on the backside (better, a transparent pocket for a paper with the QR, to easily change adresses, like [the one on top of this pocket]( and would need a PIN(different to the one of the card) to confirm the transactions. 
i know that this isnt a software tool, but thats the only one i find neccessary if bitcoin should become something in average joe's life. 
maybe you can use your know how to built a concept behind this ida, and then present it to some hardware manufacturers (like the ones who are building the ASICs right now)

please excuse my stupid questions:
- how many traffic do i have to bare with if i run a node?
- do i need to set up an Bitcoin adress as some kind of "relais", or will the software take care of all this?
- will a DSL 16000 Line (16000kb down, 2000kb up) be fast enough, and will it be still fast enough to my personal needs (surfing/streaming youtube and online gaming)?
@_date: 2014-02-03 13:18:58
you're right. not yet.  but wouldn't it be at least fraud or something?
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:40:06
it also shows that there are enough people WILLINGLY and KNOWINGLY spreading false information about BTC to accomplish their own goals (whatever they may be). but that has always been an issuse. we have to be louder then them. simple.

people who use "should of" instead of "should have" should be punished. i am not a native english speaker - DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD TO READ THIS SHIT IS? in many other languages an the translation equivalent of an "of" instead of an "have" turns sentences and meanings in a totally different direction.

@_date: 2014-04-16 08:54:44
could be. but the truth is: the whole bitcoin market is so small that it wouldn't really be worth a gouverment size prize manipulation operation. maybe the boss of the cinese bank and some friends of his wanted to buy bitcoins for themself, and are now wathcing their wealth grow?! even if you buy all available bitcoins and gain 200 $ from each, it would hardly be enough to make it an official operation

those grades for music /arts were used to generate my medium grade (over all classes) this medium grade was later used in applying for training and university. if this medium grade had been pulled down because i wasn't bodily able to hold a tone as long as the teacher wanted me to, then the whole grade system becomes meaningless.
i am happily ignoring my school grades for the last 12 years or so. for people that just took the step from school to job training / univerity those grades are very important.

those "retards" were scammed out of money. it doesn't matter if it was because of a long planned scamming scheme, or stupitidy. they lost something that other people have right now because someone else made false decisions. they have the right to be upset.

i loved the answer of the dutch gouverment when the first investors demanded to bail them out, it was something in the lines of: "we came to the conclusion that the whloe phenomenon has to be some kind of "tulip fever. in cases of fever a visit at the doctor is recommended, the gouverment can not be bothered with it".
man i wished our gouverments had the balls to do this when the whole housing market and investment gigs broke down because of the greedy people.

15$ "maintanance"? how often do you pay this? monthly? p.a.? 
your bank account is a dataset in a database in a datacenter of your bank. just a bunch of 0s and 1s. just like bitcoin. 15$ (even per year) is in no way a fair amount of money to "maintain" that.

if you take in consideration that you need:
- a lot of expensive hashing hardware
- luck
- the will and the plan to break a law and take a high risk
you would be better with making false USD. easier and not so traceable. so the "panic" about the double spent blocks is -for now- just that: panic.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:37:28
this would also work as a mobile POS, yes. the key would be that it would be smaller then a smartphone, with hardened hardware  (some encryption chip for the transaction) and standardized design, so that manipulated devices would be easier to identify.

stupid policy. a MRAP is a very heavy armoured vehicle, that should only be used in extreme situations. You don't have those because you need them, you have those because you dont ever want to use them (like an airbag in a car for instance), but IF you need them you can count on them

[Tradeblock.com]( lists it, blockchain.info doesn't show it anymore.
the question: will it be confirmed eventually, or will it get stuck in this state forever?
