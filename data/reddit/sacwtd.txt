Thank you for posting this, this was the final piece of the puzzle for me towards really securing cold storage
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:33:30
You are right, it will get worse as time goes forward and more transactions happen.
These days people recommend the use of a 'lightweight' wallet like Multibit vs the full bitcoin-qt as most users do not need to download the full blockchain.  The lightweight wallets base their chain off some 'checkpoint' that the developers agree do.
In the future, the developers may perhaps decided to prune off old transactions, but who knows.
The mobile (and web) wallets are really just a frontend to some remote full node.  Take for instance Blockchain.info.  They maintain the full node, and what you get is a very lightweight client that doesn't care about the blockchain as it is being handled on a server somewhere.  The security of these types of wallets can vary greatly, from the server knowing your private key, to special client side Javascript implementations that handle unencrypting your private key (blockchain.info does this).  
You should consider moving some of your bitcoin to so-called 'cold storage'.  Typically, what you would want is some spending money in a mobile wallet of whatever amount you'd be comfortable with losing if something should happen, and move the rest to an offline, paper wallet.  Think of it as what you would do with your paycheck.  You'd keep $20 in your pocket to buy lunch with, but the rest you'd deposit in the bank.
EDIT: corrected Java to Javascript
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:26:40
Receiving money via bitcoin is super easy, your customer just needs to know your sending address (as described above with the QR code).  You should likely make sure that when they do pay you that you get a confirmation or two to make sure the network saw the transaction (if you are using a mobile wallet like blockchain's it'll pop up a notifcation)
Mind you, if you want to convert your bitcoin into fiat, you'll need an account somewhere like Coinbase to actually sell your bitcoin for USD, and that will take a few days to setup.  You don't need to do this first to get bitcoin from your customers, though.

You had to verify your bank account by entering the two deposit amounts they put in your bank via ACH. This would take 3 to 4 days. Then you were clear to buy up to 10btc or so at a time, but there was a 4 day wait until you got the btc. Once you had done this and 30 days had passed without anything bad happening, you were then cleared to instant buy 10 or 20btc without the wait.

Look at their blog. They posted about an issue back in February and I don't think they have fully mitigated it. Basically, if one transaction hangs up, everyone else getting coin out of that address get stuck until it clears. I sent 0.0015 btc to block chain yesterday and it took almost 8 hours to clear due to this. I sent another 0.0015 and it confirmed immediately. 
Looks like they still have some work to do with how they use their hot wallet and handle tons of transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:24:24
Exactly.  I expected 2 small deposits and a single withdrawal, but instead I have seen 4 withdrawals and no deposit.  Can't verify that way.

Imagine a bitcoin address as being a piece of paper money.
Let's say you have a $20 bill and you buy something that is $1.  You don't expect the clerk to rip off part of the $20 and hand it back, she's going to take the $20 and hand you back $19.  Bitcoin addresses work the same way.
You'd load a value into an address, and it becomes a 'bill' worth that much.  When you go to spend it, you consume it entirely, with part going to the payee, and part being your change that you send back to yourself.
You can send the change back to the same address, but you typically don't, in case the private key for that address is compromised.

Bitcoin has about the same anonymity as using cash. Cash has serial numbers and could be tracked if enough effort was put in, and there are ways of mixing up cash with other people's cash to add in doubt as to where the cash came from.

A ton of hash power got on feathercoin, mined it until the difficulty went high, then left. Suddenly no one was solving blocks and a lot of the remaining miners left. It took months for the difficulty to readjust, in the meantime transactions were super slow.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:58:08
You are quite right, I was not thinking clearly.  However, the blockchain.info wallet seems to be alone in that all the private key encryption/decryption is done clientside, the server never has access to the private key at all.  Or at least, insofar as I am aware.
I'll edit my comment.

Send your coins through a mixing service. Use coins you mined that don't have a trail from anywhere but the coinbase they were mined from. Anonymity is possible with bitcoin, but it's not always immediately obvious how to go about it.
The us mint knows where it sent certain serial numbers out. Banks can track those numbers if the govt is watching for them, like money stolen from a bank.

You can generate a valid pub/priv keypair that can accept bitcoin without it actually having anything associated with it now.
That is to say, (and what you should be doing), is to print a sheet of pre-generated paper wallets with a public address and a (highly suggested) BIP0038 encrypted private address.  Then, you could scan the public qr code and transfer money to it.  You would never scan the private address until you were ready to spend the money on the address, and which point you would send your change/savings to the next unused address on your sheet of paper wallets.
Empty, new wallets will not show up on blockchain.info

I had a friend who posted, asking what it was.  By the time I got there, most people had offered up things like stolen bitcoins, ponzi schemes, etc.  I tried very hard to clarify for my friend what it was, but to him it boiled down to that it didn't do anything that a moneygram or a credit card didn't already do, it was too unsafe, and 'investing' in it was actually gambling your money away and he wanted no part in it.
My wife was beside herself at the idea of it.  'Magic internet money' as she called it had no worth, there was no way you could get money back out of it.  'Who, sacwtd, who is going to buy your *hand motions* magic internet money??!  No one!  It's worthless!'  Couldn't manage to explain it much, but I do note that since what little I have has quadrupled in price she doesn't get as dramatic about it.
I've only had one friend so far that was interested, so I made him a paper wallet and put a buck in it (worth almost 4 bucks now!) and he's been enjoying trying to figure out when I should sell before the bubble bursts.
I'm not really interested in promoting it to my friends at this point.  They can come ask me if they want info or some coin.
