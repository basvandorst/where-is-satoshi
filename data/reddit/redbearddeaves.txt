Ahh makes more sense now thank you for that.  Is there rmd's or limits to how.much you could take out yearly? Penalties?

Broad financial seems like a much better investment now that I've done some research.  Check it out.

Thank you for your post.  I have a inherited ira from the death of my mom last year and have been thinking about doing something like this but didn't realize it was possible.  I was gonna take the money out but that would cost me 30% of the account in taxes.  You said with broad financial it was aroind 2k total even with the rollover?  So no tax implications from inherited ira to broad financial?  Also why did you have to open all those accounts on exchanges if everything was being saved on your trezor?  I'm relatively new to this and have only used Coinbase and shapeshift since march.  Thanks again and look forward to a response if you read this.

Interesting.  Did you have to fill out same stuff for Gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:42:49
Any luck with itbit?

First two check!  Were the documents about forming the IRA the transfer and investment authorization forms?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:29:38
Did you have to file a IRS form ss4 when setting up your business account from bank you chose?

What is slack?

What documents did you have to send ItBit?

Why would it be so bad to sell right now?  Some kind of correction is bound to take place before or after the fork, right?  But i guess we just broke $6100 it can keep going higher and higher?

Hey Dan, i have personal accounts on coinbase, gdax, bittrex and binance.  Im a little confused how you sign up with your LLC.  Im currently almost done with the whole broad financial setup and have my llc name but have no idea how to get in on the exchange through that account.  Was gonna do itbtc since you said that was the fastest.  Any tips on getting this set up properly?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:58:00
No, snapshot not received.  What until 11pm Pacific
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:36:21
What exchange?  How do you get a limit that high?  Bank wire?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:35:57
That's the plan for many of us.  Personally I'm seeing how it plays out and i have some extra funds on the side if i wanna get some cheap alts etc..
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:24:09
Ledger is the best bet but wait for the snapshot (1 hour max) then do you.  Price will ath in 2 days after alts moon as well
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:32:29
Yes, but you have to hold your btc Oct 25 through Nov 1st and you will recieve an equal amount btg (bitcoin gold).  Even with yours being deposited on the 27th i think you should be fine if you hold through Nov. 1st
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:16:23
Thanks Dan for the help.  Clears things up a bit
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:13:25
Im talking price.  Many alt prices rise when bitcoin does
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:24:04
Since you used Coinbase you can't sell anything and get your potential profits now until the transaction goes through - in your case the 27th.  You can buy more but can't sell anything so you're forced to hold until the btc is deposited by Coinbase. 
As far as selling out of your position (if you could) or anyone for that matter; i would advise to just hold unless there starts to be a big correction.  We've been straight to the moon recently with a few hundred dollar pullbacks here and there.  Biggest one i recall this week was down to $5100 and then it was right back up.  Hold and keep those profits

Always invest in something you can't afford.  Buy the ticket, take the ride my friend
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:00:56
Yobit has the futures on gold but you're wasting your time. Hold and you'll be fine. In a week or less we will have another ath
If you have funds on the sidelines you can buy the dip abd profit but imo I'd see how the next 48 hours + plays out
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:36:41
Strange seeing most alts not rising with bitcoin.  Seems like they usually go hand in hand.  Why this feels so weird right now pre fork.  I think we will go back down but what the hell do i know
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:15:59
You got about 45 minutes but that's according to conflicting reports.  Just wait for it.  Where is your btc stored if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:49:07
What about ledger nano s?  How do you access gold?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:08:21
Fair enough.  Wait until the fork and then cash out what you want after the snapshot and you're good.  
Doesn't hurt to know what exchange or method of withdrawal you prefer 
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:46:55
Did you go with the roth ira?  Seems like the better option, No?  Thinking about setting mine up with broad on Monday
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:53:55
Makes sense but still the random bitcoiner can do the exact same thing - sell the high and then buy a bit lower and grab that profit.  Not so easy but doable.  I've heard about Bitconnect through some YouTube vids.  Looks like it's based on referrals and the ones at the top are making big money.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:37:31
Appreciate the clarification trash panda
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:00:28
No lol believe it or not but ive just signed up for reddit and i am in no way shape or form associated with anyone but myself.  I agree there has been some issues with coinbase but what deep drops are ypu talking about in the last 6 months?  I was able to purchase below $1000 when i made my first deposit while it was dropping big time and many other times the last 6 months when there were considerable price corrections
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:46:31
Glad you got it worked out.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:40:24
Ive always been able to buy when the market has been down outside of one time and the flash crash 
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:14:04
Lower the withdrawal amount.  Ballpark how much you trying to withdrawal?  I had to do a few medoum sized withdrawals in a row because the same thing was happening to me
