This is no error. This is a test to see what happens if done on a large scale. Now they'll do it more discreetly with bogus reasons for demonetization and strikes.

The human manure literally uses propaganda campaigns to better his self esteem not anything else. If he really was an agent for open secrets we would get unbiased info on all countries and regimes. Not just the USA and how he hates Hillary.

Never put funds that's important in a shit tier exchange. Period. I pulled out all crypto in 2018 from coinbase because of their debit card fraud issues and kyc bs

I was using a shit tier nvidia 710 I think when I mined some for fun back in the day.

im waiting for 1800-1200 to buy in. just like 2013 and previous years hash rate falls then price plummets then accumulation begins. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:35:36
I'm waiting on 2k to 1800 myself. This still has a ways to go based on difficulty and hash rates. As of right now its at 11.6 minutes. The last time this happened we had a short term prices dipped then went parabolic.

Fast markets make me have massive headaches.  But thankfully I bought with a bitcoin atm. It costs a premium but funds are available within 2 hours or less. Fastest was 10 minutes after 4 confirmations.

If we break 6k then we have something. Till then wait for the next fall down and accumulate during the dips. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:45:55
Put in stops. But dips and accumulate until back to mean.

honestly i could have got in at .06 cents. some dude was offering me around 2000 btc at .06-.08 cents for my graphics card and i turned him down since i didnt know what the hell btc was.
