I'm curious why you picked DCA over Value Averaging? It seems like Value Averaging almost always wins over DCA, but people keep doing DCA for some reason.

I dont see why VA is more active than DCA. You do the same number of transactions as DCA. 
Yes, selling can add a tax reporting burden, but if you are doing it inside of a tax-sheltering instrument (such as a 401k, RRSP for you canucks), you don't need to worry about that. That said, I dont know anywhere that you can do BTC inside of a 401k :)
If you compare the DCA and VA using S&amp;P 500 prices (using  transacting once a month for one year (jan 17th, through feb 16) , using $5,000 for the amount to invest each month in DCA, and $5,000 being the Value Path for VA, you get:
 |Average Cost|Total Cost|Current Value|Current Gain|Return (IRR)
Dollar Cost Average|	$2,087.39|	$60,000.00|	$64,865.22|	$4,865.22|	1.19%
Value Average|	$2,075.84|	$55,192.72|	$60,000.00|	$4,807.28|	1.23%
Lump Sum|	$2,038.20|	$60,000.00|	$66,430.67|	$6,430.67|	10.72%
If we take the same period, and amounts for BTC vs. USD (using 
 |Average Cost|Total Cost|Current Value|Current Gain|Return (IRR)
Dollar Cost Average|	$550.85|	$60,000.00|	$105,504.45|	$45,504.45|	8.42%
Value Average|	$389.33|	$24,116.56|	$60,000.00|	$35,883.44|	8.93%
Lump Sum|	$367.67|	$60,000.00|	$158,068.92|	$98,068.92|	163.45%
As you can see, in both you win with Lump Sum -&gt; VA -&gt; DCA.
In the Wikipedia article you cite it talks about some 40 page paper ( this (one) person seems to say the IRR is a bad indicator, but I have not been able to understand wtf they are talking about. Maybe they are right, but I dont understand it.
One of the criticisms in the wikipedia article is talking about how you end up holding more cash with VA, but I think that is only in comparison to a Lump Sum (Buy and Hold) strategy, and would apply to DCA too.
In any case, DCA also has its fair share of criticisms, in fact more than VA does (perhaps because it has been around a lot longer):
