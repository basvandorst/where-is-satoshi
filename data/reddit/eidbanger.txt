$300/week. I just opened up the account.
EDIT: Well, I just requested my limit to go up. And within seconds it was approved to go up to $3k/week. wow. But, is there some kind of conversion fee Circle does to go from USD to Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:56:02
Just bitcoin. Haven't studying up much on ether or litecoin, etc...
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:10:34
After noticing other posts about shitty coinbase support somebody suggested circle. Is that the best alternative? I just want to buy a fucking trezor goddammit while it's on sale.

Recommend any info on ethereum? Heard of it a couple of times, wish to read up on its similarities/differences from Bitcoin. Litecoin seems like its not going anywhere.

What does that last sentence mean? Retest 4-500? Seems to me like you're saying I could buy at 500/coin?

Thanks.

Do you want to put yourself in a position where you can lose everything? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:49:26
I have a theory that whenever bitcoin stagnates in price action that's when BCH and other alts get pumped.

Awesome. Thank you!

Is there a way to calculate the premium on CXBTF?

From the article - "Fidelity is the fourth largest assets manager with $2.4 trillion in assets under its management. The multinational financial services corporation is based in Boston, Massachusetts.". I'd say very popular.

Today, I might have a drink. I might not.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:14:10
Sure. How many you want?

How would a segwit split be good for the price?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:41:35
I remember when 8888 CNY happened we had a good correction. Now we're soon to hit 8888 USD. Not trying to spread FUD, just something to consider.

I made 5x. So yea. But 100x? Man...
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:50:51
Grats. Don't gamble more than you can afford to lose. This is definitely more believable than that guy who says he made $1M from a 10k start from a year ago.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:35:56
Totally. But maybe he actively trades? I keep a small portion of my funds on bittrex to trade. Maybe $150k is a small portion for him...
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:32:59
Here's a start for you. Bittrex is one of them. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:40:33
Also, I'm sure you can, but is it possible to send to yourself using the trezor?
@_date: 2016-09-08 10:10:51
Found this: 
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:57:05
Also, you could just use the basic Trezor wallet. It works simply.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:29:53
You can have both. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:39:03
Lol I was just about to post the same thing. That's like 7% immediate loss. ��
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:33:55
Such bullshit. 1% maker/taker fee for low volume traders. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:15:28
GBTC? Still overpriced?
