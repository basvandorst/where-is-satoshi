BTW your console keeps crashing because you're using Microsoft Operating systems, PERIOD.  Maybe you should try a NATIVE-CLI like fedora, red-hat, or any of the 100's of "flavors" available for free, son...
P.S. you're grounded, now go clean your room.

See, he used facts and remembered his manners.  How hard was that?  
Bitcoin sounds like an excellent idea, and as I have watched it grow, I started to question how it would function if it were attacked by hackers, or if a big chunk of the infrastructure was to take a hit from something like a natural disaster or a nuclear bomb.  Metals were the most basic comparison that I could come up with.  And while Fiat Currency does work in short term, it DEPENDS on other's willingness to accept it as tender.  Tally sticks (look it up) are an even better example of a Currency that has SOMETHING (whether it be gold or piss) that is used to verify its value.  As the Federal Reserve moves to introduce our new monopoly style money, I discovered that it actually costs more to print the money than it's worth.  Bitcoin avoids this by not printing anything and keeping it digital.  It's just the man-at-the-top styled schemes that I would worry about aside from Nuclear War, Government Intrusion, or Natural Disasters.  That's why the term "bubble" came to mind.  Thanks for your insight.

Judging by the kind responses I received in such a short time, I believe I know EXACTLY what bitcoin is backed by, and its full intent.  I hope the people behind this "wonderful idea" are as trustworthy as they currently appear to be.

Everybody loves a smartass from time to time.... 2 Points for style.

Or a Convention Center for assholes.  Ask a simple question, that is TOTALLY VALID, considering that an EMP sends everybody home broke...  that's what I was wondering.  Also, there was an Asian version of bitcoin that got hacked and so that was the other reason I was asking.  IF I HAD TYPED THE ENTIRE GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING MESSAGE LIKE THIS, I COULD UNDERSTAND WHY MOST OF YOU GOT BUTT-HURT, over a simple question.

Hey james.... I'm going to use a word right now that I'm sure you understand completely:  Cocksucker.  I believe that you are a cocksucker because no matter how smart you THINK you are or how HARD you try to make others feel inadequate, you still have a cock in your mouth.  Leave it to a cocksucker to try and tell someone how to talk, WHILE they have a cock in their mouth.  P.S.  Talking with your mouth full is rude, you cocksucker.
