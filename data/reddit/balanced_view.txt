Can anyone suggest a guide for accepting Bitcoin for a small business in UK?
The 10 min confirmation period sounds pretty restrictive.. But I'd still like to try it in principle.

I was pretty sure this was something to do with Trent Reznor to begin with.. stupid brain.

This also has absolutely nothing to do with security or FBI raids.
"Open" marketplaces will always attract shills, but consumers and honest traders will generally band together to help each other out.

Yeah but did you DCA?

Where is my money? It's been well over a week since I was told it would be refunded.

That's a good question... I wasn't totally au fait with their "non-standard" fees, and was more concerned with getting a reply from Bitstamp / the money back.
I can see in their Fee Schedule page the amount I was charged amounts to the total of their fees listed for this type of transaction (although I had no idea any of this was likely to happen to me). They break it down to 0.25 + 35 + 35 + 50 USD. Actually I think I paid slightly more, but I'd have to redo the math. Therefore I think there's zero chance I could contest the fee – even if I could have dialogue with them, and it looks like they are blocking my communications or doing a good job of ignoring me.
As for why – really I can't think of anything, as they were so vague. I have had trouble with my bank within the last 2 years relating to a fraud investigation (this was settled as it was essentially a mistake)... Purely the bank, nothing police/gov related. That could have caused some kind of red flag, but given the opportunity I could have assured Bitstamp as to the nature of the problem.
Other than that I guess I could have transferred btc to someone doing something dodgy. Which is interesting... I don't know enough about btc in terms of being able to prove ownership of any wallets in question. What I do know is that no transfers ever went out of my Bitstamp wallet directly to any dodgy entity.. if they claimed this I would say I never knowingly did anything like that, but obviously that would be my word vs theirs.

Sorry I wasn't very clear. I have held my account for several years, deposited fiat many times and bought bitcoin many times over those years.
I recently decided to move all btc somewhere else, before this trouble, boy am I glad I did.
So I have a reasonable bit of history they could have dug through. However I have never, until now, had any kind of problem with my account. No warnings or questions asked.

It is probably this, however I can't be sure of the exact situation.


I don't even disagree with their decision. For all I know someone I transferred coins to could have done something iffy with them. But in here lies the problem... Correct me as I'm no expert, but there is no way for someone to tell whether a wallet you transfer to is owned by the same person or someone else. I mean you could both conceivably be on the same network and therefore it appear to be one person?
If I'm right about the above then it seems to just be guilt by association.
It's a bit like having a bank account closed because you gave some money to someone with a criminal record.
I can understand why the exchanges are twitchy, but given they leave no room for dialogue or warnings it seems overly heavy handed when there is a good potential for mistakes to be made by the investigator.
Really it's just how they deal with it that seems totally wrong to me. Absolute radio silence and very slow in processing my case.
And to be charged what essentially is a fine is just the icing on the cake. I can quite happily agree to take my business elsewhere, but given that they haven't provided me with a service in this occasion I don't think it's fair for then to charge.

Why is it safer to use US exchanges?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:34:10
4... Not that big but I sure want my money back asap

Why is it safer to use a US exchange?
Bitstamp are registered in the UK meaning they are under the jurisdiction of Trading Standards.

Got the deposit back today. Minus nearly $250 fee
Still haven't had a single reply to any of my messages
So a great big fat warning for everyone... I still have no idea what caused this but it has been a few of the most stressful weeks of my life.
I held Bitstamp with high regard in terms of customer service. But not any more. They will turn on you in the blink of an eye, and the experience is well worth avoiding.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:37:01
Thanks. I have no idea what can have happened. What is more annoying is that Bitstamp support have not responded to a single message.
@_date: 2017-06-13 09:03:49
Tell me about it. Just had my Bitstamp account closed mid-deposit. Money yet to be returned, 2 weeks so far!
Zero communications during the entire ordeal. Just unbelievably terrible way to treat people. Obviously no way of me discussing whatever caused the account to be closed – for which there has been no real explanation either.
Anyone able to recommend a better alternative to Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:58:45
I have emailed several days ago. No reply. Tried Twitter too, no reply. Don't especially want to use Facebook for it due to privacy.
I'm actually getting a bit worried now. Since they disabled phone support there's basically no way for me to contact them.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:44:59
Tried to sign up... I just get "invalid request" with no further info about what I did wrong

Just go very careful with them, they can turn on you quickly. 
Best of luck

0 btc, just money as a deposit
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:29:01
Still not had a single official response from Bitstamp about this... Where is my refund? 
Awful company
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:47:27
I'm not in the US and no I've never had to do that before. Presumably they can return a bank transfer without any further information.
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:48:17
Yes, will do. Thanks for your interest!
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:29:06
Thanks. Have done. But no reply so far.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:35:35
Yes! Happy to answer their questions etc. Just want my money back and get on with my life
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:03:29
Nope I did not. AFAIK it is a genuine account but they didn't give me any proof at all. I was just desperate as it was literally the only contact I received.
