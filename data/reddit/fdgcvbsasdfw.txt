Yes, importprivkey expects the private key in WIF.
So, dumpprivkey testnet, convert that testnet WIF to private key, convert private key to mainnet WIF, import that WIF with importprivkey

I believe this is what you want to do:
bitcoin-cli -testnet dumpprivkey moQR7i8XM4rSGoNwEsw3h4YEuduuP6mxw7
where moQR7i8XM4rSGoNwEsw3h4YEuduuP6mxw7 is the testnet address you sent coins to
it will give you the private key, in WIF format, something like this:
then I think you need to convert this from testnet WIF to private key.  follow the WIF to private key section in the following link:
then you would convert that private key to mainnet WIF, following the instructions in that section of the previous link.
finally, you would import the private key in WIF
bitcoin-cli importprivkey PRIVATE_KEY "test label" true
Be wary of using websites to do the conversions for you, they could take your private key.  I think you can do the conversions using python-bitcoinlib:
Let us know if you get it figured out or need more help.

No, they are not necessarily lost.  If you can determine the public/private keypair in the testnet wallet you can convert that into the bitcoin (non-testnet) equivalent.  You'd need to export the private key from the testnet wallet and import that into bitcoin core.
Be vary wary of anybody coming forward to help you out doing this as you could pretty easily accidentally divulge the private key and they could then run off with your btc. Be mindful. (And be careful while figuring this out, dont accidentally delete the testnet wallet private key)

It's easy to get a private key.  It is just a really long number.  Take a look here for an example of using dice to create a random private key.
Once you have the private key you need to calculate the public key from it, and I don't think that is practical without a computer.  See here for an example of someone explaining it: 
I don't think it's a bad idea to manually generate your own cold storage key.  Though using a hardware wallet like the trezor or ledger nano s is a much better option all around.

Is the source code available for the device (and not just the apps sitting atop it)?  Are we able to do a deterministic build?  Is it open hardware?
