People will never learn. But they will suffer the actual losses. Long range bitcoins are moving from less competent to the more competent over time. Sign of self repairing system.

I agree. I think people will vote inside blockchain based systems but also between systems by simply holding or selling the tokens. DASH is actually implementing this governance model where master-nodes (stake holders) vote on funding projects on chain by allocating a % of the newly generated coins.

It would not be controversial if it's a demand from a majority of users. Sure it might drop in value. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 23:50:14
Imagine a voting system in a blockchain system to allocate a portion of the newly minted coins (instead of 100% to miners) to different projects to improve the system as a whole and protect the users rights. 
If the system gains enough economic power it could establish a physical presence somewhere in the world and create a nation state with everything that entails. Including a military and a court system.

That would be like saying email or tcp/ip does not create any new value. It does. Because it's more efficient than the alternative and it's voluntary to use.

I think it's more a hatred towards the idea of finance and big business in itself. A hatred towards self-interest, success and strength. Bitcoin/crypto finance is going to get this kind hatred also. 
The reason is that the mainstream moral code is altruism (self-sacrifice). This fosters a hatred towards anyone strong and successful.

Yes. The problem is the government. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:27:25
Wall street is not the problem. They did not ask for a bail-out. Wall street is the brain of production. The government created perverse incentives by removing risk from loans and controlling the rating agencies. Government is the problem, not wall street.

"The meaning ascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merely wrong: it represents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which is responsible, more than any other single factor, for the arrested moral development of mankind.
In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image it conjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achieve his own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but the gratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment.
Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” is: concern with one’s own interests.
This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us whether concern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us what constitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer such questions."

@_date: 2015-12-24 21:58:35
I don't give anything for appealing to authority. I only accept arguments. Are you saying it is impossible to create a demand for the bitcoin token without increasing blocksize? Parallel transaction systems can be implemented and requere the bitcoin token to work. This would offer a utility in the form of cheap transactions and at the same time create a demand without need to increase the blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:40:34
That is about a 50% reduction in supply. Surly that will impact the market somehow if demand stays constant or increases slightly.

Centralized or not... No miner with a stake in equipment has any incentive to hurt the bitcoin system to the detriment of the users. If any miner decides to change the bitcoin system in a way that causes it to be less useful for users they will experience a price fall and their own investment in mining equipment will be devalued. 
The mining incentives are just right. No rational miner will cut his own branch.
If a government forces a miner into filtering transactions bitcoin is subjected to competition from over 1000 alt-coins. This competition is the reason why it is impractical for governments to subdue cryptocurrency by regulation.

So you think that money is the root of all evil? . . . Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?
When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil?
Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.
But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced. -A.R.

"Since the proper services of a government—the police, the armed forces, the law courts—are demonstrably needed by individual citizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would (and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.
The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary government financing—how to determine the best means of applying it in practice—is a very complex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task of political philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and to demonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method of implementation is more than premature today—since the principle will be practicable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has been constitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions." -Ayn Rand

Bitcoin does not scale linearly. This means that the fee/cost pr transaction will become somewhat expensive so there is plenty of room for parallel payment systems that compete on price and functions.

No. Thats is a common misconception. The core foundation is an open protocol with a free market for mining.

In a free society, the “rights” of any group are derived from the rights of its members through their voluntary, individual choice and contractual agreement, and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specific undertaking. Every legitimate group undertaking is based on the participants’ right of free association and free trade. (By “legitimate,” I mean: noncriminal and freely formed, that is, a group which no one was forced to join.)
For instance, the right of an industrial concern to engage in business is derived from the right of its owners to invest their money in a productive venture—from their right to hire employees—from the right of the employees to sell their services—from the right of all those involved to produce and to sell their products—from the right of the customers to buy (or not to buy) those products. Every link of this complex chain of contractual relationships rests on individual rights, individual choices, individual agreements. Every agreement is delimited, specified and subject to certain conditions, that is, dependent upon a mutual trade to mutual benefit.½

Instead of a 50% pool we will simply see a 50% solo miner.

There are always cost advantages to scaling up so we will sooner or later see a 50+% solo miner in ethereum. They will probably pay a nice dividend to the shareholders of this solo-"pool"/company.
You hold this idea that human nature is evil. It is this premise that drives the irrational fear of a 51% attack from a miner who is actually making a living mining on this network.

Yes. To be rationally selfish is a virtue and will foster win-win relationships between the miners and the users of the network. 
You probably view a person who is rationally selfish as immoral. And a person who is altruistic as moral. To sacrifice yourself for others is actually self-destructive and therefore immoral.
To be rationally selfish does not imply sacrificing others for yourself,  but to create long-term win-win relationships by providing a value.

If you want to use the bitcoin transactions services and large network to transfer ownership of values in the global ledger you need to buy some bitcoins. This creates a demand for bitcoin and the prices goes up because of the limited supply.
If you want to speculate on the price going up you need to buy some more bitcoins this creates a demand for bitcoins and the price goes up.
The bitcoins have no intrinsic value. Only the services and security the Bitcoin network offers this is what creates the demand for the bitcoins you need to use the services.
If the bitcoin network is no longer usefull for transactions because there is something better on the market the bitcoins will also loose their value over time.

The "decentralisation" mantra is misplaced. The real key word should be free market.
We will have "decentralisation" in terms of competing coins/payment networks. But we will see centralisation in the coins themselves.
Having one company/team that sets the direction of a coin is actually desirable because they profit from keeping it competitive while competing with the other coins on the market. This competition between coins will make all the coins stronger against attacks.
tl;dr. As long as there is a free market for money, "centralisation" of the individual payment networks is no problem at all because of the competition between coins.

A mixed economy is rule by pressure groups. It is an amoral, institutionalized civil war of special interests and lobbies, all fighting to seize a momentary control of the legislative machinery, to extort some special privilege at one another’s expense by an act of government—i.e., by force. In the absence of individual rights, in the absence of any moral or legal principles, a mixed economy’s only hope to preserve its precarious semblance of order, to restrain the savage, desperately rapacious groups it itself has created, and to prevent the legalized plunder from running over into plain, unlegalized looting of all by all—is compromise; compromise on everything and in every realm—material, spiritual, intellectual—so that no group would step over the line by demanding too much and topple the whole rotted structure. If the game is to continue, nothing can be permitted to remain firm, solid, absolute, untouchable; everything (and everyone) has to be fluid, flexible, indeterminate, approximate. By what standard are anyone’s actions to be guided? By the expediency of any immediate moment.
The only danger, to a mixed economy, is any not-to-be-compromised value, virtue, or idea. The only threat is any uncompromising person, group, or movement. The only enemy is integrity.

True. Rights are sadly often violated. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:34:21


No. It assumes your own life as the standard of the good and your own happiness to be your highest purpose. If you outcompete a person/company and indirectly "damage" that person by virtue of pursuing your rational self-interest without directly violating their rights that is moral and good. If you steal, cheat or hurt others you are making yourself dependent on others(the people you steal from) to create the values you need to sustain your own life and that knowledge will damage your self-esteem and ultimately prevent you from being happy. That is why it is not rationally selfish to lie, steal and cheat.
It is your own life that is the highest value. All your values presuppose your life. It is your life that makes the concepts of value, good and evil possible. That which furthers your own life, values and happiness is the good. 
It seems to me that you hold society as a whole as the standard of the good not your own life.

Stealing or cheating does not scale in a civilisation and is therefore fundamentally not in accordance with the requirements for life. Cooperation and symbiosis scales.

The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; that purpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated market will inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means of free trade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by government intervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises or subsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, by legislative action.
A “coercive monopoly” is a business concern that can set its prices and production policies independent of the market, with immunity from competition, from the law of supply and demand. An economy dominated by such monopolies would be rigid and stagnant.
The necessary precondition of a coercive monopoly is closed entry—the barring of all competing producers from a given field. This can be accomplished only by an act of government intervention, in the form of special regulations, subsidies, or franchises. Without government assistance, it is impossible for a would-be monopolist to set and maintain his prices and production policies independent of the rest of the economy. For if he attempted to set his prices and production at a level that would yield profits to new entrants significantly above those available in other fields, competitors would be sure to invade his industry.

The "decentralisation" mantra is misplaced. The real key word should be free market.
We will have "decentralisation" in terms of competing coins/payment networks. But we will see centralisation in the coins themselves.
Having one company/team that sets the direction of a coin is actually desirable because they profit from keeping it competitive while competing with the other coins on the market. This competition between coins will make all the coins stronger against attacks.
tl;dr. As long as there is a free market for money, "centralisation" of the individual payment networks is no problem at all.

Bitcoin is entering the full on merchant adoption phase. You can see this in the success of bitpay and coinbase numbers. This will create a full on selling pressure of bitcoins because there is no way for the merchants to restock without selling the bitcoins they receive as payment. This is a phenomenon that might last a while until the supply chain starts to use bitcoin.
The price will fall to a level where new buyers balance out this selling pressure. Or we might see a new hype cycle.

To the extent you have an option to "fall prey" vs actting rationally you can always choose the rational option. 100% of the time. (within your own context of knowledge)
Where there is no alternatives you have no options anyway. To be rational is to choose right when you have alternatives and within your own context of knowledge.

If you think a 51% pool will kill bitcoin you should start looking for alternatives now because that is going to happen and you can't even know if it already has happened. I don't see that as a problem. Because the incentives are aligned correct. Decentralised vs centralised is not the issue. The key issue for bitcoin is that mining is a free market open for competition. This in turn will keep the fees competitive.
The pool serves as a service provider profiting from offering a valuable product.

@_date: 2014-04-16 20:02:45
yes. 
The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law. But a government that initiates the employment of force against men who had forced no one, the employment of armed compulsion against disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilate morality: such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from the role of protector to the role of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role of policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of self-defense. Such a government substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct: you may do whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than his.

My point was made in the context of free market mining. Of Course the nature of something like restaurants requires global distribution to serve the customers, hiring massive amounts of people and therefore is very difficult to get 50% market share even if the market was free (it's not). 
The nature of crypto-mining is such that scaling is easy. It just requires a datacenter.
My main point is that time/energy is wasted trying to think of ways to prevent larger miners. As long as there is a free market with competition between different crypto-coins having a large miner in anyone coin is not a problem. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:28:37

It's derived from utility combined with a limited amount of tokens to gain access. 
The people who mine secure the network. That is utility. The people who exploit the utility push up the demand for tokens and thereby gives it value. 
So it's a collaboration. Both add value.

Just a comment to your use of the concept humility.
"humility" is best translated into moral unambitiousness. Meaning: I don't think I am any good and don't expect me to execute on my moral ideal.
You are looking for the virtue of pride witch best translates into moral ambitiousness. A desire and conviction to execute on ones moral ideals.
"Self-abasement is the antithesis of morality. If a man has acted immorally, but regrets it and wants to atone for it, it is not self-abasement that prompts him, but some remnant of love for moral values—and it is not self-abasement that he expresses, but a longing to regain his self-esteem. Humility is not a recognition of one’s failings, but a rejection of morality. “I am no good” is a statement that may be uttered only in the past tense. To say: “I am no good” is to declare: “—and I never intend to be any better.”" -A.R.

You assume a benevolent government. 
To the extent you raise the block size you will increase the HW requirements and BW requirements. You can get to a point where only a few data centers would be able to handle the load.

People sometimes act stupid. You are free to try and help them voluntarily but don't use the government. It is immoral. 
The word “pollution” implies health hazards, such as smog or dirty waters.
"if a man creates a physical danger or harm to others, which extends beyond the line of his own property, such as unsanitary conditions or even loud noise, and if this is proved, the law can and does hold him responsible. If the condition is collective, such as in an overcrowded city, appropriate and objective laws can be defined, protecting the rights of all those involved—as was done in the case of oil rights, air-space rights, etc. But such laws cannot demand the impossible, must not be aimed at a single scapegoat, i.e., the industrialists, and must take into consideration the whole context of the problem, i.e., the absolute necessity of the continued existence of industry—if the preservation of human life is the standard."
In short the solution is to apply private property to all land and water and protection of rights.

I don't mind that mining is somewhat centralized as long as it is open to competition. We know we have an out if they don't behave. Let's not vilify the miners unless they do something bad. I don't think they will. Miners have all the incentives to do good for bitcoin. And big miners are better at fight off coercive governments and investing in new better systems to improve bitcoin.

Speculation is not a problem in itself. But when government control the nature and the funds of the speculation it can create a systemic risk for the network. Let's say 90% of trading is done in government regulated markets then any slight government rule change can cause great fluctuations in price. Also a major theft is a real and greater risk when assets are concentrated in big govevrnment regulated siloes.

We have stake holders who want product A (scale) as first priority and some product B (censorship resistant). It is difficult to optimize for both A and B at the same time.

They miss the main point that you can scale bitcoin in different ways. Big blocks being the most primitive and short sighted way.

current market price minus a liquidation discount ; this incentives an ecosystem of arbitrageurs to
quickly step in to reduce the borrower’s exposure, and eliminate the protocol’s risk.


repaid, and ranges from 0 to 1, such as 25%. The liquidation process may continue to be called until
the user’s borrowing is less than their borrowing capacity.


exchanging their asset for the borrower’s cToken collateral. As both users, both assets, and prices
are all contained within the Compound protocol, liquidation is frictionless and does not rely on any
outside systems or order-books.

My prediction is that hobby nodes will be replaced by more commercial nodes. But I think it will tend towards fewer full nodes that will offer API interfaces to people that need it. Because this is a cheaper solution then running your own node.

You have a simple and primitive understanding of what honesty is. Honesty is not about revealing your private state of mind to anyone who asks. 
"The mark of an honest man . . . is that he means what he says and knows what he means."
"Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud—that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions, while their intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and flee—that you do not care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling—that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others." -A.R.

Actually you are the one who misunderstands the term. Counterparty risk is when a 3 party holds your assets or controls the transfer of this asset like your private keys. Its not about how the asset might be traded and in what forms. That is related to price manipulation risk.

Says a lot about your character if you think that. Here is one of my favorite quotes about lying: 
"People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I’ve learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one’s reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one’s master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person’s view requires to be faked. And if one gains the immediate purpose of the lie – the price one pays is the destruction of that which the gain was intended to serve. The man who lies to the world, is the world’s slave from then on." - Ayn Rand

Maybe the number of fees but probably not the final value of the fees. 
If successful lightning will entrench bitcoin as the backbone of value transfers on a large scale. It will make bitcoin more competitive against other coins and increase the valuable of the tokens in general. 
If it was possible to scale bitcoin without the lightning network this approach does limit the number of transaction and therefore the number of fees. But not necessarily the value of the fees. So it is in the miners self interest to promote this system.

A "normal" western person does not really have a huge incentive to use bitcoin on a regular basis. It is for people who for some reason are rejected by the normal banking system or want to be anonymous who have an incentive. 
One good reason for a "normal" person to buy bitcoins now could be as an investment. But that is only if you think bitcoin is going to increase in value. 
More and more services start to accept or requere bitcoins. Eventually it will be cheaper and more convenient to use bitcoins rather then conventional money.

It is true that the numeric value of the goods he has on the shelfs decreases. That is not a problem because when he wants to stock up on new goods again the price for new goods is much smaller.

Hording it not a problem. Because: Hording only translates into deflation as long as more and more people are buying bitcoins. This will eventually slow down because the prices of bitcoins gets very high. Eventually "horders" will need to buy goods and services so they will also start spending bitcoins. This will cause deflation to be dramatically reduced and the "Horder" will get a better return on his money if he invests them in production of goods and services.

You are wrong. Early adopters do not have an unfair advantage. The fact they see the "light" and take on the work and risk is rewarded fairly with the increase in bitcoin value.
No one is forced to invest in or start using bitcoin. If it has a large value who cares? Only invest in bitcoin if you think it is in your own rational self interest.
Early adopters are rewarded for making this happen. If it was not for them bitcoin would never be worth anything. Also early adopters are likely to invest some of their newfound welth in the bitcoin infrastructure to grow bitcoin even more.

No. The end is not the gold.
I guess you can expand "backed" to mean: "tied with a 1on1 ratio to a physical commodity". But if you can not trade your "backup" gold to anything of value to you. then it really has no value to be backed by gold other then perventing inflation.
To be "backed" by whatever you can buy for the currency is much better then beeing backed by a random metal as long as you can not inflate the currency. Bitcoin solves the inflation problem so there is no need to be "backed" or tied to a single commodity.

Primacy of Existence vs. Primacy of Consciousness
"The basic metaphysical issue that lies at the root of any system of philosophy [is] the primacy of existence or the primacy of consciousness.
The primacy of existence (of reality) is the axiom that existence exists, i.e., that the universe exists independent of consciousness (of any consciousness), that things are what they are, that they possess a specific nature, an identity. The epistemological corollary is the axiom that consciousness is the faculty of perceiving that which exists—and that man gains knowledge of reality by looking outward. The rejection of these axioms represents a reversal: the primacy of consciousness—the notion that the universe has no independent existence, that it is the product of a consciousness (either human or divine or both). The epistemological corollary is the notion that man gains knowledge of reality by looking inward (either at his own consciousness or at the revelations it receives from another, superior consciousness).
The source of this reversal is the inability or unwillingness fully to grasp the difference between one’s inner state and the outer world, i.e., between the perceiver and the perceived (thus blending consciousness and existence into one indeterminate package-deal). This crucial distinction is not given to man automatically; it has to be learned. It is implicit in any awareness, but it has to be grasped conceptually and held as an absolute." -A.R.

Main feature any cryptocoin needs it so store value. If there is a selling pressure from miners you will burn value using electricity this will limit the price gains or even result in massive value drop. 
Any coin that has 0% inflation and solves the security issues in a different way have a competitive advantage to bitcoin.

You hold sacrifice as a moral ideal. That's called altruism. 
Altruism is about giving up your values for others or whatever. 
When you spend your time working that is about creating value for your life. When you then give that money to people you don't know that is a real sacrifice. 
If you helped a person you know and understand truly deserves help that would be different and not necessarily a sacrifice.

Ludwig von Mises was clearly wrong. The utility bitcoin offers as a cheap, efficient and secure accounting system is what gives bitcoin its value as money.

Hash rate movement is determined by 4 factors. by price of electricity, bitcoin, technology advances and bitcoin production. 
Hash rate can go up dispite of any other 3 factors pushing it down.
So you can not conclude anything about coin production rate problems by looking at hash rate. 
The fact is that price have been falling for one year. That is mainlyt caused by miners selling huge quantity of bitcoins to pay for electricity and hardware.
The selling pressure will always match the inflation rate.

Value comes from utility something offers individuals for the purpose of living. We all know money serves the purpose of keeping account in a social context.

You are asking where rights come from. 
"A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life means the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.)
The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom of action. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference by other men.
Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive—of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on them except of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.
The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.
Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values."

You study the system in detail and look at the broad range of factors that gives bitcoin value to some and what alternative/competitors exist. The tech, the people involved, the utility and so on.  
I mainly see bitcoin as money and a payment system so I first compare it with what we use now. In that light, I see bitcoin as low risk because it is Objectively better than fiat money on a broad range of factors and the tech is solid. Risk of failure comes from the possibility that a much better alternative replace bitcoin. But that would be a long range risk. There are many more factors.

* Very positive effect
* The community og users. But most of all the protocol of bitcoin.
* Supply and demand. Bitcoins are generated at a slow rate slowing down untill no more bitcoins are created. Demand is growing fast making the price go up. Emotions make the price fluctuate for no good reason.
* I see Bitcoin as the worlds main currency. Because no one can regulate the transactions or inflate the money supply.
* It is already legit. The people who stad to benefit from using it. Mostly online merchants.
* You should research and deside yourself. Breaking the governments monopoly on money would be good for everybody long term. You could stand to earn on increased value of bitcoin.

Imagine every individual human hording bitcoins and only buying more bitcoins. Never selling/trading any bitcoins away. That is impossible.

Inflation is an increase in the money supply. If adoption does not match this inflation we will see price drops. There is no reason why bitcoin should have a ~10% increase in currency supply at this moment in time. Or about ~5% after the next halving.

The miner that mines a block should be able to choose his own block size within limits:
* Max new size limited to: ( previous_block_size * 1.1 )
* Min new size limited to: ( previous_block_size / 1.1 )
* Min Hard limit 1 MB
* Max Hard (Not sure we need max hard limit. No miners would increase it to unrealistic levels )
If most miners choose to double the size more transactions can be processed. 
If most miners keep a small block size, fees will have to go up to incentivise the miners to increase the block size.
The miners have an incentive to keep the block size to a realistic size to keep the network working and also earn as much as possible by processing as many transactions as possible.
Size attack. No attacker can generate enough blocks in succesion requered to increase or decrese the blocksize to an unrealistic level.
This solution will let the market deside the best block size.

Picture a band of strangers marching down Main Street, submachine guns at the ready. When confronted by the police, the leader of the band announces: "Me and the boys are only here to see that justice is done, so you have no right to interfere with us." According to the "libertarian" anarchists, in such a confrontation the police are morally bound to withdraw, on pain of betraying the rights of self-defense and free trade.
"Anarcho-capitalism" is a contradiction in terms. Capitalism can exist only where rights are protected, including property rights. To protect rights, criminals who initiate force must be met with retaliatory force. But the wielding of retaliatory force itself must be placed under objective control, by a constitutionally limited government with objective law. Otherwise, what results is not "competing defense agencies" but civil war. That war will be won by the gang with the most ruthless and most powerful army. Under anarchy, might, not right, determines what the "laws" will be.
In terms of current events, anarchism means Lebanon or Somalia. To link such horrors with the benevolence and prosperity of capitalism is obscene.

Yes. Here is a quote for you:
"The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judges what is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’s survival qua man.
Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it is the evil." - Ayn Rand

objective means independent of consciousness. so the essense is laws based on facts of reality.
An objective law protects a country’s freedom; only a non-objective law can give a statist the chance he seeks: a chance to impose his arbitrary will—his policies, his decisions, his interpretations, his enforcement, his punishment or favor—on disarmed, defenseless victims.
The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to establish that a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as well as objective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men who attempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a society left the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it would degenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody private feuds or vendettas.
If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an institution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective code of rules.

A solution to this is more control/choice to users over who processes his transaction and gets the fee payment.

This would quickly cut the bad miners out of the "loop"

I think miners who run the full nodes and has the job of downloading and store the complete blockchain should deside the blocksize using the proof-of-work mechanism.

Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims. Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge. Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy—a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of using your mind’s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving values that are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.
Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort, so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others, but earn it by my own achievement. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the lives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my desires—so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men, men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another with a cannibal’s lust, men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them.

So you define "intrinsic value" to mean something that has multiple uses.
I totally disagree. I don't think you understand the concept of value. 
A value is that witch one acts to gain and or keep. If a value only has one real world use case it still has intrinsic value.
The oppesite to intrinsic value would be subjective value. It only holds a value to the "irrational" mind of the subject.

Anarchism is a product of and expression of collectivism.
"Anarcho-capitalists" fail to see the pacifist implications of their position because they think in terms of groups instead of individuals. They think in terms of "defense agencies," and picture many "competing" (i.e., conflicting) agencies. These anarchists could not avoid the pacifist implications of their positions if they realized that both a government and a "defense agency" is just a group of individuals. When reduced to the level of individual-to-individual interactions, it becomes clear that "not imposing morality by force" means no individual can use force to defend himself—as in my example of not shooting back at someone who starts shooting at you.
If we abandon the collectivized mindset, we see that anarchism would mean any individual can "take the law into his own hands." But when he uses what he feels to be retaliatory, and thus morally justified, force, he is taking exactly the same action to which anarchists object when taken by a government: attempting to forcibly exclude the "competing" use of force by the initiator of force (e.g., the gunman). If it is morally proper for an individual to defend himself by force, it is morally proper for him to band together with others to do so—i.e., to form a government.

"Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law." Regulation is coercion. So not freedom. Bitcoin is without coercion.

@_date: 2013-04-06 19:46:58
No. not arbitrary. It is objectivism.
My philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:
* Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.
* Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.
* Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.
* The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’s rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.

@_date: 2013-05-22 08:32:12
It would need a constant flow of money into Bitcoin equel to the flow out.
if the value of a Bitcoin is $100K and we have X% flow out you would need a $ flow into Bitcoin of. 
X = 1% out: 
25 BTC * 365days * 24h * 6(blocks pr hour) * 1%(flow to $) * $100K = $1.3 Billion into bitcoin pr. year
X = 10% out:
$13 Billion into bitcoin pr. year
lets say each person can put $10K pr year into Bitcoin. then we need  out-flow: 130,000 people buying Bitcoin every year.
If there is no flow out into $ then you would only need to sell one bitcoin for $100K for the price to be $100K pr BTC

@_date: 2013-05-29 22:10:57
Centralisation is not a problem and It will happen eventually. Because of the cost benefits of large scale operations.
Probably one company will do most of the mining of Bitcoin. 
And this company will probably not do anything to take away value from Bitcoin. Because it is in their own rational self interest to keep people using it. Also they will keep the transactions fees low because of potential competition from other coins and miners.

So you think it is leagal to copy a private bitcoin key (pattern) and spend another persons bitcoins?
The fact is that when you copy anotner persons data, music, invention, idea without paying for it, it loses value becasue it becomes less scarese.
Bitcoin is the ultimative example of this. a single copy to anther person of the secret key makes it completly worthless if the person use that key to move the coins.

* Market hosting nodes: offers hosting space for a price and the owner of this node can "police" the items for sale. Some hosts might want to specialise in some category of goods and exclude other goods. 
* Market trackers: Scan hosting nodes and lists all items for sale and presents them to the shoppers for sale.
* Merchant client: Offers a market overview of where to market/sell items. The merchant can upload items for sale and buy hosting contracts on the network.
* Hosting contracts: Contracts that merchants make with hosting nodes about what goods they offer, can-offer, the price and duration for hosting the advertisement for the goods.

It would go up :) I see it as a good thing if the size can grow quckly to accomedate for increased load.
But a miner would not grow the size if his bandwith could not follow. If the size gets close to his physical limits (hard drive, cpu power or bandwith) he will decrease size. Also if there is not enough money to be earned on extra fees.
Only if a majority of miners pulls up will the size increase over time. The slow small  miners will be left behind. And that is a good thing for the network.

I have to disagree. The idea of anarchistm is very dangerous.
"Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: . . . a society without an organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of objective laws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government." --Ayn Rand

@_date: 2013-05-17 22:57:03
Haha. that is not axioms :)
An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.
First axiom of objectivism:
Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.
If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.
Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and consciousness—are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it exists and that you know it.
To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes. Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—the greatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped the meaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.

So you think that money is the root of all evil? . . . Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?
When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil?
Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.
But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced. -Ayn Rand

"Anarcho-capitalism" is a contradiction in terms. Capitalism can exist only where rights are protected, including property rights. To protect rights, criminals who initiate force must be met with retaliatory force. But the wielding of retaliatory force itself must be placed under objective control, by a constitutionally limited government with objective law. Otherwise, what results is not "competing defense agencies" but civil war. That war will be won by the gang with the most ruthless and most powerful army. Under anarchy, might, not right, determines what the "laws" will be.
In terms of current events, anarchism means Lebanon or Somalia. To link such horrors with the benevolence and prosperity of capitalism is obscene.

Because something is the law does not make it right. Example: "In some countries it is illegal to voice you opinion about the state or the church" Is that childish to oppose?
In a fully free society, taxation—or, to be exact, payment for governmental services—would be voluntary. Since the proper services of a government—the police, the armed forces, the law courts—are demonstrably needed by individual citizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would (and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.
The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary government financing—how to determine the best means of applying it in practice—is a very complex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task of political philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and to demonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method of implementation is more than premature today—since the principle will be practicable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has been constitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions.

I don't agree. When 2 values are exchanged ideally both people involved in the trade have a larger value after the trade. This can happen because both people value the value they get more then the value they lost.
They both objectively have a larger value at the end of the trade because the new value they got is more usefull to them both. The total size of the value "pie" is larger.

Very simple. There is a hard limit on transactions in one block.

Fear of centralisation is not rational and very emotional.
A free market has never created a coercive monopoly. State regulation is always to blame if a company starts to act against the users interests over the long term. (I challenge you to find an example where the state is not involved in some way)
Centralisation of Bitcoin or any other crypto currency is not a problem as long as there is a pressure from potential competition. This pressure from potential competition keeps the central actor from doing something stupid with the code or set high-fees that will scare the users away. A "monopoly" actually wants users to like and use Bitcoin over alternatives like fiat and other cryptos. Because they only profit from a win-win relationship.
Users can quickly move in and out of different money systems if the code changes to something they don't like. The free market will make sure of this as long as the state does not grant the monopoly the power of force.
Bitcoin controlled by a single miner or pool is likely to happen because pooling resources reduses overhead costs. And that is no problem at all as long as the market is free to compete.
The only enemy of Bitcoin is force from governments. A free market will make sure it stays a win-win for "miners" and users. Even with a 50+% player.

Listen. Bitcoin will not stay decentrilised. A big company is going to control most of the hashing power in the future. That is because of the cost advantages of centralisation.
Thats not a problem. It's in their own rational self interest to do whats best for Bitcoin. If they don't, people will not follow the forks they make. Users will follow only the forks best for them. 
The users have total power to choose a specific fork even if a company have 99% hashing power.
We can compare it with google search. Google have most of the searching "power", but the users have total control/freedom to go somewhere else to search. Same with Bitcoin...

you are wrong! all property is in essence a product of your mind. copying IP without permision is stealing.
What the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind’s contribution in its purest form: the origination of an idea. The subject of patents and copyrights is intellectual property.
An idea as such cannot be protected until it has been given a material form. An invention has to be embodied in a physical model before it can be patented; a story has to be written or printed. But what the patent or copyright protects is not the physical object as such, but the idea which it embodies. By forbidding an unauthorized reproduction of the object, the law declares, in effect, that the physical labor of copying is not the source of the object’s value, that that value is created by the originator of the idea and may not be used without his consent; thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought into existence. 
It is important to note, in this connection, that a discovery cannot be patented, only an invention. A scientific or philosophical discovery, which identifies a law of nature, a principle or a fact of reality not previously known, cannot be the exclusive property of the discoverer because: (a) he did not create it, and (b) if he cares to make his discovery public, claiming it to be true, he cannot demand that men continue to pursue or practice falsehoods except by his permission. He can copyright the book in which he presents his discovery and he can demand that his authorship of the discovery be acknowledged, that no other man appropriate or plagiarize the credit for it—but he cannot copyright theoretical knowledge. Patents and copyrights pertain only to the practical application of knowledge, to the creation of a specific object which did not exist in nature—an object which, in the case of patents, may never have existed without its particular originator; and in the case of copyrights, would never have existed.
The government does not “grant” a patent or copyright, in the sense of a gift, privilege, or favor; the government merely secures it—i.e., the government certifies the origination of an idea and protects its owner’s exclusive right of use and disposal.

Miners choose the transactions they include in a block.
If they dont find your fee large enough to pay for their work they just don't include your transaction.
So the network grows with the fees users pay.

Problem with e-gold and other gold backed digital currencies are that they can be shut down by government. Backed by something means counterparty risk. Bitcoin has no counterparty risk. And governments can not close the company because there is no company.
There is no such thing as "intrinsic value". 
“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible.
In a digital age we value digital money for transferring welth. Gold is not practical.  Bitcoin solves the problems of inflation by limiting the amount. 
People are trying to create alt-coins all the time. But only the best will be used. just like languages the network effect will prevent total dilution of value and select a few winners in the alt-coin race.

As new people arrive prices will go up and the newbies will only be able to buy a smaller amount of bitcoins on average.
therefore the effect of newbies in the future will be smaller then emotional people that got into Bitcoin early and have a large stake.
its true there will be some effect and this will only go away when addoption slows down

You just don't get it. Not spending your bitcoins into the system makes everyone else who is investing/trading bitcoin worth more. It is just like if you put gold into a hole and never spend it. Then All the other gold is worth more. Only when you start pumping it onto the market it affects the prices of everything relative to gold.
The whole bitcoin economy could actually run on only a few bitcoins. They would just be worth alot. The amount in circulation and demand is what sets the price. So hording bitcoins is actuall investing in the whole bitcoin economy. Everyone spending &amp; investing bitcoins benefits from horders in the form of higher value.

"Take the bankers and jail them" why?
When you deposit money into a bank for profit, "safe"-keeping or invest in the bank for profit you take on a risk. If the bank crashes and you loose money that is your own problem. That is how banks should work.
it is the banks job to take on a calculated risk to earn money for the depositors and stock holders.

"“Productive work” does not mean the blind performance of the motions of some job. It means the conscious, rational pursuit of a productive career. In popular usage, the term “career” is applied only to the more ambitious types of work; but, in fact, it applies to all work: it denotes a man’s attitude toward his work.
The difference between a career-man and a job-holder is as follows: a career-man regards his work as constant progress, as a constant upward motion from one achievement to another, higher one, driven by the constant expansion of his mind, his knowledge, his ability, his creative ingenuity, never stopping to stagnate on any level. A job-holder regards his work as a punishment imposed on him by the incomprehensible malevolence of reality or of society, which, somehow, does not let him exist without effort; so his policy is to go through the least amount of motions demanded of him by somebody and to stay put in any job or drift off to another, wherever chance, circumstances or relatives might happen to push him.
In this sense, a man of limited ability who rises by his own purposeful effort from unskilled laborer to shop-foreman, is a career-man in the proper, ethical meaning of the word—while an intelligent man who stagnates in the role of a company president, using one-tenth of his potential ability, is a mere job-holder. And so is a parasite posturing in a job too big for his ability. It is not the degree of a man’s ability that is ethically relevant in this issue, but the full, purposeful use of his ability."

thats like saying an online shop is in no hurry to ship your goods because they have your payment. think long term.

On a compleatly different level it is not in your own rational self interest to aqure/steal values that the creater is not willing to give away for free. you make yourself "dependet" on the work of others. killing your self-asteem. you will never be truly happy as a thief.
If you on the other hand pay up you will give the creator incentives to make more great works and you will feel happy that you did a fair trade.

Money has objective qualities that facilitate savings and trade. This is not an illution. Good money has objective qualities that optimize these functions.
If the objective qualities of the money are not there and the value is based purely on subjectivity/illution the money fail quickly due to the fact that objective-reality dictates what will work longterm. Just like tulip bulbs or fiat money inflated away.
Bitcoin has objective qualities that makes it the best money ever created.

lets say a condition is that the music may not be streamed or played over the radio. And not copyed to others. only for personal use. 
someone had to break the agreement to get it online (eg. thepiratebay) in the first place.
That makes it wrong/force/theft by atleast the first person who violates the conditions.

"Anarcho-capitalists" fail to see the pacifist implications of their position because they think in terms of groups instead of individuals. They think in terms of "defense agencies," and picture many "competing" (i.e., conflicting) agencies. These anarchists could not avoid the pacifist implications of their positions if they realized that both a government and a "defense agency" is just a group of individuals. When reduced to the level of individual-to-individual interactions, it becomes clear that "not imposing morality by force" means no individual can use force to defend himself—as in my example of not shooting back at someone who starts shooting at you.
If we abandon the collectivized mindset, we see that anarchism would mean any individual can "take the law into his own hands." But when he uses what he feels to be retaliatory, and thus morally justified, force, he is taking exactly the same action to which anarchists object when taken by a government: attempting to forcibly exclude the "competing" use of force by the initiator of force (e.g., the gunman). If it is morally proper for an individual to defend himself by force, it is morally proper for him to band together with others to do so—i.e., to form a government.
"Anarcho-capitalism" is a contradiction in terms. Capitalism can exist only where rights are protected, including property rights. To protect rights, criminals who initiate force must be met with retaliatory force. But the wielding of retaliatory force itself must be placed under objective control, by a constitutionally limited government with objective law. Otherwise, what results is not "competing defense agencies" but civil war. That war will be won by the gang with the most ruthless and most powerful army. Under anarchy, might, not right, determines what the "laws" will be.
In terms of current events, anarchism means Lebanon or Somalia. To link such horrors with the benevolence and prosperity of capitalism is obscene.

Rand dealt with the problem by attacking it at the root. According to Rand, the bridge between the "is" and the "ought," between reality and morality, between fact and value is the concept "life." If you choose to live, that instantly implies a whole slew of values, i.e. "oughts." One of those "oughts" would be that you shouldn't ingest poisons, mercury included, because if you do, your life will soon go out of existence.
Coming back to the topic of this question—Rand's statement that every is implies an ought—she really does mean "every." Even boring, trivial facts such as "the sky is blue" imply "oughts." What does "the sky is blue imply"? One implication would be: if look outside during the day and the sky is dark, that means that you ought to take your umbrella if you go out. (Leonard Peikoff discusses this point in the Q&amp;A of his Moral Virtue lectures, from which I take this example.)
The problem with letting the market work here is that if you are in the business of crime you create your own "judge" and "law inforcement" unit and we are back to mob rule.

Altruism is evil.
What is the moral code of altruism? The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.
Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice—which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction—which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. That is not the issue. The issue is whether you do or do not have the right to exist without giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: “No.” Altruism says: “Yes.”

The funny thing is that refunds will not be possible to force upon a company when you pay in Bitcoin directly.

If the terms have been broken by the company the law/police should inforce the chargeback.

Long term decentralization of mining is not possible. Decentralization should not be a goal in itself. Competiotion is good. Competition furthers development.
Avoiding force/coercion should be the main goal. 
The multitude of crypto currencies, P2P structure and the open nature of Bitcoin prevents force. Force is the enemy of reason. Not centralisation.

you would have to build it yourself because the order books are already filled.
And you would have to build it at a faster rate then the companies selling to the bitcoin community. 
that would requere much more money then $1.2M to make that happen.
If you could do this, then long term you would benefit much more from mining then destroying the network. 
Also the code could be changed if the community wants it. making your hardware obsolete.

So you think that money is the root of all evil? . . . Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?
When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil?
Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.
But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced. --Ayn Rand

So you would say it is ok to copy original works of music or books and sell it for a profit if you dont want to create your own?
you remove the posibility for a productive man to prosper from his work.
The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.
Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.

In a fully free society, taxation—or, to be exact, payment for governmental services—would be voluntary. Since the proper services of a government—the police, the armed forces, the law courts—are demonstrably needed by individual citizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would (and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.
The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary government financing—how to determine the best means of applying it in practice—is a very complex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task of political philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and to demonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method of implementation is more than premature today—since the principle will be practicable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has been constitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions.

with ok i mean moral.
why is it agression to copy and sell IP? if not just to copy? That is not self evident. It is agreesion/theft to copy IP without permission in both cases.
you remove the posibility for some men to prosper for their own work (IP). that is amoral and force is involved. you are violating his right to administrate his own works (IP) by force.


The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his own work (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it does not mean that others must provide him with the necessities of life.


Still. All property is in essense a product of the mind. Try creating something without your mind. So IP is just as any other property.
If I sell you a house I can put conditions in the contract preventing you from tearing it down or whatever. that is not force. same with music and books (IP). The creator can sell with conditions attached. that is not force.
to gain IP rights your product should be unique enough to not to violate the rights of free people to use what they have already created and are using.
As an objection to the patent laws, some people cite the fact that two inventors may work independently for years on the same invention, but one will beat the other to the patent office by an hour or a day and will acquire an exclusive monopoly, while the loser’s work will then be totally wasted. This type of objection is based on the error of equating the potential with the actual. The fact that a man might have been first, does not alter the fact that he wasn’t. Since the issue is one of commercial rights, the loser in a case of that kind has to accept the fact that in seeking to trade with others he must face the possibility of a competitor winning the race, which is true of all types of competition.

An analogy would be a lock smith and a theif competing. 
The more advanced the lock is the fewer people are within the special skill it will requere to make an attack on the lock and the more special tools the theif needs to buy/build.
It makes the network stronger against an attack.
The latest move to ASICs excludes all conventional super computers from attacking because they are not dedicated to the problem and is therefore slow compared a network with ASICs
One does not simply attack a network that evolves on free market terms with incentives to increase power all the time.

You appealed to popularity or the fact that many people do something as an attempted form of validation.
The flaw in this argument is that the popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity.
If it did, then the Earth would have made itself flat for most of history to accommodate this popular belief.
Example: Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so many people could believe in leprechauns if they're only a silly old superstition. Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell off his chair.

You are involved in the zero-sum fallacy.
This fallacy is the zero-sum view of wealth, perpetrated since at least the days of regulated Mercantilist economies. Its advocates view the amount of wealth in the world as static: what one man gains, another must lose. The “economic pie” was always there, and it was always the same size.
But how did that pie come into being?

you base all your ideas on the NAP. The non-aggression principle is not axiomatic.
The overall hierarchical organization of philosophy prevents a principle of ethics or politics from being axiomatic. Axioms are the root, starting-place of knowledge of the world. Whether or not it is universally wrong to initiate force is obviously not such a question.

The idea that a 51% attack is possible with a single large amout of money is flawed. 
You actually need to out-compete/out-invest and innovate faster then the top miners. The top miners actually earn Bitcoins/money while they do this. 
A sucessfull attacker also stands to earn Bitcoin/money on the way to 51% capacity. The attacker will not be  spending money on the way to 51% capacity so they will not need a large budget to finance this.
The difficult thing is innovating faster then the global free market. This is where a government will have big problems. No government is more efficient/innovative/rational then the free market.

Lets start with the definition of fiat: 
"Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law. The term fiat currency is used when the fiat money is used as the main currency of the country. The term derives from the Latin fiat ("let it be done", "it shall be").[1]"
Bitcoin derives its value from the utility. BTC is a great means of exchange and store of value. Bitcoin is not backed by any law. Therefore BTC is not fiat.

Aequitas can be taken to mean justice.
The Objectivist view of justice is based largely on fairness; being rewarded (or not) based on objective (visible, measurable) contributions and adherence to moral values. In that light, on the material front, Objectivism rejects egalitarianism, where people are rewarded for just being alive, without consideration to their contributions or the morality of their actions.

You talk as if there is a conflict between doing what is rationally good for you and what would feel good. Emotions can be alligned with your morality. So there is no dichotomy. 
The problem with just following your emotions is that they are not always alligned with the rational and needs to be thought through rationally.

I would say: nothing.
from: 
“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible.

The “sanction of the victim” is the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil, to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the “sin” of creating values.
Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations, and where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was an inverted morality—and that my sanction was its only power. I saw that evil was impotent—that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real—and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to enforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them with the means of their plan—so throughout the world and throughout men’s history, in every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the atrocities of collectivized countries, it is the good, the able, the men of reason, who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, thus gaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values—the impotence of death. I saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue, when his own consent is needed for evil to win—and that no manner of injury done to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw that I could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. I pronounced it. The word was “No.”

Most physical gold "banks" offer 100% reserve banking. Some offer fractional reserve.
I dont know any "fiat"-banks that do not engage in fractional reserve banking but that is because of regulation and insurance by goverment. Bitcoin banks will do this if they are not regulated.

You are wrong. You can follow the inflation rate here:

@_date: 2013-05-05 07:55:45
And? its not used as a payment now and it still goes up in value. so your fist argument is wrong.

Thats just stupid.
People working together on something that make sense is going to create value for everybody. its not a zero sum game.

The only way to create equality of outcome is to bring the best down to the level of the worst.
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:59:58
I agree. Equality as a goal is evil. It requeres bringing the best down to the level of the worst by force.

Bitcoin will not prevent or limiting individuals from investing in new business/technology. If people want those goods more then bitcoins they will buy the products and the inventment will pay off.
Stealing money from people through inflation is NOT a driver for investments. It just transfers welth to stupid government programs.
@_date: 2013-02-22 02:31:42
I think we will double within 2 months. The inflation rate is only 12.5% and people are joining at record speeds.

Its not because we think Bitcoins are valuable they are valuable. Its because they actually are valuable. reality comes first so to say.

You talk as if a monopoly on the retaliatory use of force is a bad thing.
It's actually good to have a constitutionally limited monopoly on the use of force.
If any defence agency can use force arbitrarily it turns into anarchy (mindless use of force).

If bitcoin miners did not go to ASICs that route would be open to potential attackers.
Also ASICs make a conventional botnet attack impractical because it can not compete with ASICs.

you should make your payment methods clear on the front page somehow. I would not go to step 5 to find out if you take bitcoin.

A commitment from all the G20 countries to fight bitcoin with all means possible. High prison sentences for using or accepting bitcoins and direct attacks on the network.

What fact of reality gave rise to the concept “justice”? The fact that man must draw conclusions about the things, people and events around him, i.e., must judge and evaluate them. Is his judgment automatically right? No. What causes his judgment to be wrong? The lack of sufficient evidence, or his evasion of the evidence, or his inclusion of considerations other than the facts of the case. How, then, is he to arrive at the right judgment? By basing it exclusively on the factual evidence and by considering all the relevant evidence available. But isn’t this a description of “objectivity”? Yes, “objective judgment” is one of the wider categories to which the concept “justice” belongs. What distinguishes “justice” from other instances of objective judgment? When one evaluates the nature or actions of inanimate objects, the criterion of judgment is determined by the particular purpose for which one evaluates them. But how does one determine a criterion for evaluating the character and actions of men, in view of the fact that men possess the faculty of volition? What science can provide an objective criterion of evaluation in regard to volitional matters? Ethics. Now, do I need a concept to designate the act of judging a man’s character and/or actions exclusively on the basis of all the factual evidence available, and of evaluating it by means of an objective moral criterion? Yes. That concept is “justice.”

So you actually agree that anarcho-capitalists don't want an objective law.
Objective laws are laws formed using objectivity

The 1% have about 50% of all the bitcoins so you would need:
10.5M / ((7 Billion people)/100) = 0.14 BTC 


To be in the 1% of the 1% you would need:
5.25M / ((7 Billion people)/100/100) = 7.5

you read it wrong. its traded on a free market so it can have any value.
@_date: 2013-05-05 10:39:04
I disagree. Something can have value as a store of value. You don't need to use it as payment. Bitcoin is currently like a shared store of value. Like a shared piggy-bank. That is an amazing feature in and of itself. People value that.
