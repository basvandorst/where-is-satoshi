Yeah.  On November 9th, coinbase announced internally to their employees that they were going to start btrash trading.  The day after that, BCH volume went up by 700%.

What specifically do you do in "enterprise IT" that gives you any insight whatsoever into coinbase's challenges?

Okay, I have the eclair wallet, but how do I actually open a channel to starblocks?

Oohhhhhhkay bros.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:24:46
Have you looked at using a transaction accelerator, or is it not that big of a deal to you?
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:12:38
I've never used one, I just know they exist.  I think somebody was on here promoting one yesterday actually. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:23:04
Hire bitcoin core a damn public relations team.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:09:44
Yes you need a bitcoin.conf.  Specify a username and password in that.
I'm at dinner right now but as soon as I'm home I'll copy mine to you so you can use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:27:35
It looks like you do.  My current plan is a pretty large digital ocean instance. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:58:01
Look for if there is an option when starting bitcoind to specify a config file manually.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:15:40
For the people asking for a tutorial in here, it really isn't that hard.  Basically:
     apt-get update
     apt-get install bitcoind
     
That will get you a full bitcoin node running.
To get a lightning node running, just follow the instructions here: 
But even the instructions there are pretty straightforward.  You start lightning with the following command (from within your build directory):
     lightningd/lightningd --network=bitcoin --log-level=debug
(network=bitcoin means run it on the mainnet instead of testnet)
And then you interact with lightning via the CLI:
     cli/lightning-cli pay $some_invoice_string
It's really shockingly straightforward.  If anybody has questions, I would be happy to try and answer them.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:34:34
The other thing is the port.  I think after ha t you're good.

The *promise* that there wasn't any insider trading.  Pay no attention to the 7x volume increase on btrash the day after they told their employees about it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:45:00
Hey I can say that!
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:27:12
Not on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:12:07
This is a really common misconception.  You don't open a channel *with a coffee shop*, you open a channel to a network that includes he coffee shop, and likely thousands of other merchants.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:21:11
I want to add more sats to my channel.  I have to close it and then refund it as a new channel, right?
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:40:48
This is exactly what I did.  Second best decision of my life.
Just set it and forget it on CB.

@_date: 2018-01-18 19:23:04
This kills the btrash.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:20:45
Yeah good for you.  I'm saying that coinbase's claims that there was no insider trading are absolutely ridiculous, not that there weren't some leaks a month later.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:01:34
Done yet?  Waiting on my channel to finish funding!  C'mon baby gimme that sweet $100 sticker!

Will any of these work without require a fully chain-updated bitcoind?
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:53:23
As far as I know, qt is still running a full bitcoind on the backend, so yes.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:14:10
Bitcoin went up by like 5x and arguably launched this entire crypto market that we're all enjoying right now.  Hundreds of thousands of new accounts were created, CNBC, bloomberg, fox business, WSJ, yahoo finance, and I'm sure others started talking about bitcoin *constantly*.
It wasn't out of nowhere.  There are a fuckload of new accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:26:34
Add my one more.  Just waiting for bitcoind to sync.
I miss the old bootstrap.dat file.  I remember hosting that on a bittorrent seed box back in the day.
Edit: Pretty cool that bitcoin completely synced over night (main net!!)
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:35:20
What wallet can I use that supports lightning on main net tho?
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:21:24

Bitcoin is a fork of *what* there friendo?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:22:15
That's exactly what it was.  Coinbase lent a lot of legitimacy to crypto for mainstreet investors, and when they added bcash, I think it damaged that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:03:21
He said up to THIRTY PERCENT of his NW is in BTC.  His net worth (according to forbes) is ~$1 Billion.
So he has $300M.  How do you think he stores it?  On a fucking trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:26:09
I mean...I just sent about $20,000 across the world for next to nothing, and it took approximately a minute to confirm.
Bitcoin *is* a currency.  It just doesn't work very well when:
1) People are spamming the mempool.
2) Demand is high.
Nooooo shit.

Just leave your coins on coinbase.  The people telling you otherwise are the crazy libertarian holdovers who would also suggest buring cash in jars in your backyard.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:05:27
IT'S CALLED BITCOIN *TRASH* REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:42:15
Paying the exit fees on gdax is *extremely* suspect to me.  My only guess is that they've got to have some contracts with a large mine who will give them priority processing for a low fee or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:08:44
When people are saying this: do they mean little or no network fee?  Good luck with that right now.  The transfer will take like a week.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:45:28
I definitely wouldn't go that far.  Bcash definitely raises some alarms, though.
I mean...first of all actually literally Roger Ver is involved in it (which should be enough of a GIANT red flag), but then, let's think about this timeline:
1) China announces that they are (maybe really this time!) banning bitcoin mining.
2) Suddenly the largest chinese mine in the world's owner starts shilling for some new bitcoin fork which centralizes the infrastructure.
It just smells rotten to me.
Bitcoin is a MASSIVE threat to China.  The fact that they would be trying to destroy it, or at least replace it with something centralized should not surprise anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:23:29
It's free to after between coinbase and grace (obviously).  What people are saying is that it is also free to defer from gdax to an *external* wallet.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:25:04
$25M even at a *modest* 5% annual ROI is 1.25M/year.
That's almost exactly $100k/mo, or $25k/week.
That's a lot of money man.  You should invest it into bitcoin tho.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:46:33
How can I do this?  Is it possible without downloading the entire blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:40:20
It's going to take time.  With fees being what they are[1], I'm only slowly moving my coins into segwit compatible wallets.
Basically any time something comes off of an exchange, I put it into a segwit wallet.  The VAST majority of my stack is still in a non-segwit address, and that means that at least half of my transactions will be non-segwit.
[1]: Whenver I send anything more than a few $100, I always make a small (~$100) transaction first, let it at least transmit, and *then* do the larger one.  It's my little failsafe against fat fingering or exchange fuckery.  This means that my fees are almost always 2x what they would be though (since I'm paying first for the small Tx, then for the second larger one). 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:34:06
True.  It's still a shitpile of money.  It's easily private jets and multiple houses money.  And whatever supercars you want money.
At $1.25M/yr, you could make your annual new-years-eve tradition be lighting a brand new lamborghini on fire and driving it off a cliff and you would STILL have $1M/yr to spend on whatever else you wanted.
After 10 years of this, you'd have the carcasses of 10 burned out lambos at the bottom of a cliff and still be living of a functioning millionaire.
People near this cliff would be extremely confused at the pile of burned out lambos.  And you'd still be a multimillionaire.

Same.  I pulled out about 0.5BTC back in August to buy a bike.  It's a hell of an expensive bike at this point, but I have no regrets.
Also you're all welcome.  As soon as I sold, the price started pumping hard.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:28:24
Okay, I've honestly flipped about 100% on coinbase (who I used to shill for constantly), but...what makes you think they're running a fractional reserve?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:02:36


Vanguard targeted funds earn ~8% per year.  $80k/yr (if you don't compound *at all*) is plenty to retire on.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:47:08
So would I.  Like for instance letting some orphans drive my lambos.

Goddamnit, JOHN!  You don't gain anything by failing to see his valid fucking points.
No, there was *effectively* not a block size limit because despite the limit literally *existing*, there was *effectively* no limit because it had NO EFFECT on the fucking blocks!
Letting him just make this point doesn't hurt anything.  It just makes you look like an ass!
I'm a small blocker forever, and I think that bcash is an outright scam, but you're not helping *anybody* by being intentionally obtuse about these things.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:21:52
Huge blocks make it more costly (and difficult) to run a node as an individual.  It centralizes the network in large datacenters instead of being the decentralized, P2P system that bitcoin was intented to be.
Which is why Jihan and Roger support it.  Jihan runs one of the largest mines in the world (maybe the largest?) and Roger is already a millionaire (as he keeps saying) who can afford to run a datacenter.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:34:22

This argument about "the whitepaper" is ridiculous.
Bcash is absolutely *not* peer to peer, you depend on centralized mining datacenters to process your transactions.
Peer to peer is exactly WHY small blockers exist.  So that I can still run a node in my house.

Gotta be honest, I wanted to pick up a few chainlink (it's a alt/shitcoin/erc20 token), and am pretty happy with an exchange called "binance".  It's the only one that seems to sell this token, but so far it's really fast (read: acts like a reasonable website in 2017).
No clue about it's long term stability, but it's definitely better than kraken has been for me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:00:21
I mean...what you're describing is why servers, house cleaners, cab drivers, landscapers, etc all prefer to be paid in cash.  Servers not claiming their tips is a BIG thing that the IRS turns a blind eye to.
If you buy a coffee with your gains and don't claim it, the IRS is probably going to ignore you too.  This is going to be a problem if you try to buy bigger things like a house or a car though.

Roger, I think you're misguided on *how* you want to scale bitcoin, and I think that trying to co-opt the name "bitcoin" for the alt-coin you are pushing is a really bad thing to do.
I would love to see you just admit that bcash was a bad idea, and come back to bitcoin.

It's also a strong signal to all major investors that this stuff isn't going anywhere.
