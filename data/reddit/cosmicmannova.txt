It's illegal to buy currency (including digital) without a license. People have been getting busted for selling bitcoin to others.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:04
Happening in US. Brings a lot of credibility to general people.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:43:15
Bitcoin ATMs are anonymous to around $500 or so
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:47:08
Still. It's Rogan. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:41:59
Powerful Joe Rogan? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:19:27
Could correct when the futures start 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:45:09
Use Gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:50:43
You can sell it for 10,000. :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:18:25
Thanks guys. I take it back! ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:31
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:07:30
Yeah can't read it
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:24
Up over 15% in the past hour on coin base
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:48
Yeah send from Gdax - no fee!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:23
Futures coming soon
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:05:05
No fees to send from gdax
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:04
Yep, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:30:54
No one cares
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:29:04
Gdax doesn't charge
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:41:25
It's over 17000 on my end
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:32:31
It's a good deal if you used the 95k to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:48
Could drop once the futures start
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:30:32
Free on Gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:31:30
Never had a problem 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:04:44
I see what he means. My buddy decided to buy litecoin because he would be able have a complete coin as opposed to decimals of bitcoin. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:06:17
3 years away
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:50:43
Then it sounds like a good deal to me
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:54:08
Try vertcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:30:11
Coinbase/Gdax has seen a lot of delays. Maybe wait 24 hrs.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:59:09
NiceHash are morons. Should have hired hackers to try and hack them and then fixed the problems. If they were really hacked and it's not an inside job that is. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:01:34
I've told them all and they all laughed. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:51:13
What's hard to understand? Volume is no where wear it used to be.
Because of joe schmo types buying into all the ponzie and fake mining scams that went bust at the beginning of the year.  
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:15:32
"Nakamoto says he'll also explain the critical role that cyphers and encryption related to Chaldean numerology played in his creation of bitcoin."
Not only numerology but the names (Bitcoin, Nakamoto, etc) share a lot in Gematria: 
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:00:03
can get one for 80k, but yeah
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:05:18
It's called Gematria. Lot of people believe in it: 
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:16:23
Not at all. It's a big thing with some Jewish people and the kabbalah.
@_date: 2019-08-18 00:26:45
Sounds like what Bitcoin Ben was pushing a while back but a different name. Hodl or something. Don't think it ever got off the ground.
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:58:41
There isn't enough Bitcoin for all the millionaires in the world if they tried buying 1 BTC each. Make sense now?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:05:03
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:16:20
Nope. No fees to send.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:32:08
What's it say?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:10:07
Use Gdax. No fees. It's coinbase's exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:23:55
I like bittrex. There's kraken and poloniex outside US, too.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:13:58
Passed when it was $20
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:45:38
Use coinbase's Gdax exchange. No fees.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:04:57
Vertcoin mining might be an option. Check their sub for more info.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:04:35
9700 on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:22:00
Coin Base's Gdax charges no fees for sending 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:46
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:34:39
Probably means they are getting a lot of traffic
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:34:18
Wow. How desperate lol.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:05:52
Coinbase owns Gdax
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:15:17
Coin Base you can connect your pay pal debit card.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:54:52
somebody just dumped a sh-t load of BTC
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:52:43
And at the same time all the bankers are creating their own cryptos. That's really what it is about. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:57:01
Ahh. My bad.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:40:04
Still have a chance, bro
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:32:38
Yes using coinbase and PayPal debit card 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:31:12
 No
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:46:01
I'm in a BTC investment program. Fellow investor told us. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:16:25
Wondering the same. 200% interest; however, when I signed up no confirmation of e-mail etc.  Now it looks to be down.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:34:33
Hold on for dear life 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:48:04
Friend of a friend says his buddy does work with Amazon. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:28:16
Depends what you bought at I guess and how much you got in. I think BTC is going to go s lot higher. The higher it goes, the more mainstream recognition it will get, which will lead to more acceptance, and it will go even higher. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:52:58
Going way up bro
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:53:09
Govt prints as much money as it needs. Income tax has nothing to do with paying for anything. *paying for any govt. service.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:11:11
Works for me
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:50:22
Gemini is great. I just opened an account within the last couple of weeks. Verification was in like a day or so.
