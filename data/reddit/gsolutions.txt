Banks can't print money, only the federal mint can do that.

Less risky than us bonds?

I mean the flyer is wrong. Saying you are the bank is only correct in that you hold the money. I could do that with fiat, it's called a regular wallet. It's not like you are the bank in that you issue loans or anything.

This person pays over 30% in taxes. Taxes are being paid. It's about reducing the burden.

I guess that would be his main question, I mean sure in a full blown audit it will become apparent, but otherwise he is wondering if it would go relatively unnoticed assuming the bitcoin to fiat isn't immediately reported to the feds. Namely if it is withdrawn in small amounts that don't legally have to be reported (&lt;$10k)

Like I said though, who would be reporting it? If he didn't report it and the client didn't report it, who is doing the reporting? My understanding is that bitpay only reports over $10k.

Yah exactly. The drive is the bottleneck, I have 16 goes of ram, a good video card, a bleeding edge processor,  but the disk slows everything down. May have to take advantage of this.

Bitcoin AND one-time-pads combined? My two favorite things? This is awesome.

I have 2tb of ssds but would like to migrate to full ssd all the time. I have 5tb of data I'd love to all be ssd ready as I do a lot of graphic design.

Just reading this now. So for example my business sells Web design and marketing services, can I really cut out the PayPal and stripe fees with this? Is this real life?

No because the payment processors report all money you get, you can't fudge the numbers because they tell the government how much they processed for you.

Bitcoin is the least anonymous currency I could think of. Cash is anonymous.
