The chart above is a little deceptive/simple and flat, there needs to be a curve in the line to appreciate the actual rate of increase.   
And as a disclaimer there is no correlation between this prediction and the change of value of the USD, I think this compounding factor will actually exacerbate the effects. If BTC goes to $100k in todays value over the next 4 years and the dollar halves in value in that time, then it won't be $100k, it'll be $200k. But people wont be able to distinguish between the increase in value of BTC and the drop in value of the dollar.
Either way fiat is on it's last legs.

That makes a lot of sense, there were over 1500 coins traded in a five min period.   
The volumes being moved about (only orders I know but still) are crazy, theres an order for 1500 coins at 4972. and 900 at 4719... cray.

wut?! for real? where did you get this number from!??!! :O
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:35:23
yeah i get that man, I am just curious where you came up with 36million.... did you make it up? or do you have a citation for that titbit!?
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:29:31
Brilliant switch of psychology. GOOD JOB! I think we should always refer to it this way.

Not true mate, lots of times a marriage can make a person ten times better and more successful than they were.   
My first marriage cost me a couple hundred grand, but I wouldn't trade it for the world, it was worth every cent (seriously). She grew me up some, we had a great time and I think we both came out of it better people. I for one was then more sure than ever what I wanted in a woman.   
Few years later when I met the girl that fitted that (well paid for) outline of what I needed in my life and because of that experience I knew it when I saw it. We now we have two lovely kids, ten times more cash than I lost and we are doing what we love/moving in a direction we both want to be moving, at high speed!  
So don't poopoo the hitch mate, they can be truely rewarding (you just need to know what you want/need and hopefully not be deceived by your would be partner).

haha I see what you did there. :D
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:52:34
Well... I was more meta thinking about the bitcoin reddit communities thing... the only reason i mentioned going to the altcoin site, ironically btc in name but not in content, was to tell people to perhaps go to it and check out how much its just shilling BCH... not "totally bro down with it". But what ever floats your boat man.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:06:54
Yeah I like have 5 trillion bitcoins and am pretty sure I won't get the cops knocking on my door.... because.... of all my richness and all. Obviously.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:52:20


That is a ridiculous and gross over simplification. They have a *different* view of women.  
The hate filled generalising rhetoric you employ is out of line.   
If these people choose not to like women and make a support group for themselves then who are you to oppose them, call them names and call them unhealthy? (I disagree with their sentiments, but I'm not going to say they are wrong because *I personally* disagree, many of them may be able to lead perfectly healthy, productive lives without ever committing to a woman).  
Would you say the same of the LGBT? Would you say the same of Feminists? Or Vegans? They have differing views to most, they have support groups for themselves and they often say hateful shit about "men" "women" "meat eaters" etc.  
Seriously, think about what it is you are trying to force on others, and that you, at the same time are calling *them* hateful, I hope you sort yourself out.

I am noticing a logical inconsistency to your message. Perhaps you would like to rephrase it?
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:03:40


Good call... and Thanks! I didn't know about that list... I'm probably banned from r/btc now. lol. "whoopsies".
@_date: 2019-04-11 09:40:16
Riiiiiiight.....  
So do you use that 'logic' to oppose every ideology that has had terrorism committed in its name?   
Like.... for instance.... Islam? How about Christianity? Or Feminism? And Antifa?   
As I am sure you know that they've all had terrorism committed in their names by whack-jobs.   
So we should not tolerate them equally?
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:04:54
Agree with you wholeheartedly, Libertarianism and Bitcoin are certainly the only way (I see) of moving forward past this trashy consumerist inflationary economic grenade we have been wallowing in for decades.  
I think hedging into crypto, gold and guns is a smart move if you cant secure your government through libertarianising them!
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:31:31


Holy shit.... you sound like a box of positivity, joy and light don't you?  
If I may be so bold... I think you are exactly the type of person that these MGTOWs are succeeding in avoiding.  
If you would like to have someone in your life (I make this assumption because you are so obviously super threatened by blokes choosing NOT to engage in relationships with ladies); Perhaps, if your goal is to bag your self a man long term, you could try to be a positive, helpful member of society?
If someone shies away from something (Women, Men, Vegetables, Meat, Video games, guns, children or whatever) perhaps just leave them to it!  
The only thing worse than someone who is negative and toxic is someone who is pushing their negativity onto others.

Well there was a half percent drop in the pound when the pollies there couldn't agree on what to do with the whole brexit saga, it was the only global thing that happened to occur at the same time as the pump.   
Looks more like it was just because the price of BTC passed a TA trigger. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
