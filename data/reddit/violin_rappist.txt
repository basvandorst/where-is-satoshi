the "dirty paper money" is worth something because it's used in billions of transactions per day, to actually purchase goods and services. i own bitcoin, so i hope it does well, but 99%+ of people who own it don't own it as a currency, but as a get-rich-quick scheme

"we" as in you and i? and everyone on r/bitcoin? how much net cash do you actually think we control compared to massive investors?

jpm alone controls two and a half trillion fucking dollars. TRILLION. that is ONE financial institution.
the average american cash savings is less than $1,000. you would need 3 *billion* people putting that amount into bitcoin to match that kind of buying power. and the vast, vast majority of people have far less than $1k in savings.
the top 1% control more wealth than the rest. you can't beat them, sorry

I am not looking at their balance sheet, but I am sure they don't just have that sitting in a pile of cash, which would be an enormous waste of capital. the top 25 banks each have somewhere between 1 trillion and 3 trillion in assets, and plenty of insurance companies manage trillions as well

that is not even remotely true, options are very valuable in many cases when used as protective insurance. i'm guessing if you think options are gambling then you've never heard of a protective put, meaning you've spend exactly 10 seconds learning what options are, and at least double that amount of time talking shit about them online

i hate to tell you this but they do not have to buy bitcoin to influence it's price

well, you're the one that made the original assertion, it's up to you to prove it, not tell people to prove you wrong.
your assertion is also blatantly false. if the big players, investment banks, etc control billions, they can influence the price far more than you and i can, and if we "panic sell" or not, it doesn't really matter. if hundreds of billions of dollars pull out of bitcoin, it will crash
you should really learn the very fundamentals of financial markets
