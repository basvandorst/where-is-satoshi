May as well continue to be willfully ignorant, right?

I used localbitcoins.com, it was the quickest as I just met somebody near my work and didn't require any verification etc.
*Edit to clarify, it's a good setup they have, seems secure enough to me for the amounts I bought and doesn't require ID or any of that for 'verification' is what I was referring to.

Hi kmdr, I just wanted to tell you that your post inspired me to go searching for my long lost Bitcoin that I was all but certain was lost.. with success!! I found it on an old backup :D
1.00 BTC in my Wallet now, it's such a relief because I was a little sad I had lost it. I stopped caring when it crashed to ~$4 only to start watching it go up and up again in the last two months all the while knowing I had one but threw it out.

Me too, the crazy fees on localbitcoins are irrational.
To clarify the fees are premiums the *sellers* are charging ($140 per coin atm is the best price (there's others for more) vs $122 on mtgox), not localbitcoins, they actually seem to have a decent setup.

I used them once, for anybody curious they give you a secret code once the seller agrees to the transaction then you meet up in person.  This is the only part where you could get scammed because one of you has to give the other something first, but once the sellers sends the funds to you he gets the same secret code and tells it to you, if it's a match then you're good to go.
