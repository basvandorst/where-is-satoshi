That would be nice! What if you could buy an app for $5, and get a wallet preloaded with $5 of bitcoins. Would that be against the App Store agreement?

Not really, because then it most likely wouldn't go through.
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:50:06
Not quite. All transactions start off unconfirmed, right? My question is about how many remain permanently unconfirmed.

I think all wallets provide this check right?...Unless it goes straight to the "lost and found" of the developer pockets.

God damn...

Thanks for the ELI5 on https.It looks like I misunderstood and am confused the purpose of github in your comment. I wasn't originally suggesting that bitaddress should use, let alone care about my version. I don't want to commit, pull, etc— I don't even know what any of that would accomplish. I wanted to contribute what I could — the design concept — and ask you guys from a tech standpoint, what steps to take to get people to trust the tech, without having to trust me. Is that even possible?

Thanks. This was definitely a fun little UX experiment.
If you look at the Javascript you'll see that it's using bitaddress.org's code. So if you can trust that site, you can trust this one, assuming of course, you'd download the file and run it cold.

The logo is big because its part of what's called a design direction- in this case, the direction is big, bright and bold. That applies to the font weight, colors used, size of the circles, etc. That's the reason it's big. If the logo were small, I would not fit the overall look of the page.
The typography is much better than what it was. I chose the fonts to for the needs, instead of going with the defaults. For example, the keys themselves are laid out in a much more readable format with those line breaks. For it to appear tidy and to complement the squareness of the QR code, I used a monospaced font. There is also a deliberate attempt to put less text on the page. Typography is about communication, and my version is more direct with less technical details and fluff.
Colors are very subjective, but still improvements were made. The palette, like the typography, is intentional and cohesive, rather than default blue text links and gray buttons, paired with muddy green and orange. My colors are bright and festive. They're emotive rather than passive.
About the styling — look again. Bitaddress has a noisy layout with lots of code, and paragraphs of text that you don't want to read. For the part I chose to redesign, I opted for shorter clearer messages to not appear cluttered. The typography is better. The colors are better. The layout is stronger: there's a obvious center arrangement.
User friendliness. I didn't say it was perfect, but it's definitely more user friendly. Example: The amount of mouse-moving asked of the user has been cut down drastically for a better experience. You see... all of these elements - the visual and interactive ones - play a huge part in making something user-friendly. My version is definitely better to look at, read, and use. Maybe next time when you offer your critiques, you should be more constructive. But it first helps to know what you're talking about.

If we assume the masses don't mind centralization (since they currently **trust** PayPal, amazon, etc with their credit cards and bank accounts), what would be the purpose of Bitcoin? Also, is the "Bitcoin is anonymous" point moot since people would supply vendors with shipping information when they buy physical goods?
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:22:46
Thank you! I will ask my server admin about https.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:28:53
Yes...My question is about how many statistically, are invalid?
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:00:15
Purpose wasn't the right word — I meant to say "advantage." Philosophically, if someone don't care about those key values of Bitcoin, they would need some substantial advantage to change their habits, right?

Dumb question- can a person validate the absence of malware by looking at the source alone, or is there something on the server side that needs to happen (certificates?)
So you're saying, I should pull bit address' code and ask them to confirm that my version is a valid, modified version of theirs? Excuse my ignorance, I don't know much about git hub.

One thought on the font choice: It's not serious-looking enough. A little too fancy rogue and stylized for this kind of information. A more restrained choice would serve the content better.

I'm not a developer but any who can shed light on this, please do. I assume that if the app is loaded in memory (but not the active one being looked at by the person), the camera would be off and not drain the battery.
