i prefer sepa over bticoin at the moment....and it bothers me.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:05:39
you might be right. I have little respect for many that are responsible for destroying this wonderful project.
For the record - politics and self-entitlement are slowing things down - not the theory and not the coding.

How do I reach theeeese kiiiids?!
Open your eyes.

29 - much numbers, very wow.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:47:01
and it only took them 6 years.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:03:43
its beyond me how you don't see it...its everywhere.
luckily I don't have to waste alot of energy on you - you are PROBABLY beyond saving:  
   
This was before the fork - it even easier to spot now...
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:33:13
fees are not about security, but about spam protection and incentivizing miners once the blockreward is gone. nothing more.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:29:29
Wow, spot on. Pretty good analysis.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:12:15
but a fraction of other projects...
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:12:11
they've been talking about this for years.
the progess is just soooooooo slow - at this rate nobody here is still going to be alive, when btc finally scales.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:40
ffs its a fork. i dont see why core has more claim to the brand than a fork that is pretty close to the protocol 1 year ago...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:38:46
at least the youtubers that talk about crypto mainly have male viewers between 18-40. my source is crypt0 he has a decent viewer count and i would say its a stong indicator that its true:)
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:07:41
guys stop the games and drama.
every coin can be called the way it wants.
why do you even  care?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:41:38
i disagree. blocksize has nothing to do with control.
the doubling of blocksize has to do with onchain scaling and no rational argument if heard has convinced me it would be bad to double the blocksize.
yes there are different parties persueing their own interest, but im not interested in politics. i want whats best for bitcoin and neither party is persuing that...
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:14:10
this is just politics and im sick of it
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:24:33
not really. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:56:21
this is getting ridiculous. let the market do its thing...
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:06:01
boi first of all, you sound like the exchanges are your new banks - go sheep go.
second, price is always a range. every matched offer is within the price range. i can sell my btc on ebay for 1 billion if want to (to be confirmed though), thats pretty much the joke with peer to peer currency. that we dont necessarily need an exchange to exchange value. also im pretty sure that there are exchanges that dont do automatic order matching.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:13:07
yes for the core fanclub. for me segwitt and the core roadmap has to prove itself first. I dont really understand the reasoning and reluctance to increase blocks to 4mb (for example) to help adoption until other solutions are ready. it was proven that 4mb wont increase centralization if i remember correctly.
ill keep both and if core fails to scale soon enough I wont even flinch to call bch bitcoin.
to be clear: i despise bch for keeping asic boost just for that moron miner guy, but im not a core fan either.

steal the name from who?

bullshit - this is personal. nobody is whining about bitcoin gold.
for me personally i see both as "bitcoin" contenders.

not if the dollar crashes ;) Its not impossible in 3 years. But i hope not....

16k is not much money. there i said it. a few years ago a tv was 2k and everybody had one.

Nobody is paying with bitcoin. 100&amp; Maestro.
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:20:52
yes I know about that, but at some point we will have to upgrade. im just wondering if some of the features we develop are going to be wasted if we we need to change it.

For fusion the waste from the activated reactor components will be reusable within less than 100 years, for fission the waste is still hazardous after more than 1000 years.   
Please don't get all your information from youtube and please don't spread your stupidity on other platforms.

all he needs to do is buy 1 bitcoin for 1 million on a exchange and he doesnt need to cut off his dick and eat it...
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:32:16
wtf no? why? 1 trade at a price is technucally enough

Where is the incentive to create CLEAN energy?
The only incentive I see is to create energy of any kind.

if this can kill btc then dont save it.   
means its not as resistant as we keep telling everbody

battle tested from the first second.

just dont worry too much. btc will be fine :)

big picture - unnatural growth prevents sustainability - causes more enviromental hazards - co2
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:47:19
how delusional can this community get?  
we are using too much energy and causing our own doom.  whether some shit fest useless industry exists that even causes more environmental harm doesnt make it better at all.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:19:05
its ridiculous how much some people care about such a detail. ffs I wouldnt give a shit if they called it bitcorn... stop wasting energy on this and start doing something productive.   
make bitcorn great again!  
Disclaimer:  
I hold bitcorn and bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:45:23
well its about technology. may the better win.   
i dont see bcash as threat.

Scaling debates are a thing of the past?!  
Please get help.
LN is cool and all but on-chain transactions are important.   
As long as Bitcoin and its' adoption are growing the debates are not over...
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:18:49
the article in ijcrb states many sources.  
The idea is that increased money supply can stimulate consumption, which in return stimulates economic growth.
That consumption is linked to environmental pollution.

what he is saying is, that printing money to unnaturally force the world economy to steadily grow at all costs, is what is killing the planet.

pretty sure this comment will be deleted :)

Sorry for my "lol..."
For economic growth and its impact on environment its' hopefully not necessary to provide one paper, right?  
(just in case check out   
and 
that GDP and money supply are correlated (you'll find many sources... e.g.

oh  do i really have to say it?
-solve scaling (i dont care how - but imo i would go both ways - bigger blocks and higher tier scaling solutions lightning)   
-stop having a single dev team (filled with very capable narcissists)   
-move at least 1/2 mining out of china
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:20:54
and who cares? bitcoin is discussed at the wef, lightning is getting ready, price went up to 20k...  
all while the feared bch was already calling itself bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:10:02
y impossible to regulate, just like the internet.   
 oh wait...
