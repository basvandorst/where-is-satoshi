Dear Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, Chairwoman White:
I write today to express my concerns about Cash. This paper currency is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency.
By way of background, Cash is a currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its relation to illegal transactions.  Each Cash is defined by a paper bill, which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions.
The very features that make Cash attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to Cash’s anonymity, the market has been extremely susceptible to muggers and scam artists stealing millions from Cash users. Anonymity combined with Cash’s ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions. 
Cash has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items. Individuals are able to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally. The clear ends of Cash for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report just this month stating, “There is widespread concern about the Cash’s possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation.” Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.

New Orleans, Louisiana would be a great place, many people come here and tourism is a big plus for having a bitcoin ATM here.

At the same time, you have the blockchain that can track bitcoins. You can use a bitcoin launderer to launder bitcoins just as you can launder dollar bills. Why would he mention it's legal uses if he is proposing that it be banned? He seems to state that other countries are banning it but that is simply not true.

That is just one point that the senator makes, along with several other uneducated assumptions. Please explain to me how you track cash in a drug deal or other illicit transaction, I'm wondering what you mean.

You're a moron if you think Chinese exchanges having less volume is a good thing. They were a large part of why we had our last bull run. The only reason why the price isn't under $900 is because people think this is temporary. Go read a chapter in an econ textbook about supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:33:45
For the most part, yes.

Automated clearing house. It's used for US bank transfers.

The internet going down for 24 hours is *fucking terrible* for bitcoin. Bitcoin would survive but people would not trust internet services as much. Assuming that it's the entire internet and not just a few major sites like this article mentions.

I think you are correct in the long term, but these short/mid term bubbles are a perfect example of the Bitcoin economy having [business cycles]( which is a good sign because it means that there is expansion in our bitcoin economy. Also, it is great that these business cycles are practically uncorrelated (or possibly inversely correlated) to the world economy at large due to bitcoin's decentralized nature and increased use as a safe haven asset.
TLDR: this is an excellent example of the growth in the Bitcoin economy because it resembles the business cycle.

I bought 2 BTC in 2014 and spent it all on mining equipment. I never made that money back. Just buy and hodl. You'll thank yourself later.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:42:32
*NO* just buy and hodl if you want the least risk while investing in bitcoin

You clever bastard.

I mean, yeah. That's how percentages work.

I might be naive to think they would actually use it, but I guess it was something I thought would be cool.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:36:44
I agree it would be a great place to take hold. Street vendors and other small shops would benefit from it.

Trust me, my parents are older than average for parents of a 14 year old. ( My mom is 54)
@_date: 2013-05-26 19:40:01
Wow! Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-05-26 17:02:09
Wow, I did not think that someone would post so much in my behalf! I gave been hoarding loose change found in my house for a few months and I have talked about putting that and some of my long term savings to buy about 2 BTC for long term storage on an armory offline cold storage computer. I plan to deposit my allowance from each two months 50% to bitcoin and 50% into my bank account. So far that is my plan for my savings.

I see, that stinks. Maybe mow the neighbors lawn?

Hi, I am 14 and I bought ~2 BTC for some USB miners to support the network (profit is a goal but probably not ever) I have 1 BTC saved for my future. I am learning python and selling scripts sound cool! Where did you sell them?
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:25:04
I am fourteen, and before the difficulty was huge I mined bitcoin on my computer, now that isn't feasible on computers. See if your parents will let you put your allowance or chore money into bitcoin, like every month.
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:23:38
I too am very grateful for the tip and amazed at how the Internet can do this, totally stunned.
Thanks hardleft!

Nice idea but my family is full of iPhones.

Food and water. That would mean a lot.
