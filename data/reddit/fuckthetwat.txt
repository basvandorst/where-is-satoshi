Multisig and platform availability.

Fair point. Though I installed Copay on iOS and OSX and use it as a 2-of-2 multisig. That way you have a kind of two factor authentication when sending bitcoin.
Ninja edit: I don't know about Trezor or Nano Ledger support.

Ok thanks! Nice quiz, but it was hard not to "peek" once I realized it.
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:35:17
Are you the developer?

It only works when you make an encrypted (password protected) backup via iTunes. From there you can restore to any device.
Note: iCloud backups are unencrypted and will **not** restore your Google Authenticator accounts.

There is no way you can tell which bitcoins are and which bitcoins are not "in circulation".
Ninja-edit: You can for the so called Burn Addresses, e.g. 
These are most likely gone forever.

The 21m money supply limit is a limit from an economical point of view, not a technical limit as is with the block size.

Tagged you as *Smart Economic Dude*. (Assuming you are male).
Thanks for the clear explainations.

I followed the "Beginner’s Guide to ️⚡Lightning️⚡ on a Raspberry Pi" and have my node up-and-running. 
I'll try to answer your questions.
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:10:39
Yes, updated this afternoon. No problems. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:09:28
Nope, not saying that. In my opinion it's good to know how "things" work now when trying to understand bitcoin.

To me this seems like an inside job.
Why are they not posting the transactionid's?
@_date: 2013-10-08 08:22:52
Please don't post any information about how much you're holding where. You don't want to make yourself a possible target and you wouldn't be the first one who's Gox account got emptied.
