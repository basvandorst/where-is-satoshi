Hey OP, let's be honest, it's kind of fucking weird for you to be gifting high school kids BTC wallets out of nowhere. I get you're sounding all nice and genuine and all, but I'm going to go against the circlejerk here.
It's really weird. Like I mentioned in another comment, it would be a different case if it was for a reason (class party, celebrating success, etc. vs out of the blue) or if the gift matched the context (pizza and pop vs btc wallets), but this is kind of out of left field. 
It honestly seems more like you're trying to encourage financially stupid people to get in on BTC so you can make a bigger cut off of idiots than it is doing something nice out of the goodness of your heart.
Past that, it really is feeling cult-like in this thread with every mention of how socially weird this is being downvoted and pushed back. Just my 2 mBTCs.

See your post was nice and actually made sense until the last line. 
You're using a strawman argument, which is not a persuasive means to convince anyone what you're saying, and makes your argument weaker. You're creating an over-exaggerated representation of my argument, and then pointing out how stupid the concept you just made is.

Yes, because the immigrant workers will be thrilled to finally be able to send their paychecks home through bitcoin instead. I'm sure that's on top of their to-do list, and not other things like say, not work for a modern-day slave driver.

It's hard not to be when it's gone through so many ups and downs, with always the same "positive" attitude no matter what... you know what I mean?
I'm not sure if facebook is a good example, just because I feel like the past couple of years of facebook updates (same with youtube) has just been fine-tuning it for investors.
It's like once you get to the point where you have huge potential, I don't think any person could turn away from the cash incentive.

You realize your comment only contributes to that feel?
@_date: 2014-04-17 08:50:58
I didn't imply anything, I straight out said "I'm leaning on ..."
You also clearly have no idea what you're talking about. You didn't just "provide an example of how silly that sounds," you set up an over-exaggerated situation and used that as a counter, that's literally what a strawman argument is. You might want to hold off commenting and at least google what you're claiming you're not doing.
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:23:25
That's a nice example for in-class, but that kind of makes it sound stupid don't you think? If I was in that class I would ask, "What's the point of announcing it to everyone? Why not just give him 1 BTC? It's not like I care. Why should I have to hear when every single exchange happens?"
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:16:10


With great idiocy comes great loss. Sucks for your family. You won't see it but the only people who will encourage you to keep going or worse, give you advice on what to tell your wife/family, are the people that can benefit from others making bad investments.
Think about it this way, why would someone be motivated to help you? Because chances are you are going to fuck up, like you just did btw, and they will make money off of your fuck ups and those of many others.
Good luck to your wife and kids.
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:41:16
In all honesty, don't. The people encouraging you to invest are the ones whose own stash of bitcoins will only increase in value from having more people enter the market - they're not giving suggestions for your own good, but for theirs.
Save up some more money and put it into a high interest savings account. You won't risk losing your life savings, will make a steady gain on interest, and appreciate it when BTC goes up to 600 then down to 350 again.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:12:12
I don't think you realize this but it is because dogecoin is a joke. The joke gets funnier when you have someone replicating the bitcoin in apple screensaver thing.

Then STOP FUCKING RISKING IT by gambling it away in secret! Do you not understand the shit you're about to put your family through? The people on here are right, the ones encouraging you to stay in bitcoin are the ones who would profit the most from your mistakes. Where do you think money is made here? Buy low from desperate people, and sell high to other desperate people. Rinse and repeat.

Let's be honest with ourselves, that's wishful thinking. There are 100,000 avid bitcoiners here. Definitely likely even more that don't reddit. Let's say 200,000 to make it a safe number? According to the forbes article I'll attach at the end (which was the most recent &amp; semi-good estimate of a number I could find) there are 300 million iphone owners (6 months ago). So if double the number of bitcoiners that are subscribed to this sub dropped from apple (assuming they all own iphones), they would only lose 0.00066666666% of their market. It's not even 0.1%. (Unless my math is off). I can safely say apple could lose that many users overnight and there wouldn't even be an emergency meeting about it.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:10:37

You have no idea what you're talking about. Try clicking the link and reading the two short paragraphs. Pokemon and DayZ have nothing to do with beliefs and the exploitation of them. You're comparing apples to oranges in a weak attempt to shift attention away from BTC.


Pokemon and DayZ don't cross into that territory, BTC however does.
The people encouraging others to invest are doing so not out of the goodness of their own heart, but because the more negligent people invest and lose money, the more money they can make (aka advance own goals). This carries over to abusing members' trust. The subreddit does a great job shaming subscribers for divergent thinking. 
And the cherry on top? Every other cryptocurreny is a false/lesser system.
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:29:25


As guaranteed as it was to go from $1000 in value to ~$400ish right? Oh wait, that's not profit.
As much as I love BTC, making ridiculous statements like guaranteed profits won't help anyone, and will only add more people to the list of people who need the suicide hotline  after each collapse. Don't guarantee anything unless you can live with the possibility that you've encouraged some idiot to gamble and lose his life savings and then take his life.

Not that I agree with that system, but think about it. Would those apps have had the same success if they didn't have that spot on Apples app store? No. That's why app develops go to businesses to launch their apps. The app maker uses the app store as a hub to advertise and make their app easily findable, rateable, shareable, etc. It would both make sense for the app maker to have to pay for this service and for apple to receive money for hosting it.
Ultimately it wouldn't make sense for any business to create a hub that they have to pay for servers, monitoring, quality control, etc, and then offer it to devs for free. It's simply a business transaction.
It's the same reason why youtube gets a cut of the profit from ad money made by youtube video makers. Youtube hosts the servers, the interface, and most importantly the huuuuuge user base, so the content creators give a cut to youtube. It's literally a win-win siutation. Whether that % of profits is fair or not, I dont know. 30% of sales doesn't sound too huge to me in exchange for the publicity and user base. I mean hell, every iproduct sold is another potential customer to the devs.

You tell me how broad it is:
- Deceit in recruitment (Invest in bitcoin, get a high pay-off!) : is debatable
- Totalitarian/requires complete subservience: have you seen many opposite viewpoints upvoted/encouraged in this sub? I haven't. It's always the same "don't comment if you have nothing good to say" and "this is good for bitcoin!"
- Destroys family unit: how many people have fucked up their relations due to "advice" they've followed to get rich quick?
- Isolates its members: debatable. I'd say members isolate themselves.
- Exploits and manipulates its members: Checkeroo
- Questioning basic tenants is not allowed: Checkeroo
This sub specifically hits many of these points on the head.

You're the one being dramatic right now. Would you go to a class full of high school kids and give them pepsis or dimes? If so, why? What's the point in doing so? Sure it's mighty nice of you, but it's out of nowhere. That's what makes it weird. 
Alternatively, setting up a year end party or a celebratory party to congratulate a class on doing great on a test with a pizza and pop party is contextually appropriate. Do you see the difference in the situations?
OP gifting wallets to a class of high school kids is surprisingly out of nowhere, and you have to guess what the intentions behind it are. I'm leaning on encouraging financially stupid people to invest money into BTC for OP to make money off of.
