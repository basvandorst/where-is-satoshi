This sounds like a good service with lots of potential. I have a few issues though:
My use case is that I want to buy fuss free stock photography for a web site, for example. How can I be sure that the photo in question is free of copyright after paid? Who do I sue when I'm sued for royalties? You?

I only need contact details for a natural person to pass on the responsibility.

Cheap and fuss free stock photos! Just what I needed.

I am a happy Tradehill customer myself. They accept free SEPA (European banks) transactions, which was a must for me.

I could sell my own photo by giving my contact details in the description.

I didn't notice that. Damn. I wonder what is the preferred method of liquidating the bitcoins into Euros now?
Mt Gox wants 2% fees of withdraws, minimum of 0.35 euros.
Edit: Bitcoin Central wants 15 EUR flat for SEPA withdraws. Damn.

Yeah, it should take Ethereum.

Thanks for the answers.
I found this to be an excellent guide to Rootstock, including the whitepaper of course.
In my opinion, this might work, but it has quite a number of question marks. Basically it aims to bring Ethereum capabilities (minus proof of stake) to Bitcoin values.
Two-way pegs require miners and exchanges to cooperate (what if they don't). Specifically exchanging RSK to Bitcoin requires such cooperation, in addition to storing the locked Bitcoins safely.
Merged mining means the Bitcoin miners can perform a 51% attack on it, just like has happened in the past on other merge mined alt-coins.
It doesn't solve the original problem why the miners did not want a larger blocksize on Bitcoin, which is that they need to store it all. Now they still need to store it all if they want Rootstock transaction fees for blocks.
How does this relate to the lightning network? The whitepaper mentions that RSK transactions are only small references to Bitcoin transactions so I guess they could perhaps be incremental lightning network spends? Does RSK require SegWit?
I guess all this complexity and a totally new technology becomes an alternative to simply exchanging the Bitcoins to Ethereum and doing all the use cases there. The difference would be that RSK keeps Bitcoin value afloat and transactions are in Bitcoin amounts. In addition it might be that RSK virtual machine is a bit more efficient compared to Ethereum and there might be a difference in transaction processing efficiency and fees. However, RSK lacks PoS, and is not available today already like Ethereum is. In addition a new codebase likely has bugs and issues that increase risks for early adopters.
The whitepaper mentions that Rootstock contract code will be opcode compatible with Ethereum, but it does not say anything about gas or a similar solution to pay for the contract execution. I wonder how they are planning to pay for executing the contract code.
Edit 2:
From FAQ is is evident they are using gas, probably with the same cost factors as Ethereum.

If a miner can choose whether to mine Bitcoins where one gets mining rewards and huge, inflated transaction fees, and RSK, where they only get transaction fees, why would they mine RSK?
The competition would drive miners to use about as much energy on mining as the profit enables. So RSK network would have a tiny total hashpower compared to Bitcoin and if the same hardware can be used in mining both, a Bitcoin miner can easily perform a 51% attack on RSK.
Even if the hardware required is different, the security of RSK becomes the bottleneck on Bitcoin security as they are pegged together. It is a lot cheaper to attack RSK than Bitcoin, but the result is the same. Invalidated transactions after the value has been exchanged into Bitcoin makes double spending possible.
What if the miners refuse to exchange RSK to Bitcoin 1-to-1? They might only allow such exchanges if a large part of the value is given to them as a transaction fee. Exchanges might also refuse to do 1-to-1 exchange if they perceive the value of one of the currencies to be higher. Is there a game theoretic analysis showing that 1-to-1 consensus peg can hold?
Do people really believe in RSK enough to exchange their Bitcoins into it? What if there will be RSK2 on top of RSK, on a sidechain of a sidechain, and ASK with a dynamic peg and mining rewards and BSK where the consensus is based on ICO and PoS?
