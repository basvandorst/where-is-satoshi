Theres bike and vehicular insurance. BTC has none. Risk has varying degrees and I would rate BTC as high. High risk also equals high reward so good luck and sell when you’re up

Just bought $4000 in sears stock ! Can’t wait for my pay day. Mostly joking but good luck . Making the point that this is a risky gamble rather than an investment. That said , it could go up again in the next decade even higher. No one could say for certain

Yeah but BTC doesn’t have an army and isn’t a police state ? All I’m saying is for better or worse it’ll be hard to topple the dollar

Another useless metric

Hedge your bets against US dollar with gold , diamonds , water rich land , and guns , not a crypto currency that could be gone tomorrow if satoshi decides to cash out

You didn’t realize any gains when your highly speculative investment saw 1500% returns in a year and dwarfed your IRA savings ?

Bro you don’t know shit .  You know Satoshi and got some insider info? Also can you tell me with your crystal ball if the s&amp;p is going to 2900 or 2000 next year cause I’ve been laboring over the clues I have but I can barely say one way or the other with 60% confidence . Honestly man bitcoin bulls are a special breed of dumb

I mean good on you for sticking to that .. and looks like you’ll be fine either way. I want to buy some crypto down the road to be 5-10% my net. Personally I see it as more of a hedge to the dollar , prolly woulda realized 500k in 2017 and let the hundo ride , but good luck . It’ll either be 100k or 100 by 2030, hope it moons

The whales control the value of the coin , not your wet dreams man . I wouldn’t be so trusting of anonymous  billionaires if I were you

I prefer a currency that deflates 80% in a year
