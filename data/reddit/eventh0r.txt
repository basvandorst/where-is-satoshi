Are either US citizens?

Shocking, and who could have seen this coming with AP releases yesterday that the Bitcoin.com "CTO" sold all of his bitcoin yesterday. It was propagated everywhere. Nothing to see here, move along...

Bcasher's solution to solving scaling is literally adding a multiplier coefficient to a line of code. That should tell any reasonable person how dumb Ver's minions are for believing him. They'll get exactly what they deserve. Litecoin already accomplished what bcash is trying to do.

Isn't the answer just to make the blocks smaller, decentralize the mining pool, and make miners less influential? They can spam tiny blocks all they want.

I agree with this, my only point is that fees or alternate tech, in the form of sidechains or something else, will become necessary for either flavor to solve micropayments, fast transactions, and POW incentives.
Also, the 21 million hard cap on coins is getting here much faster for BCH which will necessitate broad, mainstream adoption, rather quickly, to fund POW, while BTC, with the position it is a store of value, does not face the same time pressure. I think this is a very large obstacle for BCH as infrastructure takes a long time to build out and is very expensive, especially when competing against the embedded status quo.

This assumes datacenter tech remains constant, which is will not. There are some really interesting projects in the hosting space that can greatly increase speed and capacity by orders of magnitude. I have no problem with server farms being primary hubs for processing/mining transactions, but I have huge problems with mining outfits being centralized geographically as it's imperative that hash power becomes distributed.

Question on fees. Aren't higher fees on Bitcoin necessary the fund the cost of securing the network? And if Market Cap defines the value of the network, shouldn't fees naturally increase to ensure value is secured?
BCH is touting lower fees, but they also manufactured high inflation, which is good for the short-term price, but very bad for the long-term. It seems to be BTC is playing the long game and BCH is playing the short game. BCH fees are already too high to facilitate micropayments. Am I missing something here? Off-chain scaling, SW + LN, or some other variant, seems to be the only answer for either system, but only BTC actually has a development ecosystem. On the BCH side, you can identify 1 developer, none of the other "developers" are even named.

Sounds like a contracted inside job to me. Perfect cover for a Ponzi scheme.

There is an interesting follow up video to that where Ver says he owns just as much BCH and he does BTC. The date of that video was in July. This is troubling, and also the problem I have with contentious hard forks. The hard fork primarily benefits those with a lot of Bitcoin, so much so, they hoard it and just ride the appreciation in value.
This is a small pool of people, the early adopters, who have no skin in the game regarding who wins, because they win no matter what. Uncertainty is a feature to them. Consensus is irrelevant. 
Using collusion, leverage, and self-serving propaganda, they can manipulate markets to accumulate even more of any coin they want. The consequences affect financially weak, ignorant, and desperate people (often young people).
I truly believe Roger wants to grow crypto but it's also very clear that he wants it on his terms and to his benefit (which makes perfect sense) the only problem being he's rigging the game and using other people's money to do it, which is not cool. One need go no farther than his "Satoshi's Vision" bullcrap propaganda talking point to know he targeting dumb people.

Bitcoin needs to be able to withstand all types of attacks, otherwise, it's worthless. The Core team set it up correctly, the incentives are aligned. It's a trustless, self-regulating system. If it can't handle an attack from a very small number of people, then it needs to fail. My guess is that the miners are just using these tactics to extract BTC from greedy, emotional people. It's too big to even be an exit scam at this point. No way to get that much money out.

Their is no debate on that. Both sides have proposed ways of accomplishing lower fees. The variable is timeframe. The debate is about the value of consensus versus the costs of centralization. Look how easy it is to identify Bitcoin Core developers versus how difficult it is to identify Bitcoin Cash developers. For Bitcoin Cash I can see 1 guy, everyone else is referred to as "multiple teams of individual developers". Clearly these "independent teams" are centralizing forces, otherwise, they'd name them and we'd see open peer review. Sometimes you need to look at what isn't there, rather than what is to see what is going on.

Sounds like someone broke their NDA.

Thus the "(which makes perfect sense)" part of my post. It's a good test of whether or not math and free-market economics can govern or if crypto is just a failed experiment. Roger has checkmated BTC no matter what since he's playing with house money. Of course, if crypto fails due to bad actors, governments are going to be looking for someone to nail to a cross as an example...
