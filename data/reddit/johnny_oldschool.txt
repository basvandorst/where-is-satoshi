Thank you. I was unfamiliar with that term. :) 
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:38:05
Thank you for one of the few real answers. I appreciate it. :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:19:53
Alright, that was actually pretty funny. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:38:18
*laughs* Well then!
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:34:01
Which is.....?
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:50:58
Alright, let me just sift through hundreds of comments here. In the meantime, when people publicly ask a question, here's generally what is going through their minds. "Hmm, I haven't been able to find the information I want yet. Maybe if I ask for it, there will be someone who has already gone through the same process I have, and will know the answer, saving me time and energy."|
Society would sort of revert back to the dark ages if we all decided to start hoarding knowledge from each other. You know, kinda like what the church and monarchy did during the dark ages...
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:44:28
That seems to go for most any internet community. When your average person gains a little bit of knowledge that's uncommon, suddenly they decide it's time to act like the people who treated them poorly in highschool. I generally ignore it. Their own life is punishment enough for how they treat others.

Reddit has a search function? And to think that after all these years, I never thought to move my gaze slightly to the right and see what was there. No wonder I get in so many traffic accidents.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:37:11
Maybe because they're not exactly sure what they're searching for. How about that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:00:33
I don't really see the DogeCoin subreddit as being full of "propaganda". To me it just looks like regular people having fun. Mostly they seem like average joes who like the silly meme and have fun with it, and I really have no problem with that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:23:32
Hmm. That would lend even more credence to the theory that it's trumped up propaganda. I've seen many articles touting her directly as the "CEO of Bitcoin", which is of course ridiculous, as BitCoin is a protocol, not a corporation.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:50:53
If there were anyone in the gaming industry to take a look at BitCoin, it'd be Gabe. 
Or maybe Notch.
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:26:42
I use  You usually have to pay about a ten dollar fee on top of the current BTC price. I just go down to my local CIBC branch and make the deposit into the account that was sent to me by email, and my coins are usually in my wallet by the end of the day. 
I know it probably sounds a little sketchy to deposit money into an account like that, but I've done it three times with no issues so far.

Twas a snowy morn in Canada
Young Johnny cracked his eyes
As he peered across his coffee
Watching BitCoin's value rise
"All I own's a single Coin" he said
With underlying regret
"Kinda wish I'd caught on sooner"
"This could change the world I bet"
While he's never been a rich man
And spent most his life a poor
There's a single thing he's good at:
Being an entertainment whore
"Eat this moldy piece of bread you say?"
"And you'll give me five bucks?"
"Well, the cash and drunken laughter"
"Will outweigh how much it sucks."
And so here I am on Reddit
Watching snow pile up outside
In this frozen country Canada
Enjoying the BitCoin ride
I may not win the prize you've set
My efforts being in vain
But to quote the hero Maximus,
"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
In conclusion, fuck Canada.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:03:21
I agree, especially since that listing was about 2800 bucks last night. I've been following the postings for the BF miners on ebay, and between yesterday and today, most of them jumped in price by over ten grand.
Suspicious to say the least.

I heard a statistic from a documentary once saying that 70% of people incarcerated in the US for identity theft and fraud came over from Nigeria. Very strange.
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:05:01
I've just been using the wavy word tonight and it seemed to work fine for me. Maybe it's different for some people for some strange reason? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:33:01
Dude, it's just the natural ebb and flow of any online community. We're the ones who decide how we interpret our reality. You can chose to focus on the bullshit, or ignore it. And yeah, it can get annoying, but it doesn't mean you gotta throw the baby out with the bath water. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:59:04
99% of everyone in the world is an idiot. Therefore, anything popular sucks, and anything which is cool and becomes popular will inevitably end up sucking.
Pop music is a great example for the former, and first person shooters are a great example of the latter. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:02
Well, one BitCoin is trading at 145 USD right now. It fell pretty hard today, but a hundred and forty five bucks is still more than I can make in an 8 hour shift, so for me, I can't really consider it being "over". I think that there's probably just some greedy assholes out there who are trying to exploit the system to get rich. I can't really blame them I guess, I'd just hope that someday they can understand that money isn't what is bringing them contentment. 
Yeah yeah, I sound like a fucking hippy douche. I know. But my original offer still stands here regardless of whether the prices are falling.
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:53:41
I hope you mean it when you say you intend to do good with your coins. Start a business, or invest it, but please, for the love of god, don't let us see a picture of you driving a BMW surface next week. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:21:55
It always blows my mind the amount of money people have. With 50 grand, I could live a comfortable life for three years without having to work. Maybe I'm just a man of simple things, but the most money I've ever had in one place was $1400. I couldn't even fathom investing 50 grand in anything.
That said though, why the hell not. I mean, it's just money. At worst, you'll lose it. But at best, you'll gain a lot. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:42:35
Call me a geek, but the idea of a hardware BitCoin wallet is quite possibly the coolest thing in the world.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:15:01
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:41:27
That's a pretty good start. And heck, next time you're walking around the city, if you see some old guy pushing a shopping cart full of empty bottles, ask him if he's hungry and buy him a meal at some crappy diner or something. It's not gonna change his situation, but he'll probably hate his life a little less that day.
As for something longer lasting, maybe that will depend on where you live. I live in Calgary, Canada, and my city get's pretty damn cold. I've seen a few guys walking around who I know for a fact have been freezing their asses off. I'll be wearing 4 layers and shivering like a pussy, and then I see someone in a dirty T-shirt and a hoodie, and suddenly realize just how good I have it. (And let me tell you, I got pretty much nothing going for me other than my jacket!) 
But since I moved here, I've wanted to try to start up some sort of charity that buys these poor fucks some decently warm clothing. If you live in a city that has cold winters, maybe that could be something to look into.
If it were me, I'd probably avoid simply donating to an existing charity. If you have the funds and compassion to start something new, there's nothing stopping you from doing it.
If you do come up with something, I'd love for you to post here frequently and let us all know how it's progressing. But I'll give you something that I hold myself to whenever I try to do something good for someone else: remain as anonymous as possible. Some people help others so that they will be seen as a "good" person within their circles. They really don't care about other people, they only care about themselves. They will donate to a charity, but really, they're just paying to boost their own fragile self image. You can always be sure that you're doing something good for someone else when you do it in secret. That's the definition of a selfless act. 
I'll give you an example, in the traditional Canadian fashion: Hockey. 
There's two players on the Vancouver team that are pretty popular, known as the Sedin twins. They donated a million bucks to the Children's Hospital. But there's only one reason why we know about this. The Children's Hospital convinced them to let them run a news piece about it, because they felt it would be an inspiration for more people to donate. And they were right. But at the beginning, the Sedin twins strongly requested that their donation remain unpublished. And I think that's a good example of the difference between people who give because it's a good thing to do, and people who give because they want everyone to know what a "wonderful" and "generous" person they are. It's the difference between a selfish act, and a selfless one, and only the latter actually contributes to making the world a better place.

I love how they say "real money" vs "virtual currency". Please explain to me how a physical piece of paper with a number on it backed by nothing is "real". My BitCoins exist on my computer hard drive, and I can physically touch my computer. That makes them at least as real as the paper money in my back pocket.

Why will there be no incentive? You still have to enter in half of the Captcha code. And the sites still require you to wait on them for a predetermined amount of time. All it does is take the two seconds you spend to type in the Captcha and reduces it to one second.
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:45:24
Holy crap, over 90??? I'm taking my 0.02 BitCoins and going STRAIGHT to SatoshiDice!

Wow, that is some crazy anger man. Where did that come from?

There is no coin. Soon you'll see, that it is not the Coin that bends, it is only ourselves.

That's actually a fantastic idea. I think I'll do that tomorrow morning over my cup of coffee.

Only difference between me and a whore is that I receive far fewer pimp slaps on a daily basis, and I don't have to worry about strange fungal infections on my genitalia. For now.

I think the important thing to consider here is who exactly did this, and why.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:35:46
Of course it was. Our entire society is pretty much based off of fucking over someone else to get ahead. Maybe we're going to grow past that someday. Personally, I remain optimistic, while also remaining cautious and realistic. Anything less is just sort of depressing. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:04:02
Well, by free "BitCoin", I mean free "BitCents". And by free "BitCents", I mean...really not enough to make it worth your time. But hey, some people like me have multiple monitors and a short attention span.

@_date: 2013-04-03 08:59:16
Nah, just been a bit of a rough life for me. But I'm happy with what I have, and I'm very careful with it. I guess my only point was that money really isn't what determines whether a person enjoys their life or not, because I'm a very happy person who has very little, and I see many people with a lot who don't seem very happy. 
Now let's all put daisies in our hair and dance like filthy hippies. :D

I'm an average man who knows average people, and all of us like to think we're smarter than we really are. This is simply what I've come across and how I've responded. Mostly satire based on conversations with friends.

Well, they're quite obviously scared now aren't they.

Tough call. Goku is one of the most powerful being in the universe, but he's also a real softy. They'd probably end up boring each other to death with politeness, resulting in a draw.

Step 1.) Cancel cable television
Step 2.) Buy BitCoins
Step 3.) ?????
Step 4.) Profit
