as long as you manage your expectations and understand that the most likely scenario is you losing the money, and the unlikely one is that you "win the jackpot", it is not a bad idea.

Market cap in coinmarket cap is not total supply x price, rather CIRCULATING supply x price. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:41:17
agreed, and I think for all other coins it is an overestimate as well, in particular older coins (eg. litecoin, bytecoin, dogecoin, etc.) Overall that might mean total market cap is a few million euros lower, which is great to know.

the thing is that bitstamp doesnt have to "pay" anything: they just connect a buyer with a seller. Unless there is fraud (or fractional reserves), the FIAT from the buyer should pay the BTC of seller. Bitsamp makes money on fees and provides money remittance service.

Very black or white view of the world. Scaling is.not a "all or nothing" decision. The 2mb + segwit would have been a good compromise by allowing some immediate scaling but not enough. But now we hear bullshit like "btc is digital gold it doesn't have to be a currency" lol what kind of idiot believes that is a good plan?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:00:45
Segwit does not resolve the issue.

Regardless of the personal context of each of us (eg. Debts to pay) there is only one smart way to buy Bitcoin: for long term. Anyone doing it for short term "get rich quick" can get burned.
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:51:36
have you really been in this market for years? As in more than 2 years? And you think now is the time to sell? When noone talked about bitcoin, no press, no media, only darknetmarkets and some cyberpunks you thought it was good to keep, now with all the mainstream attention and institutional money you think it is the right time to sell?
Cant understand it.

You should check history of monetary systems if you think "interest" has anything to do with it. Let me exemplify:
- Portuguese sailors found tribes in Africa using glass beads as money.
- Africans loved the beads, wanted to trade anything for it.
- Africans couldn't care less for gold.
- Portuguese brought boat-loads of glass beads and traded everything they wanted for it.
- slowly but steadily beads started to experience inflation until they collapsed to the form of harder money: gold.
- gold became the standard.
Same here: we just need to wait for fiat to continue being printed without control, more quantitative easing from central banks, more incentives, etc. Slowly but steadily inflation will eat away the value and the new form of harder money will win: bitcoin.

Life is a marathon, not a Sprint. There are 2 types of people here: the ones that get it (5%?) and the ones who are trying to time the price and make a profit. If you understood, and if you expect to live another 20+ years,  you would be begging for the price to go to 50$ so you could buy more. 
these down turns are exactly why it isn't easy to do well in the long term: only very strong minded people hold through 80% downturns. 
Time will tell who was right. Let's check again in 8 years. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:48:42
2 main reasons:
- I saw = I experienced It, not that I forecasted it. ;
- there was no (straightforward) possibility to short bitcoin, specially with 10x leverage. If I'm not mistaken the "turn-key" solutions for that appeared late 2016.
1 smaller reason: making money and greed is not what I'm about. I'm lucky to have a fulfilling and decently paid job and I don't have a ego that requires huge wealth to satisfy. This is about monetary policy change and, with it, the creation of a more fair world.

Not every application benefits from decentralization / blockchain based development. I do not agree web 3.0 is what this article advocates.

lol man I used the internet in 95 and remember how a picture would take 3 min to load and would render one horizontal line at a time. It was obviously slow, you did not need to experience anything else to come to that conclusion
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:33:34
Indeed i am "crazy", I take decisions with my money that most people wouldn't. That is mostly because I learned to think for myself, rather than think my decisions are good if price goes up and bad if price goes down. Time will tell who is right, even though I have an unfair advantage: I saw the 2 last downturns and have learned thorough personal experience that only  1 of 2 things can happen: either the blockchain stops working and btc is worth 0€; or miners continue to process and the price eventually goes up. Let's find out :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:32:53
Thanks for your work, i personally really appreciate it. Can you elaborate further why 2mb blocks would hurt censorship resistance? 
Edit: reading through one of your links regarding 4mb blocks, it seems to support the view that 2mb would be fine... wouldn't this have brought some short term relief while mid term solution with LN is worked upon?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:53


Might be. And that is good. Let me elaborate: 
**Bitcoin needs to be able to endure attacks from powerful actors**: nation-states, central banks, eventually armed men, etc. These small current attacks are useful to "stress the system", highlighting a couple of vulnerabilities, and giving us the opportunity to improve upon them. 
**Our thinking should be "How can we improve bitcoin to make it more resilient to this?"** Logical ideas: Maybe a marketing budget similar to Dash; maybe a different governance scheme for more coesion on community; etc. 
Stupid ideas: trying to rename the coin, and continuously insulting their supporters. 
Why is it stupid?
It leads no where: for sure they will not change the name, and having half the places calling it X and half calling it Y just increases confusion! 
Example of noob: "Oh I want to avoid buying Bcash, where can I find the real bitcoin? Oh here it is, "Bitcoin cash" let me buy it". 
Having 2 names is worse than letting them keep calling it bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:28:01
lol this kind of thinking is exactly why we are in the mess we are. Attacking other coins instead of focusing on solving bitcoin problems is utterly useless. Just 1 min thinking about "retaliation" is a total waste of time. Think about how to scale, increase transaction speed, capacity and reduce fees. The rest will take care of itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:42:56
Yeah I know this view, I personally don't buy it at all. I get that bigger blocks is not a long term solution. But that is not incompatible with 2mb being totally acceptable for now without centralization effect. This would give us maybe 1 or 2 years of cheaper fees while LN gets developed. Anyway that ship has sailed, screw it, no point arguing about it now

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:30:10
really interesting question, but I lack in-depth knowledge to give an insightful answer. My non-tecnical opinion is that it looks promising, but we will really only know when there is a full deployment, and we can assess how it works with big volume of transactions.
I thought the 2x option would have been a good compromise to allow some scalability while LN is worked upon, I am not sure why everyone hated 2x so much - if we had done it I think bitcoin cash wouldn't be where it is today.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:59
Man who cares? Really, think deep about this, who cares if you call it bcash or btrash or bitcoin cash or bitcoin fuckyou, etc? 
You know how you solve market confusion? By improving bitcoin, reducing backlog and fees, getting its market cap to be 100x Bitcoin cash.
Everyone going around fighting with the flavour of the month coin - ETH, BCH, LTC, whatever - is just distracting the community from the bigger picture at play. 
Stay focused, stay true to the vision, everything else will come.

it dropped 300% huh? that is impressive, always assumed it cannot lose more than 100% of the value, but well, you did all the math so cant be wrong right?

Yeah someone's feeling did get hurt indeed, the ones from the guy who just got his ass handed to him

Thanks man I appreciate your admission of being wrong now that you were  proven incorrect. And let me tell you I feel terrible about what happened in your childhood, for you to compare this situation to kindergarden it becomes obvious that you also got your ass handed to you often in kindergarden. Sorry about that man, bullying is no joke, hope one day you get over it.

Ice cream here. Cannot confirm, under confidential proceedings due to involvement with minors
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:20:37
Yeah I think you might be messing something up
The right way to calculate is : (1 - 6.8/20) = 1 - 0.34 = 0.66 = 66%.
The price decreased 66% and not 300%, you see?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:49:31

You're clearly a fanatic who disregards reason when you say bitcoin is the fastest payment method in the world. Bye

Lol, man stop kidding yourself and lowering the intended performance bar just to pat yourself in the back that bitcoin is great.
Obviously 10h transaction time is too high for mainstream adoption, and mainstream adoption is needed to ensure long term stable survival.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:40:58
So just to be clear:
- you say bitcoin is today the fastest payment method. 
- therefore bitcoin is faster than handing someone a 10 dollar bill?
