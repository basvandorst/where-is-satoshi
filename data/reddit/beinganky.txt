news visuals were making them look like goons, as if they have done something wrong.  :/  Our government is seriously deaf and illiterate.

Middle class men. Poor has nothing to loose, Rich has a-lot of money to shut mouths down.
I hope they do not create a mess out of crypto now.

In my country: They don't understand what crypto is and they don't want to. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:12:22
yes but 10$ is a very small amount. I have used zebpay, its minimum order value is 100$ :/
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:33:49
wait for some time. like 2 days.   then raise a ticket
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:09:56
