So what is the natural reaction - change your password! And what happens when you do that? - Withdrawals disabled for 24 hours... Gox is buying time everywhere they can.

Well done to the Kraken team! You've done an excellent job on the usability of the site.
Maybe spend some of your new cash on speeding up support a bit.

Anonymous website with a handful of pages without any company information other than the city its located in...I'm not convinced.

It's been like this for almost 24 hours...

Pretty good summary based on what little information is currently available.

"backing up" since when? Wasn't he last seen only a few days ago? Just curious.

This is great news...in the long run. Thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people will hear about bitcoin for the first time tomorrow. Maybe in a few months time, they'll open an account, then eventually buy some bitcoin. This ultimately brings bitcoin closer to becoming a viable everyday currency.

These sites are encountering some serious trade volume right now. I'm sure it's only momentary. 
Same happened with coinbase earlier and they're back.

I made a 'test' withdrawal from mt gox before they suspended withdrawals, for 0.01BTC. After this went through, I withdrew the much larger balance in my amount. Goes without saying, all I ever got from gox was 0.01BTC.

On 2/4/14, literally a few days before withdrawals were suspended, I did a 'test' withdrawal for 0.001 (successfully). After it going through successfully the next day, I tried to do a real withdrawal with my actual balance... Sufficed to say it didn't make it, and is gone now. HEY AT LEAST I GOT 0.001 BTC OUT YAY.
