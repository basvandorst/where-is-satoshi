I'm not sure how they can ban thousands of merchants, hundreds of companies and exchanges along with millions of users from using bitcoin and even if they did,they can't stop people from selling their coins outside america or for cash in america.

I've been trading bitcoins on localbitcoins from past 4 years and I would like to tell you that locabitcoins is a safe and secure site but you need to know how escrow on localbitcoins works. If you are buying bitcoins online, you should find a seller that have aleast 500 trades completed with 100% feedback, Always communicate through localbitcoins trading page for more safety and do not forget to "mark payment as completed" once you have paid him. Please check buying guide for more details.

Yeah man, those were good days. I was trading on gox when prices were just 0.10$. I have that screenshot too somewhere.

You can't compare gavin with flappybird coder.  Flappybird earned that money via ad's and other different methods. He didn't asked anyone to donate money nor he asked for a salary. Whatever gavin did was a voluntary work (No one forced him) and he is getting paid. Do you really think his only way of earning is through bitcoin foundation? 
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:05:58
The Core of bitcoin foundation is fucked up.
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:03:03
