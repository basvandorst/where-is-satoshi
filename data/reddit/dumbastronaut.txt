A nice week of volatility leading up to an hourglass that will either tank or surge when it tests the all time high is what i'm preparing for.. I'm thinking the former
@_date: 2013-02-28 08:01:13
$3.74 and we have a deal

I haven't been this excited since QE 1 and 2

I disagree. The more people know the better..

That same website has a forex school with a section dedicated to fibonacci and other techical indicators 
@_date: 2013-02-01 02:40:32
This is awesome, it's going to make shit ton of people find out about BTC. Imagine that along with today's rally.. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 02:53:03
I pledge as well 
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:49:57
link your bank account and buy.
They are always running out of bitcoins though so not always reliable

I'm in no way affiliated with them, I just saw the website and asked a simple question about them. I too, thought the same and hadn't done my due diligence yet. So I apologize if you perceive this as spam
@_date: 2013-02-19 05:49:44
I dig your style
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:26:13
This is very true. Sometimes people get blind with ambition and it's never a bad idea to have different views collaborating 
@_date: 2013-07-04 00:44:51
this game looks fucking awesome
