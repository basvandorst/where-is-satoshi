Didn't find a PS4. Darn.

Don't panic sell. Ride it out and buy when it dips. Buy fractions of a coin if you have to.

It's completely possible. The problem is that nobody can predict it right now. The best thing you can do is just be watchful of the tracker ( and if it dips jump on it and try to snag some coins (be quick about it too). 
Again, if you can't afford a whole coin (I certainly can't at this point) then just buy fractions of a coin and play the market (buy when it dips and hold when it rises).

Most likely but also probably not.

I like how after he said that the dude was all "Alright lets get to the real experts..." 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:20:33
Yeah can somebody explain what just happened? Was watching bitstamp and bitcoinity. Dropped to $690 and didn't refresh for a a few minutes then shot back up to $720

mouth breathers.

Start here:

It's a risk to wait. Buy fractions now and larger amounts when it dips. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:56:18
I can respect this point of view. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:35:11
Pointless? Hardly. The silkroad is not a legitimate and honest business. I fully expect and hope the next silk road to be shut down as well. 
Bad actors can only tarnish the good that can come from bitcoin.

How do people have money to just do this. Kills me.

Gox price fluctuates insanely fast and sporadic. It should let you lock in on a set price.

We can argue about the "alleged" assassination all day, but there's no arguing the child pornography and drug paraphernalia.

Got my saw out. Ready to relinquish myself of an arm incase it drops under $100. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:25:38
I payed the $4.99 to use that feature (kinda lame). 
The only thing I would warn you about is that for some reason I can't just set it to warn me at whatever price I feel like. It has a set range. So right now the price $735, I can only set it to warn me when it drops below $610. If the price were to go higher so would the minimum of what I can tell it to notify me. Does that make sense? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:48:43
Which was good.

TIL Ruling assassination as illegal is considered prissy, antique morality, self righteous, political correctness.

Some people need advice. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:29:50
Yep! looks like it's going down as we speak. Multiple trackers open right now, all of them are plummeting. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:28
I saw it on bitstamp as well! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:25:34
It's out of control. I'm just sitting here watching the tracker rise and rise and rise to around $800 - $900 and then a HUGE drop to $690 and then bounces up again. Amazing. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:35:47
If you can't afford the whole coin, get a half coin. You don't have to purchase an entire coin. I've only got fractions. Just be patient, invest what you can afford and be watchful of the market value. Buy when it dips. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:11:01
Me too buddy. It's completely unpredictable at this stage though. Just stay glued to a tracker. I use an app called btcReport and I have it set to send me notifcations when the price goes above or below a certain amount. unfortunately when it gave me notifications that the price dropped below $500 I was dead asleep. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:25:51
Came here to comment on the same thing. You notice the sudden drop right after hitting $799. People started selling coins like they were going out of style. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:33:07
You don't have to buy a whole coin. I don't have bags of money laying around waiting to drop a couple thousand at any given moment, so I've simply invested what I can. Maybe eventually I'll own a whole coin but right now it's about patience and paying attention to the market value.
