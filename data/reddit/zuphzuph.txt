These journalists normally don't care about what content they post or who they hurt. Same goes for the editors that review their work. Journalists are some of the worst scum on the net. Content is often one sided and opinionated. Do yourself a favor and get a job that doesn't require you spreading pieces of information about other people's private lives. That or just get a life in general Leah...

Dish should stand in front of a mirror and light themselves on fire. Terrible company hoping to rebound instead of going bankrupt. This is hilarious.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:56:47
Yeah they are scamming all of you again. Wake the fuck up @_date: 2014-02-20 13:23:34
Coming for you mark. Watch your fucking asshole. Your my new bitch.
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:15:35
and boom.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:20:14
Yeah if you buy right now I think your boss should start paying you for your own stupidity. Just saying...
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:04:00
How are they losing customers to customers? This makes no logical sense. Cable and satellite providers are ISPs...
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:54:42
You sexy piece of ass...
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:16:31
Mt. Gox can blow my cock every time I buy from them. Because you see what else can I get from them if I throw them some cash and can't get it out. Blow job gox? how about 150 per?
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:23:40
Seems like too much of a "gamble"
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:13:55
Mt. Gox will fuck you harder than a hooker on blow. The exchange needs to close its door and stop lying to us.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:18:57
Done fuck mt. Gox and the damage they've caused us all. As a miner I hope these guys get the fuck out.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:10:15
They are going downhill and have been doing so for the past 5 to 7 now. They're prob borderline bankrupt right now...
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:36:23
I have a neck beard and I find this laughable. Audi, house and a good miner. Check check and check. Bird is the?
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:40:17
What if bitcoin is just a ponzi scheme and the inside job has you all running around like rabbits? Maybe the media gets a laugh about how worked up you all get... Maybe JPM owns and wrote the original bitcoin protocol? Mind blown?
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:54:53
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:54:35
They why don't you take the horse by the reigns and make it happen for yourself?
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:50:03
I had a typo. My point was that Netflix comes on bluray and TVs aswell. The bandwidth cap is in the process of being removed as we speak. I value the speed and consistency of cable. I also understand that satellite is suitable for remote locations and places without ground wiring. Just stating my opinion on this.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:31:01
This is untrue. Businesses in Denver have been accepting for months now...
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:09:25
Mt. Gox needs to close. The market is completely fucked if they don't... This is all just a dream... Crypto is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:33:35
lol Moto got sold.... read up.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:25:51
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:08:40
I like my cable connection...
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:52:05
They're going bankrupt just like overstock. They expect crypto miners and traders to use their sites out of convenience. Dish is going down the shitter. I'm an IT guy and I'd never even sit down with them for an interview. They're fucked and see this as a last resort. Quote me 6 months from now... :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:10:25
Mt. Gox is full of liars and scammers good luck getting any of your money back. That is all.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:37:14
Thanks for adding book!
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:16:35
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:52:47
And I think those of you who keep supporting gox are retards. They could be just accepting your money for free while they flip the btc on other exchanges. Is this concept so hard to understand?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:15:23
How about instead of behind a bunch of power hungry attention whores you fuck tards in DC give the people some power for once and get off your high horse. I know you guys watch me take my morning shit via satellite every morning... Aka right now... I think he's mad about behind too old to use a computer. You politicians are just a bunch of fake humans with comedic backgrounds obviously. I can't wait to get out of this country and take my btc with me... I'm 23 and smart enough to know my life has pretty much resulted in a means of slavery. Work the 8 to 5 pay the bills and repeat. I think Mr politician here is quite comfortable with the shady lifestyle he's chosen like many others.
America is angry and I'm pretty sure this would push many over the edge...
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:50:44
Took you long enough. Nexus 5 unlocked for 350 from Google play just FYI.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:22:43
Wanna "get fucked?" Buy mt. Gox today. Seriously? Let's sue the fuck out of Gox. With what I've made on crypto I'll hire a lawyer. Just wanna see the exploiter s get fucked for fucking everyone else.
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:04:39
Lol glad to know they're willing to gamble on value...
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:41:00
I love you early am trolls... Muahahaha
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:58:55
Just the normal negative media. Why so you think he's a journalist? Obviously he has no talent outside of asking questions... I don't know how these types of individuals sleep at night. Obviously, he didn't understand anything about bitcoin and/or how it works. Any chance you wanna share his number? We could do a story on him. :)
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:35:43
Because there is always a probability of being hacked if that data isn't in cold storage. With as safe as we like to think encryption is there are multiple ways hackers can get online account info. Exchanges have been hacked in the past numerous times throughout the development and history of crypto.
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:20:15
They should I say this because I have some. :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:20:40
How does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine apple?
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:45:10
Lolz fuck apple. Open source ftw.
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:12:50
So you're a glorified photographer? Learn coding languages and maybe then this would be a successful scam.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:56:05
Those are some sad saggy tits. Gox is dead give them free money... Dumbasses
