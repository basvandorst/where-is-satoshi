You don't actually need to close the channel to "get" the bitcoin. You are right from a blockchain perspective, but from a "bitcoin" perspective you already have these bitcoin and can send them to anyone who speaks lightning (this is instant if there is a route available between you and who you want to send them to).
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:40:33
Lightning works a bit differently: a lightning transaction is message between (at least) two parties. This message doesn't touch the blockchain (but it can be enforced on the blockchain at any time), so therefor it's very different from a bitcoin transaction that goes into the blockchain.

This is obviously false: you can right now download a client from 4 years ago and this client would adhere to the same protocol and agree with the current bitcoin network. The fact that this old client does not fully understand new added rules that are always followed by miners does not make it a different bitcoin. From day one it was dangerous to accept 0conf transactions, it still is.
The difference between a soft and a hardfork is huge. Bcash is a not bitcoin because it has different consensus rules than bitcoin (which it got through a hard fork), bitcoin (post segwit) has no rules that break compatibility with old clients. Which is why everyone (except people in call it bitcoin.

This is exactly the consensus problem Bitcoin is solving (in regards to proving coin ownership). And the solutions we currently have are PoW and PoS. I don't see how we can use those to get any consensus here.
Even if we could vote democratically, I personally don't think this should be a democratic decision at all. Most people do not understand the implications of different options (as well as the implications of a possible fork).

In the case of ghash, to double spend they have to make a different chain that forks away from the main chain (to reroute spends). Isn't it possible to write a script that connects to ghash as a miner and checks whether the work sent is for the main chain or not? Assuming a big portion of their hashing power comes from third party miners (and they send the same work to everyone).

Except that you can't in a decentral system like this. Disregarding the fact that mining blocks is similar to the lotto (eg. based on chance instead of rewards based on amount of work), pools / entities / evil geniuses / NSA would just put a new address in each mined block (or portray to be 10 entities at the same time and divide hashing over those). Also doesn't fix the problem that if there would be a monetary incentive multiple pools would just combine their hashing power and split the profits from double spending.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:38:56
You don't want any trust any single entity, only the network as a whole. The 51% problem is about a single entity getting to much control. If you put exchanges in charge (which would only work if exchanges were the only way to convert your bitcoin into other things of value, which it is not) you're basically back in the middle ages of credit card companies in a fully controlled system. A system which a government  / rogue employee / could manipulate through an exchange.


The way fees work is that if you send some BTC, you do not put a destination on the whole amount. When a miner puts the transaction in a block it basically points the small unpointed amount called the fee to itself (or to the pool, if it's mining for one). This way anyone can become a miner in a free market system.

I am saying that just like Bitcoin is an experiment so is Ethereum. Just as I don't trust **all my life savings** to Bitcoin I also don't trust that to Ethereum. But calling software sandboxes unsafe as an argument of why Ethereum is bad / a scam is total bs.

@_date: 2014-01-31 21:40:34
Good idea, though the problem right now is that I throttle the transactions: If multiple happen within the same second I only send one, main reasons are that I am not sure if my server can handle the load (currently almost 200 users online) and that we can't rotate the sphere extremely fast (feels glitchy). So adding all totals can't really happen now as the website does not receive all transactions.
I'll start thinking on how to do this more nicely.

This is in reach on a bootstrap budget if you go cloud. But the solution suggested is how everyone does things already (most probably) and leaves room for a lot of different attacks.
Also if you look at an exchange you should obv divide your infra over multiple machines but note that you can't shard a matching engine.
I really think it's better to let the security guys handle this kind of stuff. Traditional banks and financial services have been (pretty successfully) defending against online attacks for a long time.
TLDR: not really a new solution, also not a waterproof security plan. The problem lies in the fact that people with to little competency regarding these systems are building exchanges in a weekend.

Woah this is lame. Infosec is hard and you call everyone who does not dare to take on this risk personally lazy, greedy or dumb? Also many other reasons to keep your funds at an exchange (like for **trading it**, just because you are HODLING does not mean everyone wants to do this).

Well you can selfish mine blocks. When you measure that you are mining more blocks than the network you can: continue mining, spend coins, let the network confirm the transaction but don't confirm it in your own blocks, wait for x confirmations in the normal chain to get your money from the exchange, create a fork in the chain by publishing your blocks (which forms the longest chain). You now have your money and the coins.
But this is probably not what you want to do, check [this video](

The transaction is instant (a couple of sec), however an unconfirmed transaction is not equal to "transferring about 18-19M worth of Bitcoins".

it's not about hashrate, it's about found blocks. If I had 1% hashrate and an extreme amount of luck that caused me to mine 51% of the blocks I could successfully perform attacks.
But when trying to monitor actors because the system is at risk when a big actor does something bad, the last you want to do is believe the numbers provided by that actor.
EDIT: you do need a majority of hashing rate for some types of attacks (as luck will even out over time), though not for others (if you just want to double spend).

Miners don't have to say anything to the network, until they announce a new block. But if I mine a block in the US, I can just broadcast the block from a different location. Additionally you could have a 5PH mining operation behind a single node.

You can't get the exact number using math:
it's basically the same as a lotto system where you can never know how many tickets everyone bought. If after a lot of drawings player X wins 10% of the time, you could say he should have about 10% of the tickets (or he has 1% and is extremely lucky, because lotto drawings are random). This is how everyone calculates those numbers, but it doesn't calculate anything certain.
The big problem with this approach is that if you have more than 50% of the tickets one of the more nasty things you can do is selfish mining. With selfish mining you win the lotto every time but nobody knows it yet, **so this is not reflected in any charts** until you announce it. While winning it you are in control of the network (you get to decide who can and can't send coins). You could also double spend, act like a monopoly by raising the transaction fees, make sure no other miner gets any block rewards or whatever you want basically.
EDIT: this is the same as what said. **Someone who is one of the biggest authorities on this subject: When his pool (BTC Guild) was in [the same situation as ghash is now over a year ago]( He actively prevented the pool from getting bigger by raising fees and refusing new miners.** This is the kind of behaviour we need.

Smart people have been thinking about this for a long time, but it's a really hard problem. You can't really guard against big players in a system where everyone is pseudonyms (and multiple small players might be part of a big player).

Not possible to do if you want to keep bitcoin Pseudonyms. Big player could just pretend to be 10 small players (or 10 small players could just team up).
Also note that the monetary incentive to double spend does not have to be direct profit perse. If Bitcoin takes over consumer payment industries a lot of companies have a huge monetary incentive much larger than the profits from double spends to destabilise and kill trust. So even if you are able to limit the profits / power of someone with a huge portion of the network he might be able to kill all trust in the system.

Looking more closely at the API docs I only [see]( possibilities to watch addresses created with Coinbase itself. Using Coinbase for both simplifies a lot (managing keys, securing existing funds) and you also are already putting trust on Coinbase on letting you know about all payments.
If you want to split those up, I suggest blockchain.info's API where you can watch any address. So create them yourself on your server without any contact with the blockchain, and use blockchain.info to let you know once funds arrive. But this is just one small step behind doing everything yourself using your own node.

No what you said is that people with a MSc in Computer Science (should) know better than use a sandbox to make it secure.


I've read it, what I got out of it is that it is dangerous just as bitcoin is dangerous. But because I both see them as experiments at this point that does not bother me at all.
You keep on saying how dangerous sandboxes are. There is this big complex system, the biggest company has a stake of over 4 times the market cap of Bitcoin in it [1]. The whole system is build on the idea of selling sandboxes. The system is the cloud and the company is AWS (or Amazon), the sandboxes are virtual servers.

While you might be right, I have heard this argument (not specifically in a blocksize context) ever since I became involved with bitcoin ~4 years ago. And I have yet to see it really happen from a market point of view.
I think the main reason people are not jumping on something else is because truly knows where the most value lies (more privacy like monero or zcash, more utility like ethereum or simple faster confirmations like litecoin)..
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:22:13
Nothing is validating itself, pos systems don't have a consciousness. Cryptography is used to prove address ownership. Coin ownership (derived from address ownership) can be used as a vote for the consensus of the network towards transactions.
You on the other hand how do you know you even exist? Have you validated yourself? Something which can't be done, right?
EDIT: typo, english is not my mother tongue.
EDIT 2: the "proof" has nothing to do with (self) validation. It has to do with a method for determining what the global consensus should be, which is thereafter regarded as truth (and has thus been "proven" by the method of stake)

My tips: when everyone doing arb combined can only make exactly X BTC (the spread * the volume). Why would people give information away on how to do this for free? It would directly eat into their profit (or take everything away if the new guy is faster).
An arbitrage bot is one of the easiest to write and the one most people start with. It only becomes hard when you need to compete for speed because everyone else is faster.

There is no digital democracy. One wealthy guy can buy the majority of nodes/mining/volume/usage/legislation/etc.


From a market perspective this has happened hundreds of times: bitcoin has been forked into altcoins (codebase, not the chain). And now it's a free market! Use/hoard/spread FUD/trade whatever cryptocurrency you want. Heck you can just create your own coin (SatoshiRealistCoin).

No it's not. The big thing here being that a cryptocurrency works because you don't have to trust anyone (you can verify all transactions, the blockchain and all the code). This falls completely apart once nobody can verify the code that is supposed to do all other validations (transactions, blocks).
This is in the second sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper:


For BU a third party is required that publishes binaries that nobody can check. Currently BU is inherently not trustless. It's just a really slow version of paypal.

two things about miners:
- There incentives are misaligned with everyone else. They only want to make money and don't care about anything else.
- Just like most people, most miners don't understand and don't care about segwit (and even if they do, they have different incentives to everyone else, see above).


Not an expert, but you know things no one else knows?

They are not buying them for investment purposes, they are going to use them. The idea of money is that it represents wealth which people spend to buy goods (fruit rots after a week, flowers don't stay good for long either and people still buy them).


here is no perfect way to measure wealth.


No it's not, inflation means the devaluation of wealth. It has nothing to do with new money being printed. The same goes for gold:
Gold isn't always inflationary, even though we only ever mine more of it. According to your definition, gold inflation should also be measured in how much more is being mined ?
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:47:45
Yes it would be possible. But it would take away some of the securities of PoW in bitcoin:
In bitcoin there can be multiple chains, but the chain that has the "most" amount of work in it will be considered the most valid chain (and thus the "truth"). You can say something like:
Besides the amount of work in a chain we will also look at amount of transactions in the blocks.
But in this case miners could create transactions which they don't publish to the network but include in their own blocks, to mine blocks with less mining power (but more transactions). This would be free for miners since the transaction fees would always go to them (since no other miners know about the transactions).

Lots of trading firms are making money without betting on the price, they employ arbitrage (stat arb, normal arb, inter exchange arb, interest arb). They are market makers etc, sometimes exchanges pay them directly to provide liquidity.
The biggest traders in crypto are firms that employ these kind of strategies, firms like DRW Cumberland. And they all want to trade crypto markets (btc, eth, altcoins) without being exposed to the price. So they loan 10k bitcoin, trade with them, make 10% profit and pay the bitcoins (+interest) back. If bitcoin crashed 50% during this time they don't care since they simply pay back the same amount of bitcoins they loan.

What you are describing now is not:


@_date: 2017-03-29 12:14:36
I'm having some trouble explaining what I mean in english, I don't mean to troll. What I mean is:
When you mine, you hash (=sha256) a block. The result of this is a hash/digest. You can look at this hash in a number of ways, most block explorers/user facing APIs look at it in hexadecimal form like so: "000000000000000001c314f7b99739d7faf3fd05124497e207061452010eac7f" (which has a number of zeros in te beginning).
But consensus code interpets the hash as a big number (it might be stored in memory/on disk in binary, that doesn't matter here). It simply checks if the number is smaller than the target, it doesn't count any number of zeros.
Here is the [bitcoin wiki on it](

It seems like you are arguing more about the [definition]( than anything else:


But even though: the thing most people care about is about wealth: if I have 1000 dollars that represents a certain amount of wealth (I can buy a certain amount of food with this, or a laptop of a certain standards), what is my 1000 dollars going to be worth in the future (which is hard to measure since both food and laptop prices change).
This is measured in looking at the prices of certain products. And the big thing is that a lot of different factors have influence on this change in purchasing power (=inflation), money being printed plays just a tiny roll.

Quite the opposite because the value of money is decoupled from economic growth: your dollars are devaluing even if the economy is growing.


No obviously it shouldn't be measured through money creation, if an economy is prospering and that same amount of money is pumped into the system your dollar would be worth the same as it was yesterday (there now is more wealth than there was yesterday). The thing is that more money is always pumped in to cause inflation. Which leading economists believe is a good thing because it incentivises spending, investing, etc.

Consensus rules now tell us that if that happens the chain reorgs (just the BTU chain in this case), all tx in the old BTU chain will be purged from history.
That is until the BTU chain is longer again, which I think will very likely happen looking at the amount of money BU miners will throw at this problem (all their BU mine rewards will be undone if they don't act). Assuming they didn't sell those coins asap (which might have been the attack vector you were talking about).

"the number of zeros" is simply interpretation in hexadecimal. You can convert any big number to a string of hexadecimals. The smaller the number, the more leading zeros.

Those graphs show bitcoin nodes. The bitcoin network consists of nodes and miners, and they do very different things.
A 51% attack is something a miner can do, and it is about his hashpower compared to the rest of the miners.
EDIT: If the majority of bitcoin miners would jump to BU in case of a split, it would just mean there are now two "blockchains" with different rules and different "truths" (consensus). But the fear is that BU miners would have an incentive to destablise the non BU chain (making people jump to BU - making BU coins more valuable). They can do that by attacking the non BU chain (as described [here](

Most people don't run their own full node (which validates everything), but use an SPV client (lightweight software that  trusts a full node and thus does not need the full blockchain). Examples of SPV clients are multibit and electrum.
This is a proposal that gives these SPV the power to validate tiny bit more: that the blocks are within the blocksize limits.
If people mine BU blocks that are bigger than what is allowed by bitcoin, SPV clients (connected to bitcoin instead of BU) are now safer that they are not displaying transactions part of BU blocks.

Yes but the biggest and most liquid markets do go both ways ;)
The rest is just their marketing story. There are millions of ways of getting short exposure. It's not clear what the interest would be for getting a loan from blockfi (more than 6% since they need to take a cut as well). I doubt their offering is very good, I know many firms borrowing BTC and ETH for a lot less than 6% a year (through OTC, private investors, etc). But maybe they are focusing on very compliant firms, in any way they are competing with Genesis Trading (one of the biggest OTC coin lenders). Here are some other ways of getting short exposure through the public markets:
- margin short sell on kraken, bitfinex, poloniex or coinbase prime
- short futures on okex, bitmex, kraken
- short perpetual swaps
- sell call options or buy put options (ledgerx, deribit)
I'd say half of these have less fees than borrowing for ~10% (probably more) per year via blockfi (unless the market goes bull, but then they'll push their interest rates up as well).


HODLERs always have 100% downside, all the HODLERS I know have bought in novemeber / december 2017 and are still hodling. They haven't sold the coins on their trezor because they believe it's going to moon. This service is the same. There is no downside if you don't intend to sell, there is only 6% interest per year which you don't get when it's on your trezor. With downside you mean your coins being locked in? This is typically how lending works..

If there were trading on a spot exchange they hold actual bitcoins, if they were trading on a derivatives exchange they do not. But neither is anyone else (except for the margin used to back positions).


Not for firm that was already trading there, read the bottom part of the announcement. That fee only applies to FOMOing retailers.
I agree that derivatives are not directly backed by real assets, if you are trading on bitmex you are trading hot air. But there are links in derivatives: they settle into the underlying spot (real bitcoin in the cash it isn't settled like the CME example you gave), except for the case of the perpetual swap (there is a funding mechanism every 8 hours instead).
The whole thing runs on top of the underlying spot markets (what you call real bitcoin), and yes: there might be a massive short squeeze, and bitmex risk management might not be sufficient for everyone trading derivatives to get all their money out. But when the price crashes arb will buy all the available spot (read: real) bitcoin and the price goes down anyway.


Bitmex daily volume is around a billion dollars, and not many people believe that's being washtraded (neither am I, I'm a market maker on their some of their products). Actual spot is lower. I do think selling millions into the market (short sell, get out) has an effect, I just don't think that's what happened at all.

The problem with this is that they offer a way to pay (with lightning) for data that you can access completely free yourself right now.
Apart from this fundamental problem I completely disagree with this article:
\&gt; Stewart went as far as to call traditional market data and API models “broken,” adding:
I agree, but:
\&gt; “We are using \[the new APIs\] to showcase that lightning allows  \[exchanges\] to monetize things that are monetized at traditional  exchanges. We are pushing the idea that lightning has a multitude of  benefits when integrated into an exchange’s infrastructure that isn’t  just related to withdrawals and deposits.”
Now you are breaking crypto market data: the big difference in crypto trading is that all trading is transparent and freely accessible, paying for market data is one of the things that's broken about traditional markets. This changed the business model of most exchanges so that they make most money on selling data, they architect this in ways that some firms (HFT) are willing to pay millions for fast data. HFT firms now abuse this data to front run (rip off) retail and everyone who isn't HFT. Here is a video that explains the problem: [

Bitcoin doesn't, but the markets do. Bitcoin has a price which you can measure in fiat, that's also the only way to get in and out of bitcoin. You can stay away from all that if you want and just live your life with BTC on your trezor and such. But pretending the markets don't exist don't make them go away. Just like you have Gold and you can put it under your mattress, but there is also a gold market. It will exist regardless if you use it and like it.


I'm not sure why you think you can't get out of tether? Every market that has XXX/USDT is a way to get out of tether, there are direct USD/USDT markets and very liquid OTC channels from getting in and out of USDT. 


Most big trading firms have shell companies through which they access platforms like BFX and Bitmex.


It's exactly the same thing, just because some gamblers use bitmex to speculate, doesn't mean big firms looking to hedge out 10k bitcoin LONG exposure won't be comparing bitmex and blockfi and GT and OTC channels...

That argument has less to do with economics then you think it does: inflation is about the devaluation of money (which represents wealth). People use that to buy things they want, like electronics, cars and other luxery goods (which do not represent wealth as directly). They are utilities we use. You are right that prices for electronics go down: but I didn't buy my laptop because of the amount of money it was worth (or will be worth), I bought it because I wanted/needed a laptop.
I'm repeating myself so many times that I can't help but think you are just trolling at this point..


I think you don't understand how science works. There are only a few sciences were people are able to prove anything (like math, even the concept of proof in any non exact field is not as black and white as you seem to think it is).

There is always that risk, your trezor might have bad RNG. Or you might get attacked physically.

Companies like Oracle and IBM with all their thousands of employers solve a very different problem (and are making tons of money whilst doing this). But why do you think so much of the finance industry revolves around paper? It's not because an Oracle database could solve that problem easier/faster.

I think this will have a significant impact on trading volume: China brings a lot of volume right now (this includes real volume imo), this is because of how attractive crypto is as a purely speculative asset. When looking at this you have to take Chinese culture into perspective here ([example](

Not every bitcoin they loan out is used to short the market. I'm not sure why you think that? AFAIK most bitcoin is lent out to market neutral trading firms, they don't go delta short, they are always net neutral. They will use those bitcoins to provide liquidity in different markets. By loaning those BTC they keep the exposure of their books.
As such this isn't sell pressure, merely more liquidity.
There have been a few firms that were trading directional strategies (long/short), but I think most lost money in 2018 and aren't taking these kind of huge positions anymore that "could easily have suppressed the price 6%".

- Segwit is an improvement to the bitcoin protocol, one of the things it does is allow for lightning (et al.) to be even possible.
- Lightning is entirely new protocol, built on top of bitcoin (requires some changes, changed provided by segwit).
You can built lightning on another blockchain, it's unrelated to bitcoin (or segwit even, it just requires a blockchain - one without tx malleability).


I'd like to see segwit -&gt; lightning -&gt; sidechains! And I think we should avoid hardforks while doing it (if possible, and because of segwit it is).

It actually does not mean that at all. I am not talking about the value per transaction, I am talking about the amount of transactions hitting the blockchain.

You cannot (in a decentralized environment) force miners to do this. That's why there is an economic incentive to not ignore any transactions (you can keep the fees of all tx you include).


And if only this miner only mines on top of high own blocks/chain, his blocks are not the consensus (unless his chain is longer than the other chains), hence making all the work worthless. Another economic incentive.


Take a stand and lobby for not implementing new features that give miners any more decisions that may or may not be incentivised by economics. (BU for example here).

It costs money to mine (you need to run dedicated hardware). The reason people mine is because it also makes money:
 - The block reward
 - Transaction fees


In the future the block reward will go down (until it goes to zero completely). So the miners will only make money in the form of transaction fees.


In a future without lightning or similar:
Well if you don't give the miners any reason to include your transaction (by giving them money for it, aka a stransaction fee), they just might not.
In a future with lightning or similar: just use that.

They are both IMO, it just depends on what you are willing to call decentralized and trustless:
- bigger blocks mean it will be harder to run your own node (therefor less decentralized and requires more trust in the people that run full nodes).
- LN uses a different network model (not peer to peer), which in a way is more centralized ([example](

Legality is simply what the rules are according to legislative entities controlled by some government entities. Kind of like the opposite of decentralized, might as well switch to banks who play that game under rules that are older and better understood by everyone involved. 
You provide infrastructure but can take control. Who's going to stop you if for whatever reason you replug all clients mining and attack something? Sure clients would go elsewhere after such an event, but there is no denying the possibility. I love blockstream and I don't think they would ever do this, but ruling out that any attack (legal, inside job, whatever) just because right now blockstream has better things to do and has different ethical values..

in the first case yes, second case no.
The point is not that you need to steal someone's device. The point is that everything is vulnerable (in different ways) and the things most people trust most (hardware wallets) hide direct access to the private keys for security reasons. This is 100% the same as what Coinbase is doing.
With hardware wallets you do have the option to get raw access to these private keys (through your backup phrase), which is considered bad practise for security reasons (unless you do it on another hardware wallet). But that's about the only difference imo.
They are both systems that proxy your access to your private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:07:35
That comment was misplaced, apologies, I thought I was still in discussion with &gt; This is not even semantics.
This is 100% semantics:


Yes it does, you only have a way to derive the same keys because of the deterministic nature of BIP44, which is the only way to get the private keys. Eg. trezor will NEVER tell you the private key, unless there is an exploit (see link above). So no: a hardware wallet never provides private keys, but instead whilst setting up the device "you" and "the trezor" agree upon a deterministic phrase that let's anyone who knows it generate the same keys. The trezor offers to generate this phrase, but you can also generate this yourself (which according to your terminology would I guess mean that "you provided access of the private keys to the trezor"?).
What I mean is: `coinbase !== hardware wallet`. But the argument that "it's not a wallet if you don't control the keys", is great for learning beginners about bitcoin but is technically an extremely simple version of what is happening.  Most exchanges use bitgo, does that mean that they don't control their bitcoin? Of course they control it, not via private keys but via an API enforced by legal contracts (backed up by a third party). Sending bitcoin is broadcasting a signed message of an UXTO over the network. The fact that a privkey (or multiple) are needed to create this signed message are properties of the underlying technology, nothing more.
I can create a "coinbase" clone where when you sign up you get a BIP44 phrase that lets you derive all private keys. Would you blindly use it? Of course not, since even though you are now "in control" I can still steal all your money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:37:46

EXACTLY! "Having access" to the private keys (directly or not really but kinda via HD like BIP44) does not mean you are in full control of your money! Which means it is super weird to distinguish products as "wallets" or "non wallets" based on this property.
There are a ton of properties that have to do with whether you are in control of your money, we all skipped over all the properties relating to bitcoin forks, especially those with replay protection (=the transaction format has changed on one of the chains).
EDIT: a lot of people, and basically all core devs, are always screaming for people to run their own full node. As it's a lot of a better way to "be in control of your own money". Private keys are only a tiny part of the story, and as shown above are already way to complex to simplify into a single sentence.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:23:07
No you don't, which is the whole point of a hardware wallet. You only control information needed to derive the private keys again. You do not directly control the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:26:46


Yes exactly, meaning they shield the private keys and deny access to them. But give you the option to regenerate them if you want (=you never have access, you can only recreate them, which is not recommended since you lose all the benifits of a hardware wallet). Where coinbase does not. But they both don't directly provide access to your private keys. BIP44 !== privkey. I am not saying hardware wallet === coinbase, I am simply saying they are both wallets with different properties. And they both don't give you (direct) access to your private keys.
Hundreds of thousands of people use coinbase everyday to "control their wealth". Some of them run into an issue, just like some people run into issues using their hardware wallet. Both methods have their vulnerabilities.

This is true if you can download it directly from someone else. But not all nodes are connected to all other nodes: I run a full node here in europe, it has a number of peers (connections to other nodes) but only after one of my peers gave me a new block (the downloading took 40 seconds, the verification took X seconds) I can start broadcasting this to my peers. Even with 1MB it can take quite some time to go through the whole network.
Here is what [a paper]( says about the effect of bigger blocks on propagation times:


Another important detail is that right now a lot of mining happens in China, which has an interesting network infrastructure dubbed the great firewall of china. And it means that connections crossing the Chinese border are extremely slow (everyone whos been to mainland china knows what I mean). So if you want to mine in Europe you need to know about all blocks asap, but the Chinese firewall puts you in a big disadvantage. Especially if blocks will become bigger.
If we have big blocks that propagate slow, statistically speaking you are in a disadvantage if you are not broadcasting a lot (=if you are a small miner) - since other miners already started mining on top of the new block.
*The last part is a bit of an oversimplification since miners broadcasting new blocks under slow propagation are at risk of orphaning, since other miners will only mine on top of the new blocks once they received it. Suffice it to say it's bad for everyone, but big miners and pools can easily exploit this.*

Sounds like a good idea. All the data is already there, one just needs to link it together. Example:
instead of using the blockheight, use datetime of tx and use historical pricing using the [API of bitcoinaverage]( There is no call for the price at date X, but the data is in the `history` call regardless.
EDIT: didn't see that you found the granularity of 1d too high. Not sure why this is too high? Not sure the prices change that much in a single day. If you want exact pricing you also got to worry about the difference between: tx sent, tx confirmed once, tx confirmed 6 times. Also I am thinking you are talking about an API to help consumer apps, if you are talking huge sums of money you wouldn't use a third party API like that anyway (or use a consumer wallet app).

Not directly, and no one knows for sure what will happen. But:
SegWit fixes a bug that prevented "second layer" solutions (like lightning) from being possible (the bug being [Transaction Malleability]( Lightning would allow for transaction outside the blockchain (the miners would not earn as much). But if you measure transaction fees in dollars they are heavily determined by the price of Bitcoin, which might change if Bitcoin with Lightning suddenly allows for hundreds of transactions a second.
*(Note: I am very biased towards lightning, there are arguments to be made against segwit as well.)*

With hardware wallets you also don't control the private keys (just indirectly with a backup phrase and a pin, whereas with coinbase you control it indirectly with a password).

So you can follow bitcoins around the blockchain. But even if you were to at some point link some moved coins to a person you can't really say with confidence that this person is now the thief. He might have bought the coins from someone else.
But even following the bitcoins around the bitcoin is not always that easy. What if there some stolen coins are on address A and they are sent over to address B. If address B gets a bunch of bitcoin from other addresses, and it's sent out to a bunch of other addresses. Where are the stolen bitcoins now? This is the basic concept behind mixing.
Also note that because of the regulatory grey area Bitcoin is in in most jurisdictions, a lot of people trade bitcoins using platforms like localbitcoins (or some darknet equivilant), which don't leave any trial.

I'm a big LN fan but this is definitely overstating the tech in its current form. There are many attack vectors on LN channels against existing nodes. The math adds up, but the current implementations (c-lightning and lnd) are still young.

I was going at it from a reverse engineering perspective. Based on the information in this thread: you are offering the client for free but all work gets submitted to your server anyway, why try to obfuscate what the client is doing?
That smells and sooner or later people will reverse engineer your code, and until that time people will keep screaming that you are eval'ing code send from your server on the client (maybe you have good intentions, but what if your server gets compromised?).

The theory is uncheatable under a lot of assumptions. Such as lightning nodes being able to have bitcoin transactions confirmed when people try to cheat within a certain time window.

Not sure what will happen, but moore's law is about (the increase of) general purpose computer power. Looking at computing power specifically for bitcoin mining (chips that can ONLY hash sha256, eg. mining bitcoin and very maybe cracking of badly secured passwords) we see different trends.
This is hard to predict but I think the major reason why all the mining happens in China is:
- Direct connection to the suppliers that make the chips (ex. bitmain).
- Very cheap electricity.
- Multiple incentives for money - it's okay to lose a bit of money if you are mining to circumvent capital controls.

Well only if you know exactly why this is happening (which you most likely don't). You'd probably spend the first ~30 minutes running around in your datacenter trying to figure out why all of a sudden your miners stop mining (looking at: power, network, your pool, etc).
After you figured that out you can either patch each of your miners individually by taking them down and patching them individually (sounds like fun way to spend your week if you own 100+ miners) or do it on a local network level (MiTM `auth.minerlink.com` yourself) and which now becomes one if your new single points of failure if you ever get hacked.

Because without knowing all transactions, you can't deduce all unspent outputs.


You might be right point to point bandwidth, but 32 mb blocks have a huge number of other problems. A big one being that they take so long to propagate that miners would never risk mining a block that big, in fear or losing out over a smaller block.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:48:13
It's a backdoor and it can be used maliciously (maybe it won't by bitmain, maybe by other parties, and maybe not at all). You can definitely argue that the fact that the bug is malicious (I would have been fired over this very easily, probably sued as well). I don't think anyone is saying that bitmain was planning on using it, this would hurt their business far to much imo.

[not sure if we are nitpicking about the word or not.]
Nodes only verify and relay, confirmations refers to transactions being included in blocks which is a process that miners take care of. You'll never see any software saying a transaction is `confirmed` before it's in a block, even though it's a valid transaction that hasn't been mined yet. 0confs are not confirmed.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:32:46
Your sample code only includes the block header, not the transactions. See here: 
When you mine a block you include a list of transactions. Miners don't just take transactions from the mempool, they also add a special transaction which is called the "coinbase transaction". This is a transaction with some BTC coming from nowhere to any address, this is the mining reward. 
Miners set this to an address they own, since they want to get paid for their efforts. You can say without a doubt that if someone controls an address that got the coinbase reward of a block that entity mined the block. You can prove you control an address by signing a message using the private key belonging to that address. This is not the only way, but by far the easiest.

I'm dutch: this describes the result of a court case. The court decided (we don't have a jury system) in January that party A owed party B 0.591 bitcoin because of a contract related to bitcoin mining (between the two parties). This link to a document (from February) describes that:
- This bitcoin that should have been paid after the previous ruling was never paid.
- The bitcoin needs to be paid in bitcoin (as stated in the contract), can not be paid in euros.
- This is not the only party not being paid by the mining company, more victims.
- "Bitcoin is data stored on a hard disk, it can be send to other parties, it can be proven that bitcoins have been sent from a party to another party", and thus someone oughta send some bitcoin.
- The court has started a process to enforce the bitcoin from the mining company (using a "curator").
I'm not seeing the big news here, they only thing the court said (in my understanding) is that bitcoins are tangible things that can be send, and it can be verified whether they were. It doesn't say anything about bitcoin being money / a currency / a financial asset / etc.
[EDIT]: upon reading it some more, it **DOES** say:


Bitcoin is transferable and represents a value.


Because of this (the court has decided that) this means that bitcoin has properties of "wealth right" and therefor some laws related to repossession of wealth ("vorderings recht") apply. Though I am only reading this in relation to the fact that the guy has to pay bitcoin, the wording doesn't specifically call bitcoin anything (just that because of some properties some laws apply). But IANAL.

I think this isn't for your average website to charge money to your end users, a paywall would probably work better. This is a replacement for any type of technical service your app could use, for example: database hosting providers such as AWS could use this protocol to charge per query (which usually go over a REST API already). This way you don't have to pay AWS every month in USD through your account anymore, you can build it completely anonymous on a pay as you go basis.

It's a piece of software (bitcoin node) that listens to blocks and publishes them through the satellite. It's a single piece of software completely controlled by a single company. **If everyone relies on that satellite** they would be gatekeepers to what blocks are honored and which ones are not (because they contain tx that single company doesn't like for example - they will ping the miners that they won't relay those blocks and miners would adapt).

Though there is risk when doing a limit order: the price might move the other way before someone hits it. If the price moves more than 0.3% before your order hits you'll pay more anyway (unless you have slippage).
0.3% of $500 is $1.50, which is more than 0 but a lot less than $7.34. I probably wouldn't have bothered doing a limit order.

@_date: 2019-01-02 15:42:32
Broadly speaking you are very right.
But note that there are still some attack scenarios, such as not mining specific transactions from entities they don't like. Or double spend their own unconfirmed tx.
Those things are very hard to detect, but if they really want to be bad actors they can send X bitcoin to an exchange. Wait for it to confirm (bitmex only requires a single confirmation) and orphan off the main chain by mining on top of the second oldest block, double spending the confirmed tx. They can double spend the tx with a new deposit tx to keep "depositing" for as long as exchanges allow deposits (unless the exchange is prepared for this).
If they would margin sell (high leverage) with the bitcoin they deposited 10 times they could crash the price. People would find out quickly and everyone would panic sell which crashes the price even more (especially if during that time you keep orphaning the chain with empty blocks (except your own deposit tx) or simply mine empty blocks so no one can move BTC around). Imagine setting up a few shorts on different accounts with high leverage just before doing that ;)
But than again, this would render all their mining equipment useless if everyone loses trust in bitcoin. It's a great exit play though (or simply rent the hashing power, doubt you can do this on BTC but definitely on BCH or alts).

Nope, not talking about that. I'm talking about the fact that the software / hardware is under control of one company. And they have 100% control over what block gets broadcasted.
Actually multiple companies can do that, since Blockstream doesn't own the satellite. They do control the uplink:


It says the answer is no, but it also says:


In other words, using this doesn't add to any decentralization since you still need to verify everything through other channels if you want to be sure. Unless you trust Blockstream, which is as centralized as can be.

I had to delve into this myself. In your OP you include `rootHash` which I guess is the merkle root hash. I didn't see this before. In that case you already included what I though you were missing.


The magic is in the merkleroot in this list: This is the root of a merkletree of all the transactions. The whole point is that you need to find a solution that proves you've done work for a specific set of transactions. Hashing the transactions means that *no one* can change the set of transactions that are included in the block, which is what you need to get consensus on. Read this article for more details:


This is already part of the merkle root. as for the next steps? I am not sure, I never implemented a miner. Maybe look at a mining implementation? But your main question: "how to prove you mined it" is done through the coinbase transaction in which you can put some data, see here for a block with coinbase data: 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:14:03
Agreed, but edge nodes (nodes with only 1 link) also don't make a lot of sense IMO for 2 reasons:
1. it can only do transactions originating or ending from that node.
2. funds are unlikely (imo) to flow in both directions, meaning at some point the channel gets drained one way and some kind of onchain tx needs to come in to fix it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:07:39
So it's not actually the nodes that confirm your transactions, it's miners who "mine a block" (that includes your transaction).

And a video is defniitely not cryptograhpic proof, people have been faking UFO videos for over a hundred years now.

- with normal UTXO: no access to private key that can be used to sign a new tx means you lose the coins.
- with money locked up in channels: no access to multisig presigned transaction that can be used to send locked coins to another address you control means you lose the coins.
You just gotta make those backups all the IT people have been talking about for decades now.
EDIT: if your node dies in the middle of a lightning transactoin (which are kind of instant, meaning before your node receives the new updated signed tx) this might be a bit more complex.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:11:34
Note that this kind of attacks are very hard to mitigate: the malware can just as well only replace the QR which means manually verifying the address (not even sure how one would do this) won't work.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:54:15
I'm no expert but:
I'm not sure if running a lightning node (how they are currently implemented, eg. implementation of the BOLT spec) are meant for end users to run on phones or other hardware that isn't online 24/7.
Basically after every lightning transaction both your node and the other side of the channel need to sign a new TX with updated state (who owns how much now), this process requires a private key.
Based on my current understanding of the spec it might be possible in the future to create a semi-trustless service that opens lightning channels for users (with the channel TX pointing to an address the user controls) where the service will take care of managing the lightning channels and whatever happens the node cannot steal the money since the channel will always collapse into the user's address. Especially in cases where service only runs edge nodes that don't route themselves (so whenever the channel is active the user can actually be online to sign a new channel state).
I might be totally off here, maybe someone with a deeper understanding of the protocol can weigh in.

"Bitcoin private keys" are simply private keys according to the spec used by bitcoin, you can use them to sign whatever you want. That doesn't make it so that when you do you are using bitcoin.


Exactly! Outside the bitcoin network / blockchain.


This is exactly what makes it different, take the following example:
What if I print 100 paper wallets of all 0.1 btc each. And I would give them to some people to barter around, eg. 1 paper wallet for 3 chickens, etc. etc. We are transacting using bitcoin private keys (in this example we are not signing anything - but from bitcoin's point of view nothing is signed/verified/mined anyway **except for the tx where the coins where send to the priv key of the paper wallet**). Are you using bitcoin in a system like this? No, because the first person who has a QR scanner can claim all the money, eg. this system is NOT secured by bitcoin. All these barter transactions are NOT bitcoin transactions.

Bitcoin can devalue just as much. It devalued almost half compared to november 2013.

I personally think they way Coinbase secures their cold wallets is pretty hard to beat.
The main thing is that there are different types of risks, some which Coinbase has a lot more exposure to. They might lock your account (because of problems like in OP, or because of pressure from law enforcement, or because you didn't file your taxes properly, or because your from a country Coinbase is not allowed to deal with, etc).

There over 200k unconfirmed transactions that dispute your claim. It sounds a lot like "No one goes there anymore, it's to crowded".


Scaling is hard, and you don't sound very convincing from a perspective of architecting scaling solutions in an extremely complex distributed system that if fails, will take down billions of dollar - most likely destroying a lot of the public's trust in cryptocurrencies in general.


As soon as people actually use alts it will run into exactly the same situation as bitcoin, without the smartest people in the field working on solving them.

It was never meant to be "enough". SegWit is an update that solves a bunch of problems that have been plaguing bitcoin for years. Everyone developing on the protocol level wants to get this fixed, definitely not limited to the fields you mentioned.


This really is not an argument you'll ever hear someone make who has ever worked with raw blocks (and I am pretty sure you haven't - else you wouldn't be making this argument). If you have a problem with moving around witness data, but no problem at all with the current script language and the huge amount of changes it has gone through in the past, I really don't understand why all of a sudden with SW it's an issue (or all all changes to consensus logic technical debt?

Only the opening and the closing transaction **of the channel** are on chain, the whole idea of LN is that within a channel hundreds of transactions will take place.
Bitcoin only has a concept of transactions, aka payments. A channel is hack on top of a system that only supports payments (by using 1 or 2 payments per channel). A channel is not a payment because:
- A channel can route any number of payments.
- A payment can go through any number of channels (hops)
- When using LN, your transactions will go through channels, which if they are already open won't leave a trace in the blockchain (also called offchain === not on the blockchain === not bitcoin).
- You can have LN balance not visible on the blockchain (until you close a channel).
LN uses bitcoin, but it builds an entire new system on top of it. They are most definitely not the same.

Just because coinbase keeps transactions between coinbase users offchain does not make it so that these are actually using bitcoin.
From bitcoin's perspective you've locked coins, that's all the bitcoin network knows/cares about. That you then go and transact outside the bitcoin (network/blockchain) doesn't make it part of the bitcoin network (the same as the coinbase example).
If wallet providers later do this func under the hood doesn't make them native to bitcoin (again, same as coinbase example).

The main argument against it (or so I think) is that it does not solve the scaling issue: the network cannot handle the amount of current transactions and SW itself won't do much to solve that*. The argument being that we shouldn't do anything except raise the blocksize - SW being a distraction.
*The Lightning network might provide this but comes with it's own set of rules, eg. it's something very different than Bitcoin.

I say you have three options:
- Do you have any logs/records about the breach? This is by far the easiest way to trace back who hacked you (but depending on their opsec this might not be traceable at all).
- There are companies doing blockchain forensics, contact them.
- Contact exchanges and payment providers to watch out for money coming from those addresses (will be very hard once it is all mixed), eg. bitfinex is doing this for their lost coins. But I am not sure how much help they will be.

I don't see any reason why anyone having that key would do it. 1 bitcoin is not a lot for someone who has access to roughly 1 million bitcoins ([source]( It would divide the community once again between people who believe you and people who think the funds are locked / SN is dead (and thus believe you took the coins yourself) and the media will once again go crazy about who/where SN is.

You are correct: Electrum is saying that:
if you run another wallet called "Electron cash" on your computer that also has "Electrum", "Electron cash" wallet will copy over all your Electrum files. Those files include your BTC private keys (which are also your BCC private keys). What Electron Cash will do with those files is unknown, since the code is "secret" (you have to take the developer's word, wheras all of electrum code can be checked since it is fully open source).
If you don't touch Electron Cash you are definitely safe, you can also use another computer to keep your BTC safe (assuming you don't import the seed into electron cash of course).

When using LN you can don't need to wait for the onchain confirmation, in fact the onchain confirmation (for any amount of channels that was part of the routing of this specific tx) is completely unrelated from the LN transaction you just did. And in fact, might never happen at all.


My example was not trying to explain LN, simply why if you do anything **outside the bitcoin network** (whether it is giving a paper to someone else or signing a a message or transaction but NOT route it through the bitcoin network) is not bitcoin.


This is exactly what I am arguing.
I think we are just disagreeing about semantics. I don't want to fork of, I just think differently about what is bitcoin and what is not.
I see LN more as a system to create sidechains: all the things we know about bitcoin transactions don't apply anymore:
- When sending a bitcoin tx you need to wait for a confirmation before you know the tx is final and cannot be reversed.
- A bitcoin tx confirmation takes roughly 10 minutes.
- The bitcoin network can (currently) only handle 7 tx a second
- You can validate UTXO by looking at the blockchain
If you are willing to say that as soon as we have LN the above properties are not bitcoin properties anymore but only properties of legacy blockchain transactions (because LN transactions are also bitcoin transctions to which all the above properties do not apply) I guess you are right. I guess we just have different definitions of what a bitcoin tx is..

And your example talks about physical safety boxes? I wasn't giving an example on how funds can be stolen, I was giving an example of how LN transactions don't touch the bitcoin network.


I don't think you understand how LN works.


If I want to send money to you, I will most likely not open a channel with you, as there are already existing channels between us. And I also won't close a channel with you (as there was none open to begin with). Opening and closing channels is expensive so you want to keep them open. If you think that LN is about opening those for each transaction (eg. therefor has the properties I described above) you clearly don't understand LN.
This is literally the abstract of the LN whitepaper:


TLDR: it happens offchain OUTSIDE the bitcoin network BUT if something goes wrong we can settle on blockchain using signed messages the parties have been sending to each other all along.

Why do you think CZ cannot rollback bitcoin? He is well connected to most big Chinese miners. He has easily access to 70%+ of BTC's mining capacity.
Of course reorging from block 47388-1 will mean:
a) miners will lose a day's revenue.
b) people lose trust
c) chaos as many transactions could potentially be reverted in the big reorg.
That simply means that for miners this has a cost. Is that cost 40 million? Probably not. What happened if instead of 40 million (2% of binance BTC holdings) 40% (800 million) got stolen? Keep in mind that if you don't think it's a rational choice, that doesn't mean all miners agree with you and will conclude the same. Look at the whole BCH fiasco and how much that has cost big miners.

For these people coinbase might just be what they need.

Multisig allows you to store coins so you need multiple private keys to spend them. The idea is that these keys are in different places held by different people, so there is not 1 weak spot.
However stealing the private keys is only one way to steal money from an exchange, in the case of Binance it seems their withdrawal systems were breached, meaning that system (that has the private keys) was tricked into sending bitcoin to the hacker. But AFAIK the hacker never actually stole the private keys. Multisig wouldn't have stopped that.
EDIT: Some exchanges like Bitmex don't even have a hot wallet, everything is stored (via multisig) in cold storage and once a day they manually go over everything and do withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:16:01
I don't know the details, but that's not likely. More likely is that the hacker said to the withdrawal system (after hacking Binance's internal network) "there is a 7k BTC withdrawal to this address". And that passed all the automatic checks and the money was send. But that never belonged to any user. Binance doesn't have exact outputs (coins) for every user, as that would mean they have to send TX onchain every time you make a trade. I'm guessing the hacker send as much as the hot wallet contained, completely draining it.

@_date: 2019-05-08 12:14:43


No they don't! The software is automatically going to pick the chain with the most work (for as long as it abides by consenus rules). This is different from the previous fork debates as they were about changing consenus rules.
To make matters worse: if Binance would have done a rollback and you don't like "their" chain, you'd actively need to update your software to use another chain!


This is very false: A majority of full nodes has 0 meaning as it's vulnerable to sybil attacks. It has meant something in the past (UASF) but ONLY for marketing purposes in the situation of changing consensus rules (segwit, 2mb, 10mb, etc). For as long the consensus rules stay the same there is only 1 way to determine a valid chain: which one has the most work. This is called proof of work and it has nothing to do with what people want and what kind of node software 50% of the people run.


You are very right, but the miners would NOT be sending invalid blocks! A rollback is NOT a fork.

\&gt; Because every single user run active node would have to agree.
And they would.... Miners would start mining on top of 47388-1, as soon as that new chain has more work all nodes will start agreeing. That's what a rollback means.. If CZ get's a big majority of miners to play along all other miners might follow as to not lose money on mining on a dead chain.
\&gt; Those miners who chose to mine for the bailout would be creating a new  chain which the current users and miners would either have to also  download and use, or it would split what is "bitcoin" in two.
No one is denying that. It's the same as what happened to ETH after the DAO hack (ETC). But did you stop calling ETH ETH after that? Not many people did..
As to the inevitable fork resulting from such a hostile rollback. Where users side will depend on many things. Binance going the Mt. Gox route after a big hack (bigger than 2%) is very much a doom scenario in the space already. I'm not saying they side on Binance. But you can't make blanket statements that CZ doesn't understand how PoW works... A rollback is very much possible..

It is true, the only thing you need for this is enough mining power to mine more than all other miners in the world combined. As your chain needs to have the most work. Also note that your chain is a day behind the main chain since your reorg needs to have the work from the hack until right now. It's not likely you'll get that with a single ASIC.


No, please don't confuse a fork (change of consensus rules) with a reorg.


It's not a different chain, not sure why you think it is? Merely a different chaintip.


Please read about PoW, maybe from the bitcoin whitepaper. If CZ would have rollbacked and no one changed anything we would be following his version of events right now..


PoW only means: the most work is the truth. If many miners mine a different version since the hack they would at some point overtake the current chaintip. When this happens a reorg happens.

- *Die hard UASF fans will sell all their non UASF coins and try to crash the price, people on the other side will do the same with UASF coins.

There is more to bitcoin than the blockchain. There is what big wallets say it is, what block explorers say it is, what exchanges (like binance say it is).
How is it wrong? Let me clarify the statement you're saying is wrong and you can tell me what's wrong about it:


This means that once any chain that abides by BTC consensus rules has more work than the current chain, all BTC nodes from users will use that chaintip.
Are you saying that this is not true? How so?


Unfortunately this is false. The BTC chain reorgs all the time and all nodes manage automatically behind the scene. This is the reason exchanges require multiple confirmations: deeper reorgs are less likely to happen and forcing them costs more money.


This is also false. Running a node simply means you are validating all transactions and all blocks to not break the consensus rules. A deep reorg doesn't break any consensus rules and nodes are happy to agree to this new chaintip (such as one from CZ's proposed rollback). This doesn't mean miners can do everything: they cannot create transactions unless they also break some crypto. Also this is a very expensive operation, depending on how deep the reorg is and how many miners are on board.


You don't need miners, you can also just change consensus rules and cause a hardfork. For example this happened to ETH before (ETH split into ETH and ETC to rollback a hacker stealing funds). But you can do this with miners just as easily (not in all crypto, some use snapshots, bitcoin doesn't).

Your wallet has multiple addresses. If you want to send a small amount of the bitcoins you have to someone else, your wallet will automatically generate a new address and sends everything else to that address.

- crypto police = a party that judges how weak certain crypto is.
- cryptocat = weak crypto (not publicly judged by Apple, but by everyone else involved in crypto).
- danger of weak crypto when advertised as safe = people get tortured and/or killed.
- freedom from Apple's perspective = products that work, that do not lead to frustration (hence the strict quality guidelines - see carrier example) and enable you to do more things with less.
Last one is pretty subjective and also the one most people don't agree with. You could argue that Android offers more freedom, but I [have my doubts]( that freedom is just about allowing stuff.

It appears to not be open source, but an 'unauditable' hardware feature very close to the chip: no one can read the source and because it's about random numbers, it's not really possible to say whether it provides random numbers or some sort of pattern known to intel and other parties.

I'm not sure if it's possible to convince you... If you think you are correct and core devs are wrong when it comes to bitcoin consensus...
You are correct in saying that if miners mine blocks considered invalid nodes wouldn't accept them, a fork happens due to some people updating and the network might split. This is just not such a situation.


You either completely made this up or listened to someone who did. Please fill me (a developer) and other core developers in, seems we all missed this memo. Keep in mind mining has moved away from bitcoin nodes since about early 2012.
I'm not replying anymore, because it seems you are just trolling.. a non developer (inferred from your earlier comments) knows more about bitcoin consensus than core devs and other people who called you out a few comments above...
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:08:38
Exactly, they don't want to merge it because they feel it's not inline with the safe and thought out changes that normally go in. Everyone (except wants segwit to succeed (including me) and I really hope that if UASF happens everyone will join the segwit chain and it will be a happy ending for bitcoin.
I'm just talking about the other scenario of fucking everything up by splitting the chain and community. Definitely not worth it imo.

In this case the problem was caused by the new owner of the domain putting malware on the website (or getting hacked).
When site x.com does not use SSL it is possible for other servers to pretend to be x.com and serve different content. This can be achieved in multiple ways, for example by DNS spoofing. When x.com uses SSL not only is all data between clients and x.com encrypted, but the client also *knows* that it is on the real x.com by the proven SSL cert, which is signed by a trustworthy party (cert providers).
This improves the security by a big factor but is still not bullet proof:
- The cert provider can get hacked (unlikely but stuff like this [happened before](
- The cert can get stolen from x.com (this way your data is compromised, I think a Man in the Middle can decrypt the data, change content, encrypt again without you noticing, not sure about this though.).
- A client's browser can be hijacked (pretty easily).
- A client's dns can be poisoned (also pretty easily).

Oh there is a lot of reason, the chain will be split for days/weeks before it is clear whether it takes off. Media will jump on this "attack on bitcoin", people don't feel safe transacting because of replay attacks, people who did so anyway will lose money on replay attacks, the discussion will turn full on flame war / retard.

@_date: 2017-06-04 13:27:43


I 100% agree, I think UASF is a terrible idea (just like the majority of people who make the main bitcoin software: the bitcoin core dev team).


Some context: people (including me) want segwit, there is currently a proposal and we can get that in with enough miner support (95%+). But the whole reason for UASF is because miners are not giving their support, so the idea behind UASF is to have segwit without miner support.
The hard thing about decentralized systems is consensus, bitcoin solved this using PoW (mining), however if the incentives of the miners do not align with the rest of the network (miners don't want segwit, everyone else does) it becomes extremely hard to define consensus (since we cannot rely on the only way we currently know it: PoW).


Running full nodes is cheap, thus this number is very easy to spoof, it's called a sybil attack.


pro segwit people don't trust miners in this regard, think they will block it.


Leaving it in the hands of the biggest companies? I don't think a lot of bitcoin people would agree that this is a good idea...
Hence we find ourselves in this position.

If you need to hold liquidity but want 0 exposure simply short the same amount somewhere. With bitmex you can short on high leverage, meaning that if you need to hedge a 100 bitcoin long (=100 bitcoin held on escrow for x time) you can do that on bitmex for less bitcoin (though you need to watch not getting liquidated).

If it only was that easy.. As soon as the public view of Bitcoin becomes too negative it's not possible anymore to build a successful business for consumers in this market. Building a startup brings along a lot of risk, and by betting on Bitcoin you just added new risk that has nothing to do with your startup / your concept / your execution.
Bitcoin is only now losing the drugs image it got two years ago because of [a single blogpost]( If something serious happens with the currency like: terrorists using it to send money around / darknet markets becoming big / getting taxes becomes hard / ML. Or something happens with the protocol: CP in the ledger, technical [scaling] problems, etc. it's game over for your startup, even if it was otherwise going to be the next facebook.

For a while there might be 2 different bitcoins, and your bitcoin wallet can only see one. This is very bad, here some examples of how this can go wrong:
- if you have a wallet on the other side you will not see my transaction confirm (even though I will), in that case you think I have more money than I think I do. 
- if you send bitcoins in one chain, I can take the transaction and also send the coins in the other chain (unless you took proper technical precautions), this is called a replay attack.
- if you have been transacting bitcoin one on chain (the non UASF), the 2 different bitcoins might become one again and all the transactions that were confirmed suddenly become non existent, losing a lot of money for a lot of people.
So unless you are very informed and technical, chances are you'll lose money (unless you stop transacting from 1 august indefinitely). I guess you can see why I don't think this is a good idea.

You are correct, what I meant was not that my home pc is able to verify the transactions (which it is already doing). But that if the difficulty was lower my computer is able to do everything all current miners combined are doing now.
The block that gets hashed contains not only the transactions but also the previous hash (hence it's called a block chain) and needs to be &lt; target (which is based on difficulty). The only reason why we need to hash as much as we do today is because of the high target (which is necessary if you want to have one block every fixed interval with a non fixed hashing power).
My only point is that the mining network is in no way as power efficient as it could have been.

You really should be careful with such statements like "it's not possible" when you probably don't know how this stuff really works. It's a great defence for people screaming that Bitcoin can be hacked by his 10y old nephew, but it just doesn't hold up at all imo:
As a thought experiment here is a such a compromise (theft of 50% of all BTC) that might appear: 
- Intel [has put a unauditable hardware RNG]( in most of it's chipsets &lt;- true story
- Linux uses this RNG to provide randomness to userland (like bitcoin-qt for example) &lt;- true story
- Bitcoin-qt asks for randomness from Linux (for everyone using linux) to calculate a seed which in turn is used to calculate private and public keys. &lt;- true story
- Intel lied about the how random the hardware RNG is: it is not random at all but can be recalculated with relative ease. 
- Intel can now calculate ALL private keys ever generated on linux systems using all applications that use randomness from userland with extreme ease (which can easily account for more than 50% of all BTC distributed over all wallets, probably closer to 90%).
If this were to happen this is not a bug in Bitcoin's source but rather Bitcoin trusting the OS way to easily. You can also apply this scenario to every other major OS that either uses intel's RNG or uses its own which could also be not really random.

I apologies if I may not have been clear in what I think will happen, this is what I mean:
there are consumers right now and this number will not shrinken but grow. But the critical mass of consumers using bitcoin (that is people in your street / town / city and not those in the Bitcoin subreddit) will not come any time soon, however I do think Bitcoin will grow in the near future, and that is mainly by the parties in the OP.
Guys I really don't try to spread FUD, I am just trying to be realistic. The banking industry (for example) threw a lot of money towards getting general acceptance for online banking for consumers (while the rest of the infrastructure was already digital for the most parts). Bitcoin is a lot more complicated for end users who don't live on the internet.

This is exactly the thing: Core does not want UASF at all. It's a community driven thing that some individuals within core support, but the far majority does not. Hence why there is no UASF version of bitcoin core for download.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:40:02


- in terms of who finds the next block: yes
- in terms of how many blocks one finds per day: no
If the diff is high but not enough hash power to support it it will just mean less blocks than 10 a minute*. But once the diff adjusts (downwards) it will become easier :)
*This is a big fear people have with UASF: if a lot of users jump on the chain but almost no miners, it will be a very though time since there will be very little blocks until either adjustment or more miners.
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:55:30
I also think the dynamics of the network are quite strange because all the transactions that are currently being verified could also be verified by 1/1000th of the current hashing power, by just lowering the difficulty (which has no purpose except for catching new hashing power added to the network without lowering the block time AFAIK).
Most miners look at it this way: as long as you are generating more money in coins than it costs to power the mining stuff, it's profitable. The hard part is the volatility of the BTC price.
As for your question, I think it applies the same way to gold now: Are you going out with a shovel trying to find gold yourself? No specialised companies can do this way more efficient. 
If you want gold yourself you can do:
1. exchange for labor (mining it).
2. exchange for labor (getting paid for other work in gold).
2. exchange for fiat (buying gold)
3. invest and speculate, this way trying to increase the start amount. After you've done this you also obtained it through your own accord.
 - speculate on the price (trading)
 - speculate through betting
 - speculate through gambling
The same goes for bitcoin / altcoins, etc (small difference that the first is not your labor anymore, but your mining equipment's, which has a price tag and a power consumption). Mining is definitely not the only way to get coins anymore.
@_date: 2013-07-20 17:50:09
I am sorry if I appear like someone ranting and spreading FUD. I just want to close of with:

I agree that this paradigm is outdated, but that's the way the rest of the world views Bitcoin right now.

The bot is extremely new, and I'm still testing wether to see if it's stable (I have it running for almost 24h now, which is more stable than the browser plugin in my case). But I got to start somewhere!
Gekko is inspired by the [MtGox trading bot Chrome plugin]( and it basically does the same thing: 
It tries to identify trends and ride them: if Gekko sees that the price is getting lower every time it knows we are in a downtrend (or higher for an uptrend). On default it won't do anything with your balance and only report the changes in trends, but you can set auto trade:
If Gekko detects a new downtrend it will sell all your BTC (so that it can rebuy when the price is lower) or buy with all your USD at a new uptrend. So you **should not** have a lot of balance on the account. (Consider the auto trade function alpha, I am using it myself but I won't recommend it to others yet).
I've had the browser plugin running for a week or so with about 3% profit, I think that number won't differ much with Gekko.
As for the bitcoin stats site: I'm pretty busy myself, when I have time I try to squeeze in some hours for projects like this. You can always send me some more details but I can't promise anything :)

In my study we did research towards helping elderly in online banking and what we found (I don't have any proof at this point, but I do think it's pretty logical) is that a lot of elderly people that don't trust anything digital prefer to use cash whenever possible. 
In Europe (where I live and have most experience) all different quantity coins and bills have different colors, seizes and weight (for coins), this makes it always easy for people with poor vision to pay with cash. Compare this to a phone which she doesn't understand, has all problems I addressed above and where a single comma (we use commas here :-) ) makes a hell of a lot of a difference.
And the biggest advantage of credit cards is that whenever you get scammed the credit card company does a chargeback and you get your money back.

I agree with the big picture, but there are some cultural differences when comparing Bitcoin with the internet:
- We have shifted to an information age with the help of the internet.
- The complete landscape of a lot of end user markets (media and entertainment for example) have drastically changed since the internet.
- Cultural values like what does privacy mean, what does a country / border mean are completely different now.
I can see Bitcoin change a lot of existing monetary markets (especially in Asia / Africa / global environments) and change the rules. But I still have doubts to see this change ripple through to (western) end user markets in the way the internet did. 
I think if it catches on the result wil be a mix the situation described in the article and the change from IPv4 to IPv6: an extremely big change in infrastructure without any impact on consumers.

Could you please elaborate?


If *Henk* wins the lotto and gets 1000 BTC send to his wallet address (which is a public transaction) everyone who knows that that address is Henk's will know he now is pretty rich. If he keeps the address private but ever spents from that address the other party will know immediately how wealthy Henk really is.
Besides the blockchain, if criminals found about about Henk's wealth. They might threaten / torture him or kidnap his son to hand over the bitcoins. If they succeed (which is more easier than with fiat because there doesn't have to be any meeting point with a physical bag of cash, they just need the private key) the coins are really hard to track.

It is true that lobbying is not part of this free market (or network society). But they would not lobby *as much* when they don't (feel they) have to fight legislation that prevents a free market. Like the bigger the company the more tax they'll need to pay, or laws for the rights of the consumer, etc. all are not part of a free market. In a true free market you either survive or get obliterated (or kill or be killed as another way of looking at it). If kids in asia are cheaper than USA employees (including the cost to hide this / risk management / this doesn't lose your customers, etc) you don't have any reason to keep it national inside the USA.
Do you think the two platinum members of the Bitcoin foundation bought that membership out of the goodness in their heart? Besides benefiting financially from the  things the foundation is now fighting for as well as the good PR, you really don't think they want to ensure some steering (aka lobbying) power?

Both are correct I think, just two different ways of looking at them. The problem to be solved includes all transactions that are to be verified.
-- 


Maybe right now. But there don't have to be any correlation between the number of transactions and the power consumption of the network. if the the price of a BTC were to go up ten times, a lot of people will start hashing again because it's profitable and now the power consumption can be way higher (higher than all of VISA's servers) while the number of transactions don't have to be any higher at all.

As I (admittedly under)stated in the OP under '1)' I did say my criticism is about the view of most western cultures and not about the rest of the world. This is not because I think the rest of the world does not exist but because all the fantasies about the mass deflation caused by the collapse of the western monetary system (which I do not think will happen at all in the near future).
I agree it is really hard to discuss about some parts of the world while completely ignoring others.

I agree for the most part, and BTC will become more stable than it currently is. But note that even fiat currencies are very volatile at the moment, this problem is small for consumers because the whole country is using it. 
Also there are a lot of hedges that have way more money than the whole BTC market cap combined.


Except when there is still little trust (as there is now) and people decide to run and take all their BTC out (which can cause a crash, as happened twice before). This will hopefully (it even happened tot he USD before) get smaller and smaller, but right now that is definitely not the case.

It means that if you've used a version from before june 15th 2013 anyone who has the encrypted data (like the NSA, probably) can crack the keys and decrypt the data (= all messages from before the new version).

When you have a Windows machine (for example) and it gets compromised this most likely means there is a trojan or something similar. This installs a backdoor (apart from vendor backdoors, which are definitely a concern when you are dealing with things like crypto).
Most trojans log and call home everything you do via keyloggers, etc. This is how they gather logins and passwords. Some more advanced take automatic screenshots or even capture webcam/mic feeds. When you are infected there is a chance your PC is part of a botnet. There are botnets with *a lot* of infected machines and the operators are not going through every pc by hand. 
If there is bitcoin malware, it will most likely upload all wallet.dat files that look like bitcoin wallet files (that contain the private keys) to a server fully automatic. (That or send the coins to their wallet from your own bitcoin client).
EDIT: It is still pretty easy to get infected: download pirated stuff, visit a website with a drive by installer (java exploit, flash exploit or even browser specific) or the good old `sexy_ladies_jpg.exe`. The drive by installers not only come from strange phishy websites, there are a couple of stories that bigger websites got hacked and malware gets implanted (for a couple of hours most of the time).

You can get bitcoins the same way as you can get gold: You can either buy it from someone who has it or mine it yourself. The last one is getting harder and harder, you don't have to do any math yourself but the process is still pretty technical for mining.
There are getting more and more places where you can buy stuff for bitcoins (like buying stuff for gold), but it's still pretty limited.
Because of the way Bitcoin works no one will give you your money back when someone steals it. If you buy bitcoin through an exchange (an online place that connects buyers and sellers) you are guaranteed that you will receive the coins whenever the trade is done.
When you have a bitcoin in a wallet you basically have a password (called the `private key`) which gives you access to the bitcoins. If you give that password to 10 people and your bitcoin get stolen you cannot know who stole them. If you install a wallet on your pc and you have a virus the private key can get stolen, together with all your bitcoins, and you can do almost nothing about it. If you are technical (and have large amount of bitcoins) you can put the private key on a USB drive so it doesn't sit on your computer all the time. If you are not technical at all I recommend using an online wallet service with 2 factor auth (so that you need your username/password + your phone to access the bitcoins) that knows how to properly protect the keys.

[Around 5% of all people in the world]( are native english speakers.
And for those we are: identifying potential threads based on spelling is hard. If a beggar comes up to you and asks for 1 dollar you will, based on how he looks, how he talks (+ spelling), the situation and the environment make up your mind whether you think he will steal your wallet or not. Everything besides the spelling is a lot harder for people not living on the internet (like for people who are in a big city for the first time)

This is against Apple's philosophy. If someone uses Cryptocat (or any other weak crypto) in general to say something not allowed in a certain country and that person get's tortured is it really that fair to say: "yea you should have done better research, your own fault"?
Also note that Cryptocat is focussed towards people who **don't understand crypto**, ea. the people who are not able to properly research it.


Totally agreed but saying to people who don't understand crypto that the software is totally secure because it's open source and verified etc. while it has extremely big holes in is not just ignorant. **You are risking other peoples lives here**. Either do it good or, do it bad and say it or don't know anything at all.

She does, she needs to know that the hardware vendor is trusted. Besides the fact that she needs to buy a device that she needs to keep safe at all times. Because when someone copied the private key all her coins are forever compromised. Also tell her that when she drops her device in the toilet she just lost all her money and no one will give it back.
What I mean is that USD (besides inflation) does not have a fee structure in itself. All fees are by companies on top of the USD, just like fees by e-wallets, exchanges, services, etc.
advantages of fiat currency:
it works when your smartphone:
 - doesn't have reach
 - has an empty battery
 - your e-wallet is down
 - your smartphone is full of viruses
 - gets stolen
or even when you don't have a smartphone.


My opinion is that Bitcoin is currently hard for consumers but that bitcoin adoption lies elsewhere. What facts are wrong or misleading? Saying that old people will die and that all younger people do understand it and think it's better than the last couple hundred years way of doing economy is living in a fantasy IMO.

"But there will be a lot of exchanges!" Except that in a free market only fittest will survive imo.
I think most people currently hoarding Bitcoin care little about this new monetary system which does not have any protection of becoming worse than the current one. They are blinded by the thought of them becoming Bitcoin millionaires. But people can't be blamed, the [same happens in Africa]( where rebels standing against tyrants become the new tyrants like clockwork.

I just watched your whole talk, which is way more relavant to this discussion than I previously thought. I have to say: good job, great talk!
I agree with you that in the western world the advantages of Bitcoin are really small for a consumer point of view (which is basically what my whole discussion is about) but I have to admit that I failed to address these issues on a global scale where my points (few advantages and volatility) don't hold up at all compared to the situation of most people in the world.
Offtopic about your talk: the neutrality on the network is indeed of vital importance, but what about the entry points for a lot of these people without a connection to the blockchain? How can we prevent local governments from combining their own money into the paper bitcoin notes (for example) which they can control? Off chain is a great solution for remote locations without solid connections, but how do we make sure these also remains neutral?

I am not sure if the fact that users need to know that the website can be really trusted makes it *harder*, but it does make it a lot more scary. Thus in this way making it harder to use. My point is that not all the reality is as easy and good as the article portrays in my opinion.

They are destructive because only one party is able to do one (the one sending the fiat through paypal / cc) and get away with it (this is basically scamming IMO). But in a world where everyone uses BTC to send to each other, scammers are also lurking around every corner.


I am currently attending university (in media / IT, somewhere I'd expect Bitcoin to thrive) and I have yet to find a single student besides myself that has any interest in owning BTC. And believe me have I looked :(
Here paying (without cash, with 'pin') goes pretty simple: grab your (CC shaped) card, shove it into the device, press the 4 digit pin and accept.
I don't think using Bitcoin is more simple: seeing QR, grabbing smartphone, browsing through sea of (social media) apps looking for the wallet app, opening it, logging in / putting pin in, tapping the camera / pay now button, waiting for the camera to load, try to focus the lens so it can scan the QR code, press ok, wait for slow cell signal to put order through.


You are talking abracadabra, for most IRL people I know. (I must admit I do not know how to clear my cookies on my smartphone myself, probably because I never do anything using the browser).
When your (CC like) 'pin' card gets stolen you phone the bank, they'll block it and any funds that are missing (if someone caught / taped you putting in your pin) you'll get all the money back. And you don't risk any funds yourself when your phone gets stolen (for example when someone snatches it just while you are going to pay, in which case with BTC you just lost all your money).

Imagine Paypal (not likely, but technically very possible) dumping their own internal currency and having people pay for stuff online in their native fiat currency (or whatever they want actually) and the website receiving money in their native currency. So basically Bitinstant with a way for consumers to pay with anything they like.
This way that provider would use Bitcoin to swap the currencies under the hood but no party has to deal with anything related to blockchains, wallets, addresses, etc.
@_date: 2013-07-04 22:12:08
You make a valid point, but the more fiat getting pumped into the foundation of bitcoin (the miners &amp; the network) the more stable Bitcoin will become. Everyone who invests $ into Bitcoin has a big financial incentive to see Bitcoin rise. This is especially true for expensive ASIC hardware which can do nothing but hash SHAs really fast. By spreading not only shares but also hardware this incentive is increased massively which in turn make AM worth way more fiat.
@_date: 2013-07-20 16:14:14
I agree that people ranting on how unsafe Bitcoin is are spreading FUD. By the way I read the paper and large parts of the source code. Just like people did supposedly read the open source crypto messenger called cryptocat and all ['encrypted' communications are out there on the street]( (for everyone who has the encrypted data).
Crypto is extremely hard and no software system can ever be 100% safe. In the crypto community (you know they guys Statoshi discussed the original idea with) there are people seriously scared of some governments having bruteforced some algos Bitcoin is using already but keeping it to themselves for now. (most is paranoia but still).
It wouldn't be a black swan if I (dev, non crypto guy without having done 10 years of research in crypto) could find a weak spot in Bitcoin. I don't think this will happen at all, but I do think the chance is way bigger than the whole fiat system collapsing and everyone jumping the bitcoin train.

I mean that when she is broke she can leave her wallet in the table. Regardless of how many cash there is going to be in a year from now. It get' pretty complicated when she just won a lotto and a large sum of BTC will get transfered to her wallet.


I have to agree that my research was flawed, as I was under the impression that the priv keys could be retrieved from the device.


Okay so I guess she has something to protect at any point in time for if she ever gets a large sum of BTC. It becomes pretty easy to torture the poor little girl for the seed / device / whatever when the robbers can get away with it pretty easily (like the at this point pseudonymous way the network is set up). 


Depends on your point of view, in any way current inflation is much more desired than volatility for everyone trying to keep assets in. In my point of view bitcoin inflated over 50% since april 6th this year.


Ya I heard they are pretty decentralized and easily transferable. This is basically making notes that stand for gold (like the dollar did).


Admitted, but I am not saying Bitcoin is not for consumers. It just isn't right now because of a combination of current techology (like stuff different from NFC), adoption, legislation (haven't even brought up this one yet, it's quite a big one), etc.
