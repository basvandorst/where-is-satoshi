This is why, despite everything done to reassure people of their safety, I haven't used an exchange since Gox went down. It's been proven to me, time and time again, that an offline wallet is the best way to store crypto. It's the only way to guarantee ownership and control.

Coinbase is highly relevant. It provides a doorway for fiat investors with minimal cognitive load. That and its suite of merchant tools, once again, provides an interface to integrate existing payment systems.

I think the idea is to invest it in something more tangible. Like land?
Why would you do anything less? :P
It's always confused me.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:46:40
The issues are mainly due to the low levels of technical literacy in the general population. I second that Coinbase are a vital part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They've spent countless hours making sure their UX design is top notch and easy to understand. 
It's thanks to them that the value has risen so much. They lend credibility to the endeavour when a lot of other exchanges give people the bare minimum in terms of service.

This is why I use a trezor. I don't trust anything, least of all you! *points to mirror*

This is going to push up the price by an insane amount. 
I also expect zipzap to capitalize on the lack of competition currently available for hardware wallets. 
Invest in coins or stock, can't decide which.

Incoming price hike.

How high did he bounce? ;p
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:16:11
It will probably return to the mean rate soon.

In reality, it's safer to just sit tight. There's profit to be made but security ought to win when it comes to decision making on a long term investment.
Keep in mind that there are stores selling items for BTC. Informed people will begin buying in BTC long before dumping all their currency if they truly believed it was a permanent crash. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:33:31
Yes, the whole point of BTC was to circumvent the fact that the Yuan does not float freely. Sell now and buy again once people become aware of that fact. :]
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:56:24
Ladies and gentlemen, BOING!
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:23:14
The entire point of BTC was to circumvent Chinese banks in the first place because they don't allow the Yuan to float freely/ ;]
Remember and buy again in an hour.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:10:32
Sell now and buy again in 20 minutes on the bounce. The whole point of Bitcoin in China was to circumvent the government and banks in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:22:28
The easiest way to purchase Peercoin and/or Litecoins would be to go via the Cryptsy website and send BTC to your account there for direct trade. 
I would not advise either of those coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:33:56
Given the rate of adoption and interest in the West, for every BTC they sell, the more they cripple themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:04:43
Getting out of the kitchen is exactly what the Chinese are doing. : ]
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:13:15
Preferably do all this on a netbook you purchased exclusively to use as your main BTC vault. Only go online to update the blockchain and transfer.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:09:23
You're right, China made a huge mistake with their announcement. There's been a displacement of wealth today which they will suffer for once the value of BTC reaches maturity. The Chinese, for all intents and purposes, owned Bitcoin but now they have literally given the rest of the world a chance to claim a stake. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:28:22
Still waiting for a decent hardware wallet to come out. I might buy a dedicated offline netbook with encrypted usb backups as my main storage medium, connecting only briefly to update the chain.
Paper is all well and good but you can't send from it, right? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:48:00
Because they confuse the market and leech credence from the main currency, BTC. That and they'll never be accepted by retailers. 
Pump and dump speculation. As BTC goes up, so do they. When it goes down, people think the value has been displaced to an alt coin but it hasn't, it's general confidence in the crypto medium that gets damaged.
The only alt currency I'd even think twice about is protoshares and even that has got a lot to prove.

A normal flash drive can still be compromised but the trezor is built in such a way that the private key can't be accessed by the computer it is plugged into. It's a hardware design rather than a software prevention. 
See more hardware wallets here:

As long as confidence is distributed evenly, the currency will be ok. At the moment, it's at the mercy of Chinese investment.
If more countries buy in, it will reduce the risk substantially. We need to hit some sort of critical mass, after which the rate of adoption will, as you say, make what we've seen so far look like a shallow curve. ;]
It's 'legal' in Germany now. More to follow.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:00:54
This was a silly move on their part but one i intend to profit from. The biggest holders of the currency were the Chinese and, for all intents and purposes, they owned it. What is happening now is the biggest transfer of Bitcoin wealth in the history of the currency and gives other countries an opportunity to have a stake in things.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:53:49
Good news for me as I sold about 10 minutes ago and once I hit the save button below I'm buying again. : ]
Good doing business with you all!
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:50:14
Get ready for another bounce chaps!
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:00:31
Recent news has raised value to all time high.
Original miners/investors cashing out on their profits
Newcomers investing in currency for first time.
Savers are selling, buyers are spending.
More BTC in circulation, more trade
Increase in value of BTC once original investors have sold their assets, it's currently quite stable.
Oh, and incoming news of Chinese exchange attempting to have Bitcoin regulated as legal tender. They might not succeed but the fact that they're trying will increase its value.
