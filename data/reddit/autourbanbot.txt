*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***Gatekeeping***]( : 


_"I love punk bands like Green Day!"_
_"Ugh, they're not even punk. They totally sold out."_
_"Oh man, I love Harry Potter. I am such a geek!"_
_"Hardly. Talk to me when you're into theoretical physics."_
_"Erika Moen is my favorite queer cartoonist."_
_"She's not queer, she married a man!"_
_"Quit your gatekeeping. No one died and made you Queen of the Gays!"_
