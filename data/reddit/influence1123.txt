Wait. I don't get why that is a switcharoo. If it is it went waaay over my head. Charles Schwab is my broker and I'm not too well versed in the ways of brokerage firms and their uses. Think you would mind explaining a little more. What is a ticker? Sorry if I sound completely naive. haha

I was gonna buy more coins, but then I got high.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:37:41
That was a surprisingly good movie

In my books this is a plus. I think it is a good thing being able to see when large amounts of money are moved because it affects us all. This isn't an issue for the everyday person though because the smaller and less high profile your bitcoin wallets and usage of those wallets is the less chance that people will be watching them are. I think the more money and power someone has the more they should be scrutinized and vice versa. Which is kind of the opposite of how things are now.

Really? How do I get in on that?

I think hes just happy about the outcome of his investment and being able to be apart of this new revolutionary thing that is bitcoin and wanted to share those feelings.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:29:06
I think its because he thinks its crazy that people would go out of their way to pay with bitcoin when it should be that people buy things with bitcoin because its actually easier to do so not just because. However he isn't taking into account that at this stage of bitcoins life most of the people getting into bitcoin went out of their way to do so and now want places to spend those coins but are having trouble finding places to do so. This would be awesome for people who have that problem. Sound right @_date: 2013-12-10 02:40:44
Good thinking though
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:17:33
cool thanks. Awesome app
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:58:30
could not have
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:51:51
I see nothing there like he just said
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:52:56
I'd put money there not sure how it would have to be started though. I would imagine someone would have to have a good amount of money to start with and get some kind of licences. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:36:27
Just kidding. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:05:29
I don't understand why you are so passionately frustrated about this. Sure it seems that generally calling congress doesn't really do shit but why are you so adamantly against doing it? It certainly won't hurt. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:28:33
I have a feeling your one of those people who likes to pretend like he knows better than everyone else what is going on so makes up things to make it seem like that even to himself.

no on a global scale it cannot and never is forced. The real control that happens is when people are controlled and don't even know it. When people try to forcibly control people is exactly when people fight back.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:04:14
whose manipulating them?
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:13:19
How each individual person acts does affect the whole. Not necessarily directly very much but maybe if one person does what is good and true other people will follow and there is actually real power for change in numbers. Also, "Three things cannot be long hidden, the sun, the moon, and the truth" - The buddha. No matter how much power the people in power have now if they try to fight against what is true they are going to lose eventually. I have faith in this.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:55:53
Ignore the fuck face. Only invest what you are willing to lose. Any amount is worth it.

How would Georodd, and everyone else on the board, step off the board then?
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:27:45
Someone post an address so I can test it out
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:40:26
+$5 verify
I'll have you know I got a bitcointip wallet just to give this to you. You deserve much more but I have a feeling that with a mind like yours you have found ways to get more elsewhere anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:50:08
interesting take on it; I like it. You can't fully understand what you are doing wrong without seeing a true, actually fundamentally different (and hopefully better) alternative
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:27:34
What? None of that means anything.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:21:24
Yes that is being worked on and this is a step toward that. This does make bitcoin easier to spend untill amazon starts accepting it. It doesn't make bitcoin more accesible or more attractive to get, other things are doing that, but it will make bitcoins people do get easier to spend. Also if a lot of people start using it amazon might see that and start accepting it themselves.
