Whatever you do, DO NOT work with the wallet file directly!!!
Make a few copies RIGHT NOW on multiple separate storage media and then work with one of the copies.
Then, download the official Bitcoin Core client [here]( Install it on a partition that has at least 200 (or more) gigabytes free.
After, start it up so it can start synching the blockchain. This is necessary so the directory structure is created.
Then, shutdown the client completely (from the file menu). A window will pop up telling you not to shut down the PC while it's still displaying. When that window vanishes, go into the directory where the (new, just created) wallet file is and replace that one with one of the backups you made of the old one earlier.
Now start the client back up again and let it sync... depending on when you made transactions, those should begin getting confirmed soonish.
Any questions? Again, DO NOT fuck around with the original you found, work with a copy!

Are you saying that you're STILL USING the affected HDD/SDD???
1st rule of data recovery: stop all write processes on the drive you want to recover data from.
How about putting the drive into an enclosure and then trying to recover after connecting it to some other PC via USB?

Those bankers' names? Einstein. Every single one of them except for the Ke$ha one.

That's good!
As others have told you, it's best to clone the drive in its current state and try the recovery of files on the copy rather than on the source drive.
