What do you stand to gain?
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:23:39
Dude are you in the US? I don't know about other countries, but you can absolutely get a bank account, and even a credit card without verifying income.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:24:53
Is bitcoin set up in a way where these issues can be solved as time goes on?
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:22:25
Man's gotta eat, right?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:57:30
he has .11 BTC. I dont think its the end of the world
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:47:55
People have and they will. Some people just don't learn
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:32:45
Lol nothing like some bitcoin talk to get in the mood!
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:48:43
Kool thanks! Is there any direct financial incentive for these developers?
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:20:17
Thanks bud!
@_date: 2014-08-24 04:51:50
The guy in the middle is the 3rd party processor that takes a cut
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:15:39
And then he said, fuck it, let me rob whatever's left too?
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:56:49
To a value of 0 tho? A handful of users will prop it above zero
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:53:41
Wow. Perfect example of why it doesn't matter what their intentions are. No single entity should have that much power.  I would have expected something like that would have driven people away.
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:07:11
Can someone ELI5 what he means by this?
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:54:33
Pre-post recession I would assume too
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:06:10
Countdown towards nothing? Damn bitcoin needs to do something...
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:28:42
Phones would have an email like 12345 or something like that. If you look it up I'm sure you can find it

My Android is telephony, but it can do a lot more than make calls
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:08:03
It's scary for a reason. You really don't want to place your entire future in one risky speculation. Don't get fucking greedy. That's how people get burned
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:16:31
Lol how much does a fist bump go for these days?
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:08:09
Even time counting the money for each transaction is a factor
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:35:24
I haven't kept track of this at all. If anyone's explored, are these mostly transactions to and from exchanges, or are they going to gambling sites?
Are people of wealth actually using this to move hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Anyone dig into the transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:25:37
It's just like reddit!
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:30:57


haha oops. I just feel like there are absolutely excellent uses for bitcoin, but people seem to think bitcoin is the best thing ever for everything!
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:13:22

I actually set an alarm for 4 but slept through it...
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:09:02
Unfortunately, the only real retort is that they have alternate malign intentions
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:15:44
The only argument I can see is that, if they can even squeeze an extra 1% saving on fees, it would do incredible things for their financials
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:17:50
Ohh ok that makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-04 11:34:55
There's absolutely zero way it would completely crash and burn and I'm confident in saying that. I actual wasn't until this thread right noe. There is literally no force in the world that can take it to zero. The real experiment IMO is how far can we push it? 
It has already established its place in various international and underground markets and as wealth storage. Whether it reaches mass adoption is another question, but there is no doubt it will keep being used to make certain transactions over the Internet (poker, drugs etc) as it is the easiest and cheapest way hands down.
The infrastructure will never fail as there is direct financial incentive to keep it running by miners. Granted that assumes bitcoins have value, so I'm kind of begging the question there, but people were buying gox coins even after they declared insolvency. We're a resilient bunch.
Barring a fatal security flaw that somehow hasn't been discovered yet (I'm not fully there on the backend stuff, but I feel like that's highly improbable) there's nothing that can stop this. An object in motion likes to stay in motion. And we got a lotta inertia going.  
Ninja edit: the only reason I still don't invest more than I can lose - I'm still waiting for a dedicated hardware wallet (where u at trezor?). I would either lose/damage the keys or get it stolen by an incompetent exchange.  Plus I wouldn't be able to handle those swings lol
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:59:42
lol I know...bitcoin finds a way
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:35:22
Isn't this just really stupid? You don't have to ask for bitstamp to implement a minimum lol. You don't like the larger fees on small transactions, then just make sure you trade &gt; 5$ on your own.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:06:48
You should get your stutter checked out
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:07:53
Are there any known vulnerabilities of 2fa? It seems pretty foolproof
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:52:33
don't forget the regular fees too!
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:45:37
Honestly, is it really that easy to coordinate a double spend attack that's worth sacrificing their business?
Could they really send all transactions to their addresses with just a simple code?
Genuinely curious
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:03:15
$424 on amazon prime, plus you probably spent 1% premium through coinbase. Well done
Edit: I now see u mined them so I take the 1% back
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:33:09
True. Is it easy to catch a double spend attack in action? i.e. any idea how long it could take to spot it?
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:37:34
Dude don't even bother...
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:35:09
Oops I missed the zero confirmation. I guess that's ultimately the betting sites fault. Rookie mistake
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:41:15
Thanks for the link. I was struggling to find a ready hardware wallet. Is that essentially cold storage though?
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:06:25
Same thing day before with Bitcorn
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:00:58
I'm conflicted.
OK, look, I can see why this would be adopted by big business, and why you as an entrepreneur filled this need. And yes, I can actually see why, in a way, bitcoin needs this to become mainstream. 
But can you admit that this defeats one of the fundamental concepts of bitcoin?
Well one question, if you tumble the bitcoins from a "tainted" address, is there any way to link back to that? i.e. could this kill bitcoins use in Silk Road?
(PS: Any chance you could use a *remote* CSR?)
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:35:05
Where the hell did you get june?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:29:52
Wait, but if you were banned from the internet, then what are you doing on Reddit?!?! How can this sorcery e?
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:49:51
I guess the last bubble has treated you well
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:11:09
Good job wasting your time.
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:39:39
Sorry I'm tired.. The funds can then be transferred to a bank account which can then be used to purchase through Coinbase etc. It's a 2step process...
I hope this makes sense
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:31:16
Wildcard bitches!
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:53:09
Excellent use!
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:45:43
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:25:40
Haha just curious. Thanks for the tip I'll be sure to pass it on. 
Yep went through fine..your bots on its game
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:51:49
Why don't you take a look at your math again...
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:30:53
I'll show you a hard currency ;)
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:24:57
I understand that, but companies like having a name standing behind the payment. Many reasons. "Hold responsible" isn't just about getting paid...
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:33:48
If you don't charge fees, how do any of you guys make money?
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:47:09
He's just speculating
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:23:06
do you work for a bitcoin company, or has it expanded?
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:48:54
What things have the most resistance from clients?
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:20:18
Well they're not wrong imo...
Bitcoin has it value, but right now it shouldn't be anywhere near an established banking system.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:47:27
Not true for the last part. They would still want a person and address they can hold responsible for the payment if any issue arrives 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:11:09
money belt? That's not important
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:41:08
Who's the dude in the corner? I recognize him....
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:37:19
Can I use this in conjunction with an online wallet? Or is getting multiple cards my only form of backup?
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:27:30


Was that confirmed?
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:36:31
Why the fuck are we still talking about this guy!?
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:55:49
Thanks! (cough*peopleactuallyuseourcoins*cough)
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:05:27
As a customer I don't. They are just doing what they should be doing anyways. This gox thing just made us more aware of possible issues
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:29:56
It's about sticking it to the man, man!
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:43:25
Can someone with lower morals post the whole message?
Edit: if anyone's interested coindesk has a list
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:01:50
necessity is the mother of invention. The same thing will happen with the 1mb thing
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:12:23
Why are you even buying bitcoins?
It doesn't seem like it's for you...
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:55:23
Personally, I think the money should be put to a more efficient use by supporting charities and the like. That would really put Bitcoin in a positive light in the public eye. You can do a lot with 14k, and I don't know if Bitcoin will get that much exposure from this.
But I also didn't donate, so I really have no say in where it goes...
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:07:47
Hint: They won't
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:56:03
Is it possible to just buy the domain + IP?
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:58:38
Yep, same way you pay 50 cents for an item.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:56:42
Isn't is incredibly easy to change your IP?
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:41:14
he was the worst
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:29:36
It honestly kinda is these days. It's all about faith in the dollar
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:21:42
How dangerous is it to use bitcoins on an open wifi?
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:29:14
"I love lamp" 
"do you really love lamp or are you just saying that?"
"I-I love lamp"
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:32:43
I know that's policy. But if a obvious professional business traveler comes in late saying he's been robbed and only has cash (somehow hidden), will the manager just waive it, or will they actually turn him away?
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:42:09
Try talking to some companies about sponsorship
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:22:55
IMHO we're really not ready for bits yet, but I hope that comes soon. And I guess it will be good to establish that term for when it is more relevant.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:43:42
You'd find GHash splitting their pool, to always make sure that one half is number 4
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:34:31
Could be the bystander effect?
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:02:42
I would think implementing a fee would be greedy...Do they just make money selling cloudmining?
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:43:19
Did I miss the boat?
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:52:35
Nice that's a big step and I think you'll see great response on all sides. Keep up the good work guys! Doing big things to bring it mainstream
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:53:10
I think a tiny button in the corner would be a good way. Small enough where the average customer wont even notice, but if someone is familiar with bitcoins, they would know what to look for and it would catch their eye
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:25:14
worse than not having access to money? dumbass...
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:18:26
Big sale buddy, don't mess up!
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:56:06
There's a huge difference between the two
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:22:10
Even I think you have a problem
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:08:44
Meh, keep working at it. There could be potential in you
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:41:51
There is still that brand recognition in the consumers mind. "any publicity is good publicity" etc etc. 
Plus they are probably gettin the company for pennies on the dollar of its real value
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:57:14
Interesting thank you. It seems like it is still might be more efficient than whatever systems we have now
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:24:50
Aren't the miners ultimately processing transactions or something? Or are they just arbitrarily created problems?
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:49:35
How much will it cost?
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:16:44
just curious why not? Are there no services large enough?
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:06:53
Seriously. We know who exactky Karpeles is. Lotta fucking good that did...
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:24:48
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:08:54
I'm pretty sure I've seen this comment on every single post about it...
And why were you talking about bitcoin with your friend in the shower?
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:41:59
It kinda is
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:49:06
Luckily the "why" isn't always important
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:39:05
bitcoin =/= exchanges
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:57:37
Bro what's the one rule of any investment/gamble? 
DON'T PUT ALL YO EGGS IN ONE BASKET!
Theoretically at 30% loss vs 40% gain, you would come out ahead in the long run, but you didn't take variance into the equation.
EDIT: What did I do wrong with my math?
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:34:38
Can you explain the reasoning behind this? Thanks
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:41:00
Any entry level positions? I'm a smart young person who doesn't have an extensive resume, but I know if you give me a chance I can prove my intelligence. Should I take the test anyways? I know the bitcoin fundamentals.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:56:26
So what you're saying is no one else is looking to mix 500,000 coins?
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:00:58
This ain't dogecoin
@_date: 2014-06-30 10:23:07
I love it. I'm sick of seeing "My new amateur webdesign company accepts bitcoin!"
This is an excellent use, and I wish you all the best.


What is it going to take to allow them to send fiat to fiat, with bitcoin as the intermediary? Can you partner with an exchange? Because I doubt many of these migrant workers already have bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-05-26 11:52:12
sell it.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:40:07
Do they at least let you withdraw if they shut down your account?
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:15:50
was it treated as a cash advance on your credit card?
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:17:31
IIRC, I believe that I used to send mms messages with pictures etc to my email just by typing it in as the recipient. I don't have a dumb phone so I can't say for sure, but I'm sure someone still has one of those
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:07:13
That's probably because everyone's selling their coins lol
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:36:07
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:08:17
and that's called taking an analogy way too far
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:48:24
I think you are 21.co...
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:59:43
wait, who't that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:58:46

@_date: 2013-12-07 09:08:52
Everyone talking about BitPay is right about businesses being able remove risk. But the buyer market faces the same issues about not wanting to spend when they don't really know how much they are spending.
It is far to confusing and complicated for everyone involved as far as regular transactions until the price stablizes.
There is no real value, so it's just whatever people want to say it is
