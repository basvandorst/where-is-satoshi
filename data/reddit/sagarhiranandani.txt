I moved coins after fork to bittrex and added copay private keys to electron cash. Well leave it mate, will find out some way this weekend. Thanks a lot for your support :) 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:20:35
I already tried that, but when I enter seed words the next button is not enabled. I don't know what's wrong. And what to select in beginning: standard or digital wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:35:13
Thanks for your response! 
But I haven't made any mistakes and no spaces, still button not enabled. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:30:51
I really hated everytime when I see this gif on bitcoin sub. Today, I thought, let's try it! I really(and probably others) don't know what will be the price in next few minutes/hrs. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:20:30
I don't know what's wrong. I selected the server and also tried in coinomi wallet, but still same thing, 0 balance. Btw, I transfered my btc from copay to bittrex after split, is that a problem? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:24:37
Thanks! Will try that. Btw already covered about 21 limit. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:02:25
Firstly, sorry buddy for troubling you. Well, while checking the server list in electron, there are bunch of it. I don't know which to select, total noob here. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:49:02
Thank you so much for your time!
Firstly, I haven't used electrum wallet to transfer btc. What I did is, I moved my btc from copay to bittrex exchange wallet and with that btc wallet private key I added it in electron cash.

@_date: 2017-08-15 19:22:37
What would you answer to those? Just curious. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:26:15
Thanks buddy! Already covered few of them. Trying to add more slides. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:44:39
I tried it with private key instead of seed. The wallet got added but with 0 balance, anything I did wrong? 
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:48:00
Just my assumption, not based on data or something. 
But still Human psychology and traders set limit to 50's &amp; 100's
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:42:21
5k would be the first stop
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:07:00
Just goto localbitcoins com and select payment option to PayPal! Simple as that. :) 
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:34:02
Crazy redditors! Erghhh
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:42:25
Bitpanda?? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:34:07
Hey I need help reading bitpanda if you already having a account 
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:29:07
Totally correct! We will be just spending bitcoins for stuffs, like we use fiat nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:07:48
So soothing! ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:56:34
He was HODLing 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:21:05
Yeaaa ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:57:46
I totally agree with you, no one knows what happens next. Just hodl or sell or buy or do whatever you feel. If everyone feels the price will go up and major public buys, it will go up, doesn't matter what those analysis say. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:00:46
I like it, but I would have loved it if up was chosen ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:55:22
Everyone thinks this pattern will be keep following, buy dip sell high, and loop. People who think by doing this they will earn good, believe me the price will skyrocket in no time and have to buy at higher rates. So HODL. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:47:26
You are expecting a lot from tech!

Blockfolio, the best! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:36:42
Not a bull trap, but a pure bull run. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:30:02
Thank you :) 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:56:26
Haven't stolen the post ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:41:22
I see another great party soon, just after hangover! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:59:56
The bitcoin just reflected now in wallet after reinstalling. Thanks a lot for your response and help! I love this community! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:21:53
People are falling in the trap, thinking it's a bull trap. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:14:17
Keep in mind that there is no replay protection 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:36:18
I already use breadwallet, will I able to get both coins after fork? And how? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:53:00
Or maybe I am confused with segwit2x ��
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:55:24
I have did reinstalling and adding seed words, but still same thing
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:22:44
I am looking for the same! Btc price is lower in some markets and very high in others. Now m looking for some European resident who can work with me for arbitrage. There is a huge profit which we are missing! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:42:02
Now buy more at 2000 and again at 1850
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:38:00
I don't think it will go below $2000 or $1900. It will probably go up, so you can buy some now. This is bitcoin world, anything can happen! After your purchase, the value would have been doubled or half, no one knows. Just hodl after you get some. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:50:40
BTC and BCC stored in Bittrex have risk of replay attack? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:05:05
So I can freely exchange the bcc with btc once I get the clone amount without any issues? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:50:28
M not taking about selling and buying again. What if I just HODL the altcoins (not bitcoin). Fork happens, what is the value of those coins? Merely half! Isn't it? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:21:43
I think bitcoin will fall more in coming few hours. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:31:52
Thanks buddy! I try to find every thing I can and at the end, if don't get enough info, I jump to reddit. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:10:08
To d moon! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:50:31
What is PayPal? I only know btc wallet. Haha! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:10:21
The price which is being retrieved is from some exchange? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:41:54
I am currently holding few Cryptocurrency and trade in that. Now the price is down for those coins and I don't want to convert all in bitcoin and keep in the paper wallet. What I have to do now, create separate wallet for all coins?
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:34:31
Hahha that's fine, thanks for your response. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:58:07
Holding in exchange sites are fine right? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:27:13
Alright thanks buddy! I just downloaded copay, is good and secured? It will be fine after aug 1?
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:18:18
How? Please guide this newbie ����
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:19:46
I almost remembered mine
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:50:54
Yes exactly! HODL. Can you see that sticker with upward arrow? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:03:17
Use digital currency for widgets.
