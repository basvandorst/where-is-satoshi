Well, I think it is, I looked at coinbase selling $600 per BTC while they're at %150 in Mtgox

Bitcoins Turning into Buttcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:34:19
I mean, well, when you put it that way. :(

@_date: 2014-02-25 04:19:14
It's still trading in bitstam and coinbase for ~~6~~500 or so 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:35:34
In an unregulated market, the market self regulates, thus, everyone participating is a regulator.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:22:16
Where they supposed to do something that they promised or said they wouldn and again didn't deliver?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:03:13
FREE!! BITCOINS ARE FREE NOW

So, they still haven't finished their orders from all that time ago? damn.

What did BFL do this time? I've been out of the BTC loop.

If this is true it's not a good sign.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:41:33
Bitcoin itself is not broken. You clearly don't know what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:08:29
But you have to have bitcoins in there.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:54:00
the cia is part of the goverment though. They wouldn't start holding themselves accountable now after all these years.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:39:41
They only need those laws for ATT and others helping the NSA.

Well I can't get verified because I live in a U.S. territory. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:03:31
I guess Ill give them a try tomorrow since banks are closed on the 4th. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 03:59:27
Aaaah 2 hours and 34 mins later, it's here, I hope they hurry up and let me up my account to lvl 2!
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:24:02
I have been unable to even have my account "validated" by their "third party" and have been 'ineligible' to use a cash deposit for over 2 weeks now.
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:35:19
level 2 accounts get coins instantly. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:29:20
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-07-09 03:32:47
Bitcoin is beyond gender to me.But facts are facts, Bitcoin is male dominated, nothing wrong with it, unless you feel a need for a female bitcoiner quota.
@_date: 2013-08-11 16:11:29
Agreed, I came here to warn people before throwing their money away.
@_date: 2013-07-04 21:20:10
I'm trying to put money on it since 3 days ago but Bitinstant won't let me use cash deposits, the only option I had.
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:52:24

I can't buy coins on Coinbase instantly and I've been waiting for months, just because I don't live in the continental United States. 
I hate waiting 5 days
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:51:52
Win some and lose some.
@_date: 2013-07-26 05:12:26
Why do people keep screwing themselves over?
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:30:43
This isn't fair, I can't get level 2 verified just because I live in a territory. (PR)

Nobody is selling close to me on local bitcoins. Want me to use things like OKpay.
@_date: 2013-07-27 03:48:13
Thanks also, how can I send them from Coinbase to my wallet?
@_date: 2013-07-30 00:48:52
You have the most upvotes, so I'll ask you, what is a double spend and how do I protect myself from it?
@_date: 2013-07-10 05:14:20
That's kind of why I asked 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:23:42
You need to go through paypal. See if that helps because as far as I understand it, since they 'began shipping', they're not doing refunds.
@_date: 2013-07-27 04:21:22
Yes i think i found it, the 'send to' option.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:31:57
20 years ago was 40 years ago
@_date: 2013-08-02 03:55:49
Ok, I won't, but it's been 2 hours, and I've never had to wait this long, I always used to use bitinstant until they wouldn't let me buy coins from my country anymore. Coincidentally that country is the USA :/

"Bitcoin will survive so long as it acquires legitimacy adhering to the law."
Remember kids, only the government and the system of courts may grant legitimacy.
@_date: 2013-07-04 23:37:56
PR = nothing at all.
@_date: 2013-07-05 00:38:45
That's usually been the *same* experience I've had with them, but now I can't get coins anywhere.
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:53:27
Yes that's good and all, but I am ineligible to use cash deposits, THE ONLY OPTION EVER AVAILABLE TO ME.
@_date: 2013-07-26 07:38:20
One of those that laughed at you could've stolen your idea, never ever tell people shit, just try and fail on your own.
@_date: 2013-07-15 12:53:52
Is it really an insolvency issue like some people think?
@_date: 2013-07-26 05:18:27
Hey man, autistic savants exist.
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:10:57
The website says I am ineligible, I emailed support, they said I have to verify my account with a "quiz", but I cant find it, it wasnt emailed to me, I am lost, really.
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:54:09
Guess I'll have to suck it up.
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:29:48
It's at $99...

Since when do you need tickets to Burning Man? Is it all corporate sponsored now? :(
