There would have to be a whole team of people tipping for that to ever happen. I rarely see the same commenter twice. If OP wanted to experiment with this he apparently has the bankroll to do so, but I would personally have problems sending bitcoins out to people that I've never met. Even though he doesn't expect money back and is relying moreso on the price of bitcoins to rise, what's to stop someone from just running with it? He would have to partner with the creator of bitcointip to make sure the participants aren't able to withdraw the funds for themselves and to restrict the amount that can be tipped so it's not transferred to an alt.

Is this a pretty good site?
edit: How can I go about getting an invite? I'm a power user at what.cd and maintained a 0.8 ratio at demonoid

If I had that much money id rather be a philanthropist.

I also found it funny, but I'm really hungry.

You don't want the value of the bitcoin to increase?

+bitcointip 0.05 BTC
You should start tipping all over reddit with bitcointip and get a bunch of new people onto bitcoins so that the economy can flourish. If a random stranger tipped me with five dollars worth of something I've never heard of I'm probably going to look into it. 
Edit: why didn't my tip go through?

I found someone on bitcointalk. Deleting post now. Thank you though

Seeing as how bitcoins is just an experiment for me, I've been just selling some things online. I sold a bunch of NFC tags I got for free for around 5 BTC. 
Bitinstant.Com?

Is there an email for tpb? I want to see this happen.

If you're not a full-time redditor it might behoove you to contract some regular users to tip people as they see fit for good comments. If you donate 2BTC to the bitcointip bot you can tip users on any subreddit instead of the pre-designated subreddits. So if you were to give 2BTC+ to bitcoin advocates that happen to also be regular reddit users they would help encourage other users to look into bitcoin to redeem their tips and in the best case scenario they will also look into purchasing their own. 
The thing is, if I was tipped a measly 12 cents USD in bitcoins I really wouldn't even bother looking into how to redeem them. If I were tipped five dollars worth however, I would look into what I can spend it on. If after 21 days they don't redeem the bitcoins, it gets refunded anyway. That's what I would do.

Yeah, spending 500 dollars to increase your overall value of bitcoins is just ludicrous when you don't even have a million dollars. What was I thinking.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:21:43
You're right. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:53:05
Thanks for putting it in perspective. I appreciate it.

Super relevant to my interests.

It freaked out my gf and I as well! Scared the shit out of us.

Excuse my ignorance, but is there any chance that this would generate a address and key that are already in use, even if at astronomical odds?

Jesus implemented that feature.
