you are basically describing a bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:07:57
Thanks, we think so too.  We would love your feedback on the product, though.  Any killer feature you'd want to see, anything you don't really care about?
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:00:27
Yes, all 50 states
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:06:00
Yes.  Also, the new domain is sfox.com without the dash
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:57:47
you can think of it as bitcoind for javascript.  But in reality it is more of a library that provides you with the tools to build things that use the bitcoin network in javascript
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:00:55
Thank you, everyone. I'm one of the co-founders of SFOX.com so feel free to ask me any question about the product. Or if you have any feedback I'd love to hear it. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:08:15
I recommend checking out  and the fees are 0.25% right now.  SFOX also takes ACH deposits, so no wire fees.  Not to mention that with them, you get to trade on bitfinex and bitstamp.
If you signup, pm me your email address and I'll send you an invitation to trade

Not to mention that patent law has changed from first-to-invent from first-to-file.  So it doesn't matter if you discover it first, if someone else file a patent before you then they'll get the patent.
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:10:51
We use ACH for both deposits and withdrawals
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:37:48


It's actually easier than that. AMEX let's me dispute txs online. I don't know about visa/MC because I rarely use them, but the reason you gave in the quotes is enough to reverse anything with amex
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:47:52
how is this different though?
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:18:10
But that's the thing, they require you to know who your customer is
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:32:59
thanks for the question. regulation is always the  concern for any bitcoin company in the US. That's why we worked on that before we even started coding.  This post is just to get people's feedback on what we have built and see what else to build next.  We will be sharing more information on regulation very soon. we will keep you guys posted once that's public info
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:41:58
Fraud usually happens when the customer leaves the establishment. There's no social-pressure unless one is trying to defraud a place they frequent, in which case one is not a very good fraudster.
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:49:43
thanks. would love to get your feedback on the site though. what did you think? what features do you find missing? any questions left unanswered after visiting the site?
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:10:13
checkout  fees are 0.25% and they aggregate liquidity from bitstamp and bitfinex.  It doesn't get more liquid than that.  They also have ach deposits
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:14:54
we've added the logout button
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:36:51
PHP is fine for many tasks, an exchange is not one of them.
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:05:38
My first thought was what said, where we send out an email every time something changes with the account.  But I think we need to add more than that.  I'll come back to you with a few ideas once I've thought them through.
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:29:49
No, it doesn't :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:51:42
Thank you for that, glad you like it.  Logout is definitely one of the things we're planning on adding.  
And don't worry about us changing the addresses, never our intention.  We just want bitcoin to grow and reach an even wider audience.  There will be more security features added soon as well.
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:12:50
No, we use the order book from all the exchanges we are connected to in order to figure out the best execution strategy for your order
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:50:02
hopefully, this will be the answer to people/businesses like you: 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:40:37
I never said the merchants will be fine with any fraud.  All I said was, if the bitcoin fraud levels don't exceed what they're used to (and trust me, they experience fraud with credit cards/checks) then this is not an issue for them.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:08:59
We're starting with btc for now, but we will add more in the future depending on the demand
@_date: 2014-04-19 04:04:25
I doubt it, but he's most likely referring to getting a whole bunch of spam emails to this day
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:12:13
sorry, will fix it soon
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:25:35
So would you want it to auto rotate the default key every time it receives a payment? Or do you want that to be an option for you to do manually?
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:39:12
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:13:11
Haha, thanks but I find this incredibly helpful actually. I love it, this is the best way to find out what features would benefit users the most. 
Keep'em coming, guys.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:14:10
added qr codes and clickable addresses
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:43:54
The key is to minimize fraud. B&amp;M have very small amount of fraud so as long as btc fraud doesn't exceed that in % they'll be fine with it. Online credit card fraud is HUGE and companies spend a ton of money just to get it down to single digits
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:33:56
So my initial goal for cointag is not to replace your default wallet at all, but rather to provide an easy way to reference an address for someone. 
One place where I thought this would be useful is when donating to someone. I see this a lot on websites and forums where people list their donation address in their signature. Do instead I thought it would useful to reference your cointag.
But it's starting to sound like address rotation is an important feature to many users. So maybe I should add it to the roadmap
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:47:55
That is definitely in the plan. but I wanted to get this out first to get people's feedback and prioritize accordingly.  So, short answer is yes, this is coming at one point.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:09:51
Yes you can. I might've misunderstood, but I thought you wanted it to auto-rotate the keys
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:09:42
correctly me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there are any crypto exchanges in egypt, so how are you guys trading btc?  is it localbitcoin or something like it?
@_date: 2016-06-09 23:34:15
it is much easier to do price arbitrage on  than what you're describing
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:06:02
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:29:31
not yet.  but sfox is the exchange of exchanges.  with your 1 sfox account you get access to all the exchanges
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:02:07
true, but adam3us should not propose LN as a solution to the blockchain's limitation in that case
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:06:34
it doesn't matter how many open source projects are out there for it.  that doesn't speak to how de/centralized it is going to end up being.  Even the original developers will admit as much.  Take Joseph Poon's comment right here:   He says that "Bob" has to be "really really rich".    
That "has to be rich" part will force the market to be centralized *in practice*.  There will be several "Bob"s out there, but people will gravitate towards the few rich, and with the most users.  Because, the bottom line is that "Bob" is a marketplace.  So if you want to sell your product/service you will choose to work with the hub that has the most users or the one that is disliked least.    
Also, keep in mind that I like the LN.  I'm just not trying to fool myself into thinking that it's not something that it clearly is.  That being said, I can't wait for it to be a reality.
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:24:30
a) it's not superior, and b) if you're against increasing the block size because you think it'll increase centralization then you shouldn't advocate a work around that is all about centralization. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:05:15
that's just not true. Bitcoin xt is also open source, that doesn't mean it's all good. 
in practice, LN will be centralized otherwise it is no different from a regular payment channel. people will gravitate towards a handful of hubs. it's the same problem we've had with mining pools
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:26:40
this is awesome! 
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:08:05
Probably for using/mentioning uml. No one should use uml, I don't even know of any enterprise using uml diagrams anymore
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:02:08
Pass the pipe, please
