Thank you very much for the nice explanation, guys. I suspected it will be somehow related to this new fork.

Thank you very much for this.
I'm trying to better understand the LN, but at the beginning of this explanation it says:


But what if someone broadcasts the old balance sheet transaction and also some new transaction that spends his old balance output (let's call it "evil transaction"). Then nodes broadcast the anti-cheat transaction of course, but how can you be sure that the anti-cheat transaction gets mined first? What prevents this "evil transaction" from beeing mined before the anti-cheat transaction? What am I missing here?

Grandpa, what's "government"?

You thought you'd buy and the price would just magically never go down after that? If you ever checked the chart you should know that's just not how it works... Seriosuly though, people sometimes lose millions on such price movements and they still belive in the idea and you come here and complain over $25 lose and decide that it makes BTC a garbage currency... If that's your attitude you shouldn't be investing in... anything really

I'm not an expert so correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it possible for the 21% of miners to prevent any block size increase/decrease from happening by just voting for increase from 1mb to 1mb (or 1,001 mb) or decrease from 1mb to 1mb (or 0,999 mb) for example? How does it work exactly?
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:51:30
I don't quite understand how miners would profit from doing this 21% attack. Can anyone explain?

Hey, I told you first! :(

Oh, how could I miss that! Thank you.

Actually it is 0.0585% not 0.000585% so the increase to 2% wouldn't make it jump 3400 times, but 34 assuming that the price would increase exactly proportional to number of users. But it probably wouldn't.

I'm suprised noone posted this quote yet.

What's wrong with op's math?
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:04:23
He can actually have a CMS with an editor that would replace multiple spaces with non-breaking ones, so he didn't necessarily do it intentionally. Although he probably did.
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:41:38
Crash? Really? It wasn't even close to a crash.

I just saw a lot of misunderstanding here, that I feel I can clear out a bit for you, so here's my few cents:


Actually the furute of bitcoin is still not clear, but they are a lot of approaches to solve this, like Lighting Network (where blockchain would mostly be used as settlement layer and the transactions would be happening outside of it, so the fees would be divided since one blockchain transactions would mean many more real transactions. They would still be secure and trustless, but that's a very wide topic, so you can read about it somewhere by yourself if you're interested) or simply - bigger blocks (which would mean more transactions in one block, so the fees would not need to be so high, cuz there could be more transactions in each block. Even today the network is full of transactions that are not immiedietly confirmed, so increasing the block size would mean a miner could put more transactions into the block and make more profit without the need for fees to get higher. And it is expected that in the future there will be probably much more people using bitcoin than today, since it's still a relatively new technology).


The network, the electricity and time that is used to mine it, kind of... rareness? (limited supply that can't be tampered)... You can come up with many things. Mostly by idea and people's believes, as everything is.


Well... no. There are many ways to buy bitcoin. Online exchanges are probably the most popular and if you choose to buy them there, you surely do have to give personal information (but that would be the case with most things that you want to buy on the internet I suppose ;)). But 10% transaction fee? Never heared of that. Transaction fees there are usually like 0,1-0,5%.


As I said before, there are many ways to buy bitcoin, and so there are many ways to sell it. If you wish to do it on some online exchange, the transaction fee would be probably like 0,1-0,5% and you would also need to pay withdrawal fee, which is mostly like 1%, but depends on the exchange really.
Besides, if you want to buy bitcoin just to move money from place A to place B and than cash out immiedietly than you don't really take full advantage of it as a means of payment by itself, do you? Sure, maybe there are not too many places where you can buy things with bitcoin right now, but there are more and more every year. As I said, this is a relatively new technology.


That's the case with everything you buy or sell. I think the point is - once someone sends bitcoins to you and the transaction have a few confirmations on the blockchain, you don't have to trust anyone that you own those bitcoins. There is no bank or middle man that keeps them for you. They are pretty much "locked" in the network, unless suddenly most of the miners decide to mine against you and that would probably never be profitable to anyone and yea... I don't think it ever happened.


You can drop a hundred dollars on the street, but whose fault will be that?


As I said - there are many ways to get them. Quick example: Bitcoin ATM.


No, it's actually bullshit. It usally takes 10 minutes for 1 confirmation. It may take more or less. With each confirmation it becomes more secure. In 30-60 minutes it usually becomes quite safe. Exchanges would mostly rely on 3 confimations for example.


That's the only reason this technology even makes sense. But I get that you may not quite understand that.


If you mean transaction fees - it's not like someone cuts the way of your transaction to take the fee. You decide what fee will be and send it with the transaction to encourage miners to include it in the next block. They are not the middle man in the sense that they ever directly recieve the amount you sent. Just the fee. The Open Source code that you so much do not care about makes sure of that.


True. The difference is, if you have your bitcoin private key with you by any means and an internet connection (true, you need that), noone can really stop you from using them at this point, since, as I said - there is no middle man in bitcoin. Only huge, decentralized network. If you have a credit card, your bank can always refuse to make the transaction or lock your card for some reason. You only have a tool that can allow you to access your money. But that depends on your bank, too. If you have your bitcoin private key, internet connection, some device and the right knowleage, you do not really depend on anyone. It's a bit closer to having physical cash.


Maybe not that, but they could probably figure some things out. Depends on your knowleage of the blockchain and how you use it really.


These days doesn't seem to be much of a problem, does it?


Why would you want inflation?


That's also the case with every form of currency. With credit card you chose to use a middle man, and with bitcoin you can do it also. But with bitcoin you may program some stuff, so that for example - if a transaction has 3 confirmations something is automatically sent to you (like an online good). Such program could also be Open Source so you could compile it yourself and be sure that it works this way. That's just an example.


Right now? I don't know. As an investment and store of value maybe (not the only one of course). I'd say it's a technology with great potential and a lot of possible future use cases. You can read some books about it and decide for yourself. I wouldn't judge it just by the usability it has as of today. Today it may be just an interesting thingy, tomorrow it may be THE thingy.

How do you know when they will be margin called (or at which price they were opened) just by looking at this chart? It only tells you how much btc is on short over time. Could be that many shorts closed and many other were open the same day and on the chart you can't really determine which day (and at what price) any of these 17k were opened. Or am I missing something? What is this based on?
