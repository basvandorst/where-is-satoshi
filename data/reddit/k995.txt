Yeah you do realise it was that money that drove the price up in the first place?

Nope 9million last Saturday. Up to almost 20000/minute at peak. So that's not even half an hour at peak times.

What technology?
I can understand the comparison to something like gold+speculation but claiming people are buying into bitcoin for the tech is just total BS. 
There is no product nothing behind and nothing coming out of any value anywhere in the near future.
Apple you buy for the tech and added value of the stock, bitcoin you buy because in all likelyhood the price will still go up for a few months as new people feed it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:54:28
Then btc would have to take over.in significant part of economy. Its basic property's prohibit just that.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:20:29


No they dont, stop saying bitcoin if you mean blockchain they are diferent things.
Its like saying ford when you mean car. 
Maersk &amp; IBM are using blockchain and no they wont have any token to aces it. Once they made it they will push gov's to accept this way of working and probably get others involved into it.  Thats why I since then stay away from any coin that targets that industry.


No any company thats taking itself serious isnt going to put an important part of its business into the hands of bitcoin development or bitcoin itself.
Maersk/IBM and whoever joins can build something that is quite simular but with the added benefit of having large wel known stable companies that know the industry and know what they are doing, working on it.
Take these as an example of standards that have multiple companies working together. Again this happens every day and wont be any different here. Maersk &amp; IBM will create a system using blockchain to ease the burden of paper work they will setup some independent entity that mantains/develops this and use their size/influence to make sure this is the adopted standard .
Again the only way to counter this, is to setup an own system thats already working and that companies can quickly implement and use . 
Bitcoin isnt that.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:48:28


You still dont get it that public blockchains arent the only way to use blockchain.
Plenty of ways for a company to create something simular witout the hassle of a "coin" and if they want they create a coin of their own that gets you discount at MS products.
I only see smaller companies or if some coin/token has a killer app ready to go that can be "given" to companies.  But then I look at coins like vechain, not bitcoin or any of the payment coins.


No they said they are looking into it, and why would the public burn theur tokens?

Only in a bull always going up market. Hodl is for those that want zero effort and little of no time. It is a higher risk btw. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:56:50


Yes, but thats not bitcoin and in a lot of cases the coin used is not needed. That company can just as easily implement it themsleves or the token used is more something added to benefit the creators not add an extra to the tech.


Now here you are dead wrong, companies wont use bitcoin as it simply doesnt have the possibilities. Its created as a payment system : a secure slow quite expensive decentralized payment system . I doubt it will be ever more then that for actual usage , the current role it has as intermediate between alts &amp; store of value is about as good as it can hope for.
You can easily see that as a lot of quite large companies have shown intrest in blockchain or have partnered up with some coins, yet none with bitcoin itself beyond some trials at payment systems that usualy didnt last long.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:28:27
Good for you, hope that never crashes down on you . 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:31:50


Its the miners thats important, you can easily move a node, miners are close to impossible to move.


No you don't, you still reason from a single user perspective, a company doesn't have this issue. A company can setup a hundred or a thousands nodes if needed. It can make agreements with others, hadnd it to some group,... Plenty of options that don't involve having a token to be able to pay someone else for doing the work.


You made agreements with others running nodes supporting them, taking care of security,... put that into contracts.
Again you reason from the perspective of a single user with limited options. Companies have plenty of options.


There is a need thats clear. Yet to me bitcoin is a very flawed way of filling in those needs. Thats why you don't see a lot of intrest in sidecoins on bitcoin. 


You still don't get that take for example Maersk, they don't care if you think its inferior.
Now they have a lot of paperwork because that needs to be checked, double checked along the routes its ships go. Converting that paperwork into some blockchain where Maersk, ports, countries are connected to would save everyone a whole lot of work and actually would make it safer for tampering/fraude.
They can easily spin this of into some group they have no control over taken care of  by different companies or interested parties.
You have to look beyond how bitcoin does it as the only way worth doing and see the possibilities.

People entering late or those who want to.maximize profits are better of swingtrading. 
Just inform yourself and look whats best for you. Holding isnt always the best option .
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:56:37


Then they didnt know what they were doing.


Only with swing trading. 1000% return from now (11k) means a million $ bitcoin. That would mean bitcoin would be valued more then the entire wealth of the earth .
Even 10 fold increase would mean bitcoin would be valued at the GDP of canada .


BTC its value what people are willing to pay for it, it has no intrinsic nor any company or support value . Simply put you believe that suddenly 10 times as much people se btc as 10 tems as valuable. (and thats tenfold increase)
Its never going to a real payments system that massivly adopted, at best niche and I see it as digital gold at a price below 30k .
Good luck for you too. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:48:21


I don't care one bit for Ethereum or any coin for that matter. 


And thats the way(well one of the ways) large corporations will go, thats all I am saying. 


Not going to happen how many mining pools/miners are there in china? How much of a % is that of the total miners? What country is going to put faith in that? 
And thats beyond the question why any country would actually do this and use such a volatile currency.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:16:48
Better hope that wont happen. Btc wont be of a lot of use if that does happen.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:58:32
Buying at 20k in december and then holding is imho not very smart. 
I know the holding is a bit of a dogma but past expierneces ...
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:06:36
That makes no sense. Why would maersk put its trust in bitcoin? Bitcoin cant even deliver what they need. 
But besides that why woukld a.large company put an.important part of its bussines into the hands of a few people sho have no clue what that company needs. 
To answer your question they would start some foundation of their own and join up with some tech company to get the knowledge. It happens every day such alliances and they are quite.normal to implement norms/rules/regulations .
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:26:54
You are simply not seeing the full picture. Companies (and then I talk about the large ones) dont care for a token, they dont care for decentral, nodes, market fluctuations. 
You can perfectly use blockchain without a token. Companies want control not be at the whim of the public.


Thats meaningless, its parnter for that is hyperledger, do look up how many coins they have out. 
Look at what MS wants to do ,even if you want you cant even use BTC for that, at best they accept it back as a payment option.
Yes blockchain will be used a lot even by big companies, but thats doesnt mean bitcoin and this article mixes those 2 together to give a false impression.

Thats simply word plays &amp; semantics to turn a normal speculative buy into something you can get a group behind.
I get why people doing it (group think and all that), but you are still buying bitcoin not to use it (as its use scenario for most people are close to non excisting) but because you think the value will go up. Thats speculating nothing more, you might once in a while actually buy something directly with BTC but thats not its main purpose .
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:28:52
How you can buy the dip if you dont sell? 
I advocate selling when coins are overbought and buying when they are oversold, not just holding them no matter what .
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:28:50
Where do you buy groceries directly with BTC?
How do you get your income directly in BTC?
Nice for you you got in early and got BTC "cheap" and can live of that now, but this is 2018 and not really an option (or even smart to do) . Also doesnt change that its still buying into a speculative coin to reap the profits later. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:48:11


You dont seem to understand that the market goes up and down? You seem to think its eithr always up or almost down.
If I think  coin is going downwards and I have that coin I would sell , not HOLD as you advocate (and hope it recovers) once I believe that coin will move up again I buy it again. 


It doesnt matter you dont sell at ATH, as long as the drop is bigger then where you sold. Or if it keeps dropping after you sell.


Tax rules are different in different countries and no, you get more as you advantage of the normal up and down of the market.


Its not I actually plenty of people I know made a lot more .


Thats simply not true (and certainly not "easy"), you stil seem to thnk BTC can go up with a 1000%? Not going to happen.


Taxes are not in your favour.
Dont really matter to me and a whole lot of people.


I dont assumt upwards trend for BTC for a long time anymore. Again it has reached a quite high ceiling I see a continuation of the trend since december so up &amp; down .
It also doesnt matter,  up or down a coin never does that in a straight line, its always up and down so even downwards trend you can make profits.


Again even if you want to stay in (plenty of reasons or that, brief exist can be quite profitable)


Yes you have to invest time, and this is where the problem lays I think.
Buying, holding &amp; hoping your  coin goes up is easy . Problem is that this is (for a coin like BTC) basicly a gamble if you do this blindly. 
And if you have a small investment now holding and hoping your coin goes *1000 is quite naive. 
It also doesnt matter you can make more and basicly keep holding your coin. 
The difference is someone that is holding blindly isnt actually investing he's gambling. Someone that informs himself and trades depending on information is investing.
Be carefull what might have worked the previous years wont necessarily work the next ones. Its better to inform yourself and 
 decide what to do based on that (be it hold or trade) .
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:17:42
Sure it what people that dont HOLD do.
and yes past experiences, market changes what worked before wont always work now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:40:52
Well the nodes for bitcoin still we be mostly in china not in hands of Maersk or the "standards group", development of bitcoin the same,...
Oh yes they have control of the side chain but again no large company is goin to put his faith in such a setup with pow and all the issues it contains. 


Contracts/law they are called, its wat companies use for a very long time to make sure different parts stick to a deal. 
Look bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency and it was very well in that. All the patchwork and added extra to try and transform it into something else are just that: trying to turn bitcoin into something it wasn't really designed. Now this isn't really an issue for a regular user or even a small company they have little choice in the mater. Yet a large company does and it simply makes no sense to go that way when they can cheaper/easier/stabler/more controlled/... create this themselves or in a group.
Again the only exception I see is with an actually established working product that can be easily integrated . Again bitcoin doesn't have this.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:52:17
The question is when to sell. In a downward market you sell wait for the sell.presure to ease off and buy lower. You get more coins then when.you hold.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:44:57
Again, to correct myself: what country is going to put its money/wealth into a crypto coin that for the vast mayorty calculated  in china? BTC is still vulnerable for 51% takeover .


Let me reply as simple as I can make it, a company can work with others and form a group, a group that implements a trusted system using blockchain thats cheaper, more reliable and more trustworthy then current systems.
Thinking bitcoin is the one and only "real" case there is is just deying the tech.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:41:01
You are an exception for most people this simply isnt possible nor do i think people actually want it. From a secure investment pov putting all your money in 1 thing isnt smart. 
You seem to be ideology driven? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:16:04
Yeah that was wrong, rest isnt. 
BTC 100k isnt going to happen any time soon. For any 10 fold increase in large coins you need swing trades or go to the "smaller" alt coins and thats far fom easy .
10fold increase in BTC value still is a lot more then the GDP of canada thats a lot of newmoney that has to flow into crypto's and then just BTC.
With the same BTC dominance the total market cap would be 5 trillion or the GDP of japan or getting close to all the gold ever mined.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:02:33


Seeing how long it took to sort out something simple as segwit/LN to be able to do what it was setout to do , no company in his right mind would hope that this can be achieved any time soon or as they want.
After all this would be completely in the control of the bitcoin development team. 


Funny how you dont see that if they wait for bitcoin to develop something simular they will be just as good point of failure.
Thats why again: no company that has any size will take these risks with an important part of its company. They will either develop themselves /have some group do it so they can keep control/accountability while on at the same time implement the advantages they get from using bitcoin.
The only real inroad for any token is a developed and ready product thats being used and has proven itself. There I can see larger companies implement this. Again beyond payments bitcoin isnt that.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:21:00
Well a currency like the dollar or euro is supported by the economies where its used and the countries that nought it. Meaning for dollar and euro quite stable. Stock/bonds/real estate/... all have some underlying value.
Bitcoin still has none of that and i doubt it will ever get that. 
Not that it matters to.me as an.investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:19:51
Funny to see how partisan people get. Even for a virtual coin.
No not an ethereal fanboy, just an example.


You would also need that same country sized amount of energy to run any large network. 
Again for any large private company/group this makes no sense. Plenty of better ways to implement blockchain, have immutable data trough consensus and use the normal business models they have in place to govern all this.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:40:37


BUt you do realise bitcoin is just a payment system? That what you want/companies need isnt even possible with bitcoin?  It would need massive development to take it away from being just a payment system to something else.
Development that took years before they were even able to handle the small amount of transactions they process now for any low cost/high speed it was setup to be.


No maersk CAN inroduce a distributed trustless ledger without ever getting close to bitcoin or using it if it wants thats what you fail to understand. 
And even if they wanted to implement some already excisting coin, even then bitcoin isnt what they want as bitcoin simply isnt suited for what they want.
They would look at  for example. Runs on Ethereum . 
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:28:05
Wel it gives you financial sovereignty if you invest into it, and I doubt you would do that if it would have an 1 to 1 relation to the dollar like USDT. 
As do I you use it mainly as an investment platform to make money. Therefor its better to be informed and act as the market does and not just HOLD and hope you end up with profits.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:08:21
Thats easy to say when you are very much in.profits. not eveyone has that. And YOU stilltake bigger risks by.not following the market.

@_date: 2018-02-20 23:43:59
How do you get rekt then? At worst you loose out on some profit but in most cases you make that up.
Take now I sold at 11715 and will enter again at under 105xx
Yes its possible it will shoot up again then I might buy at below 115xx whatever the outcome I have more profit then just holding.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:25:50
You still forget that this is in a controlled setup. Bitcoin needs to be what it is because of the zero trust/decentralized setup. You need both proof who you are/what you have and that he transfer will be correct.
A private blockchain setup doesn't need to do this, you can have a consensus module with an open decentralized public ledger .


Maersk is a fine example. Say a ship moves trough ports, how will you make sure; The cloud based DB isn hacked, the ship is who it says it is, it has the paperwork it claims to have,...
Store all this data in a blockchain controlled by customs/countries/shipping companies/... that run the nodes and you get a faster, smoother cheaper and better traceable shipping.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:57:09


Yeah problem is you can never know when a market will keep trending upwards on the contrary even, plenty of people stated the december increase wasnt sustainable and made a lot of money getting out, and going back in later when it crashed . ANyone holding at that time either lost money (some still have losses) or saw his profits diminished.


I missed only 1/3 of the time the past year. I have quite detailed graph/stats one of them is just holding on whatever I started with. (I actually was on the fence the first time, same logic like you so I wanted a comparison point) With not holding I currently am around 120% better of then with holding. 
I only started mid last year so its possible ebfore it was different.


Its not if the market is heavily overbought, or there is FUD or there is run or upcoming annoucment on a coin its always got to either sell and buy back at a lower price point or switch coin to get the FOMO moment there.
LTC for example, got +30% LSK +25% ETC +35% (you will see I tend to sell too quick and could have made even more profit but thats still what I need to improve) I still am in Zcoin, VEN &amp; back into LSK (after the drop) If I would have stayed in BTC or any one or two coins I would have had a lot less profits and even losses as BTC is still lower as where I entered those coins. I did pick up BTC unfortunatly not at its lowest (7k) so made a nice profit selling it just under 11k, went back in at 10k waiting for it get to 12k now. Again 50% profit there and some I know made close to a 80%.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:45:45
