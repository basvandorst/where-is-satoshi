You can message support for an increase.  If your credit is stellar they will increase it to $5000.  You probably are only $100 because you have poor or no credit.  Would you say that is true?

Oh please provide a citation for more reading.  I would love to understand why all my penny stocks flattened after a bubble and instead keep falling towards 0

interest rates are negative now?
also, i have a real question for you.  do you want to see what happens when our government doesn't do enough (such as not lower interest rates)?

Of course you don't own the dollars, the dollars are owned by the fed *since we gave them authority to manage the money supply*.  I know 100 years is a lot of time for people in this sub, but there was a time when you could write down "IOU 1 silver shiling" and give it to your bartender.  Then that bartender could give your IOU to a chicken farmer.  Then the chicken farmer could come back to you asking for the silver.  *that is what the IOU stands for*, **the fed will stand behind the IOU of the value to whoever is holding that paper dollar**.  Why is this such a difficult concept when you use it everyday??
   Ask yourself this, who owns Bitcoin if the blockchain were to disappear?  Who owns Bitcoin if you started your own blockchain, gave away those bitcoins, and then made your blockchain disappear?
