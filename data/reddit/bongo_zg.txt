holding means that you have entered at the wrong time, and have to bear the consequences of such (wrongful) decision. I am not claiming I am entering at the right time, but I found stop loss orders to be valuable during a bear market

This looks like a sumo fight between bulls and bears..
Good strong support, but no bounce unfortunatelly
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:41:11
I think we would need a good reason to go (significantly) up at this moment.. 
I see dead buyers
Sad thing is that today's fundamentals are much better than 6 months ago. Now we have regulation, KYC, AML, no MtGox, ETFs are somewhere in a pipeline, etc.. 
but the market does need to honor it immediatelly.. and while saying this, hard to make such statement while knowing that btc as a commodity does not have any fundamentals..(price is determined exlusively by the market)
Edit 2:
I see on a few occasions that price level of 6050 was defended. Each time sellers/shorters tried to dump the price, it was quickly reverted.
I think (please correct me) that such strong defence is a good sign
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:59:56


I wouldn't bet. There are numerous of projects in a pipeline at the moment, from ETFs that are awaiting for regulation, to LN, etc.. so, 3 years is too long for that. I would say until the late 2018 the market would stay sluggish

I have a hyphotesis I would like you to confirm or deny:
I watched documentaries regarding 1929. Market crash, and it all seemed to be similar to this market.
I assumed that governments wanted to cool down the market to regulate it and to prevent villans like North Korea of using cryptocurrencies from avoiding sanctions... the way to cool down was through media, CME/CBOE futures, MtGox sellof, etc..
Now, after KYC and AML is in place, they can start allowing market to grow..
And oh yeah.. I didn't mention that most likely big players had their own interest in buying coins on sale, or making money by shorting the market.. 
Please comment

Is there any limit to how much you can spend? (I am in Europe)
Is it widely adopted?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:03:13
You have to define what it means when things go up.. I think when prices go up for 1%, people get lamborection
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:38:30
I think Clif High also predicted btc at 50k by some time this year.. right?
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:36:36
Well, ETFs are investments into the cryptocurrencies, not into the tech, and LN is an example of usage/application of btc
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:47:10
I'm more than glad to see an experienced WS analyst here.. 
most of cryptocurrencies market is a retail market loaded with emotions, not knowledge..
So, what's your opinion on what is probable to happen in a next 6 months?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:01:05
Where did you buy using LN?
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:18:51
I agree, and annual “proof of keys” event helps legitimacy and serves as a kind of annual audit on the exchanges. 
But, as I am watching on the price regularly, I couldn’t avoid to notice that price of btc goes down before the expiry date of CME btc monthly futures. 
I am oblivious how such “cash settled btc” (paper btc) could actually affect the price. Based on my past accounting experience, I have some loopholes in understading it.. 
so, as I presumed that the price is being manipulated to some extent, I wanted to get some more info on those new ways of manipulation..
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:25:55
I got excited too, as I am hoping to end this bear market, not to get me wrong
@_date: 2019-10-09 09:04:46
I doubt SEC will approve ETF, and yes, therefore BTC will suffer from another beating
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:14:38
Not upset, but I see it as childish/immature to pick up on the news from the selected sites, based on a personal preference.. regardless the fact that this news (and the link) has not anything with btc vs bch vs bsv... topic
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:56:34
It’s called market spoofing, and considered illegal in regular markets. 
I’ve seen it many times... yes, from my perspective, market is heavily being manipulated.. 
having such 24/7 unregulated market with various assets/coins is like inviting cannibals for a dinner at your place.
@_date: 2019-10-09 09:02:51
My 2 cents:
The next financial crisis will start in China. 
I will be fueled/triggered by the Middle East tensions, that would propell the price of oil.
The economic downturn will be futher fueled by Trump’s trade war
It will all fall on Deutsche Bank, which is 3 times bigger than Lehman Brothers, and it will crash EU economy. 
How EU will politically survive after that? No one knows
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:56:21
I had to double check the date, as the opinion seems like more from a year ago
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:01:35
You can easily guess
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:05:46
This is my opinion, when trying to understand from the accounting point of view. 
If you can outgun another traders on the market to manipulate the price, then you are a winner.. 
but, with growing acceptance, liquidity, etc.. it would become costly, and therefore questionable.
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:20:47
I agree with this, that it states a fraud

be aware that such drop is 'healthy for the market' :p
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:06:49
I've read some of those rejections, and if I were a prospective ETF manager, I would really rethink my strategy. Past rejections had serious objections, and by simply applying over and over again with a minor changes won't make it through. 
CBOE might pass, as I would assume their application will be more serious, and SEC will ease ETF rules by then
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:54:06
Just don't tell you'll eat your intimate parts if it doesn't happen

You want to say that even CBOE ETF will share the same fate?
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:01:09
Because I would assume that Winklewoss brothers and others do not have experience starting or running ETF, and CBOE is not just well experiences, but most likely well connected.

Today I stumbled upon this article:
Title is: UPS patent file describes system that could decentralize private sales
To me, it looked very much alike Lightning network.
Please note that this might be a patent trolling on a product that is very close to its public release.
I am from EU, and according to EU patent law, you can file a complain regarding such patent files if you find it as an ‘existing technology’.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:51:28
beg to disagree. 
The advantage of a bitcoin as a non-inflationary asset is that it would keep the price (and increase) over the long term compared to regular currencies. As long as regular prices are in USD, EUR, etc, the person who owns bitcoin has an advantage. 
Having said that, companies cannot retain bitcoin on their account, as it is not medium of exchange, but just an intermediatery asset class. they cannot financially keep records about btc, and accountants would have a headache about it. so, to have something like that, we would need an international accounting standards to clarify what bitcoin is, how to keep in in the books, etc. Only then, then real crypto bookkeeping could start

Why this drop in the hashrate?

They are fined for that, and libor will be discontinued because of that..
But, there was a strict regulation and due process that brought them to paying fines.

I have never voted for this kind of market. Unregulated market means swimming with sharks, dealing with people who could outsmart (manipulate) or outgun the market.

if that's true, I am so happy that he burned almost 100 mil. usd in a last 2 days trying to manipulate the market..

Which is not a valid argument.. it is called argumentum ad populom.

ok, I am looking at situation on Bitfinex, but similar happens on another exchanges AFAIK. Huge sell orders... a moment ago they were removed, and the price spiked up...
a moments after that, a new sell order have been placed (800-1200 BTCs). 
As this is happening on another exchanges, to me it looks like bots programmed at the same way. Who would have such amount of BTCs and such intentions to drop the market?

but, if he is shorting, he would need to 'borrow' BTCs that he would return later, and he would need to push the price down... am I right? meaning, he would need to spend certain amount on pushing the price down

I voted with Euros, and in the EU, we are protected by regulators.
I do understand that you value your freedom (of being unregulated/unprotected) more than your wallet, but that's you (or, you Americans).
Your IRA tax authority will come to collect taxes from you, but you would still not ask for a protection from SEC/CFTC
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:29:30










ok, got it.. but, for example, he/someone sold 3k BTCs 2 hours ago, and there wasn't enough volume until now to buy back the same amount of BTCs.. what then? (and the price almost came back to the previous level)

Market manipulation like these are casting a dark shadow over cryptocurrencies market. I saw yesterday on Bitfinex some market spoofing around 6 p.m. UTC time.. 
why I am saying this? Because first of all, bitcoin came as a result on market manipulation, corrupt banking system and widespread injustice on financial market back in 2008.
Recently, it was often heard that cryptocurrencies markets do not need a regulation, and it was raising a red flag to me. Because it is like saying we do not need cops.. well, guess who will come then, and who would rule? Yes, gangs and criminals.
Well, with such liquid market and possible high gains, it was a call to those kinds of people.. and cryptocurrency society didn't do anything to regulate itself, but instead of that, YT is full of videos tagged with   etc..
I personally think this is a last call to regulate things properly, or hand over those markets to various sharks and people like Soros, Rotschild, Rockefeller and others. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:23:31
why they would do this? paying taxes? or something we do not know regarding regulation?
one of my conspiracy theories: some korean exchanges (Bithumb, etc) have received some AML letter from authorities, meaning some persons on sanction list or any form of illegal sources of money were used to trade cryptocurrencies. it might mean they are offloading their wallets
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:40:15
ok... how would you recognize such a 'serial killer' is on the move? I am saying because right now, the price started to recover..
also, what if there is some larger investor buying the sell? he could run out of steam at one moment (Soros)
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:47:22
Your taxes and utility bills are still being payed in fiat currencies.. USD is a legal tender, while BTC is not..
Therefore, in a real life outside of cryptocurrency market, fiat currency is a real money.
Which means, once you would need to cash out your bitcoin and pay for the gas, it will be a substantial difference if 1 btc would worth 1000 usd or 10.000 usd
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:04:46
Bitfinex - yesterday 12k btc, a moment ago 3k.
100 mil. usd to drop the price? doesn't look like just a whale
