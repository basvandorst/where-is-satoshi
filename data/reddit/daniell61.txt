felt good to make a few bucks and get back in :D
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:02:16
Im heavily debating selling as I to think itll dip/crash. And eventually come back up. Everytime ive been wrong. 
Since 12K :|
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:57:31
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:20:04
Im still above lol.  
Barely. :|
@_date: 2014-05-22 04:41:40
Ive used BTC to pay for stuff at times(ive long since quit mining.... shits expensive yo')
plus BTC is nice and awesome! plus it raises the awareness for our counterparts....
^TO ^^THE ^^^MOOO^^^^NN
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:10:27
i would do this if i had a iphone....also will it blend?
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:22:16
oh i realise value means nothing if it dips.
im planning on investing a bit soon :)
while its low.
and as they say buy low sell high!
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:57:05
Then why you in this thread?
Much hate. Such Feels.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:01:39
well this is shitty. just tried to mine btc again... im getting 24.5 mega hash per second....yet with dogecoin i get 74 kh/s -_-
or gpu and cpu combined for 28 Mhps
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:09:05
bitcoins =/= a few dollars.

@_date: 2014-03-17 17:52:31
and no problem dude :P
did you know the first guy ever to comment on reddit said "Reddit is going downhill lately"
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:48:31
Good god...
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:51:08
i gotta ask. using bitminters miner im getting 0.00000071 per block yet ive mined/completed 260 proofs of work...
my gpu is lower end(geforce 640 gs) but its out putting ~26 Mh/s(Igpu is 4.5Mh/s)
im assuming at this point its worthless for me to mine?(so close to getting enough coins to sell em)
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:17:26
possibly. all i know is im getting lots of coins easier cause all the new guys are falling off.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:49:32
Good god its tipping suicide :O
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:56:47
wow wowwowowoowowow
litecoin and doge are merging? Why the fuck did i not hear about this?!
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:23:47
this isnt twitter...
is how you do it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:05:27
Erm. whats going on with china?
all i know is dogecoins value just shot off into nothing virtually :(
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:01:44
hmmmm... i have a partial bitcoin..wonder what the exchange rate would be
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:50:28

**THIS IS A TEMPORARY STOP. OP STOP FAILING IN TYPING TITLES**
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:09:47
no. i just figured doge coin wouldnt flat line to 0.000020
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:10:12
We just forked and lost a shit load of return.
i doubt anyone would want to fork again just for a bit of security...hell we just lost like 200% of our value overnight....
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:37:15
Very true, very coin, so wall, so amaze, so accurate!
E: im sorry :(
i tried and failed horribly!
@_date: 2014-04-25 19:45:27
you accept doge...NICE
dude you should accept Fedoarcoins/TiPS also!!! it would help us and you!
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:41:00
&lt;is right here. :D
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:51:31
yeah im a doge miner...not bitcoin miner xDthough my wallet still says i only got 200...weird
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:20:54
.....its another cryptocurrency....bet if doge was worth more you would be on our car.
The world needs other currencies to balance out.
if everything was USD it wouldnt be balanced but i dont know if that makes sense since im so tired ATM
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:34:29
Meanwhile I lost all my fucking bitcoins due to head crashes...Who knew backups could corrupt when you follow the rule of four backups a piece...
$350 at the time was lost. The feels...Took me months to make that.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:32:24
Oh good. would a merge be worth it? doesnt look like it ot me.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:32:49
satoshi? ive been hearing bad things about them for US people...
and ive been using the coin mill.
$1 = 2357 coins or so
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:21:37
where do you go to buy?
i should hoard/stock pile doge before it shoots up...
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:13:00
I leave for a month. and come back. and shits up $1200? fuck yeah.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:26:57

a couple internet users? nope it's not *that* bad aka korea.
yes the internet is slow as all fuck balls (dial up is fast...) and most don't have it but its like.....5 computers per small town I think?
@_date: 2015-07-22 03:14:08
Cuban here as well (or child of one if you want to be specific)
I would *love* for this to work. but knowing castro/the brother this WILL get fucked over somehow.
I just know it.
And it fucking depresses me.
@_date: 2015-07-22 03:10:34
I love bitcoin like all hell (and doge) but as a cuban I feel no. I KNOW castro/brother are somehow going to fuck this up. They just will.
Its in their nature to take control and fuck stuff over. And the people.
If any of my cousins are reading this I apologize but it's most likely true. (*I hope im wrong but I sincerely doubt it.....* **FUCK CASTRO** )

It wasn't illegal or anything. Cuba just got briber or some shit...

too lazy to research but that makes sense.
E: wonder if my amatuerass self could hijack the wifi there.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:10:08
Me every fucking week :|
I've basically said fuck it and everytime I get paid I skip lunch and drop that $5-15 into btc
@_date: 2015-07-22 03:20:08
TLDR: cuba's broke as shit and has almost zero money and they want money.
They = castro.
@_date: 2015-07-22 03:12:06
America can't tell Cuba to do shit. (E: obligatory obama's shitty and wont say shit anyway)
Castro wouldn't listen anyway. (cant remember brothers name)
Becides the companies have a monopoly so why the fuck would they let it go?
And My parents are full blooded cuban. Cuban telco's can't send more than ~4 low res pictures at a time within reason and without over loading the network.

My main hard drive had a headcrash....And all ~5 backups I had got corrupted....I got lucky -_- Lost my wallet. Lost my miner. at least I managed to recover something like 0.003 of a coin.....
tldr: headcrash. and all online backups failed.
who knew.
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:13:50
What utter cunt bags.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:29:34

@_date: 2017-05-25 15:16:20
and im over here.
wishing I had put more than a couple bucks into it way back in the day
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:05:47
Shit I got into mining in 2012 made a few coins and then they got stolen from me :(
Damn syncable wallets.....
As well as the whole mining thing managed to zap my first two gpu's. :(
grats on making something off coins. I went negative lmfao.
same with doge.....Got into it then my wallet got broken into. (didn't even know it was a thing. now I've lost most of my coins :C )
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:14:46
I took a professional class and secured everything.
Either way lost cause since all my bitcoins are gone.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:12:41
Yay :D
I finally found what im going to save my bitcoins up for(even though i only have 20 dollars in bitcoins) what would your price be? and what wallet should i use for bitcoins? currently i use bitminter as a miner
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:10:40
Im just starting to do bitcoin mining and i love to do geochacing on spair time :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:11:10
As i unrelated sidenote.....anyone know where i can find a pool/server for litecoin? my hardware is to shitty to mine solo :(
@_date: 2013-08-01 21:30:08
Can i ask where the restuarant is?(and do you accept regular cash?) im in florida to :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:53:13

im buying a better gpu to rake more in...or usb miners...
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:58:18
As would a lot of people :)
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:47:02
Three weeks of mining for a *penny*? Fuck i need a new rig...
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:50:53
anyone know what the fuck you do with a namecoin?(i almost have a complete namecoin from bitminter)
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:19:33
Damn it...now i have to let it catch up the 20 million blocks..FML
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:09:17
Damn it. well that anwsers my question..thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:24:58
I keep getting miner failed to start. make sure the minerd executable and libraries in the same directroy as litecoin qt.. im confused D:
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:10:18
Im jealous :(
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:48:42
Havent seen them for 70 either..(ebay?) only for 100.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:51:00
how much are miners? im kinda broke and cant spend much :(
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:44:42
TIL.(now i need a damn coin wallet and windows so i can start mining again...)
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:18:05
Cool i can store my .0005 of a bitcoin xD
@_date: 2013-08-09 00:00:00
Well my cpu is mining using two cores only..so that may account for the low hash rate currently..and frankly its not putting too much stress on my pc and i have plans to overhaul the whole damn system.(not even a year old and i have plans for a new pc..i love my job :D )
And its a I3 3220 at 3.3GHz stock. so could that be it?(im running windows 7 ultimate on 4GB of corsair gaming ram aka vengeance blue.)
E: fuck. yes. five blocks  in 60 minutes. so much win.(gpu only cpu only has one blcok)
Double edit: did i forget to mention im downloading shit loads of games AND im on reddit, reading, gaming on xbl, and listing to music while mining?...
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:52:50
very little... i currently have a quarter of a coin :l 0.00010615 not too much but for running my laptop now and then and my desktop 24/7 thats pretty good for cpu crunching..
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:03:25
meanwhile im trying to decide a graphics card to add to my rig so that i can mine better...
@_date: 2013-05-29 05:02:41
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:22:32
Nice, though i think im going to wait as im building my rig and waiting for the parts to get here :)
im planning on SLI'ing two EVGA Geforce 8400 GS(1GB GDDR5) graphics cards, one: they are cheap, two: i got one for free off a friend..
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:55:05
I get more then that in a day &gt;:D
curently though i only have 0.00010615 two days of mining with a intel xeon dual core,(2.4GHz) and a intel core I3 (2.2 GHz) no gpu mining..and sometimes a intel centrino duo at 1.6GHz sooo yeah shitty laptop but im still making profit :)
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:57:07
centrino duo, then what the heck is my cpu in the dell inspiron 6400???
i doubt its the intel GMA 945 as thats the graphics chipset.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:44:05
Sweet. wait minecraft INSIDE minecraft???????!!?!?!?!
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:13:37


Uhh thats kinda a d'oh :P though you make a profit so congrats :P though got any pro tips graphics card wise(under a hundred dollars) for graphics mining?
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:28:12
Reading this im thinking "i could have gotten into this with my friends if we knew about this two years ago.." oh well im cranking my laptop to crunching coins again..(200Khps is decent for a I3 dual core no threading and no gpu in a laptop i like to think)
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:32:33
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:13:16
I apologize for the lack of screen crop and color... i have MS paint and its the one you get from online and it only saves in .PNG or dmp(dip?) and it almost always loses color...so i apologize
also bitcoin is worth $584.77 USD
@_date: 2013-05-29 04:34:32
How much are the miners currently? the usb ones at least, im thinking about looking for one till my gaming rig gets here(planning on using my gaming rig as a gaming rig and mining rig :D since i have shitloads of extra parts :P
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:49:06
Awww i want a rig :( then i looked at the prices...
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:54:37
wait. .0003 of a bitcoin is worth ten dollars? huh
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:11:18
care to explain how?
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:52:11
Veverything i use is bitminter :P (
And if the I3 only has 2 cores why does task manager show four? .-.
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:25:56
Yep :) when i used litecoin(for the two days i got it to work) i pulled about 50-100 income on a block but with desktop and laptop(using bitminter) i pull 200-250 :D
Bitminter also has LOTS of people who use them so they make profit which is why they are so cheap :)
And do you have any idea what the hell namecoins do? i have 0.00085090 of a namecoin ._.
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:08:57
Where the fuck are the 10 dollar miners...ive never seen them for tne..only 100+
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:56:03
Cause im not a thief and she would notice if i tried xD
plus we pay something like 50 bucks for power ._.

Hey im sorry :(
bitcoin to cash is confusing...
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:15:51
thanks for teh tip...guess ill go to litecoin and hope for the best.
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:52:08
They are? TIL
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:58:02
Well i WAS joking..
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:09:04
Two ish weeks..and thats mainly my desktop with integrate graphics(ATI ES800) on my intel server board s3000AH.. i think you're mixing up Khps and Mhps ._. M is bigger K is smaller(M= better K= average) on my laptop i get 200Khps(killa hash per second i think) i use bitminter.com as my site(they have the smallest fee of 1% to use ) and they have a miner you can use :) frankly considering i have a quarter of a bitcoin($25 ATM) its not much but if you get 1.4 bitcoins thats a cheaper bitcoin miner you can buy off the bitcoinstore.com
on a day i usually get about 200-250 so by tomorrow i should have almost a bitcoin(my laptop rarely mines bitcoins as i have to use it for school..)
GPU mining is the best and im not expert on that so cant help with it(sorry) um anything else i can try to explain to you? (i can give you links to good miner pools and websites to use :)
@_date: 2013-07-21 01:49:00

@_date: 2013-05-29 05:33:27
Shit. all i want is a damn miner that aint 500 bucks..
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:54:15
Yep i know but my laptop and desktop are on 24/7 so if i make 10 bucks its nice :P
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:01:48
As someone who stopped mining for various reasons....i hope this kid is able to help those in need....he is doing good work :)
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:12:30
._. yes i get free power(live with parents as im 15) and i have no dedicated gpu :l and ive tried litecoin but cant get it to work properly with me..so im just going to say fuck it till i build my new gaming rig and turn that into a miner when im not gaming
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:13:34
as someone who mines coins now and then...thank you :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:40:19
i was using bitminter client as that was the first thing i found but now im using litecoin as its for pools(my graphics card just died yesterday) and thanks :)
@_date: 2013-08-02 13:35:35
TIL but im not homeless :P
And that is were i would send my bitcoin..IF I HAD ONE.(seriously im half way to a bitcoin damn it..)

@_date: 2013-05-07 15:24:42
Yeah i am building a rig though soo, and yes i told both my parents im mining and if the electric bill gets to high just let me know and ill cut the mining down a lot.(i play my xbox a ton so doubt the notice a difference :P )

bitcoin qt? i use the normal one that is bitcoin qt but it wont fucking sync to the network..it keeps saying its done and saying the last block was made 3 hours ago..i let it run for two weeks and it kept saying that..
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:54:56
True, but SLI should get them to work decently if not bench decent stats on some games(i get what i can afford then i upgrade later)
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:38:04
Also everything on my pc(custom build) is standard clock. no overclocking has been done in any way.(save the gpu which was brought from 520MHz to 540.)
@_date: 2013-08-05 01:05:57
Ok seriously what is TOR?(torrent?) and yeah bitcoin and crypto currencies set to crash as feds cant control it.
If THEY cant CONTROL something how do they DESTROY it :P
