I also got this spam email, and more alarmingly the one below that got.

Or they just realized a vulnerability that they are hesitant to release for many reasons: could still affect them, others, etc. IMHO, working in small companies it still takes time to process and truly figure out what happened. But your possibility is still a possibility. I'm just reminded of Occam's razor.

I disagree. There could be lots of reasons. In general all that it proves is that rolling your own security is hard. What they are doing is offloading most of their security to a Amazon, who has likely one of the most cutting edge security teams in the world. They are effectively reducing the attack vector that their security team has to worry about (not just physical).

The source he mentions in the arbitrage scheme merely had suspicions -- no proof. We're no further in our understanding.

Funny this article is linked here... Why don't you just go read the AMA yourself? I know I don't need someone else to add their own layer of opinion onto what was said.

Can anyone tell me WTF is up with the new site? They blame problems on all the new users, but their new site is terrible! I've developed trust and appreciation using them over the past 6 months -- never a problem, quick trades -- but since the new site spawned I even hesitate to send BTC their way. Definitely wouldn't recommend them to new users at the moment.

I like the reminders that pop up throughout. Am I too l late?
