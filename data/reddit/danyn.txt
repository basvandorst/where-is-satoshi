Harsh got deported back to India for calling the police on his coke dealer (he moved in with them at their drug house) and saying that they tortured him or some shit. Apparently they gave him sugar instead of coke.. I'm not too sure what happened since he was a compulsive liar but yeah lol. Happened a couple years ago at my uni res.

Holy fuck. Not really related but I knew a guy named Harsh. His sister was Harshita. Never thought I'd see the name again.

I think you'd have better luck begging on the streets

Unlike Thanksgiving, Christmas occurs at the same time worldwide. Families and friends will be celebrating Xmas and New Years. The parties will allow people to talk about Bitcoin. It's all speculation of course.

Couldn't you also argue that Christmas will bring Bitcoin more exposure and as a result, increase the price even more?

100% this. A few years ago, I had a friend message me asking where to plug the USB drive I gave her. It took almost 30 minutes of back and forth before she finally understood what was going on.
I could not fathom how she made it to 12th grade without knowing where the USB port on her laptop was. Just thinking about it makes me sad.

There is the verification process. I feel like a bitcoin game exchange could help train the newbies. You spin a roulette each day to get fake money and you can buy fake btc with that money. Fake btc can follow real btc so you get a feel for what's going on.

Yea. That said, he wasn't smoking a cigar. It was weed + tobacco.

First discovered bitcoin when it was around $30. My young ass could barely even afford a ps3 game back then so no way was I spending money on bitcoins.
Told my family about it and they were like, "yeah we'll give you some money to invest, why not?!"
Too bad they never pulled through. Now that blame me for not pushing them -,-
Although we would've probably sold as soon as it hit 100 or something. Oh well.

Wouldn't you end up with less bitcoins if the price were to slowly rise during those 20 months? I agree with what you're saying and it's probably safer since if there's a huge drop you'll still have money on hand.

I heard that gemini is better? Haven't done any research. Just what I've read
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:13:13
The way I see it, the more news I spread for Bitcoin, the more potential buyers. Hopefully it'll help pave the road to $10k.

Gotta get btc and karma at the same time

So Coinbase allows you to buy from their stock whereas GDAX allows you to trade with other people?

What websites or apps do I need to get this going and start watching 1 min charts? Haven't invested anything but this sounds right up my alley.

How does validating work? New to everything.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:48:43
I was looking into gemini (I think that's what it was called)
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:21:48
I first discovered them when they were $15. Still haven't purchased any but I plan on buying some soon. While I regret not buying, I'm certain that I would've sold them soon after.
