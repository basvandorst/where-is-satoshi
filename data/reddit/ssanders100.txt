$1500 is a mortgage payment and a couple months of daycare which is a new expense now that I'm reentering the workforce.  I know its going to be hard but I have to do this. Thanks for your help so far!

That worked!  I was able to input the password and get in but my computer still wont open the drive. I'll get the app you mentioned and will follow back up.

From what I can tell Segwit was empty.  The top right corner of the app said BTC 0.  I restarted the app and chose Legacy but the amount listed doesnt make any sense to me.  It says he has .1334176?  Is it possible to have less than 1 bitcoin?

This is pretty much what Ive taken away from everyones comments so far.  Ive received quite a few private messages and some of them are offering to help privately but I feel safer following advice thats given to me in public where others can fact check.

Thank you. I put it back in our safe to keep it secure.

This has been a nightmare for me to try and figure out on my own.  If my husband hadnt written "bitcoin" on the ziplock bag this thumbdrive was in I probably would have thrown it out after not being able to browse what was on it.
Please make sure you leave your loved ones proper instructions.  Bitcoins are very confusing but everyone in this thread is being very helpful.
