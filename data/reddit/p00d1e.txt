Government has the ability to steal money from its citizens and slaves long before they create fiat money and banking. Tax collectors knocking your door and take what they need, your food, your goats and cows, your gold and silver - if you have this. And they torture you if you resist or even show him that you unhappy with tax collector visit. Ability to take money not rely on money traceability, but on force and gunpower.

I don't need "to be allowed" make decision how robbers use my money. I pay only for things I need, not you or government. If you can't live without robbing others, why do I care about your needs?

State has the most military might and each person is subject to the state. Refuse to pay your taxes and tell us about your freedom and safety with state. 
Yes, you need gun and might to be free and sovereign person, even U.S Founding Fathers told something about it.

"If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear", why you wanna snitch from the shadow, dude? You love laws and government, but not giving your name to your beloved police, what's wrong with you? You don't trust your officials? They not put you in jail for snitching, you must be proud of yourself as crime fighter. Even Judas Iscariot snitch to the Sanhedrin for  thirty silver coins and not hiding his name, why you hide your?
