Horrible thing to say.
If they are dangerous it's because they were raised by people who are dangerous. I REALLY hope your children won't grow up to be bad...:)

as written in the website, these dogs are in special need as the government decided, with no grounds, that this is a dangerous breed that should not be adopted. This is why a lot more of these dogs are taken into illegal fight circles and families abandon them. Yuval takes them in and makes a better life for them, on the expense of his own.
Thank you for your feedback though.

When you say encrypted wallet - do you mean the option to encrypt it inside the wallet-program, or archiving the .dat file in a password safe RAR\ZIP file?
