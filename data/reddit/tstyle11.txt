This article does a great job laying out the high level pros and cons of decentralized exchanges. As the founder of a decentralized exchange called DDEX, I spend a lot of time thinking about "why aren't more people using dexs?". Here are some additional information on the key challenges mentioned in the article:
**Usability - A dex can only control part of the user experience:**
As the article and many comments point out, the average decentralized exchange is hard to use. Some of it is just poor UI/UX design, but another reason is that decentralized exchanges rely on third party wallets such as MetaMask, Trust, or Brave. Have you ever tried to complete a transaction on MetaMask and see a scary screen full of gibberish? (This is not a knock on the MetaMask team or the other open source teams that are creating a ton of value for the ecosystem, but it's still early, and there's lots of room for improvements)
**Liquidity - Harder for market makers:**
One important but rarely discussed reason for liquidity issues is that it takes more effort for market makers to integrate their program to work on decentralized exchanges. For example, it requires a slow, expensive on-chain transaction to cancel orders for older decentralized exchanges. This may not be a deal-breaker for the average trader, but is a huge problem for the market making algorithms.
For every person who can wield a ledger, there's 100 users who feel imitated by the thought of managing their own private keys. MakerDao and Basecoin may be more  decentralized than the notorious Tether, but its a lot easier to explain to new comers that 1 USDT is 1 USD. 
The easy and popular answer is "liquidity and usability, duh...", but there's no fundamental law of the universe that says it has to be so. We are working hard to solve of these problems. [Try us out]( I'd love to hear what you think, and would be happy to answer any questions on all things related to decentralized exchanges!

The total cryptocurrency marketcap of 117.5B is also a historic high!

I misread the title and thought it was a new algorithm called "Proof of Wife"

I'd love to see a review of each fund, especially their fee structure.
If they are all going to be offering essentially the same service(holding representative selection based on market cap), there's no reason to charge really high management fees.

Now if there's only a time lag, then your friend can become the ultimate alpha trading signal for crypto hedge funds.

And there's a non negligible chance he lobbied hard to make it happen. ICOs represents a decrease in bitcoin dominance, and the dominance of the biggest BTC mining equipment producer and mining pools.

Hypothetically let's say China succeeds in eliminating 30% to 50% of current global bitcoin mining power, what would actually happen in such a scenario? Would the market cap of bitcoin decrease by an according amount in the short term?
