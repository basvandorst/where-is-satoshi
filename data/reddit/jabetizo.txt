Consumers may soon be able to pay for their Airbnb rentals or Uber car rides using bitcoin.
EBay Inc. has been quietly working to integrate acceptance of the virtual currency into its Braintree payments subsidiary, part of its PayPal unit, according to people familiar with the matter.
Those people said PayPal officials have meet in recent weeks with several companies that facilitate bitcoin transactions, including Coinbase Inc. PayPal has yet to reach any agreements, the people said. The timing of when Braintree would accept bitcoin is dependent in part on such a deal.
Braintree provides software for payments processing to many online and mobile companies like Uber and Airbnb.
EBay and PayPal wouldn't initially accept bitcoin, the people familiar with the matter said, but that could change over time. EBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told The Wall Street Journal last year that he was considering ways to use bitcoin.
A deal would provide a boost to bitcoin, a virtual currency that backers believe can someday displace cash or credit cards in many transactions.
Overstock.com Inc. OSTK +1.04%  is among the biggest retailers that accept bitcoin, through a deal with Coinbase struck earlier this year. Overstock said this week that it expects sales of goods using bitcoin to be $6 million to $8 million this year and to average $1 million a month by year-end.
Braintree was processing more than $12 billion in payments annually when it was acquired by eBay EBAY -0.02%  in December for $800 million in cash.
Bitcoin is created by computers solving complex math problems. Once created, bitcoins can be traded on currency exchanges or used as money to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept it.
Because ownership and many transactions are recorded, backers believe the virtual currency is less subject to fraud. Some bitcoin users have adopted the currency because it isn't backed by any country and can be traded with less scrutiny.
But bitcoin has been plagued by volatility and the collapse of a major exchange. The currency was being sold on some exchanges for more than $1,000 at one point last year and is trading at about half that value today. The value of all bitcoin is $6.7 billion, according to Coindesk's price index.
The virtual currency is also attracting regulatory scrutiny. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month that it is soliciting comments about virtual currencies, potentially prefacing legal action against bitcoin marketplaces suspected of violating consumer law.

A Lake Tahoe property sold Thursday for $1.6 million—in bitcoins.
The property is one of just a handful of residential real estate transactions in months that have used virtual currency—and potentially a record in terms of price. The price in bitcoins was 2,739.
The 1.4-acre acre home site has views of the Pacific Crest, a surrounding mountain range. It is located in Martis Camp, a private luxury recreational resort in Truckee, Calif. The 2,177-acre resort, near Lake Tahoe's north shore, has a Tom Fazio golf course, a 44-seat movie theater and an "aerial adventure park" with rope courses and a zip line.
Brian Hull, Martis Camp's director of sales, said the buyer was a "Silicon Valley entrepreneur," but declined to disclose his name. He said the buyer purchased the land through a trust, and plans to build a home on the site.
The idea to pay for the Tahoe property with bitcoins came from the buyer, said Mr. Hull. "When we originally heard the idea of bitcoin, everybody had a little pause," he said. "We weren't educated at how the transaction would go."
The digital currency was introduced in 2009 and isn't backed by a central bank or government. It can be created by a computer process known as "mining" and traded online through unregulated Internet exchanges. The value of bitcoins, which began at just pennies, has fluctuated over the past few years. The price of a bitcoin topped $1,100 in late 2013, but is now around $590 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index and can shift significantly throughout the day.
BitPay, an online-merchant processor that operates similarly to PayPal or Worldpay, handled the Tahoe transaction. Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's vice president of marketing, said about 85% of the site's merchants are online retailers. Teslas and Lamborghinis have also been purchased with bitcoins through the site.
To transfer property using bitcoins on BitPay, the seller creates an invoice for the price of the property, either in bitcoin or U.S. dollars, as BitPay can pay out in either currency. The bitcoin exchange rate is guaranteed for 15 minutes after the invoice is created, during which the purchaser must complete payment. If the payment isn't completed within the allotted time, the exchange rate is recalculated.
In March, an anonymous buyer paid 800 bitcoins, or more than $500,000, for a two-bedroom luxury villa in Bali. In May, a home in suburban Kansas City sold for about $500,000 in bitcoins through BitPay. BitPay says the Lake Tahoe home site is the most expensive property transaction they've handled far, though not their largest purchase in general.
Several sellers have tried listing their properties in bitcoins, including a Las Vegas real-estate developer who asked $7.85 million for his 25,000-square-foot home. He has since taken the property off the market, according to his listing agent. BitPremier, a website that sells luxury items in exchange for bitcoins has listings for homes, including one in Naples, Fla., for $969,000 (1,643.373 bitcoins) and a 9,845-square-foot house in the Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, Calif., for $7.45 million (12,627.119 bitcoins).
"As far as I know, this would definitely be a record breaker" for a publicly disclosed property sale using bitcoins, said Alan Silbert, CEO of BitPremier, which wasn't involved in this deal. The previous record was likely the villa in Bali.
Mr. Hull, of Martis Camp, said the company is now open to using bitcoin for future sales. "We're in the business of dealing with predominantly the Bay Area," he said. "A lot of our buyer base is in the tech sector, and there are a lot of people who have bitcoin holdings."

For the near future, it is the block reward in USD that matters. If transactions start staying unconfirmed for days, Bitcoin's reputation will be damaged for a long time -&gt; bitcoin adoption/price &amp; block reward in USD will go down.
If we keep a 1 MB block size limit, we will probably also miss out on potential adoption as big players won't want to join a network with max 3 transactions per second.

It's in my grandparent comment. If 1 billion people use bitcoin and make just 3 transactions per year to "hoard", we would need 100 tps.


So you are saying bitcoin needs 0 transactions per second? By any reasonable definition, hoarding is saving/accumulating (much) more than you spend/circulate.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:03:28
You haven't answered my first point about 3tps not being enough even for hoarding.


Why not? I am "hoarding" most of my coins in cold storage while using a small portion for occasional spending.
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:11:32


I don't follow your reasoning. Why is the scenario where people can only hoard better than the scenario where individuals can **choose** to hoard OR to circulate? Your vision is comparable to the [recent]( Chinese ban on big stock sales. Artificial restrictions will encourage people to look for alternatives. (Of course I don't support any increases that hurt decentralization, but we are not arguing about technical limitations here.)
Do you at least agree that if we decreased bitcoin's transaction capacity from the current 3 tps to 1 transaction per month, the price would drop as people would look for alternatives?
Something else from the article:


The truest hoarders, who have 100% of their net worth in bitcoin and see it as the perfect store of value, will still need to make occasional transactions for daily spending.
It is possible for example for 98% of bitcoin to be "hoarded" in cold storage while the rest has a high velocity. Just because it's not practical with gold doesn't mean it can't be with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:30:45


Even for 1 billion people to make 3 ("hoarding") transactions per year we need approx 100 tps.
Also, why limit the use to hoarding only while there are safe ways to increase capacity for other uses?

@_date: 2016-06-26 14:50:10
That's why, as the parent commenter stated, we have to get the balance (transaction fee vs security/centralization) right. If an altcoin does it better, it will take over.

Sorry, I misunderstood your point, thinking it was "the government does not confiscate private property".
If your point was "the government does not torture people", I think I don't need to give Wikipedia links.
If your point was "it would not be efficient for the government to torture all bitcoin owners", I don't think anyone here disagrees with that. But deniable encryption is still useful for individual cases or private thieves.

I don't think I do. To the average Joe keeping money in a bank account with a card attached to it, the money is not "locked up" since he can spend/withdraw it almost anywhere. Also, everything is priced in USD so from his point of view the value doesn't change drastically. If he wants to try out Bitcoin, currently he can buy $5 worth on Circle/LBC, withdraw to his mobile wallet and buy something with it.
If I understand LN correctly, this use case will not be feasible. BTC will need to be locked up and could only be redeemed if you close the channel or spend the exact remaining amount with someone that accepts Bitcoin. Which practically means everyone that wants to use LN needs to hold BTC. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

A cryptocurrency exchange that claims real dollars back its popular digital coin Tether raided those reserves to cover up $850 million that went missing, the New York Attorney General’s office said Thursday.
State Attorney General Letitia James said Hong Kong-based iFinex Inc., which operates the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange and owns Tether Ltd., has been commingling client and corporate funds to cover up the missing funds, which occurred in mid-2018 and hadn’t been disclosed publicly.
The attorney general’s office said it has obtained a court order directing iFinex to stop moving money from Tether’s reserves to Bitfinex’s bank accounts, halt any dividends or other distributions to executives and turn over documents and information. The coverup drained at least $700 million from Tether’s reserves, according to the attorney general’s office.
Attorneys for iFinex didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and representatives of Bitfinex and Tether weren’t immediately available.
The attorney general’s findings emerged from an investigation into cryptocurrency exchanges that it launched in 2018 and is continuing. A report in September warned that many exchanges lacked basic safeguards and left consumers vulnerable to exploitation by market manipulators.
A so-called stablecoin, Tether is purportedly backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars. Yet the firm has never released a public audit showing it has the reserves to back the coins in circulation, leading many to question whether the funds exist.
Tether has marketed the coin as a way to get both the safety of the dollar and the speed and anonymity of a digital currency. Its market value has risen steadily over the past two years, to $2.8 billion from about $10 million at the beginning of 2017.
It has become a major source of liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. About 80% of all bitcoin trading is done in Tether, according to data from research site CryptoCompare.
The attorney general said Bitfinex’s problems began in 2018, when it handed over $850 million to third-party payments processor Crypto Capital Corp. to handle customers-withdrawal requests. Over the months that followed, Panama-based Crypto Capital failed to process the orders, the attorney general said.
Representatives of Crypto Capital weren’t immediately available for comment.
By November of that year, according to people close to the attorney general’s investigation, Bitfinex determined that it had permanently lost access to the $850 million. To hide the missing funds, Bitfinex and Tether engaged in a series of maneuvers that drained Tether’s reserves, the people said.
A gap of that size would represent a major portion of Tether’s reserves. Tether currently claims on its website that the coins it issues are backed by reserves that include currency, cash equivalents and other assets and receivables. The language was altered in March; it previously claimed the reserves were 100% in currency.

Vision for bitcoin beginning to fade
Izabella Kaminska
Cryptocurrencies stormed into the public consciousness in November 2013 when the price of just one bitcoin broke through the $1,200 level.
The activists promoting the new breed of people-issued money claimed it would replace inflationary central-bank currency, enabling consumers to bypass the high commission charges and regulatory restrictions of traditional banks.
“It gives everyone in the world access to finance and the ability to transact with each other,” says Chris Ellis, one of the early supporters who always believed bitcoin’s potential was in democratising finance for millions of unbanked people. “The only barrier to entry is the use of a network-enabled digital device like a smartphone or a computer. “
But one year on, and despite growing popularity with retailers such as Expedia, Overstock and IBM, an FT look into digital currencies as part of the “Democratising Finance” series shows that things have not turned out as the community intended.
Bitcoin prices have collapsed in recent months. For most of January they traded below $250, incurring heavy losses for those who bought in at more frothy levels and challenging the profitability of the businesses involved.
Message boards once filled with enthusiasts now feature critical voices that question the system’s long-term viability and structure.
Bitcoin was the brainchild of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto presumed today to be the nom de plume of a group of secretive cryptologists.
It was supposed to provide a way to sidestep third parties — banks and other foreign exchange providers — and create an alternative system that could essentially be run by users themselves.
But its anonymity gained it a reputation as the currency of choice for drug dealers and money launderers, while its volatility brought it to the attention of speculators.
Gradually companies are starting to accept bitcoin but its use is limited to a few global corporations and some local businesses keen to jump on a trend.
There are still concerns over whether mainstream adoption can ever happen in an environment where message-board commenters claim “consumer protection is non-existent” and where price volatility turns even a coffee purchase into an unpredictable expense.
The high-profile scandals of the past year have included the $620m collapse of the Tokyo-based currency exchange Mt Gox, the theft of $5m coins from Bitstamp, one of the key exchanges based in the UK, and several small-scale frauds, hacks and embezzlements that drain funds from users.
The bitcoin system processes about 100,000 transactions a day compared with Visa’s 150m. But only about 1 per cent of the bitcoin total represents actual buying and selling of goods and services, with the rest linked to spam, money laundering and double counting, according to Jeffrey Robinson, money laundering expert and author.
Most of all, the newly disillusioned bitcoin community is confused about how a system that was supposed to be decentralised and owned by no one has ended up being anything but.
Tim Swanson, a consultant to the industry, says bitcoin is too complex to achieve that goal. Rather than eliminating the need for third-party agents, he says it has spawned a whole industry of people needed to process it.
“If you introduce third parties it defies the point . . . All it does is create an extra cost,” he says. “You just end up replicating the old system, but without the features that provide functionality for customer service.”
Bitcoin fees for users are low. But they are in effect subsidised by speculative buyers. If prices fall, Mr Swanson warns that fees will rise, making it less competitive versus traditional payment methods. He estimates that the true cost of each bitcoin transaction is $15-$20.
The smart money, according to one developer of a rival system, was never invested in bitcoin directly but in the supporting infrastructure. These businesses could one day be redeployed to new and improved cryptocurrency systems or even to traditional currencies.
Meanwhile, a growing number of bitcoin intermediaries are moving to work within the established financial market.
Coinbase, the San Francisco-based start-up that lets people store, send and accept payment in bitcoins, has launched its own US dollar wallet service and broke records in January when it raised $75m from investors including the New York Stock Exchange and several banks.
The presence of traditional financial services companies and figures was interpreted as an indicator of growing investor interest in mainstream applications of the digital currency.
But some banks worry the technology could become too expensive, especially if speculative flows are removed or the cost of regulation is factored in.
Richard Brown, executive architect for banking industry innovation at IBM, says: “There are lots of claims made for this technology, many of which don’t stand up to scrutiny.”
