It's all he would talk about man. Would always tell us about "both of you" chillin in the basement with 9 computers. How you guys made your money through a scam helped by two lesbian chicks in canada. All kinds of shit.
And dont you go knockin my newbie hacker skills! You have no idea how much fun I have netstating pedophiles on omeagle and telling them where they live. Well... I can get it down to the city. Thats enough to scare silly fetish freaks.

In my defense, this is one of those stories that gets passed around so much that the facts are lucky to be intact by the end of it.

When I was about 15-16, there was this guy who was claiming to be his son in yahoo chat rooms. He taught me cool tricks for MSDOS. Like using echo, and tracking people down via netstat commands. Oh, and ping of death. Though, i apparently sucked at that.
I dont even know if the real chris ever had a son. I do know he mailed me a bag of fritos with "Hey - Chris" printed on the use by part of the bag. Proving to me that he either
A. Was seriously good with computers aka hacking
B. Worked at a frito lays plant 
Either way, as a teen, i was very impressed.

Hell, they say they're in the town of 3000 people 2 minutes away from me lol.
But on topic, yes. Probably something very similar.

Helpful, but not necessary. I used to strip on cam in my teens, so dude warning me about that is actually what lead to him teaching me to track people down, ping of death, etc...
But yeah, iirc cam views are also pretty direct links between viewers. I dont pretend to be a computer guru/hacker guy. I wouldnt even know what to do in c++ lol. But tracking ip's hasnt seemed to change much since my teens. I only know it still works because I've gotten people so terrified that I was an agent that they gave up tons of info. Even tried bribing me.
Im really just sittin here on the computer with my gf half the time lookin for some weirdo trying to talk to young boys/girls lol

My old kirby boss used to hate me for it. We'd pull up at a house, and I'd say "Sold 2300" or a similar number depending on neighborhood etc...
If I guess'd "Not even close" he'd either pull right out. Or he'd send the guys no one liked in to get them out of the van for a few hours :p
*I was that fucking accurate at guesstimating*

My old homie hassan used to do a very particular whistle when walking our block. It's how he knew if friends were near. We would whistle back.
I had just started a job at Jack n the Box, and was sitting on my steps waiting for the bus to make it's appearance. And these 3 Navajo came walking up. They all 3 looked like guys, but one was a girl. Well, hassan was drunk as shit, and I heard his whistle. Not having any time for his drunk ass, I paid no attention hoping he wouldn't notice me. But the natives... They were drunk, and didn't know what was going on. So they started whistling. Well, here he comes, with his bulldog. 
Now, I'm a reformed thug. We used to be horrible fucking people. I knew shit might go down, but I stayed on my stairs just watching to see what he was alike when he was *alone*. 
Turns out, he's 10X as mean alone as he was in our little crew. This motherfucker starts beating all of them. One of them takes off like a little bitch. The other one stood there and took all the hits to the face, and just kinda did the coward thing. But then he slapped the chick, and I had to get down there. When she was like *"Wtf bro, I'm a girl."* he literally say's *"Shouldn't be lookin like a man then"*. 
I've been in mma for a while, but it took all I had to get his mean ass out of that situation. He was damn near ready to pull out his fucking gun. *Over a god damn whistle*. 
Anyway, your comment made me remember that and for some reason I felt like posting it.

A wild hacker appears!
Yeappers, thems were the days. Running around yahoo chat rooms in "Hacker Gangs", booting up the Ytunnel, loading up your boot programs. Logging in all 20,000 of your fake accounts, spam bombing people you didn't like.
I understand it's appeal since I was 15 yrs old. But holy shit, there were a ton of 30+ yr old people actin a fool with me. Looking back, I was absolutely running with a dumbass crowd. 
(I've also never met any of them. Except the cougars who wanted the dingus)

Right? I love res tagging other gw posters. Then seeing them in the wilds of reddit. 
But it's even funnier tagging people who post meme's about how awkward they are. Like the dude who "Cupped the girls vagina for 2 hours". I love bringing that shit up whenever I see him post more of his awkward shit. *"Maybe if ya'd quit cupping girls pussy's"* lmao
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:04:12
Oh yeah!
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:44:48
Which part? I consider them both creepy on some level.
Or just the fact that youre no where near as safe on the internet as you think?
Remember that one guy who tracked down a COD player who tortured him with endless knife kills? The guy tracked him down... And stabbed him in the chest....
As if it was the other guys fault that he sucked at the game.

Someone's been lookin at my gw posts :p
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:23:20
Command prompt, netstat -n, google an ip tracking website, and go through the list of ip's you brought up. 
Something about it only working in chat clients that link you directly to a person. Such as yahoo IM. Doesnt work on facebook.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:47:27
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:00:19
With your command prompt.... Netstat -n. Brings up the list of connected ip addresses. Hokus pokus, and bobs your uncle.
