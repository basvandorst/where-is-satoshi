Assuming the price of bitcoin is stable which it isn't. Put yourself in the shoe of the average Indian. You're sending money back to your family, by the time they receive the money to the moment they're able to cash it out into rupees, the price could have dived 20%. This does not bode well when you need to pay for your kids education, or your grandparents healthcare. I wouldn't take the risk and rather suffer the fee of international money transfer.
Edit: Are people downvoting me because they disagree or because what I'm saying is actually invalid?
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:27:57
YES! That's exactly my point. There's no regulation forcing BTC 'banks' to insure people's wallets. If your coinbase wallet gets hacked, they're not liable in any way and there's nothing you can do about it. So no regulation in this case IS a downside. If I'm a business and I want to store my wealth in bitcoin, I can't be protected from theft.
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:35:57
I'm a bitcoin advocate, I'm just highlighting that sending bitcoins home isn't a great idea **currently**. If you can't agree with that then you're deluded.
Believe it or not, I'm on your side. But you need to be reasonable, blatantly promoting bitcoin puts you on par with those that blindly reject bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:20:33
Whilst I agree with that on a logical level, I think socially it's quite challenging to do.
Taking away HSBC's banking license would have monumental consequences on the global economy. But at the same time you can't let Bitinstant get away with what they did. Yes there is a double standard but I'll leave that to smarter people to solve (or dumber).

You sir, are a troll. The competition isn't doing anything that innovative. All they're doing is putting a pretty interface over the bitcoind api. That's it. What's wrong with having another competitor join the arena? They offer insurance which is their competitive advantage. Something that nobody else offers.
Yes...of course the insurance is going to cover their servers and if they get compromised. Do you think current banks will insure you if your bank account get's compromised? You might but it's highly unlikely.
How is it the same everywhere else? Coinbase gave back bitcoins as a courtesy...not because they were legally obligated to.
Stop the hating man. You're only argument is that "other people have already done it" which is so childish. So fucking what if other people have done it. Before facebook there were dozens of other social networks. It's all about implementation.

This is hardly 1 hour scale. My uncle is a farmer living on less than $1 dollar a day. You want him to sacrifice 4 hours of his day travelling just so to convert money when he could be farming or you know...feeding his family?
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:01:55
Like I said, put yourself in the shoe of the average indian. 1/3 of the country lives under $1 a day. 96.9% live under $5 a day. You're assuming you have access to internet or facilities that can facilitate the transfer. Currently this is not feasible. Bitcoin itself is incredibly difficult to use even for the average person in a developed country. It'll be even more so for people in the 3rd world.
@_date: 2014-01-22 13:06:35


Shit...I sure hope so. A business that doesn't make money by doing business is a shit business.


Why the fuck should they give back? That's like saying grocery stores should share profits with the customers.


How do I pay for it? I don't pay any bank fees and earn high interest rates through my bank. They offer convenience and security. I take responsibility of my own business by being security conscious and using a bank and not hiding my money under a mattress.


Fuck me. Yes of course it's a positive thing. But we're not talking about Bitcoin here. We're talking about the regulation of BTC 'banks' which don't exist. There's no regulation for the existence of chemicals (well...with some exception). But there is regulation on pharmaceutical companies.


I majored in computer science and I can assure you that whilst everybody that graduated understand the concepts of encryption, we would be stupid to think about implementing it ourselves. Why? Because someone out there has done a much better job than us and provided its use for free. People in the future will laugh at us for trying to manage our own wallets. Strong password, 2FA, paper wallets, offline pcs is fucking stupid if you ask me. That's like the equivalent of buying a safe, putting all your money in it and then burying it somewhere only you remember. Too many factors can go wrong. I'd rather not mess around with my fortune and have the ego to think I can do it better than someone else.
Sorry for this long post. I can understand people won't agree with me. But we early adopters NEED to understand that the issue isn't Bitcoin as a piece of technology. It's the social-economic factors that we will need to solve. One of which is that people are just too scared of putting their wealth in Bitcoins.

Fuck me. Every single time anybody mentions the lack of regulation as being a bad thing I see this comment. Can you guys stop and and TRY to understand it from their perspective? A bank offers security. If a bank gets robbed, I can be certain that the money is insured and I won't lose anything. Who secures bitcoins? Nobody. Not all regulation is bad.
@_date: 2014-04-01 07:33:43
So I'll say it again, I pay in whatever currency is cheaper after all the processing. I won't pay in bitcoin just for philosophical reasons.

I personally find it stupid to not buy from amazon just because they don't accept bitcoin. I buy in whatever currency is cheaper like any rational person would. Just because they deal in bitcoin doesn't mean I'll be flocking to them.

I'm not saying bitcoin will fail, I'm just saying this is nothing to be excited about since currently it's too hard to use bitcoin in India. You have to convert it into fiat in order to use it, if you're the person sending money back home you're creating MORE of an inconvenience for them just so that you don't have to pay the international wire fee.
I would argue that you're short sighted in your ignorance of the 3rd world. Let me put things into perspective:
1. I send money to my uncle in India who is a farmer living in a village with no internet
2. I call my Uncle telling him I've transferred bitcoins to him
3. He needs to travel 2 hours to the nearest village to use their internet to transfer the money onto an exchange for fiat
4. He then needs to wait another day to get the money off the exchange and into his bank account
If there's a service like bitpay, it would mitigate this situation but as is, it's more considerate to transfer fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:11:37
They might be untrustworthy but it's the small to medium sized businesses that would suffer the most if they failed. When the GFC occurred who really lost?
It's so easy for to criticise banks when they're caught for money laundering and ignore all the value that they provide, the exact opposite of when someone criticises bitcoin for it's money laundering abilities.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:05:40
1. You don't need 200k+ to put down a deposit for a home
2. You're assuming everyone keeps all their bitcoins in one address
3. You assume that people won't buy more bitcoins to pay in bitcoins IF paying in bitcoins is cheaper
A home is something that most people would want to own and having the option to pay in bitcoins in any part of the process is a good thing.
If you can't agree with that then we'll just have to agree to disagree.
When we can purchase one of the most important things in our lives (e.g. a house) in bitcoin then I would say that it's part of our everyday life.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:48:08


Tell that to all the people who have lost their livelihoods.


I totally agree. Banks offer no value whatsoever. They should all be wiped out and we should all hide our money under our mattresses.

Anyone who is security conscious would not jailbreak their phones to have bitcoin running. The best thing to do is get wider acceptance of bitcoin in general and force Apple to enter the market. Apple has ~$80bn in the bank and couldn't care less about some currency with a market cap of $1bn.
@_date: 2013-05-20 06:22:51

The issue here with the USA is that the taxes are spent on crap. The issue isn't taxes itself. I can see your perspective but you're arguing a different problem. Taxing bitcoins is a good thing because it's another valid use for bitcoins. Where those taxed coins go to is a different question.

I know a lot of people in this sub bring out the pitchforks every time somebody mentions regulation, but we have to understand that regulations are there to prevent people from abusing the system. Theoretically if bitcoin takes off and somebody does try and abuse the system, then you could move to an altcoin but realistically, that's not going to happen especially if bitcoin receives wider adoption.
You can see that as soon as MtGox was getting DDoSed with tiny trades people began slamming MtGox for not doing something about it to filter out the small trades. That in itself is regulation! When things run smoothly, people don't want red tape. As soon as some people decide to abuse the system, people will scream for regulation.

People need to stop associating taxes with being evil. There's absolutely nothing wrong with paying your taxes which is a social duty. A country cannot operate without taxes, a currency cannot have national or state approval if it isn't going to be taxed in some way. Unless you're living in the UAE, taxes are a norm.
Imposing a tax on bitcoin is great news. It legitimises the currency and proves that it can be of use for the government.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:44:59
On one hand I think it'll allow jailbroken users access to the app but on the other hand you're encouraging non-jailbroken users to escape the application sandbox which is extremely dangerous. What if the cydia repo gets compromised and BitCoinStealer.app gets installed? I don't know. Rather than getting around Apple's walled garden I think it'll be more effective educating and promoting bitcoin to Apple (no matter how futile it may seem).

You could argue that nobody is forced to trade with Gox, but then again you're not forced to live in a particular country and obey it's rules either. There's probably a line somewhere. I don't see a problem with Gox addressing it's issues to prevent people from abusing it's system just like how I don't see a problem with government regulations as long as they're produced sensibly. Didn't America experience the strongest economic growths after the depression due to heavy government regulation? After years of deregulation, you ended up with the GFC.

Well, firstly, I don't live in the US. Also, yes, I would still pay my taxes because I'm a valuable contributor to society.

Ownership: You own the login, but you don't own the data, the data is still owned by the content provider. This is no different to openid, fb, twitter. Even if I delete my fb/twitter, the account on the content provider will continue to exist. Bitcoin ID would not solve this.
Control: Same as ownership. It's still up the content provider to allow me to delete data
Privacy: I agree with you here, but does it offer that much more privacy than me creating my own openID?
Barrier to entry is also a problem. The speaker doesn't address how it'll allow kids without BTCs access. Also, most people who signup to websites generally would like to use it straightaway, having a time/cost constraint applied would just deter them to using another login protocol.

Learning about xorg.conf is NOT fun. It might be better now...but still miles behind OS X or Windows. The only thing that I do miss is apt-get.

Are there even any Aussie BTC meetup groups? I've looked but couldn't find any!

Traditional forums don't encourage "conversations" and are extremely hard to follow for anyone new reading. The guy that created stackiverflow is creating a more modern forum called "Discourse" which hopefully will address the failings of traditional forums.
