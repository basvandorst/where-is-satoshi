 It does not. You kind of log in to them together and then are redirected to pro

High fees but Gemini allows you to purchase/trade immediately with ACH transfer but there is a similar waiting period before you can withdraw. ACH transfers aren’t instant with any use even
Outside the crypto world. Kraken is decent but you can pretty much only wire money on there ($5 fee from them + what your bank charges)
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:26:26

@_date: 2019-07-05 00:41:27
Yup, the delay is killer. For cash app what is the general timeframe before you can cash out? Is it like Gemini where you can purchase crypto right away but have days on hold before you can withdraw?
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:40:32
No you just sign up
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:54:14
I know I was in the same boat as you. I thought there was something complex of further steps but nothing harder than the original sign up from what I remember

In short They use your money in investments that can earn more than 6%, so it certainly has it’s risks
@_date: 2019-03-10 13:32:27
I think if you describe it as their account it won’t be lame! They can go on and check the balance whenever they want while you still maintain the utmost security for them. Just give them the public address and how to look at it. You can describe it as theirs in safe keeping and they will appreciate it all the same. 
Sounds like if the parents are or the “scam” mentality they may not be the best at storing it securely/keeping up with the keys.

If said person has Coinbase they can get Coinbase pro. The fees there are less than your local bitcoins mentioned at 1% and infinitely less risk. Even if you hassle with multiple sellers there is still a chance one of them will rob you and you’d lose more than the most expensive exchange fee of say $900.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:15:07
Yeah and I said description but I meant the pinned post

I’ve seen some merchants just say send your txid and amount of BTC transferred after payment and then they’ll ship the goods. Never had an issue. More work for them, but was easy enough for me.

It is taxable on many levels under capital gains taxes (several forms you have to add to your returns). You have to report any crypto-fiat trades and crypto-crypto trades as either a gain or a loss by figuring out the cost of the coin when you purchased and again at the time of sale. If there was any gain/loss then you pay the respective taxes on it. Please note this is against the USD. This was very exciting to come up with after the fact. I had to use a 3rd party ( to compile all of my transactions. 
This can be great in a bear market (say you’re beating BTC but losing against the USD), but you could gain some serious tax implications in a bull market. You should be setting aside a % gains to satisfy what is owed if applicable so you don’t get behind. This was/is a huge issue for 2017 traders. They had HUGE tax implications with the run up even if you just only traded crypto and didn’t cash out. Then, the market crashed and they do not have the $$ to pay those tax implications since they were still all in on crypto. 
The only way it is not taxable if you bought and HODLed. 
This is a very brief summary so depending on how many transactions you have it would make sense to talk to a tax professional so you don’t get in too deep and start having interest and other fines add up.

Comparing apples to oranges a bit here. Amongst other things, Silver/gold is not easily divisible in small increments making it a pretty poor payment system.

@_date: 2019-02-12 12:20:29
Basically they allow you to put in all your transactions (or you can give them read-only API to your accounts) and they come up with the costs basis for you based on historical data along with calculating any losses/gains for historical trades. They are partnered with turbo tax and with coinbase so the coinbase side of it is pretty straight forward. They will also prepare your tax documents for you for a nominal fee depending on how many transactions.  
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:14:15
I just almost spit out my coffee. The contents are planted! :-)
@_date: 2019-02-09 13:08:31
How many trades back and forth did you do? 
If it was just one Bitcoin &gt; BCH what you need to do is calculate the USD cost of the Bitcoin the time you purchased it and then the USD cost of BTC at the time you “sold” it (transferred to BCH). Subtract the sales price from the original purchase price and you’ll come up with either a positive (gain) or negative (loss) number. 
If you are still holding the same BCH with no further trades then there is only 1 taxable event (the trade itself). 
You’ll need to fill out a form 1040 schedule D along with form 8949 or if you’re using turbo tax you just type in your transactions and it’s pretty easy saying it’s only this one or a few.

For digital on-boarding I prefer Gemini. Rates tend to be good and no fees charged by them to transfer out to your wallet, just a relatively fat 1% fee of trade volume (I only do USD &gt; crypto on it). Haven’t had any issues with verification since the original one. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:13:54
Mt Gox or Quadriga are good starting points

For the record trading crypto-crypto also counts as a taxable event so you can realize gains and losses this way, too.

Also, if you’re holding USD in the Coinbase pro account they claim it’s FDIC insured up to $250k per customer. You shouldn’t have an issue cashing out or having your funds held up if they are all in fact legitimately sourced, specially if it was all through Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:14:53
Trade Fees are reduced relative to Coinbase and to withdraw USD to your bank there is no charge and to withdraw crypto to your wallet there is no charge (not sure if Coinbase still charges for withdrawals). It has a better interface for trading overall, too

In a sense they play the role of the credit card processing companies we are trying to eliminate. Given their fee is less than CC fees, they are basically a 3rd party wedging themselves in-between the P2P transactions and taking a cut, which kind of goes against the idea of P2P money.
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:15:50
If you have Coinbase already I’d register for Coinbase pro. Lower trade fees and no withdrawal fees.

Using bitpay you have the choice to take the withdrawals in various crypto’s or fiat or a mix % of both
