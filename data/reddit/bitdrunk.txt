It's not ironic.  People are terrible are reaching consensus on anything.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:55:52
Because they don't know what they're talking about, or are lying.  Nobody 'owns' bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:50:24
I hope it does get to $50/tx.  Maybe you'll just fucking leave then?

Truth.  Stop being a slave to the invisible sky daddy.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:53:36
Not all of us are paranoid, and actually kinda understand how this Bitcoin thing works.  It's ok if you don't, but don't infect others with your 'feelings'.  You realize they'd still need to propose code to change anything? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:46:05
You're doing it wrong.  Next question.
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:38:06
It's very clear.  Fucking   You can keep saying it isn't... but it is.

Under $100k/btc.  ;)
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:15:23
How does that make any sense to you?  
Guy - Ok guys, the price is falling a little, what do we do?
Guy - How about we stage a hack and cause panic.  That should divert the attention from the falling price.
Yep... makes a lot of sense.  lol
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:45:53
And I thought I was drunk...
Have fun with your shit-coins then brah.  lol
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:29:48
It'll never happen, and shouldn't. End of discussion really. Gox was a lot bigger heist than this. If it didn't happen then, there's no way in hell it'll happen now.

'Ridiculously nonsensical' sums up your post perfectly.

If you look for doom and gloom... you'll find it anywhere.  I see you've been trying.  You make a lot of assumptions based on nothing more than a 'gut feeling'.

Thanks Nostradamus.

They can set up mining farms and get it that way.  No exchange needed.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:17:27
They also have a vested interest in reporting facts.  Looks like they did that.  Both of those interests happen to align.
I haven't fact checked the statement you made about Bloomberg being an investor in Coinbase, but I don't care enough to look into it.  Doesn't matter.

Are you this wrong about most things in life?  Careful out there buddy.  lol
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:43:11
It is.  I used to mine, but now I don't, so I sell dollars for them when needed.  With Bitwage I can also have all or a portion of my paycheck in btc.  Easy as that... sell things (dollars), or work for it via Bitwage.

I recently received a new card and it has a chip in it.  Apparently you can't just put the fucking card in the slot until they tell you to, otherwise "the system might go down".  That wasn't some random mom and pop shop... that was Home Depot.  lol.  Fuck that.

@_date: 2015-12-08 01:42:27
Is $68 really tempting you to sell?  If yes, then maybe you should sell and be done with it.

I also use Chase with Coinbase.  I've never had any issues.  You need to consider who is getting their account closed.  There are always reasons... just don't expect any from someone claiming to have had their account closed.
I primarily use USAA now though.  Fuck Chase!
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:13:18
You could use Coinbase or Circle and exchange it into dollars.  If not, find someone that will buy it.  Localbitcoin, Mycelium Wallet.  I don't sell btc personally, I only buy, spend, and hodl.  :)

It hasn't been hard to 'cash out' for quite a while now. Exchanges have been around for years.  Early adopters shouldn't be having problems with that.  This helps nothing in that regard.

I can't imagine that buying bitcoin was the only reason. I have an account with Chase and buy bitcoin from Coinbase frequently. I've spent several thousand on btc over the past couple years. Even had to go in and have them stop an ACH to Coinbase because the mobile app processed two transactions! They corrected the ACH and refunded any fees. I've had only great experiences with Chase and bitcoin.  What's the real reason they shut down the account?  Not buying it.

If someone believes that fairy tales are true, then I do question everything that person says. Religion is a dangerous mind virus, and as the late great Christopher Hitchens put it... religion poisons everything!
I'm not only an atheist, but an Antitheist. We must actively oppose delusion. If someone ACTUALLY believes what is in their 'holy books' and follows those fucked up rules, would you really trust them with anything?  Reallllly?

Bitcoin is 'real money'.  If you mean how do you convert it into fiat, sell it to someone.  An exchange, coinbase, circle, a friend, or just spend it on something.  Or just wait for PayPal to catch up so you can add it to your account.  ;)
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:11:18
It looks like it's just you actually. If you really thought this, you haven't been around here long.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:41:57
No, it's not the future.  It's the present.  It exists now, and is very useful as it currently exists, and will only get more useful in the future. If you value being in total control of your money, then you'll get it.  If not, then have fun with your "real" money.  lol
You really don't see how bitcoin is better than dollars/euros/whatever? You need to keep reading.  While I didn't fully understand it back in early 2011 when I got involved, I could sense the awesome of the idea.  Now almost 4 years later, I'm convinced bitcoin is the way forward.

I don't know how someone like Peter can get such a basic thing about bitcoin so wrong.  But If he isn't misunderstanding it, then he's lying, delusional, or being forced to spread misinformation, and can't or shouldn't be trusted.

It wouldn't create that many millionaires even at 10k/btc.  Lets say there will be 17million btc when it hits 10k. You need 100btc at $10k each to be a millionaire.  There can only be no more than 170,000 'new' millionaires at 10k/btc.  In reality far fewer than that own 100 btc or more.  Plus many of them might already be millionaires.
There are roughly 14-15million millionaires in the world.  50k-100k more is nothing.

@_date: 2015-01-20 17:51:32
Most people only bitch and moan about the world around them.  I'm very happy with Coinbase.  Never once have I had a bad experience.  I also don't post in their subreddit, as I would guess most people don't.  The real question is why are people complaining.  It's probably mostly their fault. Something they did or have done in the past.  They are probably high risk, bad credit history, etc.  I'm not going to say that Coinbase is faultless 100% of the time.  But I doubt people who complain are truly as innocent as they claim.  In that case, buy them locally.  Or maybe it's harder for them to scam that way?  Who knows.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:54:44

Create a consulting or administrative services business that you pay with bitcoin, and they deposit USD in a bank acocunt to pay bills and employees?  I'm sure that's legit.  ;)

@_date: 2015-01-13 14:02:31
I hear ya!  But if someone takes much of anything posted here seriously, I feel sorry for them. There's a LOT of noise, and only a little substance.
If this shit has people worked up, stressed out, or otherwise losing their mind... go take a long run, walk, or hike.  Clear your mind so you can think straight again.  ;)
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:33:04
Must they?  You've had issues like this happen to you before?
Seriously, would people like this just find a rope, go to their garage, basement, or nearest tree and do the world a favor?  I think you know what to do from there.

It's not meant to be negative.  I'm as positive about bitcoin as anyone.  Just trying to have a little fun.  And if you don't like Ricky, or The Trailer Park Boys, you can frig off!  ;)
Yes, I hodl many btc. I also educate friends and family, and ask any place where I buy things if they accept bitcoin.  I even offer to help them get set up if they are at all interested.

Why were you rejected?  You really can't think of any reason?  I haven't been denied, and won't be.  I also know exactly why I won't.  Just as I'm sure those that do get rejected have a good idea as to why as well.
Could there just be a misunderstanding somewhere?  Sure, but then it would be able to be resolved.  If it isn't, then that's a red flag to me.

Nearly all of my family and my friends use it.  I couldn't care less about the so called trend setters. Everyone that I know on FB has seen many posts about it over the years from me.  They may not know a whole lot yet... but I'll make sure it's worth their time to get to know more.  :)

Yep... no complaints here either.  ;)

Segwit does that.  It increases the block size and the community is behind it.  We might need to raise it more in the future.  Then again we might not.  We'll see after Segwit.  Or we won't and nothing changes.

Even though the fork won't happen I'll play along.  I'd sell that BU shitcoin as soon as I possibly could.  More REAL bitcoin for me.

Then why don't you spin up those 30 nodes?  Why doesn't everyone?  Because it's not a snap of the fingers and it's done.
Fuck off if you think that we're stuck with what miners choose.  You might be... the rest of us aren't.  Of course I'm just one guy, a few USB miners, and a full node... but I'm ready to fight!  I'll burn this fucker down before giving it up to BU scum.

They're not 'hodlers' if they sell.  They're traders.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:49:35
Get some USB miners.  There are some that can do 10-20Gh/s.  You'll make satoshi's but you're not doing it to make money.  If you can afford a USB miner or two and maybe a USB hub then go for it!  Otherwise check eBay for more powerful miners.  USB miners won't kill your electric bill at least.  :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:45:37
Nope it's segwit and it's associated increase and benefits then any other block size proposal.  Got it yet?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:10:07
No they don't.  It's 1mb.  They can't really do much about that without support from the entire community.

I'm all for that to an extent.  I'm going to run 10-15 USB miners at about 10-20Gh/s each.
I plan on getting up to 1Th eventually.  Bitcoin has been very good to me.  This is a little extra I can do to help secure the network and it won't break the bank.

You're right.  It's a lot like voting.  Alone I'm not doing a whole lot.  If enough do it then it might mean something.  Either way I love seeing those little miners running... lights flashing.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:39:58

Bitcoin depends on people for survival.  Reddit has people on it.  His message is posted on reddit where other people are.  And people need to take action.  Did that break it down simply enough for you there, brah?

@_date: 2016-06-18 11:40:28
Not at all close to the same.  Smart contracts are PART of ethereum, right?  RIGHT?  Gox wasn't PART of bitcoin.  See the difference now?  CAN YOU SEE?!?
@_date: 2016-06-07 13:18:00
Gold is hard to secure, and easy to confiscate.  I'll never own gold because of this.  It's useless to me.  If there's a time when it's needed.... well, lets revisit the hard to secure, and easy to confiscate problem that it has.
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:33:30
"I've been wondering how strong Bitcoin's code is"
It's open source, you can review the code.  You don't have to wonder.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:59:43
It actually is.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:54:15
So because of that it's not going to happen?  Solid logic.  Even at 100k/btc it's not going to make a lot of people rich.  I'll be one that it does, but everyone else probably won't be.  ;)
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:53:38
I have been.  I think I'll be good with a few USB type miners for now.  If I can catch a good deal on eBay maybe I'll pick one up.
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:40:52
Yes, it is above the law.  You are the problem.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:13:57
Keep dreaming bud.  You give governments way too much credit.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:04:27
How many people do you think will actually need to know, and care about what it's called? I'm guessing very very few... and they'll know.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:04:07
There's a huge difference between the two events.  Good try though.
I don't plan on going out of my way to be supportive.  I'm not looking to be too big of an asshole either.  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:51:35
Attributing human qualities to a crypto currency.  Ain't that cute.
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:23:42
I'm never eating his TV dinners again!
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:03:53
I just checked my Trezor... it's all still there!  Good enough reason to dance anyway I guess.  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:28:44
Lets see, he thinks that the volume is a joke, and they're irrelevant.  Nah, he's not talking down though.
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:56:27
It's gone bud.  They're lost forever in btc purgatory.  Or... they're not.
@_date: 2016-06-24 12:13:28
Maybe you should learn more about it before typing nonsense.
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:33:42
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:45:45


Just because you keep saying this garbage, doesn't make it true.  Stop making a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:53:39
By straight down you mean down a little, then sideways?  Stay tuned.
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:05:31
Everything he said was correct.  All of it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:51:15
You go ahead and use monero or whatever shitcoin you want.  If you don't see what makes BTC the top dog then that's your problem.  lol
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:26:14
Bring on the stupid then!  Embrace it.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:04:09
lol.  Where's the /s in there?  Gotta be in there.  Gotta be.  Or you smoked that much eth that it made you retarded?
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:01:13
Trees are not stronger because they can bend a little.  I get that you're trying to make it fit into your fucked up thought... but that's a really stupid statement.  I'm sure other stupids will think it's great though.
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:07:56

If you gotta ask... just sell and move on with your life.
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:34:46
Well said.  The comparisons are getting old already.  
@_date: 2017-01-28 10:11:08
You shouldn't 'buy back in'.  Just stay out.  We have enough idiots around here.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:01:05
How did it go from under $200 last year, to $630 where it is today?  How did it go from zero to something in the beginning?  
I discovered btc when it was under $4.  It's all upward movement as far as I'm concerned.  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:42:52
Bitcoin doesn't need a community.  It needs users, and hodlers.  Seems to be coming along just nicely.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:31:22
I mined a fair amount of btc and bought just as much between early 2012 through mid 2016.  I've never sold a bitcoin.  I find it easy to do.  These levels don't get me that excited.  I've held for 5 years and it's going to take a HELL of a lot more upward movement for me to even consider moving anything out of btc.  The plan is not to have to.
I'm not a rich guy, just got a little lucky with the btc thing.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:14:40
Why not ask Circle what it could be rather than coming to reddit to whine about it like a little bitch?  $110 is nothing.  Get a grip man.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:33:10
Hodling since 2011.  Only the strong hands survive.
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:26:47
None of those are remotely similar to bitcoin.  Thanks for trying though.

He can talk about drugs no problem, he's an expert.  He has trouble with other things it appears.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:22:31
Suuuuure he will.  If it's even one person, which I'd doubt.  They're going to own all the eth if you kids keep this shit up.  lol
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:26:52
Add it to the rest of my btc in cold storage.  duh!
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:43:12
Is economic science similar to religious science?  aka not science?
*edit:  .... or political science?  lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:24:44
Oooooh yaaah, guy?  Such insight.  Good luck with that.
@_date: 2016-06-04 12:14:57
You're going to come here and give us a link to a shitty blog where some guy is whining about how a few people on Reddit made him feel bad?  So now the 'community' is against innovation?  What ever the hell that even means.
Tell you what bud, get out there and innovate, or STFU!
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:08:38
Plenty of space for what's needed.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:09:40
lol damn!
@_date: 2016-06-11 13:14:27
ONLY If you don't take precautions.  I can lose a hard drive a day and never lose my bitcoin.  So yeah... it's not 100% true.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:50:40


Negative.  I was buying that dip.  No mercy for the weak.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:05:39
Bitcoin doesn't want anything.  That's the beauty of it.  The question really is why people want to use it at Starfucks or McDonalds?
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:22:29
You're right down voting doesn't make what you said untrue.  It's just because it's untrue.  You get down voted because you're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:01:49
Well... but they didn't.  No need to spread lies.
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:17:26
No you didn't.  You've probably never had any btc.  The only disaster is that you're here.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:08:52
I never thought of that.  But I never claimed to be the smartest guy.  Interesting to think about.  Seems reasonable.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:23:17
I promise not to sell before $25k.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:26:49
Will segwit activate?  Depends how bad ole Roger and his asspack crew want 'bigger blocks'.  Otherwise... nothing should change... ever.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:14:25
No, I don't realize that because he hasn't proven himself to be.  What evidence?  Evidence would prove his claims.... RIGHT?

Every. Day.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:07:10
I agree, I don't understand how they can think it has anything to do with the brexit bullshit.  It's traders trading.  
Pro tip:  If you play the bitcoin market, you're probably going to have a bad time.
@_date: 2016-06-18 09:34:15
Yes, it can be used as a currency.  You're a fool.
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:24:56
It does a better job of it than you do.  You just get me interested in trolling and downvoting.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:28:47
I know to me it is.  I don't want to secure a metal that I can't use anywhere and is easily confiscated.  It would take more than 1oz of gold for 1 of my btc.  But... I be crazy yo.
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:39:26
I came to the same conclusion.  They removed the most useful thing about their app.  I removed it 2 days after the change.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:48:26
If I didn't know better, I'd believe this was the guy.  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:08:32
Maybe just stop lying to people in the first place and you wouldn't have this issue?
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:18:52
No luck needed.  You must be new.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:17:04
Maybe it was priced in... and now we're adding back what we had to take out to have the halvening priced in?  That must be it.  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:22:31
Exactly!  
I'm also tired of this comparison to early bitcoin.  It's not the same.  Toss eth into the alt pile.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:01:26
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:24:25
I'll be anybody's bitcoin for $300!  let me know.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:32:22
True, alts can rise radically.  They're also a good way to get fucked.  That's the sad result for most people.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:14:01
Not yet, bro.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:03:16
If they're not fucking retarded, they'll do just fine.  You play the trading game, you're probably not going to have a good time.
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:17:33
And we don't care.  weeeeeee
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:14:37
Good plan!  :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:10:19
lol what?  Reality check?  I think that's what you need brah.
Poor baby needs a nap.
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:41:22
Yes, February 2140 at least.
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:41:32
lol stop drinking the fud-aid bro.
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:35:50
Good luck with trying to discredit Andreas.  lol
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:56:23
Holy shit there's no way you got that many upvotes legit.  No way.  Gotta love the Rogtard Ver crew.  lol
Think about what he did.  Try for once in your life to put yourself in someone elses shoes.  Do you want to be carrying dangerous explosives totally unaware?  Do you want your loved ones carrying them?  He's a piece of trash.  He doesn't deserve a seat at the table.  If you support him you're just as big of a piece of trash as he is.  Bigger perhaps.  That says a lot about you as a person.
Of course there's more than just that I find retarded.  He's full of idot... just spills out of him onto everyone around him.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:55:23
Keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:55:43
Never going to happen.  Deal with it or leave.
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:54:57
It goes up, people get worried.  It goes down, people get worried.  It goes sideways, people get worried.  The lesson here is that people worry too much.  Why worry?  Trying to rally the fellow fearful?  lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:22:15
Yup.. that's the end of it.  /s  &lt;- In case it wasn't obvious.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:10:23
Is that a serious question you have?  Just keep thinking about it and it'll come to you eventually.  Or maybe it won't.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:12:40
Agreed...  sell those BTC guys!  I need to collect more under 1k.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:12:29
That gets an upvote!  2 of my favorite things.  Bitcoin and kitties.  ;)
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:46:39

No you really didn't.  Keep trying though!  
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:17:12
You have some?  Amazing.
@_date: 2017-01-09 11:21:00
They're getting shit done, son.  That's what they're trying to show and it's clear they are.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:43:27
Nothing has changed then.  This isn't a new revelation.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:32:49
That's not a feature of bitcoin.  In case you weren't sure.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:12:13
"Either hodl or don't play."
Agree 100%!  Or if you play, don't come here and whine like a little baby because you're an idiot and thought you could play the game.  Nobody cares about your loss.
@_date: 2017-01-04 09:06:39
It isn't.

Ya... a few months.  Such a long time.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:25:51
Hodl and BTFD's.  The only way to go.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:57:32
Shit I'm an awkward person so I can appreciate Luke.  I would want him no other way.  I love weird.  :)
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:46:46
Come on... what do you have to dump?  Got a few satoshi's and can't sleep at night?  You don't know what out of control is if you think this is it.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:18:28
Oh look another idiot that doesn't know how anything works.
@_date: 2016-06-03 12:38:00
Yes, you are.  Some people are more fearful of things than others.  Easily scared into thinking the sky is falling.  Well... it isn't.  
My confidence has never been shaken.  Each day bitcoin continues to exist builds upon that confidence.
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:57:54
You live in north korea?  I'm surprised you have internet!  You should look into bitcoin, and stop reading bullshit talking points from your dear leader.

No, they can't kill it anytime they want.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:53:15
It'll be messy and volatile until it isn't.  This current swing is nothing.  Noobs get scared when there are little ripples on the pond.  But I'm swimming out to surf a tsunami!  Get in the water, or GTFO!
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:00:42
Just wait until we can dump.  You'll see how fast that price is rising then.  lol
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:00:39
Then use them.  Nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:07:13
Keep doing what you've been doing.  Hodl, bro!
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:46:50
So it worked.  148 made SegWit happen, bro.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:53:34
Oh man... what are they going to do now??  lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:06:12
I never cared and it doesn't matter.  It's always been about the bits to me.  But you're part of the 1%.... right?
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:55:10
We remember but just don't care about another shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:41:48
The OP however, definitely not fucking.
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:19:01

Good read.  Thanks for posting!
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:20:52


I don't think so.  We all want to see great things for bitcoin.  It's how we get there that differs.  Thankfully not all of us are ready to sacrifice bitcoin the way Roger wants to.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:15:01
Bitcoin is fair.  Play by the rules and you're welcome to participate.  Been that way since day 1.  Nice try though.
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:43:34
Oh really?  How do you think that'll happen?
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:10:52


.... and either do you.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:13:25
Not really.  Just shows that it's good money.  What people decide to do with it is on them.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:51:46
Nah... I was thinking cunt more than asshole.
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:09:05
Roger is a clown.  Not a happy fun clown but a sad pathetic one.  I remember the first time I saw him.  I didn't trust his face back then but thought I was jumping to conclusions.  Interesting how it turns out that he really is a scumbag piece of trash.
Time erases everyone eventually.  That time can't come soon enough for him.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:26:54
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:03:07
If they'd get approved in my state I'd be using them already.  Been signed up since day 1 but can't use the service.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:50:43
No they won't be.  BTC on the LN is BTC.  Stop lying to noobs that don't know better.
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:04:26
/mic drop  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:17:16
They get what they deserve.  1 star is too much.  Who would use them again anyway?  Not many people I'd bet after they shit they pulled.
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:26:45
Might be... might not be.
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:55:37
Ya 'jack squat' is happening.  And you've been 'in BTC since 2010'?  I'm guessing you mean buttcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:41:43
Who's the box of rocks in the video that's basically saying bitcoin is like the first steam engine?  Wow.  Guess he has it all figured out.
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:31:49
I'm a hodler doing what hodlers do.  I hodl.
I never sell btc and I don't plan on it.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:17:31


Yes he would.  They all would love that.  Finally dear leader would watch over them and their big blocks with tender love.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:25:09
If you don't hodl you lose.  That's the lesson today.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:51:48
He's Venezuelan.  That's not good enough for you?  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:39:36
Nobody ever does.  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:01:11
Roger is an idiot.  Like you.
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:02:20
Nope... All my btc are still here.  I'll take more though.  Thanks panic sellers.  Lol
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:38:19
Exactly... They'll advise you on how to best hand over a lot of your money to them.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:01:49
We're tired of hearing people whine.  Sooooo... don't care.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:47:19
Added a few more btc to the stack.  Thanks to all that dumped.  lol
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:20:41
People are idiots as well.  Gotta call that shit out aggressively.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:08:32
The problem is little bitches that can't handle being on reddit.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:41:46
Why does anything?
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:20:54
I send btc often and I've never had to calculate the fee.  Use a better wallet if that's the case.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:28:48
I had to check the charts, I thought I missed something.  Where is this 'skyrocking' you speak of?
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:13:01
Clearly wrong.  You gotta try harder next time.  Unless you forgot the /s at the end?
@_date: 2016-11-17 10:15:47


I've seen Core devs in r/btc... so I guess that supports his claim that they endorse censorship.  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:27:55
Spoiler alert!!!  BU is the bug.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:36:07
Fuck it man... do it.  If you can handle the feeling in your stomach when the price fluctuates you'll do just fine.  :)
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:52:40
No it isn't.  Stop lying.  Or you're an ignorant fuck.  Either way you can fuck off.
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:12:59
And what exactly should we care about?  The value is THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS!
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:54:29
I hope he has.  He should dump all his BTC for BCH.
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:44:36
An asteroid hits earth or aliens kill us.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:05:09
Other than the FACT that 2X doesn't have consensus?  Now or ever.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:01:40
Yes it is.  Just follow the steps and you'll be able to sleep well at night.  Pick up a CryptoSteel as well.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:00:22
No. No.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:16:20
Nope.  Hope you do and be sure to sell all of your non existant real bitcoin before you leave.  You won't be missed.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:14:03
Kind of how I felt today.  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:57:39
Rare things happen ALL the time.  Being rare doesn't mean it rarely happens.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:06:01
Depending on the wife that might be a good deal.  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:52:52
Nah, it sounds about right.  As much as I hate saying that.  :(
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:41:46
It would make sense he'd do that.  God is a flawed idea, who cares if women are priests, and I'm very pro abortion so great.  I'm not so much into state worship so he'll continue to lose me there.  ;)
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:52:58
You think it's over brah?  Your torment has just begun.
@_date: 2016-06-24 12:55:33
Sometimes the only way to prevent a fire, is to burn it all down first?
@_date: 2016-11-06 09:49:08


I don't think you understand the difference between bitcoin and fiat shit paper.  Not to mention no bitcoin payment takes 'several days to confirm', or 50 cents for a fee unless you're an idiot.  Guess we figured out the problem.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:05:51
Vitalik is ass deep in his little ShitThereum project.  I could care less what he thinks about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:53:02
Exactly.  Fuck shitcoins.  People get mad when you say that because you're blowing up their scam.  Simple really.  Then turn it around like we're the fucked up ones.  lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:01:40


Dreamers... only some of us will.  ;)
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:53:33
Rick is a piece of shit.  Whatever good he might have done in the past doesn't matter.  He spread lies and FUD for too long.  He can fuck off.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:50:36
Did you edit the 'facts' out as well?  I only see a lot of opinion.  And you can piss off with it.
I hodl!  I hodl tight and ain't letting go for someone in Africa or anywhere else.  Fuck you if you think I should.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:20:20
Always hodl and btfd!  If you need money for something else... Just act like your BTC don't exist.  Figure out another way.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:18:26
Then you should have used your CC.  Easy solution.  You have a perfectly fine way to buy everyday useless shit.  For everything else there's btc.  How are people not realizing this?
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:16:35
I read it while masturbating.  Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:48:45
More forks!  Another shit-coin doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:54:32
No.. you're a cheap fuck.  Delusional?  It's you that needs to join us in reality, brah.
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:43:25
Yes, you probably are.  Your 'logic' might need an adjustment.
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:11:53
Really?  Does it?  I don't think it does.  Your comment says all I need to know about you.  Nothing.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:32:34
Wrong.  Idiot.
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:30:35
There are plenty of bitcoin clones.  Have fun with one of those.
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:44:25
derp deeerp derp... ya just change the number... derrrrrp.
@_date: 2016-12-21 10:30:39
Get creative!  :)
@_date: 2016-11-15 01:34:25
It'll be 100% piece of shit (POS).  We agree on that.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:41:47
Accidentally... or exactly as intended?  ;)
@_date: 2016-11-06 06:02:25
Awww poor baby needs a nap I think.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:06:20
I'll tell you for 5 bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:08:46
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:28:48
I agree... thanks!  I appreciate your insights.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:32:53
Thanks for saving us once again.  If only we knew he didn't really know!
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:22:27
You sleep until 4am?  Slacker!  :)
@_date: 2016-12-23 20:03:20
How do you have so much time to spam us with the garbage that dumps out of your little head?  I got tired after about 150 downvotes.  I'll get back to it later.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:32:54
Best use case by far!  ;)
@_date: 2016-11-26 09:50:38
Fuck you.
@_date: 2016-11-07 13:38:50
"Like" you're 5 years old, or because?

I thought it was Trailer Park Boys.

Consider tossing Joshua some btc to help him continue putting out great content!!
@_date: 2016-11-15 01:33:08
Whaaaaat... another shitcoin?  You don't say.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:23:26
So 45% each I guess.  A lot better than last time.  I won't even get into how bullshit that 90% number is.  Don't have to.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:53:44
Just stopped by to inform you that you're an idiot.  You must know that though... I can't be the first one to make this observation.
@_date: 2016-12-21 10:32:47
The only way to get that back would be to get out of eth and into btc.  Best way to make up for your losses.  ;)
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:00:51
Those individuals are the best ShitThereum can muster.  Doesn't inspire confidence.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:43:58
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:56:33
What's nonsense is you calling something nonsense and not knowing a god damn thing about it.  Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:26:55
lol yes... I was struggling with what I was feeling.  You nailed it.  ;)
@_date: 2016-11-04 14:06:54
This is ridiculous?  This is?  This?  lol
I love noobtards.  Never ending source of comedy.
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:30:37
You're an idiot.  I have more btc than you can ever dream of having.  My money is more than where my 'mouth' is... it's where my entire body is.  So piss off with your little kiddie small time bullshit.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:23:18
@_date: 2016-11-15 11:34:41
Where's the circle jerk?  Are you the pivot man today?
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:59:22
Ok I'll play along.  They fix the issue and bitcoin continues.  It still won't hit zero.
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:09:25
There will be block rewards in 2025.
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:54:39
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:27:17
Don't say that man.  You can do this.  Fuck ups happen.  Don't get to down on yourself.
@_date: 2016-11-11 00:09:51
False.  Your brilliant ideas might be better received in the ShitThereum subreddit.
@_date: 2016-12-20 09:15:53
Lol... Anyone thinking they know the future with any certainty is wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:07:40
No, it's not.  You don't understand bitcoin very well.  I can 'hide' shit all day and you won't have a fucking clue.
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:04:39
What's an 'extremely small group'?  How many drug buyers exactly?  How can you possibly know?  Where do you get your information?  How do we know is accurate? 
You see all those questions?  There is no way you have a good answer.  It'll just be more personal 'feelings' and whatever the fuck you try to call 'logic'.  You're another asshat on reddit with nothing to say.  Shocking.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:33:12
I do.  Buy I'm not telling.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:55:49
If you got your head off Ver's dick for a minute then maybe you could see more clearly.
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:11:19
Ooooh man that's so cool.  You figured it out.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:36:07
Too late.. I already hacked all the bitcoinz!

The dood has no life outside posting garbage.  Really kind of sad.
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:59:55
I would support removing your retarded post.  It's trash.  You gotta see that.  If not get help.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:41:15

You get an upvote, you get an upvote, EVERYBODY GETS AN UPVOTE!!1!one!!11!
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:55:36
Everything's a gamble.  The good thing is that your btc won't just 'go up in a puff of smoke' unless you panic sell or do something dumb with them.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:30:59
What is dead may never die.
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:16:01
Because maybe it's shit from top to bottom so how could there be a positive post on it?  Seems most likely.
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:05:18
It's over zero... It's not 'like completely totally not.'
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:34:09
Nothing like being a drama queen to keep people talking about your product.  I see through this bullshit very clearly.  It turns me off.  I don't care what they think about anything.  Just give us a wallet that works.  I've gone full Copay for a while now anyway.
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:19:31
Got it all figured out do you?  Why exactly is less dev control a good thing?  Is that all devs or just certain ones?  What makes those devs not worthy in your eyes?  Who does the control go to, and why?
You ain't got shit figured out, brah.
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:43:30
No... You won't.
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:03:21
Call me when there's a proper $10k/btc bubble.  ;)
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:14:51
No shit?  You see this 'logical path'?  That has about a 0% chance of happening.
How does anyone stop you from sending Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-06 09:58:46
If there was only some way... any way... that a vendor could accept bitcoin payment without the volatility risk.  Like a bitcoin payment processor of some kind... if only they existed.
You took time to post, but you clearly don't understand what you're doing here.
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:52:56
Lets see shall we?   Bitcoin started at ZERO and as I type this it's 887 on GDAX.  That's the only timeframe that matters. You latecomers can be so salty.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:56:35
Shhhh... don't feed that asshat.  He's sitting there beating off to your reply!
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:32:02
If not for you nobody would realize this.  Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:19:17
Sad for you maybe.  It's all about the price, man.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:30:06
Buy all you can get your hands on when it hits $1,000!
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:02:52
How many nodes does it take to make it decentralized?  With an answer to that we can continue to rip apart your random thoughts.
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:13:47
Yes. No.

Only $1 trillion?  pffft.

Awww poor baby can't handle the ride.
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:49:17
Get out of ShitThereum.  That's the best thing you could do.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:46:15
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:53:02
I'm up to -120 on you!  I can do better!!!!  byaaah!
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:57:25
Lot of words.  Mostly shit... But nice word count.  I think you can do better.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:32:19
But this isn't about the poor people.  I feel bad for them, but Bitcoin probably isn't for them right now.
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:25:43
I don't believe you.  And even if you did... Bye bye.  Lol
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:27:41
Can confirm... It's for us lazy people on the 2nd floor as well.  Can any of you lazy fucks that dwell above the 2nd floor confirm it's the same for you?
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:42:29
Bitcoin IS the leader.  Everything else is pure fantasy.  Get a grip brah.
@_date: 2016-11-15 22:59:13
Yes it is.  Nobody said it was the final solution.  If you don't know what you're talking about... stop talking.
@_date: 2016-11-13 09:13:52
Not really.
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:23:23
You make it sound like they wouldn't have been funded without him.  There would have been someone else.  Too bad there wasn't.
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:02:59
lol.. just relax into it.  You'll get there.  ;)
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:37:41
Exactly... they're providing a valuable service, not running a charity.  Whining about fees when you know what they are is retarded.
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:59:22
You're not going to be gentlemen with us and hodl till Satoshi shows us the way? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:28:13
No, we're absolutely NOT in a bubble.  Not even close.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:49:01
Since they're basically nothing now... I'm going to say there would be no fucking impact in the price.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:53:20
What's sad is you not understanding what you're dealing with.  I've been able to use BTC just fine.  Newsflash big guy... there is no one tool that does it all.  No time for this stupid shit.  Good luck. lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:44:22
Hodl and buy any nice dips along the way.  Anything else is silly.
Bcash?  I hope you lose all of your money.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:30:50
Some people are retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:30:13
BCH?  LOL
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:24:58
I never sell but I do buy dips on occasion.  Always works!
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:31:23
Nothing is going on other than you freaking out for no fucking reason.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:33:25
No.  Shitcoins and those that support them can fuck off.

@_date: 2017-11-05 11:32:33
Nobody cares about that shitcoin.  They can't do anything except lose money long term.  Have fun with that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:09:54
Ok.  Good story.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:54:51
$20 is pretty good for bigger transactions.  Let them waste their money I guess.
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:38:31
It is the only REAL option.
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:26:15
Terrifying, really?  Are you a drama queen in real life as well, or just play one on Reddit?
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:51:16
Buuuuuullllll shiiiiiiit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:52:53
Keep doing good things Bruce!  :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:20:33
Once they take BTC to $100k+ I'm sure volatility won't be an issue.  ;)
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:59:25
No he's not right.  You're both drama queens with nothing better to do apparently.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:13:21
So basically like what we have now... just with faster transfers?  No thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:00:48
Could the world end tomorrow?  It's possible.  But probably won't.

He can stay or leave, I don't care.  /ignore solves the problem for me.  ;)
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:16:28
I agree. Lets not destroy asics just yet.  If it ends up being needed then I'm ok with it.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:03:26
It does?  Why?
@_date: 2016-02-13 13:04:07
Because downloading a game, and confirmations on the bitcoin network are the same thing.  Right?  Unless you were trying to be sarcastic in some way... You need to learn a lot more about btc.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:50:32
It won't.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:21:19
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:55:22
Do some research.  Fuck.
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:00:49
Later then.  I realize there are people that have a hard time grasping some things.  I didn't think it was that difficult.  Although I put in a little something called effort to learn.  It's amazing how quick people bitch when they have to fire up some brain cells.  lol
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:52:37
BU is trash.  It isn't even in the same universe as Core.  Fuck you for even suggesting it is.

@_date: 2015-07-26 10:19:10
In other news... People in bars are mostly drunk idiots.  Thanks for the confirmation op.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:53:06
Who's 'we'?  Who would 'we' be talking about specifically?
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:01:03
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:28:15
Before I saw your post I was thinking something similar.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:03:23


@_date: 2017-04-08 01:54:51
It's going to happen.  Deal with it, brah.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:47:08
He does that all by himself.  Lol
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:11:44
But what if it was/wasn't?!
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:49:53
I agree... lets gather everyone into one room.  Maybe it'll turn out like an episode of Game of Thrones.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:07:12
Enjoyed the interview!  Good guy that Anton.
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:51:40
Sure is.  Although I would never sell a single satoshi for any price listed on an exchange.  Maybe they'll catch up someday.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:31:17
If he's competent he should know.  Since he's spouting dumb shit he should be treated like one.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:20:01
Not sure if you can do it but I hope you do.  Good luck!  :)
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:10:20

Hur Hur ya!
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:28:51
Calling bitcoin.com an 'information site' is VERY generous. ;)  They should have negative weight.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:02:05
Altcoins are mostly shitcoins.  The blocksize issue will be resolved.  It's your post that's the 'epic fail'.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:36:22
Sure you can find corn in shit... but you still shouldn't eat it.
Yes you can find good information there... but if you're new it's best to stay clear of it.  Unless you like digging around in shit for corn?  :)
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:40:40
Yes.  It excites me every day, and has for the past 5 years.

@_date: 2017-04-26 16:47:48
It's up to you.  You can hodl, sell, or trade.  I prefer hodling.  I never 'sell'.  I do buy shit and replenish though.
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:07:37
It still is.  You don't have to pay attention to the internet trash.  Would you in the "real world"?  Ain't nobody got time for that!
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:41:39
Are you saying advances stop with Moore's Law?
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:30:50
That's crazy shit.  Get this guys, it can be answered with the word 'yes' as well.  WOW!
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:25:07
No.  Not an inch.
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:00:56
Nice summary.  :)
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:08:53
Love it!
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:44:06
I understood him just fine.  On a scale of 1-10, how drunk are you right now?
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:43:28
The network is stuck?  That's odd, it seems to be working for me.
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:13:35
Or not be a fuckstick and learn how to send a proper fee.  Nah it's easier to bitch about it like the other idiots I guess.
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:41:18
I'll never forgive or forget.
@_date: 2016-02-13 13:06:39
Trash article.
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:32:14
He's a sad scammy ass-clown.
@_date: 2017-04-12 00:55:19
No it won't.  It'll be Bitcoin and a new shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:19:29
I've never thought that.  Been in this shit for a long time.  I sustain myself from the tears of noob traders.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:24:57
lol fuck man.  Political and social takeover?  You mean Princess Jihan and Roger?  That clearly failed brah.  There is no takeover.  Bitcoin is pretty fucking resilient... you would know that if you had been paying even the slightest bit of attention.

"religious claims"
His noodliness, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is the ultimate truth in the universe, and he says they have no use or value.  Who are you to disagree?

Huh?  The statement is only words, nobody did shit with their btc.  Soooo.....

Progress won't stop.  Just like the several other paradigms before Moore's Law.  If you can't think past that, then I guess you'd see a problem.  However, there really isn't one.

@_date: 2016-02-22 16:44:44
I guess we'll see about that.  Since there is nothing even close to bitcoin, you must be living in some alt-shit-coin dream land.  Good luck with that.

" If they get that, they're content leaving Core in control of the repo."
I don't care if they're content.  They don't get to decide what happens.  Only if they want to stay in business.  Not to mention they have ZERO control over the BTC repo.

No, we don't need to 'throw transaction volume on the chain'.  We don't need to buy goods and services with it.  It's nice that we can but I could care less if that increases.  I won't be doing it.  Why would I spend my BTC when I can spend shit paper fiat?  Get real.  They're going to have to offer one hell of a discount.
**Yes, idiots... I could care less.  I stand by my words.  Not saying I will, but I could.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:38:51

I care deeply about both of those things actually.  As I bet most of us do.  So fuck off with your drama.  k?
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:46:06
He really turned into a clowny ass-pirate.  He's such a clueless tool it's embarrassing.  I used to laugh... now I cringe.
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:39:45
You probably have a hard time understanding most things. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:18:33
Oh man, not recommending it to friends?  It's more than probable that your friends wouldn't care anyway.  You seem to have a difficult time with bitcoin.  It would be better if you didn't talk about it at all, and worked on becoming more informed.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:48:04
A btc will be worth a btc.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:12:20
Just another shitcoin.  It'll have more use than shithereum so I guess there's that.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:43:13
I question your googling skills.  ;)
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:40:42
Thanks for verifying statoshi. Did they just toss up the site today?  Seems like something that should have already been done.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:59:26
That would still be amazing!  I'll get worried around $100.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:55:04
How about they make a TokenMarketCap site?  A token is worse than a shit-coin.
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:04:23
No.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:37:23
Blah blah blah blah... Nonsense.  It's happening.  I am anti you.
@_date: 2017-07-08 10:17:23
That's exactly why he believes a HF will actually work.  lol
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:15:28
BTC it isn't a website.  More comparable to gold.  That seems to be working out just fine.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:06:48
The cRipple club is out in force I see.  lol
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:40:14
Just words thrown together in a post.  That's all I see there clueless one.  Did you even think about what you were typing? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:02:10
You mean the Core devs that were invited and uninvited then invited and uninvited again?  Those devs?  Those guys?  Them?  Ok.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:42:52
Were they whitey tighties with full racing stripe?!
The world demands to know!  ;)

@_date: 2015-10-13 21:06:11
It's not Ripple.  Just guessing.  Does there need to be another reason?
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:04:32
Is shite kinda like olde, or shoppe?  That's the most interesting part of your post.  The rest is shit.... or should I say shite.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:15:33
BU should split and create their own shit-coin.  Totally agree.  But they won't because it's so shitty even a true shit-coin is better.
@_date: 2016-05-25 12:01:46
But you would be wrong.  Just because you missed out doesn't make it true.  It was released to everyone at the same time.
@_date: 2016-05-27 09:29:36
You tell them a version of reality that keeps the money flowing.  That's what you do.  They don't need to know.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:52:27
Do things like what?  Work on them?  ok. lol
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:27:48
It's exactly the right time to feel bullish about bitcoin.  Every moment it exists reinforces that feeling for me.
If you want to cry about what you perceive as negatives, go ahead.  Bitcoin doesn't give a shit... and either do I.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:19:24
None of that is a problem with bitcoin.
Surely you can see that.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:15:21
Nonsense.  All of it.  You're either balls deep on Roger or you're a moron.  Which is it?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:38:38
Not at all.  Back then they claimed nodes mattered.  Now their talk has changed.  They are behind the AWS nodes in all instances.  You're the one being delusional here, bro.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:41:45
Bitcoin controls the music.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:42:56
You're close... it's zero.  ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:52:25
Selling?  I don't know what that word means.  ;)
@_date: 2017-07-11 09:39:27
There won't be a fork.  This is all a shit-screen.  Rise above the shit.

Feeling good and rested for another shit-tastic day of asshattery?
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:51:07
I'm pro BIP148, but I'm fine with nothing changing.  My 2 favorite options.
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:45:20
None of this concerns me.  Good story though bro.  lol
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:48:35
Exactly.  I'm not easily distracted, and thankfully there are many others out there that aren't as well.  
Filter out the noise, and remember what we're doing.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:21:13
Oh he's not pretending to be stupid.  Just is.

The battle never ends.  Use this time to sharpen your swords!!
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:40:03
Or you know.. people that like proof something actually happened.  Truth and reality... only a statist shill would want that! /s 
Now fuck off.  I got work to do.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:28:56
Either hodl it or sell now and leave while you still have something.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:10:00
So many comments... Lots of words... And mostly garbage.  Starting with the the OP.  Lol
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:26:34
I love upward stability!!!  I'll "priase stability" when we get to $100k/btc.  ;)
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:56:56
You don't get how this works.  That's ok.  Most people are as dumb as you.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:07:44


Oh really?  Tell us more.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:13:08
Why ruin a good thing?!
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:58:04
When it 'goes to the moon', I won't need any more btc.
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:21:22
They tried?  What did they do exactly?  I recall a lot of talk, but no action.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:08:24
You got it.  Good luck with any future HF.  UASF got us SetWit.  That's a fact Jack.  Deal with it or not.  I don't give a damn.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:24:28
Nope.  Segwit is the compromise.  Otherwise I'm VERY happy with the way it is now.  I don't mind it not changing.
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:57:35
You mean the guy that bid and won bitcoin, and unless he's distributed it, still has that same amount?  That Tim Draper?  Is it relevant how many fed notes it took to acquire them?  
So they're currently worth fewer magical fed notes, and when I think about what money is, it's like saying he'd get less 'WoW gold' if he sold them.
I use USD because I currently have to.  My full trust and confidence is with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-01 10:29:17
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:59:48
Or be sure to say you lost it all somehow.  I lost all of my btc years ago.  Sent to the wrong address.  Silly me.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:45:24
Nah we're not going to stop with the UASF 'bullshit'.  Actually I just started running a UASF/BIP148 node.  Not just signaling with a comment.  The clock is ticking.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:52:50
It's only exciting when the first number changes!
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:01:15
Has anyone noticed that ViaBTC is irrelevant?
"Yeah, just ViaBTC exchange right now, next to no volume though,"
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:39:43
Try to understand this.
It isn't being stepped on by anything.
It was never alive.
Sure, moon landing complete.  You can stay there if you want.  Bitcoin is headed interstellar.
@_date: 2016-05-28 09:55:14
No. It doesn't.
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:33:03
POW change.  Now who does?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:32:09
Only for online orders then?  Don't bother in store unless you want to accept 0-conf payments.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:51:33
A story you tell to kids.  A fairytale.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:19:45
Oh look, the shithawk is out already this morning.  Rested and ready to go today scrote?  lol
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:36:39
Ok I thought about it.  Now where's that tinfoil?  ;)
@_date: 2015-10-10 16:48:28
I think he's guzzling more than kool aid.  Old cumchugger there needs to get his head straight and rethink things.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:44:15
I'm the biggest anti-theist I know but even I respect Luke for what he has done and is doing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:40:36
Nah... he's can't be that smart. old Scrotes McFucklick is a fucking fail troll.  He tries though!  Keep er going scrotes!  lol
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:07:02
I guess they want their members delusional and easily controlled?
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:05:45
So this has nothing to do with bitcoin?  Wrong fucking sub/r then hey bud?
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:38:31


Really?  Fuck guys bitcoin is tulips!!  /sigh
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:55:59
Wrong.  It is exactly that.  Just another shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:36:56
We'll have segwit pretty soon.  Filter out the noise.
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:11:08
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:41:57
Why?  There's no reason to own a shitcoin unless you think you can dump it on a greater fool than yourself.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:58:16
There is only hodling.  I'll buy any dips that happen along the way.
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:08:40
'Proves' it hey?  Aaaaaand we're done.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:54:51
I had a nearly forgotten account with EA and a couple months ago someone tried purchasing several games.  The transactions were stopped thankfully, but wouldn't have happened in the first place if they accepted bitcoin.  Not to mention I had to waste time out my night investigating wtf was going on and why I was getting alerts.
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:59:10
And an asteroid might hit the earth making this all pointless.
Oh look I can do it toooooo!!!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:43:59
Welcome back!
@_date: 2015-03-27 10:20:43
Oh look another asshat complaining about other people complaining.  Fuck off kid!  Mommy didn't love you enough or something?
@_date: 2015-10-31 13:30:55
I hope they try to manipulate it through buying.  I'm ok with that.  ;)
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:13:30
Other than a lot of happy people?  It really wouldn't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:51:21
Keep telling that to yourself if it helps you sleep at night.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:37:48


lol... trust in XRP.  LOL
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:33:07
No it's actually a great idea.  I fully support it.  Get that code merged boys!!
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:06:46
... or did it become possible to pay craft beer for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:30:12
I needed a good laugh this morning.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:12:25
I'm 100% certain you're an idiot.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:03:43


So you don't know what a bitcoin is, but you're familiar with the term shitcoins?  Bullshit.  You done went full CJW on us brah.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:29:00
I'd be more shocked to see someone that honestly doesn't know, and isn't just trolling.  With a username like 247CryptoNews, I expected better, but at the same time it's very fitting.  ;)
@_date: 2015-02-12 13:18:32
Stop the sale?  Sure.  Stop a bitcoin transaction?  No.  Not even once.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:34:25
He corrected that... He meant that he'll eat Jihan's dick.  But he does that a lot now so not sure what the big deal is really.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:10:37
lol... 200x.  That's cute.  
You should sell while you can.  How's that  going for you?
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:34:01
I'm not seeing it, but ok.  I accept the award!
@_date: 2015-10-10 10:20:06
Your tinfoil must need reapplication.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:05:24

Wow I think we know where this goes guys.  /s
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:06:08
You realize the difference, right?  One is physical... the other not so much.  If you do it right nobody should be able to take your BTC unless you allow it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:36:32
Damn... is there no place you don't dump your trash scrotes?  He is on fire already today! lol.  Keep up the shit-tacular work there shithawk!
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:17:13
~66% the rest was getting lucky with shares I started buying in 2008.  It would be 100% without that.  :)

@_date: 2015-02-12 13:21:19
No.  The people have spoken bud.  We're going with this plan!
@_date: 2015-10-24 17:42:41
With bitcoin it wouldn't get stolen in the first place.  I've securely stored, and used, quite a few bitcoin over the past 5 years.  Not once have I had any stolen.  It's really not that hard to keep them safe if you try... and you should.. it's your fucking money!
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:59:25
That's a bit much.  I've gotten them for $30 each plus $10 shipping.  Check out Sidehack's post on Bitcointalk.

Think of it as unicorns fucking.  Makes just as much sense.
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:04:00
Do you believe everything you read?  I'd suggest to keep reading more, and not all from one place.
@_date: 2016-07-04 09:32:10
That's exactly how I'd describe this thread OP.  Nicely done.
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:17:43
Where have you been?  Ethtards have been beating that dead horse for a while now.  Comparing the 2 would only show everyone how much you don't know.  Nice try though.  2/10
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:32:25
I agree with you. The missing component is critical thought. Ignorance is ugly.

No, it's really not false.  Thanks for trying though.
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:37:35
You mad brah?  You need to keep calm and let the liquor do the thinkin... because you aren't.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:59:47
That's sad to hear.  I didn't find them that hard to set up.  It's probably for the best.  Frees him up to work on the other miner projects he has going!

Sorry to break the news to you... but bitcoin wasn't premined.  Get your facts straight at least.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:14:11
I think they mean they accept bitcoin, and now some shitty alts.
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:54:38
Piss off with your shit-post.  We're all VERY aware that there ARE solutions being worked on that will be deployed in the not too distant future.  However, mrdotkom is correct.  If the blocksize doesn't change, then there isn't really an issue.  Storage is cheap.
Are you just typing words to make yourself feel better?  Does it make you feel like you're doing something good in the world, while not doing a god damn thing?  You probably post about the environment the same way.  All talk, no walk.  STFU!

@_date: 2016-07-14 23:26:58
There is no problem except that people are afraid of China for some reason, and don't really understand how Bitcoin works.
There are days where I wish the mother-ship would hurry up and come get me already!  I'm phoning home ma'fakas!  ;)

I &lt;3 all you crazy bastards in r/bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:22:59
lol... man you either don't know shit about bitcoin, or you don't mind telling lies.  Which is it?  Either way you should just STFU.
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:41:55
So insightful.  How about you provide an example of where he said something else?  Oooh ya... who needs evidence, right?
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:59:19
I came here for a crash, and all I found was a dip.  Good story brah.
@_date: 2016-07-24 10:44:29


So you're saying that there's no way to 'bolt' on more privacy to bitcoin?  I don't believe you.  I also don't think it'll be more challenging than what we've been dealing with.  They just can't do everything at once.
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:34:33
No.  Just religitards, religitarding.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:55:43
Nah... even if bitcoin wouldn't work out for some reason.  There are plenty of other much larger groups of fools out there.  Look no further than any flavor of religion for example.  lol

The one think I learned here.... the OP doesn't know how to take a picture.
@_date: 2016-07-28 09:45:10
The increase isn't immediate.  They have 5 years.

1. All of them. All your Nobel Prizes are belong to Satoshi!
2. Gavin
3. Moon?
4. Buy btc off an exchange and send it to a btc eater address!
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:19:38
I'd send my magic dragons to 'fix' the situation.  Done.
@_date: 2016-07-29 01:52:43
Overpriced?  Do you know of another similar option?  I think $50 is worth it.  Might not be for everyone.  Waiting on my second one to be shipped!  Any day now.  :)
@_date: 2016-07-22 02:16:53
I know this might sound crazy, but people actually look at multiple sources for information.   They don't just come here.  I come here for specific information.  Are you capable of understanding that?
@_date: 2016-07-22 16:20:15
"There’s a five-year transition period..."
Not that interesting.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:13:45
Yes it is.  All of this shit is about stalling and doing nothing.  Well that time is over.

I'm sure there's a Trump rally somewhere that you should be attending.

Ahhhh... you mean all of it?  ;)

I'm not sure it's an act.
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:52:46
Too bad that isn't happening anywhere else besides your mind.  Nobody is buying anything form McDonalds with btc.  And 2% on $5?   He's gotta be kidding.  Ya that's a real show stopper there.
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:42:53


Yes there is.  It's "halvening".
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:39:31
Man those are some weak ass comparisons.  Not at all close.  ShitThereum is a scam and enables more scams to be built with it.  It's a scam generating machine.  Great use case.

Why do people say this?  It's retarded.  'Anything' is not possible.

Sure this is the top... until the next one.

"I don't see anything in any of that even mentioning Bitcoin..."
Other than where it specifically mentions bitcoin?  Then you're right, it's not there.  ;)
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:03:23
If that's what you want it to be.
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:41:12
It will not allow some people to run full nodes.  Leading to a bit more centralization.  Not acceptable IMO.
Never run s2x... it's only for some miners.  I'm never accepting their shitty code.  We'll get segwit so they can go fork themselves after that!
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:43:52
That's the idea.  That's how we get to 10k and beyond.  Traders trading.
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:08:28
So what?
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:35:12
I just received my first cryptosteel yesterday, and I love it!  I recently placed an order for one more.  I had no issues, other than all the letter and number tabs were spilling out of the packaging, but contained within the main envelope thankfully.  It took a little more digging around to find the letters I needed, but that's about the only negative thing I can say.
Thank you for the very nice product!  I sleep very well at night knowing I have a Trezor and Cryptosteel!  :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:22:02
Sorry man.  She's probably not going to get 'more cool'.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:40:40
Wrong.  There is only one BTC.   can piss off with his shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:48:57
All of the miners?  All of them? All?  ?  I can't believe people are taking the time to argue with this... whatever the fuck it is.  A retarded AI perhaps?
@_date: 2016-07-20 12:18:05
It's clear that you either never had, or have lost your grip on reality.  Keep drinking that Kool-Aid brah.  People like you are the real danger to society.
@_date: 2016-07-20 10:18:44
Circle is the only place I buy btc now.  Conbase account closed, I can't support that company.  Since they're not denying you just for fun, there has to be more to the story.  I see a 'red flag', but it isn't on Circle.
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:41:01
The entire China 'concern' is a little crazy.  There's nothing keeping anyone else from mining.  Get to it, or go back to your Trump rally.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:18:10
Maybe if I pissed gasoline I would.
@_date: 2016-07-28 09:52:15
No, it's not.  Are you even trying?  .5/10
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:42:56
You're really a special kind of idiot.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:05:45
How long for the first confirmation?  Don't care about the other ones.  Or the first one really.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:11:47
I was wondering why I had you tagged as 'Moron'.  Thanks for the reminder.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:09:50
I understand that feeling.  For me it faded the more I used bitcoin.  I haven't worried about moving around btc for a long time.  Just make sure the receiving address is correct, the fee is appropriate, and trust the system.  :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:06:13
Developers competent enough aren't easy to come by.  Nobody compares to the devs that contribute to BitcoinCore.  You're right the market will follow.  They'll follow the talent.  Your 'it is decentralization' shit is laughable.  You don't add shitty code and developers to the mix and make a cake.  You leave the shit out.  See how it works?
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:17:13

Damn you're sounding mighty salty these days.  I'm sure Doge has seen gains just like that as well.  Lol.  Keep pumping those shit-coins bro!  Whatever makes money, right?

Some miners can continue to lick my taint and will NEVER have my respect.  Some are ok.  None will bowed down to.  WE pay THEM.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:46:01
Lol... I don't tip and I have no problem paying $1-$10 for a transaction.  Oh well.
@_date: 2016-07-11 09:55:14
It's a scam coin.  More so than most of the other alts.
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:59:37
Your posting history says otherwise.

There isn't going to be a HF.  But keep telling yourself there will be.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:28:49
Very sad.  I hope if people are able to infiltrate and disrupt they do so.  
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:50:32
You're delusional.  That steeming pile of garbage you seem so sure is the next best thing to sliced bread, won't even be remembered in a few months... if it's lucky.  The first dump, or 'hack' will be the last we seriously hear from it.  Good luck with your shit-coin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:51:28
Why don't you just worry about yourself, and let the rest of the 'thinking people' handle their own?
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:19:38
Agree.  I did a couple years ago... On Coinbase.  Lol
The only good thing I'll ever say about Chase.

Fuck you figured it out!  Idiot.

This whole coal mining push is insane.  Next up:  horse and buggies!
@_date: 2016-07-05 19:10:30
We can either continue building great things, or crawl in bed and wait for darkness.  You should learn more about btc before making such silly statements.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:09:46
They're not taking over anything by doing this.  If anything it pushes a HF down the road several months.  But we'll already have Segwit and LN so does it matter?  I say no.  It does not.
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:50:57
Who said the purpose of bitcoin was to have merchants accept it?  It's going to thrive exactly because of the reasons you fear will kill it.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:21:32
I just got the first one I ordered.  It took about 20 days to get to me, but it's exactly as advertised.  I love it!  Placed another order recently.  I expect that to take a lot longer due to the back order.  For me it's worth the wait.
@_date: 2016-07-22 19:31:10
Find another place to get btc.  I'm very happy with Circle.  At the very lease, ditch  and move on to something else.  They're a  company now.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:31:21
Then you're a fucking idiot.

@_date: 2013-12-06 11:54:43
I purchased some btc on their app before and it submitted the order twice.  One went through and the other overdrew my account by a little bit.  They never charged my card and just canceled the order.  I'm not sure what the reason for linking the card is if they don't use it.
