Hey bud, I think hes just saying your best bet is to assume you will get zero bitcoin back. He does have some solid points... all fiat debt will be paid back before a single bitcoin is sent to any 'customer'

There are plenty of ways of not being conscripted, go to college, pay out of it, ect. There are plenty of countries with a draft and the majority of people do not "flee" the country. As far as women not being draft, I agree. Equality means equality.

The jump would have been fun it was cushened by a nice pile of money.  But in all seriousness there is nothing inherently wrong with speculative investment vehicles or debt-based spending. For the record the majority of the places that received bailouts have repaid them with interest which has gone toward the government budget ( I can promise you that without it you and your family would have suffered far more than me or anyone I work with. Also, just about none of them where hedge funds. Its fun to point fingers at banks and wall street but why can't everyone take responsibility for their actions? This is a democracy, I didn't hear the majority of Americans complaining when people on a 50k yearly salary were able to get 20k credit card limits and 500k mortgages. Oh did the banks hold a gun to their head to sink themselves further into debt? No. Were they too fucking stupid to understand the disadvantage of an interest only mortgage, well thats not my fucking problem. 
Again, money is not evil, I do not hold a gun to peoples head, steal, lie or cheat. I am able to create money in a way that most people are not able to comprehend, as I see you are unable too, additionally i use the money for good. Your self rightousness is absurd. 
Just to rub salt in the wound because you have been such a dick just wanted to let you know the 2008 crisis did not really hurt any of us. I can tell you I know a lot of hedge fund managers that cried; they only received 45 million that year instead of the expected 80 :(

Explain to me why the hell the landlord would even bother? Maybe in this case if they have one apartment, fine. But in many situations this is not the case. When I was younger I would help my father with his real estate and I can tell you right now if he had to worry about transferring his rent payments into USABLE currency it would add at least 5 hours of work a month, maybe more. Do the tenants want to cover the costs of that also? As far payment fees believe it or not traditional banking actually has bitcoin BEAT in this situation. All tenants would pay rent with a check or direct ACH ($3 dollar fee also covered by tenant). This means the landlord receives direct usable USD without any problems, this also does not include the possibility that you are helping this tenant with tax fraud.

You can not get high on bitcoin (directly) or run an operating business solely via BTC... You really think if the  US government made all banks refuse (by law) BTC related fiat the price would not crash and burn? Hell wtf would you do with it? All major vendors that accept it trade it for fiat directly. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:36:14
Holy hell man you missed the point. You would not have business owners, new products, innovations or ANYTHING without the financial industry. How did coinbase and other BITCOIN start ups obtain funding? I have made all of my money without stealing, or hurting anyone. I pay all of my taxes, and I donate to plenty of charities. I can donate a few weeks salary to charity and simply dwarf your overall contribution. I understand that my pursuit of money is not for everyone but to shit on them is ridiculous. I have many friends who have other career choices and make much less than I do and some that make money, typically I do not discuss money with them. However they also do not believe they are inherently better because they make $30K a year working at a "friendly" company.
The simple fact that you truly believe you are "making the world a better place" is hilarious.

You should be the spokesperson for Bitcoin. HEY!! Come try our awesome new currency its so much better than banking! You just need to spend hours learning a new operating system, buy new hardware, add to infrastructure and teach all users new software! BUT YEA LOOK ITS SUPER EASY!

You missed the point 100%. Person 1 would need to PURCHASE 3m worth of BTC and then I would need to SELL 3m worth of BTC. Or say simply, I am paid in BTC, then what? I cannot run my business with BTC, I cannot pay my employees payroll, bills, ect. Attempting to sell that much BTC I will end up with 2million at best, if I don't drive the price to zero. Not to mention that 3 million is a very small sum for small/medium business transactions. Bitcoin in general has terribly liquidity, yes it may be "valued" at 8 Billion dollars, but there sure as hell isn't anywhere close to that much demand. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:16:28
What countries is insider BITCOIN trading considered a crime? China? US? Canada? Yes insider trading of STOCKS/BONDS/CURRENCY that are officially regulated is illegal. Additionally just saying, "LOOK THERE IS PROOF JUST LOOK" is not a valid reason to make fairly serious accusations. As far as raising the price.. I still do not understand the average bitcoin, it seems like you the majority of people took Ayn Rand and genetically crossed it with the far left.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:04:27
My point was simple, if US bans bitcoin. 1. price will drop ALOT, and will have a hard time recovering 2. Other countries may follow suit, which means a swift death. 3. Banning only in the US will drive bitcoin underground in the rest of the world, just like other items which are banned but you think flourished, ie. illegal drugs and currency exchange. Please stop having these delusions, if the US wanted to ban bitcoin they could very quickly and easily however 7.5 billion market cap is what they spend ok toilet paper in 12 hours so I don't think it matters. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:45:24
I am not sure where you are getting your information but I urge you to read up on the subject. The average time it takes for an experimental drug to make it past approval is about 12 years in the United States. Additionally only 1 in 5000 drugs will actually make it to market, the idea that most drugs do not make it to market due to not being profitable is laughable. From what I understand you are saying that drug companies spend BILLIONS of dollars on R&amp;D without a promise of profit BUT do not deserve a large payout? Why do you get you set the payout amount? I understand that people may die due to the choices they make but that is their choice to make, just like it was their choice to invest billions. If you do not like it you are more than welcome to start your own pharma company, invest billions of dollars, years of time and sell the newly developed drugs at a break even cost. Lets not forget the world experimented with the idea of "working just hard enough for the greater good of our society" and that idea failed and crumbled in the early 90s. A lot of these drugs are also sold at 10-100X mark up in the US/Canada/Europe to then be sold at MUCH smaller prices in the developing world.
Is this a perfect system? No. You are in a Bitcoin forum, the idea of free market should be pretty easy for you to understand.

Reading a "book" from the Ludwig von Mises Institute does not make you a free market genius. Not to mention its complete validity. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 01:54:26
Realistic by when? As much as I want to believe, even the current market cap is a bit misleading. No matter how many times you say bitcoin has a market cap of 10 billion, its liquidity is SHIT. Say you want to transfer a 3million USD via bitcoin, buying/selling that small of a volume will destroy most exchanges...

Do you know one of the reason philosophers make less than engineers/economics/mathematicians/homeless people? Philosophy is great as an "art" but pretty shitty when it comes to application. I have respect for the fact that you hold this opinion and I completely respect that you may truly believe in it. I have no respect in the ideology because I believe it to be simply bullshit. It has never and will never work with the human race as we know it.

You can get illegal drugs, and scheduled pharma narcotics. Potentially some other pills people like to take, which I may add is illegal. Have you tried getting avastin, sofosbuvir, folotyn? Anything that actually saves peoples lives? Are you really trying to tell me that in 4-5 years we will be using crypto currency to pay for doctors? Health care reform takes DECADES let alone currency and healthcare reform! Healthcare is a trillion(s) dollar a year business with central power. Bitcoin has a market cap of 7.5 billion in total world wide. I think you have been purchasing way to much "medication" from your bitcoin doctor. I think bitcoin is a great technology and hell it has made me good money, and provided a lot of enjoyment but lets try living realistically.

I bet that "good business relationship" is not FREE. The entire idea of this is fucking stupid. For a community that prides itself on being smart with regards to economics this is a fairly stupid argument. 
Fairly certain even if they get discounts it does not cover the cost of bribery. You do understand that corruption typically plays in favor of the politicians especially in this case.. They are paying to not be raided/put out of business..

That is incredibly childish and completely impossible. 
1. You sound much more jealous than angry
2. You do not understand how the finance sector/banks work
3. The "old" establishment will not "burn" to the ground EVER, if all of these new currencies "replace" banks/finance in a big way it will still be controlled by the same people. Let me explain this in a very simple way... What companies do you think will be on the forefront of green/renewable energy? ExxonMobile, Shell, Chevron. Why? Because once you have BILLIONS its much easier for you to adapt and build new infrastructure than someone starting from scratch.
4. The finance industry does not simply "fuck with everyone else' money while producing nothing but more money for themselves". Without banks it would be impossible for most people in the US to buy a house, cars, build a retirement fund. Most companies would not be able to barrow money to develop new technologies and products. 
5. Even IF certain jobs in the finance industry produce no direct economic impact, high paid individuals typically use that money to reinvest into the economy.
6. I love money. =)

The difference is very simple.. how long does it take for content to be on Netflix? 3-4 months after it is released elsewhere? (ignoring netflix original content). After an episode of a TV show airs on cable it will take up to 6+ month to make it to netflix. Some people don't care, sure but the providers of the content care, they want to maximize how much they cash out! That means new content == high cost to both YOU and the company paying to distribute it. The idea if very simple, the hardware is already there, hell I do this with an HD Homerun Prime and a MythTV server but this is a company selling it as a service, thus their product is the information they stream so someone will have to pay for the licenses. This can be compared to a lower cost cable package, which from all accounts $20 no strings attached is amazing.

It's a joke. As much as I enjoy my server running all you have mentioned I would guess most of the shows you watch are "American television". As much as I love watching BBC documentaries I would guess it's not all you watch.
