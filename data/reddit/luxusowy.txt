Okay, I see. Thank you, I guess I have no more questions :)

Oh, now it makes sense, I forgot to add GHS as something valuable. Now  it is right.
Still sounds like something risky and too sophisticated for me to make profit on that, thanks for explanation though.
Could you additionally tell me why you are stating that GHS will likely lose value over time?

Thank you for your assessment, I just hope that in real life you're as courageous as in the interwebz - if so - maybe one day you'd be taught a lesson of respect for others - I wish you would :)

Stop reading then, I've never stated it is my mother tounge, Mr. Perfect :)
I just hope it is clear enough for you to feel offended - if it is - I'm okay with it.

I don't mean to be rude, but you must be naive if you think 7 months is not enough to make a progress (given the fact, that at the beginning of writing I was truly beginner).
Also, in my first post, I've never asked for correcting my mistakes, but for ideas - some people were nice enough to point out some biggest flaws, which I have corrected - but I haven't asked to literally go through and act as revisor. Thesis is already written, but your reaction made me totally unwilling to share it with any community, guess I'll keep it just for me and my university.

Uruguay. Come on, at least spell it correctly.

There is no such a thing like "free healthcare" or "free education", come on.

That's funny how I can relate your answer to your input to this conversation.
eot pls, waste of my precious time
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:40:10
Thank you for your concern, I really appreciate it, but it is already done, if you haven't read my previous posts.
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:40:37
I am glad that your greatest achievement is being born in English-speaking country, I guess being proud of it might be only compared to being proud of being white - same level of simplicity of the mind ;-)
Also: keeping your only argument the one about the language - boooring - but what can I expect from 'murican :)

Given the fact that you're Reddit mod, I'm sad about what Reddit has become.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:46:23
Well, I can see I expected too much while using irony, sorry.
Also, lack of knowledge about word "douche" - damn, where have you been hiding for last hundred of years?
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:10:28
Currently I noticed that not all Bitcoin users are as fine as those on frontpage - I'm just fascinated how you found out that I am clueless, if you're some kind of magical mind-reader I strongly insist on contacting some NSA - they might be interested in cooperating with such douche telepath ;-)

So accordingly to calculator on their websites and my calculations, am I correct saying, that it would mine less BTC than I invest? Calculations explained in my post above.
However fluctuating price is tempting, yet I perceive it as a good way for people who are already involved, not for newcomers.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:03:55
So I might be right? Thank you for confirmation :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:21:26
Here you go!
I'd just like to notice, that it is literally NOT ready. And already over-amibtious if you compare it to other students' topics/works (bachelor thesis is treated more like test, if we are able to write anything scientific, rather than being scientific itself).
All suggestions appreciated, that means criticism too :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:43:31
Thank you for those, I have to admit i haven't literally googled for thesis(es? what's the plurar...). I will have to take a look on those, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:54:50
Thank you for that. Quite simple, but I guess there is no better tool at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:14:33
You're correct sir, at the time I was writing the names of the chapters I was still a newbie to the topic, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:13:27
Thank you for your opinions and for some new references I would later check out. I'm currently correcting all the mistakes you guys point out - thank you for that, as probably you're the only ones, who would spot them, as none of "my" people would be Bitcoin-educated enough to see them :) Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:09:37
Thank you, I'll keep that in mind while rewriting my thesis and correcting mistakes (I guess there are many). About citations - don't worry, I have like half of them, since at the beginning I was like "whew, I'll add citations later" - and now I regret it, double-work to find every source again.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:08:24
Thank you for many suggestions, I really appreciate your ideas (actually this post probably would help me more, than my teacher past last few months). The problem with some of them is that I basically study economics, so I have to stick to economy-related topics in my thesis - that's why I'm afraid you won't find a lot info about eg. cryptography, mining hardware etc - as mostly I want to focus on Bitcoins and its economy itself.
Another problem is that (and you might won't believe it) - thesis isn't supposed to be too long. Now it's only partially done and it's already around 20 pages (well, let's not talk about quality right now) - and I'm aiming into 35-40 maximum. 
But thank you anyway, I will keep that post to inspire me for new paragraphs and chapters, I appreciate it! :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:36:07
Probably not, once I had two thesis about Bitcoin, but I must have lost them somehow, as I can't find hyperlink to them, still searching though.
Nevermind, I found it, yep, I've seen it, very interesting, but some aspects are well, above level of my skills and knowledge (and above level of my thesis aswell) - but I keep my eye on it ;)
