whatever fees such a limited block size limits the number of transaction to a very small market

Ive made an observation... anyone who thinks the best purpose of the blockchain is for anything other than the transfer of bitcoins ie value is either a troll or just doesnt get the killer ap is... MONEY

Its up to you the individual to establish realistic risk/reward, but to me introducing a third party into the equation without compensation beggers belief. Insurance thats another matter. 
Lets agree to disagree

Exactly!! to my mind there is no reason why smart contracts or anything else must be "built into" the coin. The bitcoin token (ledger) which is money, is just that... money. This digital money (bitcoin) can be used or applied by/to any other function. Other functions do not need to be integeral to the blockchain or coin and should not be.
Im the opposite to Jamie Dimon, forget the blockchain its Bitcoin that matters. The blockchain just enables Bitcoin to prevail.

You give your bitcoin or gold to someone else to look after, the BEST outcome... they give it back. The risk/reward ratio couldnt be worse.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:54:25
smaller blocks less transactions... simples

Hold the center of the graph right up to your nose. It should be blurry. Focus as though you are looking through the image into the distance.

The Kitco spread on billion is about 3% for ounce bars, not exactly a "ton of money" but yeah not for a day trader :)

if you plan on a big event you need a big venue. 1 meg blocks = a garden shed. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:15:42
I think we can all agree that would be most fair

why not both? im sure there will be solution to the transaction limits in time.

i suspect my elderly mother is satoshi she doesnt have the "stomach" to prove it or hire a pulicist but noone has ever disproven my theory. when i confronted her she pretended she didnt know what i was talking about, which is exactly what you would expect satoshi to say.

Do what Robert Kiyosaki would do, get a four year unsecured loan, work out how much you want it to cost per month. buy bitcoin a few dash and some eth just incase.
paper money isnt scarce why save something with unlimited supply?

1meg is the magic number where magic coders are prepared to help, but if you double that to 2meg that is an evil number where evil people will control Bitcoin?

The consensus in 1999 was a workable digital money was impossible, easy to poo poo the prediction with hindsight. For instance Gregory Maxwell was a skeptic.
"“When bitcoin first came out, I was on the cryptography mailing list. When it happened, I sort of laughed. Because I had already proven that decentralized consensus was impossible.” G Maxwell
