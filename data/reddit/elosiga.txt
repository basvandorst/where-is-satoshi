Expertise in computer science, coding, networks, cryptography, economics, banking, game theory, a new invention (blockchain), and the vision to put all this together for a specific noble purpose. Satoshi was/is a genius.

Doge is ideal for smaller transactions, which cost 1 doge or about 1/50th of one penny.
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:51:39
Seriously, I've heard of a few studies that have tried predicting Bitcoin's future price. They all seem to agree that Bitcoin will either implode or be worth a whole lot. How much? Well that depends on whether or not it will be used as a storage of value (such as gold). Figures vary by a lot, but it's not uncommon see quotes upwards of $50k or more. Just my two bits.

Excellent statement from the article: "The old system cracks apart as more of its flaws are revealed. The singular desire to dominate markets is eventually outweighed by the collective will to advance them. Wealth and opportunity become more evenly distributed throughout society. And unstoppable change emanates from the bottom up. "

Venezuelans who read this will think it's "mining" on a regular mine; the article doesn't explain what it is. It will only serve to gather attention and Barbara Streisand effect.

Chamo, this article is 7 months old. Granted, volume on surbitcoin.com and local bitcoins in Venezuela is rising exponentially.

Should also mention that a private blockchain is quite vulnerable and exposed to hackers who would love nothing better than to spam or launch a 51% attack. Fedcoin anyone ? Or how about Citi... Shiticoin ?

Dogecoin is the way to go. It's easy, low cost. You can download the light multi-bit wallet for all your students. Then you can have them exchange dogecoins or even earn them from you in exchange for good grades or performance. Transactions are fast, they only take a few minutes, plus the kids will love the shiba-inu dog mascot.

At 9:13 guy says, "Banks do the same thing. They accumulate small deposits from thousands of people and use that to make loans" - ha ha ha ! sure buddy. Banks don't use deposits to make loans.

It's a communist paradise !

We could have had Bitcoin by 2001 where SHA-256 (2001), POW (1997), and elliptical curve cryptography (1985) had already been invented; but it took the brilliant mind of Satoshi to put it all together.

Also, take a look at the [hash rate](
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:52:49
NO, banks give out bank credit (in the form of a loan) to the borrower, it's a promise to pay in exchange for the borrower's IOU. These loans to the borrower don't come out of deposits, they come out of the borrower's promise to pay back the principal + interest or else lose the collateral. Because loans are balanced across banks, ultimately there's just an exchange of promises. Banks don't need to access deposits to make loans because banks can lend as much as borrowers can borrow. In other words, banks can conjure up the money they loan out of thin air. Fractional reserve banking applies when a deposit is made at the bank, where the bank is required to hold a fraction of it in reserve. The bank can do with the excess reserves as it pleases, it can even lend them out. This gives the public the false impression that loans come out of deposits. And by the way, when you make a deposit, it's not your money anymore, it's the bank's.
