thx for the detailed reply. that really sucks. you don't prefer to just send them ID documents to see if they'll be willing to unlock your coins?

hi when I downloaded btcpp-qt-linux64, my linux-mint didn't know what to do with it. I tried to open it in Archive Manager but it says "Archive type not supported". there doesn't seem to be a way to extract it. any idea?
(sorry! I am new to linux)

hi Gio i know it's been 2 weeks since your account restored, But wondering what did they say was the reason they locked your account in the first place? Was it the TOR/VPN IP or too much money which triggered the system's red flag? 
any insights would be great. ty

sorry can you explain how this is possible for a layman? what are these signatures? i've set up cold storage electrum wallets on a permanently-offline laptop i dont want to mess this up ;_;

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:06:48
instructions are here for electrum 
i also found this useful when i was newbie (it's linked in the sidebar of this reddit)

hi i'm no expert but following advice from the larger threads you should not do any selling until there is 'some way' to verify that the coinbase's own replay protection code works the way it should (because there is no built-in replay protection on B2X coins). Directly after the fork, selling your segwit2x could incur the risk of a double-spend causing you to lose both your BTCs and your B2X's at the same time to the buyer! 
just don't do anything rash

can you explain the difference between your method and the one written in the docs by electrum.org? how would your method solve the danger of a copy of offline electrum that had been compromised? i mean this sincerely, i want to know. cause i already thought I had built my airgapped PC properly but apparently I might have screwed up following the instructions on their page?

hey fairly new here, this is the first time i've heard the argument that both 1x and 2x could *BOTH* die. 
you put it in the opinion section but can you extend that with some speculatory thought on the likelihood of that happening? I am a novice here but I do have some amount of money held as bitcoins and you make me worried sir!
