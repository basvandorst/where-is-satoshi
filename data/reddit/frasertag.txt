I do not own any btc, but follow it and have since my friends started purchasing in 2011... anyway
I understand a lot of people got burned by gox and feel very sorry for them all, If I personally could give them help I would, each and every one of you.
With that said, the offer of them repaying lost investments I can see why they think they might have a chance which is like leading the desperate to certain destruction. 
But you guys are not dumb, there is no more trust in this exchange, it fucked over a lot of people and if they want to repay with 50% of their profits then people need to use the service.
Thing I see happening is, simply no one uses them I mean why would you? The only people I see that would be willing to use the exchange would be people with vested interests in getting the money they are owed.  In which case it will fail and probably declare bankruptcy or it will take a really really long time for it to be trusted again.

Coming from Australia, Nascar looks like a bunch of people driving around in circles.. I  understand there is much more too it than that but people in Australia prefer watching cars race around this like Bathurst Mountain

I went to check out the bitcoin atm in the ACT yesterday.  
  
  
Im paraphrasing but on the screen it read something like  
  
  
**Welcome to the future of banking**  
**Buy bitcoins**  
**ATM out of order, please come back another time**

Love the help you people are giving. 
Kind of shocked at all the different ways to share bitcoin via that tip bot. I thought it was officially decided on bits? Could be confusing for a new comer

I literally purchased 3 BTC around a week before it started pumping, I think it was around $1100USD
When it hit $1800 USD I started selling, I then Sold some more at $1900USD, and have just recently sold at $2050USD
I only have one bitcoin left... I plan to Hold this one however... I am just so unsure of what I have done, 
I basically recovered my initial investment and still have 1.0 BTC, I feel like I should feel good about that however I just hope I didn't miss the BTC Fire Sale!

Did we every learn of what the Pizza shop did with the BTC they got for the Pizza?  Did they Hodl?  
  
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:36:17
Thanks for the reply, that is a little underwhelming haha...
Compared to the $20,000,000 it would be worth Currently...
Fair enough it being some person buying pizza with fiat for someone willing to pay BTC, I guess back then you couldn't buy shit with it.
I had some BTC back in 2009... lets not discus that though :(
