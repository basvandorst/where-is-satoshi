Simply outlawing something such as BTC would be enough to do serious damage.

1.)Bitcoins are worthless *because they aren't backed by anything.*  No cash flows, no ownership of real assets, no nothing.  In this sense, it's no better than a Dollar or a Euro.
2.)"Bitcoins are not untraceable.  They go right into this hex value right here..."  Yep, totally traceable, which is why *it's only a matter of time* before we find these Mt. Gox coins...
3.)"We'll never run out of bitcoins, because we can have 21,000,000x10^8 units."  Yep, better hurry and get them now before we, errr, run out?

Buddy, if there's one thing that's "perfectly on topic for our little sub-thread," it's your conflation of different issues in a ham-fisted fashion in an effort to get your point across by any means necessary.
I shouldn't have to repeat my comments.  This thread was about *international* banking.  My comments regarding 0.1% related to Americans engaged in *international* banking with this particular need (note, the *vast* majority of Americans have no problems with international banking whatsoever).
So you make some asinine, cheeky comment to the effect of "*The point is that currently 28.3% of Americans have already stopped using banks. And you are most likely in good company thinking that only 0.1% or less would be in that position. Nobody will blame you for coming to that conclusion*" knowing *full well* I didn't imply that *at all*.  
I deal with people of means all the time, and in many circles (including U.S. courts of law) I would be considered an "expert" in the subject of finance.  I would *not*, under *any* circumstance, recommend "trying out bitcoin" to an individual with a real international banking need.  Not only do I personally think it's a poor idea, but I would be failing that person in my *fiduciary* duty in putting them into a highly volatile, generally speculative instrument for the sole purpose of conducting a transaction.

That's too bad.  It pays pretty well.
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:48:56


This is it, and this is all you need to know.  BTC is a hobby.  The current BTC economy *largely* exists to help early adopters part with their holdings and convert to other currencies. 
The price is going down just as you said - no new demand for BTC while current holders are selling selling selling. Vendors turn around and sell as well, putting pressure on prices.
I can tell you that falling prices is not the stuff that dreams are made of.  You won't see vendors holding BTC after a transaction if they think that the value their money is going to decline 10% in the next month.  A gradual decline like this nearly always presages a much larger decline as prices reach mental "tipping points" and people say "that's it, this is as low as I'm letting it go; I'll get out now and come back in when it's lower."
All of these transactions you hear - bungalows in Bali, Lambos in Malibu, what have you - are not signs of a new BTC economy.  The're a sign that there are owners of property out there who will deal with your BTC on a short-term basis if it means making the sale.  Once you walk out the vendor's door, BTC goes straight to Dollars or Euros.
This sort of price action occurs with other securities all the time.  What else happens all the are really great explanations about why price declines are "OK" (the usually aren't OK at all and are generally a bad sign in almost every case).

I'm not even going to get into this Bitcoin price speculation.  You do what you need to do with that; you don't need to justify it with me.  I care only about Bitcoin as an economic construct.


They're *less valuable than that.*  Google shares are a legal claim on the equity of a business - a store of value, and a form of currency.  It has intrinsic value - at any point in time quite literally a floor value whose price cannot be economically denied.  It is itself a digital construct, whose supply is tightly controlled by shareholders.  It can be electronically transferred at zero cost *if we were inclined to do so* (this is key).  
Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, and property with no underlying value at best.  Its value is derived solely from the utility it provides to its users.  There is no price that Bitcoin by itself could ever trade at that would make it economically irresistable.

@_date: 2014-03-26 18:32:12
I can appreciate your comments.  As background, in my first job out of college I was essentially a "bookie for stocks" (I was an equity market maker).
The problem with your example is that it assumes symmetrical bets.  Each side will simultaneously need to make the same sized, offsetting bets.  If this is the case, BTC would work.
It falls apart when you have asymmetrical betting.  If one person wants to bet $1,000 but 10 people want to bet $100 for example - and if those bets roll in at different times (so, different spreads).  You will need the bookie (market maker) to facilitate this.  


We already do this all over the place in the financial world.  They are ubiquitous, instantly tradeable, customizable, marked to market, etc.
I see that certain aspects of bitcoin have potential - I studied CS in college and I'm a professional financier by trade.  However, I do not see it as "revolutionary" give my exposure to both:  Rather, I see it as "evolutionary."

A very small percentage of people appear to have that need right now.  A much larger percentage of the world's population is doing fine.

This here is a political phrase, not an economic one.  I can't think of very many reputable economists (In fact, I can't think of one) that believes that deflation is a good thing in an economy.  We have plenty of tools to accommodate inflation - deflation is far more pernicious.  
Your comments are political in general.  They express a disappointment with the tendencies of mankind, and instead reflect a desire to impose a New World Order ruled by digital technocrats.  
Bitcoin is just another form of money.  It is not a new paradigm, nor is it a revolution in economics.  It is a fiat currency which can alternatively act as a medium of exchange or as property.  Its value is derived in its usefulness to those who utilize it as such, and nothing more.  It has no intrinsic value in and of itself, period.  It has a built-in inflationary mechanism, and purports to limit supply in the long-distant future *if it even survives.*  It solves few things that we haven't developed an acceptable solution for already (the Byzantine General problem being one of the few useful problems it has solved, at least thus far).

It didn't stop it, but it's put a slight chill on it.  I used to use bit torrent.  Heck, I was on bulletin board systems back when I was in middle school (late 80's/early 90's) uploading and dowloading games at 1 MB/hr on my 2400 baud modem (I worked part time retail to afford the phone line and charges).  I was collecting music off the internet before there was a Napster.
Then, things changed:  I had I made it to a point of my life where I had something to lose.  A life, a wife and child, a house, assets.  A career with a reputation.  What was a free copy of X-Men:  First Class worth to me at that point?  I can tell you this:  Ten years ago I would have simply gotten the torrent.  Today, I pay the $20 for the Bluray.

For the small percentage of the world with such a need, there's Bitcoin.  Of course, the usefulness of that Bitcoin is dependent on the extent of its use in each local economy.  If I have dollars, and I'm trying to send cash to somebody who needs rupiahs, then there are going to be some costs involved there and possibly some risk.  
As it relates to counterparty risk, Bitcoin is a solution to a problem that doesn't need solving.  We have credit cards; Visa, Mastercard and American Express all willingly take on that risk in exchange for a fee.  Last time I checked, the Bitcoin world was not fee-free.

I'm well aware of what an ad hominem attack is (of course, you might very well be that guy who's always throwing out terms like "ad hominem," or "straw man," or "correlation is not causation").  
This is not exactly a fallacy, as you might be suggesting.  In courts of law, [credibility]( is often the focal point of many arguments when it comes to the opposing discussion of "fact."  
Mr. Gilder's own actions have established his credibility (or lack thereof) in the court of my own mind, which I have relied up on (for better or worse) for several decades.  It's [heuristics]( like these that allow humans to make the thousands of decisions they do each day, without stopping to hold a drawn-out internal discussion each time.

If I need to use tokens in this possible future, then they will no doubt be available for me to accumulate.  Surely, individuals will value my work in the same fashion they value it today, and will compensate me accordingly.
It isn't easy to find dollars these days, but I have no problem pulling a lot of them out of the economy and using them as I need.

A gold bug is different from an investor who simply buys gold.  I owned gold.  I bought it at $550 or so at the end of '05/early '06; I got out not quite at "the top" but a reasonable $1700 in the first quarter of 2012.  *It was just another investment.*  I did not buy it because it was a magical good; I bought it because it had a nice price momentum going and I buy into those sorts of things as a general trading principal.
One thing is certain:  Private gold ownership was largely outlawed in 1933.  There is no dispute here.  The same thing could absolutely happen to BTC.  Having studied computer science, and having a decent grasp of how the Internet works, I am *absolutely confident* that the government could carry through with a ban in a way that would be meaningful and material to holders of BTC and those who depend on its use in the economy.
It won't be perfect - but it will work well enough.  You don't have to kill BTC:  You just have to disable it - which is what a ban would do.

That's not how prices work.  You should take that up with people who make up GAAP and IFRS accounting rules.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:01:26


It's important here that you separate these two transactions:
* Your capital gains as it relates to the BTC you bought at $30 and sold at $585 (this is the federal tax we are discussing);
* Sales tax, assessed by the local taxing authority, on your $585 purchase of a laptop.
It is no different than accounting for a stock purchase:  I buy XYZ for $30; I sell it for $585; I pay capital gains on it.  If I take that $585 and buy a laptop, I will pay *separate* taxes to a *separate taxing authority* on that particular transaction, but it is totally unrelated to the BTC capital gains issue.
So on to your next question.  The miner *earned* this income (I'm assuming that is how they are going to characterize it).  They will pay income tax on that, at which point it becomes the miner's property.  If the miner decides to buy a $585 laptop, then the miner will pay applicable *sales taxes* on the laptop transaction - but that's it.


I've said it before:  There's nothing new about how the IRS is treating this.  The rules exist in plain sight.  I'm able to explain them because I've applied them elsewhere in the past.  They are neither mysterious nor confusing if you are educated in the subject.  Education is key, however.

With regards to your question - yes, you will be paying CGT on your BTC with a $30 basis, because you *bought* the bitcoin to begin with (it was purchased as a capital asset, not received as income).  This transaction should not be viewed in conjunction with your laptop purchase:  You are only being taxed on the federal level on the capital gains you earned by holding the BTC.
Had you instead earned the BTC as income, you would have paid income tax on it, but it will not be taxed further *in that fashion.*
Tax on the *purchase transaction* (sales tax) is done at the state level - the IRS would not factor in here.  It would be the same for BTC or any other fiat.

$410?  LOL.  How is that price related to anything?
If we're going to speculate on near-term price movements, then let's talk shop.  The low this weekend was approximately USD 43X (I think 438 but I can't remember).  If you go below that, you're not just going to go a little bit below it - you're going to go far below it.  Then there's the issue of round numbers...people like them.  So $400 will be the magnet price next.  
I suspect that if you break $400, you could easily see $300 - at which point you're looking at a full-blown panic and crash.
Why can there be such a crash?  Because bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  There are no floor prices supported by anything fundamental.  Bitcoin could just as easily be worth USD 0.000001.
*Edit* - BTC is now at that low (436.1 on bitcoinity as I speak). We'll have a chance to see this unfold in real-time.

What will likely happen is that regulators will expect financial institutions/intermediaries to put in the appropriate tools/safeguards/etc. to enable this sort of thing.  It will probably be part of their anti-money laundering compliance, or something of that sort.  
We have long established methods of determining beneficial ownership - because for hundreds of years people have tried to come up with ways to hide/shield money from taxing authorities.  It's still a cat-and-mouse game but recognize reality:  You are facing off against the powers of the state, which are vast and practically limitless.  Most people don't want to engage in financial insurgency for a few hundred bucks at the risk of financial ruin.  They simply pay the tax and move on.

Wrong from the start.


Incorrect.  Generally you'll see your trend do better as volatility drops.


Not really.  There are reasons to trade in options for their volatility, but trading directionally (momentum) definitely isn't one of them if volatility is your goal.


Not according to what you said above.


Slippage is largely an academic problem that only needs to be solved for in somebody's model.  It's like asking "how do you account for set and drift when navigating a ship."  A ship will not track a course directly - it will drift due to the speed and direction of water below them.  A ship will generally track a course, but it will be slightly off.  Set &amp; drift - just like slippage when purchasing.

What's funny about a comment like this is that they are indistinguishable from what a gold bug would say.  It's all about government manipulation, QE, debasement of the currency, America is failing, etc. ad nauseum.  
If you want to see how perceived "safe havens from the government" really work out in times of distress, look into what the U.S. government did to private gold holdings during the depression.  You can't track gold - but they made it illegal to hold.  That put a quick end to its use as a safe haven, right when people needed it.
Unless BTC supplants (replaces) dollars, you're going to have to earn your money somehow.  Once you've spent the BTC you've mined and accumulated in "the early days," there will be a fixed supply that will most likely reside in the hands of the most powerful institutions (in other words, it will not be democratically spread out and decentralized).  You will not be happy when these large holders mete out BTC as they like.

PS Say what you want about volume, but I'll tell you this:  In a rising market, low volume indicates that something is becoming harder to buy.  In a falling market (BTC has been falling for some time now), it shows that something is becoming harder to sell.  It is not an indication of a massive reversal in the opposite direction, if that's what you're suggesting.

I don't see this third party as being a big deal to people.  I certainly don't see it as a problem so big as to require people to switch monetary regimes.  


This is not true.  I've gone through this with others, but the IRS hasn't done anything new or unique here to BTC that they haven't done elsewhere.
[From the IRS circular](
*"The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer."*
The *character* of the transaction is key here.  The IRS is not treating BTC any differently than any other currency here.

Currency can be both a commodity and money.  That isn't even a question.  It can be treated differently for purposes of taxation as well, just as the IRS has done with bitcoin.
Currencies are programmable, certainly infinitely divisible, and we've absolutely figured out how to wire it digital anywhere in the world.  "At no cost?"  We could do that *if we wanted to* (in other words, that's not a "revolutionary" feature).

My father was no idiot - he's a physician.  He saw the booming market for ED treatments.  What he didn't see was people's unwillingness to inject their penis with a syringe or stick pills into the tip.  He was all over message boards just like this *years* ago, touting the benefits of this treatment and how people would "slowly come around.

That is not correct.  Bitcoin is not that sort of market.  The value of bitcoin isn't tied to anything.  It can be whatever you want it to be.
If the price of BTC rose *right now* to $1,000, you would not see an equal number of people making and losing money.  Instead, you have simply created something out of nothing.
This exactly how assets work, and why financial calamities occur.  Asset prices can rise to whatever level people are willing to take them - "the moon," for example.  Liabilities, on the other hand, tend to stay pretty steady.  The value of a liability only goes down if it's paid down, written down, etc.

It's close enough.  Have you ever read "The Merchant of Venice?"  The average person has between 8 and 22 pounds of flesh (skin).  A single pound is not "all of your skin."  So, which pound can you afford to lose and keep going as if everything was fine?  Which countries can BTC be banned in and still survive as a viable means of transaction?
Now imagine that, instead of a pound of flesh, [we're talking about 24% of your flesh,]( which is the US share of global GDP.  Think you can live without 24% of your flesh?  Do you think that an economy can live without 24% of inputs?  Probably not.

Data won't fix your underlying issues.  I have data all over the place on all sorts of different things.

That's beside the point here.  I often share data with people where it applies and don't get paid to do it.
What will sharing data with you do?  It will not make you more educated on the subject.  It will lead to more arguing - arguing over the data itself; its sources; its transformations; etc.  I'll have provided you with what you're looking for (half the stuff I have, half I could find), and in the end I wouldn't have earned a goddamned dime doing it and you'll still love Bitcoin.
We are not talking about two people here discussing the minutiae of finance, for which data would help resolve issues.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of a few things here (momentum, volatility, the role of slippage to name a few), *none of which* have anything to do with Bitcoin or even the price of tea in China.

*Edit* You should be looking at A7:  *"The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.*"  Because you're an expert, you'll know what this means.

You're just shifting money around.  Money not spent by retailers is money not earned by those performing other services.  See about re:  "no idea what you're talking about."  


[5 Billion](  Lol.  However, Bitcoin is not the hidden answer to the unbanked.  Rising economic fortunes would just as easily address that problem - just as a stronger legal framework would.  Those people aren't necessarily want for help, however:  The unbanked are typically the poorest individuals, living on less than $5 a day.  They have no need for bitcoin, because they probably don't even have a computer to engage in these transactions.  Most are likely engaging in pay-in-kind barter systems.
I suggest you hold off on the insults.

"Will be" proven?  As in, in hindsight?  We have a range of valuations across well over 100 years of recorded equity market history.  We are not in a new and dangerous place by any means.


The old "QE goosing the market" row.  I know this to be speculation at best.  [McKinsey, for example, disagrees:](
*"We found little evidence that ultra-low interest rates have boosted equity markets. We cannot discern a large-scale shift into equities as part of a search for yield by investors, and price-earnings ratios and price-book ratios in stock markets are no higher than long-term averages. Although stock prices do react to announcements by central banks, these are transitory effects that do not persist.*"

I've never really been as close to one as I have here on reddit; When it came to stocks I would generally stay away from the message boards full of the faithful (it happens every time) and usually only see the end result ("Trail of Tears").

Nearly everybody I can think of charges a flat rate.  It's right around $8 per trade in most plain-vanilla instruments you'd be associated with.


You'll find that if you want to have an "account" *anywhere* that is meaningful, you're going to have to pay for it.  If you aren't paying directly, then you're paying indirectly.  There are no free lunches.
You covered that in trading fees.


These are related to mutual funds, which are structured financial products.  If one day you come across a structured BitCoin product, you can be sure as shit you'll pay a fee to maintain the structure.


This is an issue of Federal Taxation.  I know that BTC resides in the same wonderful world as Internet shopping, but let's be clear:  It's only a matter of time before BTC gains (losses) are taxed just as any other transaction or holding might be taxed.


These don't sound any more confusing than fees I pay to Fidelity or Charles Schwab, but I addressed that already, didn't I?

Analog is just *one form* of currency.  I've been in institutional finance for 13 years and do you know how many times I physically paid for something, or received physical payment after selling something?  Never.  They are all just numbers on the screen.  
A March '14 US Treasury future is a digital contract, made out of thin air, traded between two counterparties just as you have said.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange steps in and acts as a clearinghouse to backstop both the buyer and the seller, using mark-to-market in order to eliminate funding risks from either party.  
Fees?  This contract has a face value of $100,000 and I pay $2.40 to trade it (retail).  It's instantaneous and highly liquid.
I'm telling you, in a nice way:  You don't even know what you don't know.  I understand technology - believe me (I might have said this already but I have a CS degree and do a fair amount of heavy programming) - but I also understand finance...something which you might be lacking in.

This is the article of faith that you, as a Bitcoin enthusiast, are trying to push.  That's all it is - an anticipation that *others* will view this same "value proposition" and your economic circle will grow.  This is *far* from certain.
Bitcoin to inflation is a solution in search of a problem.  Equally problematic for any growing economy would be a restrictive system which did not grow the money supply in proportion to growth in the economy.  Deflation can be as bad a problem for an economy (in fact it's usually worse) as this purported inflation "problem" is.
One must also account for interest (money isn't free - you knew that from your deep knowledge of monetary theory), which adds to the confusion of a fixed money supply regime.

As attractive as I suspect you believe that sounds, that is not what is meant by zero-sum.  [From Wikipedia](
*"Many economic situations are not zero-sum, since valuable goods and services can be created, destroyed, or badly allocated in a number of ways, and any of these will create a net gain or loss of utility to numerous stakeholders. Specifically, all trade is by definition positive sum, because when two parties agree to an exchange each party must consider the goods it is receiving to be more valuable than the goods it is delivering. In fact, all economic exchanges must benefit both parties to the point that each party can overcome its transaction costs, or the transaction would simply not take place."*

If my end goal is to get food in my belly, a roof over my head and clothes on my back, then it doesn't matter to me whether I'm using bitcoin, Dollars or Pounds, or some other unit of measure.  If I'm living paycheck to paycheck (again, a huge portion of the world) all that matters to me is that I'm being paid the unit of account that best facilitates my transaction.  This means not having to convert my money to buy what I want.
I think it's great that there are people out there who live a life of disobedience.  I dabble in this sort of thing all the time.  However, I stress not to overestimate people's desire to be "disobedient," vs. their desire to just get on with their lives in the simplest fashion possible.

Could you explain to me why a negative interest rate environment would cause you to have to pay a fee to own money?  By that, I mean  could you explain how the value of a dollar bill sitting in front of me will incur a fee in a negative rate environment.

A fiduciary who put you into bitcoin would probably set himself up for a lawsuit.
@_date: 2015-10-22 14:48:43
As it should be, since bitcoin is a fiat currency.

Gold is a commodity.  There are steps involved in adding value, from mining the gold, to refining it, etc.  
Note that in many countries, VAT only applies to gold used for industrial purposes (gold for investment is excluded).

So, that's your only argument eh?  Interesting.  All these "idiots."  With computer science degrees, from good schools, with significant sums of money on the line, and with the source of your "great" code available to the public, will be unable to compete with the neckbeards of Yep, gotcha.

Given that financial intermediation and fractional reserve banking exist, it's difficult to characterize them as "fables" or refute their existence through science.  Perhaps you meant to imply something else?

You don't get it. The concept of a blockchain is not unique to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:57:06
Perhaps some people are trying to think of what bitcoin and the blockchain will look like once you've mined all the bitcoins.

Here, it seems to me as if you don't fully appreciate what it means for  4.3% of the world's population to produce over 16% of the economic value in the world.  It certainly isn't an accident.
Just as somebody such as yourself would consider bitcoin to be inseparable from the blockchain, the rest of us understand that the U.S. Dollar is a component of a much larger and more powerful economic and military system.
I suggest that you read into Hobbes, Locke and the concept of the social contract.  It may help you better understand what it means to be a sovereign; what it means to wield absolute and plenary power within a defined border.  If it suits the needs of the United States, and for whatever reason, bitcoin could absolutely find itself banned (just as the private holding of gold was once banned), relegating dreamers like you to the fringes of society - and in the name of what, exactly?

The easiest way to deal with low interest rates in finance is to simply move into assets which benefit from lower rates.  It isn't a conspiracy.

Ya it has actually turned out - thus far, at least - to be a *terrible* decision based solely on the wealth that has been destroyed.
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:57:37
I suspect that you don't actually know what that means as it relates to banking.
First off, the "science of finance/banking" (as I call it) is very much open source.  It's right there for anybody to learn.  The mathematical relationships are all straightforward, and every player can use his/her own version/understanding/model/etc. of the underlying concepts in order to conduct business.  
Second, there is a *tremendous* amount of competition out there.  It's probably one of the most competitive markets in the world.  After all, in the end it's a commodity business.
The two things I mentioned above - the transparency of the concepts, and the high level of competition - should make clear to you that finance/banking is far from the clubby, closed-door, arcane, etc. industry you've painted it as.  Quite the opposite:  It's highly competitive, in many ways very much on the cutting edge, with thousands of independent actors trying to one-up each other whenever they can.

At least one person here understands.  So much jizz production here for bitcoin to the moon has overshadowed the fact that, once again, it's the *technology* that's useful, not the currency itself.

As I noted to the other poster, it's closer to 35% of the total wealth; that "wealth" is tied up in *many* different mediums - currencies, commodities, securities, loans, real assets, art, etc.

You're getting downvotes because people have lost money, which makes them very edgy and upset.  
I'm not a woman, but I work in the financial services industry and I can tell you that sitting on a losing position is probably a lot like the worst sort of menstruation you can imagine, except the blood is pouring out of your ears and eyes and not your vagina.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:47:43


This is dead wrong.  *Dead*.  *Wrong*.
A drop in the value of your investment that is indistinguishable from the noise created by everyday volatility should mean nothing.
A drop in the value of your investment that is material - I like to use the metric of 15% or more - tends to mean that you were just wrong.  Wrong in terms of the investment, wrong in terms of timing, wrong in terms of position sizing, whatever.
The *worst* thing you can do when you're wrong, by the way, is add to your investment ("dollar cost averaging").  Throwing good money away at a losing investment is the best way to lose in the long run, for a variety of reasons.

It's a little closer to 35%, and "the 1%" is more than 1 person.
