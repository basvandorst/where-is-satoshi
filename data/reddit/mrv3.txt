Why would cold storage whose passwords got lost when the CEO died having their balance drained... questions we won't know the answer to.

I mean you have all the signs of a telltale exit-scam story... and also the conclusion of the exit scam.
It's like getting to the end of the "The complete story of Hitler 1889-1945" and going
"Oh I wonder what the twist will be in the sequels"

1. CEO has disease  Crohn’s disease 
2. Goes to India for humanitarian reasons... A country not known for water quality or medicine but very high corruption if one might need a death certificate (unrelated)
3. Dies from disease which doesn't kill like the vast majority of the time with only a slightly reduced lifespan.
4. Announced months later by wife no one knew about
5. CEO with severe chronic disease had the only access to cold wallets
6. Doesn't reveal cold wallets to verify likely because they will be drained
I mean does that sound like a scam?
