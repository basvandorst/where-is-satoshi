Thanks for the explanation. Still have a lot to learn but this has been a great help.

I asked a simple question yesterday in my city's sub about stores that accept it, and was wholly unprepared for the comments that I got in return. I had no idea how much Joe Public HATES Bitcoin, it's going to take something a lot more mainstream than Megaupload to give it traction with consumers that don't/can't understand the technology underpinning it.

Thanks for the explanation. What do you mean when you say the nonce is incremented until the value saturates?
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:01:43
Yup, really.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:42:07
Great explanation, thanks for your insight.

Bought a bunch of silver from JM Bullion and got a discount for using BTC. Was shipped within 12 hours, not sure how long it took to confirm.

It wasn't just there, those guys are a joke. Even people in railed me and used the "fake money" defense.

When I am running a miner, I'm creating a hash of the previous block's transactions accompanied by the appropriate number of leading zeros and a nonce, correct? Does my miner just randomly generate hashes and then check the answer with other miners on the network, or does it receive some information about the previous block before beginning the hashing process? That's the only part of the mining process I haven't been able to wrap my head around, since the process does not seem to be bandwidth intensive.
Also, on Slush Pool I am given a statistic of the number of seconds that I contributed to the last block found. Does this mean that I in some way contributed a valid portion of the hash? If that is the case, is the hashed solution not generated by a single miner in the pool?

keep this to your quarantined sub stable genius.

Back to $15k easy. Trump thinks it’s bad, so that’s proof that it’s actually great.

I think he's just realized that certain events are insignificant and improved his resolve, choosing instead to hodl at all times and make that sweet, sweet green.

From my understanding the Winklevoss twins tried to get an exchange traded fund (etf) approved by the SEC that would allow investors to put traditional investment money in a fund that tracked Bitcoin performance. Their application was denied.

Nah bruh you live in the future on DMT
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:05:09
I got you.
BTC: $15k
Monero: $50k

Am currently holding the holy trinity + some platinum. Feels good.
@_date: 2016-09-19 13:04:08
Come on now
@_date: 2016-09-13 12:56:41
I think she's done that.
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:14:04
I'm almost done with "The Internet Of Money" that just came out, great eye-opening book for someone like me that's not as technically familiar with BTC.
@_date: 2016-09-05 16:21:38
To be fair I don't think anybody thinks Steemit is the currency the world needs.
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:49:52
I prefer Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:27:29
Didn't know that about Tech. I got my undergrad there so I'll definitely look into that, thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:28:45
Thanks for making yourself available, I'll shoot you an email later today.

Me too, and I’m damn glad we both did because if nobody actually used it we wouldn’t be where we are today.
