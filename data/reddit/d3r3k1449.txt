Fine. Except I did no such thing. I didn't change my mind about anything.  You decided that. And, again, i'm tired of this shit, figuratively and now literally. Actually this whole sub now. Good fucking night already.

Uh Colorado teens are [smoking less]( since legalization. And all indications are that Uruguay has markedly improved it's addict situation since legalizing all rec drugs; they certainly don't have more. Plus, even *if* more people did legal smack etc than would otherwise there would still be *far* less overdoses...which presently [kill]( more Americans than car crashes. Same deal as the benefits of people drinking Jim Beam instead of something from their bathtub, seeing as how you referenced moonshine.

I can't even follow wtf you are trying to shriek at me anymore. 
And you can disagree without acting like a total jackass, you know.

Whatever. I am pretty sure I said heroin *etc* in my original post and the article I linked to was about all drug ODs incl pharma. Plus I don't see why you are so fixated on heroin here in the first place other than the fact it's probably the most dangerous hard drug. At any rate I tired of talking about this many hours ago.

You yourself made the point that moonshine is illegal because it is homemade and unregulated and thus dangerous. Same logic can be applied to any substance. 
Say or counter however you will but I do not agree at all the legalized drugs will lead to more users and it certainly won't lead to more deaths from drug use.
