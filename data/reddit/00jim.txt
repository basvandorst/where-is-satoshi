Well done mate! 
Please add a 1000th separator.  Eg: 124,643.00 instead of 124643.00.

I’m not sure how far his influence reaches into EU. But I can see what a fuckup the immigration crisis is turning into for EU. I guess they are trying to save their continent’s population decline.

Did anyone listen to the end? Where they help keep immigrants’ money safe. What the fuck?

So the exchanges that stopped transactions as a safety measure are open again ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:50:48
Spank your monkey very much. So it means it will run through new exchanges then? At least not what we currently have.

Fucking around and hodling. Need to get back in the loop. Thanks!
More specifically. Taking pics of my cat, riding my bike and drinking gin. Thanks for the privilege, bitcoin.

I knew about this but rumors were that some peripherals were going ahead anyway and that it could cause some problems. That's where I left off last time. Thanks, this is a good reply. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:44:27
Can you back that up?

I fucked up and made two posts on the same discussion. Deleted one but there was a useful comment for a second which I can no longer see. Please post here if you are seeing this helpful Redditor.

I should delete this. It was removed by a bot for using possible altcoin references. Wonder why it's still up...

Well people are putting their dollar life savings into BTC so some predictions would be a natural result. But the day we refer to a beer as 12Satoshis instead of a Bitcoin is worth $50,000 which can buy me a beer is the day I’m waiting for. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:28:37
Yes. And then 80-90k by june. Or nothing.

1. Wow, you have negative karma. That’s impressive. 
2. It works for them, and I like it.

Where were you earlier?? English is not my first language.

Bra. I live in Woodstock. It's not like it's significantly getting better anywhere else.

Fuck. Agian.

"87/"88 we were on the edge of a civil/race war. Most okes packed up and ran. Nobody bought any property. The people that stuck around are smiling all the way now. 
SA's farmers are really having a bad time and yes we have crazy problems but it's going to be rough 5 years followed by great times. 
I also don't get all the bitching when we are talking Bitcoin. It's international and you can use it anywhere if you want. It's not like you have to stick to ZAR. 
(I am in Cape Town and it's a lot better in the Western Cape than the rest of the country so I might sound a little optimistic but it's not that bad!)

Oops. Got exited!
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:07:12
Yes. Trail run. Let's hope it works. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:51:30
Well, not really. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:06:41
Yes. I meant trial. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:37:37
I'm just going to stop. Let's focus on the post rather.
