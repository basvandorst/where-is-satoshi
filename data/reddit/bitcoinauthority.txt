I can setup a VPS for $35 a year at ChicagoVPS (see below).
I am running a node myself over there and it has been very reliable:
If you folks want it, I will setup nodes for you. For every US$35 sent to the donation address on the above link I will buy one VPS for one year.
If donations are &lt;$35 I will send the BTC to Seans Outpost. 
Disclaimer: I am NOT affiliated with ChicacoVPS. I can only do this until May 31st.
If you don't (want to) trust me, you can buy a node yourself: 
Stats of the VPS:
OpenVZ VPS - Special Promotion Series 2GB
2048MB (2GB) Dedicated Ram
50 GB Diskspace
3TB Monthly Bandwidth
1Gbit Port
1x IPv4 Address

1) Over time, people will begin to sell their held Bitcoins - either out of anxiety or boredom or financial necessity.
2) Even if EVERY Bitcoin buyer were to 'hold', the price would not rise because you have no additional buyers.

Wrong about BTC plus he was recommending NVDA almost exactly at its high, just before it lost close to 50%.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:14:48
I don't lol much, but this one made me to. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:48:28
Um, no.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:12:13


 I'm sure this was the investing chance with the best chance/risk ratio for a lot longer period of time.

No KYC/AML as long as you go crypto&lt;-&gt;crypto.

It's been '10 months' for a couple of years now, but yeah, lightning will do well. (no /s)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:49:04
Man up.

They are aware of it and working on it.
I used to be a kraken fanboy but right now they are quite shitty.
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:59:04
Can confirm this. It literally takes seconds from CC buy until they are trezored. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:24:10
Same. Their support sometimes can be somewhat slow but other than that I've only had good experiences.

Owner is a redditor, btw.

yes:    
RIPEMD160(SHA256(ECDSA public key))
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:33:20
It asks for identity and location. Deal breaker. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 16:31:42
you might want to remove the "-" in the first link. kept me wondering why i got an error for a while.
edit: typos
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:46:32
It used to be like that. Then they changed it to 1-conf. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:16:59
There are plenty of people here who had 2x profits many times over and still hodl.

Even more dead than ever.

Why not get in today?

You need to look at it at log-scale...

I see. No need to start with significant amounts. Actually it might be smarter to buy small amounts every now and then. Those add up over the years.
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:31:39
Well, we took over in the mean time. Sorry.

On Emirates it costs literally $1 (one) for 500MB data usage and is available on all A380s any many 777.

Hello redditor of 2 weeks.
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:10:03
Charming as always. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 11:10:55
Uhm, no.
@_date: 2016-10-11 09:37:35
Huge bubble? BTC/USD changed by about 3%.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:07:21
What I find even more remarkable is that ETH is at &gt;40% of that. Not plugging for ETH, I find their rise noteworthy in many aspects.

When I was a kid I invested all I had into Lego. Did it pay off financially? No. Did I learn? Yes.

As a German who has been using both Kraken and Fidor (the bank she implies she is using) for a somewhat higher trading volume regularly for years, I'm tending to call BS on this. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:36:29
You can always apply over here.

Oh, the Bitcoin Foundation is still around?

I've been doing this since 2013. No regrets.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:29:18
Do you have any idea what you are talking about?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:06:42
I feel you. Thanks for your pep talk from another veteran.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:31:39
I've been using kraken for years now. Never had an issue, even with larger transfers. Transfers between my bank account and kraken literally only take minutes.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:21:19
Nothing.
