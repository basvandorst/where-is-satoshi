The bitcoin is back in my wallet! However I can't spend it?
How do I export my blockchain wallet? I can't find the option anywhere..

Could you please explain how that would work?
The  transaction left my wallet but isn't in my recieving wallet, so it's stuck inbetween I believe

The whole transaction consits of multiple sender addresses, one of these addresses had a double-spent balance.
As double-spent balance will never confirm, the whole transaction wont confirm, LBTC requires 3 confirmations..

Printscreen: 
As you can see this transaction won't confirm as there's double-spent balance in it, the BTC left my Blockchain wallet

What an relief!! How often does it re-sync the blockchain?

Yeah I got incredibly surprised when I noticed, it's a real bitcoin trap..

It didn't even go into my LBTC wallet either..

I'll gladly leave a tip if it works..
