Shapeshift works great for small amounts of conversions. Although, there have been stories about coins getting lost and customer support saying they can't do anything about it. I recently traded Ethereum for Monero using shapeshift and it was a super smooth process

I say go for it and tell us what you find out :) I'd be curious too

1. Set up an account on coinbase
2. Wait to be approved
3. Transfer money to your US dollars account
4. Go to  (sister company of coinbase. Same servers and everything.)
5. Click on deposit and select "coinbase US dollars account"
6. Learn if you want to place a market order or limit order (Google or YouTube this part)
7. Buy what you can afford
8. Either keep it on the exchange (not recommended) or buy a hardware wallet (Nano Ledger S, or Trezor) and transfer funds to the wallet
9. Learn how to make your first transaction from gdax to your hardware wallet
10. Wait 10-40 minutes for funds to appear
11. Sit back and HODL and watch Bitcoin fly to the moon
12. Read the news every day on Bitcoin 
13. Start learning how the actual block chain and mining works. You want to know what you're actually investing in. It's not the money to be made, it's the underlying technology.
14. Tell your friends about it. They'll think you're a cyber pirate that has all these magic internet coins. 
15. Buy more when you can
16. Buy into the dips
17. Don't give up when it drops 30%. It happens. I bought a bunch of bitcoins 2 days before the china ban. All that went down about 55%. I just held onto it and now we're at $7000+

That's assuming you dont convert it to Fiat currency. If you keep it as bitcoin, you are in control of your money and no one else.

Because you are not trading US dollars for any crypto currency you are not required by law to provide identification for who you are. This exchange deals strictly with crypto currency‘s. In the United States it is required by law that if you use US dollars on an exchange to buy stocks, crypto currency, or something of that sort, you need to be verified. Shape shifter is a website that essentially allows you to trade your bananas for oranges. Not dollars for oranges. But once you use US dollars to buy oranges at the grocery store, you will be taxed, ID’d, the company has to follow laws, and the store has to follow regulations.
This is an over simplification, but think of it like craigslist. Some dude wants a lawn mower and you want a mattress. You trade the items and there is no need to report that transaction anywhere except between you two. It’s like trading litecoin for bitcoin. But if you want to buy a mattress from a store with US dollars, then you need to follow more rules and regulations.
Any time US dollars are involved, you need to go though an exchange that allows for it and is certified. 
Shapeshifter doesn’t deal with US dollars so to answer your question, yes. It’s legal. But so is Coinbase. But they are doing things completely different.
Kraken has on their website:
“Tier 3 - fiat currency funding is available to Tier 3 clients and funding limits are much higher than Tier 2. You are required to upload a valid Government ID and a recent proof of residence (can be uploaded under 'Get Verified' tab of your Kraken account). In order to deposit fiat in the US, Canada, Germany, Japan, and other countries depending on what currency you intend to deposit, Tier 3 verification is required.”

It could definitely happen, it's Bitcoin after all ;)

No one knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but, some have been saying to buy half before and half after to average out risk
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:40:30
I feel you. Some days I want to cash out, some days I want to hodl, some days I wonder if the price will dip to $1000. I'm most likely just not going to do anything though. If it dips, I will buy into the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:33:25
No one really knows. It's all predictions
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:16
This is a great resource. Thanks!

Do nothing. Then after the fork wait for further instructions from the hardware wallet manufacturer on how to send bitcoins safely without replay attacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:39:05
Yeah the date was formatted weird haha. Took me a second too :P
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:18:18
I'm with you 100% on this. This would be most appreciated. Every day I get on this subreddit, I see these same posts:
How do I buy Bitcoin?
What is the fork?
Should I buy before or after the fork?
Why are coinbase fees so high?
How do I prepare for the fork?
When will Bitcoin crash?
Should I get a hardware wallet?
Some generic article about Bitcoin 
New ATH! &lt;Insert $ amount here&gt;
It would be nice if beginners could use the damn search bar. Or Google it first. The subreddit is flooded with shit posts. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:55:43
Nahhh I kinda like it
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:26:50
I’ll buy them from you

I hope no one falls for this scam
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:13:15
I want this.

In 20 years that hat will read $RETIRED
