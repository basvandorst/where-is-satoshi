My buddy showed me some bitcoin exchange. I LMAO'd at how their paid service had prices... in U.S. dollars. I tease him mercilessly but he's rich and I'm not so at least he has the money to blow on stuff like this.

Oh you want an unpopular opinion? 
**Actual unpopular opinion**: Speculation and engaging in criminal activities is about all crypto currency is really good for. In cases where it helps some oppressed dissident buy something they need, I'm for it. When it helps some POS scumbag put a hit on someone, buy controlled substances, engage in slavery, or dodge taxes I think it sucks. You'll know it has reached peak shitbaggery when wallstreet moves in and starts doing it.

Also it's possible to pay for someone's beer on the Internet with standard currency too right?

I don't plan on using bitcoin until and unless my mortgage company starts accepting it in payment, and probably not even then. I fully expect all you fuckers to keep pushing it until there will come a point in time - and this may be when I finally snap - when my employer wants to pay me in bitcoin but none of my creditors accept it. Kind of like how some super terrible low paying jobs now scam their employees by paying them (I swear this is a thing that happens) with some kind of bullshit money card which *of course* has a ton of fees, so they make less than ever. The companies that handle these cards rake in the bucks, provide a service for the employers, and who gets the shaft? The employees. THAT is what I expect will happen with your precious fucking bitcoin.
I much prefer my currency to be backed by the U.S. government. (and direct deposited paychecks, for that matter.)
