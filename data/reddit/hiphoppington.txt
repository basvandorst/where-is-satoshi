I'll raise the Satoshi Signal.

That is the absolute best idea. I've been using Soundcloud for some time as a dumping grounds for all of my shitty recordings. I'd be absolutely happy to drop some coin their way.

Man, what where they even thinking using that picture?

I'd like to make a withdrawal please.

Snarky. I like it.

I've been getting them the last couple hours too. it just really seems to me like maybe they should have set that BTC number a little lower if they wanted it to be believable.

Guys, I went through this dude's post history and I don't think this is really @_date: 2014-03-12 17:20:43
I certainly don't doubt that things like this happen but I'd love a source for

Technically true I suppose.

@_date: 2014-01-15 19:27:07
He definitely did question it at one point but he always said he doesn't know. He had Dr. Tyson on his podcast and the two of them pretty quickly put that to rest.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:32:23
I don't know. Sort of sounds like something someone with a lot of money would do if they took a serious interest in the subject. To each their own, I think.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:13:46
If I'm not mistaken it did actually originate here but I'm all for it being co-opted. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:10:58
Huh. This is the first I've heard of them. Maybe I need to check them out.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:18:54
Man I bought something in btc from them a couple weeks ago. Always miss the deals I see.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:58:12
This is the cream of the crop. The juiciest bitcoin drama plot-twist I could imagine. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:39:16
This is good advice. i'll absolutely do this, thanks.

Sounds like your typical Wednesday.

How exactly do I buy instantly with my bank account via bitquick.co?

Wow is this what I think it is?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:59:35

It's apparently at least both of you.

It is a recent change and while I understand it I'm pretty butthurt about it. I've heard people say they've been able to verify with VISA debit cards but that has not been my own experience. I was doing fairly well buying on coinbase and reselling elsewhere and now I can't : /

I'm having a tough time imaging any scenario where I'd be happy to pay 7 dollars for a Bud.

This is what living in the future feels like.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:28:19
I've been using it myself. It is difficult, as best as I can tell, to get USD *into* the exchange but once there trading is quick, easy, painless, and potentially very profitable.
Day trading can be super duper stressful though. You don't, or I didn't, appreciate just how volatile this market is until I began trading.

You have to understand that what he's really saying is "fix it so people who aren't good with computers understand it easily."
If I have to tell you this you care more this than you do basic social cues.

Brilliant. Absolutely will do.

I'd really like to be able to buy smaller quantities of coins if need be. The smallest i can get via coinbase is .1 which, while only 20 bucks, is  only going up and up.
A good thing ultimately but still
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:13:29
The people that are brave enough to order something from a site that has gone up and down like this, especially in light of other closures, have balls so big I bet they have to internet standing up.

I've got a Chrome add on ticker for all coins I'm invested in.

@_date: 2013-11-05 18:41:37
Seems hit or miss. Mine didn't work and I could not be more butthurt about it.

You're made of tougher stuff than I. I could never buy a guitar without having first had my hands on it. Need to know how *it feels*, you know?

I read one once that said something to the effect of, "I just got stoned, ate a pizza, and sent you 5 cents."
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:59:21
Certainly worth considering. Thanks for the idea.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:59:15
Make sure to set the amount to USD instead of BTC. Should fix it up.
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:47:10
I'm sorry, a brief question. How quick is the turnaround would you say on this site? I'm hesitant to buy the coins before I sell them and would much rather buy per order. Financially, buying in advance is a tough proposition for me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:43:15
I don't think you want to play that game.

I picked up a handful of namecoins right about the time you posted this. It's a coin I've been interested in for some time and it's starting to feel like it might be a good investment.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:42:10
Probably, but I'm willing to gamble it a little. We'll see how it plays out.

My concern with localbitcoin is largely my location. I would be *very* surprised if I got a hit off of that with it. I'm going to put flyers around town probably at least though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:23:30
But think of all the bitcoins you could buy by selling that story to the tabloids.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:50:56
[That's my bad. I certainly meant to before.](
This is the one for BTC but if you search the webstore for "____coin + ticker" I bet you'll find one for what you want. Found all of mine right off the bat.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:31:12
That's exactly what I was doing locally before the change. Lots of people wanted them but many didn't understand how to best go about it. It was easier for them to just get it from me. Win / win.

And back when SR1 went bust. I was not opposed to 80 dollar BTC.

@_date: 2013-11-18 18:39:32
Big fan of that place. I often read it for fun. I do think I might be banned though. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:52:52
I mean, I guess it's still something that maybe some people will need to consider but I agree. We're up hundreds of percent. Crypto is crazy volatile, this is just part of it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:34:33
Not with that attitude.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:54:29
This is exactly why I only put into bitcoins what I can personally afford to lose. It's something I believe in strongly but you just never know how things will play out.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:35:07
Well, I am absolutely in it. We'll see how this goes. If it's all the same to you, I may contact you in the future if you're involved with the behind the scenes on this website. Questions and what not. I'm determined to make this work and don't believe in stupid questions, only getting answers :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:00:24
Same. i'd really like one, just to have it. Don't care if it's empty. I just think it'd be neat.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:58:38
Indeed it is :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:27:44
No, but I admit I really enjoyed Shutter Island. Where the confidence for me falls apart is Hollywood being willing to tell a story with details instead of it being a generic action thriller. I doubt it's going to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:58:45
Kids, without years of bias and experience, are very good at cutting through bullshit.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:21:29
I actually just picked up a few Namecoins. Few Peer ones too. Mostly for fun but I agree, the DNS aspect of Namecoin is pretty interesting. 
Who knows, we'll see what happens. Never spend what you aren't willing to lose, right? might be fun.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:29:03
Selling TF2 hats was basically my precursor for getting involved in bitcoins. Silly, but true.
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:40:09
Unless I'm mistaken the writer for the movie Shutter Island is confirmed to be working on the script.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:18:21
It may be. I put up a little. We'll see how it plays out. I've got a chase account I opened just for this. I really do appreciate the tip.
Another question though, are there really that few sellers? If the website sells about 50 BTC a day and I pull in 5-10 of those myself that doesn't leave much room for other sellers. (edit - not that that is a bad thing I suppose)
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:05:05
This was definitely not my experience as well. I tried using my visa debit card and was denied.
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:03:14
I want to say that I heard that he did during the sites early days but I've heard a lot of things the last 24 hours and wouldn't be in a position to verify much of any of it.
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:52:13
I admit, I'm not. I can only speak from my personal beliefs and that is that murder is wrong. The reasons can be *understandable* but, for me, that never makes them right.
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:45:41
Just noticed that. Classy.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:12:08
This is incredible dude. Give this a couple years and maybe I'll join you in beautiful car brotherhood.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:56:21
I'd like to be the first to volunteer for that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:07:46
Yea, I skimmed it a couple of times and I had the exact same thoughts. I think people just get so caught up in the idea that they forget about what will happen if they get caught.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:16:05
Oddly, I set up a reoccurring buy of ten dollars a week that went through twice. I wasn't able to do it again though and was told I needed to buy the minimum.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:54:34
I'm torn here. I support the idea as I believe adults should be able to do what they please and I think being able to get what you want online instead of braving dangerous streets and people. It seems win / win for society at large.
it's just always seemed so out there, risk wise. I couldn't imagine taking a risk like that. And now, given everything that's happened?
There are some people with either huge balls, or some people who are very naive. I hope it works out well for everyone involved though. Just stay safe people. Bag of pot isn't worth your life.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:40:57
I have *a lot* of these, for fun mostly. Didn't really put any money into it.
I saw this yesterday and very seriously nearly had a heart attack.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:39:59
Sure, I get that. I'd never tell someone what to do I've just read a lot of people getting really excited about this or other markets. That eagerness  might be what gets people in trouble.
All I'm saying, really. I guess I'm hardly an expert on these things though.
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:35:11
I'll do that right now, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:33:12
I admit I don't know. Maybe. I'm doing it weekly at the moment so I'm pretty sure I can stomach that hit :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:52:11
I believe you.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:04:39
Really wish that worked for me :(
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:35:35
I certainly understand that. I'm not saying it's right, but it is how things are. They're keeping a very watchful eye on that group of people whether it makes sense or not.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:43:52
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:13:12
I'm sure any minute someone will tell us all about how this is just another step in some conspiracy.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:35:41
I'm not saying anyone did or didn't. Just spreading good practice.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:01:36
I'll pass. You seen to be doing pretty well for yourself.
Also, big fan of your work. Etc etc
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:52:22
Second for this. Few minutes away from my second reoccurring payment at a fixed price. I really like it.
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:25:23
I can't figure any other reason honestly. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:26:11

@_date: 2013-09-17 01:08:22
I've definitely added you to my friend's list on here. I'm going to play around with the site over the next couple of days and I'll touch base with you. I've never been more determined to make something work.

I'd listen to this.

Nothing is uncrackable. The feds want you bad enough, they'll get you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:07:06
I was doing exactly this until they changed their instant policy. Now I can't sell to order anymore and I lost all of my business.
Was pretty happy with coinbase that day.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:37:43
Makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:13:47
I've heard that it works for lots of people with Visa Debit Cards but my experience has not been the same. I try on average once a day and all my information is entered and on file right. It might accept debit cards, but not my personal one.
I've asked on here,  opened a ticket with them a month or more ago, never heard a word and i'm still not verified.
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:39:56
I'm not against expanding into selling them online in the future and it's things like this I need to read that put it into perspective. Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:04:49


Objectively, I understand why he did it but that doesn't make murder right.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:08:36
Wow man, wow. Those are some crazy rookie mistakes. Real name? Real email?
Jesus what an idiot.
@_date: 2013-09-08 23:59:08
I do cash in person through localbitcoins, or try to but I live in a small area where not many people are into them. I'm trying to figure out the best way to branch into online sales at the moment. I'll have to check into accepting moneypak. I don't really know anything about that.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:49:27
1042 is *so* 20 dollars ago.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:36:04
I was making great use of the instant buy until this change. I'd love to be able to get reverified.
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:08:18
Oh sure, that was absolutely going to be the idea. Probably whip up a quick and easy to remember domain and just route all traffic there through my localbitcoins page.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:01:32
I did just a little. Lost just a little. Shit was too stressful. 
Then all this happened. I won't sleep tonight.

I did not know when I was a child that I would have the opportunity to contact one of my favorite characters from my favorite movie directly and securely through computer encryption.
Crazy times we're in.
keep on keeping on dude. Make that movie as awesome as you can.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:58:03
Is there any trick? Every time I try to add my Chase debit card it fails. The only option I have billing address is "New Billing Address."
I don't know if that matters but I'd really like to get back to being able to buy instantly.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:34:09
Friend of mine went voluntarily homeless for a few year stretch back in 07 maybe. He's done with it now but he's got some amazing stories. Costa Rica pot farming, hiking through Brazilian mountains, biking cross country.
Little jealous of the freedom honestly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:33:41
What I've personally been doing with BTC-E is buying on coinbase and sending them to the exchange. Obviously an issue with coinbase lately, but BTC-E itself is nice.
But i agree with you.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:27:02
Absolute babble.
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:42:43
A hundred dollars of profit a day would flat out change my life. I appreciate the inspiration and the link. I'm going to make this work. What you're doing is essentially what I want to do and I'm halfway there. I'm verified on coinbase and can do that I just need to drum up sales.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:00:27
Other than an obvious incoming correction I don't even know anymore. If you'd have asked me where we'd be last week I wouldn't have pointed to today.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:22:32
I buy a little each paycheck. What I can comfortably just lose. It's a modest amount but I am willing to gamble that on being able to sell down the line.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:55:02
I like to think the market's gains today are directly one big "fuck you" to the times.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:52:14
Looking forward to zerocoin. I hope to get in on that from the first moment I'm able. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:29:50
At the moment no one can.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:03:59
Thank you SO much for saying this. I didn't realize that with reoccuring payments you could buy the USD equivalent of less than 0.1 which is the minimum for on the spot buys.
I just set up a $10 schedule myself this moment. Thanks again, so much.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:47
You quite literally can't buy this level of irony

You do, which objectively I understand is to stop selling scams. It's a tough pill to swallow though for someone just starting out with not a lot of disposable income. It is what it is though. I can start small.

Yesterday was a valuable but harsh lesson for me.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:39:59
That's the exact same error I get. I keep trying it hoping it's a bug and will get through. it is the definition of frustrating.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:45:32
I'll be at the office all day just waiting to get in on that dip.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:19:14
Yea, you absolutely could for awhile. I did exactly that for a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:05
Save it. Any investment into your future is good for you. Who knows what that 300 will be in a year.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:48

@_date: 2013-08-29 16:35:47
I don't have much in the way of major banks anywhere near me. Would setting up an account with them be possible remotely or online? 
I guess I can go look now.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:00:09
I can't really use localbitcoins sadly. I live in a pretty rural area and we don't really have any of the supported banks around here. And I'm by far the only local person on there. 
I'll check into the other two though. have you used either? Get your coins instantly?
