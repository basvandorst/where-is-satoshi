Love bitcoin but I currently feel LTC and BAT are very undervalued and are great long term holds.

Bgold is not even mentioned! I’m sorry this cartoon is past your competence level.

Lol yeah you confused me for a second but it’s all good man. It happens to everyone!

I would love for that to happen but it would take some serious capital to effect the price in either direction.
As optimistic as I am I still have to be wary of the opposite scenario where big institutions are buying now and then as soon as the futures start they unload everything causing a dip and make money at the peak and money shorting it on the way down.

In general.
Odds are heavily against shorting bitcoin given its history. It’s extremely risky but yes if done right you can definitely make a lot of money. It’s just some people think they know how to call tops.
Agree with Bitconnect though it’s not going to end well.

If you truly believe it’s a ponzi and will fail I dare you to short bitcoin. Pleaseeeee short BTC! 
Then let us know what happens ;)

BAT, ZRX, LTC
BAT is as legit as it gets for real world token utility and the founder/team behind it are top notch.
0x is a game changer for DEX and applications being able to use it as a means of exchange.
LTC is supremely undervalued and the potential of atomic swaps and currency confidential transactions will be HUGE.

Yes, the issues regarding  the hack and speculation  of “printing” unbacked tether is concerning. But having seen/experienced bitcoin go through major news, speculation, and other issues...all this will blow over eventually. 
The main reason for the post is all the BTC trash talking on the other sub regarding tether. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:21:01
Check again fees are legitimately higher 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:22:54
Even if all the tether currently in circulation was dumped into bitcoin it would barley make a dent...
~600million vs ~130billion 
People overestimate what it’s actually doing

Go to the little settings bar on the top right and it has a night mode���� also it gives you different chart themes but make sure the app is updated

Care to share evidence? Most factor in liquidity and if there is no liquidity at such an early stage hedge funds won’t bother. Now is a good time to have enough liquidity. So it hard to believe that many were in so early. Especially with all the issues going on around that time period.

Yeah you pretty much nailed the logic behind it. At the end of the day it’s all about increasing the BTC holdings. At least BTC proponents believe that...don’t bring this topic up on r/btc they’ll try to destroy you lol 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:51:29
No don’t even bother wasting money on rigs and electricity(considering it isn’t cheap/free where you live).. by the time you make any real money the rigs will probably be obsolete. 
You are better off buying and holding some coins.

Some people just refuse to understand this. They get caught up with low fees drama but fail to understand they’ll lose more money investing in BCH then fees on BTC. 
To each there own I guess! Asia will have fun with these fools 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:20:46
It really is sad that people were sucked into the FUD and bought BCH at overinflated prices. At least new investors will understand why BTC is king and not to underestimate its existence. 
Also, it’s quite shocking bithumb is under some major heat from a server crash that left investors holding BCH they didn’t intentionally plan to hold. I guess the dump wasn’t a complete success ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:34:02
Seems like most people on the cash wagon think it’s going to change trajectory any second now �� 
Honestly I feel bad for all the people who bought at over $2k though

0x protocol is going to shock the crypto space with its limitless possibilities
