Dude, same here. Dollar seems so filthy now. I didn't have that much money to begin with but anyhow I put like 75% - 80% in crypto. Can't lose everything if you didn't have anything in the first place

I'm gonna contribute also by downloading the full core wallet and mining with my gtx 750 ti, fuck profitability, fuck BU.
Great. I just read this at slush pool: 
''Do not even try mining without an ASIC miner. Neither your CPU/GPU nor your Smart phone is sufficient for mining anymore.''
Looks like it's gonna take a while but at least I've got the full core wallet already.

That's because you don't understand what fiat currency and bitcoin means. Keep learning about it and the fear will be gone.

I had no idea you could manually disconnect from other nodes. The game is on. Only UASF-SegWit-BIP148 nodes allowed. 
It would be nice to be able to chat with the peers and tell them to signal.

There are two types of Bitcoin haters, those who don't understand it and those who are afraid of it. 
If you're dealing with the first kind, I'd suggest you start off by explaining how does the "official" monetary system works and what problems can Bitcoin solve. Bear in mind that these topics are very hard for people who don't have any background in computers, cryptography and economics. 
The second kind is pretty much self explanatory... they know damn well what's going on, so don't even bother.
Here are some arguments you can use:
- Most of the money that we use nowadays (around 96% / can't remember where I saw it) is already digital.
- Nobody should have the power to control the creation of money.
- Show them the inflation calculator, and how much buying power the dollar has lost over the years.
- If they talk about gold, you can say that it used to be the best choice when there was no internet, but now in the digital era we need to transact securely with people all around the world. Also, gold is pretty easy to counterfeit...
Good luck :D

What a great explanation... I've been trying to understand the difference between hard and soft forks for a while and it turned out to be the most simple concept ever:
Hard fork -&gt; Rules loosen up 
Soft fork. -&gt; Rules get tighter 
Most people talking about Bitcoin on YouTube have no idea of what's going on and it's just so great to have someone like Andreas to enlighten us.
