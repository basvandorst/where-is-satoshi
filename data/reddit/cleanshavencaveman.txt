Ha! Yes! basically we need to invent a cyptocurrency entirely dedicated to keeping our other cyptocurrencies safe on a blockchain. I'd like a 5% stake in this venture. We could call it: WALLET COIN.  WALLETO.  WALLETON.  TRIFOLD.  BIFOLD. PIGGYBANK.  IGGYBANK. BACKPOCKET.

I appreciate the problem and the question... but the article linked is poorly written in terms of clearly stating what the issue is.  At the bottom of the page it finally get to the point of this post:  
"The problem is this: although you certainly can securely hand out child keys with no risk to the parent key, and you can hand out master public keys with no risk to the master private key, you cannot do both at the same time. The exploit for when that situation does arise is actually quite simple, and can be done with two lines of pybitcointools code. I will use Electrum in this example, since Electrum wallets are more transparent. These are the same master public key and child private key I created above:"
The answer to this problem? I'm not sure, but I'm interested as all of my funds are on a Ledger Nano S and I'd like to be able to automatically track them via an API with some type of software for taxes.
