One of the costs to miners of increased block size is that the potential market price of transaction fees will almost certainly decrease.  If there is a lower limit on the number of transactions that can be processed per block, then people sending transactions must pay increased fees.  This is a basic microeconomic assumption, that I think is reasonable to make.  As the bitcoin network gets more popular for payments, the market price of transaction fees increases, which would in turn stimulate more miners to get running.  Bitcoin would only be feasible for larger transactions.  
Personally, I have two big problems with increasing the bitcoin blocksize or forking bitcoin. First, it threatens to lead to fragmentation of existing standards.  The only thing that makes bitcoin superior to other cryptocoins is the network effect.  Without bitcoin's hegemony, it would loose all or most of its value.  Thus, forking bitcoin, in my view, threatens to destroy the most important feature of bitcoin.
The second issue, is that, as I previously mentioned, increasing the block size decreases the market price of transaction fees, which in turn discourages continued investment in mining.  The people who argue for forking bitcoin, are suggesting that it is more important to keep transaction fees low for people who send transactions, than it is to allow them to creep up for the miners benefit.  At some point, it's simply a choice as to who one thinks should benefit.  But for me, at the end of the day, the miners run the network.  Changing the rules of bitcoin post-hoc to screw them doesn't really seem healthy for the future of bitcoin.
BTW, I don't have any conflicts of interest to declare.  I don't do any mining, and if anything I would benefit from lower transaction fees, but that's not necessarily the best thing for the bitcoin network's health, IMHO.
