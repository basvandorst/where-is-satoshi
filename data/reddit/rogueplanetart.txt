Is trusting a bunch of individual stakeholders in a system the same as trusting a central authority though? I mean, with what happened with ETH, I get the paranoia, but still... I'd certainly run a full node if I had a few dozen BTC to guard, but something tells me most users hold very little and thus aren't so invested.

Double edged sword... without the normies, BTC will never become mainstream and thus never become truly valuable, but with the Normies, BTC could become what it was created to destroy (reinforcing Newsom's Law of Imperialistic Entropy).

Awesome, thank you!

Ok, so right now (as far as I understand it, and please correct me if I am incorrect) there are really only two reasons to run a full node - 1, to protect your investment/give you control/protect your privacy, and 2, altruism. There is no TANGIBLE reward for sacrificing your electricity and bandwidth. Anyone else see this as a problem? I mean hell, if running a full node brought in a few Sats a week I'm pretty sure we'd all be running one, even if the bandwidth requirements were triple.

Essentially - although I think the other part of what I'm hinting at is that if there were a financial incentive to run a full node, we'd see a lot more of them, just like we saw a lot of people mining in the early days when letting your GPU do the work (and heat your bedroom) while you sleep could earn you a little money. Most people probably figure that it's safe enough to trust the network without their own personal verification because they're not moving around or storing massive amounts of money. To me, this seems like a weakness because a coordinated effort by powerful people could pretty easily gain a solid majority of nodes.

I'm certain you could drop more knowledge on the subject than I could - I just was noticing that it seemed like a weakness in the network with no current incentive to correct, only an incentive to exploit. Found that a bit concerning. Where should I read more about the Lightning Network payment channel scheme?

By "Stakeholders" I'm referring to people who run a full node. Doing so would really only happen if they had some sort of interest in doing so, hence the term. Sorry for any confusion.
