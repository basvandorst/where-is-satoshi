I'm done with them myself. Gdax is now only a portal to transfer fiat to my bank account lol. I'm only buying on bittrex now.

Wow, using this as a reference, I am in the top 1%. You just have to change the way you look at things lol

I've done as much research for as much as I understand. I buy a little here and there when I can afford it. I understand the concept enough to know that I want to put as much as I can into the system, which, sadly, is not much at all. But every millibit counts. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:10:52
1 bit = $1 sounds nice
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:27:04

The continents of North and South America make up "America". We are just the "United States of America", not America. When we say it, it bothers people living in other parts of the true "America". It gets their panties all knotted up, entangling their tampon string, causing more bloody vaginas.

I got this message first thing this morning. In my grogginess and pre-coffee haze, I was excited and I actually did it. Then about ten minutes later, I started freaking out, so I moved my coin from my coinbase account to a different wallet and changed my passwords. Should I still be worried? I feel so used and violated. I need to take a shower.

Just you wait until those 100 bits are worth $20,000 US next week.

@_date: 2014-06-05 22:04:42
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:33:45
I think 10btc is enough and you should give me the extra two btc that you dont need.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:35:59

@_date: 2014-12-21 18:11:00
The wonderful thing about bitcoin is, I dont understand 99% of it, but I can still buy all I want and store them on a non-activated prepaid cell phone with no Bluetooth or internet connectivity and not worry about them being hacked.
@_date: 2014-09-08 10:23:49
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:44:15

I think you read my comment yesterday, and made-up this part about your trip.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:33:54
That's not even worth 1 BTC in 2029.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:58:16
I wish you could work out something where I can get a part of my paycheck direct deposited/buy Bitcoin.

Nothing; they were both stuck up bitches.

@_date: 2015-05-15 18:33:13
It's more of an earn than a buy, really.
@_date: 2014-07-02 09:19:52
Because its the US Government. Rule  if it makes sense, its not going to happen.
@_date: 2015-05-07 12:12:53
But but but, I kind of got a half mast chub when OP said my btc will be up by 500% next year lol
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:16:14
When I see the word 'methinks' I picture OP wearing a fedora.
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:38:57

This is awesome, but I'm still going to store my btc offline. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:50:19
Those three cents might be worth 5 bucks in a couple years.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:50:40

It's like they're daring hackers to do something.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:43:48
Price is irrelevant to my buying of btc. I usually buy about $50 worth every payday, regardless of price.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:00:34
My prediction: the price will go up and down often. When it goes up, people will sell. When it goes down, people will sell. Inbetween these times, people will buy more.

Is sexism prevalent here, or do you always call everybody gentlemen?
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:33:28
I literally have no idea, but I think this is the reason for the drop. Hoping it goes back up soon. I bought .4 the other day at $754 because a friend wanted me to....buy something for him. I really hope it goes back up, because I don't want to cover the loss.

It'll get up to about $3,000 my mid-august, but will ease back to around $1,700 by 2018. Then, the moon.

Hmm. Interesting how it's climbing back to $700 right now. Thanks, Brexit.

It's only temporary.

So, I'm assuming there will be some pretty big bubbles along this trajectory, as well.

I still buy between $10 and $50 a month, because I know(hope) in 5 years those increments will be worth a shit-ton of a lot more.

They're still hella cheap compared to what it will be worth in 5 or 10 years.
