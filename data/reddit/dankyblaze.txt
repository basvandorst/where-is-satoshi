This is the worst shitpost on this sub so far today. Playing dumb just to piss on BCH and push your propaganda is idiotic. And this is coming from someone who disapproves of BCH.

 Loaning bitcoin with those stats would be completely unfair if implemented any time before 2030. Can you imagine borrowing $18,000 and being told you owe $150,000 by the end of the year? That's insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:59:43
Hmm well if they also factored transaction fees plus taxes for capital gains AND their goal truly is to reach $1 million, then they would technically need at least 6.5 BTC.

Hey everyone: play nice. Slinging needless insults to r/btc isn't helping. Don't forget that even though they are "on the other side," we're still on the same coin.

I highly recommend deleting your comment if you aren't using a throwaway account. Broadcasting you have 29 bitcoins on the internet isn't really a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:54:26
 something to the extent of "how can you truly be a supporter of bitcoin if you didn't buy in back in 2013"
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:09:16
There's nothing informative or constructive in saying clearly troll-like comments. And I'll never stop trying to understand the other side. They're not demon spawn, r/btc just passionately believes in something just like we do.

Personally I don't know the technical stuff either, but if there's a will there's a way. And I'm pretty sure nearly half a million dollars would inspire pleeenty of wills.

That wasn't a reference to his tweet. He is talking about how Ver's own greed led him from being one of the leaders in the crypotcurrency world to causing complete chaos to bitcoin by creating his own centralized version and then led a smear campaign to attempt to remove bitcoin's strength and credibility.

 If you came from r/btc, I just wanted to thank you for your courage for coming to this subreddit. I personally feel like we need to have more discussions like you're doing, rather than bashing and spreading misinformation and hate like most other adventurers do (from both subreddits).

 It can be funny to make fun of the holocaust. But I gotta say I don't find this very tasteful. You're comparing saving tortured people by spending money to saving more bitcoin by spending money. And the joke isn't even focused on the comparison, it's focused on the fact that in both scenarios the subject is sad for not spending more. But that's me.

If you owned bitcoin before the fork in the beginning of August, you have a volume of BCC equivalent to the amount of BTC you own. Depending on where you store your coins (exchange or wallet), there are different steps you will need to take to access it. 
For example, the people that use Electrum need to create a second seed and transfer their funds over, consequently leaving nothing but the BCC in the original. 
If you use Coinbase as your method of storage, you are SOL and must wait until 2018 to collect your BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:20:02
Lol that is one of the worst traits in people. The ones that refuse to examine their lives in a different light after they are confronted with a "what if" moment. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:24:53
You definitely can, there's no harm in sending your BTC from Coinbase to a private wallet. Keep in mind, however, that your BCC will stay behind. Coinbase has control of your private keys, so until they  support BCC trading they will freeze your stash until further notice. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:37:01
No need to get upset. I'm one person that presented my one opinion in a respectful way. If you don't like it that's okay. But that doesn't make my subjective perspective wrong.

Did you only have a penny's worth in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:33:12
I highly recommend starting with the Coinbase exchange. The transaction fees are pretty high, but the interface is the most approachable. If I were you I would apply for an account asap since they can take weeks to confirm your bank account and personal info before you can buy.
As for an explanation of what bitcoin is, I'll leave that to the others to explain. Or you can google it, as this question has been asked multiple times and I'm sure you could find a thread somewhere with minimal searching efforts. All I can really say articulately is that bitcoin removes the need for the government to be involved with our money, as it is decentralized (you are your own bank) and has solved the quintessential issue that has plagued all digital monies before its time: no amount can ever be re-spent, thus eliminating the worry that bitcoin can be "broken" as only a finite amount of supply can ever exist and cannot be altered.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:27:25
To me it isn't a question of whether they can (which no doubt they could), but if it's illegal. Because if it is, then comcast and the others could be prosecuted in the court of law, thus discouraging them since I'm sure that'd cost them quite a bit of money and power if they were to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:59
I can definitely see how people can have issues with the company. But since I use the app strictly to buy bitcoin in bulk once a month and I immediately move my purchase to a hardware wallet to hodl, I've never had a problem personally. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:22:00
- anything where you own your private keys
- you can't make a wrong choice
- anything where you own your private keys
- it should work, so something's wrong
- I suppose
- if you have your private keys and you're using a trusted wallet, it's real
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:07:36
It's if you converted $20,000 or more from btc to cash, and it only applies to accounts reaching up until the end of 2015.

Can the ISPs actually block sites in the US? I thought they could only control your internet speeds so they can put faster speeds behind paywalls.

I did that with bitcoin cash, for reasons this subreddit knows too well. But bitcoin gold isn't supposed to be a competitor to BTC, and is more in line with ETH. Personally I wouldn't sell until I see it play out more. 
(I'm open to discussion so if anyone disagrees I'd like to hear their opinion on bitcoin gold)
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:32:36
Huh, I wonder what price you bought in then! Bc anyone who bought as late as summer 2016 would have the same amount as you rn.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:05:58
Sure. I don't think your analogy fits here, and I'll explain. You're right that the robber and the victim are not your fault or responsibility, and it's morally justifiable to want to protect yourself and your property. 
However, the IRS does not threaten your life, and it's also not interested in taking everything you have. Why are the others unable to save themselves in your robbery hypothetical? I don't see how having a full year to approach your tax scenario equates to the split-second you have to decide what to do when a gun is in your face.
Whether we like it or not, we grew up on our home soil. For me, at least, that's America. I used their schools, roads, services, cables, trains, buildings, etc. All of which wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the help of taxes. By not doing my part to society, I'm contributing to making the next generation disadvantaged by not allowing my country to continue expanding and improving. 
I hate the idea of giving my hard-earned money away, but it's unfortunately necessary. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:38:37
LOL the mere fact that you put yourself before others, PLUS go out and say you're also more valuable has got to be the most narcissistic comment in all these threads.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:56:21
I guess all I can think to say is that even though the money they take has a significant chance of being misused, that's more of a reflection of the current state of the government if the money flow from taxes isn't utilized in the most efficient way manageable. We need better and smarter people in the government that know what they're doing and how to avoid misusing precious taxpayers money. 
But what if we didn't pay taxes until a better system was put in place? Ideally that sounds great, but we would be dooming the current state and guaranteeing its failure. Starting over is never as good of an idea as it sounds. 
Or, since money is the root of everything, would it actually have the opposite effect and cause policies to feverishly change in order to get the influx of tax money back on track? But then, if taxes are optional when you disagree with the money's use, would ANYBODY ever pay taxes?
Also, in America the tax bracket is 37% if you make $500,000+ annually. Despite everything I said, that's an incredibly large deduction!
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:18:48
That's poppycock. Coming from someone who had bitcoin STOLEN from me, the government only covered 10% of my losses.

 If you haven't made any changes since this guy made his comment, I really don't see any issue. Looks great as it is. Would love a graph though!

 I'm not pissed at all at the US government. If anything, I appreciate what little they did. All I'm pointing out is that if you expect the government to cover 100% of your losses you're an idiot. And I would explain my situation to you but you started this chain of comments with attitude so I doubt you'd really care at all about me.

The problem was that it takes 7 years to grow them. People would place orders literally years in advance, and the complexity of meeting in taverns to buy and sell contracts between multiple people combined with the issue of no government regulation or record-keeping caused the investors to sell and back out of the market.
