Open a pseudo-exchange. I live in Sweden, and getting BTC here is a pain in the arse (thanks, banks!). One (very friendly) person opened up btcx.se. He buys in bulk from mt gox and sells it for SEK, and takes a profit. Great idéa, and good for us who don't want to do a lot of bank-work to get it done.

And then, a hundred years after we die, it will be a great adventure. Just imagine
***Indiana Jones and the mystery of the forgotten private key***
Where the catholic church is in ruins, and the secret to their big stash of btc is painted on the walls of Notre Dame. But there is one missing piece. 
This fall, embark on an adventure never imagined, as *Indy*^tm fight the Nazi-Communists to save Jesus Christ. In a cinema, near you.

No, we don't vote for a "four year dictator". In countries with "winner-takes-it-all"-systems they do (like the presidential election in the US) but that is obviously flawed. Still better than dictatorship though.

NP mate! Just doing the mods jobs, since they arent :)

Don't expect to earn anything by doing this. Bitcoins are fun, exciting and an amazing technology, but to speculate on them in both hard and unwise. Invest your money in a global fund or something that has been preven to work instead. 
But of course you should own some bitcoins and spend them!

Yeah you tinfoils can go on all you want, but in democracies we choose our rulers. It's true, I promise.

Agreed, but there are inappropriate reddits for a submission, and subreddits where the mods filter out off topic and inappropriate links are better. Simply because they are more on topic. 
Over at [they always complain about memes and cheap-karma-links "taking" over reddits as they grow, and even if they exaggerate there is some thruth in that. 
Source: I've also been a redditor for years! (even if this is a newer account). And information about what silk road is not really relevant in [but very relevant in [Ergo, it should be posted there, not here. Just as puns should not be posted in [and rage comics should not be submitted to [&gt; Mod's job is mostly preventing spam. Actual content filtering is done via down and up voting. There are some themed subreddits which implement stricter content filtering by mods, but it's not according to the original idea of reddit. 
I don't agree. I think spam is not only obvious spam, but also low-quality links and off-topic ones. 
But of course I get your point too, so please don't take me as yet another troll.

Well, it's not mathematical security but security as trust (Bruce Schneider talks about theese things is his latest digest, very interesting as always) but it has sufficed with non-crypto money for a long time so why wouldnt it work as good with cryptocash?
But I understand, I also feel uncomfortable with having to trust in a person what I could have trusted to cryptography, but I guess that's how it is.

Yeah, you internet guys can suck it, I just called you tinfoils! Haha! I win the argument!
They represent the people a thousand times better than any other political system. But I agree that the decisions could and should be takes even closer to the people who are affected by them. That is more power to the local government and less to the central government.

Yeah, having a donation adress would maybe work. But shameless self-promotion on reddit is kind of frowned upon. 
Just a friendly reminder on the subject of internet etiquette! 
@_date: 2012-04-18 19:09:51
Well, are we really sure that botnets are that good? Many people don't have drivers compatible with bitcoin mining, and botnet operators have to struggle with security tools (even computer illiterates use antiviruses and automatic updates these days!). These facts make botnet bitcoin mining a lot less profitable than one would think at first glance. 
To set up a GPU/FGPA farm on the other hand does not require coding clever solutions to security measures (i.e. less time-consuming), and may very well be more effective.
But what do I know, I neither mine bitcoins or write botnets!

Well of course? But why would anyone do that, except for fun?
We who only sell things on occasion use out phones. They already come with NFC, a screen for viewing price/qr and bitcoin clients (well, that last one we download). 
Professionals would not hack together their own registrar (what taxation department would allow that?), and the companies who would make bitcoin-ready cash registrars would probarbly hack together something even cheaper. The Raspberry Pi is a all-purpose machine, and that would be a waste for someone only needing a singe-purpose computer.

Hey everyone, this is only half-true. Electrum offers a way to 'convert' the private key (that is gibberish to human brains) into english words that one may remember. But you still need to remember it. And it's foolish to now back it up somewhere outside of your house. 
Stranger things than amnesia has happened. 
Stranger things than your laptop burning has happened. 
Be safe, and have fun!

I'm sorry to break it, but banks wont run any better or worse with bitcoins, so how is this ot?
No karma for you! 
@_date: 2012-04-01 15:13:30
Well, that depends on what kind of constitution you have. 
Some countries (like the US where many redditors live!) have a "winner takes it all"-system. Other countries, like most ones (I think, I am not absolutely sure! Most european countries are like this), have a proportional system where if party x gets 15% of votes, they also get 15% of the power. In these countries many small parties can form a majority, and thus this kind of parliament is more representative of it's people. 
In Schweiz they make most of the decisions on a very local level (instead of having it the way we in the EU have it - where the european parliament decides for us and many are unhappy with it), with people voting in their community for many laws, not just electing representatives for them. This "true" democracy on the other hand leads to backwards laws, like they didn't want voting rights for women until the late half of the 20'th century. 
But even if I also agree that bitcoin is exciting and a fantastic tool, we all know democracies are good things and work better than their alternatives.

A central bank is not the same thing as an usual bank. 
The central bank is the one that prints money, often controlled by the government (in democracies that means the people). They work kind of the same way as bitcoin miners do, but they don't use GPU's but money printing machines. 
They lend that money to "usual" banks who then lend it to joe schmoe who wants to start a business or buy a house or something.
