There's an ethereum dapp called ethlance.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:14:04
Might be the latter.

I usually go with the lock and key analogy. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:08
Then you should be fine. Just don't download fake/rogue/phishing BCC client and use your private key to claim them. Refer to

I'd love to read your article published on Forbes. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:33:28
I KYC'd pretty hard.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:50:00
Relax mate, did you backup your private key?
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:33:01
I regularly send international wire transfers and it still takes 3 - 5 business days + outgoing wire transfer fee on my side + incoming wire fee on receiver's side which amounts to total fucking bullshit in 2019.

It's not my bank, it's all of them. Mine is in the image.

Write a medium post or something. It would be a great help for the community.

I would disagree because Satoshi as an entity did bless us with what is now known as [Nakamoto consensus](

Gizmodo made me cringe real hard. How come people who don't know shit about Bitcoin get to write about it on a big publication like Gizmodo?

I'm a simple man, I see Andreas getting recommended, I upvote. Also if you're into reading OP, The internet of money is a good one.

Thank you that's really helpful. My ETA keeps on increasing and now I'm worried that the TX might get dropped. How long before a TX is dropped from mempool?

I wish they would use a blockchain based solution to store citizen data securely.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:45:41
What does this has to do with Bitcoin though?

Say you have solar panels in your home, you can store that energy and chose to sell it to the grid network and in turn receive value that you can either turn into cash or use to buy electricity. That's what a Consensys project Grid+ is planning on doing.

Do you sell ATM or the sign itself?

Only about 1% people pay taxes in India so I think taxes are least of their concerns. I believe this is due to either 
* The RBI planning to launch their own crypto currency.
* Or supporting something like JioCoin, to be launched by the close friend of India's ruling party

There's an awesome YouTube channel called Coldfusion which made a couple of videos explaining how the banking system and money in general works and how Bitcoin is disrupting this millennia old system.

Here's a playlist with all their finance videos:
