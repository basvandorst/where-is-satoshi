TL;DR summary needed

Time to buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:25:21
Welp that's already outdated...
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:36:22
Bitcoin itself can't be in a bubble as it's continuing to work as designed, and still has a set limit to how many will be available. What's happening is a mania to obtain Bitcoin which is thus driving up the price. Even if the mania results in a hard crash eventually, Bitcoin will continue to function as it did before and during the mania.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:01:29
Well Roger Ver just triggered...
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:30:36
File under things people regret saying.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:26:58
It's entering a mania right now, not a bubble. Subtle distinction.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:39:43
Completely agree. Authy is not good two-factor identification because it's attached to your phone number (if you're using the google authenticator function inside of it, that can be fine, but that's not what they are using).
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:14:20
I agree that this is a win for bitcoin. ApplePay (and whatever else exists for Android/Windows phone) is just an important interim step, but will help people get used to paying with their mobile computing devices. Once that's ingrained, moving to bitcoin or an app like Casheer, is just the next logical step.
@_date: 2014-04-19 06:42:10
Wow, they really are idiots at engadget arent' they. Sad.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:04:50
Yup - the floor for bitcoin was already established at about $400 earlier this year, so really this is just another buying opportunity.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:42:27
Yeah I'm doing the same except that our 32 panel system powers our whole home including my modest mining efforts.
@_date: 2014-06-05 09:31:11
Your wife is awesome!
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:35:31
Don’t forget to pay taxes if you sell some. It’s a huge bummer but better do it upfront than end up owing money you don’t have.
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:24:38
Well duh
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:01:04
So just to be clear Apple wasn't hacked it was a social engineering issue and bad passwords, lack of 2nd factor authentication, etc. In other words the same issues that any cloud service has. To compare this to their ApplePay is just plain stupid.
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:41:29
More like late '94
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:36:48
Nothing technically, but it would be the first time they've created anything for Android.
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:46:28
True but by that time Windows was clearly the winner. I don't think Apple is ready to admit defeat to Android yet, and they shouldn't. All the Android phone makers except Samsung make no money on their phones, and the new iPhone 6 and 6+ are aimed directly at Samsung. Plus it's far easier for an Android user to switch to iOS than the other way around.
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:40:04
Yeah, screw you!
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:21:42
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:10:10
True, but I don't think it will matter. The real win for the consumer is that now that iOS and Android can both be used to pay via NFC, and over the internet, merchants can safely and happily install the needed back end along with the NFC machines in retail, to simplify transactions. Customers can use their payment method of choice, and in the end, crypto-currencies will be the next logical step, or perhaps simply an additional option.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:37:05
Wow that's crazy. I just started using Coinbase today. I hope my bank account doesn't get frozen, like yours (although I have a different bank). California (where I live) just voted CryptoCurrency to be legal, so how do they justify this?
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:47:49
Considering the disaster in Japan, nuclear is a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:46:59
I have solar and it's saving me money already.
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:17:42
I would argue that Fission based plants that produce nuclear waste are a bad idea no matter where they are built.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:13:55
I think Bitcoin itself will become the world reserve currency and thus an excellent Store of value, but I think Lightning networks and alt coins will be used for the daily stuff. It's still way too hard for a normal consumer to use Bitcoin for purchases, but that too will change.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:12:37
One and a half and growing, but I'm right there with ya!
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:32:28
God this kills me. I heard of bitcoin years back, but was too slow to get into it. Congrats on becoming a millionaire man. Spend it wisely.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:23:03
I don't get it. Did somebody hide their private key in an old toaster?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:06:59
No it's not too late. We're still in the early adopter phase, but the early majority adoption phase will begin soon, and that's where the truly explosive growth will happen. Then it will slow down (but still increase) as the late majority phase of adoption begins. Finally laggards will adopt Crypto and it will be like smart phones - ubiquitous.
@_date: 2016-06-11 18:33:25
I'd like something like this that removes adds as well. For example you could set up an account somewhere and there would be a standard fee each time you visit a webpage, in exchange no adds would be shown. If there aren't enough funds then you would see adds and get a reminder to fund your account. Would require something like the automated machinery in ether to do though.
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:32:57
It’s honestly the primary reason. When I’ve done it - it works great. But no one will do it regularly when it’s a tax nightmare to think about all the transactions and gains/losses you have to track.
@_date: 2018-10-15 05:03:10
No do t do this. I missed out a bunch of money in January because I was like a dear in the headlights and was afraid to pay a lot of tax. Just overpay the tax and then wait to get it back later once you’ve got time to get all your records straight. Always wise to sell some on new ATHs.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:17:07
If you can hold it for three years or more I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.��
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:21:04
Bitcoin is a store of value and the world's reserve currency. If it _is_ used for everyday transactions at all it will be through a lightning settlement network and/or through atomic swaps with other currencies. This is not failure!
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:58:29
Wait until it's worth more than the median annual salary in America!
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:15:10
Their greed will overcome that eventually.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:16:23
It'll move back
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:21:48
It's already on the way to becoming the world's reserve currency. So I'd say it doesn't really have to be mainstream anymore. If it becomes the new default you store your money in, and use to access your money anywhere in the world, that's good enough. Of course that will have a dramatic impact on the price, but it doesn't have to be used to buy a Big Mac to be "mainstream".
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:32:35
LOL So true!
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:59:09
I don't know. It's looking like support is building around the $4k level. I kind of doubt it will break below that easily anytime soon (maybe ever if it really takes off).
@_date: 2019-10-28 06:14:31
Welcome to crypto. Enjoy the crazy ride.
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:15:30
The definition of “permisionless”
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:21:25
There should be some reward for node validators.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:19:58
So they moved it forward? It was going to open tomorrow originally.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:26:19
But not everyone runs a node or can run a node, so who do you trust? The nodes should be rewarded for being honest players and as a way to counter the power of miners who try to game the system.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:53:44
With SegWit activated though the importance of proper node validation has increased and the motives of bad actors to collude with miners could be a real problem. Having a small monetary reward for good actors to participate could mitigate this.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:49:08
Should be go Keto not go vegan.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:09:52
Great article. I believe it makes sense as the default option.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:39:24
Turn at least some of that into passive income. I suggest buying a duplex outright or paying it off over a few years if you want to spread it out for tax reasons, and then hiring a management company to rent the two units out. Buy a house outright as well but not too big and fancy then you’re biggest monthly expense (housing) is tiny, and the monthly income from the rentals might actually be enough to live off if you keep your life simple (obviously eliminate all other debt as well), or at least one income would be enough. Also don’t sell all the BTC. Keep some of it since greater gains are most likely ahead in the long term at least. You might also want to look into SALT for a loan backed by your BTC so you can keep more of it and let it grow in value over time (like equity on a house). Oh and congrats!
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:22:42
So everyone who believe in $crypto should really switch banks in protest. Bank of America is a terrible bank anyway, but if they lose enough customers it will send a message.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:37:12
Like I said I'm happy for you and there was definitely a lot of risk. I'm just pointing out that you had a lot to invest to begin with.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:01:05
More like a rumor.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:15:56
So you have $84,000 to invest? I'm happy for you, but you obviously weren't poor to begin with.
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:31:50
Buy the one on the right, so you can afford a lifetime supply of the ones on the left as it appreciates in value.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:09:33
Should be interesting to see vengeful traders crash their economy.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:33:41
Nodes should be getting some kind of reward for acting as validators and strengthening the network. Not as much as miners, but there should be something.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:00:50
Pffft that'll happen in 2018.
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:10:43
I'm just keeping it. It'll probably be one of those weird things you get nostalgic about years from now, like "remember when..."
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:16:20
Yes. Do not use.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:28:01
Yes but you shouldn't be investing in Crypto unless you are highly risk tolerant and can handle the volatility. Index funds are the antithesis of Crypto in that they distribute risk and make steady gains over the long term.
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:03:53
Perfect example of why Bitcoin has a LONG way to go for normal people.
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:37:23
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:15:34
Lol �� 
@_date: 2016-05-29 15:58:28
This is pretty much true for people who aren't naturally curious or into technology in my experience, although the cutoff age is definitely higher than 35.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:13:39
Exactly. Bitcoin is compared to gold but gold _sucks_ as an actual currency, which is why we don't use it for that anymore. Gold _is_ a good store of value and I think Bitcoin will continue to be that, but it's a disaster in terms of flexibility. Side chains won't cut it for important new features, so I see Bitcoin as MasterCard - still a big player but eclipsed by Visa in the long run. The question is - who will be Visa? And American Express and Discover? There's room for more than one to succeed. And good luck getting smart contracts to work on Bitcoin. So many reasons why this article is wrong. Yes Bitcoin has the network effect, and the name recognition, but that doesn't make it insurmountable.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:47:57
A healthy correction. Sanity returning to the market. This is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:22:45
He's not wrong
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:31:16
Seems about right actually. Assuming Bitcoin doesn't destroy itself before then.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:34:13
He's a fool.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:35:39
True 2fa should be required
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:53:31
That’s what people where saying who didn’t own any Bitcoin last year this time.
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:10:14
Ugh. That's not the sort of headlines you want to see. People are going to do stupid things and then contribute to a crash at the first serious down turn.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:11:30
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:14:23
Never had a single issue with them.
