Can confirm that 3-5sat transactions are clearing: my donation to Andreas from Dec 6 finally went through this morning, and it had a 5-sat/b fee.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:36:55
Well, alright.
Just remember that we've had protracted periods of loss before: people who bought in at the 2013 ATH didn't recover from the crash until this January, four years later.
If you can cover the payments on that loan for four years, sure, have fun.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:05:59
I've seen that happen with my CC before, where a transaction will be pending for a few days, then appear in the confirmed list before it leaves the pending list, so it's duplicated for a day or so.
Should sort itself out by Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:25:13
I panic sold during the initial rise, and the price still hasn't dipped to where I can buy back in, so I commiserate.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:54:30
The network itself is almost ready, we're told it'll be in public test by the end of Q1. So yeah, the system is waiting on tools and implementation.
I'm reading through *Mastering Bitcoin* and the Segwit Developer's Guide right now, maybe I can make some use out of this.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:12:18
Let me know if you need any help with other shops, and/or a flat CMS-less integration; we PHP devs should band together to help out where we can :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:00:24
Andreas has more recent photos on his site, but no licensing information attached. I'd wait until he's back, before running it past him.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:44:40
I don't know if you're being facetious, but it says "Exciting news from Chain". Might look like *China*, but isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:08:47
Bitcoin is in a process of continual upgrade to the software. Sometimes the upgrade introduces a backwards-compatible feature (like the segregated-witness transaction format), and sometimes a new version would break compatibility (SegWit2x is an example). A compatibility-breaking upgrade is a hard fork: any blocks produced by the new software cannot be integrated into the existing blockchain, so they run off on their own branch and create a new coin.
The SegWit2x hard fork didn't happen, but coins like BGold and BCash have arisen from this process. They don't affect Bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:17:10
It's up here, trades are still happening.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:35:53
Darn it, you're not supposed to tell people ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:03:27
Alright, do you have a fuller list of projects that need help? I looked at c-lightning's issues list, but nothing on there seemed actionable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:50
Alright, added a section on *Mastering Bitcoin* and *The Internet of Money*. I might trawl the YouTube and pull a list of conferences at which talks have been given.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:51:06
Indeed, this is always a possibility. Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, and if it takes 3 hours to generate a block... It could take a long time to come down.
Of course, the chances of that happening are low.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:15
Not only did I miss the fire sale, my sale kickstarted this rise: I sold at EUR 10192, and it's been green candles ever since.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:27:45
I'm a mod over at and we started instituting flairs a few weeks ago. It's great: now you can filter out shitposts, or drill down to focus on climate-related stories or societal collapse discussion.
I can recommend the use of post flairs, especially `Low quality`.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:26:41
Heh, I sent a donation to Andreas (with a low fee) on the 6th, and it's still in the mempool. I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:52:51
So the article runs up until the Canadian Senate appearance. What are some significant appearances since then? I can trawl the YouTube channel for conference keynotes, and there're the JRE shows of course, but anything else of note?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:36
Yesterday I cashed out at 10k EUR, to clear some of my CC before the crash.
Weak hand over here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:27
And added a list of presentations for which I could find event pages and dates. Here's hoping Wikipedia allow for YouTube links.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:13
No, 1mBTC is a huge fee. You should be fine in the next day or two.
Whereas my fee was 0.015 mBTC. I expect that transaction to never go through.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:51:44
Hey, look at that. It is actually a different symbol, \u20BF.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:29:24
Difficulty can adjust up or down: there's a limit (I seem to recall it being 4%) on each adjustment, but the direction's no matter. If much of the hashing power vanishes, we'll have a slow few months before the difficulty adjustments knock it down enough to be sensible again.
If like 99% of the hashing power vanishes (which is frankly unlikely) this mechanism still operates, but block times get _very_ long.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:14
I'm waiting for Jan 3rd, to see if Bitcoin is on the Times front page eight years after the genesis block. That'd be quite something.

LN is currently in test, and bugs are being found and worked on. It's expected that the network will hit mainnet in 3-6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:12:03
I know, right. Maybe if OP threw in two extra spares of every component, including engines, so the buyer could make it to the end of the street.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:35:50
I'm hoping that we see a return to 10k/10500 today, and then back on the moonward trajectory to 20k by Jan.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:14:03
Let's be fair, that's Thai baht.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:10:48
So you may recall that I sold at €10k. It turns out that I haven't withdrawn the fiat from the exchange yet, so... buy back in?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:13:59
Unfortunately, I'm also a webdev with some background in low-level/embedded, so I'm more in need of ideas right now ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:55:49
As I've heard it told elsewhere, CSW is the only person in the world who's definitively not Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:44:44
Oh shit, we just blew through the €10k wall. 10,100 now, and no slowing down!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:40
Hold on now. I can't use my VPS as a Bitcoin node, because it doesn't have space to store the blockchain; would that also be a limitation for an LN node?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:05
Heh, and here I've been spending the last couple of days getting a mainnet node spun up. Is it testnet nodes that are needed right now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:26
So we're getting close to the point where cashing out half my coin would pay off my CC. Given that: is it an honorable cashing-out if the fiat is used to pay down debts?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:14:59
So that's what, three independent tipbots being worked on now. It's high time that we had the tipping culture return, honestly.

Standard transposition error: "be", "can". Interesting that it happened only on the first word of the sentence...
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:12:17
A block can contain only so many transactions, and the miners will prefer to take fees from high-fee-paying transactions first. By the time a block gets mined, there are almost always enough transactions paying more than 5 sat/b to fill a block, and the "bedrock" of below-5-sat doesn't get chewed into.
Here's hoping LN can help alleviate the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:56:11
has a... relationship with the phrase "two weeks", so I don't know that I'd trust that timescale ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:14
So c-lightning requires a running caught-up copy of bitcoind, so that's out; the other implementations surely require the same?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:52:56
You can send a QR etched into metal, like the ones they sell at Bitkee: it can have no distinguishing marks except the QR, if you like, or it can be etched with "Bitcoin". If you're paying the carriage costs, I see no reason that'd be refused.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:59:38
No link, just the fact that it was 3-6 months after Segwit that LN hit full integration-test pass, so it's likely to be a similar timescale to iron out what's left.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:54:05
Except by then all your stuff's been taken, with no chance of getting it back and no redress.

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:15:27

The rationale I've seen expressed on here, is that if Gox goes under it becomes a matter of how do you get even a percentage of your money back.
If all your funds are locked in Gox, in BTC, they can just run away with it since the law hasn't formulated a credit obligation yet. If your funds are locked in Gox, in dollars, there are fiduciary obligations in bankruptcy that apply.

Another quote that seems pertinent:


This is the case for the fiat, debt-created money described in Baker's speech. Whereas we've already seen with Bitcoin, if an early miner cashes out their coin is distributed in an exchange among anyone willing to pick it up. In the case of the bearwhale, I was one of those who chipped away at the wall, and I'm definitely a "late owner" in relation to Bitcoin's lifespan thus far.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:52:07
If I recall, BitPay gives you the option to hodl your received coin, as opposed to cashing it out to fiat immediately.
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:25:58
The argument being that all other currencies generally have a hundred divisions to their base unit. $2.98, £39,999.95 and so forth.
Whereas with Bitcoin as it is now, you have to quote a price as 0.0037815 BTC. That price in bits would be 3,781.50 which fits more into the format expected by use of other currencies.

The "21-million club" is for people who have at least one bitcoin (one 21-millionth of the eventual supply). It's named such because it can only ever have 21M members, if all the coin was evenly distributed.
Conversely, the "1-million" club can only ever have 1M members, and you qualify by having at least 21BTC.

Yep, it's great. When I flew out to Vancouver (for two weeks), I decided to try staying there in cash/BTC alone: I didn't even inform my bank that I was flying out. It was exactly this point that I wished to avoid, that I'd have to prove that my money was mine to some random guy down the phone in a different country.
Worked fine: I had enough cash for one week, and hit up an ATM in the city to cash out enough coin for my second week. As you say, no-one can lock you out of cash, and that holds for Bitcoin just as it does for fiat, if not more so.

Oh, but it does. Civil forfeiture means the police can take anything of yours, at any time.

Civil forfeiture is a procedure in US law that states, if the police have suspicion that your stuff has been used in a crime, they can seize it. They don't need to tell you what the crime is, of course, or the reason for their suspicion.
John Oliver covered it a few months back: 
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:53:00

Can never go wrong with some Andreas. I should buy his book sometime.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:10:31
There's a chance, but it's expected that more than one second has passed while you've been twiddling `nonce` and `extraNonce`, so the timestamp field comes into play. You'd also expect a transaction to have come through, so the Merkle hash changes too.
That widens the solution space out by a fair bit.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:38:36
I'm not au fait with how the code looks, but it seems like a lot of work to go re-ordering transactions within the block. Wouldn't surprise me if it was a last-resort solution though.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:44:33
Yep. When you buy a "mining kit", all you get is a pad and paper, and a book explaining how to perform SHA-256 hash rounds by hand.
It can get... tedious.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:59:56
The timestamp field is defined as a Unix time value: number of seconds since 00:00 UTC on Jan 1 1970. Since it's UTC, one can reasonably expect to source that time from the Network Time Protocol, which is maintained against atomic clocks around the world.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:00:59
It was a thought in the back of my mind, actually: what goes into a block, what does a transaction look like, etc. I suspect it'd be a more complicated topic to cover well, though; also, I'm not nearly so up to scratch with the cryptographic signing used, and one would have to go right back to PKI and large primes to make sense of it...
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:27:02
Oh, NTP is a world unto itself. Here's the [list of Stratum-1 time servers]( which are the primary sources; there are universities, military installations and private companies on the list.
NTP gets used for a lot more than just Bitcoin, as you can imagine: it's an authoritative source of an answer to "what time is it".
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:43:35
As far as I'm aware, that's how the difficulty adjustment works: the code is aware of the average time between blocks, so it divides that into the desired 600 seconds and that becomes a multiplier to the new target.
Strategies for the nonce differ; I could swear I've seen miners that just go up from zero, and that'd probably make most sense so you're sure that you're not re-using values. I'm not familiar with the implementation details of the miners, but I expect some do pluck random numbers and just write off any duplicates as (small amounts of) wasted work.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:49:16

The numerical result of the hash. It's one giant number, after all, and you can do comparisons against that.
Increasing the difficulty increases the divisor mentioned [above]( which makes the target smaller. A smaller target is more difficult to reach.

Well, no.

Whereas I've had a transaction with a 50-cent fee waiting for a whole day now: 
Actually literally 24 hours ago, still hasn't made it into a block yet.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:55:39
Coins are introduced into the network with each block, by a "coinbase" transaction (of which there can only be one per block), and then circulates as a series of transfers. The process I outlined is the reason coin isn't duplicated: only one block ever gets accepted as the next in the chain.
The database of blocks and transactions is decentralized: if you turn off some of the computers in the network, the rest of the net will just process transactions more slowly, for a while, until the difficulty adjusts to compensate. Bitcoin is resilient in that way.
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:38:09
The difficulty is often expressed as a divisor: given the largest number you can fit in 256 bits (which is some stupid figure like 1x10^(73)) the mining target (as of right now) needs to be below:
        2^256
    ------------
    317688400354
Which is [3.644 x 10^65]( still a stupendously large number. You can imagine that if difficulty moves by a few percent every two weeks, the divisor isn't going to get near the numerator for a very long time.
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:31:49
Here's a table for the last [couple of years]( of difficulty changes; you can see the occasional negative percentage where the network has lost some computers, and it's taken slightly longer than two weeks to reach a difficulty change. For example, 18 Jul to 2 Aug 2016 was a gap of fifteen days.
You'll also see back in 2014, the proliferation of SHA256-mining chips caused huge jumps in difficulty for months on end, the largest being 18 Jun to 29 Jun 2014: only eleven days to reach 2,016 blocks, and a difficulty change of +25% to compensate.
To your other question, computers on the network don't check with each other every time they come up with a solution. That would severely limit the amount of work they're able to do per second; you can buy desktop machines that'll do billions of these hashes per second, and there's no way you could check all of those with the network even given the largest pipe in the world.
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:59:22

Issuance of new coins is actually entirely separate from this proof-of-work mechanism: each new block has a coin-generation transaction, and the amount of coin in that transaction is halved every four years. We're now in the era of 12.5 BTC blocks; in 2020, that'll reduce to 6.25, and so on.
In 2140 or so, the coin-generation will have halved to such an extent that no new coin is generated; that's where you get the 21M limit.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:47:59
So, hold on. I see that the third ever Segwit transaction was to an address starting with 3. Do all Segwit transactions have to go to addresses starting 3? If I send transactions from my Mycelium (HD wallet with a current address starting 1) will it count as Segwit? Will it be rejected from a larger block as non-Segwit?
These questions are probably answered elsewhere, but I haven't found a single source that contains all this information.

If you had no proof of work, and just verified every transaction as its own block as it came in, you'd end up with a rapidly fragmenting network. For example, if a transaction is made in India and Indian miners immediately generate a block for it, that'll propagate out as a new block. At the same time, the transaction itself will propagate and miners in (say) China and Turkey will generate their own blocks: some will be at the same height as the ones coming across the network from India, and some will already have seen the block from India and be generating blocks with one more height.
Proof of work, as I understand it, lets you synchronize the network on the same blockchain without having to worry about propagation delays making two or three new chains. (In theory, if two miners find a new block at the exact same time, you'd get two competing chains being built, but this has worked itself out on the few occasions it's occurred, and the network has settled on one chain.)
You may notice that other cryptocurrencies have different block times, but they never go below one minute or so, since you still want to avoid those propagation delays.

I followed the rabbit-hole a bit, and landed at this book: 
In which "double SHA-256" is discussed as a way to prevent attacks on SHA-256 from affecting your hashing algorithm. There's a known advantage to running multiple rounds of a hashing or encrypting algorithm (see `bcrypt` which is recommended for multi-round hashing of passwords for storage in a database).
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:57:33
The nonce is a 32-bit number, so it can have one of four billion values. There's also an extraNonce that can be futzed with elsewhere in the block, in case none of the four billion combinations yield a small enough hash; that's another 32 bits.

That's fine: the private key is just a random number, it can start with any digit (0-9, A-F).
It may actually be helpful if you count up the number of digits in your decoded version: a compressed WIF of version `80` should be 76 digits. If it's something else, then version `85` does things significantly differently.

Transaction fees on a blockchain are dependent on the "size" of the transaction (the physical number of bytes used to refer to the inputs and outputs). You'll sometimes see fees priced in "satoshis per byte" for that reason.

So here's a base58 converter: 
If you plug your compressed-WIF into the middle boxes (Base58 address decoder), you should get something like this:
    KxFC1jmwwCoACiCAWZ3eXa96mBM6tb3TYzGmf6YwgdGWZgawvrtJ  
    801E99423A4ED27608A15A2616A2B0E9E52CED330AC530EDCC32C8FFC6A526AEDD017695738B  
    ^ ^                                                               ^ ^  
    | |                                                               | |  
    | Private key (raw hex)                                           | Checksum  
    Version                                                           "Compress" flag
(That private key is from *Mastering Bitcoin*, don't worry, it's not mine.)
Note that you have the `80` at the start, then the rest of the string. If you're reporting version 133, your string will start `85`. The good news is that you can get your key out of there: it's the "raw hex" in the example above.
From there, you can in theory rebuild an uncompressed key. Let me know how you get on.
*Edit*: Here's a bit of PHP code which will take your recovered private key hex and build an uncompressed private key you can plug back into the base58 encoder:
    $key = '1E99423A4ED27608A15A2616A2B0E9E52CED330AC530EDCC32C8FFC6A526AEDD';
    $key = '80' . $key;
    $first_hash = hash('sha256', pack('H*', $key));
    $second_hash = hash('sha256', pack('H*', $first_hash));
    echo $key, strtoupper(substr($second_hash, 0, 8)), "
";

If you're plugging a private raw key into bitaddress, I think you'd need to take the ten numbers at the end off, as well: the block starting `01`.

Sure, I occasionally check in on my cold store by pulling up its balance in a public explorer like Bitpay Insight.
Personally, I've used [Bitkee]( for cold store wallets: they take a BIP38-encrypted private key (so they can't get access to your coins) and etch it into a credit-card-sized piece of stainless steel (or titanium, your choice). [Cryptosteel]( offer a similar service. Disadvantage: if you ever pull your coins out of cold store and only spend some of them, you'll need to get a new Bitkee etched. Advantage: it's a physical "paper wallet" (except in metal) that'll survive fire, flood and other natural disasters.
Others may recommend Trezor or Ledger as coldstores, but I prefer something with no electronics.

If you're looking to use Bitcoin, you should use Namecheap for domains: they take Bitcoin for domain and SSL certificate payments.
As for taking payment yourself, it depends on whether you want to take them directly or through a third party like Bitpay or Coinbase; the third-party solutions are, of course, easiler to set up since they provide an API and a neat interface. To make your own payment infrastructure, you'll need to run a full Bitcoin node alongside your site, and ask it for addresses to which your customers can send payments (generating a new address per invoice, for order tracking purposes).

Not only is this a possible attack, it's what's been happening the last few months. The man behind Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of mining equipment, found a hole in the algorithm (referred to as AsicBoost) that meant his equipment could gain an advantage in the mining race. That led to all kinds of shenanigans in an attempt to keep that advantage:
- Lobbying against improvements to Bitcoin;
- Filling up the unconfirmed-transactions pool so payments take forever to process;
- Trying to get the mining community to work on a different coin instead;
- Pumping the price of the new coin by throwing piles of money at it.
After all that, the software developers behind the new coin gave up on it, the coin never launched, and Bitcoin hit unheard-of highs in value. So Bitcoin survived the attack, as it's survived everything else so far.
Hope that helps.

There is the theoretical possibility that a customer could "send you coins" by telling your node that they have authorised a transaction, and then immediately turn around and broadcast a different transaction using the same coins. You wouldn't know which of those transactions would be "real" until one was mined into a block.
This actually happened to someone who posted here [just a few minutes ago]( they bought some Bitcoin from _some guy_, who sent the transaction to Blocktrail but sent a different transaction to the rest of the network.

The transaction structures get increasingly complicated with Segwit and layer-2 solutions. In these couple of minutes, Andreas mentions a Lightning channel which would normally need monitoring to ensure it's not closed without the consent of both ends, and then Segwit comes in, so you get:
- The Bitcoin base blockchain;
- The Lightning channel opened thereupon;
- A Segwit setup of some form that allows continual monitoring of the channel status;
- Payment of a percentage of the penalty to the monitor if they detect unilateral closure of the channel.
I might have to pick up a copy of *Mastering Bitcoin*, this is starting to get out of my grasp.

I don't suppose anyone has details on how the Dutch deal with Bitcoin?

A laser-etched titanium card is $40 before shipping, stainless steel is $37.50; the benefits are that you get a fireproof method of cold storage. Shipping within the US is like $5, but I had to pay $30 or so.

Taking the example of LocalBitcoins, if you buy BTC from a guy who takes PayPal. The guy will send the coin to LocalBitcoins' escrow account where it'll wait for two confirmations:
- You say you sent the PayPal;
- The guy says they received the money from PayPal.
Once both have happened, LocalBitcoins will send you the BTC.

Each node in the Bitcoin network broadcasts its supported features in a user agent (UA), in much the same way as a web browser can tell a webserver about the features it supports in a UA; the ones you see here are all broadcasting that they support Segregated Witness under Bitcoin Improvement Proposal

An early version of Bitcoin had a bug, if I recall, that allowed you to create coins in any transaction. So one guy made a transaction with an output of many billions of coins.
I assume the blockchain was forked from the block before that, when the bug was patched. I know nothing further about it though.

I wouldn't go that far. The paper itself takes a cursory look at crypto, before concluding that it has many of the same problems as a standard fiat currency in this scenario (exchange rates, interest rates, and such like). It then goes on to discuss the design of notes and coins for a new Scottish currency.
So Bitcoin is given short shrift, but that it appears at all is an achievement, I guess.

For the best attempt to be made at anonymity, a Bitcoin address "should" only be used once, with all its inputs being shunted to a new change address every time you send money. The original white paper says this, and the reference client has a key pool of a hundred addresses specifically to allow for this.
Of course, some people (myself included) quite like having one address, and using it for more than one transaction. I've had maybe 20 things go through my previous address, and just changed to a new one last night.
There probably shouldn't be a penalty on transactions made by people like me, who like to re-use their addresses. Eligius, however, are holding transactions from re-used addresses behind, so they might not see the blockchain for a long while; that's a penalty on those transactions getting confirmed.
Hope that helps.
