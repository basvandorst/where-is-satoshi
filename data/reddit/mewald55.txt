80 million USD just got removed from the bitcoin market cap. According to [this chart]( the market cap has been increasing by ~400 million per month this year... 
(not sure if this is increased speculation or actual capital entering the market)
Combined with the halvening and market fear... uh... nobody has any idea.

What wallet service are you using? If you are using some online wallet, often they will immediately use your incoming balance to pay someone else's withdraw request so that they don't have to access their cold storage coins.
Eventually you should move your coins to a wallet that you fully control (to prevent having your coins stolen like this Bitfinex situation)
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:08:31
Really hard to say at this point with the lack of information. If they remain in the deposit address, my guess is Bitfinex will be able to control them at some point when they sort this situation out.
The bigger problem is even if they do control them, you may only receive a portion of them back in the event of bankruptcy distribution.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:47:39
I saw Zane talking about how deposit addresses do not represent your account balance here:
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:10:52
You should be ok on the legal side, but you should be very careful selling bitcoins for paypal dollars. It is a common scam, the scammer gets paypal to reverse the transaction and walks away with your bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:30:21
Bitfinex has commented that the addresses you deposited to do not represent the balance of your account.
Either way, it does not matter though. You will either be fully reimbursed for your losses if Bitfinex can afford to do so, or you will be partially reimbursed during a bankruptcy event. This would occur during bankruptcy even if your coins were not stolen, because all assets of the company would be distributed to the creditors.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:34:42
Connected bank accounts should be safe. The bitfinex hack happened on their servers, customer logins do not appear to be compromised. (use different passwords +2FA on each exchange to be safe)
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:33:30
Ya... I don't believe your individual BTC balance matters. You will either be fully reimbursed for your coins if Bitfinex can afford to do so, or you will be partially reimbursed during a bankruptcy event. This would occur during bankruptcy even if your coins were not stolen, because all assets of the company would be distributed to the creditors.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:00:04
I haven't seen any statement where Bitfinex or zanetackett were blaming customers for this theft. They have pretty clearly taken responsibility for the losses...
If Bitfinex is insolvent, this case will certainly go to bankruptcy liquidation either way.
And withdraws will likely be closed for weeks until this situation is sorted out, it wont be 2-3 days.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:52:20
They are using the market rate at the time of the hack, the last moment the BTC longs had the ability to trade. It seems fair to me.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:11:53
The claims priority during a bankruptcy liquidation get complicated, but basically all of the company's assets are sold and distributed to the creditors.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:49:05
A wallet is generally referring to when you yourself hold the private key to your bitcoins (hardware wallet, paper wallet...). This means you are in complete control of your own coins, and with good practices it is very difficult to have them stolen.  
A centralized exchange holds your private keys, and therefore completely controls your bitcoin. You are at the mercy of their security practices, which have been shown to be inadequate.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:48:15
~80 million USD just got stolen from the bitcoin market cap. But according to [this chart]( the market cap has been increasing by ~400 million per month this year... (not sure if this is increased speculation or actual capital entering the market).
Educate yourself on the fundamental reasons why you think bitcoin will be successful, and don't get caught up in the day to day prices.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:51:03
I wouldn't continue doing it without some advice from a lawyer + tax attorney... [This guy]( legally did everything correct and he is still looking at jail time for something like this. He might not be in the US though.
My opinion is that you are completely fine for this one time, but if you start moving serious money then some agencies will start looking at you. IANAL tho
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:35:48
Theoretically a slow reimbursement of customer funds would be ideal, but the number of governments, police, and lawyers that will push their way into this situation will make any novel bankruptcy avoidance plan very difficult. I imagine their recovery plan will largely be shaped by outside agencies, rather than by themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:18:30
If Bitfinex can possibly remain solvent and allocate the funds to reimburse customers they will, but they most likely will have to declare bankruptcy and you will receive a fraction of the coins you deposited (after a longggg legal battle)
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:05:52
The whole fear of centralization on the lightning network is FUD. Centralization is only bad if it is difficult to take away the power from the large parties. 
Centralization of money control in a central bank is bad because we can't take their power away. Centralization of lightning nodes is not dangerous, each user can make a choice to route through a different node with a couple clicks in their app, and poof, you free of their centralization.
Either the other nodes cooperate with your node and act how you want them to, or you move on to another route. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:57:02
Crazy story. To be realistic, receiving bitcoins on a USB is very risky, he could have kept a copy of the private key on his own computer and stolen them from you a few days after you walked away. Its quite possible you never had the coins in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:03:26
It will be a market-based competition for lower fees. Your wallet's routing will find the cheapest route to your destination, and if there is any profit to be made somebody else will charge a lower fee to be the preferred route.. So I don't think there will be a agreed pricing, it will be a race to the bottom... extremely cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:07:25
If I understand your question and LN correctly, yes, the receiver will know it is the same customer if the payment comes from the same payment channel.
Both parties share their funding TXID with the other when a channel is opened. I believe for a multi-hop LN transaction, this information is still visible to the receiving party, but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:15:28
If you deposit the coins on coinbase, transfer to gdax, and then withdraw from gdax, they will give you different coins back. This doesn't erase the previous traceability on the blockchain, but it gives you a fresh start going forward with coins that nobody can trace to you.

I just continued feeding myself inspiring messages about what this technology would do in the world (thx Andreas), and I never let the short-term issues distract me. I always thought: "OK sure, there are a lot of problems right now, but given enough time, somehow those problems will be fixed. The impossible problem of decentralized consensus has been solved, everything else is just a matter of time now"
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:39:56
The cheating tx is [time-locked]( for a future time, so the transaction is not valid until an agreed amount of time has passed. This time is configurable between the two-parties when the channel is opened, but I believe the default is around 3 days.
Also, you can trustlessly outsource this monitoring of a cheating TX to a third-party, they can also submit the punishment TX on your behalf.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:02:11
I've been building out what you are describing as bitcoin's mint.com for tracking your personal finances combined from your mobile + hardware + paper wallets at blockpath.com. You can import multiple xpubs+addresses into it, and get a cumalitive view of your balances and transactions. It has a graphical explorer built in too :).
It's still far from mint's UI, but we are getting there. The underlying block explorer platform is now solid, now I want to add address labeling,  better data summaries, and easier UI next.
Let me know what you think. Try an example out here:

Unspent means that the address you sent the coins to has not spent them yet. They are still sitting in that address waiting for someone to use them.
Check each exchange's list of deposit addresses to see if they didn't notice your deposit? I don't know, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:00:43
By 'voting', I think you mean mining the chain you like. So, no a node does not mine transactions, it just saves and relays transactions to other nodes. You would need to run a mining node to do that, and you would need expensive mining hardware also.
You don't really need to do all this to vote on the fork you believe in. By simply placing your value (money and trust) behind a fork, you are increasing it's value and making it more likely to survive. The miners follow the chain with the most profitably.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:09:37
I think the majority of taxes will still be collected one way or another. The silent tax of inflation will no longer be possible however, so government spending may be limited to actual funds available.
An advantage that I expect to see is that there will be a new level of visibility into the finances of governments. Anyone can type in the TXID to see the money that paid for that bridge. A couple million $ makes a detour and buys some new cars? Much harder to get away with corruption.
A hopeful idea is that direction contribution to particular projects will be possible. The homeless shelter could have a QR code on the outside, and if they continue to be transparent with their spending, individuals could be inclined to help them out. Wishful thinking I suppose.
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:18:58
Ya its not true... There is a requirement that *some* node has to be online monitoring the blockchain to see if the counter party submits a cheating transaction, but it doesn't have to be *your* node. 
You can trustlessly outsource this task to other third parties that will submit a transaction sweeping all of the channel balance to you on your behalf. I imagine this feature will be directly baked into wallet software so you'll never have to think about it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:34:26
Tough to say... Was that $5000 all the money you had in coinbase at the time of the withdrawal? I think a thief would take all the money they possibly could.
But another possibility is a clipboard malware on your computer, which silently changes a bitcoin address when you paste it into coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:07:22
Yes I agree. I was using the term 'inflation' loosely to mean the money printing of governments (and fractional reserves of banks) to pay for things that their base currency balance cannot sustain. Thanks for the correction.

**How to track all of your addresses and xPubs:**
* Go to [blockpath.com]( paste a comma separated list of BTC addresses+xPubs in the search box. The cumulative balance and all of the transactions will be shown. Use the graph tab to see the relationships between them graphed out.
* Add additional addresses+xPubs by clicking the "Add Address" button at the top of the table page.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:22:31
It is possible the exchange made an error by not noticing the deposit transaction, so they never credited your account with the money. Unlikely, but worth a shot at checking the list of deposit addresses they have assigned to your account.

No, the transaction is replicated on all the nodes in the world.
You can wait for other nodes to clear it, or try to use rbf or cpfp if you are more advanced.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:50:47
Yes, when you send all the coins to the same address, or a transaction uses multiple inputs from various addresses, it makes a strong case that those addresses are own by the same entity.
First, use a new receiving address for each client. Second, if you can manage, don't combine those addresses in new transactions you are making.
Since you already combined them into 1 address on another blockchain, its a little too late for that. But going forward, you can keep those older coins separate from the new coins you will receive. You also can try the suggestion of depositing then doing multiple withdraws from some exchange, you could get different coins. Don't use coinbase, their withdraw fees are insane.
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:00:23
That's a good question, and something I've been trying to build. My guess is that since the blockchain will only see the opening and closing transactions for a lightning network session, you'll only get an aggregate summary of transactions from the blockchain itself. 
But it will still be possible to take the LN wallet's history and use that to see your transactions aswell. That level of detail just won't be available to everybody via the blockchain.

Not quite, you still have to own and hold bitcoin to use the lightning network. The new network simply allows you to temporarily lock your coins into this higher network to do instant nearly free transactions, and then you can consolidate and resolve everything back on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:33:57
Haha. So we are actually using reddit's previously open-sourced code base to eventually build a discussion platform for blockchain data. That portion of the website isn't fully useful yet, so it still feels like reddit lol. But it should be blockpath.com links.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:43:35
The lightning network isn't a blockchain network, it is a layer *on top* of a blockchain network. It is a network where we can do instant and cheap payments millions of times per second, while still having those transactions be backed by the guarantee of Bitcoin.
When Lightning Network is done, *anyone* can join the open source protocol and eliminate most of their fees without the need for *credit card companies*.
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:09:49
Time locking occurs within a transaction, you can't time lock an address itself. But sure, you could make a time locked tx to your new wallet, destroy the old wallets key, and then you would not have access to the coins until the time locked tx is valid.

**New features for Blockpath this month:**
* Track the balance of an [xPub]( (or multiple xPubs!!) and graph the connections between the different addresses involved.
* You can convert the currency units used to -&gt; mBTC, Satoshis, USD, CNY, Euro and more. Use the settings button in the table toolbar to select your currency. You can also see the historical price for each transaction by opening the TX details within each TX.
* Import multiple addresses, transactions, or xPubs by opening the "Add Address" button at the top of the table page and pasting a comma-separated list of items.
* The "Amount" column of the table will now show the total value gained or sent to/from all of the addresses that you have imported into the app. This will help you if you have many transactions between your own addresses (as is common with xPubs and change addresses!), to show you only the amount you sent or received.
* The transaction graph mode will now organize the transactions by the date they occurred, making it easier to follow the flow of bitcoin.
* The mobile experience has been improved a bunch. Menus pinned at the bottom of the screen make using the graph and table much easier than before!
* The UI has been simplified by reducing filters down to All/Money In/Money Out or by date and cleaning up the summary sections.
* Login to your Blockpath account to save your currency + graph settings for when you come back.
We are working non-stop to pump out more features! If you have an idea to make it better for you, drop a comment below.

Using localbitcoins would use 2 fees, one send to the website, and one from the website to them (which they would pay, not you). Fees are actually pretty cheap now, $5 is 1-2 blocks, you could probably do $2-3 and get confirmed easily.
Without localbitcoins, you can just send it straight to their phone when you meet them.
If 1 BTC is the real amount you are selling, I wouldn't do that much your first time meeting this person. To me, that is higher risk, and you may be well over the law's limit for money transmitting without a license.
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:35:35
Well, by wallet I just meant your public+private key pair. 
You could show the theives your phone's wallet that you created a time locked transaction to, which would have a 0 balance, because the coins have not been transferred to your address yet.

Three easy options:
1. Change the data-dir of bitcoin-qt to your large SSD and resync there.
2. Export your private keys from bitcoin-qt and use a lightweight client.
3. Enable pruning mode to the last couple hundred blocks, that will keep the blockchain size under 10-20GB. This should be compatible with running a wallet in bitcoin-qt, but double check first.
Before any of these, be sure you have backup of your wallet.dat on a USB.

Yes a full fee is needed to make a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain. However, when you use Coinbase to send, they charge an additional inflated fee. If you use GDAX to send out of coinbase, you can pay 0 fee.

1- Its more like pre-loading a VISA debit card, because it can be spent anywhere and instantly. Basically a user just needs to commit a portion of their wallet into a payment channel, and then they can use that channel for all of their daily spending for that month or more. I imagine it will be a setting in your wallet that you set a BTC value you want to keep in your Lightning hot wallet, and your wallet SW will keep you topped up each month. 
2- One payment channel to a significantly connected hub can route your transactions to any endpoint. So if you commit 1 BTC, you can use that for all of your transactions (coffee, gas station, bills...) until the amount is depleted or the channel is closed. So the scalability comes from a user only needing 2 on-chain transactions per month (probably will be even longer in the future), and that can fund millions of transactions for them in the lightning network.
3- Closing the payment channel UI will depend on wallets, but I'm guessing the user's themselves won't ever worry about the closing process in the future. The wallet will handle the anti-cheating, and it will close the channel if time has expired or the amount is depleted.

Once you have a payment channel established, sending 1 satoshi is as simple as sending a packet of information over the internet. So just as your web browser communicates 1000's bytes/sec when you watch youtube, your browser could stream satoshis. 
And sure the LN opposition will say 'it costs $10 and 10 minutes to open that payment channel!!"... But I imagine once this thing hits scale, your browser will automatically open the channel to a near 0 fee hub, and the channel won't need to be closed for a year.

Hey, I saw your post and thought that was a good idea for a feature! I just spent the last couple hours coding this up and it is working on my block explorer now.
Here is an example address:

You can go long BTC... same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:06:58
Sure no problem. An xPub is basically a seed that can generate all of the public addresses your account can use, but it cannot be used to create any private keys (unless you have ever shared one of your private keys with somebody...). 
So you can export your xPub from mycellium and search for it on a block explorer, and you can see all of the used addresses within your account.
When you give mycellium your master seed, it *should* do this same thing to search for any previously used addresses, but I'm hoping that mycellium simply isn't looking through enough addresses to find your used ones.
Calm down and don't worry, there is no need to rush with anything here. Take some time to check your seed word spelling, think about when you wrote it down, and learn about xPubs. We'll figure it out.

I just meant the tx that sent the coins to your address you are trying to import, it probably needs to be confirmed before blockchain.info will allow spending it.
I would continue trying to import that private key into a wallet. No sense in waiting for Bitcoin core to sync.

Hot off the press, I just added the ability to track xPubs on Blockpath. I'm uncertain if it will work for all the different wallet's address derivation paths, but it is working for all the example xPubs I can find to test with. Let me know if it works well for you.

I'm still strongly considering your TxId transformation idea. I think I can swing it as an option you can enable. Thank you for all your feedback!

Hey, I'm sorry that I'm excited to hear you have this problem... I've been working towards a solution for this, although I am still a ways off from being finished still.
I've been building [Blockpath.com]( as a tool for accounting on the blockchain. Currently you can create a watch only wallet with groups of multiple bitcoin addrs/xpubs, label them, and view cumulative balances and transactions for each group. Transactions between your own addresses are automatically accounted for. Transactions can also be labeled for greater clarity.
You can see current USD equivalent values as well. Dollar value at time of transaction is almost ready, I have the data, just need to update the UI.
Of course, end of year tax reporting is another problem I haven't tackled yet. Will do soon.
I'm interested in your feedback so I can better understand your use case. I haven't considered a QBO plugin, would you want that just for getting an overview of your finances, or for taxes aswell? Let me look into that 2 decimal rounding more, maybe there is a work\-around?

'Confirmations' usually refers to how many blocks have been created since a transaction was included in a block. The blocks will continue to be created roughly every 10 minutes forever. I'm assuming you mean how long will it take for a transaction to be included in its first block:
As the blocks become full of transactions, the time for transactions with low fees to be included in a block will take longer and longer until the capacity is increased. There are many different plans for expanding the capacity of the network, it will be a constant battle to continue scaling.
This is similar to the internet, in the beginning the network could only handle sending text and low-res images, and the capacity of the network constantly improved until we are streaming HD movies now. The demand will always grow to match the capacity...

The other answers are trolling... When you are making a transaction and sending it to the bitcoin network from your computer, it either happens or it doesn't. There is no in-between failed state. 
All your computer does is create a short string of letters (~250Bytes) and send it to the network, which takes less than a millisecond to occur. Either your computer sends the data, or it doesn't.

I wouldn't recommend using Abe anymore... It's very old now, and support for it has died off years ago. It will take at least 1-2 months to sync the SQL database with the bitcoin blockchain.
I would recommend using bitcore + insight block explorer if you want something that sets up quickly and is well supported. It does not use an SQL database, so its not the best choice for supporting very heavy traffic, but for an early stage project it is fast , easy, and reliable. Literally just type 2 commands in your server console and you will have a full-node + block explorer in a minute, fully synced in 3-4 days. 
Insight: 
There are a couple open-sourced SQL block explorers, but I feel none of them are mature enough to justify using over Insight for an early stage project.

I appreciate the positive comment. 
For now, the data must be formatted in our CSV file format. It's a fairly simple format that just needs the basic data in the right columns, and then that file can be read within your browser.
We also have a feature that will connect your browser directly to your exchanges API to sync trades, but some exchanges were having problems so we've disabled that feature for this release.

I'm using the ccxt library for my exchange communication, and for now it doesn't look like it has been included.
You could still export the CSV, format it, and upload it under a different exchange. The exchange you select in our app only dictates where exchange rates will be fetched from.
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:34:17
Yes, this tool is quite private. None of your trades, exchange-sourced exchange rates, calculations, or exported data ever touches our servers. But sure, it runs in the browser, so its not perfect.

Hey everyone,
It was a little stressful going through the QuickBooks App review process, they have fairly strict requirements, and we weren't sure how they would respond to a crypto app. Although there were some hiccups, I was surprised that most of the review team was welcoming to a Bitcoin app, and we are now the first crypto app published in the QuickBooks Online App Store!
We want to simplify crypto accounting, so more businesses and accountants will be be able to work with Bitcoin. A major part of this is fitting Bitcoin into existing accounting systems, so we've published this app to sync Bitcoin transactions + capital gains reports directly into QuickBooks Online. We are excited by the positive feedback from users, they are saying it is helping them out by automating the manual data entry tasks, and we are continuing to make it even better.
Check out more details here

The directory where the bitcoin clients will download the blockchain is in the bitcoin.conf file. The line that looks like this:   datadir=/the/path/bitcoin
If they both point to the same directory, one will have a lock on the files, and the other won't be able to access.
Yes, the new clients have been completely syncing in 1-3 days for me, depending on your PC and how lucky you get with peers around you. I would run a sync with a new client, then drop your wallet.dat file into the new data directory.
Also, sync progress will slow down a lot as you get closer to 100%. The blocks have been much fuller in the last 2 years than all of the previous 6 years.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:55:30
Yup, /index folder is 120GB now

Check out this thread that is going on right now, they are talking about old wallet.dat files. I don't know if you can use a new client or you need your older client, it depends on just how old your bitcoin-qt is...
I personally wouldn't uninstall or delete the bitcoin-qt files yet, just in case you find the newer clients don't work for you. I would just stop the old client, point your newer client's datadir to a fresh directory and run the sync. 
I'm not 100% sure what format the backup wallet button will create. You can usually also find the wallet.dat file in the same datadir that the blocks are in...
Also, if you've never created a wallet backup, do it right now and put it on a USB before you keep moving and deleting things!

You would create a new transaction from your wallet that spends the unconfirmed coins you hope to receive. Its not really a straight-forward easy process because your wallet won't simply allow you to spend coins you don't have, so you will have to search for a tool or do it manually from a command line application.

I'm in India now, can confirm. The people I know here are hoarding their cash and limiting any cash purchases they need to make... They are also all experimenting with banking apps, every time they make a purchase they ask if a local banking app is accepted.
Not sure if bitcoin is right for them though. There just isn't any benefit to them in taking complete control+risk of handling their own money, when a convenient app will keep the money safe instead. There is already enough chaos and difficulty in their daily life.

It's the IP addresses that have sent transactions using that address to the blockchain network of nodes. If the user/wallet is smart, they used a proxy to pass their transaction along, so they don't directly connect their IP to the miner they are passing their transaction to.

You are correct how the Bitcoin fee market works. The blocksize limit creates scarcity, and users essentially bid on that space by setting their transactions fee.
The problem is BitPay does not make it easy to set your own fee. They prepackage the address, amount, and fee together in a code that is meant to be scanned by your phone and payed. The fee they set is usually $3-5, so that your transaction is very likely to clear in the next block.
This Bitcoin fee estimator shows that 29K transactions have cleared today with less than a 14 cent fee (8 Sat/Byte is \~14 cents on a normal tx). You may have to wait an 20 minutes - 2 hours for this to be confirmed, but in most situations this is ok.
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:39:19
Tracking rounded numbers has been one method of tracking.
Typically in a transaction with only 2 outputs, the neat rounded number is the value the user specified, while the non-rounded value is the change address. That helps them to know that you probably own the new change address, and can link your addresses together like that.
I wouldn't be too paranoid about it though.

This tool graphs out the connections between addresses or transactions to make it easier to understand the movement of bitcoins on the blockchain.
So for example, you can search your bitcoin address, and you can view a graph of all the addresses you have sent and received coins from. Then you can follow them through time by right clicking on an address and seeing the network of where they go.
Does that make sense?

It's a decent idea, I agree that having big confusing tx id's everywhere complicates the design of every block explorer made so far. If we are going to automatically rename all TXs, we might as well just label them     Look at your normal banking app, it doesn't tell you the long database ID of each transaction, they just tell you the date, person, and value of the tx... I've been considering removing tx ids all together from the standard view.

If you just want a simple blockchain explorer... Here is my comment to a similar post 1 year ago:










Unfortunately insight doesn't support bech32... But still the ease of setup is unbeatable. Most of the other SQL projects will require you to build your own front-end block explorer.

If he purchased the mining equipment with Bitcoin, he has to pay capital gains on the sale of that bitcoin. Selling bitcoin for cash or using it to buy goods are both considered sale events.
The mining equipment expense could probably be used as a business expense to reduce taxes, but that would be determined by general business tax rules, nothing to do with Bitcoin taxes.

I would graph 1GvmpUY1RdR5zf7jDZnpjfuBnoCz3S2xSS, then  switch the graph mode to "transaction mode" using the button at the top of the graph. From there, you can begin following the string of transactions the coins have been thru.
I've seen a lot of thiefs make 100s of TXs and try to split the coins up a bit. If that is the case, you can hover and click your mouse on each transaction node to see what output received the majority of coins in each TX, that should help you follow them. 
Let me know if that works for you. Your use case is particularly interesting to me, I'll try and help you if I can.

For me, just basic d3 was pretty painless. You just pass it your set of nodes and links, pass it the DOM element template, define some parameters, and let it go. It handles all of the coordinates and forces itself.
I believe the higher level libraries are usually for interfacing with other libraries, optimizing by using webGL, or making different parts of the UI. Once you understand the d3.js methodology, I found designing parts of the UI (click+dragging, context menus, entering/exiting nodes) was pretty straight forward.

Ya I think you have the right idea already. You just need to find the price you acquired the Bitcoin at. You can get that from downloading your exchange history, or using the price at the time of transaction if the transaction was immediately after the purchase.
Since all of your coins were purchased on the same exchange and held for more than 1 year, you don't really have the option/need to use Specific Identification, so where they are now doesn't really matter. Just use FIFO to match buys to sells.
The only tip I have, if you are going to hand-calculate your losses, make your sales nice round BTC numbers. Preferably, make the sale the same BTC amount as the acquire transaction to make it really easy.
If you have a lot of acquiring transactions, my block explorer [Blockpath]( can show you the price+value at the time of transaction for you. Just search for your address, and in the left toolbar settings change the currency to "Rate at Time of Transaction". The exchange rate can be found by clicking on a transaction hash and opening the 'Details' .

He used BitPay because he was forced to by the provider if he wants to pay with Bitcoin.
He wants to pay with Bitcoin because of the many conveniences it provides. A Bitcoin transaction should only be 10 cents, but BitPay tries to make you pay a $3-5 fee.
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:28:07
Nope, that shouldn't matter. They were in your possession the entire time, where they were stored is not important.
How they were separated would only be important if you elected you use Specific Identification to calculate your taxes. That would be useful if you had two separated holdings of Bitcoins, you could have sells match only against buys within the same account. But that isn't useful or needed in your situation.

You have to pay capital gains on the difference between the value when you obtained the bitcoin, and the value you sold it or purchased something with it.
So if you bought $65 of bitcoin, and then less than one year later, the Bitcoin was worth $70 and you purchased something using all of the bitcoin, you would pay short-term capital gains tax on the $5 of income (which would be taxed at your ordinary income rate).
In all likelihood, if you bought and spent the Bitcoin relatively quickly, the value of it was probably almost the same. The value may have actually went down before you spent it, in which case you would have a tax deduction.

When you hover your mouse over a transaction, it just simply changes the width of the links to the outputs based on how many coins moved to that output. The thick line will be where the majority of coins are going.
Clicking on the transaction will scroll the side table to that transaction so you can see the actual numbers.
Does that feature make sense, or would you rather see the numbers on the graph as well?

If you aren't using an escrow service (like localbitcoins provides for 1% fee), then you need to wait for at least 1 confirmation in a block. This is especially important now that blocks are fairly full, if the seller uses a low fee it may take a long time to be included in a block.

It doesn't take a majority of miners to agree to change the algorithm, anyone including you can create a fork right now. 
The question is: will anyone believe your fork with few miners has any value? Part of the high value of bitcoin is the incredible amount of mining power protecting it. It would take a significant investment to co-opt bitcoin, while it would only cost $1000 to corrupt a smaller fork.
If a significant portion of the bitcoin population moves their collective value to the new fork, well yes, we could see a change in hashing algorithm.

The issue you are seeing is probably because of the difference in exchange rate the two wallets are using (there is currently large differences in exchange rates bc of some issues). This doesn't have an effect on your bitcoin, you still have it all. Don't look at the USD value, look at the bitcoin value in the wallet.

7 Txs/second is an estimate of how many small-sized transactions can fit into the 1MB block size limit. Some transactions can be much bigger.
In addition, some blocks are not filled to the limit with transactions because there may be other "advantages" to doing this, which leaves many transaction unconfirmed. 
You can see here that most blocks are near the 1MB limit, with some being left nearly empty.

The only reason I would prefer pre-generating the addresses is that the private keys for those addresses can be kept a bit safer. You can create a few thousand addresses at once, then hold the private key offline, away from the public server that is vulnerable to being hacked.
The only downside is you have to monitor the number of addresses that have been used up, which if that becomes a problem, it is a very good problem to have...
@_date: 2017-04-22 06:52:07
Ah yes ok, if we are talking about these sorts of vendors...
So coinbase likely has systems to see that you sent money to an address that sent money to a disallowed address. Using only a one transaction step is not enough to protect yourself.
You will need to look into bitcoin tumblers, joinmarket, or other methods.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:53:38
Haha ya, no problem. It will help you sleep a lot better knowing your money is completely safe rather than out on some public server.

Depends if there is a significant demand in both of those areas to change the money from cash -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; cash. Check the localbitcoins markets in each of those places.
I've heard from some friends that lived in South Africa, the locals were willing to pay quite a bit over bitcoin market value, maybe there is enough of a demand?

We haven't had a block in over 1 hour. Likely nothing is wrong with your transaction, we are just waiting for some blocks to be made.
@_date: 2017-04-22 06:26:55
Mmm yes, you can move and use bitcoin however you want. What are your concerns with doing this?
Edit: It is ok to use your main wallet to send bitcoin. There are only 2 downsides:
1. People can see how much money you have on the blockchain. With coinbase, this won't be a problem because your balance doesn't map to an address.
2. If you are dealing with seriously large amounts of money, that means your money is easy for you to access and therefore easier for hackers to access. You should keep some of it in an offline wallet so it is harder to be stolen.
Bonus: With coinbase, you don't have the private key for your bitcoin, so you don't actually own it. If coinbase or the government wants to take it, its gone. 
TLDR: using mycelium is a perfectly fine method.
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:59:28
Mainly it is a product of the difficulty to get fiat money in/out of the exchange, in/out of the country the exchange is in, and the financial privacy that the fiat transfers have.

Your logic about buying 5 bitcoin and having 5 bitcoin is correct haha. I'm not sure what you mean with your first sentence though... 
If you are trading on an exchange and you buy bitcoin at a high price, sell at a low price, then buy at a higher price again I suppose you could say you've lost 1 BTC in a trade...

This is a problem that should be fixed easily as the tools for handling crypto are made easier to use. 
Ideas such as: 
* Smart contracts combined with oracles that trigger a transaction when your death is proved.
* Chains of time-locked TXs. As an example, you must sign a new time-locked transaction once every 5 years or your bitcoin will be sent to your family by your previously signed TX.
* Using multi-key wallets, where you distribute your keys to family + 3rd party insurance companies to be jointly used after your death.
... and any combination of those. May sound a little confusing now, but I think tools will be developed to make it very simple and commonplace. Certainly better than signing a piece of paper and going to court to argue over everything.

2 different methods, both very easy if you can find some sort of login credentials for your miner.
* Download a FTP client such as FileZilla to your personal computer. 
    
    Setup an SSH connection to your miner using the IP address + SSH Key or Password (hopefully you can find one of these??). Login as the root user.
    
    In FileZilla, navigate to /etc folder. Transfer the hosts file from the miner to your personal computer. Open it and edit it as described on antbleed.com. Transfer it back to the miner.
* Download an SSH client such as Putty. Setup an SSH connection to your miner. 
    
    Edit the hosts file:   "sudo nano /etc/hosts"
    
    If prompted, type your root password for sudo access.
    
    Modify the file as antbleed.com describes
    
    Close file: ctrl-x
    
    Save changes:  "y" 
I'm not actually familiar with these miners, some steps may need to be changed slightly.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:26:24

@_date: 2018-11-29 12:55:25
It's pretty much just limited by the hardware of the two clients and the internet connection between them. Once a channel is open, making a LN transaction is just sending a packet of data from one computer to another. So millions of TPS is pretty achievable now. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:04:44
Right now my gap limit is also 20, but your comment has inspired me to increase it a bit. Trouble is, increasing the gap limit on a scan like this really blows up the time it takes to complete. Maybe I can just add an optional input field to increase the gap limit up to 50 or so? What gap limit would you recommend?
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:09:46
Also I forgot to mention, there is an option to manually put in your derivation path, and it allows you to search endlessly up through addresses and see their balances. The gap limit really only applies for the full range scan mode.

That's nice that Electrum makes it easy! I'm not familiar with Electrum, most mobile wallets and online tools I've used don't show the derivation path. Worst of all is when you are trying to restore an xPub, and you've forgotten what wallet and software version you were running.

That's a good method too. Just use gap 20 for the scan, and if it finds a used path, use gap 100+.

Over the years I've seen a lot of people (including myself) confused over what derivation paths their HD wallet is using.
Instead of endlessly searching google and guessing different paths, I decided to make a tool that does it for me. This tool searches ranges of derivation paths to find any used addresses, and gives a complete report of all addresses.
You can test it out with an example xpub given in the tool if you want.
The tool is here:  [Blockpath xPub Scanner](
Let me know if I should add any more search ranges for other HD wallets as well.
Hopefully this helps someone out!
@_date: 2018-11-29 12:44:25
Wow you replied quickly lol, less than 15 seconds after I posted. I gave a brief explanation in another comment just now.
Basically, HD wallets each use different methods for generating new accounts and receiving addresses for the user, and it can be tricky to figure out what method it is using. This tool scans all the methods and figures it out for you.

Thank you bud ;)
@_date: 2019-01-31 03:07:38


That's exactly what the 'Scan All' option does :)  
Hmmm, so my app only can check if the non-hardened child keys have any used addresses... You mentioned that the derivation path may be m/44'/0'/0' , which is a hardened derivation path. That means only the extended *private* key/seed can be used to generate account addresses.
If that is the case, then you will have to search for a command-line utility and manually search through the addresses yourself, because obviously you don't want to enter your seed on any website app.
There are a couple of offline tools here that I think can help you out:
Good luck

My website, [Blockpath.com]( , can graph out the connections between your addresses, and you can expand the graph by right clicking on addresses to load more. There is also a transaction mode to track bitcoins through time. Best of luck on tracking down your coins, let me know if it helps you out!

So you open a LN channel by putting coins into a shared address on the blockchain between you and another person. Neither person can spend the coins without the other person's signature.
To make the cool new LN transactions, Person1 signs a transaction that will allow Person2 to spend some of the coins in 10 days. Person2 is happy, because they now know that they can claim those coins in 10 days if they want.
To make another transaction, Person1 can sign another transaction for more coins that can be spent in 9 days. If this transaction is broadcast and mined in a block, the older transaction valid in 10 days won't be usable anymore.
Person2 can send back some coins to Person1 as well, by signing a new transaction valid in 8 days that gives himself some coins and Person1 some coins.
Now, Person2 can try to cheat by broadcasting the transaction that is valid in 9 days. That would give them the most coins, and give Person1 nothing!
However, if Person1 notices this old transaction being broadcasted on the bitcoin network, there are some tricks built in that allow Person1 to take all of the coins in the channel, which is a massive penalty for trying to cheat.
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:32:09
Do you know if the bitcoin address has been used or not? If so, that makes it a lot easier to know if the address is from that seed.
Anyways, I've made an online tool that accepts an xPub, and it scans all common derivation paths and gives a complete report of all used addresses found. Maybe it could be useful for you?

I think both are fine, the bigger question is finding a wallet that you like that supports one of them.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:52:16
That is the default time offset for hash timelocked contracts on the lightning network.
ELI5: A payment on the lightning network is just signing a TX that is valid in 10 days. The next payment made is set to be valid in 9 days... and so on down to 3 days. It is possible for the other party to submit one of the first transactions to try and steal their money back, so someone needs to check the blockchain every 3 days.
Disclaimer: This is a huge simplification, HTLC's and outsourced channel monitoring make everything way better. Also, the 3 day offset can be changed to any value agreed upon.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:26:19
You should probably think of what goal you are trying to achieve first. 
If you just want to make transactions and check address balances, using a public API to get started should be fine.
If you want to analyze data in the blockchain (such as a block explorer), go ahead and download it and possibly sync it into a database.
I've only used Python so far, it has bitcoin libraries for everything I've needed, but I believe the other top ~5 langauges are well supported as well.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:35:34
Its OK, bitcoin is a little tricky to understand but you will be very happy that you took the time to learn it.
Yes Jaxx creates a private key, and from that private key it creates a public address you can receive bitcoin at. The coins won't be linked to this private/public key forever though! When you spend the coin by sending it to another public address, that new private+public key will control it. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:54:43
The safest wallet is usually considered to be a hardware wallet, but they cost around $100. 
The next safest is probably a paper wallet, if you are careful to isolate the computer when you create the private key and print it. Downside is that you can't make transactions with a paper wallet, it is just good for long term storage.
Next safest is a tie between an Android/Iphone app or linux TAILS on a USB. These are good for smaller amounts and making your daily transactions.
I don't have an opinion on Blockchain.info. It is browser based, and pretty popular (good target for hackers?), so I wouldn't keep a very large amount there.
Realistically, if you are just buying a small amount to get started, a phone app or Blockchain.info is perfectly fine. Just be sure you make a backup of your account, you are much more likely to accidentally lose your account than you are to be hacked.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:48:02
Yes, move it off of coinbase so you have access to the free fork coins coming up.

If you want to actively trade every fork coin that comes out each week, then no... but if you are a long term hodler, then the value swings shouldn't bother you. And if some fork coin ends up being valuable in a year, you will still be able to access that fork coin using your paper wallet.

It would be hard work, but a constantly updated summary of the all the newest tech the crypto devs are working on would be really useful.

@_date: 2017-10-23 12:33:10
I don't believe having more relaying nodes matters past a certain point.
The important driving factor of success of one fork over another is perceived market value and market adoption of the coin, which trickles down into affecting the mining hashpower.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:33:47
It is safe in the sense that you will have access to the new fork coins, but you won't be able to spend them using the blockchain.info wallet itself. You will have to export the private key out of blockchain.info and import it into an app capable of making transactions on the other chains.
Also, be careful with making transactions after the fork, as the bitcoin tx could also be replayed by anyone on the other chains.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:26:21

When Bitcoin forks into 2 chains, all of the pre-fork coins are now spendable separately on both chains. In effect this means that you basically have all of your original-chain coins, and you have the same number of coins on the new fork. You just have to be very careful when you spend coins on one chain, as that same transaction may be valid on the fork chains aswell (called a replay attack)
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:25:24
If you end up actually sending the coins to them, be super sure they make backups. So many friends and family that I gave some coins to "deleted that app" and "can't find that piece of paper you gave me" or "cant remember that password"... sigh.

If a channel is already open, I believe you don't need internet to make LN transactions with a local peer.
You would need to access the internet once every ~3 days to be sure the peer has not submitted a cheating transaction however.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:15:31
You can use the same seed over again unlimited times. Think of it as the one private key / password that can be used to find all the private keys / passwords you've ever used within that account.
But you should probably move the bitcoins to a new master seed if you suspect someone will find your phone.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:04:49
Running a full node and hosting your own wallet are mostly separate things. 
Running a full node means you are helping the bitcoin network by validating transactions and rebroadcasting them to network peers.
You can optionally have the full node software also host your wallet. This just means that the software will store your private keys, and it will use your own full node to monitor/create your wallet's transactions.
Realistically, I believe not many people use bitcoin core software for running a casual personal wallet, because it means that you are keeping your private key on a PC/server that has open connections to the internet. That's a bit risky if you aren't careful.
When a fork happens, the bitcoin core software would not recognize the fork. You would have to export your private keys to another app that will create transactions for the other chains.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:19:57
Of course there is a chance... and if that happens, you will own the fork coin with your paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:42:34
Yup, this is the right answer. You could consider running pruning nodes, which only maintain the most recent blocks, allowing you to only need 5-10GB (adjustable).
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:47:26
Quit watching the price everyday. If you think 2-5 years from now, these little swings will be laughable.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:16:07
Your balance's on xapo or coinbase aren't directly reflected on the blockchain, because they will mix your coins and other people's coins in different transactions. They do this so they can keep the majority of their coins in cold storage, and just use a small portion of them for making actual transactions on the blockchain.
In the transaction you posted, Xapo sends the 0.0063798 to coinbase, and Xapo likely just deducts the 'fee' from your Xapo balance. The other 5.97BTC output is going back to Xapo as change, or it is going to another customer who requested a withdrawal also.
You should consider moving your coins off of both websites, so that you get the free fork coins coming up, and you have full control over your own bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:09:32
Sorry, I said the wrong fork lol (too many of them...)
I meant the bitcoin gold blockchain itself. Your original chain Bitcoins will be spendable on both chains. You will just have to import your private key into a bitcoin gold capable wallet when a wallet is announced...
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:03:01
It just means using your private key to cryptographically prove that the message is coming from you / your public address (or whoever knows the private key). 
It is free and has been around long before bitcoin. Check out PGP signatures. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:03:20
When a fork happens, all existing coins are now spendable on each fork independently.
So an unconfirmed transaction would be independently evaluated by each fork's blockchain (if it was propagated to both chains...). If the transaction is valid and mined on the original chain (should be), the receiver gets those coins. Separately, if the transaction is also valid and mined on the fork chain, the receiver gets the fork coins as well.
If the transaction is already included in a block (aka has &gt;1 confirmation) before the fork, the receiver will have access to the original and the new fork coins.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:53:43
Mmm yes, if the number of nodes drops low enough, or there is a large enough communication conflict between Core nodes and S2X nodes that there is orphaning occuring, I would agree adding more nodes with white lists would be helpful.
I am just doubtful that we will get anywhere close to that low of a node count. Especially since the majority of miners are already using the private [FIBRE relay network]( which already is using white lists to avoid this problem.
Your reasoning is correct tho!
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:48:24
Mmm, you will still have the same problem of trying to separate the two coins. It is a large problem that every user will face, and there are not any easy tools or methods to get around it yet.

Sorry, I can't fathom a guess to that question. I can't make sense of this quote from their blog post:


@_date: 2017-10-23 13:39:08
If you want to try to claim any fork coins, such as bitcoin gold, you will have to create a bitcoin gold transaction. Unfortunately, that bitcoin gold transaction is also valid on the BTC chain. That means you might accidently spend your BTC and your bitcoin gold at the same time, and you might lose your BTC!
So... After the fork, you will want to move your BTC into a new BTC-only address, before you try to spend your bitcoin gold. Unfortunately this may be very tricky to do, depending on what replay-protection bitcoin gold implements.
The simple answer is: Just wait until after the fork and follow some of the guides+advice of others on how to move your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:49:00
Check with your exchange to see if they will be distributing fork coins to you or not. If they won't, you have to ask yourself if a little effort is worth free coins that will likely have a value of about 10% of bitcoin.
Personally, properly making a secure paper wallet just so you get fork coins isn't worth it. For that amount, I would just use a phone wallet app, you could have it done in 10 minutes. Its a good learning experience for you to control your own coins anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:03:54
The laws of a stock exchange can be bent to benefit certain individuals... The detailed information of trades can be used for profit by those with power... Only large and wealthy companies can get listed on the big stock exchanges...
A blockchain's rules cannot be broken by anybody. There is no need for regulation, because math and computer code does not cheat. The rules are also put in place by a *more* democratic process, the people choose which blockchain they want to support.
All the trading information would be public to all, so everyone is on level ground.
It doesn't matter who the miners are, either they follow the rules or everyone ignores them. The developers have no control over the blockchain, they just present code to the community and individuals decide what blockchain code they support.
And finally... 2/3rds of the world does not have access to a stock exchange like you do. No bank or stock exchange would allow a guy from Kenya to signup and buy Tesla stock, or to issue stock for a store he is building. A blockchain based exchange does not need to discriminate who it allows in, because the rules and regulation are baked into the system.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:24:20
Did you immediately receive the coins in your bitcoin wallet, or did they stay on an exchange that you don't have records for anymore?
If you have a blockchain transaction immediately after purchase, just lookup the market price at that time, I think that should be enough.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:58:46
When you are sending that 1 BTC, you are using your private key to sign a previous output that was pointing at your address. That signature you make is only valid for the exact input/output addresses and values that you specify in your transaction. 
The magic comes from cryptography. Anyone can see your signature and prove that the correct private key created it, but nobody can work backwards and discover what the private key actually is.
If someone changes anything and rebroadcasts, the network will realize it has an invalid signature and each participating node will reject the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:46:15
A block holds all the bitcoin network transactions that are confirmed roughly each 10 minutes. A transaction generally only involves a few people, while a block is made from many transactions from people all over the world.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:32:48
Both chains share the same history of blocks, but going forward the two chains will disagree on what set of block validation rules to follow. Because they share the same history, all coins before the fork are separately spendable on each chain, and all users now have a choice of using one or both of the chains.

If a web app is ok, check out my site, [Blockpath.com]( . You can create a watch-only wallet, label your addresses/xpubs, sort them into groups, tag your transactions, and store your data locally if you'd like.
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:28:07
My website, [Blockpath.com]( , was pretty much made for this. It is a watch-only wallet tracker that can support multiple addresses + xpubs, address labeling, TX labeling, and give you an aggregate view of all of your transactions. It also has a cool graphical explorer, xpub analyzer, and a handful of other nifty features.
While the data will always be retrieved from our servers, you can choose to *store* your data only in your browser, encrypted with a password, by going to the wallet settings.
Hope it helps you!

The private key is stored on your device, and you should leave the key safely stored there. If anyone else finds your private key, they can take your bitcoin.
The public key is (simply put) the account your bitcoins are stored at on the blockchain. To spend them, your wallet uses the private key to create a transaction.
The private and public key are already "linked". You can actually mathematically generate the public key, just by knowing the private key...
You are already in full control of your coins! Just be sure you create a backup of your Jaxx wallet in case you lose your device and you are OK!

The coins in your mycelium app will be spendable on both chains, but you will need to manage carefully separating the two coins. 
Your mycelium account uses an HD account to create new private keys for each address in your account. After you safely move the BTC out of that HD account, I believe the only way to find the private keys for each address is to manually walk thru the BIP32 keys (using a tool such as  find each address with a balance, and import that private key into a bitcoin gold app to spend it.
Not a simple process if you are new... And it may be very dangerous to your original BTC, depending on what replay protection they come out with.

Yes, transaction fees are generally relative to the byte size of your transaction. So when the average network fee is low, it is a good idea to consolidate many outputs into one. That way, in the future if fees go up, you only need to use 1 input.
You can also send them to a segwit address to further reduce your future fees.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:45:01
Ah yes. If you don't make a transaction with your coins, they will always remain at that private/public key pair, and that key pair will always be yours (if you keep the private key a secret!)
In practice, it is easier and safer to make a bitcoin transaction to move your coins out of Jaxx, rather than trying to copy/paste your private key. For example, if you wanted to move them to another wallet, that app would just create a new private/public key pair, and you would make a transaction from Jaxx to the new app's key.
In fact, most apps will create a new key for every time you want to receive bitcoins. If you actively use bitcoins for a few years, you will likely have thousands of private keys... You don't need to keep track of all of them, your wallet app will handle all of that for you.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:24:37
Every single bitcoin in existence will also exist on the bitcoin gold chain. The question is whether or not you have access to your private key or not. If you leave your coins on websites like Coinbase, they won't give you access. 
If you hold your coins yourself, on just about any wallet that gives you access to your private key, you will be ok. That includes electrum, trezor, paper wallets, most phone apps, Blockchain.info wallet...
I don't think it is too late to move your coins into your own control. It looks like the fork will occur in about 27 hours, but nobody really knows...

From the entrepreneurial perspective, the way a company can make money has fundamentally changed. Before bitcoin, financial service companies made money by standing in between the movement of money and taking a percentage of it for transacting it. Now because bitcoin transactions are directly between peers, taking a cut from each transaction will not be possible as more and more of the common financial services become decentralized.
Any products looking to make a profit in the future will have to be tools and services *around* the blockchain that users freely choose to pay for, rather than forcefully standing in between the user and the blockchain. Kinda confusing, I hope that is clear.
Additionally, look into micropayments. It will allow products and services to earn money per micro-use of the service. It allows charging per page-load, per minute of use, per mB of data transferred, or many other possibilities.

Can you find the transaction ID? It should be listed somewhere in the website/wallet you send the coins from. Take that transaction ID and look up the bitcoin transaction in a block explorer.
Most likely the transaction had a low fee and was not accepted by the network. The other possibility is your bitcore wallet is not synced with the blockchain and did not notice the transaction come through.

If you hold your own coin, it will automatically be valid on both forks. If it is on an exchange, you have to ask them if they are making the changes necessary to their codebase to support both forks. Basically, the coin is always valid on both chains, but the exchange might be lazy and not give you the coin on both chains when you ask for it.

Yes, everybody still verifies transactions as usual. The signature data is still sent to everybody as usual. 
The advantages are that the sig data is not actually included in the block chain, so it can pruned separately when it is no longer needed, and this change is *mostly* a softfork, so old clients will still be *mostly* compatible.

When someone sends you money, they basically create an output that has a "lock" on it. There are various types of "locks" (P2SH, P2PKH, various scripts...). The basic idea is this lock contains the receiver's public address, and the key to unlock it is a signature from the private key of that public address. To spend this output, you create a signature to prove you hold the private key to that address...
From the bitcoin wiki:

If bitcoin splits into two forks, the exchange you are using may choose to recognize only one fork, even though your coins they are holding are valid on both chains. By holding your own coins, you ensure you can use the coin on both chains.
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:08:11
Yes, as long as the bitcoins have been sent to that address before a fork, the coins will be spendable on both chains. (Really, all 16 million bitcoins in existence will exist on both chains. It is just a matter of if you control them. If they are on an exchange, they might be lazy and only send you one half of the coin)

That user is required to maintain a fiat+BTC balance large enough to pay you off. If the price goes too low, the exchange will force them to liquidate their remaining funds to pay you back. And of course, the exchange won't allow them to withdraw any of your funds :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:32:35
They still essentially sign the part of the transaction with the inputs and the outputs, but the sig data is obviously not included in that block signature.
Your second question is interesting, and I bet the answer will come down to each individual miner's implementation. Bitcoin Core standard settings will probably require receiving all of the witness data for a block before it considers the block valid, but I could see miners looking for a speed increase to consider the block valid before receiving any witness data. We've seen that before with the SPV mining fork of July 2015.

The top block explorers have parsed the raw blockchain data into a relational database, with top queries being cached. You can achieve nearly the same thing by using insight.js, it will build an address cache like you are looking for.

There is a 0% chance in my mind that bitcoin or a similar crypto does not radically transform the world.

There isn't really ever proof that the miner verified a transaction, there is only proof that it is included in the block. This is done with the hashMerkleRoot in the block header, which is a hash of all of the transactions included in the block.
The block header is then used in the mining process when miners are searching for a nonce value to satisfy the block header hash requirement to mine a new block... So basically the list of transactions cannot be changed without invalidating the block.
It is up to each participant in the network to validate each transaction and block on their own.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:09:06
Yup exactly. A bitcoin transaction is a list of inputs (previous locks you are unlocking), and a list of outputs (locks you are creating)
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:41:41

yes you should be fine now, but eventually you will want to move the coins on each chain to different addresses to prevent the relay attack (for when you want to transfer them to an address you don't control)
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:28:54
Yes. Basically what would happen during a fork is your private keys would control bitcoin on each of the 2 forks. Any wallet should be ok if you can extract the private key or seed from it. The main things to know:
1. Some exchanges are choosing to simply ignore the fork, and only use your private key on one of the chains. This is the main reason to hold your own private keys.
2. When you make a transaction on one chain, it is possible for anybody to copy your transaction and replay it on the other chain. This isn't a problem if you still own the output address on each chain, but if you are making a payment to someone, they could copy the transaction to the other chain and be paid in the other currency as well.
That's it. Don't be scared of a fork. It is a feature of crypto, not a bug.

Ya, decentralized decision making is not as clean as having the government do it for us. If the drama scares you, you should wait 5-10 years until we can finish laying the ground work for what crypto will become.
Don't be confused, the people in power have no power over bitcoin. Any fork that occurs will be because of each and every person's individual decision to use either coin. If they make a fork with poor technology, the market should see no value in it. Sure, the big players have more media influence and can swing everyone's vote a bit, but a vote is not permanent. That is opposed to the current fiat system, where the big players make the decision and you must follow it.
Its not perfect, but far better than what we've got. This event will likely be the same as every previous scary bitcoin event, everyone worries about it for a few months, and then later it will seem like just a small blip it history.

The public key is actually useful in that you will know when you've guessed the correct private key, rather than having to check a block explorer after every hash guess attempt. However, you are still missing a large portion of the key... about 40 characters worth depending on how the key was encoded. You better hope that QR code portion holds a substantial hint or this is probably out of the range of brute force attempts.

A fork is a beautiful feature of blockchains, not some scary bug. It allows the technology to evolve and improve as new demands and possibilities are discovered, while remaining decentralized with everyone having a vote. You shouldn't think it is forking from such a negative view, it is forking because two groups both see amazing different ways the technology can be improved, and now each person can place their vote (value/money/trust) into what improvement they think is best.
It is only a scary thing to people that are not accustomed to having a say in how their money works, and instead having someone else make the decisions for them.
