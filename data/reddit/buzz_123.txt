that's a good part of what leads me to believe that would happen

Wow... ok... I'm quite content to be wrong :) because I just learned something today. I'm also going to leave my post instead of deleting it to save my pride, because someone else who was similarly misinformed could have their own misconception corrected. Let's be nice to each other here and remember the first line in reddiquette:
Remember the human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself "Would I say it to the person's face?" or "Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?"

I was just stepping in to help someone out with what I thought was a misconception... then had my own misconception corrected... which is fine by me :) I honestly feel we've got better things to debate than this schoolyard stuff.
Essentially you're arguing over whether I should have said "I'm pretty sure that..." on the front of my post or not, which to me sounds more condescending.
I was wrong. I got corrected. I learned something. I walk away from this happy, and actually pretty fascinated to read more in-depth about contracts. Only someone with serious self-esteem issues has such a dread of being, or being seen to be, wrong. Let's remember who the real enemy is guys. Clue: it's not each other.

Don't get it, I'm just saying it doesn't make sense. Small petty things like petitioning stop signs just doesn't strike me as something that "the" satoshi would do.

It definitely does matter. A transaction fee of 6 cents is actually quite large compared to historically. Whenever the fee reaches up into being many times more than a cent that has a real impact on the cost of making small sales. It means anything below $2 is a worse transaction fee then credit card

I stand corrected. I'll look it up :)

Because the libertarian-minded architect of a new monetary system is concerning himself with the minutea of local government... doesn't make any sense that this guy is "the" satoshi.

There's no such thing as an "m-of-n address" each bitcoin address is as secure as any other. You can do m-of-n transactions, but that just involves n addresses, m of which need to sign it.

This still assumes that a market price has been discovered. My main interest is in how we could engineer the discovery mechanism
@_date: 2014-03-15 10:28:56
Cheers Gavin :) I wasn't expecting to get an answer from you, that's why this community is awesome. So if I understand correctly, the price discovery comes from balancing out people's time preference because if it's too high more people will elect to wait a little longer, and vice versa.

That's all very well but what's the mechanism for price discovery
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:31:37
I'm interested in how it would function though. Price discovery would be difficult and being below market rate by accident would cause hassle
