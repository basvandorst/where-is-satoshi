you didn't even say what your idea was?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:21:34
Explain how that makes any sense 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:29
As I've already commented. Yes I am.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:11
Its use as a mostly untraceable currency that no government can control, that my opinion though. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:42:50
I'll make my money back in 1.8 months according to my math, reinvesting all the money I make from it back into itself.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:46:52
Can relate, I talk about bitcoin way too much in everyday conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:32:01
Merry Christmas my friend 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:59:17
Nobody in my family thinks bitcoin is real... lol guess they're missing out 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:21:12
That's what I hope to see my friend, everyone who's said "bitcoin will crash", or "it's all just a ponzi scheme" to bit their tounge in regret.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:12:03
It's to be expected in the beginning 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:06:41
Got a haircut today, tried to talk to the woman cutting my hair about bitcoin and she said it was a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:14:09
I actually did read a lot of reviews, didn't really see a lot of negative ones. And most of the negative ones were just people who invested into zcash and got mad cause they lost their money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:06:53
Thanks, and same to you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:18:11
First of all it's "want" not "whant"
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:56:58
You have the right idea 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:56:09
Yes, I'm relatively new to all this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:33
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:52:20
Yes, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:10
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:20:07
Have you done any research on Hashflare at all before making such a bold statement?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:10
Butterfly effect?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:15
As the price shoots up lmao I love bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:39:51
Call it how I see it 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:04
Thanks for the laugh &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:20
Also, If you don't mind me asking, how much have you invested?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:35:44
Best of luck on your bitcoin adventures my friend 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:06:03
Yeah, and...?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:22:59
NOTE: The reason I'm investing into cloud mining is because I want to have passive income coming everyday, plus my paycheck from my job.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:24
Very true, keep hodling my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:10
Only 1 way to find out if it's real. That's why I didn't invest a stupid big amount of money
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:57:00
Thanks man! Much love, will definitely keep what you said in mind.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:27:28
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:33:10
Oh boy...
