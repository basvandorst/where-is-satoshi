So much still to be adjusted and determined when it comes to the system as it sits currently. No one can avoid Uncle Sam and it’s just not worth it if you try. I appreciate your input and see where you’re coming from!

FDIC-insured = have to collect personal info
It’s a first generation product. It will only get better with time meaning less invasive. I want decentralization just as much as you do. You want mass adoption? Ease the masses into it with products exactly like this. Fiat and crypto ramps are huge. Its a game, play it right. 
It’s Venmo with a UI/UX that is 10x better plus you get awarded each time you send money. If that doesn’t have you sold then you should re-examine why you’re involved in this industry to begin with.

I think it’s important to realize that teams are taking steps to build out robust products. These are all steps on the right direction. It’s good to know that privacy is on their radar, even if it may not be the best version of it. From a UX perspective, keep in mind that easing people into things is the best method for mass adoption. Throwing everything at them at once: not so much.
