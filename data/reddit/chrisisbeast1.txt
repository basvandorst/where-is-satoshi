Can the mods ban this Dingus. Read his profile for a sec, its just idiocy.

While it is being made, can we call it a Dorian?

My sides. They hurt.

Might not be best to click that link. Two anti-viruses found that this sitewasn't good.

This is going to likely get down voted, I know that and I can deal with it. But at the end of the day, community is important. When I asked my first questions about BitCoin most people were saying "Google it, moron. Don't get involved in crypto if you are too stupid to do that much". You know, when you want to get into a new thing you don't want people screaming at you for a lack of knowledge. However, when I had questions about dogecoin people answered and were kind. That is the difference. That is what is important.

I imagine that as it becomes more unprofitable then people are going to have to make better asics that are going to make it profitable again.

I hate to say it dude, I feel bad because that hard work was sort of wasted. But, I would say that you might want to start doing some android development. What kind of app was it? If it was a wallet, I highly doubt that apple is going to allow it to fly.

That's really cool. I am actually from Providence, I think they might have came from the Lends Crafter's, saw a similar pair when I went in to purchase a pair. 
Also, 401 represent!

Nope. I have RBS (well, owned by RBS, its called Citizens Bank here), those hours seem about right.

So, this might sound like a bit of a noob thing, but what kind of places use Square Market? I haven't heard of them before, till now. So what are some types of stores that I would now be able to spend my bitcoin at?

My uncle had been burglarized. He had 2000 dollars emergency cash, gold and silver jewelry. When he was broken into, the police could do virtually nothing because the gold and gets melted down and the cash gets put away somewhere

Ally bank also refunds all ATM withdrawals

How dare you not know everything that I know?!

I would encourage anyone who is looking to get into bitcoin to open an account with a credit union.  Here in my state, one of the more well known ones is navigant credit union. They are really good, and when I went to open up the account I had told them that it would be used for bitcoin and online transactions. When I told them this they told me something along the lines of "Yeah, that is totally fine, I would just say that you should be careful where you buy from and make sure that they are keeping your information very secure" but other than that, they were totally cool with it. Most credit unions are good, but the only down side is that most of them aren't FDIC, so if they go belly up, you are kind of out of luck.

Judging from the screen shot, that looks like what I am looking for.

One thing about Google is that they have always been quite good at handling competitions. Like they said, Google has got Google wallet, but they allow for bitcoin wallets. They do this quite often. Just think about the loads of different browsers, launchers, and other stuff that competes with their own stuff, but they still want to be made. Google accepts innovation, but it looks like Apple wants to live in their own monopoly.

These people deserve to pay for bodyguards for him. That is totally wrong. Even if the guy isn't Satoshi, he is  going to get watched by everyone. They deserve to pay for his protection.

Another reason to keep your coins off of your computer.
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:49:17
any other ones you got? This seems really difficult. I am really quite new to bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:48:31
Yeah I agree with the DDoS stand point. Now, any scriptkiddie can download some program and use it to take down a small website.
Not that Bitstamp is small, but I think that you get the idea...
@_date: 2013-10-09 20:49:28
Oh something that I forgot, should I just get this instead?
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:59:11
From what I gather, unless you are investing in bitcoin's and then selling them, you are not going to making much of anything. I am doing this much more for the fun of it.
@_date: 2013-09-19 01:08:08
Also, to be quite honest I am going to have to retire this because I do not feel to safe at 167 F or 75 C when ever I am bitcoin mining
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:48:06
I don't know about that, but I see your point. Either way it is interesting to see that I can finally get a BTC ATM come to my area. Living in New England, I have to get most of my bitcoins via exchanges and because bitcoin is constantly changing sometimes times before I get them in my wallet, the price has already changed. You know what I am saying?
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:27:53
Yes. I am mining for fun. And trust me, mining isn't all that profitable unless I am able to drop big money of some hardware. Currently my GPU is only 45 mega hashes. Thanks :D
@_date: 2013-09-21 11:48:06
Thanks man. Going to get that...Thanks again bud!
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:15:22
Thanks! Yeah these look good!  Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-09-09 19:34:07
Ok, so what if I were to get one of [these] ( Would that be making things much better?
@_date: 2013-09-09 02:49:32
Using the nvidia 550ti
@_date: 2013-09-09 21:09:10
To be quite honest, I am doing this more as a hobby...
@_date: 2013-09-21 01:14:19
The fact that utorrent does that pisses me off to no end. If someone could make a program that makes that unchecked every time I would install something, that would be awesome. I have not got the smallest idea on how they would do it but...
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:52:38
Wow, thank you very much. Thank you! I think I know what it is that I will be doing now. I think that I am going to wait for those things to go down a bit. Not sure what it is that I will wait for but I will wait for them to go down. then I think that i will get them. The Pi seems interesting because I do enjoy using Linux (Ubuntu is my favorite distro) so I think that I will get that soon too. I am going to attempt to find a guide online on how to make a Pi into a bitcoin miner. thanks man you were a lot of help. I have been meaning to get one of those for a while but I now have got a proper reason to get one.
@_date: 2013-09-09 23:56:23
No, I actually think that I sounded like a dick. Nah, I just wanted to say, I dont have intentions of living off of bitcoins. I more so want to do it because I think that it would be cool do get into. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:25:47
Nah, I have the galaxy s4, which is a decently new phone...
@_date: 2013-09-21 11:47:31
Yeah I think that I might look into it. I understand what the point of adware is but that does not like the company better. It just makes me say "so your the idiots who put adware on this and messed with my browser...BYE!"
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:04:21
Being that my state is small (think you can guess which one it is) I have got nearly no one around who sells them.
