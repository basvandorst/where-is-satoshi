I'll happily use tokens issued by Chuck E Cheese to play skee-ball and other games and its fine establishments.

Yes.  Tax-wise they're no better or worse off.
It's no different than if the business paid the employee in gold or gave a bonus of a new car.  The value (in dollars) of what's given to the employee is taxed at the same rate as if she had been given dollars.

On the one hand, it could go up, which would make it a good investment. On the other hand, it may go down, which would make it a bad investment.

I have absolutely no idea. I care about the price in 10 years. It will go up and down a lot between now and then.

Why do I care what this guy thinks?
In 2016, they didn’t see a future in Bitcoin so turned it off and focused on payments and messaging. 
In the past year, they’ve gutted all of their crypto offerings, the saddest of which was their OTC desk which had been one of the best.

I love Bitcoin but don’t listen to VCs when they shill things they invested in. Tim Draper said these quotes about his investment Theranos, after it was exposed as a scam:
Theranos was attacked by journalists “the way Uber was attacked by taxi drivers, and Bitcoin was attacked by the banks. I hope eventually whoever is pulling the wires for the guy at The Wall Street Journal—I hope they finally cut his wires.”
“We have taken down another great icon.”
“She got bullied into submission.”
“Wait. Why is it worthless? It’s worthless because this writer was like a badger going after her, like a hyena going after her, and then it became a bigger and bigger thing.”

Bitcoin is made illegal. All internet traffic to nodes is blocked. Bitcoin mines are shut down; if you're caught running one you'll be put in jail. Owning or using BTC is banned and you'll be put in jail if caught (and coin confiscated).
Likely at some point they launch their own coin tied to their currency ("RMBCoin") which is permitted.

You know what even more criminal activity is done in? Paper fiat currency.
