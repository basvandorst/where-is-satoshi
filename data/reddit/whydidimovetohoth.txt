I don't think he is yet. Guys, it's May 2015. Don't be sending a nutjob your BTC just because he accepts it right now. I'd imagine more candidates will accept it in the coming months, because why would they say no to free money? Well, unless you're Shillary Clinton and took hundreds of millions from Wall St. already. Rand Paul is not Ron Paul. Don't be deceived. At the very least, before sending him your BTC, read where he stands on the issues. I will say that he's the most reasonable candidate out of the GOP so far, but that's like saying you're the smartest person at the Special Olympics.

Shout out to I'll take my downvotes from the libertarian/anarchist crowd here now for supporting a Democratic Socialist, but I'd just like to say that everyone should support independent candidates outside the establishment. I voted for Ron Paul in 2012 despite being a leftist, because it doesn't matter to me if another candidate says things I agree with more when they're unfathomably corrupt. Shillary has taken hundreds of millions from the banks. The Republican candidates... Do I even need to go there? Rand Paul is the only one that doesn't make me want to vomit, but he's still a Tea Party nutter with none of the principles of his father. 
If we have a third Bush, I'm seriously leaving this country. The first two raped our country enough, and now the Republicans are trying to elect the bastard that allowed his brother to steal Florida?

There's also the similarity that they're both centralized services that were/will be the precursor to a peer-to-peer system which is/will be far more difficult to shut down. I wonder if OpenBazaar will be the BitTorrent of drugs... No army can stop an idea whose time has come. The War on Drugs needs to be ended.

Did that fascist motherfucker seriously just compare putting men on the moon to creating a global surveillance state? One of those is arguably the greatest accomplishment mankind has ever made. The other is something mankind should strive to never accomplish.
On another note, I'm glad we're finally starting to see congressmen with technical backgrounds. These old fuckers who can't even send an email need to die off already. They have no idea that they're playing with fire. I mean, if all US products continue to be backdoored, AWS and others are just going to outsource to Switzerland. IMO, one of the main things holding up the house of cards that is the US economy is the tech sector. Force them overseas with draconian laws, and the US empire is basically finished. I don't want to see that happen.

Would you use PayPal or any other regulated financial service to buy drugs? No? Then why would you use Coinbase? This guy got what he deserved, IMO. Fucking idiot. 
We can argue all day on the merits of these laws, and I'd agree that they're unjust, but you people are delusional for blaming Coinbase for this. Every other day there's a front page post saying "Fuck Coinbase, they follow federal law." I really don't know what you people expect. Do you think it's a bad thing that everyday customers can acquire BTC easily for legal purposes, like instantaneous, affordable international remittances, or obtaining financial services in developing countries? Those are the types of use cases that got me most excited about BTC, not buying drugs online. But hey, let's keep raising our pitchforks and attack one of the major players in this space almost daily. I'm sure it's great for the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin!

It's par for the course for Lawsky. That fucker banned Lyft and Uber in Rochester and Buffalo last summer. In case you didn't know, Rochester taxis are fucking terrible. They show up late, if at all, and make people miss flights constantly. They're racist as hell, and they charge exorbitant amounts of money for a 10 minute drive to the airport from the local colleges. I despise Lawsky. He's never been elected, his office didn't exist until that corrupt piece of shit Cuomo got elected, and he's made a career out of stifling innovation everywhere he goes. His office was supposed to go after the banks and fine them for illegal behavior, but going after startups is easier, I guess.

There is something to be said for making it a temporary fix intentionally. This ecosystem is progressing so quickly. The uses of Bitcoin may make another scalability solution more practical in five years, but in those five years, people have been building code on top of the assumption that blocksize won't be limited anymore. 
Karpeles' idea is interesting, but I'm not sure it's the best solution. The conservative nature of bitcoin core development could lead to the blocksize never being revisited again, which could make centralization inevitable due to the increased cost of running a full node.

It's still in *beta*. Let's get it working properly on OSes that don't have massive security flaws first. Honestly, all you people using Bitcoin software on Windows are fucking insane.  I couldn't care less about the whole OS war. I have Windows on my desktop for gaming, but goddamn, if you can't figure out how to install an Ubuntu partition on your PC, your feedback probably won't be that useful at this stage of development anyhow.

I think you're discounting the elegance of how Bitcoin manages public/private keypairs in a pseudo-anonymous manner. IBM and others wouldn't be so interested if there wasn't some value there. I don't think it'll be a purely-centralized system like traditional databases where one party controls access to that information. I think they're thinking more along the lines of "how do we make a common standard for communication between IoT devices?" For instance, how can a Samsung washing machine identify and interact with an LG dryer? If we have smart coffee kiosks instead of baristas, how can you identify that machine, pay for it, and the machine will know it has been paid? How can you make it work with all CC providers and all coffee machine manufacturers? Don't limit your imagination here. IBM doesn't seem to be... Currency and smart contracts are just the first applications thought of for the Bitcoin protocol, IMO.

The problem with this is that someone still needs to run the physical infrastructure, and that someone is always a centralized entity, as far as I know. Someone needs to construct and maintain the fiber, satellite, phone lines, cell towers, or cable connections to the router that you connect to in a meshnet to connect to so you can connect to the rest of the world. Otherwise, it's just a large-scale LAN. If Comcast wants to throttle any connections that aren't on their whitelist, it doesn't matter if you connect to them through your router or your neighbor's router. It'd only work if Netflix or another company had a server within the meshnet, or if the operator of the meshnet used some cryptography to thwart Comcast's whitelisting.
People come up with technical workarounds regarding net neutrality and the NSA's treasonous behavior,  but ultimately, these are political problems, and they should be treated as such. You shouldn't use a machete to chop down a tree when you have an axe. These political problems are going to be easier to solve politically than technically. Even a revolution would probably be easier than making a meshnet work to stop the telco's greed. Hell, it's probably easier to form an angry mob in Philly to burn down Comcast's headquarters than making this work... To any NSA agents reading this, I'm not advocating that. I'm just saying that meshnets are a round peg to the square hole problem of net neutrality. Meshnets are a better solution to the problem of fascist governments shutting down the Internet during a protest, like what we saw in HK, or during a war when communications infrastructure is limited or destroyed. It's not a way to decentralize the global Internet. They're local networks by definition.

One could argue that the invention of the atomic bomb prevented World War 3 since if superpowers went to war again, it would likely mean the end of the human race. Also, nuclear energy is one of our best bets to reduce carbon emissions substantially, especially in the developing world.

I'm not worried about the latter. Do you think Coinbase or Circle want to become the next Paypal/Google Wallet/Apple Pay/Venmo/Square/Stripe clone? The problem with closed systems is that they're not compatible with one another. I can't send money through Google Wallet to my friend who has a Paypal account, and nobody wants to install five different payments apps on their phone. The advantage of Bitcoin is that it's an open protocol that Coinbase, Circle, etc can all build on top of. I can send BTC to my friend regardless of what wallet I'm using.

Solution: the merchant passes some of their savings on Visa's transaction fees and elimination of chargebacks onto their customers in the form of a small discount for using Bitcoin. Does a credit card transaction cost you less than $46.75/$45.95 = 1%? I'd imagine the answer is almost certainly "yes," unless you're Amazon. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:20:38
My point was, it hasn't gone below $200 since the Coinbase news hit. We're up ~35% since then. Yes, the price is volatile and fluctuated a bit in the past month in the 200-300 range. That's what Bitcoin does. I'm not sure how you can argue that Coinbase was just a pump and dump altogether, though. What do you expect, a 200% gain in a month? Get real. Willy is gone. The market reacted to the news, it retraced, and it didn't break through $200 again. Here's hoping the same happens for $240 with this news.

That's easy. The US government needs a new excuse to go to war. ISIS is making it very easy to justify another invasion of Iraq. Why would Obama want to stop it? ISIS is helping the military-industrial complex sway public opinion into another war. We gave them weapons back in Syria. Obama didn't get his Syrian war, but he's probably gonna get Iraq, Round 3. Mind you, I don't think we have much of a choice in fighting ISIS when we're the reason they exist in the first place. That'd be some supervillian shit: destroying an entire country, and letting the rest of the world clean up the mess...

You don't know anything about startups... No sane startup company would willingly lose a customer by choice over a $50 purchase. They have $75 million in capital. They need growth, not saving $10 through cancelling orders.

The currency exchange rate listed above is approximately 1%. If you run an online business that spends less than 1% on each transaction after fees and losses to fraudulent chargebacks, you're either Amazon, or you deserve a fucking medal. That being said, there's a cost to implement Bitcoin payments, and there need to be enough users to cover that cost.  That gap is quickly being bridged, though. I'm not sure how it doesn't make economic sense to offer a 2% Bitcoin discount to save on 4% in traditional payments. It's like what the credit card companies do with their rewards programs. They give you 1% cash back after charging the merchant 2-4%. These margins introduce deadweight loss into the economy. It's just that it's hidden to your everyday consumers. Bitcoin-accepting merchants should be exposing those hidden costs by offering a discount. It's no different than the gas stations that offer a cash discount. Incentivize your customers to lower your fees. It's simple economics.

Besides, this is a sophisticated attack that requires access to hard drive manufacturers. NK is basically a failed state that's propped up by foreign aid out of fear. They don't have the ability to pull this off. The war hawks in Congress like making NK seem like this huge threat to America, but the only reason they're even relevant on the world stage is because their country is run by madmen within bombing distance of Seoul. They're not a threat to the US or even China or Japan. They are a significant threat to SK, though.

Trezor is an embedded device, so it doesn't have a hard drive. SatoshiLabs doesn't have any info on flash memory on their website, so it seems they're just using the on-board memory with their CPU (ARM Cortex M3). This is outside the scope of this leak in particular, but at this point, I'm assuming the NSA has compromised just about everything we use on a hardware level (and every level above that), including Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs. They've been doing this shit since at least the early 1990s, starting with the Clipper chip at the latest. Snowden said if a device is ever connected to a network, the NSA owns it, and I see no reason to think he's not telling the truth at this point. Basically, we're rapidly approaching a 1984 scenario (Samsung even makes telescreens now), and I'm not sure what can be done to stop it.
That being said, I doubt the NSA is interested in stealing your BTC. Also, there's absolutely no such thing as perfect security when you're talking about nation-state level adversaries. They have essentially limitless funding (if Congress doesn't give them enough money, just sell crack to the inner cities or guns to the cartels). It's not something I'd really worry about on a personal level unless you're funding ISIS or running a darknet market right now. It's terrifying what these fucking traitors will be able to do as Moore's Law continues to hold true, though. I think Orwell will be remembered as an optimist at this rate, if he's remembered at all.
