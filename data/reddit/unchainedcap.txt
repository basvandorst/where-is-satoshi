Yes, it can be installed and run on an airgapped computer. It can generate addresses by manually pasting public keys, or with a Ledger/Hermit, but Trezor requires communicating with Trezor connect. For signing/spending, it needs to connect to either a personal node or blockstream.info to get consensus and broadcast. Signing with a Trezor again requires connecting to Trezor Connect.

Thanks u/mark_bear! We've invested a lot of time to produce (hopefully helpful) content for our fellow bitcoiners!

Our platform leverages Trezors and Ledgers in a 2-of-3 multisignature quorum. Multisignature is more secure than any single signature hardware wallet because it reduces the risks of single recovery seed loss or unforeseen individual hardware wallet bugs.

Caravan is open-source and stateless, meaning users are not interacting at all with Unchained Capital (or any other company) when using it to create and spend from multisignature addresses. It's the easiest way to create your own quorums without interacting with any company.

Thanks for your questions! 
Minimums and all loan terms are subject to change, but as of this writing, Unchained's minimum loan loan size is $10k, interest rates are 10-14% APR and all of the collateral is returned to the client so they can keep any gains.  
If you're asking from the position of a lending capital provider we'd be glad to chat - just email us at hello

Thank you! Hermit is designed to be an alternative to a hardware wallet for groups of people protecting a single private key. On the Unchained Capital multisig vault platform, Hermit can be used to protect private keys in a quorum of 3 keys; the other two could be hardware wallets. We have no plans at the moment to release a GUI, but it's open source, so if someone really wants a GUI they are welcome to write it. Hermit is designed to be run on hardware even more limited than a raspberry pi, which is how we hope to use it once SLIP-0039 has had more time to mature.

Hey - sorry about the late response! There's a good discussion of our offerings and SALT in the Flippening podcast episode  Primarily, we do not have a token and tend to work closely with our customers. Loans can typically get disbursed within a few days. Happy to speak more if you'd like more details.
