I mean it's actually pretty good advice depending on how you look at it.  It can be interpreted as market at record highs, take some profits now.  What he probably means is the market is a good investment for new money which is ill advised imo.

Let's just completely ignore the energy cost of gold or any other currency.  I'm sure strip mining, refining, and managing portfolio grade gold has little to no cost or energy and is definitely not used for illicit activity.  Give me a break.

A whale in position would have already done all their buying.  Something I've noticed over the last few days, low volume, lots of small panic selling, and a few rather large purchases, price range very low.  Over the past 24hrs, the exchange I use has had volume 3x, no large orders, just smaller buy orders going through.  If I were a whale and believed a big price hike was incoming I would be calculating where I wanted to start selling to anticipate the correction of a bull run.

This is how I gauge the value of BTC.  I calculate all the amount of people working on the network, the machines and cost of maintaining everything.  Add on top of that an asset that cannot be devalued by government monetary policy.  Add on top of that money that cannot be prevented from moving anywhere in the world regardless of policy and war.  I see it undervalued in market price.  
As far as using it as a currency there are many solutions and innovations right around the corner.  Lighting Network and platforms like ETH are looking to make everyday transactions much quicker cheaper and faster.  
This technology hasn't even existed for more that a dozen years, and arguable some of the largest hurdles have already been surpassed.  The full scale adoption might be faster than you think.

Just another blowhard troll.  Even if Chinese State Government achieves 51% of the mining network (which is what I guess If I was Caesar meant), they would be extremely limited in what they would be able to do to the network.  They would be able to (with extreme difficulty) validate their own blocks and possibly alter their trades (and only alter a trade within 10 min before the next block is set).  They still wouldn't be able to create more tokens or alter any other transaction that weren't their own.  Also if anyone achieves 51% and starts doing fucky things like that the entire network would become aware pretty damn quick.

How much deviation from this chart would BTC need to make this chart no longer valid?   If we went back to 4k before 2020?  or on the other hand if it broke 1million in 2021?

On a basic level bitcoin encourages good actors and discourages bad ones.  Someone who builds any type of super computer has more to gain by adding to the hash function and earning block rewards, than trying to do something nefarious and possibly forking the network.

Hypothetically speaking, If I was able to time the market at the top, and wanted to short Bitcoin, would I be better off using Bakkt Physical bitcoin futures, Bakkt cash settled futures, CME?

China seems too pragmatic to give up a foothold in an emerging market.  I doubt they would ban mining just on that alone.

My issue isn't with liquidity.  What I mean is sell off my stack at the top, then take the physical cash from sold stack to bet on short future contracts.

following supply/demand economics if demand remains constant or increases and supply decreases, price will increase.

I read an article about this and it really isn't a problem.  Each Bitcoin is divisible by 100000000 Satoshis.  Even with only 1 bitcoin in the system it would still function as a system.  Every bitcoin getting lost would be pretty much impossible because with every coin lost the value of existing coins goes up.  People store on exchanges, wallets, and cold storage.

Which exchange has the lowest fees?  I thought it was Bittrex with .25%.
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:24:39
Not being facetious at all.  Every time there is price drop people always try to pinpoint the event that caused it.  I am just saying the only real thing that drives the price up and down is how much is being bought and sold.  Clearly the market has sold more than it bought recently.
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:24:03
Coins that have lost keys are essentially lost forever.  Those coins cannot be bought or sold.  They no longer are in the supply.

Can someone explain why someone, who is not invested in bitcoin, waste all the time and effort to comment on every single bitcoin article to bash it with absolutely no information to back their claim?  
I don't invest in gold.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to waste my time by seeking out gold articles on the internet and bashing it in the comment section.  
Are they trolls?  Do they have nothing better to do with their time?  What do they stand to gain?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:02:32
I think it comes down to what kind of investor is buying.  I personally believe in the technology and understand what kind of impact a decentralized currency can have on every economy around the world.  But, there are a lot of people who chase the price.  These people fit more into your gambling example.  
I really enjoy that we can have a civilized conversation about this without it turning into Pro BTC blowhard VS Anti BTC Blowhard.
@_date: 2019-09-21 05:29:49
I disagree.  The coins exist, but since no one has the keys they cannot be used.  Not now or ever will those lost bitcoin keys be used to bring those coins into the supply.  They are different from people hoarding since those coins are still technically in the supply although not currently being traded.  Any coin with keys is in the supply.  Coins without keys will never reenter the supply.  Only coins with lost keys are removed from the supply.
It's like the movie Gold Finger.  He contaminates Fort Knox and even though all the gold in the vault is still there, it is essentially useless since no one can handle or use it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:48:48
Losing money in investments all depends on when you buy and sell.  It is very possible to have lost money in gold if you bought at the peak in 1979 (2000.00) and sold in 2001 (390.00).  Currently the only people who have lost money in bitcoin are the ones that only bought during the peak price in 2017 and sold after the crash.  Anyone who bought before 2017 or after the crash is massively in the black.  Also anyone who invests with DCA is also in the black. 
From my experience, Bitcoin gets people who have never managed a portfolio investing for the first time in one of the most volatile markets.
As far as McAfee I think we can globally agree that he is a totally nut.  However crazy he is, there is no denying that he is an intelligent technologist who understands the potential Bitcoin has in the finance sector.
