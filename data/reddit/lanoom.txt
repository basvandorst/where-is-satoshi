They think crypto currencies are all a scam; used primarily for money laundering and illicit activities.  They will never get past that. I would not bring it up with your family because you will look foolish.

 Intried making a threaf of this comment but my post was removed . Anyway.... Everyone who has been following crypto for at least the last few weeks , months or even years knows who Rodger Ver is.  He's become the influential vulture that is preying on the amateurs of the market to invest in BitcoinCash instead of BTC. He's now been accused of inside trading and manipulated his way into coinbase.  He has doubled  or even tripled his networth by getting out of btc and getting more BCC coins and raising the price with manipulation to the masses.  In the long run he will never succeed.   As a crypto enthusiast we must stand tall to the rise of greed and manipulation , and understand why we are here. We are investing in the future of blockchain technology . This is a revolution.  Let's not let a greedy few get in the way and stifile Innovation! BTC will always be number one if  crypto wants to survive long term. Who's with me?!!

BCC is the biggest scam in the crypto industry, and all the newbies fall for it over and over again.

All I keep seeing is posts of this and Bitcoin ATM machines . This is the best the BTC community can come up with?

Another Charlie Lee cultist fan boy?  LTC was a copy of BTC we all know that.   LTC serves the same purpose as BCash.

BCASH and LTC are missing on this list. Please update the list.

It's 2019 and this is the best the crypto community can come up with?  Stop posting random BTC ATms around the world that no one cares about.

All the Faces in crypto like Roger Ver, and Charlie Lee have been awful so far. We are better without one.

3k is the bottom not 10k

I bet most people on this subreddit have most of their net worth in BTC and a little bit in Eth. They will all get burned again . You should only investment up to 5% of your net worth into these kinds of assets.

Bought in at 20k. Hodl, Hodl, Hodl, Hodl, Hodl, Hodl, Hodl, Hodor.
