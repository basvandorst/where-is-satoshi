I use the cashapp. Its quick and simple. I have quite a few friends who have invested significant amounts of money using this app, never had a problem. They have added and withdrawn money with no issues. Nor have I so far until I noticed this difference between mine and my wife's amount now vs amount invested.

I use the cashapp to invest. It is basically setup like an account.

 You always talk to people this way? Yet another keyboard warrior in moms basement thinking they know everything and everyone. What you may know, some people may not, and vice versa. It's ok to ask questions. It's not ok to act like you're better than someone because you know something they dont. 
You are flat out wrong, btw. All the data I've seen puts the value very close from the time of her investment, to mine. Almost exact actually. 
I hope you find some happiness in your life so you dont need to lash out and talk down to strangers. Obviously something is wrong in your life so you need to comfort yourself by insulting someone for no reason. Good luck you. I wish you could have helped me, but not everybody is capable.

Just like the other one. Another moms basement keyboard warrior. Do you think talking down to someone is helpful when they are trying to learn something? Is this how you usually talk to other people, call them stupid when they ask a question? You're very helpful, thanks. I'll go ask someone else. Thanks though.
