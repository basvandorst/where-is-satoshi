You have been goxxed.

Good luck!

It's as easy as removing MtGox for one week and then see if bitcoin world continues. Of course it will but by then nobody will miss Gox

Does it support checking transactions by txid? :d

Tx malleability is also very popular in these days!
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:03:11
Yes, thanks! :)

Great video!
My doubt is still how the miner knows how many transactions must be in every block. Does it stop adding them after 10 minutes? Does it stop when the correct hash is found? I understand that every time a new transaction is added to the tree, the merkle root changes and so the whole process of discovering the nonce for that block has to start again. What am I missing?

Thanks for this sentence and the roulette wheel example!

As far as I know magento and that plugin are free software so you could escrow some coins in order to encourage some developer to fix it. 
Fund what will benefit you! :)

Has Mt.Gox ever recognized one of their faults?
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:46:58
Doesn't reddit have a bot for that?!

I also think about a bank account as a multisignature bitcoin address where the bank has one of the 1-of-2 keys needed to use the account. And these are the only accounts that the bank will provide you! Crazy. Isn't it?

Same here but I entered this community some months before than you and I even had the pleasure to experience April 2013's bubble :D

Wait... Do you need to enter your ID card???
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:15:56
Not really as the government just orders the bank what to do. They don't even need to be part of the multisig.  I see it more like 1-of-2 where the bank shares publicly his private key with his bosses.
But yes I have though about that scenario too!

So the idea of paying to sign up is his.
He's a finance genius!

Tx malleability and now THIS. 
Definitely Bitcoin is broken :(

Why are people downvoting it?
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:10:26
And remember to sign it with some just generated PGP key!

Apology accepted
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:08:51
Same here too. What a bad move. Didn't they really think about the consequences?

"Falciani looks to be basically ratting out "tax evaders," ie, people who want to keep their rightfully earned money, and as a result has effectively expanded the power of the State"
Please don't make me laugh. 
Switzerland is the tax heaven of Europe. It's not individuals who hide their rightfully earned money there but politicians and banksters who hide the money they have made from corruption and weapons traffic.
Thanks to Falciani, we know that very powerful people like Emilio Botin (the Executive Chairman of Spain's Grupo Santander) has money in Switzerland and thanks to him, Botin has had to pay taxes (just 200M €!) for some of his money stolen illegalyand unethically from his bank.
I don't get what's the point for defending this kind of people.
