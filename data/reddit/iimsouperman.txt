You realise you're a pretentious cunt who needs to grow up?
Of course you come across as a moron - You're the one that's mad.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:58:59
Well judging by your replies, you can't argue with anything.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:32:45
seems like you are really desperate for this to be a fake thread, and for the news week story to be true.
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:39:35
Apologies. I forgot disliking and egomaniac makes me a cunt. You dislike me, and some would argue I'm extremely opinionated. Oh the hypocrisy! :D

Your whole "argument" is the exact basis of why he's overrated as fuck.
Your last terrible attempt at "arguing" resulting in some ad hominem bullshit just shows how right I am. Thanks.

Quick question a friend asked me via Facebook, I don't really have an actual answer to it myself...
Maybe one of you guys could shed some light?
"What i dont get about bitcoin is (STEAMING generalizations incoming) its trying to put money in control of the poeple rather than the government. Pretty sure the combined computing power of all governments could quite easily mine everything within days? so again, the 1% of users would hold 99% of the wealth?"

Nailed it. I don't see why people were so naive to accept 22 months withdrawl.

Nope, they are a completely ground up architecture, a totally new chip designed specifically for the purpose of mining.

People will downvote the shit out of you for disliking their Bitcoin Prophet. I completely agree with you, can't stand him at all.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:25:07
Drugs + pseudo-intellectualism != really smart. Sure I'd rather have him on my side than the vast majority of humanity, but christ. He gets far too much credit for being an egotistical fuckwit.

Note "We checked the Guardian and Daily Telegraph style books (because they’re available online, not because they’re the most authoritative), and both make the distinction, saying dependant is the noun and dependent the adjective.4 5"
EDIT: He's Brazilian. This thread is irrelevant.
Lmao all the patriots supporting the guy who used HIS OWN GOVERNMENT'S SITES for a sweeping "proof", whilst I used legitimate dictionaries. Fantastic.
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:27:15
Not true. Dependent is an adjective - "I am dependent on drugs".
Dependant is a noun - "I have a dependant".

He's not very good at this.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:01:00
Don't be so aggressive. It's only the internet. I made a simple joke, infact - it was ironically the exact same joke you made, sarcastically aimed at the parent of my comment. You didn't pick up on it, and became offensive. Get over yourself, and move on.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:40:16
Definitely wouldn't be blushing, couldn't care less what he decides to do with his assets.
Far from an mma hater; huge fan actually, and never actually watched Fear factor; I'm not from the US, it's not a big thing in Europe.
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:41:29
I can see exactly how you deduced that. Yes good sir, well done. :|
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:26:01
Just ignore him, he's a tit that thinks everyone should use the crypto HE does so he can benefit the most from it. 
Utterly Pathetic.
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:27:30
I'm sure it is! Because making sweeping judgements about someone; whom of which the only thing you know about is what they comment on an online forum - something which the vast majority of people tend to do in a negative light, is perfectly reasonable and mature.
You're jerking off on an egomaniac and white knighting the fuck out of him because someone has a different opinion about his professional behaviour. 
I think Joe Rogan is a dick, and I write it on a forum. You defend the fuck out of a guy you don't even know, with no premise of knowing I also don't know him (you just jumped in there head first with your dick in his mouth) and that makes ME the 15 year old? You sound like an obsessed Twilight fan. Now who's the child?

Perfect answer, just what I was looking for :)
