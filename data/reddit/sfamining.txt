And I agree, Gox is to blame as well. If not 50%, a very large percentage. But the fact that nobody will take any blame themselves, that's just fucking pathetic. Bunch of sheep.

Did you leave your chips and walk away for a time being, assuming nobody would take them? Because...that's not risk...that's blame, for you being an idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:47:12
You know and knew the risk on both options. And you also knew which was the MORE risky option. Yet you hold no blame for yourself? If you can't face that you made a serious error in judgment and solely hold some dishonest individuals accountable, you're clueless as to how the world really works.

but...that would be the fault of whomever took the gold! Come on now...get that logic outta here!

I have compassion for those who had a small amount of coin, had just started mining/buying, or the small % of those who possibly had deposited for a trade/sale the day the SHTF. That's it. Those who lost such vast amounts deserve absolutely zero compassion except for feeling bad that they're that dumb to have made such money by CLEARLY knowing what they were doing, and yet lost it just as easily for no reason at all.
Yet again, take some fucking responsibility for YOUR choices and YOUR actions (or inaction in this case). This isn't even a crypto issue, it's a life and society argument. There's absolutely zero personal responsibility in our society anymore, and this is a prime example.

A woman who got raped knew it was a 100% possibility that they could at any time? wow...lol nice argument there.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:35:19
It's always 100% someone else's fault. You're right. I'm wrong.
I supposed I'd say that too if I lost over $20,000 like you.
Actually no, I wouldn't. Because I wouldn't have made the choices you made.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:21:24
wow...you just really don't get it, do you? How much did you lose? This was LITERALLY a calculated risk, of which you KNEW that keeping your coin in ANY exchange was about the stupidest fucking thing you could possibly do.
Quit with the fucking retarded examples of which mean absolutely nothing, and accept what happened as what it is. A fucked up situation, that YOU could have mitigated from being affected personally, by making smarter decisions about how you handled your coin.
Goddamn, I didn't think there would be someone that is absolutely the exact example of the type of person described in the first post. Thank you though for proving my point.

This was my first post here after creating an account yesterday...haha. Such an idiot. Go cry yourself to sleep you dipfuck. Yet again I will say, you can be and have every right to be angry at a business that stole money from their users, but you also have much reason to be angry at the fact that:
"You're right, just "best practices" are difficult to follow all of the time" and
"I've heard people say over and over again "don't keep money in online wallets!". And local wallets get hacked all the time.... there just isn't a really safe way to hold money. I mean....you would think that the biggest and most liquid exchange would have been a safe place to hold your coins"
You knew exactly the risk you were taking. AGAIN, hold yourself accountable for the decisions YOU made.
Or don't. By the way, did you know that you don't have to have a job in our society either? The government (and myself) will pay for you to sit on your ass all day.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:39:10
Exactly. The only reason to store at ANY exchange for any amount of time, is if there is no wallet currently (MAX for example). And with such a valuable one as BTC....I just don't get it. Guess this is yet another example of my belief that 90% of our society are fucking morons.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:46:28
HAHAHAHAHA wowwww. You STILL don't fucking get it?? Amazing. Whether illegal or not (casino example), YOU ARE THE FUCKING MORON WHO LEFT THEM THERE.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:36:59
Worthless reply, clearly lost something?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:11:33
Let me ask you this; If you had the choice of putting your money (fiat for this argument) into a FDIC insured bank or a "private" bank that literally gives you no guarantee that they could close shop tomorrow, which would you choose?
I ask you that, because the FDIC insured banks of today...arent guaranteed 100%. Just like our wallets. However, you chose to go with the joe-blow bank that had LITERALLY no guarantee.
That's a little more of a realistic comparison compared to your rape argument.
So actual you're in essence the piece of shit human being who can't think clearly nor take any responsibility for his actions.
