Its not "backed by" the Bitcoin foundation... it is a member of the Bitcoin foundation. Big difference.

ITT: Money Laundering is easy when you don't stick all your goddamn money in one address like the FBI.

They are either going to be destroyed, or sold, or kept unsold for so long everybody thinks they've been destroyed until they are finally sold. 
They aren't going to randomly be given to charity, that would make no sense.

A bitcoin forum is absolutely needed but I do understand why they can't just stick up the old forum again, now. It'll probably just get exploited in the same way by the same people. I still think a read-only forum would be nice, though.

I've seen people go through enormous efforts to receive $5 discounts. I'd think at $1 discount would at least be enough to get them to think of Bitcoin as something other than a "shady currency."

Big shocker.

The cost of conversion back to fiat is at most 1% (bitpay) leading me to my 2% number.

I had a similar issue a couple of months ago. Try --checklevel=2.

So is it possible to troll like this without paying transaction fees? If so, I'd totally do it.

They could, but it would undermine Bitcoin greatly. Sure, the FBI acted uber nooby (seriously, all of that in one address?) but it still wouldn't be good long-term.

They aren't "impossible and pointless" they just have a steep learning curve and are generally more "seller-friendly" than "buyer-friendly".
If you want to buy £100 worth of BTC from the UK, you can either do it the "cheap" way or the "fast &amp; easy" way. The cheap way would be to register at Bitstamp.net or Mtgox.com and send them a bank wire. This can take days and is somewhat complicated, but will get you the most coins for your money.
The "fast &amp; easy" way would be using a service like bitbargain.co.uk. Note: I've never used this particular site before, but I've used American equivalents. 
This is all assuming your money is all offline. If your money is online, in a service like Payza or Perfectmoney, this process is greatly simplified.
