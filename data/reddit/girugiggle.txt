When its doing well all you will get is "Greatest technology ever going to over throw banks" praise for it by people who invested. 
When its doing bad all you will get is "I told you so" from people who havent invested and get extemely jealous when it goes back up.
Either way its somewhat annoying.

It's still really hard for the average person to get into bitcoin. It's not just something you can easily exchange your money over to. Hundreds of wallets. Different Laws per state. Banks/credit cards denying purchases. There's no real one to one across the board that people can get into it. Thats why apps like robinhood are popular. Helps people chase the trend easily
