If your firm paid you in BTC, you could send it home immediately. It wouldn't cost you anything. Sure, there is a fee for your family on the other side to convert it into fiat, which is what would normally happen (at least for now). I can't see how this wouldn't be cheapest option.

The communication satellite was invented by AC Clarke. Others before him (non-state actors) had similar ideas. Industry would have developed the satellite industry independently of government, because mass communication across the globe at the speed of light is an incredibly valuable technology.
The first PC was arguably the Apple I, which had zero government money and almost no private money at first. Go back almost two hundred years and you will discover individuals (non-state actors) were inventing mechanical computers.

Britain to scrap Bitcoin tax
By Jane Wild, Daniel Thomas and Vanessa Houlder
Britain’s tax authority plans to ditch its levy on Bitcoin trading only days after the collapse of Mt Gox, one of the virtual currency’s leading exchanges, losing almost $500m of customer deposits.
The UK’s welcoming approach to Bitcoin contrasts with the approach of other countries, amid concerns about its use for tax evasion and money laundering as well as its notoriety for wide fluctuations in value.
In a meeting with a group of UK traders last week, HM Revenue &amp; Customs said it would not charge the 20 per cent VAT tax on trades, which entrepreneurs had complained made their businesses globally uncompetitive. HMRC went a step further, saying it would not charge the tax on their margins either.
The ruling sidesteps the thorny question of whether to class Bitcoin as a currency, but effectively treats it as such, and bases its policy on the EU law that exempts payments and transfers of “negotiable instruments” from tax.
Governments worldwide have wrestled with the conundrum of how to deal with virtual currencies, as businesses hoping to profit from a small but growing economy have lobbied for regulation that would allow them to flourish.
Singapore has issued tax guidelines for Bitcoin, while an internal US watchdog has criticised the Internal Revenue Service for not doing so.
“If they had added VAT that would have destroyed us, there would have been no point in starting this business at all,” said Jonathan Harrison, who has a start-up working on bringing Bitcoin ATM machines to the UK. “It’s great that the UK authorities are seeing Bitcoin as an innovative technology that can help the economy.”
The European Banking Authority has warned that consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law when using virtual currencies for commercial transactions. China has banned its banks from handling Bitcoin, while Russia and Vietnam have declared transactions illegal.
The decision comes as the Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit advocacy group, told the Financial Times it would redomicile to the UK this spring from the US. Some Bitcoin users see the UK as a more favourable jurisdiction in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the US government spying on the internet as well as centre of a buoyant “fin-tech” industry.
The Bitcoin Foundation, set up to develop the software that runs the currency and to lobby governments and regulators, is searching for staff and office space in London, according to board executive director Jon Matonis.
Last year HMRC had classed Bitcoin as a voucher, charging VAT on the value of the coin itself. Businesses in the UK had protested against that treatment, saying it would drive customers abroad to countries where no charge was levied. HMRC later withdrew that guidance after meetings over the course of last year.
Other taxes, such as corporation tax, would still apply. The policy applies to all business that buy, sell or exchange Bitcoin.
The total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is $6.9bn, up from $150m a year ago, according to BlockChain.info. The price of Bitcoin stood at $555 on Sunday, according to the BTC-E exchange, down from a peak of $1,242 in December.
The tax authority said: “HMRC has been working closely with the Bitcoin industry on the tax treatment of trading in Bitcoins and commission. We will be issuing guidance shortly.”
Simon Dixon at Bank to the Future, which helps start-ups to raise funding and has 10 working on Bitcoin projects, said: “The Bitcoin start-up community is booming. If we get favourable regulations that will build a lot of interest from start-ups around the world to come and base themselves in London.”

One of the reasons prediction markets were conceived and researched was the realisation that people putting their money where their mouth was had great utility. It has been shown many times that people who risk money make better predictions. He bought 20k BTC because he believed they would appreciate. He was right. If he'd predicted a price increase and didn't buy any, you could dismiss that prediction, it would be a reasonable position to take.

Greece is the obvious first port of call because of the cultural and family ties to Cyprus, but the UK might soon be a very welcome destination for Bitcoin companies, after the recent tax announcements etc. The UK economy is also larger than Greece, and there is the prospect of access to The City.

'Money printing' is a mix of things including injecting liquidity, central banks buying government bonds, acting as buyer of last resort etc, we know all that.
I guess we disagree on whether it has done harm or has made things better (at least no worse). One group that agrees it has made things better are mutually dependent central bankers, governments and TBTFs. That's an interesting observation, in my opinion.

Their model isn't predicated on the price of bitcoin rising. You're referring to one of many services (the pegged EUR account) that would be more profitable given a rising price. The majority of their services would do just fine if the price doesn't rise from here.
If you read the old prospectus and hadn't followed Neo's Bitcointalk thread, you can be forgiven for focusing on the EUR pegged account, but Neo's plans and ambition have been evolving rapidly since it was first published. That's why the announcement of a new prospectus on Monday is a big deal - it will provide details on new lines of business and updated financial forecasts.

PART 2
Propaganda crowded out
But, while the universalisation of propaganda may have provided ever more of us with these awesome propaganda tools, it has also debased its worth. Attention span, after all, is finite. Millions, if not billions, of voices (both private and corporate) now compete against each other to influence public opinion on a daily basis.
Think of it this way. Proctor &amp; Gamble isn’t competing with Pepsico for your attention span anymore, it’s competing with the pictures and videos of cats, food and holidays posted by your nearest and dearest. What’s more, the more corporations try to butt into the private propaganda space, the more we grow to resent them. This is because personal propaganda is far more powerful and engaging than corporate propaganda could ever hope to be.
In that context, the traditional strategy of pandering to our egos — mostly by promoting the ethos that this or that product can make you the person you want to be — simply doesn’t do the trick anymore.
We don’t need unnecessary “aspirational” products to make our ego feel good. We’ve got online tools to propagate and project whatever image of ourselves we want to. We’ve got apps that photoshop our spotty faces. Apps that help us turn home videos into Hollywood quality movies. Apps that allow us to engage in oneupmanship. Apps that help us eat less, not more.
And just like conventional propagandists before us, we have no qualms about doctoring our photos, being liberal with the truth or glossing over reality in a bid to enhance the image it presents to those it’s seeking to influence or coerce.
True, corporate interests are still trying to harness the power of private propaganda for themselves. But — in the new open propaganda war — that means getting people to associate their own narcissistic self-promotion with their products. That’s a big ask, given that time spent promoting products is less time spent promoting yourself, and your online desirability.
In our minds, no product is more important than ourselves. And that’s because the ultimate reward of propaganda, if used wisely, is the sort of hierarchal positioning that was previously only ever associated with dictator-level personality cults.
The best propagandists understand this. They understand that people will only promote a product if it helps them promote themselves at the same time. Yet herein lies a fundamental paradox.
As Caesar and Augustus knew only too well, a personality cult will never successfully penetrate public minds if it is too focused on itself. Conversely it needs to be masterfully disassociated from self promotion, and re-associated with altruistic value, humour, or benevolence. In Caesar and Augustus’ case it was only through publicly rejecting kingly power, that they were able to create a much more powerful empirical office to replace it.
A masterful slight of hand and example of misdirection.
Sophisticated personal propaganda campaigns can be differentiated from unsophisticated ones in exactly this way. The distribution of highly doctored selfies eventually begins to nauseate. No-one likes a narcissist or a megalomaniac. Meanwhile, too much association with high-end products or exclusivity meanwhile backfires with the “Rich Kids of Instagram” effect.
Today’s most effective propaganda consequently is the sort that inspires people to care about things other than themselves. It’s not aspirational as much as experience or ideology based.
Red bull was an early trailblazer on this front, disassociating itself almost entirely from the product in its marketing and focusing on fun, experience and radical individualism. The ads don’t sell the product, they sell a brand, which in reality is a social protocol for a different (more enjoyable) way of life. An ideology focused on experience not consumerism.
Which finally brings us back to Bitcoin.
As we noted before, Bitcoin can’t survive without manufacturing consent for its ideology. In the new open propaganda era that means getting as many people as possible to associate their own self-promotion with Bitcoin, and its success. What we’ve seen in the last few years, consequently, is one of the most sophisticated propaganda strategies ever deployed in this regard.
All the more impressive because it’s been portrayed as being fully grass roots in nature.
Yet, as we’ve already noted, no propaganda campaign can be successful in the long run if it depends too much on narcissistic self-promotion. The trick, consequently, is appealing to the personality cult desires of the masses, but at the same time making them appear somehow altruistic or socially minded.
As an ideology, Bitcoin captures and enlists minds by achieving that balance perfectly.The fundamental message of the movement being that its success empowers you, and with it everyone else.
It is, in short, the sort of propaganda more commonly associated with political indoctrination.
And yet the paradox is that it actually serves the old-fashioned corporate interests of those who understand, as ever, how to exploit the system’s followers to their own ends.
Just like Caesar, Bitcoin publicly rejects concentrated authority as a form of misdirection. It promotes decentralised authority just to disguise the real power grabbing that’s going on below the surface.
The aim is the same as always: forging guaranteed demand for a product nobody needs, but which will bestow profits and power on a concentrated few without you noticing, mostly by appealing to our collective self-centredness. Those few are early adopters, the dominant miners and more recently the corporate interests that were quick enough to figure out that in the new open propaganda era, manufacturing consent for products nobody needs is much harder than propagating an existing Emperor’s Clothes delusion and creating businesses that can profit from it.
The collapse of MT Gox and the insistence by the likes of Andreessen, Horowitz, Winklevoss and Keiser that this doesn’t somehow undermine the system, consequently, speaks volumes about the real power play going on within.
Their spin, of course, is that the collapse of MT Gox was an important learning curve for the Bitcoin community, and one which can empower it. MT Gox got too big too quickly, and was fundamentally corrupt from the outset. Its collapse now makes way for a more prudent, better run and more powerful business. A new era of self regulation.
Caesar’s death similarly did not make way for the reconstitution of the old Republic, but rather opened the door to an emboldened Augustus and the establishment of the extremely long-standing Roman Empire.
That the emperor system was tantamount to kingly tyranny, mattered very little to the Roman people. By that point they were so enamoured and indoctrinated, and so fed up of civil war, they couldn’t care less that the old tyrannical system was being re-created right in front of their eyes. Either that or they bought so wholeheartedly into the myth of a new era, they chose to ignore the obvious signs that it was simply the old system which they had once rejected being reformed.
A similar cognitive dissonance is currently going on within the Bitcoin community, which seems little bothered about the contradictions associated with on the one hand rejecting authority, government and regulation, and on the other hand embracing Bitcoin’s transformation into a system that regulates its wild west elements, defends the hierarchal elite it has established, and in some cases even calls for government protection of the fantasy property rights it itself has created.
In other words, all of a sudden the community has no issue with empowering a central organised authority, favouring an established elite, or subscribing to Too Big Too Fail.
Most people would say you can’t have it both ways. Unfortunately, if you’re a Bitcoin enthusiast it seems you’re immune to such contradictions. And if that says anything at all, it’s that the new type of propaganda is more powerful than we probably appreciated.

Is economist-speak to justify the root rational for helicopter money, which is: make people believe they are wealthier than they are.
If establishment economists would just be honest and admit their objective is to manipulate human behaviour, maybe we could then take the discussion forward, try to reach some kind of consensus on where we are and how we get to a better place. Most people (fans of Krugman, even), would be aghast if he were to admit this openly. As in, "I'm a Nobel winning economist, who, being smarter than you, promotes pseudoscience and propaganda to steer your behaviour". Until we hear this said, this whole debate is futile.

Dynastic analysis is interesting, but I don't see how this is a plausible explanation for why there are so many rich and poor Jews in the world today. And there is also the questions of Eastern European conversions from the Middle Ages etc, so a genetic angle isn't very rational. You may as well turn this theory lose on Catholicism or Quakerism, then wonder why it doesn't quite work. The Pope is rich, my church-going neighbour isn't. So... Jesus did this?!
Jews were robbed and thrown out of their homelands many times through out history, so the 'got in early, invested wisely for the kids' in a South Fork fashion doesn't really work for me. There are many successful Jewish families, true, but there are also many successful gentile ones, so to me, the obvious explanation is to do with IQ, luck and perspiration - and maybe nepotism helps for one generation or so. But friends are fickle, so the crony card rather plays itself out. And, really... dynasty? This isn't fucking ancient Egypt any more. Does anyone here really like the Kennedys, Windsors or Blairs?

Yeah, this is spot on - the disintermediation hasn't started yet, but that is coming in the next 2-3 years. Possibly the finance sector will have down-sized a fair amount by then, so although the BTC impact will still be significant, it might be less dramatic than some currently expect.
As to the 'free-people' argument du jour on this forum, that remains to be seen. At the very least, genuine financial innovation and better consumer-offerings will be forth coming. The banks can no longer sit in the 20th Century and print money, that's for sure.

Eh, I think you are a little mixed-up. The whole point of the EU and the Euro is to wrap European nations in a deadly embrace of central control, managed from Brussels/Strasbourg. This allows the European elite to regulate and nanny these countries and their populations for their 'own good', otherwise they are expected to start WWIII, as stupid peoples do. The PIIGS' problems with the EUR are secondary - they were only allowed to adopt it (despite being unsuited) because it aided control from the centre.

It's worth mentioning that 'consumers' are intended to be the bulk of the population who, after tax, spend the majority of their income on goods and services provided by extremely wealthy rent seekers. People who collateralise their assets in order to create these income streams or buy up sovereign debt to be repaid at interest by future taxes. Consumer regulation and the annual debasing of our currencies is for the benefit of this minority, which is pretty ironic because the author probably believes himself to be the antithesis of the rentiers, when he is actually a facilitator.

I've thought for a while the two companies that can accelerate bitcoin adoption with the public are Netflix and Airbnb.
Netflix because it would display bitcoin on a TV screen, legitimising it with your average couch potato.
Airbnb because it would make it desirable among the back packing/independent traveller crowd.

Satellites and PCs were invented by the government? I don't think so.
The internet was certainly developed by the US government, but like others have said here, if they hadn't done it, someone else would have and it would probably have been better from the start.
You do know the US government wastes billions on computer cryptography? And when they do make breakthroughs, they are put to use to subvert democracy and spy on citizens. They don't tend to share this knowledge, leaving individuals and the private sector to independently develop their own solutions. I can't think of a less optimal use of tax payer funds.

PART 1
The Bitcoin personality cult lives on
Izabella Kaminska	 | Feb 27 16:02
Part of the BITCOINMANIA SERIES
How to handle bad news, by public relations guru and propaganda expert Edward Bernays from his book Propaganda (1928):
The counsel on public relations must be in a position to deal effectively with rumours and suspicions, attempting to stop them at their source, counteracting them promptly with correct or more complete information through channels which will be most effective, or best of all establish such relationships of confidence in the concern’s integrity that rumours and suspicions will have no opportunity to take root.
A single factory, potentially capable of supplying a whole continent with its particular product, cannot afford to wait until the public asks for its product; it must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda, with the vast public in order to assure itself the continuous demand which alone will make its costly plant profitable.
Keep that in mind, as we attempt to rationalise the response to recent news that Bitcoin exchange MT Gox has collapsed, accompanied by reassurances from the community’s biggest names that none of this impacts the potential of Bitcoin itself.
For it was Edward Bernays who first observed decades ago that mass production had changed the marketplace so fundamentally that companies would forever be reliant on propaganda to create demand where there was none. He termed this process “manufacturing consent”.
Bitcoin’s power, for obvious reasons, relies more than most on this process. Without mass manufactured consent, Bitcoin is nothing.
Bernays didn’t see any of this as sinister, mind you. In a free market, he argued, propaganda was simply a tool for competitive big business, whose goal was always to get bigger, more powerful and more monopolistic. If one particular company or faction’s propaganda came to dominate too much, there shouldn’t be anything stopping another from offsetting or countering that propaganda with their own propaganda.
Modern democratic capitalistic society, in other words, was geared towards propaganda wars. A constant battle over hearts and minds, so much so that — for the most part — we have become completely oblivious to the conditioning we are exposed to.
Up for grabs (for the most effective practitioners, at least) are the trappings of guaranteed demand, profit and power.
It isn’t entirely Wild West, mind you. Some degree of regulatory oversight exists. Though, of course, it’s focused mostly on differentiating fact from fiction, or prohibiting propaganda that encourages self-destructive behaviours or products (such as tobacco), a consensus itself ironically achieved via offsetting propaganda efforts — lobbying and campaigning — of more ethically or socially minded groups. Nevertheless, none of this stops expert practitioners from exploiting society’s base desires, lusts and wants to serve their needs irrespective of the ethics.
Hence why it’s still acceptable to indoctrinate children with detergent adverts in between cartoons. Having kids pester their parents to buy this or that isn’t seen as exploitative, it’s seen as clever marketing.
But what Bernays also noted was that propaganda was most effective when it focused on validating or furthering the causes of particular social groups. i.e. when it helped to align the interests of business with politics.
Back when Bernays was writing, of course, the gateway to manipulating public opinion was restricted to a small group of PR practitioners and propagandists due to the costs associated with gaining access to mass market media.
Today, however, the internet — and social media in particular — has changed that completely. The propaganda industry has been disrupted to the same degree by social media as conventional business was disrupted by mass production processes so many years ago.
Anyone with a Twitter account has the means to become a successful propagandist.
The greatest shift is that most propaganda is no longer dominated by corporate interests striving to command our hearts and minds so that they can sell us more products. Propaganda is instead being used by us to sell ourselves to our peers.
Whereas old style corporate messages pandered to our ego by convincing us that this or that product can make us project a better version of ourselves, today we can jump over that entire process thanks to the many direct outlets for heavily manipulated self projection.

I think there will be a welcome roll-out of strong encryption tools to consumers in the next couple of years, and people will start to take privacy seriously. So there is some hope there.
Probably, if consumer-focused systems are locked down because PKI takes off, various agencies will stop targeting forums/chat rooms. They'll simply redirect the old budgets to boost psyops/case work. So, they aren't going away, unfortunately.

To be a 'fan' of a theory is kind of strange, don't you think? You can agree, disagree or be undecided/indifferent, but you have to admit the Austrian School is either right to wrong, or has some things right.
And if the Austrians are 100% right, does you being a non-fan serve any useful purpose? Because if they are right, it would suggest bitcoin is going to be a spectacular success as it will perfectly compliment the reality of the economy, long misunderstood by Keynesians.

As far as the HMRC are concerned, exchanging foreign currency for goods/services will realise a gain if the currency has appreciated against GBP.
In the example of a holiday to Australia, you may have bought £50k of AUD, and since it is possible for AUD to appreciate ~20% before you reach Australia, you will exceed your annual CGT threshold when you spend them all. Since the purpose of your AUD purchase was for a holiday, not speculation, they will waive CGT.

A dangerous mistake lies at Bitcoin’s intellectual core
By Mark Williams
We need the flexible and timely policy that cryptocurrencies rule out, says Mark Williams
This weekend Russia became the latest country to crack down on Bitcoin. China has already banned its citizens from buying the “cryptocurrency”, which functions like cash in that it can be transferred anonymously from one person to another without the involvement of a central clearing house. Western regulators are also watching nervously.
The role that Bitcoin can play in facilitating illicit trade has so far attracted most comment. Silk Road, a secret website where contraband was bought and sold, showed that a virtual currency can be more useful to a drug dealer than cash, which must be carried, or bank transfers that leave an electronic trail.
Real though these concerns are, they miss the far more serious threat from the economic ideas behind Bitcoin. An individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first described the workings of the virtual currency in 2008. The following year they released the first version of the software that issues Bitcoins and keeps track of when they are spent. By then, many had come to doubt whether dollars, euros and other government-issued currencies would hold their worth – and whether orthodox monetary institutions were the best way to promote prosperity. Bitcoin has gained a following partly because it seems to show us how we can do without money issued by the state. Currency could be nationless.
Keeping money stable and trustworthy has traditionally been a function of national governments. By controlling the money supply and targeting interest rates, the authorities try to promote job creation and economic growth, while preventing runaway inflation that would cause the system of market exchange to break down. Calibrating monetary policy to the needs of the economy is an enormous undertaking. Central banks such as the US Federal Reserve employ hundreds of people to analyse economic data, chart the best path for monetary policy and explain their decisions to the public.
Bitcoin is designed to take these jobs away from central bankers and give it to a simple algorithm instead. Since an autonomous computer system cannot react to complex data such as the unemployment rate or the level of output, Bitcoin uses a fixed formula to control the currency supply. New tokens will be minted at a predetermined rate until a ceiling is reached some time around 2140, after which supply of the currency will stop growing.
Nakamoto’s writings seem to indicate that the motivation, at least in part, was the libertarian ideal of putting money creation beyond the reach of meddling central bankers. But this is a mistake. It ignores the ebbs and flow of economic cycles – a reckless approach that is the equivalent of a doctor giving penicillin to every patient without first checking whether they are suffering from infection, depression or mania.
Some newer competitors to Bitcoin try to correct this, allowing the supply of the currency to grow indefinitely in an attempt to generate low but positive inflation. Others incorporate penalties for hoarding, which are intended to ensure that the tokens circulate more freely. While these are a marked improvement over Bitcoin, they all share the same flaw. The state of the economy does not depend solely on the pace of money creation but also on patterns of human behaviour that are too complex to capture in a simple rule.
That is why we need central bankers who can adjust monetary policy to promote prosperity when people behave in unexpected ways. True, the experts in charge of monetary policy in the years before 2008 failed to prevent the financial crisis. But their decisive action in its aftermath is widely credited with preventing a depression. Without a massive expansion in the money supply, many countries may now be dealing with serious deflation. Yet it is precisely this kind of flexible and timely policy reaction that cryptocurrencies aim to rule out.
The software behind Bitcoin is a remarkable technical achievement but those who tout such systems as a way of saving capitalism are profoundly wrong. Governments should be wary of allowing any virtual currency, unless they first find a way of putting central bankers back in charge.

No, if you own these assets you have nothing to fear. Further, anyone who works hard for a living or runs a successful business can thrive in a low-deflation environment and continue to borrow to buy a house etc. However, if you are extremely wealthy with multiple high value assets and collateralise them to bring in a steady cash-flow, further enriching yourself (something the poor and middle class cannot do), then you hate deflation.  The unproductive rich and rent seekers generally hate it. It's their grubby secret.

I suppose it's only fair to point out that the Bitcoin infrastructure is under developed in every way - Neo themselves are a conscious part of the effort to fix this.

You got that right.
However, like a sick and curious dog or a man with an itchy scab on the elbow, I can't help coming back to this banking shtick...
Thinking about it the last few hours, I have concluded the whole Jewish thing is ridiculous (mostly). Banking (in its very recent form, say 300 years) was created by Scots, inspired by the Venetian model, and has plenty to do with the Masons, Illuminati (of the 1776 kind) and British Royalty. Is it possible the conspiracy theories work to deflect from this obvious fact? Child, how do you hide a conspiracy? You construct a better one!
Anyhow, before I fall asleep to the tune of the the bleedin' obvious, it is worth while pointing out that although ~~spammers~~posters here claim otherwise, a reputable journals says:
Interesting, eh?

I thought he did ok as well. You have to place his answers in context of the general hostility CNBC have shown toward bitcoin since the Mt Gox fiasco. They sure lol'd at that one, wrote off bitcoin just as they had always wanted to. Buffet's warning to stay away from it was icing on the cake to them.
We all know bitcoin isn't going away, so CNBC will have to edge themselves back in to the acceptance camp without looking foolish. If bitcoin proponents and CEOs they interview in the coming weeks play it safe, don't try to say 'told you so' or point out how pathetic their tech understanding is, this will help them shift ground.

They can make bad choices, and continue to do so for decades without concern for the self-correcting mechanism of the market.

"Helicopter money" is just a turn of phrase that Krugman and Bernanke are comfortable with, neither they or I consider it 'propaganda'. They are quite comfortable joking about this subject in public, so there's nothing contentious here.
I'm really puzzled why you disagree that its purpose is to make people feel wealthier. People spend money on goods/services they desire or require when they believe they can afford them. Printing money and giving it to them is a guaranteed way to make most 'feel wealthier', whether they live hand in mouth on the breadline or own a stock portfolio worth a million more than this time last year. Again this is just a turn of phrase and its use isn't considered controversial by economists.

I'm not going to enumerate the &gt;100 counter-arguments to your Apple is Evil take. Obviously :)
On the second point, I would say Gates is the bigger fake and being mostly aspie is unable to connect with real people, so intrinsically has no appreciation of kicking-the-dirt value. I would say Jobs was the better human being because unlike his nemesis, he had an incredible focus on the narrow slit of opportunity he stumbled into to create vast wealth, mostly for the betterment of humanity. Jobs didn't contribute to charity? I LOL at that one. Repeatedly.
To take it from the macro to micro, I have no any plans to donate to charity until I walk with the aid of a Zimmer frame. The reason? I can create more wealth for TPOPE (the people of planet Earth), via my industrious nature, than a lazy charity can. Does this make me an unlikeable persons i.e. a Jobs rather than a Gates? I don't care.

1. Apple created DTP?
2. Apple kick started OO coding?
The list is long, so there's no point in disputing 1 &amp; 2.
Gates never fulfilled the potential he and MS promised. In actuality, they did a lot of harm. They would have crushed Apple, OSS and free platforms if they could have. They convinced governments around the world teaching MS Office to children was equivalent to teaching them coding simply to sell more licenses. That's pretty evil in my book - limiting a child's prospects to enrich Gates and his cronies.

Bitcoin may be many things: a cheaper and more efficient payments mechanism, a decentralised form of QE, an extreme way to break through the ZLB, a worthy private substitute for cash, an opportunity to stick it to the man or even a speculative investment opportunity of a lifetime.
What it isn’t, however, is a fair distribution of income.
Steven Englander at Citi comes to a similar conclusion, despite previously appearing a tad more enthusiastic about the idea of a private currency gaining traction.
As he noted on Monday:
"With Bitcoin again over USD1000 on reports over the weekend of interest in Bitcoin by US hedge funds, real estate firms and online gamers, it seems churlish to be skeptical on how Bitcoin will evolve. Nonetheless, we are less excited about Bitcoin as a store of value and alternative to fiat currencies than about its potential use in facilitating transaction and improving payments efficiency. We also argue that seignorage gains on either Bitcoin or its clones lead both to fiscal losses for governments and very unstable price dynamics, Net, net, we like small-‘b’ generic bitcoin as a payments technology more than big-‘B’ brand-name Bitcoin as a store of value."
A fair observation, we think.
After all, no one can question the truly innovative aspects of Bitcoin on the payments side. As Felix Salmon notes, any advances are more than welcome, because the current state of the industry is dire — incumbents have a monopoly and very little interest in overhauling failing and decaying networks to make anything more efficient or cheaper. Central banks can drop hints and cough loudly to try to encourage the industry to move in the right direction, but since it’s a private market, they can’t enforce anything at all.
In Salmon’s mind, however, the solution is unlikely to lie in new stores of value, or further fragmentation of the currency or payments system. What we want is ubiquity.
Which is why we think the best thing that could happen would be if the central bank borrowed from the lessons of Bitcoin and allowed its official money to be distributed digitally in a similar way. The only difference would be that supply would be mined and controlled by the central bank, not network miners.
We’ll have more on that in an upcoming post drawing on a conversation we had with Miles Kimball.
But it’s worth revisiting one of the key problems with the Bitcoin system as it stands: the fact that seigniorage revenue currently flows to a very concentrated pool of individuals. Worse still, that a lot of these individuals have no interest in printing for wider distribution. Their aim ultimately is to enhance seigniorage revenue with outright appreciation meaning that they, unlike central banks, are also speculators, motivated to “print” coins as much for hoarding purposes as for seigniorage returns.
As Englander notes:
"Best estimates are that there are about one million holders of Bitcoin; 47 individuals hold about 30 percent, another 900 hold a further 20 percent, the next 10,000 about 25% and another million about 20%, with 5% being lost. So 1/10th of one percent represent about half the holdings of Bitcoin and 1 percent close to 80 percent. The concentration of Litecoin ownership is similar.
Most of the big wallets have been in place from early on, so sitting back and watching your capital grow has been a very successful strategy. The distribution of Bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea and makes China’s and even the US’ wealth distribution look like that of a workers’ paradise. There are estimates of a Gini coefficient of 0.88 for Bitcoin, but if anything the estimates are low if big holders own multiple wallets and the overall concentration of Bitcoin wealth is greater than in the sample used to estimate the coefficients . The most recent estimate of Gini coefficients of wealth concentration does not show any country above 0.85 , but this sample did not include North Korea."
And as Englander also observes:
"Seignorage generates strong incentives for holders of the original Bitcoin to encourage its use, but it also generates incentives to create many alternative currencies, and mine them early and often. The hope is that one or several of these currencies will either a) take hold as a store of value or b) become so fashionable that the early miners can cash out. One element of the tulip bubble that is always ignored is that it was a boon to tulip farmers in addition to speculators. Given how specialized mining has become, the seignorage gains to Bitcoin follow-ons will accrue heavily to a narrow swatch of tulip farmers technology mavens who are in a position to mine each successive alternative currency while the going is good and cheap.
Fiat currency seignorage allows governments to spend more than their revenue raising capacity would permit. Citi’s Willem Buiter argues for ‘four different but related concepts, each of which highlights some aspect of the way in which the state acquires command over real resources through its ability to issue fiat money’ . If the seignorage accrues to early adopters of Bitcoin or its lookalikes, less will accrue to the government."
No surprise then that so-called “Bitcoin experts” tend to be extremely dismissive of alternative crypto currency systems in the market.
God forbid others get the chance to benefit disproportionately as early entrants in an asset-less scheme that has the capacity to exploit the internet’s capacity for viral memes and fads.
We thought the following quote from Johnathan Turrall, chief technology officer at Metalair, a cryptocurrency start-up based at the University of Sussex, about plans to introduce an altcoin themed around Kanye West kind of said it all in terms of irony.
From the BBC:
"However, one Bitcoin expert urged caution in investing in new virtual currencies that were as yet untested in public use. “There’s been a number of people who have put out ‘joke’ currencies in the past,” said Johnathan Turrall, chief technology officer at Metalair, a cryptocurrency start-up based at the University of Sussex. “There were some coins in the past that seemed to be a ‘pump and dump’ operation.
“In one case, the original developers launched on obscure websites, but when they took it mainstream, and the price spiked, they sold up and disappeared. Estimated earnings in one instance were $800,000.” "
Yup. In the free-market world of crypto currencies all private alternatives to fiat are theoretically equal, but some are more equal than others. Meaning in the eyes of the Bitcoin community it’s okay for some people to be able to mint themselves free money and encourage its acceptance for real-world goods, but it’s not okay for everyone to be able to do the same — in line with competitive free market principles.
The irony that Bitcoin must become as totalitarian as fiat currency if it’s to survive, is apparently lost on Bitcoin’s freedom-loving community.
Luckily, the free-market spirit of the internet provides. Indeed, following in the footsteps of dogecoin’s success — a comedy coin — the internet has finally figured out that epic altcoin proliferation is best handled the same way epic cat video proliferation was handled. Via the creation of ever more successful and viral memes!
In fact, on coingen.io anyone with a good enough coin-themed meme can have a go at trying to make it the next big thing (H/T Justin Cormack) .
It’s an important development! Not least because it exposes the fundamental nature of the altcoin movement: it’s all a giant internet-based popularity contest, wherein those who amuse others successfully are rewarded with clicks or high velocity transfers not dissimilar to any other contagious meme.
Of course, it’s not entirely insane that internet memes and money should have ended up being fused in this way. Money has viral qualities of its own, while memes — born of a velocity effect — remain a store of value for as long as the crowd stays enticed by the concept.
We’d suggest that in an abundant age where wealth distribution according to old values based on rewarding those who create more material stuff only hurts the system by creating supply shocks or resource squeezes, there’s even some sense in rewarding those who have the power to capture anyone’s imagination.
But if we are going to make money and finance into a farce, it would be nice if we could at least do it in a way that allocates wealth to more deserving causes than Bitcoin miners. For example, initiatives like Plastic Bank, which is attempting to turn discarded plastic into a currency in an effort to incentivise people to clean up and ideally distribute a little wealth to the world’s most impoverished, seem like a much better idea.
Alternatively, why not start a currency based on good deeds, wherein supply is controlled by the number of public approvals needed for the deed in question?
In any case, here’s a meme-based coin idea of our own: Hitcoin

No, they are not. You shouldn't confuse the transactional history of bitcoin as it is spent and received by users with the modern fiat practice of credits and debits against user accounts. When a bitcoin is mined into existence, it does not have a debit and cancelling credit associated with it, unlike fiat money created by a central bank. A bitcoin exists full stop, and is owned by the person or entity that controls the wallet, it cannot be cancelled out of existence, again unlike fiat money.

Let's take the biggie: Seigniorage. At the moment the primary dealers and other financial institutions close to the central banks are getting free money. By the time it makes its way to the man in the street (typically it doesn't), the advantage has been taken and he is left to buy ever more expensive food and services. This scam of the ages stops with Bitcoin since the miners produce new coins via proof of work, not proof of Daddy's connections.

The tiny Channel Island of Alderney is launching an audacious bid to become the first jurisdiction to mint physical Bitcoins, amid a global race to capitalise on the booming virtual currency.
The three-mile long British crown dependency has been working on plans to issue physical Bitcoins in partnership with the UK’s Royal Mint since the summer, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.
It wants to launch itself as the first international centre for Bitcoin transactions by setting up a cluster of services that are compliant with anti-money laundering rules, including exchanges, payment services and a Bitcoin storage vault.
The special Bitcoin would be part of the Royal Mint’s commemorative collection, which includes limited edition coins and stamps that are normally bought by collectors. It would have a gold content – a figure of £500-worth has been proposed – so that holders could conceivably melt and sell the metal if the exchange value of the currency were to collapse.
The hype surrounding Bitcoin has escalated in recent months and its market value has rocketed; the price of a single Bitcoin hit a new peak of $1,242 on Friday on the Mt Gox exchange, established in Tokyo in 2009 as a trading card exchange.
Critics warn of a speculative bubble although its proponents believe that the currency could be widely adopted as a method of making payments outside the traditional banking system. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other government officials around the world have said virtual currencies could have benefits if they can be regulated to prevent money laundering.
Holders of the Alderney Bitcoin would not be able to spend it in stores but would be able to exchange it for a virtual Bitcoin by travelling to the island.
Alderney hopes that by minting the first physical Bitcoin it will raise its profile as the “go-to” destination for the virtual currency, as it seeks to expand its offshore credentials beyond the online gambling sector.
David Janczewski, head of new business at the Royal Mint confirmed it had been approached by the finance minister of Alderney to “explore the possibility of manufacturing a physical commemorative coin with a Bitcoin theme”.
“Discussions have not progressed further and at this stage it remains nothing more than a concept,” he added.
But the controversy around Bitcoin has made the Alderney plan a sensitive subject. The Treasury, which owns the Royal Mint, declined to comment on the plans. George Osborne, the British chancellor, also holds the title of Master of the Mint.
The plans have been steered by chairman of the island’s finance committee, and are understood to have the support of Alderney’s president, although they still need to be approved by the island’s 10-member parliament.
A number of private companies have produced physical Bitcoins, although they are not backed by an official mint. Instead they feature a holographic strip, which is peeled off to reveal the private key then redeemed online.
How would Alderney’s plan work?
An independent company will provide the Bitcoins. If the price plunged, neither Alderney nor the Royal Mint would lose anything.
The company would put the Bitcoins in an escrow account at an agreed price.
Meanwhile, the Royal Mint would take customers’ orders for its minted Bitcoins and receive money from those coin sales.
The virtual Bitcoins backing the physical coins would be held in digital storage facilities by Alderney.
The Mint would issue the commemorative Bitcoin, paying for the value of the gold content itself. Alderney would receive royalties from sales of the coins.
Coins could be redeemed for sterling at any point in Alderney for the price of a Bitcoin on that day.

That's ok. Lots of people do see the relevance of posts like these which is one of the reasons they are working on Bitcoin start-ups right now. If you want to be an early bird and catch the worm, it helps to be born with wings.

"I think economics is a science"
Eh, I can falsify that statement before breakfast. Care to present your argument otherwise?

Technology is generally amoral and it has no mind of its own - we can place Bitcoin and assault rifles in that bucket without too much controversy. To assume someone buys an AR-15 lower for nothing other than evil intention is so intellectually lazy it makes me shudder.

There is also an interesting Editorial discussing Bitcoin:
*Banking on Bitcoin - Virtual currencies could rival banknotes, but not bankers*
If a small city state had adopted Bitcoin as its national currency, it would now be in the grip of deflation as foreign speculators siphoned away its supply of the virtual currency. Money would be scarce, and prices would fall dramatically. Authorities might try to lift prices but they would lack one of their most powerful tools. Central bankers can create money at will, by printing notes or creating deposits. Bitcoin is based on digital tokens, which are generated at an unalterable rate by cryptographic algorithms running on the computers of volunteers, making it impossible to match supply to demand.
This is an improbable fantasy. But Bitcoin’s undulating value makes it unsuitable for all but the most limited purposes. Speculators are the keenest acquirers of the currency. For some, it is a way of stashing wealth where authorities cannot find it. Others want to make purchases without leaving an obvious trace. Silk Road, the online contraband emporium that was closed by authorities last month, was one of the few businesses to insist on payment in Bitcoin. But many prices were pegged to the dollar; the virtual money served merely as a way of disguising the flow of hard currency.
Still, if Bitcoin’s applications are limited, its emergence as a workable means of exchange nonetheless reveals something surprising. Friedrich Hayek argued that the government should cede its monopoly over the money supply, leaving consumers free to choose between competing currencies. It turns out that they were already freer than they thought. Authorities have so far tolerated the virtual currency. Yet the product of the state-owned incumbent has proved more attractive than Hayek expected.
The experiment is an indication of how monetary systems might change in future. Many believed it impossible to create a form of electronic cash that did not rely on a bank to keep tabs on account balances. Bitcoin proved them wrong. But many are uneasy about reversing the technological accident that has made financial transactions more traceable in the era of electronic banking.
Some see tamper-proof virtual currencies as preferable to physical ones that central bankers can easily debase. The island of Alderney is in talks with Royal Mint to make physical coins backed by Bitcoins in its electronic vault. But enthusiasts should be careful what they wish for. An unstable price level is dangerous. Removing the steering-wheel is the wrong way to prevent central bankers from driving the economy off the road.

Correct. They are also mostly useless in the broad economics domain. However, they look very impressive to the layman which is why they are so prevalent in economics 'text books'.
Seriously, there are less than 90 years left in this century - the one we will live and die in, so do something spectacular with your life. Don't waste it on pseudoscience.

The way I see it, we used to have a world where finance and tech groups had clear demarcation lines. Economics and money was left to the finance guys, while the IT guys built the platforms that finance asked for while working on other areas of interest in their spare time. Now it appears the tech guys have turned their attention to how money works only to discover they have the skills and know-how to reinvent it.
The problem the finance guys have, going forward, is they will struggle to adapt to this new world. They do not have the technical grounding to appreciate what is happening here - many of them lacking an understanding of the network effect being just one relatively trivial example of how far they are out of their depth. Au contraire, the tech guys have embraced Bitcoin because they see the potential to re-invent the modern world into something better. They see a future world that makes more sense, is more equitable and banshies financial voodoo to history.

You are correct, in that some Founding Fathers believed in rights given by God. But it really was a figure of speech to some - but not all - of them. And they didn't necessarily agree on what 'God' was.

If Bitcoin is "3 things: (1) a protocol, (2) a commodity, and (3) an ecosystem", I propose we start using the terms: pBitcoin, cBitcoin and eBitcoin to differentiate the three. After all, Satoshi himself could have given the components very different names. Possibly, in hindsight, he wishes he had.

"Journalists and other commentators aren't surprised when their challenge to conventional wisdom elicits a strong pushback from fanatics"
LOL. Talk about the mainstream media jumping the shark. When the journalist typed that sentence, he was probably deadly serious. You know, smoking a pipe with a furled brow.

They *are* working on it.

Wait until they accept Bitcoin is much more than a store of value and a smarter way to buy goods online. When they recognise it is a protocol on which a new financial system can be built, they will easily come around to x10 this valuation. Probably some time in 2014.
As it stands, their price of $1300 is significant to the binary outcome theory many hold. It BoA have concluded Bitcoin has a non-zero value, it reinforces the view that one day it will be in the $100k - $1 million range.

The problem with 'credits', although the name would be cool, is it implies credits and debits applied to a bank's ledger, i.e. we are back to fiat money. One of the main benefits of bitcoin the currency is zero counter-party risk. When you own a bitcoin, it really is yours, it isn't a ledger entry in a database where you are in credit and someone else, like a central bank, is in debit. No counter-party can fail, taking your bitcoin with them. Obviously Bitcoin the protocol could fail, but I think it is becoming apparent the chance of this is growing smaller by the day.

Yes, and I believe Keynesians concluded years ago they had won the argument mainly because they were the ones ingratiated with government, which meant they could present their view as the only legitimate one. It would be mildly entertainining if it hadn’t been such a disaster for the most part.

I don't have a problem with the twins - they had the foresight to invest early on, so I guess they are smart cookies. Who doesn't want smart?
Now, if we zoom out and ponder broad strokes, the old guard that hasn't loaded up on cheap BTC clearly has no place in our future.
