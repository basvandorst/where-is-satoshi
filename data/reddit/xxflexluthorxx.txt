As a noob, where is the best place I should buy Bitcoin?  I started on Coinbase a couple of weeks ago, but the limit is crazy and the fees are really too much.  
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:13:21
yeah, it was pretty much luck.  I saw it dip this morning and decided to sell because I didn't think there would be any momentum to go higher.   We had the crazy dip and I bought in near the bottom because I really dont think bitmain wants to let it go below 6k.  Then the crazy ride up.

Oh what the fuck.  Alex is a fruit cake but he doesn't promote hate.  
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:27:55
Lol. My win was strictly from luck.  
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:10:27
I agree, but it seems like no one has even researched the guy.   Yeah, he promotes crazy conspiracy theories but he doesn't promote hate or whatever these companies are saying he does.  Even if he did, cutting off his finances is pretty bad. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:35:48
i dunno wtf is going on.  Someone hold me.  
At least I sold this morning, bought at the bottom and sold at the top of this weird bounce. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:49:49
Fuck no.  I want cheap coins.  
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:51:25
Vegeta memes when?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:49:25
lol, you people are here every single time the market crashes.  3 weeks later we are in the 9's, everyone has forgotten your silliness and all the other idiots are proclaiming we are going to 100k.  
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:00:56
Lol some shorts getting fuuuuuuuuucked right now 
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:50:12
The only problem with square cash is that they charge significantly over market value for the bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:12:31
ITS NOT REAL SOCIALISM.  4 REALS GUYZ THIS TIME ITLL WORK.  LETS JUST TRY IT ONE MORE TIME XOXO
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:55:47
You are going to feel like an idiot in a month when it’s back up. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:11:07
I guess you are too stupid to know what their main export is. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:38:41
Gdax has no fees for limit orders 
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:13:51
Which party are they run by?  Oh right, the Democrats, who lean far more to the socialist left than the republicans do. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:14:52
I don’t see how.  I have limit orders set for + and minus 7%ish.  Buy on dip, sell on spike. After spikes there were s always a slight correction to buy back in at and increase your hodl 
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:21:23
I mostly had faster access to the bitcoin I  bought.  That said, I only use Coinbase pro now.  It’s been nearly 8 months since I transferred my bitcoin from cash to coinbase pro.  
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:57:44
It does.  I dont know why people post about things they dont know. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:41:43
Well, that’s nothing we have to worry about this year ����
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:02:43
Do you think it’s going to go down further?  If so sell. You can rebuy more at a lower price.  If you don’t think it’s going to go down then hold it or buy more. There is no reason to hodl in a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:26:56
Did you just assume my gender in Current Year?
@_date: 2019-01-06 05:29:00


That is absolutely not true.  You are just reading off far left talking points. Actually to the the site.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:20:27
Coming from the people that think a nazi pug is a hate crime. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:41:04
Jack is a huge pile of shit though. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:47:51
Yeah, reading this it seems like all these people live in NYC or LA and think everything outside of their bubble is some mad max wasteland.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:48:14
lol at you people living in places where 200k won't get you something relatively decent. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:35:57
lol at the leftist talking down about people in lower income brackets.  Classic!
@_date: 2019-01-06 05:32:50
Yep, it's clown world now.  The left are the ones in favor of giving colluding multinational corporations all the power.   LOL, shit I've seen the left all bent out of shape about Trump leaving Syria and our other dozen wars in the Middle East.  It's nuts. They have no real beliefs.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:33:11
12% drop here!  Whooo!  
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:59:58
And yet I can find similar examples of the same thing on reddit, Twitter, etc. it’s a free speech platform.  You are sure to see things you don’t agree with there.  Debate them or ignore it. if you don’t like it.

letting in massive amount of immigrants, both legal and illegal though chain migration practices and turning a blind eye too.  All the population growth since the 70s has been though immigration.  Housing would probably be much cheaper without it. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:54:31
I'm cool with it.  I'm in the 21 million club now, but I want to be in the 10.5 million club or even 7 million club.   It staying low and swinging a bunch helps me do that!
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:25:29
It also helps US businesses because there is less competition from foreign goods.  It's not cut and dried.  It has benefits and negatives.  Neither outweigh the other.  There is a reason some countries try to devalue their currency 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:25:42
Just wait for the next futures contract to expire.  Then buy your cheap BTC
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:37:34
The fuck did gen x do?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:12:07
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:55:39
What if you sell, then buy more again with your profits at a lower price ;-)
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:21:13
I dunno if the stock market is in a bubble, but I really do believe that a lot of tech firms are grossly over valued.  Facebook and netflix being the two largest.  The shit is really going to hit the fan for facebook if it becomes common knowledge that a large chunk of their userbase isn't real and that there is fuckery with their ad rates and ad serving.  
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:30:46
Well... a weaker dollar means it's easier to other companies to buy things from us, thus helping our exports.  Strong currency isn't always the greatest.  That's why China artificially devalues their currency
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:24:45
It totally could be.  Shorts do get liquidated all the time.  Maybe a lot of them thought it would bounce off of 6800 and go down.  It didn't and they got fucked.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:34:47
You are absolutely retarded. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:50:22
This time socialism will totally work guys!  It just hasn’t been done right!
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:30:32
You are so stupid.  Did you even look at the stock split or dividends?  
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:09:46
Every time up is slower?  Are you high?  Look back at Bitcoin past the  middle of 2017
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:04:41
Capitalism has raised more people out of poverty than any other system despite any flaws it has 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:42:00
And yet it’s up over last year ....
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:15:17
Hopefully.  I don't want to buy above 7k
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:24:08
That's dumb.
