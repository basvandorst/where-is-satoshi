Still 100K. They told me that each transfer has to be 100k. So for example, you can't send 100k one day, then a smaller amount subsequently (e.g 20k top-up). So, I started using Kraken as they let you transfer any amount up to 25k a day (for level 3 verified). Note their site has become almost unusable recently with all the demand!

It must have changed. Here's what I got from support when I requested a $10k transfer:
"Thank you for requesting a wire transfer to Purchase coins. Please make sure you have thoroughly read the following article on the wire transfer process:  Note that the we no longer accept wires less than $100,000."

hey - got confirmation (rudely I might add) from Bittrex today that the min transfer is $100k. You can't deposit funds and buy Bitcoin etc. They convert USD to USDT at a 1:1 rate (if their help page on that is to be believed). Thought this might be useful for others to know. I suspect this will change again, as they seem to be evolving the offering, but that's the status quo.

OK, with the minimum question cleared up, should I be concerned about trading in USDT? I read a number of articles that there concerns with Tether, but these date from Apr/May. At that time, it seemed to lose value against the $, but now seems to be very close to 1:1
I'm a total newb, so I hope these aren't dumb questions.
I just want to buy bitcoin, and it's been a difficult journey so far (Coinbase still can't verify my credit card after 1 week, and 2 attempts). Any advice welcome. Thanks!
