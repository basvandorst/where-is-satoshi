Many here do not even have that.  They all think they are going to buy a Lamborghini in 6 months.
This is why we have the President we do.  Lot's of dumb motherfuckers floating around.
is a cesspool of stupid.

You are another "genius" here who should be banned.
People like you are the reason individuals like Andreas never post here anymore.
Yes, I am brighter than you.
Pro tip:  Everything I have said under my other accounts has come to pass-including manipulation investigation.
I would fucking kick you in the nuts if I met you in person because I do not care for your attitude and ignorance.
This account is now burned.  Later loser.

Huh?  Of course.  What does that have to do with anything?  
The article said 1 WHOLE BTC would need to equal 213k, etc.  It's dumb and wrong.

Well, I used to monitor global operations of a Fortune 500 company for 10 years...  So, there's that.
I quit as a result of "getting lucky."  Anything else, genius?
That you have failed at life is not my problem.  What's annoying to me is that you attempt to project  what you do on when you are clueless and late to the game.

Someone is really trying to suppress things and keep it at a certain level.

Buying lottery tickets is dumb - full stop.  It is a tax on the poor. 
I'd wager dude has 2 BTC or less.  That ain't shit.

How does this figure make even the slightest sense?
There are approximately 36 million millionaires on the planet out of over 7 billion people and currently less than 17 million bitcoin in circulation (less that that due to lost coins, etc).  
I'd wager a good majority of those ~36 million have 200k cash on hand in addition to other assets.
This article and UBS is just being dumb.

If needed, in the future, changes can be made to increase the divisibility beyond 100 million Satoshis per BTC.

Dude, I've been here since 2013 before you ever heard of bitcoin.
I regularly change my usernames.  I've retired off bitcoin and drive a BMW M4 Competition.
Lambos are not practical.
Shut the fuck up.

No, they are not.
Market Cap does not mean X amount of money has been invested in crypto and can be pulled out.
The same can be said for the net worth of the 2 individuals I mentioned.
Ultimately, it's the same fucking thing.
Stop trying to pretend you are some sort of guru.  You're not.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:56:32
Market Cap was in quotes, genius.
Net worth and market cap are similar in this context.
Are you and "Delfinguy" buddies?  You are equally annoying!
