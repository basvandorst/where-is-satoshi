I was polite and reasonable with their support, but that should never be a reason to close my account; unless they want to sweep my complain under the carpet.
The fact that Coinbase was fully aware of this security issue but still didn't do anything about it is mind boggling. Clearly, numerous people warned Coinbase about this issue few months ago, Coinbase was "highly dismissive and assured their security was top notch.":

Futhermore, secure exchanges shouldn't allow random browser extensions to change content on their websites. Secure exchanges go a step further and show the Bitcoin address as an image instead of a text that can be changed by browser extensions.
And, why did they close my account? Sweeping my complain under the carpet won't make this issue disappear.
