@_date: 2016-06-19 03:42:48
Mind exploded trying to comprehend that
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:36:21
I think the only difference is we have the promised final product already... which in the religious case would be heaven and ours Bitcoin. Turns out its not so perfect so lets make it better

@_date: 2016-06-05 21:08:15
If I could imagin what its like to be a devout religious person Id assume my BTC faith would be closest to that. Except with real world logical reasonings and maths rather than a situation where you had been told about btc but never witnessed it or used it. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 06:50:57
So is it worth me getting excited about your passing?
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:12:54
Lets create a smart contract where if my btc is not attributed with bits after  an 8 month period of time then all btc in my designated wallet is sent to your address. Otherwise your shit outa luck for me sending it to you when the troll is eating my face.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:51:08
Knowing where they went is no problem 
. Just getting them back
@_date: 2016-06-07 01:57:43
Or tax it.  I was talking about this to a friend and the topic came up of the tax exempt religious groups.  If you believe in SN and his return then I don't see how it's different from a religion.  Let's do this!  Haha

Would you be required to pay tax if u never got it out just say brought a car directly with btc. No conversion to fiat
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:34:54

@_date: 2016-11-08 04:34:41


Thanks that all worked fine I followed your instructions but changed the "port forward mode" to "single" and made sure my bitcoin client was connected otherwise the port would not just stay open. Also used "8333" not "8333-8333" for service ports 
@_date: 2016-11-03 02:29:58
avast shows win32:evo-gen virus ?
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:12:18


I have seen it at 10 connections? does that mean my port is actually open? even tho the bitnodes is showing im unreachable?
@_date: 2016-11-07 05:03:21
Thanks. Im gonna get this working anyway, was just looking for a quick "this is what your doing wrong"
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:18:22
You're just paranoid...
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:58:48
What I don't get is why would you want a hard cap 32mb system like BIP100 when BIP101 has room to keep Bitcoin expanding? Isn't this what we all want? Global adoption. Its like BIP100 kicks the can down the road but BIP101 has a much bigger boot? It seems like the adoption curve of BIP101 makes far more sense than the violent up curve of BIP100 within one year and then hitting the roof?

Lightning wont be usefull in one off transactions though? How would that work with me buying from a mainstream website? Can anyone jump into a lightning instance? Or does a new chain need to be created evertime?

@_date: 2017-10-31 12:27:50
Spend it you bastards. Spend it all...... 
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:13:31

@_date: 2015-04-03 00:45:31
I also use mycellium. If i loose my phone but have my 12 word pass phrase is that all thats required to restore onto a new phone and also how exactly does the pass phrase calculate ur private key?
