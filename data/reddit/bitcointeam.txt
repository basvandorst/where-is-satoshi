If you make a wallet on blockchain.info for your main storage - and back up your private keys somewhere safe (there's a function there to download a copy of your wallet) - then put bitcoins on localbitcoins.com for as short a time as possible.

I agree that is a downside, even if it were technically possible and practical to create massive payment channels with thousands of participants.

And make sure at least one of your backups is *off-site*. e.g. You could store an encrypted copy at work or at a friend's house, or upload somewhere.

If that 'mistake' qualifies as an idiom, then people writing 'then' in comparisons when they mean 'than', is also just an idiom. In fact, why correct any prolific grammatical error?
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:37:59


0.2 is 20% though... surely you've heard '20% faster'?
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:09:46
Oh for sure; I'm not saying there's currently no need for your service. You must realise though that it won't last forever, and I would be surprised if you didn't agree with me that the entire planet is trending toward 100% free calls (That might still take a decade or more though).

I wish you luck with it, but I am not your target customer; hardly do any traditional voice calls at all anymore because of skype, viber and kakoatalk on my phone, and in general contacting businesses via email. Even many businesses in Korea let you call them via kakaotalk (voip software). 
p.s. I was joking about 'newsbtc' not choosing to name their company 'newsxbt'.

They were late to the 'Sony Walkman' party and the 'Microsoft Tablet PC' party though, and that turned out okay for them.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:30:58
If they're truly interchangeable, then that would technically make phrases like '0.2x faster' and '1.2x faster' are interchangeable - both are used to mean a 20% *increase* in common (stupid) English.

Bitpay (or possibly other bitcoin merchant processors) might also be worth having a conversation with.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:53:03


Let me rephrase then using percentages... the terms '20% faster' and '120% faster' are interchangeable?
 
@_date: 2016-09-16 10:07:42
I see how this could be much cheaper than traditional voice calls, but still, it's 1000x more expensive than if the caller and recipient have an average internet connection with voip software (e.g. two callers on opposite sides of the planet doing a voice call with skype on their phone). I suppose that's what the world is converging towards - practically free calls from anyone to anyone.

Maybe he thinks bitcoins have some kind of 'official' price which happens to be higher than that which Gemini discovered naturally today through buy/sell pressure.
@_date: 2016-09-18 05:17:41


This is 100% correct, and doesn't negate my assertion.
Twice **as fast as** 10 mph is 20 mph, and **two times faster than** 10 mph is 30 mph.


Absolutely correct there - an increase of 200% is actually "three times as much".


Boooh, incorrect. you were doing so well, too.
And if you're going to cite computer science links as an authority of proper English, perhaps you can tell us all which of the following is spelled correctly:

Possibly off-topic with regards to your question, but get your wallet backups in order *before* you send truckloads of bitcoin to them.

Yes, but they are relatively cheap in general.
@_date: 2016-09-18 07:26:12
Exactly my point. Just like 305% "faster" = 405% "as fast", or written in decimals, 3.05x faster = 4.05x as fast.

Long version: Reality, practicality, minuscule profits, high risk, frustrating delays... probably a few things are stopping people from doing arbitrage.
Also, the mere act of arbitrage has the natural effect of closing the price gap, so it's not even a permanent gig. You're constantly having to find new places.
If anyone's thinking of trying it, my advice *is to try it* (if for nothing else but to realise you don't want to be doing it) - but don't do so with your life savings.
@_date: 2016-09-19 00:12:46


And that's exactly how I'm using it. The addition comes from words like 'bigger', 'faster', 'stronger', 'more', which aren't mandatory in phrases like 'four times as fast as' or 'four times the speed of'.

Just remember that right before any company collapse, there were probably people depositing, thinking "I'll just store this on there briefly".
MtGox collapsed with something like 650,000 BTC owing - you can probably imagine that many of those depositors thought they'd be okay because they weren't planning on keeping their money there long-term.

x(1+1.5) = 2.5


x(1+0.65) = 4.05


No, it's still only 3.05 times faster.
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:46:33
That makes a lot of sense in the case where you have one payment channel per pair of people, but isn't it possible to have a single payment channel for more than 2 people? It would then be less of an issue, as more of your 'adhoc' spending is likely to occur within that group. I wonder what the limit is.... could a payment channel be opened by a community of 1000 people?
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:35:36
I wish I was. It's incredible to me how simple mathematics (combined with simple English 'faster than' vs 'as fast as') is not understood. Given that the OP is clearly very good at maths, I can only assume it was an English slip in this instance.

This phrasing is correct. 4x original speed is 3x faster. 'Four times faster' than 1 is.... 5.

In addition, turning someone else's gold into lead would have an indirect impact on all the remaining gold, including any owned by the thief. So in the analogy, it's not like the incentive to steal has been removed completely.

I temporarily had success between an Australian bitcoin exchange (can't remember the name now) and Mt Gox.   The reason I was able to profit, is because I had an Australian bank account, and a 100% verified and approved gox account so I could snap up opportunities immediately - that was the only edge I had over any other would-be arbitrageurs - anyone else (any Australian at least), could have set everything up just like I had, but they couldn't do it instantly - getting everything set up and approved on those 2 exchanges took a month or so. So I enjoyed a bit of a monopoly at that time. As I said though, it has the natural effect of closing the price gap, so taking advantage of the opportunity also diminished it.

We'll try to make the process as smooth as possible. It won't be much different from seeing a deposit address or QR code on the auction site directly. There are many more things to consider when securing bitcoins on-site.

Thanks. It will have escrow and mobile-friendly design by default. I'll have to look up 'USP'.
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:38:15
Ease-of-use is always a big one, thanks. As far as the 'stores' idea goes, what we have currently are just public 'user profiles', which shows all the user's (public) details including what items they have for sale. I guess on that public page, we could allow the user to customize it much further, to add a store 'header' graphic and some individualized welcome text, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:36:23
Thank you for your suggestions. Some of the things you speak of are directly payment related, however the site is not currently being designed to handle payments directly. When you pay for something, or make a deposit, it posts you to a separate site (think bitpay), which handles the actual bitcoin addresses and presents QR codes, etc. So we'll have to think about how that affects our users' ability to choose the number of confirmations they prefer.
API automation is definitely something we'd be keen for.
