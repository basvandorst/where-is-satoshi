lol the internet is not as popular and influential as you think bro. sorry mate. it is a statistically sound statement to make when I say "almost no one cares about reddit".

"killer apps" still don't solve the problem of actually distributing bitcoins to people. say I don't want to go the hassle and risk of using an exchange (mtGox), pay the enormous spreads of bitcoin atms (often 30 or more dollars over spot), or take the personal risk of using local bitcoins (you honestly want me to buy any sizeable amount of bitcoins for cash and hope I don't get robbed), what options do I have?

enjoy your bitcoins :)

buzzfeed. bbc news. the guardian.
lmao. you're going to have to do a -lot- better than that. try some original content next time, or at the very least, a news source whose main goal isn't "entertainment". 
also, pretty hilarious that you have a copy and paste ready for every time someone calls into question the relevance of bitcoin or the internet. you fucking nerd losers are all the same: desperate.

wow you wasted a lot of time trying to prove me wrong. too bad none of those links change this fact: reddit, in the grand scheme of things, is not popular, and has little to no relevance.

they hold a (very) large amount of bitcoins for liquidity purposes and their entire business model depends on the value of those bitcoins going up. 
lmao at the people saying they "don't need to make money yet". yeah man why would a business need to make money. we don't need to include that into the model. just as long as we have a lot of eyeballs, that pesky "money" problem will solve itself!
can't believe you all haven't seen this before.
