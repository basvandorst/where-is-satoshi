*  *This whole thing could be disrupted by government-backed digital currency.*
And herein lies the rub and *why* there is that 'echo chamber' mentality you mention that 'shouts down' the naysayers, for overall people are *shit scared* that this fantastic *idea* of "de-centralized currency" will be *forced* into submission by TPTB and the *essence of Bitcoin* will be lost and it *will become* just another method of digital accounting *rather than* the "de-centralized *un*controlled" currency it still is.
Sure it's got problems, it definitely needs refining, but the *idea* of cryptocurrency *should stay the same*-- decentralized and only 'run' by *everyone* involved, which a government based system wouldn't be.
And TBH I don't blame them one bit for their protectiveness of the 'idea' of Btc, in fact i concur and support it!
I only wish I had more answers!

   &gt;Their money was seized under an increasingly controversial area of law known as civil asset forfeiture, which allows law enforcement agents to take property they suspect of being tied to crime even if no criminal charges are filed. Law enforcement agencies get to keep a share of whatever is forfeited.




  
 &gt;There is nothing illegal about depositing less than $10,000cash unless it is done specifically to evade the reporting requirement. But often a mere bank statement is enough for investigators to obtain a seizure warrant.

I have been aware of the 'highly sophisticated stupidity' of the current world financial market, for a *long* time.
 For almost as long I have been wondering what 'currency' would be a viable *and* 'fair', uniworld currency.
I considered electricity and 'kilowatt hours' as a universal 'standard' but it had too many flaws
Bitcoin, however, *is* THE perfect currency, for all the reasons outlined in this article *and* some!
This world has many problems and solutions are few and far between! 
Amazingly **Bitcoin IS THE Solution** it is the ultimate unifying and balancing currency which responds to it's users and nothing else
The sooner we *all* start doing at the *very least*, some trade in Btc the better.  It will be a turbulent few years as this protocol is adopted but we will *all benefit* in the long run
When you think about it, the large proportion of the money you spend is in only a few areas, shelter and sustenance, fuel and power.  If we could access these services with Btcs we would virtually do away with cash. Sure maybe we'd need to forgo some of our favorite novelties who don't accept Btc, but it wont be too long before they adapt or die.
**We the people, the 'average' people, now have the 'power' to challenge TPTB and win**
It wont happen overnight, but if we all begin to accept and back Bitcoin, it *will* happen!
Keep it up everyone, and thank you forever Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever you are

It amazes me that people here *are still arguing* over a 'concept' that has been around for thousands of years and as many 'variants' .... that is, "currency" aka 'money'
 And there are many who argue the semantics of this matter when they have little to do with how Btc actually "works" .... 
"money" is simply *a representation of* "energy",, and a way to transfer one type of 'energy' into another' 
 Btc *does exactly the same thing* as ANY other form of 'fiscal currency' .... it allows people to trade with each other and "transfer the *value*" of different goods amongst each other, no more, no less.
 
e.g. I build houses and you grow food, but I don't want a 'houses worth of food' and you wont swap me a tomato for a brick, so what do we do? 
 At first we could use a metal with an "agreed value" like gold, but it has it's limits,  and so, next ... 
 We 'create' a form of 'IOU's' that *everyone agrees* are 'worth' what it says on the 'paper' ... (aka fiat money) and as those bits of paper *will let me* ( literally) "swap a brick for a tomato" by having a way of 'turning my labor' (bricks and mortar) into something you will 'swap' for your labor (tomatoes) ... this is a 'medium' we call 'money', and 'currency' is the *physical representation* of this medium for exchange we call 'money'
Over time *we come to an agreement* on just how many tomatoes I can swap for a brick, or any other number of goods and services, and we  stop using gold as a common form of transfer, and begin to use "money" **becoz everyone agrees on it's value**  and  it's "value" is *only* what's been 'agreed upon' by *all* it's users.
 Btc is just another way of doing these 'transactions' in a way that was never possible before *until* the 'computing power' became available (as it has in the past 10yrs) and like *any* 'new' technology, it takes a while to adapt
 BUT, it (cryptocurrency) has a number of unique features that make it *highly advantageous* for many people to use, e.g it 'eliminates the middlemen' (who *all want* a piece of the pie) and allows it's users to do something they were never able to before now, which is to trade amongst each other *without the involvement* of large financial institutions in their business.
 Well, that's the theory, and in practice it works quite well. Sure, like *any* new technology, it's going to have some teething troubles as it's *unprecedented* ,, and those who are quick to speculate about this 'new technology' are doomed to be  mistaken!
 UNLIKE *every* other currency out there, Btc **is not designed to be 'speculated and traded'  with, that's not it's purpose.**
It's **sole purpose** is to be a way for humans to *fairly* trade with each other. 
 It's not a vehicle for 'speculators' (something which "central bank controlled fiat" e.g. U.S. FedRes 'notes' are) which is anathema to "established banking practices" (and IMO the reason behind *all this media bullshit and FUD* ,, it's their attempt to stop Btc from "undermining" the market which they *currently control* and do not wish to 'lose' a percentage point of!)
 However, the more people who adopt Btc, the *more stable* it becomes, and the more people use it, each time they remove a tiny bit of the 'power' centralized banks like The Federal Reserve and HSBC have, 
 And if you're like me, you too can see the damage being wreaked across the world by these greedy corporations, you too  will TRY to DO just a little to help this 'baby called Bitcoin' mature into a powerful 'adult' currency that's one of honest need, not greed
  I think the advent of cryptocurrencies is inevitable, however, it's not in the interests of TPTB for this to happen, and so they're doing their best to stop it's evolution *whichever way they can!*

* corrup*tion* bro
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:18:05
hmmm sorry but I don't agree that the 'standard rules of currency' apply to Bitcoin
Simply for one becoz of the way Btcs are generated or 'mined' ... as well as the *fact* their *must only be* an agreed upon and finite amount of Bitcoins/satoshi's, at any given time.
 
Sadly I can see several serious problems with the development of Btc *unless* it is taken under the wing of a major,stable, fiat currency so that it can establish a base value, imo the Silk Road helped develop Btcs 'agreed value' more than any other use, and as the SR grew, so did the 'value' of Btcs!
 Logically, as the limited amount of Btcs grow in popularity and use, the 'value' of Btcs can only grow, and if a large amount of Btcs are just sitting in wallets, unused, then the 'active' Btcs 'value' can become skewed upward.
Bitcoins still have a way to go before I would consider them a 'stable' currency, but they are a 'viable' currency.  The biggest problem for Btc users at the moment must lie with the traders, who must adjust prices accordingly to the fiat they cash out in.  
  
And herein lies the primary problem of all currency with an arbitrary value
 Becoz the relative 'value' of Btc is currently linked to  fiat, most of which is based upon the $US .... and becoz one can't solely spend Btcs for everything they need/want. Until that day comes when they can access everything they want with Btc, Btc will remain connected to fiat currency.
This is why the US desire  to regulate Btc. And as long as they remain interchangeable *and* interchanged, I doubt this desire will go away!
*until the price of goods and services is directly related to their cost*, we will continue to be fucked by those with 'more' money!
 
Until we have access to 'free' energy, we will stay slaves to those who provide it!
And don't they know it!

that aint gonna happen in any hurry!
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:05:05


and herein lies the rub!   
The US Govt has NO desire to see a 'decentralized' currency that they have NO control over, becoming prevalent in this World, let alone the US!
 The *only* way the US has been so 'successful' has been largely due to the strict CONTROLS placed on the trading of the US dollar by anyone not sanctioned to do so!
The international money markets and associated rules are for the BIG players, if you aren't in that top 0.05%, chances are you never will be ... so they have no 'reason' to cater to the 'little guy'
And they most certainly do not want to see these 'controls' weakened in *any* way, which Bitcoins not only *can do!* by removing the power from their 'central bank' aka The Federal Reserve .... 
which they DO do, by removing the Fed from the equation altogether
The PTB never even considered an electronic currency in their schemes, shit, not even in their *dreams!*
The reality of Bitcoins is that they create an independent decentralized 'authority' which no one controls, and this could be the beginning of the end for fiat currency as we know it, which scares the hell out of TPTB/US Federal Reserve

 “We believe that – for a number of reasons – putting in place appropriate regulatory safeguards for virtual currencies will be beneficial to the long-term strength of the virtual currency industry,” said NYSDFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky in a statement.
Yet Btc has it's own regulations, and doesn't need to be 'regulated=controlled' by the US Govt! 
Bitcoins  certainly don't need regulation for "long term strength!"
 
The only 'regulation' they want for Bitcoins is to shut it down!
We have see the results of 'regulation' in the US in the past and the consequences affected the whole world!
 The argument that Btc's are used by the black market is a classic straw man, as the US dollar has been the main currency for illicit activities since it's inception!
Bottom line ..... it is ALL ABOUT CONTROL .... they have control of the worlds primary currency and truly fear losing it to Btcs, which are virtually impossible for them to tax, and definitely beyond their control!
IF the US can't have a big slice of the pie, they sure don't want anyone to have a pie in the first place!
this guy puts it perfectly .....
Bitcoin cannot be regulated – that is kinda the point – there are no records of transactions, there are no charge backs, everything is encrypted. To regulate bitcoin is to shut down bitcoin.
In fact, the nature of NOT being regulated is EXACTLY why bitcoin became popular in the first place – things like people having their deposits taken by banks in Cypress cannot happen on bitcoin. The people of cypress trusted these “regulated financial institutions” which made bad investments, and then had the government hand over their customers money to pay for these investments – straight robbery.
In the USA, the federal reserve continues to print and dump money into the economy, all the while knowing it causes inflation, and lowers the value of the US dollar – the federal reserve is “regulated” also
There are other methods that banks / governments use to rob people through “regulation” and the premise behind bitcoin is to avoid all that – If it becomes regulated, it will fail as a currency. (Then it will be no better than the imaginary federal reserve currency)
