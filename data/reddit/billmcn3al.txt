Nice tip
@_date: 2019-03-25 23:32:09
You said what I was thinking
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:54:20
1 week and they scratched each other's eyes out
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:05:15
Sounds exactly the same as hitbtc

That's not Kraken fault but your wife's bank. Deposits take 1 day max for me
@_date: 2019-02-14 18:51:59
Hahaha made me laugh

@_date: 2019-04-16 19:59:16
Hahaha so recognisable
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:20:19
Good luck. They can't rally so much ppl anyway
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:02:10
Well and how is that working out for you so far?
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:09:32
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:11:54
Good for you.  Keep it up!
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:56:55
Well according to you btc is the place to put all your money in so maybe at that time you'll pay me 10K a week
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:06:06
So bad it made me cry
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:17:28
I'm so glad to hear that at least someone is happy about his investment
Personally I would have waited till the first drop to 2800 USD..
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:40:40
And for don't reason I'm not rich
Something must have gone wrong
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:51:27
So true, you nailed it
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:36:21
What for nonsense is this!?!
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:11:45
That part of Europe is sh*thole anyway
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:59:03
That would be the second drop ;)
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:28:07
Sure... I wish you good luck with keeping up with the popular sayings and the rise of btc trough your coordinated mass buy.. or is it your time to sell then..
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:25:08
Yes you are
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:12:21
Surely you must be doing something better between 12 and 1 pm on NYE?! Get a life
