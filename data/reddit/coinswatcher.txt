Thank you OP for this find.

I personally want to hear more about the other companies. I have a list in my mind of what they will be but pure speculation at the moment.

Tom is vanished from earth, people start resigning. Hmmm indeed.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:46:18
Good call, you did the right thing. Let us host it that way.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:59:41
Read this on some news site like two weeks ago. Don't remember which one but they totally called it.

I'm not majorly connected but I like the work and when I saw he was in the area recently from Twitter I sent him a DM and he sat down with me in person and we had a chat.
Very real person, very down to earth. Just always chasing stories.

Do we have that many fucking retards here who are upvoting this not realizing that Google doesn't own Twitch. It was a rumor that Google was going to buy it, they haven't actually fucking bought it yet. /facepalm
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:02:43
That was the first thing I noticed as well. Did the same this morning LOL
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:57:02
I am glad you did but they fixed it and gave a solution. Why keep bashing what is clearly a good thing? Like this is actually one of the better ideas I have seen yet.
Why keep being a dick? Your first comment was good but the ongoing bashing of the idea is a dick move.
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:28:21
Some targets in my mind:
- Swarm
- Mastercoin
- Bitnation

Finally had a chance to meet with Mike from the site today as i saw he was in DC because of his twitter location and sent him a DM. Guy seems to be working pretty hard on stories like this.
After hearing some of the drama I believe we will hear a lot more about the other companies soon.
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:09:51
Plenty of people are doing significantly better and based on the karma from these comments it appears most people believe this is a pretty fucking deceptive thing they are doing.
I can think of at least four sites right now that aren't pulling this sort of trashy shit and are significantly better sites than this one.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:57:35
Exactly. People are so quick to be assholes.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:58:37
All I can think about is NWO 4 LIFE. Damn you classic WCW.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:53:51
No, the voice of reason would say anyone can do a tiny bit of research and see this is a very obvious scam.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:55:18
It takes all of one minute to type GAW Miners Scam on Google.
I vet every company that way. Company Name Scam.
You can tell what complaints are just made up and which ones are legitimate fairly quickly.
Yes, everything can appear to be a scam to an unhappy person but sometimes things are a bit more clear than others.
This one is quite clear.

I don't understand why the fuck people keep upvoting this bucketshop. People can stop this... easily. Look at what Shapeshift.io did after the last Tom on BTC piece.
Perhaps people just need to take some action here. Stop upvoting pieces from CCN because we know they won't be banned from posting here and the robots won't stop upvoting the pieces they publish.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:35:00
You do realize that CCN has been scrubbed right?
Why don't you go shill somewhere else. Tom on BTC is one of the most standup people on bitcoin.
He published countless works in the past exposing massive frauds before he was threatened heavily by foreign interests and for his personal safety had to remove all of his writings from the internet.
Without him some of the massive corruption in the foundation wouldn't have been exposed.
I think *you* need to do some more research before you go around claiming this guy isn't credible.
Mr. Fargo has done the things stated, and the words about Amazon, Target, Walmart and what not are his. A quick search of archived pages on the internet shows that.
Don't try to make this seem not credible because it doesn't fall in line with what your boss Mr. Garza claims. Go suck his cock some more and learn to do a bit more research on who you are talking about.

Perhaps the conference is just as guilty as the scam for taking the scammers money and then becoming involved with the scam.

I think Coin Fire is completely warranted in this case.
We've seen a lot of the "old guard" come in to reddit and try to stir the controversy down because they are afraid of what light it casts on them as well.
As I read this, it said to me, stop reporting on the issue as well because it is on the homepage currently.
Bruce are you invested in anything that doesn't have an MSB right now?
That said, I get coinfire being a bit defensive, the guy does get threats, the site gets slammed and josh is suing him. I think the guy gets a bit of slack tonight.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:08:21
Going to agree with Bruce on this although I remember him being with Moe and saying they needed light on this stuff with Vorhees as well.
No matter that though, it is in the past now. We just need to move forward.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:38:31
We all just have to stop giving them a platform. If you see pieces from them... don't upvote them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:49:33
Since your advertising network is heavily promoting the paycoin scam I will refrain from visiting, promoting, or sharing any links relevant to your site until a choice is made to stop promoting paycoin.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:09:39
Not sure why this is downvoted. This documentary looks great, the story on the site looks good, perhaps we are all over it now?
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:53:18
This is very clearly a scam. Look at the news pieces coming out. Call Amazon yourself, call the SEC. Lots of red flags on this one. This is the most obvious scam to date.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:50:51
Yes, it is. He is taking money from the scam.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:07:18
I thought it was about coinfire as well. Good to see you stated it wasn't though.
I don't think coinfire is a critic against gaw. They have reported the news in this situation as they have in the past.
That said, it is okay we know some shit is happening. Just take a break tonight. You've done plenty.
