The problem with this is companies need a reliable income stream. Waiting for a handout is typically not the best solution. People may or may not donate, but having advertising to sell creates an asset with revenue that can be relied on to further expand the business or service.
Bitcoin really has nothing to do with what you're talking about.

You type in who you want to send to and hit the big button. The transaction is protected with special code that makes it hard for the coppers to find out what happened to the bitcoin.

During the California gold rush, many mining supply companies generated more profits than the miners themselves. Sometimes I feel this way about Bitcoin. Companies are selling $50,000 mining computers - will that person ever make the 50 stacks back (with electricity) in reasonable time, and still stand to profit enough to make it worth his time as more people join the Bitcoin crowd? Hard to say, but mining suppliers are getting loaded online just like they did back in 1848.... 1848.... 48..... (Eric Cartman flashback)
