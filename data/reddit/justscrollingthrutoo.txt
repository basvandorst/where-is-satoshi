Yeah but it has a 200 billion dollar market cap. There hasn't been a single scam in history worth that much has there? Like honestly, if this turns out to be some elaborate scam then this will literally go down in history as the biggest one like ever... by a very long shot.

We want this to be adopted widespread dude. That's good for you and all but don't sit here and act like everyone is gonna track every transaction. Like the reason debit cards took off is because people could stop balancing their checkbook. Be realistic here. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:42:53
More like bitcoin is gonna go up to 50k then crash back down to 20k. Similar to the 20k run to 3k.
A 5k drop isht even a crash. That's just a whale fucking with people.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:11:42
The crazy thing is we have enough in our savings to pay for it all. I'm like why the fuck wouldnt we just use that? 
Him - because what if we have an actual emergency? 
Me - THEN we sell the crypto...
He doesnt nessecarily even believe in the technology. Hes only in because of me. And I get it. I'd be hard pressed to not take a 10k profit after 3 months lol. I've been in this bitch for years though. I'm looking to pay our house off in 5. Not a little deck.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:14:01
No I meant on the end of this bull run. When bitcoin drops 5k total in price I'll know the bull is done and the bear is out.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:47:14
Ok, so schools are built. Pack it up boys. We dont need anymore money into educating our young. No need to pay teachers. They love their job and wanna do it for free.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:30:44
Ok, so that's an ok idea. Particularly the moving of the power away from federal to a state / city level. And we could even cut the budget significantly but it would still need to be high enough to defend against all  threats world wide.
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:57:57
Yeah someone capable of writing that level of code, isnt just gonna lose his private keys. My bet and what others have said before. He never touched the first few blocks because he was steadily mining and is so rich already he doesnt need that 1 mill bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:46:51
You obviously trade so let's talk. I've noticed a 2 year pattern. Up 2 down 2. My prediction is a run to 50ish over the next year maybe year and a half. And then a 2 year drop down to 20 to reset. What are you thinking?
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:25:47
You are asking to get in trouble man. This is why the crypto space is struggling to take off. I dont want to hide my money from the government. Do you want anarchy or something? If no one paid taxes, you wouldnt have roads, schools, military. Like I want banks to collapse and people to have access to their own money. Not total fucking 1st world anarchy...
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:02:20
... you actually mined and you thought it was a good idea to try and cushion the blow by trading bitcoin into an alt? That's like the exact opposite of what you do. You normally throw you alts into bitcoin to soften blows...
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:58:17
So how are you proposing we pay for teachers? You are throwing all this out here but you dont have a SINGLE solution for the very real problems we would have with no central government.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:41:43
Dude I cant wait to watch it. I got into crypto when bitcoin first passed 7k and litecoin was trending up around 80. I bought it and watched it go from 7k to 21k and 80 to 360 in literally 3 days. Then over the course of 2 years I watched it crash. I never sold. But I also bought in at s fair price. It didnt matter that bitcoin crashed to 6k because i was in at 7k. But i cant imagine what that feeling would be like if I bought in at 20k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:56:03
I sold at 17k. Bought at 3500. Planning on buying when it drops 5k this time. That'll let me know its back into a bear market. 2-3 drops arent anomalous. But a 5k drop is. That's my plan anyways.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:14:30
Wow... I said you're not proposing ANY solutions to ANY of the problems that would come. Not that you need a single solution for everything...
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:21:48
Right. I just hit the half mark last month. I'm trying to get a full one before the real bull run goes but I also wanna hit my marks with ethereum and litecoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:46:02
Because I'm not a programmer. I cant look at the white paper and see it works. I had to just trust that the random people on the internet were right and that this worked and was revolutionary. That's mainly why. People will always be skeptical of shit they quite literally cant confirm for themself.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:22:03
My deck just rotted through. Partner wants to sell his crypto to pay for it. I told him I'd work overtime the next two weeks before I let him fucking touch it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:40:57
Honestly I have a solid 2, 5, and 10 year plan for crypto. Everything I'm seeing has bitcoin on a 2 year swing. Up for 2. Down for 2. Ignoring the everyday ups and downs this holds true. So ima wait another year or so and whenever bitcoin drops 5k I'll sell. Because that's when I believe the bull run will be over and itll be crashing hard again. Ima save all my money and buy back in when it crashes. 
Btw this strategy worked quite well for me during the last run. I sold at 17k and bought back in at 3500.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:03:14
Oh dude, I bought 10x my original investment while bitcoin was sub 4k a few months ago. Literally was dumping half my paycheck in it as soon as it started dipping below 5k every 2 weeks  Rofl now I'm just laughing to the bank.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:47:25
Whoa whoa whoa rich fella. Dont be going around telling people you have multiple bitcoins. Seriously... I know this is anonymous but yeah
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:54:46
Yes but I also think we just saw the worst crash in bitcoin history. The media hyped it up so much and so many people got out when it started dropping. Those same people will know yo hold next time.
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:03:28
I mean litecoin is literally the test net for bitcoin. If it wasnt for litecoin, bitcoin wouldnt have the lightning network....
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:21:55
You use absolutely zero capital letters when most phones will do the first letter for you... so that means you taught your phone to literally type shit wrong. And you called me stupid...
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:06:23
And name one functioning place in the entire world successfully doing this? You cant. Period.
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:08:17
Eh, I bought at 9k, 12k, and 14k.... guess what? I bought a shitload more at 3k and now I'm actually in the green total. It's only a bad investment if you let it become a bad investment by panic selling. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:09:28
If you look at a chart of bitcoins price overall it does tend to make massive leaps every 2 years or so. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:05:18
I'm making more off crypto in the last 2 years with the enormous crash than I have in the stock market putting equal amounts into each. So no... it wasnt. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:42:09
I'm in the u.s. idk where you're at. And yeah I don't think in ever gonna see ethereum at 98 again. That's what I meant by losing out. I bank transferred when it hit that real low a week or two back. Same with litecoin and bitcoin. When it dropped to 20 and 3200 respectively. I lost a good chunk instead of just buying and having a fee. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:12:17
Eh, that's not always the best way. Like this past week I bank transferred. It took 5 days and the price of crypto jumped almost 20%. I easily lost 50 bucks instead of just paying a 5 dollar fee. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 14:47:29
... or ya know... bitcoin was at 3200 and ethereum under 100. I SERIOUSLY doubt we ever see this again. It spiked 20% and even with a 20% spike it's a good price. Not everyone on the internet is a dumbass. But you sure made yourself look like a douche.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:35:51
Honestly bitcoin ethereum and litecoin all just need one thing. Amazon accepting it. If that happens we are set. It will happen. Just a matter of when. It makes sense we use crypto to shop online. That's the easiest and safest way for us to use it. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:38:23
Lol ikr
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:43:47
You're a gift sent from God. I'm laughing so fucking hard right now. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:11:08
Because the person capable of writing this level of code is probably ENORMOUSLY successful and didnt need any of the money coming from bitcoin.
