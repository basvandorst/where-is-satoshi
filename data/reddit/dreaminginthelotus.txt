finished undergrad with essentially zero debt (worked fulltime). made the mistake (at least in my opinion) of getting a 'professional' degree which has led to (not so) suprisingly less than expected earnings.  total cost of school was over $200,000 in fed loans, plus some private.  After a few years of interest, $300,000+.  Looking to switch careers, but literally locked in.

hope that answered your question somewhat.

I agree. As an adult looking to change careers with over $300,000 in student loans (finished undergrad with almost nothing, essentially all from obtaining a 'professional' degree; read waste of time) the burden of debt (and effects on life) can be huge.  The recent surge in bitcoin value is providing a *glimmer* of hope for fools like me (although I am still a LONG way away from being able erase that mistake).  
The one thing anyone should consider in regards to this topic:
As bitcoin continues to equilibrate with existing stores of money it gains value through that porcess, rather than the surge of speculation we are seeing now.  I.E. if 21,000,000 bitcoins are in equilibrium with $400,000,000,000 they 'worth' roughly $19,000 a piece (but because they will be circulating between multiple currencies the value should be much higher, b/c they will never be in isolated flux with one currency).  Therefore there is a lot more growth that we should expect (unfortunately this doesn't happen from bitcoins being hoarded; we see speculative growth rather than real equilibration).  What I would suggest is that rather than pay the full balance of your loans, just sell fractions of bitcoins needed to pay the interest on the loans (tax deductable), and consider paying them off fully once the growth curve slows down.  Consider: you could have payed them off enitely with 8.6 BTC today, and perhaps 1 BTC in a year or two.
As far as taxes:
Yes, selling bitcoin, regardless of its status as a legal currency in the United States (assuming you are here) should be treated as capital gains for tax purposes.  What that means is that you should set aside 28% of what you sold for 'THE MAN'.  You may be able to get away with dodging it this year, but if you went through coinbase (or mtgox recently) there is a good chance there is a direct paper trail (they are trying to play by the books now to avoid getting knocked).
Either way, I really like hearing stories like this, and please do not take my thoughts as criticism.  I am truly glad you are debt free.
