Actually a good article. Covers a lot of points. Not to critical or optimistic.
Like the ending:
Many people who were involved when the internet was emerging feel the same excitement today, when they look into Bitcoin. As Fred Wilson puts it: “We are at beginning of an exciting time, not just for investors but for all of society.”

Moving that many coins on any exchange raises eyebrows. It's not that easy to convert large amount of BTC to fiat.

The profit window for mining is in the first few weeks of getting the equipment up. I don't see cloud mining services working any differently from hardware producers. 
1) Take customers money 
2) Setup mining operation and 'test' services 
3) Take first mining profits 
4) Payout customers after apologies for several weeks or months of delay.

I don't think your silly for storing your bitcoin with MtGox. None of the exchanges are perfect and MtGox did have a record of recovering from mistakes. 
I'm sick of the "I told you so" people who are "smart" and kept there 0.5 BTC in a cold storage wallet.

Nice article, but too focused on the currency part. We don't need Aunt Sally to buy a Bitcoin we need her to use the Bitcoin technology.
Money is flowing into Bitcoin right now, but it's flowing towards the tech companies. The trick is to make the technology more usable. Bitreserve.org is a great example. fiat-to-fiat transfers at zero cost. (using bitcoin as a technology)
My perfect world: The general public uses Bitcoin. The techies understand Bitcoin. No need to educate the people that don't get it.

It basically means you cannot use investing in virtual coins as a leverage inside another financial product. Just like trading in life insurances. They are both high risk and should not be combined into another financial product. (lessons learned from the past)
Extreme example:
Start a fund investing in green energy. Promise a 20% ROI. The fund invests money into solar powered dwarfs (ROI 4%) The other 16% is compensated with high risk investments into virtual currencies.
People tend to look at the dwarfs and forget the high risk part. 
I kinda agree. Although not in this magnitude.

Nothing new here. I was blocked in 2013. One call and I was able to buy again. It's website specific. I never had this problem with clevercoin for instance. 
Title should read: ING blocks Ideal transactions by default on bitconic.nl 
Stop with the FUD it is giving me a heart attack ;)

Add clevercoin.net for Dutch BTC exchange
