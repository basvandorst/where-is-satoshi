Via their wallet application.

Met this guy and used this machine during Fosdem this weekend. It worked, and it is customizable.
Initially when testing we used his Bitcoin wallet from which we bought BTCs with Euros through this machine.
But the creator told us that once you will get it you can customize the exchange rates, wallet endpoints this system will be using.

I have never watched Fox News in my life, I exercise the thing called critical thinking.
russian soldiers were taken hostage by the Ukrainian forces. 
Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, one of the most interesting NGOs [claims something different that your officials](
So maybe they are also part of NATOs propaganda machine?
History will judge you, and the shame which lasts from the last century will stay with you for longer. Take a lesson from Germany how to deal with your past, your future generations will thank you.

good call, heading there!
Seems someone from Japan was accessing my account from two IPs around that time.

Go away with this childish propaganda to the worldnews please.

For me your perception is just comical.
Yesterday we had 25 anniversary of fall of Berlin Wall. 
You may try to build walls now, but they will fall.

it's not propaganda it's at last according to the [NATO sources Russian military personal presence is a fact](
Russia invaded independent country, stole their territory, is supporting a terrorist groups on it's territory, and you still are justifying this crimes.
No one believes your lies, the longer you deny the more comical you are seen.

I wasn't unfortunately.
But I was accessing this wallet (would like to know how do they log access attempt) only with coinbase app. 
Since it's SSL, I felt safe.
Few lessons from that I will get.

Well, I would say it's mathematically possible, but practically unlikely, I use quite decent password, and do not see really how anyone would start bruteforcing my account. 
I'm not a merchant, just a guy who sometimes likes to pay for his beer in that way.
Also, I'm surprised that they do not study login patterns, since I live in Germany, and someone was accessing my account from Japan (according to the logs on Account Activity), this should be enough to block this access attempt.
If facebook/linkedin can do it, Coinbase should be competent to do it too.

I do not think it's that simple.
For me, Coinbase should be competent enough protect my account, or if they are not, they should force 2FA.

Even facebook can detect nonstandard patterns in logging, 
Someone used Japanese IP, when account was using all time German one, still impossible? 
Anyway, agreed that I made a mistake trusting them with my money.

They do lots of great stuff in this organisation.
They purchased in the 22 years of working 140 mln Euro of medical equipment, saving hundreds of lives.
They focus on equipment and treatment of kids for most of the time.
Truly amazing people.
