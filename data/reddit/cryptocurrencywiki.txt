Hey thanks for the offer, I've been thinking about in over the last week, but I've decided to just let someone else takeover and move on to other things.
I've put both domains up for auction with no reserve price, so feel free to put in any bid if you'd like the domain(s)...
Hey there, I decided to just stop stuffing around and put them to auction with no reserve price.  So feel free to put in any bid you like, and you'll probably win the auction(s).
I can give the buyer this reddit account too if they like.
I never did any marketing for the site or anything, although it seems to rank fairly well for the search term "cryptocurrency wiki" due to the domain name on its own.

Not expecting a huge amount, but most likely willing to sell for $50-$100.  You can enter offers here:
