So do people pay taxes they are not obligated to? Do Canadians voluntarily pay American taxes out of ideological support for the concept of taxation? No. Similarly, people generally do not pay ransoms that they are not a party to,, even if they think its a neat idea.
The difference between a taxpayer and a random onlooker to a ransom note is that the random onlooker has no obligation or motivation to donate.

So long as there is no agreement of an upper limit with a higher bank, this holds. Otherwise, the agreement of an upper limit for the lower bank to lend is effectively a loan from the higher bank. The poof of money would only really be meaningful when someone without an upper limit granted by someone else has their debt repaid, since that entity has an infinite amount of money, and infinity + 3 dollars is still infinity.
Does this seem sound?

So essentially loans, exchange, and physical storage. Yes, these are thing we agree on, bitcoin won't loan you money, or turn your bitcoin balance into wompum for you, and you cannot put a cabbage in it.
Edit 2:
As for deposit functions you can do all of these with bitcoin:
* Current deposits: any sort of immediate transaction with yourself. You do not have to put your bitcoin in your mattress.
* Fixed &amp; Savings deposits: transactions with yourself that use a lock time to say when the transaction is valid. If you destroy the private key, you will not be able to write any more withdrawal transactions, and you cannot get the transaction to go through until the condition for the lock time is valid. You can do any mixture of fixed and savings deposits with single or multiple withdrawl conditions. You can also add immediately valid transactions with penalties that will give the penalty to miners as a fee if you would like the option of immediate withdrawal. That is something most banks won't let you do: make a savings or fixed deposit without the option of early withdrawal.
Bitcoin can do quite a bit of these other things too.
* investment and shares: color coins.
* reference and statistics: the blockchain can be used to prove financial associations and provide statistical and relational data.
* during natural calamities, bitcoin can be used to to disburse funds
I mean, it does quite a lot, but it isn't capable of physical or socially interacting with users. You need physical and social entities for this. Not necessarily banks though.

I get your point, but I think it is incorrect. Government tries to control violence. That is what rule of law is. It is so people aren't inclined to shoot each other in the street over a bad poker hand, and so that those with less control of violence (the weak, the elderly) can still benefit from justice. 
Sometimes this works out, sometimes it doesn't. Your position is that it is never a good thing. That is ignorance of observationally obvious evidence to the contrary. If you think rule of law is so oppressive, then please feel free not to call the police when your house is robbed.
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:59:37
The organic part of IRC is human communication, not market dynamics. But they are both organic phenomena.
Miners having to follow a protocol to actually mine does not imply they are doing it for free. Why someone uses a tool does not effect whether or not they are using a tool, or how the tool works. Just because you use a hammer to make a living doesn't mean it no longer drives nails into wood. It gets you money and it drives nails. There is no dichotomy.
If you are saying that bitcoin 'is' the economics of mining, I would say I disagree. That is really more of an external influence on bitcoin usage.

1. Nobody said "the people" I said people. And I said often. This all implies only some of the people some of the time.
2. 'Rule of law' is a specific term with a specific meaning. That meaning has nothing to do with laws ruling. It has to do with governments enforcing laws rather than citzens. At least, this is the practical implication of isz meaning. I am not talking about ideals, I am talking about its realization in practice.
3. Source is I have been robbed and my homeowners insurance required a police report to process the claim. I am pretty sure most insurance claims that assume a crime has been committed require a police report.
4. OK.
5. Well you obvious live in some kind of black and white cartoon. You are essentially of the position that everything that government does I'd bad, because it does bad things. Nobody is asking you to like government. Nobody is saying that they are completely benevolent entities. But they exist, and we have little choice in the matter, and we have the ability to use them to our advantage. I think its can be beneficial to do so.

Its a thing here in Tampa too. Theres a group that feeds clothes and buys prepaid phones for the local homeless. The park they use to do this is generally litered with old crusty clothes and prepaid phone packaging the next day. 
If nothing else it helps them to get back in contact with family and friends that might be able to help them bootstrap their reintegration into the world of domestic employed life. If they could work out a way to actually use it to secure some income (with something like bitcoin) that would be awesome too.

The word deregulation seems as misleading here as the word trustless is in decentralization and cryptography. In the case of deregulation, you are really just moving the control of regulation away from governments and into the hands of financial organizations. In the case of trustlessness, you are moving trust away from financial organizations and toward algorithmic/cryptographic rules,  the competance and honesty of those who implement them, and network consesus that results from their application. 
In neither case is the burden of regulation or trust really lessened for the user, it is just reorganized. Some group is still out there writing the rules and forming consensus. If you don't trust that group, and you do not understand exactly how the rules work, you still have a problem. If you are not served by the interests of the shift in regulatory authority, you still have a problem.
Its a zero sum word game. Trust and regulation never really 'go away'.
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:39:51
The important thing to acknowledge is that there is no such thing as a transaction that has nothing to do with you so long as you have some stake in the security of the network. The mining of all blocks has an effect on the security of your stake in the network.

I think this is the real answer. Its not that hard to think you know what you are doing if the consequences of being wrong are usually low, which they are.

The video game economy is not really tied to console manufacturers any more. And this is why market manipulation is BAD. A segment of some industry losing money does not indicate failure of the industry. It often indicates that someone else is providing similar services and products but at lower cost to both themselves and consumers. However, short-sigtedness and panic politics leads us to think the sky is falling and we need to prop it up.
The industry has evolved to take advantage of the technology that has come about since having a console was the only way for the average person to play a video game. Almost every human being in the developed world has a video game console in their pocket now, and this is where game dev has decided to move to.
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:31:55
Yes you are right. And for this reason, your interpretation is not only convoluted, but implies something dubious. Increasing the number of bitcoin is only damaging to the value of the currency if it is minted. If all past transactions are instead interpreted as involving some power of 10 factor increase, then the fact that there are 1000x more coins doesn't matter, because you have always owned 1000x more than you previously thought. It instantly corrects for inflation by injecting the new coins into past transactions.
It is not at all like actually adding to circulation in a normal currency.

IDK if trezor is supposed to be secure against economically feasible physical tampering, but if it were, they could add their own key with 100 odd bitcoins associated with it, and allow the device to only sign small non-transaction messages with it.
That way, you could know that the key is stored on the device, but someone would have to compromise it to get at their coins. And once someone does this and spends their coins, everyone watching the address knows not to trust their trezor anymore.
Many microcontroller allow developers/oems to lock the memory to prevent reading from outside of the hardware. So an attacker would have to defeat read protection to get at the key, which they would need to get malware on to the device, and also be able to sign messages with it.
Kind of a built in bounty for at least some portion of security auditing
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:51:05
Because the cost isn't just to the person making the transaction, its spread equally to all bitcoin holders proportional to their holdings. Its essentially the cost of securing the network, and those with the largest holdings have more at stake.
You aren't paying $40 bucks, you are paying some insignificant portion of it. Looking at the actual value of bitcoin, the effect of this is completely lost in the noise.

Nothing about 'global' implies central. In fact, it generally implies some ability to take into account local variance. Taking into account local variance is at odds with centrality.
Individual sovereignty (or whatever) is fine, so long as there is a broader framework that it fits into to arrive at some sort of consensus. Otherwise it's just going to more of the same, with 'individually sovereign' players going around eliminating each other rather than competing and cooperating. That would just be feudalism.

No, I wouldn't say that. Mining is a role defined by the protocol. There would be no such thing as mining if it were not. The protocol is what incentivizes mining too. People mined before it was rely profitable, because they wanted to use the protocol.

But why do you think they are mutually exclusive? While the miners are directed by economies, they mine by following a protocol.
Consider an unrelated protocol, just off the top of my head: IRC. The interactions are directed by people, but the are following a protocol. At one level you have human communications, as ad-hoc and organic as they are anywhere else, but what facilitates this is a regular language, a protocol, that is not organic nor human at all.

As are radio signals. My point really isn't one of semantics though. Its that ultimately what is safe for qrcodes and bitcoin is safe for wireless and bitcoin, since you cannot really perform a MITM attack on bitcoin transactions.
The trick isn't communications medium, its handling of keying material. So long as your privkeys are not at risk of discovery when using wireless, wireless poses very little security risk.
 What we really need is consumer accessible hardware that only exposes keys to be read by signing logic. There are actually quite a few cheap and easy to work with microcontrollers that have lock bits to say what has access to key storage memory, have built in ecdsa functionality, and provide a economic and time intensive barrier to discovery even with full physical access.
You can put a key in, and sign transactions with it, but it is practically unreadable and unrecoverable otherwise. Hardware security is what bitcoin needs, and really, its mostly a matter of someone bring a solution to market. Someone with about 300 bucks, crypto, ee, and embedded programming experience could produce a working prototype in like a week. A consumer version would cost like 10 bucks maybe to produce.

I don't think this is really that confusing though. Unless maybe you are looking for a delivery service that pays you in bitcoin for USD deliveries. For the purpose of statistics, it does suggest however that there might be more businesses accepting bitcoin in the area than listed.
"Every store accepts bitcoin if you convert it to cash first" has absolutely nothing to do with this though. Why would you convert your money to cash in order to accept cash? You don't directly pay the delivery service.

Think of it like this. The protcol is like a flat hot balloon. You might look at it and go "what a worthless piece of crap, it just sits there". The users are air (those writing transactions, relaying them around, and mining them). The economic pressure is heat.
Really none of these things is doing anything interesting on its own. But when you put them together, they can fly. You might say "well they fly because of hot air, that is where all then energy for upward movement is!". But they need something specifically designed to take advantage of that to lift and move people and control that movement.
If you just took hot air out into an open field and tried to fly around, well good luck. That is what miners are. Hot air with no balloon. The balloon is a defining part of the relationship, as is the protocol.

@_date: 2014-06-17 00:19:40
1. You are right, it doesn't do all the work, but some useful infrastructure is possible. Banks usually do not do any of the enforcement, governments do.
2. Yes it can. Again the blockchain doesn't do all the work, but it most certainly does provide a means form proving financial association and does given you statistical and relational data. It does NOT give you proof of human identity or tell younevrything about every transaction, but if you know one of these things (identity or nature of a transaction) you can connect them to other transactions that you might know something about, and draw logical conclusions from these relations. You can sign messages, associating them with addresses and transactions, and thereby prove a financial association. You can add arbitrary data to the block chain to help provide some of the information that isn't natively encoded in it.
You seem to think its an all or nothing proposition, it isn't. Bitcoin does some of these things to certain degrees. Possibly making banking as it is currently understood a less necessary thing. Completely unecessary for people that already aren't using most of the non-bitcoin covered functionality.

Yeah, revokable keys are a pretty handy way to make 0-conf bitcoin transactions safe for software vendors.
You could also issue a temporary key (valid for a couple days) that can be exchanged for a permanent key once the transaction is confirmed. That way you do not need to check for revokation certificates each time the game is installed/launched. 
Temporary keys have a expiration timestamp (set for a couple days in the future), and permanent keys have an expiration timestamp for some time in the distant future. The key issuer only needs to hold on to temporary keys long enough to exchange them for permanent keys, and doesn't need to store permanent keys at all.
The customer is issued a temp key immediately (once the transaction is received from the network), and is issued a permanent key once the issuer sees x confirmations. This could all be handle via email, so the user is notified as soon as a permanent key is issued and has a record of it so that there is no need for the issuer to store keys long term.

Yes its tool is violence, just like yours is (the gun you will use on the burgalar). Is the fact that you control violence with violence equivalent to "people that own guns use force on innocent people for personal gain"? No. Does it happen? Yes.
Democratic governments often represent the interests of people. If all they did was run around shooting innocent people, then we would be living in a very different society.
Oh, and BTW, the reason why your insurance company is inclined honor the agreement you have with them is partially to do with rule of law. They too are someone you have to trust, who has their own agenda. And also, you cannot file an insurance claim for a burglary without a police report. You also need the police to verify that you shooting said burglar was defense of property, or else people might come to their own conclusions and show up at your house with torches and pictforks.
As you can see, the government does a little bit more than just act like cartoon mobsters.

Online piracy works because there is no one who gives a crap about federal penalties for pirating video between your collection of mamas family DVD's and your computer 10 feet away. There is a regulatory gateway between the average Americans income and the bitcoin network. You can get around it, but that isn't something your grandmother is willing to do (go buy bitcoin from some stranger in a McDonalds parking lot).
You keep equivcoating fundamentally different things. Bitcoin is not piracy, its really nothing at all like it. Taking advantage of representative government is not supporting child murder. 
If your idea of helping to improve bitcoin is not doing anything at all, well, at least there is that.

An unsuccessful scammer that gets away is better than a successful one that gets away. If the address is published, there is a possibility that we will gleen some useful information in the event that bitcoin does find its way in and out of the address. Not publishing it just markes it more likely that a successful scammer can keep scamming.
I really do not follow you guys logic. Criminals are not known for getting by on sub-cent profit margins, which is really about as much as an uninvolved party would be willing to bait a spend with.

This is a decent explanation. Its not so much that the money disappears, its that it never existed at all, because its just an account of debt. Right?
But at this point it is 6 of 1 half dozen of another. Saying that member banks can have credit up to a certain limit is like saying they can have money up to a certain limit, since fiat is an account of debt. Since the issuing authority is blessing off on a certain amount of credit, its like they are giving you a loan for that amount. You (the member bank) have money, that you have to give back later. 
Now what happens when the debt is repaid to the issuing authority is kind of inconsequential since it can make more. At that point I can see saying it is destroyed, but not just when anyone repays a debt to anyone else. Not everyone in the banking system can inject units of account into the system unencumbered.

I would not bother with random numbers and characters. If you want extra security, add more words to your passphrase. Character level complexity adds very little to security and makes remembering a pain long term. Even with a training program like you suggest, I would stick to words.

This is the sort of thing that would make bitcoin easy for the average Joe, and safe(r) for pretty much everyone. The biggest hazard for the average  bitcoin user is probably proper handling of crypto material.
All of the restrictions listed would be great not just for theft mitigation, but giving bitcoin to semi-trusted parties for specific purposes (lunch money for your kid, etc.).

It is not too much to ask to support infrastructure without supporting mass murder of children. Did Jared Polis mass murder children? How exactly is working with a congressman who is pro-bitcoin on issues that have an impact on the usability of bitcoin supporting mass murder? Is using the postal service supporting mass murder? Is using a police officer to fill the role an estimator supporting mass murder?
You cannot possibly think every tenuous relationship to the violence of governance is responsible for it, or is supporting it.
Government is going to have an impact on the usability of bitcoin. We don't currently have any technical solution applicable at the place where the usability is affected by government. So our options (as far as what is doable in the short term) are work with government, or do nothing and hope everything goes favorably.
Only one of these is a productive strategy.

There isn't actually any difference between "adding precision" and "increasing number of coins, then redefining all the denominations" in so far as the software is concerned.

I do know there is more than one type of money. And I understand that fiat is an account of debt (I didn't need the explanation), however If iI loan you 3 bucks, and then you pay me back 3 bucks the next day, whether we are accounting for these dollars as coins or goats or scratch marks on a chalkboard. Nothing disappears between us. I get my money back. I regain the power to loan it back out, regardless of how itns accounted for. You still haven't explained this magical disappearance of money.
The only disappearance I can see happening is if you pay back debt to an issuing authority (I don't think you have a mortgage finance by.the federal reserve), in which case their ability to print money makes any sort of accounting for their debt a little silly.

In a perfect world where the entire bitcoin economy was on the blockchain, this might be attainable (assuming governments cant just fragment the network or mandate a block on bitcoin traffic), but it is not the reality of bitcoin. Bitcoin is vulnerable around the edges where it is exchanged for government regulated currencies. They don't have to know much at all about bitcoin or care about consensus and cryptography if they can just regulate the exchange of bitcoin for their money by their citizens.
At some utopian point in the future when the internet its self is a decentralized crypto network, and nobody bothers with government issued currencies, then bitcoin is safe from the inexpensive attacks governments are capable of. In the mean time, we should take all the help we can get.
@_date: 2014-06-23 13:04:51
Well, the hardware is pretty cheap. If the business side of bitcoin keeps growing like it is, they will want a safe way to manage their bitcoin without 3 computers, a bunch of paper in a safe and having to take photos of qrcodes off of their screens.
Its easy to to exchange small amounts securely now. But only small amounts, and this assumes that only a few people carry it around and are bitcoin aware. 
A hardware wallet need not be anymore costly than about 50usd or any less convenient than a credit card.

They are the same in that they both use decentralized storage, but vastly different in purpose and mechanics. Freenet requires that your data be useful to other people for it remain accessible if your node goes down. You could not throw something private out onto freenet and expect it to be accessible for very long. You essentially have to self host until your content is popular enough to be getting routed to a significant portion of the network.
Storj doesn't really care if the data is popular. The user pays for storage.

I disagree with his 'dematerializing' bullet. Bitcoin is immaterial right now, but you can make private keys more of a 'something you have', than a 'something yo know'. People are generally good at following physical  security best practices and horrible at following information security best practice.
Plus, as blockchain technology evolves, there are going to more and more physical systems strengthened and empowered by decentralized cryptographic proof and consensus.
People have an intution about physical security that will make using bitcoin much less error prone and user friendly once hardware wallets make it to market.

Because security goes both ways. You need to be able to use your data in the presence of adversarial actors, but with that, you need to be able to use your data. Ease of use and accessibility are just as important as keeping your data safe.
I think losing keys is as big of an issue as having them stolen. I know in general, losing data is way more common than its secrecy being compromised.

So over all it is deflationary. We are talking about the value of a currency in relation to the value of goods and services. Regardless of what economic phenomena is responsible for that relationship. The bitcoin economy is growing faster than circulation is. That is the important part.
Its not true at all to say bitcoin is more inflationary than the us dollar if economic growth is actually making it deflationary, and the us dollar is still losing value in relation to goods and services.

Not anonymous authors though, they would have to self identify to lodge a complaint :P
I say you start by charging not very much, and only providing limited services so no significant amount of trust is necessary. As the amount of books you publish grows, and younestablishna reputation, you can adjust the number and cost.of services to match your reputation. Also, break your service down into isolated milestones, so if at somepoint the relationship breaksdown, you have gotten paid for the work you have done, and they have recieved what they have paid for, and the relationship can end without significant loss for either party.
 On the side of trusting you with their identity, I don't think they need to. Is it necessary from a business standpoint to know your customers, as a publisher? There are ways to communicate with a customer and exchange services for money without providing identification.
It sounds like a cool idea though, and I wish you luck.

If they gave atleast some of it away, the value adding members of the economy could recoup their losses from devaluation of their holdings. That it was practically free for the first entity that was able to spend it is how it causes inflation. Adding more currency to an economy without adding more value (product, service, whatever), devalues the currency as a whole. The whole worth of the economy is accounted for with the currency. A sum of money entering the economy that is not acompanied by an equally valuable sum of products and services essentially sucks value from the economy.  The assumption is that currency accounts for something of value, which newly printed money does not.
Printing money doesn't /always/ effect circulation (they have to account for the stuff the take out of circulation) but it does when it does sometimes.
