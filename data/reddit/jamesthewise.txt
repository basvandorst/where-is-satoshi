If this is all pre-planned and you are a time traveler then you'd have all the dips planned out as you obviously claim to. And you last time said you'd next be back in 2020 meaning you know that's the next big dip. It's not even been a year and is certainly not 2020. What gives?
Also interesting you use a classic "Mandela Effect" as an example of a difference in your timeline. but that's not a question, just of note.

More appropriate for r/libertarian
Get a better more in depth answer likely.
Simply put the government TAKES the fruits of one mans labor then distributes it to othera. I use public roadways. Thats essentially the only gov benefit i "take back". 
So therefore everything not used for road repair is theft right? Im not seeing any of it.
The govt takes my money and i get little to no benefit.
If i dont give them their extortion money i go to jail.
Sounds like forced theft to me.
Id be open to taxes if i could at LEAST choose where they go. IE "I want 3% to go to military, 20% to college grants, etc"
At least then i could choose where my stolen money goes.

Possibly. With a password funds cant be moved and if your seed or priv key are retained you should be able to get that money back before they figure out your password. Quick as typing it into existance in another wallet.
Maybe i overthought it. But yes funds shound be SAFU with some simple precautions.

My exact thoughts. Anyone whos been in BTC for a year or more should have read enough Satoshi content to realize this blaring loud egotist cannot be him. If not then just go read some Satoshi posts on BTC Talk.
It simply in no way reflects the way Satoshi talked/carried himself on line. This at the baseline is enough for me. No similar speech, online mannerisms and no access to any accounts or private keys.
Theres really nothing going FOR the guy. Everything points against him.

Certainly they will do their best but last i heard they were well understaffed and underfunded. Theyre only going to be able to parse their time out so many more ways. Hence why they made the announcemdnt.
It was a bluff. Maybe not in full but a good catch all to cause fear and paranoia when one is considering whether to report. 
Basically know your shit and avoid mixing KYC and untraceable holder/origin funds if you DO feel like trying to skirt taxes or have a stash.

What he means is until it is recorded on the blockchain, at least once, it is literally not a transaction. It has not happened and there is not a guarantee it will in the future since it is still unfound and without a block.   
How likely is that to be exploited? Not likely by 90% of people at least.  
Technically, however, there cannot be a zero conf transaction as no transaction has occurred with zero confirmations. It's all theoretical still at that point. Very likely to follow through. Not recorded on the blockchain in any measurable and provable way however.

Maybe is probably the best answer.
Fundamental investment advice is no. You fill the long term guaranteed "security money" bin first. Then you can fill the growth options bin.
However this is potentially a once in a lifetime or once in a millenia investment so if its money that youd be ok with letting burn in a fire, just in case, id say toss it in.
You could also do a portion 30% BTC 70% something "safer". Whatever you or a financial advisor may determine that to be. Such as opening an IRA.
The answer lies in how potentially reckless youre willing to be with your first major investment.

Yes and no?
Yes it is a currency. But not like Bitcoin. Its a different style.
ETHER is primarily (at least originally) a platform for DApps and Smart Contracts first and a currency second i would say.
BTC is almost purely a currency/reserve which is adding similar features through Lightning Network. Or it will at least allow the introduction of such things should people choose to build them.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:48:20
Yes you can make money this way.
Usually you just wind up losing BTC.
Since you just came to this realization id look and learn some market dynamics first before trading. Just so you stand a chance. 
One wrong trade and that $100 is 0 BTC and like $60 if you panic sell.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:26:44
Nope even crypto to crypto is taxed. If you buy $100 in BTC and convert it to ETH while BTC is at $300 then you owe capital gains on the $200 even though nothing was ever cashed out.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:34:18
As far as I understand youd have to withdraw all the money from from Robinhood to get real BTC with it.
After that set up an account with Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini or a similar exchange. Buy the BTC with RH money on one of these exchanges.
You can look into/buy a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet for long term storage or next best if not better is Bitcoin Core wallet on an offline computer. 
Hopefully someone can chime in more info. Limited for time.

Yes. This one's been laid out since 2014.  
ANY transactions or conversions which see an increase or decrease in value (IE not a perfect $300 of BTC to $300 of ETH) must be reported. If you had BTC and sold a top, bought a bottom, sold a top, then re-bought and held the BTC you would still owe tax on each trade.  
It all has to be reported unfortunately.

You shouldn't be holding much more than spending money on a mobile phone anyway. So hopefully this wasn't your primary wallet.  
If not that is another lesson learned. Sorry if it seems harsh but these are the very features that make Bitcoin such a wonderful choice for the individual. Your money is completely under your control. No one can take it if stored properly and no government can grab it. Likewise, if you mess up your end by losing critical information, it's equivalent to a bank losing all information on your account. You are the bank.   
If you want something safer, since really only spending money should be stored on a mobile wallet in current Mobile Security Standards, then you can use a custodial wallet. You're probably pretty safe keeping a few hundred bucks on a Coinbase Wallet or something similar which is custodial. It's never ideal - not your keys not your coins - but it does provide a way to simply sign in to access money across any device at anytime and provides customer service in most cases when needed.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:01:16
Technically you don't NEED BTC either but WANT it. No harm no foul. If my computer or monitor broke tomorrow I would prioritize that over BTC. Sometimes real life calls.

Stock ownership is stock ownership, you dont get a certificate or anything. However you are logged into databases and that company knows you own stock. So its always yours hence how its insured.

Hey sorry but you mentioned Exodus so maybe you know. I only keep some ETH and BAT on Exodus. My BTC is safely stored.
But how does having one master seed phrase work? I don't get backups for multiple wallets. You just get one.
So if something happened would I have to put that seed in another multi coin wallet with all supported coins?
Or does that seed work independently in say a BTC wallet, ETH wallet and DASH wallet. Each time recovering the single asset in different wallets with the same seed?
I don't understand the 'Master Private Key' thing. Sorry if you aren't aware. Just taking a shot here.
@_date: 2019-11-25 22:54:18
YES! This is what I've been saying all along.  
It turns out Elon is Satoshi - I've confirmed this through my own Technical Analysis of Satoshi's writings.  
Elon, or 'Satoshi', did in deed keep a few hundred BTC in an address no one's traced the origin of to this day.  
Yesterday, while on the phone with Elon, he mentioned to me that he had to fund the Cyber Truck by dipping into his 'stash'. I was assuming he meant his weed stash but then it ALL clicked!   
Elon IS in fact Satoshi. And Elon's been holding this few hundred BTC stash just to fund a venture when desperate.  
While running low on real physical cash, something you cannot tell by networth, Elon in a fit of genius tanked the market to by selling all his BTC. Now this plan was two fold.  
1. Elon gets his cybertruck funding
2. Satoshi himself helps the whales get us back to $6000 a little quicker so we can blast off upon hitting that landing pad thus increasing the price of any BTC he may have stashed still.   
Elon is Satoshi, he tanked the market by market selling hundreds of BTC and this both funds his cybertruck while helping move Bitcoin's correction to it's end.  
I'm unsure if he held on to any of his original BTC he stashed out of public view. He likely won't tell me but I'll be sure to ask him on our conference call tomorrow.

I don't need to be paid. I might be willing to help if you're serious which it appears you are. Although you've gotta start somewhere. Start with planning. Treat this as a business.   
Step 1 before I or anyone can help you: Learn to plan, learn to present, learn when/where to present.   
Also don't get ahead of yourself. Almost no one's willing to help someone with a 'dream' in the dream phase. There's a reason venture capitalist only invest in things which are up and running or have a prototype. Do you even have a prototype?  
For you a prototype would be a Youtube channel with a few thousand subscribers and some video/documentation of you spreading the word and awareness and the process.  
At that point you have a 'prototype' and people such as I may be willing to come to your aid.

Honestly the easiest way to get privacy is buy buying small amounts (&gt;$700 in a single tx at mine) at a local BTM. You will pay a nice fee over spot, typically 7-11%, but it's truly anonymous with no KYC. 
So basically comes down to, for simplicity, do you have a local BTM and if so how much is your privacy worth to you?
The gift card specific I've no clue. I know there used to be plenty who take Gift Cards on local bitcoins but as you stated they're KYCed out the ass now like coinbase.
Outside of that, ask around?

If so contact trezor customer support OP.

@_date: 2019-11-16 17:22:33
Honestly BTC has some mixed signals right now. Even as someone who believes in and has used TA to perfectly time some purchases (I dont trade... HODL my crypto) it's not worth the effort right now.
Technically speaking without a higher high we could still be in a bear market. 
But 7200-7500 seems impossible to break.
10k has shown just as much strength as resistance.
TLDR: this time it really does go up or down with nearly no way to tell. Just ride the wave of uncertainty.

Well the primary point of the recovery, according to Exodus own website, is in case Exodus gets hacked or goes offline. Which I agree with. I'm sure I could go exodus to exodus no problem. That's not what I'm worried about.
I'm more worried about the worst case scenario they mention. Which is why I'm asking. If exodus went down tomorrow and never came back online how would I use the master seed to recover two different assets. In this case my ETH and BAT? Granted this example is bad is its ETH and an ERC20 so nearly any wallet should have both. But as my example stated just out of curiosity what to do if exodus went down and I had say ETH and DASH all on the same master seed?

Idk what Green Wallet is but if they had mnemonics it's likely non custodial. Meaning its YOUR responsibility to keep your keys.
So if YOU lost your keys theres likely not much Green Wallet can do to help. It's gone like a fart in the wind.
With a new phone your priv keys would need to be put into the new phone to be reteieved. How is this done? A mnemonic seed.

Start basic if you need. Its KYC but Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken.

Thanks for answering and attempting to help btw.  
I dont hold many shitcoins but I may look to add a few more which is why I'm asking.  
My BTC is locked up as I've no intention of touching it for a long time and NEED that amount of money stored safely.  
My shitcoins are for selling for profit at any point should life needs arise. I'd have a hard time selling .1 BTC if something goes south in my life and I lost my job or something and needed help getting by.  
But I'd have no problem selling some of my shitcoins to get by. Little to no attachment lmao

You wont actually own any BTC. Its paper BTC so in essence useless and valueless outside the RH ecosystem. Highly reccomend avoiding if looking to accumulate REAL Bitcoin.
If you simply wanna try playing the market or test your endurance to volatility than RH may be right for you. You wont OWN any Bitcoin. But it will give you financial exposure.

If the banks were going to buy all the BTC they would've already. Price tends to go higher year over year and theres a smaller circulating supply year over year. 
Even now the best hope is buying all the BTC in circulation would be their best goal. And it's a pretty shit goal considering itd be easy to spot and likely scare many off.
It's the same reason 51% attacks would be unprofitable. If the trust is gone so is the value.
Banks/govt buying all the BTC in circulation would likely lead to a lack of trust and a waste of their fiat. All this just to kill little BTC.
I've a feeling most govts are more concerned about which country/currency will line back up on a gold or silver standard. 
A gold back Yuan for instance could rock the USD way harder and quicker than BTC has in 10 years.

This is honestly a dope shirt. I just can't bring myself to buy crypto related clothing. Unwanted attention/questions in the public.   
Just as well, and my main reason, I feel like any crypto shirt I'd buy would be better put into crypto.   
Imagine BTC has a bull run to something crazy like $100k and you bought 5 Crypto T-Shirts for about $100 while BTC was &gt;$10k. That couldve been a whole .01-.02 BTC!! $1000-2000 or 5 HODL shirts?  
I think if I buy crypto clothes, if ever, it would be after a large cash out. And then I'd probably not just because I'd feel pretentious.

I think you got this sorta wrong.
Most of us SAY we want it to go up. And who wouldnt. If you own 1 BTC you maybe on the road to 100k+. And we say this. Almost like choosing what we speak into the universe.
But most of us here REALLY want it to drop. Id need 6k to finish my projected plans from feb/march that got shattered. 
I would love and WANT 6k... Just dont really say it aloud ��
Edit: maybe this psychology, reverse psychology is what causes the drop? High artificial sentiment with true hopes of cheaper prices to buy more?
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:29:30
It happens. The worst time to accumulate it is  tomorrow. The best time is yesterday.
Today youre somewhere in between those. 
Make a decision now one way or the other and just sit back either way for at least a couple years and add even more to the stack if you wish.
Its like precious metals. Have a base stack to HODL and trade on the side if you want.

The descending triangle that broke out as expected according to Bulkowski's "Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns" is a pretty textbook (literally) case of TA working on BTC.  
This is why I said just by now. TA works when it works and doesn't when it doesn't. Timing markets is difficult.

Theres a lot to dissect from this simple picture and a lot to go into. But I'm just gonna leave you with this one correction so we both sorta win:
The median fee is $.20. Meaning most people are doing it for $.20 and not a dollar. Some ARE maybe paying a dollar.
However since $.20 is the median someone else is likely also getting their tx filled for mere pennies.
However I'd consider all of these a fair price to move bits on almost unarguably the most secure and definitely the oldest public ledger with the most amount of public trust and sentiment.

Ok now show me one from that list that could bring back even a ton (2000 lb) of material. Only one or two even brought back "samples". 90% are flybys.
I see nothing on that list that could be properly counted as a proof-of-concept for bringing back tons and tons of Gold or Silver ore.
Edit: Also neither of the small sample returns are back on Earth yet. Japan's will be in 2020 and the U.S.' in 2023  
Edit 2: One successful sample in 2010 after a failure initially. So 50%.

That applies to all markets. I day trade stock Options part time. There's a reason day traders in any market make 'scalp' trades that are quick and last anywhere from seconds to an hour or two.  
It's because there's always whales in the pond and you just gotta take your minnow profit and run before you're noticed.  
Just the name of the game. So, again, unless you're trading or attempting to time a purchase with the market (Have fun trying to time any market... let alone BTC and it's wild swings) then there is no concern on your end.  
You're a minnow. Know your place and let the whales do what they do.

I read through your post on the other side and their counter extremism gets me just as mad as some of the BTC extremism.
"The BTC camp cant be trusted" oh god were all just people tryna kill the dollar man. The sad thing with being the OG is BTC must now move off chain to get proper retail settlement. This is where Lightning comes in and hopefully succeeds. It's not 100% proven yet but looks promising from the start.
Theres also the fee issue. If BTC users decided, as a whole, to only use 1, 2 or 3 sat/byte fees I dont see why thered be on chain issue. But that's the free market. 
Not everyone can agree. Because someone wants to be SURE they're in the next block so they do 4 sat/byte. Then the next guy 5. And then we get to where we are today. 
But that's the free market. And BTC certainly enables a free market in nearly all respect. 
Increasing blocksize can only go so far. Nodes have to store all that data and large block size can make a blockchain really heavy really quick.
If BCH ever actually see a lot of use and full blocks this issue will become apparent down the road.

@_date: 2019-10-25 01:40:51
Oh how do futures work? Very much like margin usually.
I'm not sure the specific of BTC contracts but the future is an "agreement" to buy or sell BTC at a price on a date.
If you buy a futures contract to buy BTC for 9k on Oct 31st and BTC is really 11k, congrats! You win! Just saved 2k. I THINK that's how the BTC Bakkt futures work.
Other futures, like the s&amp;p 500 e-minis are tick by tick. So essentially margin. You can enter/exit the contract at any time and each 'tick's is not really worth a dollar but a significantly larger amount such as $100 or $1000 dollars.
So if the s&amp;p 500 futures moves in your way of your contract 5 points you can then sell that contract and gain your $500 or $5000.
Futures trading is sort of complicated relative to standard stock or commodity trading which is already complicated in it's own right.
Sorry mate. Just thought you were asking if you can get in! That's probably a no if you aren't a millionaire in regards to bakkt.
But nearly anyone with a decent networth can get approved for standard future trades on ToS, Tasty Works,etc.

So far, in 10 years of recorded trading, there's almost never been a 'wrong' time to buy outside of, currently, the 14-20k region.   
Market history so far states that there's no wrong time, just either a shorter or longer time period until desired ROI is achieved. Outside of a select few circumstances it's also nearly impossible to 'time the market'.  
You should be only putting in money you can afford to lose anyway. So if you feel the NEED to own some BTC, buy now. Worst case scenario is you have to wait a little longer to be in profit as price drops.  
Worst case scenario if you don't buy today is a big green dildo happens tomorrow and now you purchase half as much BTC as you could've yesterday.  
Most people don't believe TA works on BTC but I can say it works most of the time. Just not all the time. However this applies to ALL markets and ALL Technical Analysis.   
If you wanna answer the question yourself learn TA and market fundamentals. Although it's likely to leave you more confused.  
TLDR; no one can say for sure. You should probably just pull the trigger.

I would post these things here to help the normies out, even with a chance of being wrong, as ALL TA stands a chance of being wrong, but then I get attacked by people saying 'TA Doesn't work"!!   
well the Descending Triangle worked.  
The Bear Flag played out.  
TA doesn't work on ANY asset 100% of the time. But it works on most assets over 50% of the time. That is your 'edge' as Mark Douglas puts it in trading in the zone. But magically, in this sub, BTC is the one asset in history that is impossible to chart against human emotion and TA never works. I would've never put a buy order in at 8k.

Normally I would agree but this wouldn't be the first death cross BTC ignored completely before starting a bull run. 
I think it was 2015 it happened? Got a death cross right into the start of the next bull. Someone posted it on here recently so I double checked to confirm.
BTC is the one asset I dont actively trade as it can ignore your 'edge' far more than other assets. 
HOWEVER this was before all the eyes,institutions and generally extreme trade volume. So well see...
But BTC has historically been it's own beast. It's not afraid to throw TA out the window. It often DOES work but can go batshit in ways other currencies and assets dont. 
Hence the TA doesn't work on BTC meme always spouted here. It's true more frequently than on other assets.

Your coins can and likely will be traced no matter where you send them. This is because the point of origin is CB so tracing is easy. I'm on my phone so links are a bitch.
But if you want anonyminity you've now gotta mix them or finagle them back and forth through Monero.
Your best bet is mixing. Particularly on Wasabi (?) I believe it's called. I would do quite a few mixes to ensure anonyminity. The higher the fee you pay the better chance your coins aren't traceable. So keep that in mind. DONT just google and us any mixing service. Use Wasabi.
Wasabi also is/has a wallet I believe. But for.long term storage look into a hardware wallet such as a trezor/ledger.
No matter what wallet you use be careful to store your seed words and/or private key somewhere EXTREMELY safe. Pretend you're trying to hide ounces of gold. But on paper.

LMAO none of these are 'top traders'. Kirby is a known scammer. I almost didn't buy the bottom because of him.  
Alessios TA is good but he doesn't know crypto. He tries to apply Elliot Wave to everything and it almost never works except in hindsight.  
Tone Vays is still waiting to buy BTC at $1k likely cried for many months as we ran to $14k  
'The Moon' is just... idk what he is. But he doesn't get any of my attention like Kirby. Not for scamming. Just for almost always being incorrect.  
These are top traders only if you're a noob and can't do your own TA.  
I mean fuck we were oversold and formed a textbook  'Bullish Gartley' at the absolute bottom. Mitch Ray is the only guy I know who called it. Glad I put the pieces together myself instead of listening to Kirby or Alessio.

The ideas not bad at its core. And honestly and ironically as a firm BTC camp supporter... I keep LTC on my phone in case I come across a shopping use. It's really just quicker. 
So in my eyes Bitcoin Cash already exists. It's called Litecoin.
NOW I would NOT be opposed to a legitimate BTC cash. Although it sadly makes my LTC holdings obsolete...
Buuuuuut...  as pointed out centralization. I refuse to support a PoW coin without distributed hash. BTC is pretty good but even that's nowhere near what it used to be at truly 1 CPU = 1 vote.
If centralization creep is happening to BTC, which it is, and it seems to be a problem, which it is, then I would not support any 'form's of Bitcoin which has this problem ten fold.
At least BTC is still relatively spread among certain pools. And I know quite a few people via private message and youtube and the like who run a miner or two or 20 independently because of supporting the network and the network effect that naturally happens.
If I wasnt in bed I'd google/YT search "Setting up my Bitcoin Cash miner" but I've got a feeling thered be a lot less results.
Also BTC cash has a face. And a known entity at the top. So that's a no from me dawg.

Theres a lot to break down here. Such as pre halving hype,post halving selling, and the later new ATH which follows POST halving. 
Buy the rumor sell the news.
But the simple answer is likely just that LTC isn't BTC.
It's cool. And I also keep some LTC. It's nice as I can own dozens or hundreds at their price.
But LTC is not BTC. It can never be. The guy who created it is not only known but literally dumped his bags on the community at ATH.
What gives BTC real value period,its 'intrinsic' value if you will, is being a trustless non sovereign currency with an unknown creator who for 10 years has left their founding stash untouched and likely will indefinitely. 
BTC is the only crypto to have that as well as a 10 year history from humble open source origins with low risk of malicious actors in the early days as it was still a HUGE risk to adopt. Especially before it even had a price lmao.

No you just gotta time it. You did. 
Now would not be a good time. We CAN go as low as 6k but as of now theres really no guaranteed drops. Just likely drops.
A drop was guaranteed up there. Not guaranteed. Nothings guaranteed. But nearly certain. That was anlot of momentum WAY too fast for little to no catalyst.
Now were sensibly nearing the bottom which should be between 6-7.2k but BTC is tricky. It could take off tomorrow for no god damn reason. Plus,looking at the fib retracement from 3k to 14k were almost perfectly at the .618 retrace.
Another indicator this could be the end. It was best done above 10k. Anything now would just be reckless panic selling unless you can day trade it as the market gives you the signal.

The only downside to hitting $9k is if we hit it that puts us at the TOP of our down sloping equidistant trend we've been in since 14k. Meaning if we do see one final shake out.... itll happen at/after 9k.
Upside is after that well likely be home free.
Basically the only question rn is will there be a final dump to $6-7.2k before take off? Or will we burst right through 9k, finally get out of this downtrend and run free?
According to the simple TA of the downtrend,ik iK TA doesn't work, always wrong,etc, once we pop 9k with momentum were home free to start a new trend.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:15:56
BTC's doing fine but the alts are bleeding.  
Odds we back-test the Descending Channel we've been in since 14k are high. A backtest proper would take us to about 8800 before the next bounce.

A lot. It gets reposted over and over and over.
TLDR of it: BTC is great because as a public ledger it can track all the tx good and bad. If retards like this ever link ANY KYC to anything associated with and address they can be caught. This bust likely only happened BECAUSE of BTC.
BTC is only pseudo anonymous. 
The great thing is if you're careful theres ways to anonymously buy BTC and avoid KYC if you're smart. This is good for everyone including criminals. 
If criminals wise up this is no longer possible.
Basically comes out as a wash proving at best maybe BTC needs more inherent anonyminity. But if that were a thing then these busts likely wouldn't be a thing.
Double edged sword, yadda yadda yadda.
Pretty basic stuff if you know how BTC works.

As someone who stacks both I'd hate not to have both. Granted I'm more of a silver guy; greater scarcity and price potential plus a killer low G:S ratio right now.
Maybe move enough into BTC to buy 1 or 2 BTC. Let's call that's 20k and assume two.
Convert 5k to silver for more possible exponential returns than the gold.
And hold about 20k of the gold as the largest likely most stable cushion? Or skip the silver if you're incline and just do the 1 or 2 BTC. But it seems like you're looking for something with higher growth potential.
I'd go 2 BTC 5k into silver and 20k gold cushion. But in the ends it's your choice mate. BTC is volatile as you know in both the good and the bad times.

The large difference is Gold and Silver have thousands of years of historical use. What gives it value? Consensus.
For thousands of years humans have decided these rare earth metals are valuable. The only reason it seems like no big deal now is because how efficient modern mining is. Back in the day there's a good chance a man or two died getting you your one Oz of gold. But it's still fairly rare when compared to the other elements. Silver more so really, way less silver than gold.
But thousands of years of human Consensus has given gold it's value. 10 years of human consensus has given BTC it's value. All the price of anything is is human consensus and emotion. This is why TA works quite a bit of the time on a chart. All things are valued by human consensus of intellect and/or emotion in the case of how the 'chart' plays out on that item.
Things have value because we say they do. The longer that history is the harder that is to break. Gold/Silver have been used as money literally since the first bit of recorded human history. They've never NOT been money in recorded human history outside of periods of fiat in certain countries.
Instead of trying to tear gold and silver down a Bitcoiners best hope is really hoping to find/share the same space. As someone who stacks both I must admit while I understand BTC the value of my gold and silver feels FAR more substantial. This is because I'm comparing thousands of years of human history vs 10 years. The 10 feels a little flimsy, risky and not set in stone.
I'm quite certain my gold/silver stash will have value. By all fair estimates at least until we truly are mining from asteroids and the like. Even then it will likely take a while for value to go down as you fight 3,000+ years of human history. Humans don't like to change.
Sure BTC has more price potential theoretically but my gold and silver will almost always be worth SOMETHING no matter what happens. Even in a power outage or doomsday scenario. In fact I would argue particularly so in that case as a fiat paradigm starts collapsing.
BTC Maxis argue we could still trade off chain, via satellites, etc. But that's an AWFUL lot of work compared to just re-finding the value of a 1/10 oz silver coin that has proven to serve well enough as a day's wage for thousands of years. Especially considering less than 50 million people are likely/actively using BTC right now in a best case, decent economy and grid operating scenario.

I'm like the WSB autists but less of a gambler. If/when I trade i tend to be weekly options. My real preference is day trading though when I've got the free time. Even then I tend to do options as it's much lower capital for the same $500+ gains.
So my favorite trading style is my Cash Account on Tasty Works. I tend to do market open so I'm in and out quickly. This week I had a nice trade on NVDA at market open. Bought $3k worth of calls, about 10 contracts, and made $760 in about 20 minutes then sold my options.
Its sort of a degenerate hybrid style of trading but I love it.

Thanks mate appreciate it!  
Technically on the daily we are just shy of 'extremely oversold' as well but we are getting there. However we dipped below 30 on the dump from 8k. So I'm willing to bet there's more downside even if only to $7250 as you mention.  
Realistically looking at supports it still makes a lot of sense to me we touch $6k or near it again. But I'm not sure how realistic that is. This is the first drop where I'd truly start adding to my long term position.   
We DEFINITELY still got room to run down on the daily and weekly. Also being beneath some key EMAs is not helpful or confidence inspiring. Especially with a looming Death Cross.   
We'll see. BTC has never had this many eyes on it during a halvening. Can't wait to see how it plays out for better or worse.

The real problem with precious metals is definitely the history. Something that's been used as currency as has been the fall back from fiat for (I believe) something like 10,000 years or more will not just "Go Away" no matter how digital the world goes. And at the end of the day, in a true collapse, it is very unlikely Bitcoin will be valuable or even available after the Rage Phase when we enter into the Barter Phase and start rebuilding. Most infrastructure and electronics will likely have been destroyed. God forbid its by an EMP then Bitcoin's existence is forgotten.  
I think the odds of the extreme end are very low. But I do believe in the history of Gold/Silver as many others do for fall back from Fiat. Certainly governments and Central Banks do. For this reason I HODL PMs and Bitcoin.  
Admittedly I am 23 years old and my "Hedge/Risk Portfolio" reflects my age. It is 75% Crypto and 25% PMs currently. This should tell you which I trust more to store my wealth in the current state of the world.   
I like things such as the whole Gold to Bitcoin movement but that much human history and foundation for economic strength and stability will not just go away or dissolve into a non physical asset. There will be co-existence. And honestly I think and hope both will go up in the coming years as economies and currencies weaken.  
It is known Russia and China are starting to hoard gold like mad and many governments around the world are starting to call in their PMs from places such as London.  
I'm really tired of PMs vs BTC. They are both beautiful and should thrive. Personally I wouldn't mind a world where my physical currency is gold/silver and my "Card/Phone Pay" money is crypto. To me that is literally the ideal world although I admit that may seem extreme to most here. And that is ok.  
Let's just be happy together. We both think we have the only real money. Some of us are even smart enough to own both of the only "real monies".
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:02:49
Thats awesome im glad to here theres more people on this train of thought! ��
I see a lot of metal bashing when its brought up and it runs me dry. Although amdittedly it has been getting a bit better lately. Bitcoiners have a fair point though about ROI.
The difference is Bitcoin is Manipulatable. Medium sized actors can make large moves. However it doesnt seem to be completely restricted and manipulated as silver and gold. This is because theres much more silver and gold on paper than in reality. Im sure you know this.
The best way for both or either to flourish is for the value peg against fiat to become so weak they essentially transcend it. It has and does happen with gold/silver many many times throughout human history. PMs are at the start of almost every great civilization.
Well see what happens with BTC. If us hairless apes dont fuck this whole wireless digital world up in the foreseeable future and can remain mostly civil i think BTC has a fine future. Its already had a fine past.
Simply put, not a bad first 10 years. Thats for damn sure.

That'd likely be good implying its HODL time. Especially if they were already using CB which means less likely it's for an OTC sell...  
The reality... Who knows? BTC go up. BTC go down.  
If you're not trading or attempting to time a purchase with the market price then ignore the whales. You'll be a lot less stressed.  
A whale doesn't change BTCs status as essentially the only trust-less non-sovereign currency in the world.

We all got the same goal. Just different execution after a contentious hardfork. Also didn't help BCH camp tried forcing "BTC Core"name on what is simply and has always been "Bitcoin". No reason for the OG to change should YOU choose to stray to a new chain.
At the end of the day BTC still has most of the hash power and certainly the most distributed. Also the most transactions. So I stand with the majority.
The free market, as with fees, will sort this out one way or the other.

Have you checked the address in a block explorer to make sure the BTC is there/address is valid?

I actually just recently made a purchase at $6800. Otherwise I havent bought since we were at $6800 on that huge wick down before the summer run up that got eaten up.
Honestly starting to feel I may do some purchases in the $7-7.3k range now.
I wasnt sure this was bottom but its sure as hell starting to feel like it.
I wish I had my current savings back when we were at $3400. That was my largest purchase thankfully. But idk about a retest anymore. Were holding $6800 strong.
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:09:03
This is the best answer. Even if it's not 'showing' in the wallet on the network the BTC has been sent to the address created in that wallet and regardless of synchronization. You should already have the priv key or be able to recover it from the debug console with a little googling if you're unfamiliar.   
Just import the private key into another wallet.  
While you're at it, if a fan of core, just get a 1tb drive and use it for that sole purpose. Should future proof you size wise.

Tbf those are the kinda of people who could see BTC go to a million next year knowing they could've bought at any point and then say "Better to have lost a million than risked $3000". 
They're super conservative. Idk if it's the same sub situation but for instance I would never dream of saying the word Bitcoin on the FIRE subreddit. It's just not their style.
Both are subreddits for super conservative investors trying to max out a 401k that's really all it is.
I get the frustration. But if I was one of those super conservative Roth IRA and 401k makers who thought the dollar would live forever I wouldn't want us Bitcoin Degenerates in there either.
Have you read half the "investment" advice here? Outside of serious situations it's basically "Neglect the thing and actually buy more BTC instead of selling like you're asking". Its a degenerate style of investing if you're an outsider looking in.
I say fair play. 
Just as well if they came here trying to talk about maxing their 401k... they wouldn't be allowed. Sounds fair enough to me.

You buy Bitcoin through an exchange,not a wallet.  You transfer to a wallet after buying on the exchange.
Any major exchange is safe enough. Kraken, Gemini, Binance (US?), Coinbase as a last resort.
Buy on any of those exchanges then transfer to a wallet. If it's small sums Bitcoin Core on a desktop is not terrible. But your best bet is really dropping the $100ish on a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. Full control of your keys and offline storage.
You have a lot to learn. You really dont have any idea what you're talking about. Start here:

I think he;s talking about Private Keys or 2FA. If you did not set up 2FA for the website such as an authorization text, code or email then there is nothing to lose. They are nice to have for security however.  
If it is private keys, the thing that you need to be able to retrieve your bitcoin and carry them anywhere, then you will only need that if you send out to a wallet.  
It sound like you plan to keep it on the exchange instead of use a private wallet. This is ill advised as "not your keys not your coins" but if it is a small amount or you are ok with risking whatever amount by keeping them on the exchange then you will not have or need private keys in most cases.  
Your Bitcoin, however, is at the discretion and whim of whatever exchange it is on. Hacks happen and etc. Just know it's a bit riskier kept on the platform.

I agree. Everyone missed the point where it's the only major historical example of a new emerging "asset class" growing in Log form. 
And it was all soon worth nothing.
If I'm a financial advisor and the only other chart on this earth that mirrors bitcoins so well was Tulips, having not a perfect understanding of the tech,I wouldn't reccomend it either.

Thats...  not really how this works. You're using their service. If paxful is a third party entity once they get your bitcoin it's likely sent to a huge withdrawal fund address for the day, hour,minute of withdrawals before transfer to some huge fun or however they do it. Who knows.
They shouldn't let anyone know for security reasons. Either way your assets are just numbers on a screen you have rightful ownership to in legal form. The assets become "truly yours" once withdrawn to a wallet over which you have key control.
Until then anything can happen and they're only sorta your coins and there's definitely no key to give you to a unique wallet containing exactly your amount of asset.

If you're 15 put a large percentage in. I saved ALL my money at 16 all summer. Then I'd have a few thousand bucks and usually piss it away during the school year slowly.   
Odds are most of what you "Spend" will be waste looking back in even just a few years time. Video Games, eating out a lot, etc. The only things that I'm grateful to have bought with some of that summer money is whatever I spend with friends. Going on trips, etc. Outside of that, I wish I woulda put it all into BTC.

That's not even to mention the fact that to "expose"your client to BTC,outside of GBTC, one would just tell your customer "Go make a coinbase account, learn everything you need to know about storage,keys,etc, so you dont lose it all then put 1% of your net worth in and let me know when its done"
Not very great financial advising. Especially assuming they will learn/understand keys.

Admittedly I haven't looked at oscillators or anything, been playing Silver Options lately.
However if you're the redditor who sees this and takes it blindly,try to learn some basic fundamental TA.
It will help infinitely and allow you to double check this mans equation before you even risk money.

No, that I get. Roger's an idiot. Just on the overall argument.  
Hard assets are both the ultimate money and ultimate store of value.  
I've seen so many arguments in r/bitcoin but no where near as bad as in r/CryptoCurrency  
I understand it's because they WANT to hate BTC, so to them stores of value and cash CANNOT be the same thing. Because then BTC would be the indisputable king.  
Well the truth is it can be both. And Bitcoin is indisputable king at the moment for possessing EXACTLY these two unique properties which, by security standard, few or no other blockchains have yet to meet.   
The hardest "Digital Asset" will be that which is most secure. This same asset can obviously be used as payment so long as scaling (L2) provides in the case of BTC.  
But yea BCash is trash. I haven't even bought a single BCH just "In Case". So that's where I stand on BCash lmao  
I'd honestly be more prone to buy a few DASH or something as an "In case it takes off".

Thankfully I feel safe giving them a paper wallet. I don't think either husband owns BTC as they got into crypto in 2017. I know one only owns XRP... poor fucker.  
But the husbands do generally understand keys, wallets and , now that they don't have any, the significance of BTC.  
However it's the type of thing neither wife would let them put money into and I know in the end it will benefit both anyway and our newly forming families. So the Paper wallets should be in safe hands.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:15:57
Yea to be fair I'm only here today after pissing away all my $25 BTC on LSD and the like.  
English Bulldog is fundamentally correct however IF Ross attempted a murder for hire. However, as far as I understand, this is contentious with little evidence outside of Government hear-say. However I may be wrong as I've not read the full fundamental case/evidence in years now. However I remember coming out thinking he likely DIDN'T attempt a murder for hire.  
Yet this is my opinion against what is technically a fact in his case by court standards. So I must relegate that to my opinion as must you as well. It is only fair in the name of justice.  
So all said and told, your opinion should be ASSUMING he was going to have someone murdered even if he did not. And that being the case, all else being equal, I would still support him personally.  
However this is because having been to jail a couple times and having run ins with the law I understand that feeling of paranoia and all prying eyes. I can't even IMAGINE how that feels knowing you're essentially running the world's largest Drug Market outside of the CIA's hands. So he'd likely make some bad paranoid decisions in a not so right state of mind.   
I'm not saying what he did is OK, but having personal experience in his field, running Drug Markets, I can understand how that thought/situation could've came from a total pacifist.   
I started carrying a gun with me to all drug deals the first time I had a gun pulled on me by some skinny white boy twig kid over a $20 gram of weed. And I would've use it if needed to protect myself. Before and after drug dealing I've never owned a gun or had a violent thought really.  
Drugs are a dangerous world. And the danger is your life, whether literally or winding up in prison. When the  thing on the line is literally your life, most men will take another's to save their own. History shows this to be true.  
So I disregard the violence/possible death attempt and look at the fundamentals. Fundamentally he created an open air, peer reviewed, mostly non-violent internet drug market and made it nearly impossible for someone to die off bad drugs.   
All the LSD I ever bought came tried and true, tested by the Justice League, with weeks to months of 5 star reviews and safety tests. To me that is one of the greatest innovations to come from any single man since the War on Drugs started.  
Ironically I'm now so sober I don't even drink caffeine outside of pre-workout. I've battled all my demons and now sobriety, reading and learning are my new highs. But even as a non-drug user I wish the SR was up, running and licensed by government for use.  
It would possibly save the lives of some college kids like me who get robbed at gunpoint over a $20 gram of weed. It's half the reason I used SR so widely. Was tired of putting my life on the line.  
The simple answer, which I found, is clean your act up, enjoy sobriety as intended and as Jordan Peterson says find SOMETHING to be god damn responsible for. But if 7 billion humans did that the world would have no problems. Which will never happen.  
So I ultimately support Ross and wish SR was still up. It's not even worth digging through all the fishy dark net markets these days. SR was tried, true and reliable. Almost every time.  
I stand with Ross. I also thank him for some of the best experiences in my life being delivered via USPS/ Ironically some of those LSD experience are what lead to my sobriety.

As someone who just quit my 11-12hr 6 day a week warehouse job, with no idea what I'm about to do, I say congrats! I put in my 2 weeks on Friday once confronted about the fact my new 8 hours job I JUST got in the warehouse will return me to the same hours suddenly. Have to go help/do my old job AFTER my new job because they "Can't find anyone to hire".
My next move will likely be to part time retail (I come from retail management as  well as machine driving - Home Depot, Furniture warehouse) so I am about to take a HUGE pay cut. But I'm a young single male, with some BTC and Silver stashed away, a nice cash savings for my nearly bill-less single life and I've spent the last 3-6 months teaching myself how to trade stocks and markets in general.
I started making similar to my shit job pay just swing trading on 15 minute breaks. Nothing is guaranteed so I'm gonna take a huge pay cut to hopefully get 2nd shift and have open market hours. I could fail COMPLETELY. But at least I will know I tried and regardless of a LOT of missing guaranteed pay I will no longer be in a soul crushing position where my bosses say "We have a start time, not an end time".
Sometimes you just gotta take risks. Sounds like you were even better prepared than me. And screw everyone naggin you for the pay cut. Any wise and intelligent man can lower his CoL to match is pay if need be. Even if I now only make $1000/month after taxes it's enough for the bills and to put a little away. Plus, I am hoping, I'm finally developed and mature enough I can use my free time to make more money than the $15/hr I was making as a completely cucked wage slave.
Good luck man. Sounds like we're both on a journey.

Just gave him a look... I really like him. Seems to share the same vision as me.
"Don't let temporary greed stop you from buying that .1 BTC (or whatever) you're gonna hold onto for 4 years anyway"  
Edit: Not his quote just my brief summary of our seemingly shared views

Found the smart guy. The best thing for BTC is keeping it out of political discussion and inside cultural/economic discussion.
The government is also really good at fucking up even truly good faith acts.

Ahh yes, I give it about a week to half a decade.

BMO stopped letting me use my DEBIT on Coinbase...
Switched from the family bank to TCF.
TCF is very accomodating about crypto in every way. At least the people at my branch and the bank itself is crypto neutral or friendly.

I bought the majority of my bag at 3.1-3.4k I'm not hurting by any means lmao

To a degree yes. But it was less a financial decision and more of a mental health one. I actually don't believe in my heart that was the full correction. Which is why I still left the majority of my savings in tact. But I thought I had longer to accumulate at the $3400 level as I was so didn't buy enough volume to meet my minimum portfolio threshold.
I planned to have it finished before ANY takeoff, which is my fault. But as someone with anxiety compounding with this market I had to find a happy place where I'm not checking price 24/7 but also open to more investment.
I had a side goal of not paying more than $10k per BTC to meet my portfolio. I'm ok with it for DCA but wanted to finish my portfolio before $10k. I had an opportunity to still do this while only using about 40% of my liquid "I can piss this away in to a risk" cash which seemed like a good enough bet for my mental health.
Literally woke up, saw green, smiled and posted. It was a beautiful feeling to enjoy the green and not be stressed waiting for the red I THINK will happen but cannot guarantee.
I would've full fomoed probably if we tore past $10k though. I'm weak. I needs BTC  
Edit: Also a SilverBug so I piss away money elsewhere too lmao

You can state near facts like DT id a dunce without being an NPC.
Im a libertarian.
To me youre all dunces who keep voting the same way and hoping for change. Democrat or republican, what a joke.
Doesnt make one an NPC to bash the President. Id do the same if Killary was pres. And do mock both sides equally.
The US does manipulate currency markets and DT is, by common sense standard, a dunce in many ways.
Also thought Donald Trump was an idiot well before he ran for president.

Very.. fine reputable sites. Review system was innovative for the product. 10/10 woulda saved the BTC though 7 years later

Honestly this is the most wholesome thing ever.  
ATT accepts BTC through BitPay and the media goes wild. It's all over the place.  
Dark Carver releases a Sci-Fi Ambient Electronic album and accepts real BTC directly (sadly deposited to coinbase, but safer than most exchanges) and he has to come over to r/Bitcoin to make a small announcement.  
I am shortly going to bed so may look into it this weekend I just think this is awesome. And I hope shall I ever start a small business and accept BTC and no one cares that I can come to this Reddit and get at least a couple dozen supporters.  
Good luck Friend!

Seems you've found he right attitude my guy!
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:43:20
Doesn't matter to me now. I've got a solid position and money to buy more if I wish. It can drop to 2.5k for all I care now. I'll buy that dip.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:41:03
That's the nice thing. There's nothing else to FOMO into. I've got enough cash for larger buys if we go down and if not I'm at my minimum threshold outside of DCA weekly.
I'm a happy clam!

He ran for 1 of 2 major parties promising change. 
Likely knowing those parties dont give you the chance to change much of anything.
Gets into power and his whole parties against him til he starts leaning more into their rhetoric.
Doesnt seem smart to me. But other people disagree.
I just wanted to point out bashing the president is super ok, american and doesnt make us all NPCs.

Take my Up Vote for sound advice.
I share many of your same views and already have these safe practices. I'm a BTC fanboy but a realist. Thank you for the input!
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:02:28
Feels good, eh? Haven't honestly checked the price since this. That's sorta the goal though.  
I'm truly HODLING now with my mind elsewhere and a DCA running.

Fair enough mate ;)

You're talking to someone who was buying BTC for $25 in high School and wasting it by... spending it on websites... at 16 years old.  
Anxiety has been a large part of my Bitcoin Journey lmao  
I just refuse to miss out this time. I am also extremely interested in LN and try to use my BTC to pay wherever I can. I just generally hate the Federal Reserve so for me BTC is a beautiful thing.

The irony of this post...
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:47:01
It certainly could be. Doesn't matter to me now. Because I've got my base position set and my recurring buy still goes weekly.
Now I can just sit back and check in occasionally. It was literally just my last  $500 position.
I got almost all of it in then we flew up in April lmao. Been stressing me out when to make this last buy since April. Now it's over. That's all that matters.
I met my minimum threshold. It wasn't my long goal of 1 BTC but I can't really help that now at any rate unless we fall to $3500 for a few months.

The military backing arguement. I love it.
"Well if your country cant afford enough rice and grain at least you can turn in your dollars for US owned and operated tanks"
Thatll feed the population.

I still didn't do too bad though since my DCA was going the whole time while trying to find when to put the "funny money" in
