I got some of that storys too of my friends, but finally it was their fault. Started trading without any knowledge about trading...
Greedy as they are, they put too much money in it initially.

(By the way, I have a car and money already...)

YESS, I do (I'm a girl)
Would be nice if someone of you guys make a flowercoin, so I could get flowers :-)
Think about that....

Switzerland is for sure one of the candidates. We do have our own finance rules, not US or EU or Asia influenced. And opening a business is as easy as anything.

There is no "wrong end". Because it is a huge market where you alwyas can find a buyer.  I just sold during the last huge drop, easy as anything :-)

I can buy flowers with my own money, thanks.
But getting something nice from YOU is a thing, I can't buy ;-)

Really, you dont know what you are talking about, boys :-)

In Switzerland people vote about their taxes. Think about that ?

sorry about you, but I'm more than happy with this professional service. You can not compare cheap stuff with quality service. Oh, you actually can, just keep buying cheap stuff....sry ;-)

Come on.... where are all the guys who bought some bitcoins to get some weed from Silkroad? A news report in the newspaper of the country I live in, about bitcoin and Silkroad, brought my ex to bitcoin, exactly for that reason. He can not be the only one ;-)

That is so true. (sarcasm off)
