Il be curious to see where this goes. Refreshing to see a Bank made for Bitcoin rather than working against it.

i understand that people shorting are only betting that btc will go down in the future but my theory is that it will cause many of the new bitcoin investors (the ones who bought at &gt; $13,000) to cash out fearing loss of assets.
Im not saying it will cause the market to crash or mark the end of bitcoin as every piece of bad news bitcoin has faced has only caused it to dip (at max 30% of the price lost) but as always it bounced back within days.
I think the real question is whether or not there will be another good potential to buy like the time China outlawed bitcoin trades and caused its price to drop 30% over a couple days.

actually were not even at 1% rate of adoption yet, but owing to the amount new coins and ICO's that came out this year, im betting my left testicle that 2018 will be the year of the early adopters.

more reason to look into substratum now. A blockchain project aimed at making the average Joe an ISP  creating a decentralised ISP that no greedy corporate sponge can throttle services for.

as the saying goes, "todays ATH will become tomorrows dip"
i wouldn't stress too much about it at the moment as bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset. 
also lightning network will be implemented soon which should see bitcoin become more of a medium of transaction rather then just a store of wealth
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:57:33
have you heard of substratum? it is pretty much a blockchain based around decentralising the internet where everyone can be an ISP for everyone using the hardware everyone has in their home. It works like mesh networking and I personally believe that this will be a stepping stone towards a decentralised internet.

Bitcoin already reached the moon since it hit $10,000. now it gonna reach the stars.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:28:27
I haven't heard of ZeroNet untill you mentioned but looking into it, it is just as viable of a solution. 
The reason I liked substratum is because it pays users on its network with sub tokens for whoever becomes a web host, acting as some sort of incentive. But then again it was the only one i heard of untill now.

lots of people are buying bitcoin ahead of the bitcoin futures markets introduction
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:27:26
Yes it is the great fool theory which is why BTC has increased by over 800% this year. 
Not because of limited number of BTC supply with an ever decreasing number of new BTC in circulation. 
Not because of the fact that the number of BTC transactions have trippled over the past two years two years and most importanly, BTC's price growth has nothing to do with its adoption as a viable currency (over 100,000 retailers globally accept BTC as payment).
oh yeah and BTC's price crashes has nothing to do with failed attempts at FUD and rigging to get BCH as the primary crypto-currency and im sure we all know that rigging "never" happens in the forex markets.

i was talking about the removal of net neutrality, i dont want it gone either
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:10:30
so in response:
1. I'm suggesting that gold is harder to mine today than it has ever been? Well Duuuhhhhh!!!! Of course I am, wouldn't that explain why gold mining technology is at its best ever like you said. and even then, production has not increased at all in the past two decades with all our advancements in tech as gold is still a finite resource (much like Bitcoin production)
2. Why haven't the largest internet retailers not accept bitcoins?
Have you heard of Microsoft (the largest retailer of software) or Steam (the largest gaming platform) or Paypal (the largest online payment platform) coz they all accept BTC as payment
3. Is comparing fiat currency to Bitcoin relevant? because how is comparing currencies irrelevent?????
so let me elaborate, one has a cap on supply that mimics the creation of gold (as clarified in point 1) and the other used to be based in gold untill our financial institutions changed that asset from gold to debt (because we dont have infinite gold but we can make infinite debt) looking back at 2007 where did a debt based currency get us???
4. Show us an example of a currency traded on the world markts that fell by 30% in one day or one that rose 2,700% in three years? Simple explanation, they don't. Why? Because they are all rigged on a regular basis. my point earlier was on bitcoins ability to recover from a rigging exercise (in this case it was a pump and dump). in 2015 GBP-EUR price fell from 1.4 to 1.3 and didn't recover until October and that was only a 7% drop. Whereas Bitcoin, yes it lost 30% of its value in one day but within 3 days it recovered its value back and within a week, it felt like nothing happened. That is why BTC is resistant to market rigging. hell even Silver and Gold are heavily rigged to keep the price low by the fact we trade over 1000x more virtual gold then there is physical gold in existence. A problem bitcoin completely negates. 
Now stop being salty about your failure to invest as it is still not too late ;)
also by your logic of BTC having no asset behind them, i guess you can also argue that All Fiat currencies are bubbles as they don't have a solid asset behind them, just that we trust them to be valuable.

It looks like the Bcash supporters (and possibly Rodger Vers minions) on r/btc are trying to flag all 1* reviews of bitcoin.com as spam
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:21
It would hinder bitcoins growth and even cause it to dip in price as there will be nothing stopping your ISP's from throttling access to bitcoin related web service like exchanges, hotwallets and transactions. Yes you could us a VPN or Tor but how many tech newbies know how to use VPNs or Tor?
will this repeal kill bitcoins? NO because we have seen more punishing legislation in the past with other nations like China that had more bitcoins flowing every hour then everywhere else in the world had combined. 
Did china criminalising bitcoin destroy it? again nope, people just saw its dip as a good time to by "discounted bitcoins" but it still did cause a major price drop of 40%.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:19:43
In theory, it could cause the price to drop a bit (not devastatingly much but a noticeable amount) over the course of a couple months as people in the US will have a harder time using BTC in exchanges or accessing their hot wallets. Luckily America is not the only (or largest) adopter of BTC so it will recover. Just that Net Neutrality will cause it to suffer a bit
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:01:49
I don't know. If there is one thing that the Obama Administration and the Trump Administration have in common is the fact that they both opposed bitcoin but at the same time couldn't legally let it stop.
As american ISP's have secretly slowed down many web services like torrentz secretly in the past with net neutrality in place,  wouldn't they take advantage of the situation to slow down access to web based wallets and exchanges to put new people off investing?
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:31:54
if you cant use or trade bitcoin it loses its core utility. it doesnt become scarce, it becomes a less viable option with higher fees to make payments. therfore it will lose its value
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:25:41
depends on how much you are trying to sell. if you are trying to seel under £2000, from my experience using a verified local bitcoins seller will be sufficient as long as you sell to another verified account as they would have to go through ID and bank authorisation. If you want an added layer of security, you could make a sell bitcoin ad with the request of ID verification (and optionally a piece of paper stating that "**this guy** is buying bitcoins from **you**". It will take longer but you will have more security when selling bitcoin. 
Another thing you might want to look into is Natwest as they have never been friendly towards people using bitcoins and my brother was accused of money laundering as a result of it. 
Alternatively I started to use wirex as their exchange rates are pretty much the same as the average on local bitcoins  (there is allways cryptopay and xapo too). I have never had any issues with it personally (but i can only speak for my self) and found it a bit more user friendly when cashing in or out of bitcoins as they have their own exchange on their website.

Cheers for the insight, So does having a prepaid card work like owning a bank account? do you not keep your private keys?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:58:16
Couldn't that be seen as another transaction fee to send bitcoins across? also, Couldn't your ISP slow down access to your internet wallet or exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:44:52
why is that stuff bullshit in your opinion?  
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:37:44
It definitely wont cause the price to increase. If anything it could cause the price to drop as access to bitcoin exchanges and hot wallets could be throttled making btc a less viable means of trade. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:12:13
more like decrease the value if american buyers users cant use or buy BTC because their online wallet and exchanges have their bandwidth capped

I don't trust most governments either as their purpose is meant to work for the people of its nation and not for private corporations who's only interest is to maximise profits. However, from my viewpoint this looks like an attempt by the FCC to work in favour of big corporations as it will allow them to charge their users based on how much they want to use a certain web service. Plus when the Free market only consists of Verizon and Comcast, would you trust the internet in their hands after their business practices in the past or would you rather it in the hands of your elected official who in theory was voted in to work for your best interests?

In the pizza guys defence, If everyone held their coins and never sold/spent it, it would have never been able to grow as high as it is. 
Therefore people like the Pizza guy are the unsung heroes of the Bitcoin community.

when most bitcoins flow into the US at the moment, Bitcoin will be the most affected Crypto-currency (that and Bcash)
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:58:07
I agree, i would rather trade just for the asset and not have to pay any additional fees. But i have bought some items myself using BTC (mostly just on Steam) just for proof of concept and it works, unlikes gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:03:32
well i would love another opportunity to invest in more bitcoins if that was to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:31:29
Wow, someones clearly salty that they didn't invest in Bitcoin earlier.
As clearly stated in my post, the number of transactions per year is just one of many factors driving up the BTC price. As you have clearly not done/refuse to do a second of research so let me clarify once again.
 
1. the reason why the generation of BTC is called mining because the creation of BTC is heavily modelled after the generation of gold i.e. the more gold extracted, the harder to extract future gold therefore, more investment needed to extract future gold.
 
2. greater market adoption with over 100,000 reatilers globally now accepting bitcoin 
3. compared to our fiat currency, it costs next to nothing to print hundreds of bank notes but it costs hundreds if not thousands to create bitcoins through mining. 
4. as we have seen last week, BTC is far less prone to market rigging than Fiat currencies by the fact that within a week it managed to sustain a price rigging attack and stabilised. whenever this happens on the FOREX markets, recovery can take weeks if not months. 
I hope this helps but now you do some research yourself and please stop talking out your arse.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:49:27
Thats concerning, I don't think people are anywhere near as worried about it as they should be.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:06:26
even though you overpaid in transaction fees, your point still stands that it is still far cheaper and faster to send $2000 for $2 then if you where to wire money internationally with a company like western union who could charge you up to 10%. personally i would rather get $1998 than $1800
