I owned Bitcoin until I realized the community was against anything beyond a store of value, I hold Ether. I was considering rebuying BCH but this pump is too much, gonna wait for dust to settle and then I might buy some of it.

Yes it is much worse today due to slowed block times and spamming, true, but on a normal day fees are still high and blocks are still full. 
A 2MB block is a very meager change, and even with Segwit and lightning it should be implemented. From how things appear it seems core has no desire for larger blocks.

You are correct, I prefer BCH to BTC, but believe it or not I own neither.

Only allowed when it's making strawmans and falsely calling a serious competitor to Btc a scam. This sub cares more about their wallet growing then acknowledging emerging tech.

Now might not be a bad time, months of consolidation at $290-320 now and there are a lot of developers working to grow the system. The growing split in Btc community might create a nice opportunity for an Ethereum pump.

So having a block size other than 1MB makes Bitcoin not Bitcoin? I must have missed that when I read the white paper.

That's a guy who sold his BCH.

"Price doesn't matter" oh wait bch is turning down "price matters!!"

No, store of value, this is good for Bitcoin. In fact we should decrease block size to 64kB to solve this.

Yea fuck those people for buying into a blockchain that can send transactions with $0.01 fees, they should have bought BTC so they can spend $5 in fees and wait 10 hours. /s
Everybody has a bias but at the end of the day BCH is working, you can send transactions on it, and it's beautiful. A good investment strategy is to invest in something you would use yourself, and I know which one I would prefer to use.

I've yet to see this often repeated claim here be substantiated. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:59:54
I actually agree. This is what I like about Ethereum as tokens can be built on it which are far more stable because they are backed by something.

These all still require some transacting on chain using the space of the blocks though, from the lightning website: "Two participants create a ledger entry on the blockchain".
Also these solutions are not well supported or not here yet, and the Bitcoin network at the present is suffering.
Why 1MB? Why not 2MB or 512KB? It is not arbitrary, and right now users are suffering massively in fees due to a poorly chosen block size for the level of transacting the Bitcoin network sees.

GDAX is Coinbase's exchange, you can instantly transfer your Bitcoin to there and setup a limit sell order which will incur no fees.
