You have not blocked port 8333 on your router!

Vmware is usually used on the local LAN and user don't need to connect to peers world wide - only client - server connections.

How you going to connect to the network in the first place when the rest of the network is still on port 8333 and your ISP blocked that port!?

How would you receive and transmit radio on your computer? Assuming you can afford buying these expensive and bulky equipment doesn't radio exposes you to detection and locating you (by signal strength or triangulation ) for violating the law? Did you actually think this through or are you just making stuff up?

No it's not impossible. They can filter network traffic and block port 8333. And if you are caught, they can throw you in jail.

Countries have already banned bitcoin:
* Thailand - The Thai treasure banned bitcoin outright.
* China - The Chinese treasure enacted policies on bitcoin that pretty much restricted the use of the virtual currency.
* Taiwan – The country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) blocked efforts to install Bitcoin ATMs in the country and restricted its use as an alternate currency.
* India – The Indian’s central bank published a lengthly document against the use of bitcoin. If the country is not accepted by the central banking system, it’s pretty much useless.
* Germany – The German government and central bank Bundesbank formally accepted bitcoin as a private virtual currency but not as a public currency.
* Bolivia – The developing country claims bitcoin was created by the United States government to wage financial warfare on other countries!
* Russia – The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office says ”Systems for anonymous payments and cyber currencies that have gained considerable circulation — including the most well-known, Bitcoin — are money substitutes and cannot be used by individuals or legal entities.”

That just proves it is extremely VOLATILE. Now we know consumers will never touch it.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:34:55
Then what's the point of having so many different ports? Why not just use one port for everything?
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:30:23
Really? You don't know about packet sniffing and filtering or networks. When everybody in the world is on port 8333 and you change YOUR port you cannot connect to peers. Remember your ISP has blocked port 8333! It's being already done. Authoritarian regimes are doing it already.
And what exactly are you going to do when they arrest you and throw you in jail?
Looks like it is you who don't have education in Networks.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:32:23
Everybody on the network must use the same port or they cannot connect to peers.

A resourceful entity such as governments, N. Korea, China, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:26:54
That can't be true or you wouldn't need to be on port 8333 in the first place. Peers "listen" on port 8333.
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:03:17
Yes but doesn't every user in the world have to be on the same port? If you use HTTPS then nobody will do it because now the users can't access normal https webpages.
@_date: 2015-06-26 23:27:48
Try testing that. Change your wallet port and see if you can connect to the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:16:08
The video did not address these questions. My understand is that for peers to connect they need to "listen" on a port for TCP or UDP packets. If you have bitcoin client listening on port 8333 but others using another port. Packets received on the wrong port will not be acknowledged. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:47:38
Do you have a link?
@_date: 2015-06-26 23:25:24
I know you can use work-arounds or you can use radio. That's not the issue. The problem if people have to go through this much headache, they will not use it - they will use an alternative cryptocurrency that is not blocked or simply use whatever they have been using. Moreover, such major obstacles will cause a massive crash in the price.
One way to test this is to try it yourself. Change your wallet port to 80 and see what happens. You will not be able to connect to peers.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:03:38
That's not feasible or realistic. The payee must have internet connection and how mining or confirmations can occur without exposing your radio source signal? Even so, if people have to do that, the price of BTC will crash to near zero if not zero.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:18:42
If everybody who got involved for the wrong reasons ie get rich quick, and sell BTC as you suggest, the price will plummet to near $0 and probably nobody will ever touch it again.
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:30:53
Sorry, your statement is blatantly false: BTC price bubble burst and lost over 50% from over $1000 to less than $500. What planet are you from?
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:55:46
Not even Doge will make it mainstream.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:40:39
I believe there will also be more competition from Facebook (Payment system) as well.

It had hovered around $800 for a while before the breakdown started! Now that it is hovering around 450 seams to be a cycle that's going to repeat. It's amazing how these cycles look very patterned. Unfortunately, it's all trending down.
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:45:42
What value? The price of BTC is extremely volatile and plummeting making the "value" argument delusional at best.
Look, Satoshi's bitcoin social experiment was a romantic idea. Unfortunately, it's not working out because consumers can't spend what they don't have and it's no longer decentralized rather controlled by the ASIC and foundation cartel.
There is simply no incentive for consumers to give up their fiat. Most of them pay digitally by credit card. If your business does not accept credit card, your customers will shop elsewhere that accepts credit cards. It's that simple!

Don't get too excited. Those who get involved with Bitcoin are either taking it for a test drive or speculating. I was a huge fan of Bitcoin but gave up on it because I realized that it's not much more than hype. For the average person, it offers absolutely nothing! There is nothing Bitcoin can do that any other digital currency or electronic payment system cannot do. Don't tell me about fees and access to banking, remittance and all the other nonsense that does not mean much to the mainstream consumer. 
Sorry for the rant, but I have been studying Bitcoin and altcoins for the last year and my conclusion is consistent with the experts who are not optimistic.
@_date: 2014-10-01 06:29:51
Tell him that he will need a specialized accountant to file his taxes for any bitcoin revenue but customers don't have bitcoins to begin with.
