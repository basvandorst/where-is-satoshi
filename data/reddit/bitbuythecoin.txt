What would you do now? You wouldn’t be able to use your Visa card. You’d have to have cash.

If we are talking more then your basic outage emp type situation then yeah cash is worthless. Three things are paramount to trade with——Smokes, booze, and bullets.

With each new article I read I also get more excited for this technology. I remember the moment I realized that it only about creating money. That is an important part especially since the fed is one big money launderer. But it's about the chain. It's the underlining code behind the money that is so important. I absolutely love reading anything I can on the subject. I don't always understand everything but that just keeps me looking up new things.

Now THIS is cool. How do we invest in this technology?

Do we get coin like we did with BCC?

I would love too! Need funds! I'm working on it ;)

Ok. I get it now. It takes out BTC and S2X. Then exchanges S2X into BTC but never puts the original BTC back that it erroneously took out.  So it stays at the exchange.  Thank you for clarification.

I posed this question earlier today haven’t seen an answer yet. Maybe you can answer:
This may be a naive question but if there is no replay and you exchange B2X for BTC is the BTC really in danger? It seems like a closed circle. I can understand the risk to exchange to something else such as ETH or whatever.
