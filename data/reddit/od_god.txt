If he has a Ledger there is a possibility that he has more bitcoin than 1500 dollars worth. I would check his search history and see if he uses any exchanges such as Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance, etc... At that point you would probably need some type of proof to provide the exchange but it will probably take a long time to go through that process.

A whole 15 dollars? Wow.

It's just in bad taste. As an artist it would be extremely disheartening to shrug my artwork off as someone elses. Especially Banksy, dude is overrated as fuck.

He has SOME merit. As full time working artist who understands the gravity of technique when it comes to painting and charcoal. There are far greater artist in the world the banksy. My original statement is that he is over rated. 
And when it comes to profound you can find it in the great masters work which lies within the strokes of every painting that they have spent 1000s of hours mixing their own colors from stones they have found in the earth, giving them a strong connection with color itself. Banksy throws it right in your face “Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.” ... fuckin cheap if you ask me. Only someone with an untrained eye in art would find that profound.

Look up “Blek le rat” banksy completely copied his style. Is whole image is a rip off. Originality comes from the repetitions that an artist has put in. Refining and refining until your technique is perfect and the refining some more. The is where real beauty lies wether it be painting or being a wine maker.  People think artist just have a gift but they’re wrong. Become an artist and you will understand the best artist are the ones who work the hardest and focus the hardest. It’s like anything else.

Lol. Ok. Just because you can cut out a stencil with some profound statement, and have "street art" gallery that sells pieces for a million dollars doesn't mean shit. Their are many higher tier artist that spend tens and thousands of hours perfecting their craft and Banksy throws up a couple stencils that his team of people probably put up for him and everyone goes crazy. He's a bullshit artist and your buying it.

I understand the hallmark card quote completely. It’s cheap it doesn’t have depth.  There is no substance behind it. I could have google searched that.

Banksy isn't this good.
