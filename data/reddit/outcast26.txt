And ignore that some guy lost a lot of money because of your advice. How nice. As long as you profit, right?

People selling is causing the decline. Did you somehow think people only buy? Can you give me one reason why the price should go up right now?
Who the hell is downvoting all my posts? Why ffs??

And as usual none of this will have any effect on bitcoin. Nobody is suddenly gonna switch to Bitcoin because of this.

People selling coins. 
You seem surprised that the price just doesn't go up and up. You didn't really expect that, did you?
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:48:15
You presented it as a fact. You have to be careful with these "facts" when other people their money is involved. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:49:26
When was the last time it went up because of big news? 3 years ago?
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:59:01
The price went up because of the halvening hype. Now that the hype is over it goes back down. 
I keep seeing these posts where people are totally confused how the price possibly could go down. Seriously, what do you people expect? That it just keeps going up for no reason?
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:06:52
And it drops to 400 next week? Will you come back here and apologize to the guy or just "forget" you made that comment?
So many people lost money by listening to useless advice in this sub.

Something tells me you are clueless about building an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 13:41:35
Fiat obviously. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:57:15
The halvening was news??
Edit: did you downvote my comment??
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:17:38
Nobody knows. It could go to 100 tomorrow or to 1000. Also there is absolutely no way of knowing if Bitcoin will be huge in the future. Not sure where you got that idea from. And asking random people in a Bitcoin sub what to do with your money is a very bad start. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:01:48
Not sure if trolling. 


@_date: 2016-08-01 13:42:03
And why would Bitcoin be at 3000 next year?
@_date: 2016-08-01 15:27:42
Your crystal ball told you what will happen 20 years from now?
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:47:51
How does this not end up in your spam folder. I never get any of those mails. Like really never.

Thanks for posting all the details so we can help you better. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:43:09
So everyone again has to give up their privacy because 1 or 2 terrorists might use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 04:38:31
Why did you post this here?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:38:39
Because someone decided to sell a few 1000 coins. 
There is so much nonsense in this thread. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:33:07


I love Bitcoin as much as anyone here but this statement is ridiculous and even if it was their only option it won't happen anyway.
