Same thing happened to me as well. I submitted a sell QRK to BTC sell order and it immediately disappeared.

I've lost many thousands the past few days due to Bitcoin scams and foolish trades, but am really humbled by this. I was a relatively early adopter as well (mid 2011) and I always wondered what my life would've been like if I had just kept my 1000 btc rather than continuously selling them. There really is no good in pondering these shoulda, woulda, couldas.
Besides the potential profits, at least you did not lose anything. OP, if you still lived a good life since then, another 100k should not change that. I wish you the best in your future investments!

Cryptsy did have some problems in which people were able to withdraw bitcoins that they did not have in their accounts. I tried to submit a trade couple days ago and my funds disappeared.
I've been using BTC-e for about a year now and never had problems. However, we can never know for certain what will happen to them in the future.

I recently got scammed out of a fair amount of coins and posted on this subreddit only to warm others, not to ask for sympathy tips. The rise of Bitcoin definitely opened up a lot of scamming opportunities due to its relatively anonymous nature.
There certainly are escrow services for bitcoin transactions. I heard good things about BTCrow and John K. As much as I love Bitcoin, the lack of buyer protection is what I hope to see improved in the future.

Another thing: Bitcoin = money = a material object. Please do not let greed compromise your good character.
During my state of fury I thought about tossing everything I have into satoshi dice and hoping to double up haha. Then I figured, if it's THAT easy to scam vulnerable people, why not do the same and get my money back and then some?
That's not who I am and I will never succumb to that level because of Bitcoin. Let's not let the few bad apples ruin this revolutionary idea, but nevertheless, BE CAREFUL.

It seems like they fixed the issue. I have the original amount of Quark showing on my account, so the trade did not go through. Kind of a blessing in disguise because the QRK/BTC ratio is a bit higher :)
