I used to be a fan, until someone pointed out that it sends be entire browsing history to McAffee. No thanks

Gotta say, the website could sure do with a map. I live in Portland and had to Google each of the locations. Some of the URLs go to Facespace, and there are no descriptions. I'm in no way a web designer and in fact have a horrible sense of web design, but that's just my two cents, cool project tho.
EDIT: Oh jebus please clean up your HTML! It doesn't even have an `&lt;html&gt;` tag, not to mention a doctype

1. OP's wife works at a restaurant.
2. OP's wife's coworker stole OP's wife's tips
3. Same coworker had sexual intercourse with the boss, so the boss didn't care.

[Link]( for those interested.

Alright, I've seen a lot of links on reddit that hit this and there's no imgur mirror, so i mirrored it just in case.
@_date: 2012-09-16 22:32:51
meh. That makes it possibly even more sketchy. Tor is not the way to make yourself seem credible. I guess a mirror would be OK...
@_date: 2012-01-03 04:16:32
@_date: 2012-10-06 01:24:14
[Mirror]( for when your dropbox link hit's it's cap. Also the word imgur for people who ctrl-f for that instead.
@_date: 2012-09-16 18:11:00
Looks cool. Please please please tell him get a dot com. Or pretty much any tld other than dot tk. They're really cheap and make your site look *much* less sketch.
@_date: 2011-08-04 04:53:44
What sites? lets hear your ideas. I'd be willing to donate some time. (if they sound good)
@_date: 2011-08-13 17:55:20
I doubt the admins would need to be sold on that, but Conde Naste might.
@_date: 2011-08-05 02:40:09
cool. Yeah i'm at Defcon this weekend, won't have time to do anything anyway
@_date: 2011-07-13 20:27:32
1. [Make a new account]( on his site
2. Repeat step 1 several times, using tor, proxies, etc
3. Make the place undesirable.
4. ??????
5. PROFIT!

Well [OP said it was in Magnolia]( and from looking [the video OP posted]( it looks like it's on a long street name started with a G, so my girlfriend and I looked at Google Maps and the only possibility that was super obvious was Government Way. So through use of Google Maps we figured out 2 places that the street looks like that, and only one of them had the proper placement of stop sign and utility pole and such. So I called my friend who lives in Mag and sent him off to go get it. Looks like it was taken just a few minutes before
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:18:23
Wasn't there as of 5 minutes ago. (assuming 35th and Government Way in Magnolia, Seattle. 2 thumbtacks there though)
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:00:17
Several people have discussed doing that. There's the [Roaming Initiative]( and a post every now and then on from someone who thinks the idea is so original that they've gone and drawn up another plan for doing it. Definitely gonna happen some day, but there needs to be a bit of infrastructure first.

They could really do with an installer/proper packaging. Looks like the guide for every OS is "install python, install these python dependencies, then (from the command line/terminal), execute `python electrum.py`" It doesn't add menu entries or anything.
@_date: 2013-05-24 02:30:37
Not my decision. The software we're using (cjdns) has their main channel on EFnet, and a lot of the people involved have issues with how Freenode is run.
@_date: 2013-05-24 00:47:45
Email support and we'll get you squared away. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:26:37
Damn, the style hasn't changed in 12 years?
@_date: 2013-02-06 21:07:19
Cool. What about the other stuff? Do you partner with them or what?
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:53:05
I used to have a bot that would IRC conversations between EFnet, Freenode and this other network we were using, but then we kinda ditched the other network and no one came on from Freenode so i shut it down. If there's interest I could start it back up again with just EFNet and Freenode, maybe Snoonet. I'm in ` on Freenode.

Of course! Pretty sure that's why this has was posted here. On [the checkout page]( you're given the option for credit cards vs bitcoins. We've already received just over 2 BTC.
EDIT: now at 10 BTC, we've received about 1.5 times as much in BTC as in USD via Stripe at this point. Also removed our address from this comment. It was pointed out that you shouldn't trust random addresses people post.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:25:56
Well we're going to keep working on that, perhaps once we get most of the automation crap dealt with we can set it up to be easy to drop into other places
@_date: 2013-02-06 21:20:47
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:07:53
holy shit thanks &lt;3
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:08:40
Actually, talk to Not sure how that's still going but they're the group that's trying to monetize the mesh. They're mostly waiting for the software to mature more so they can add their money stuff. And I presume they'll use Bitcoins or something
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:23:06
Oh now it's okay to link to gawker?
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:14:53
We started off with that, then it turned out that it was incredibly confusing so we borrowed a bit of their design and made our own. Currently it's a static HTML page which we're updating as we get more, but we're working to make it automatically integrate with BTC and Stripe. [Here]( the git repo for it.
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:56:37
No idea. I'll see if I can get someone from IRC who knows more about it over here
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:29:32
Oh yeah sorry forgot to mention! email support and they'll get you hooked up
@_date: 2013-02-06 20:56:44
Hey so could you walk me through how it works? Like, do you partner with the carrier or is there some sort of API type thing for paying a bill that like a shitload of carriers just happen to support? Why doesn't it work for contract phones? Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:00:40
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:59:04
AVs aren't perfect.
@_date: 2013-05-24 02:17:12
First, thank you for not calling it &lt;3
We're a group of people working to establish a decentralized, secure, global mesh network. More info at projectmeshnet.org or ` on EFnet (if that doesn't make sense just click [this](
@_date: 2013-05-24 04:17:21
But this works with credit cards too (although we have received a majority of our donations via bitcoins at this point in time). Additionally this doesn't cost a 5% fee. It's like 3% or 4% for credit cards, and no fee for bitcoins (well there are miner fees and such, but we don't pay those)
@_date: 2013-09-02 19:35:04
Wait you're supposed to click something? Fuck. That is dumb
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:58:28
It's been taking off for a while, we just haven't needed money until recently. Mostly software stuff up until now
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:24:56
Good point, I'll bring it up with the group, see what everyone thinks
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:33:55
Correction: Project Meshnet. We don't like to be called because it sounds like we're setting up a darknet or something, which of course we're not. Also I'm happy to answer questions
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:27:41
It's just the default client that a lot of people use, Bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:00:28
@_date: 2013-01-12 08:51:02
So post that too!
