edit: you guys definitely have a point, it could simply be transaction count increasing... [this graph]( does show an increase in transactions since a couple days ago, and looking at it now the transaction count is indeed at unprecedented levels. [the super even &amp; regular climb up to this mempool size]( and how it's now staying at that level seems suspicious to me still, but i have nothing other than a gut feeling to back that up. perhaps the shelf at 220000 txns in mempool indicates the cost of these transactions is the new equilibrium, in essense working as intended.
It looks like perhaps the network is under attack again. The number of transactions in the mempool grew to huge numbers over the past couple of days. I'll bet the price being so high made it profitable to spam transactions, making the fee price rise something like 3x what it was a week ago and increasing mining profitability.

It looks like it says this message originated from Yahoo, which doesn't sound like Binance. hard to tell, the image you posted is super blurry. If it was indeed from Yahoo, either your funds got stolen or binance is actually doing you a huge favor by locking phishers out of your account. this sounds like you got taken advantage of. you should never keep more bitcoin than youcanafford to lose in an exchange.

Sure, following a trail will be difficult, but the dust transactions aren't even trying to follow a particular person - they're just spamming known addresses, of which the block chain is the ultimate source, the reference ledger.

Encrypt your backups with trusted software, and then you should be fine storing your backups in dropbox or something. In Windows, there used to be truecrypt, not sure what to recommend there anymore; in Linux you can use LUKS to create a loopback device in a file and store your backups there.
Additionally most wallets these days support a feature called a "seed" value - you can record a couple of words on paper and use it to "reconstitute" your wallet in the event of loss or failure. I'd almost recommend doing that more - put that piece of paper in a fire safe and call it a day.

I guess I'm just wary of storing important data on unmaintained software. At some point i would expect it to become inconvenient or difficult to use on more recent OSes. I'm not a windows guy though. I mostly just wanted to couch that recommendation cuz I'm not sure what to recommend in windows land. If that's still truecrypt, I'm glad I wasn't far off base haha

as an aside, the RAM considerations are more than I would have expected, except for the fact that it's managing a large DB (otherwise known as the blockchain); do not underestimate the amount of RAM this will use. On a machine with 1GB of ram &amp; 2GB of swap, my (admittedly high traffic) node always invited the OOM killer to be invoked after a couple of hours of use. the host I was using was digital ocean.

so no, these were not sent all with one transaction. [it does however look like all of this came from one wallet]( where there were about 50 paper wallets created from .1BTC, sparing a bit for OPs badass self.
what's more interesting is the address where this original seed wallet came from - it's given to this address twice on the 23rd ([1]( [2]( and if I'm reading into the mixing of the coins correctly the owner probably possesses between 3 &amp; 5 BTC total.  
edit: there are 46 wallets in the picture
edit edit: I cannot possibly backup the statement 'between 3 &amp; 5 BTC total' - that's what it looks like from the mixing that bitcoind does, but if there are multiple wallets in question my analysis falls flat on its face. would love more information on this sort of analysis
