I've spent time in another openly communist government, and I'm perfectly aware how people circumvent the law. Are you telling me that private regulators have no bars in starting a new firm without bribe in China? Are you telling me that to start a new business all I need is a compelling product and no intervention with the authorities? Are you telling me that I can start any public service in China, like a political satire or Islamic evangelism, only subject to my own discretion without influence or permission from the government?
You know about China, but very little about Libertarianism. You think Libertarian equates to unregulated dystopia. You think libertarian means "buy anything, who cares". It shows that you have no clue about what you are talking about.

The spirit of what democracy wishes to achieve is absolutely great: the masses would get exactly what they want, without succumbing to a ruler. 'Democracy' as a system fails to achieve this, because it comes packaged with representative decision making processes and binary decisions (like elections for chief representative ruler) decided by a majority, that then become the law of the land. In theory, the 51% could oppress the 49%. This, in my opinion too, has been a failure, historically speaking. 
I, and many others, believe that markets are more democratic (in its true spirit) than a democratic government. There is a school of thought in economics that talks about peaceful market anarchy, and private property in a stateless society. I personally believe that this is the inevitable future of mankind, but thats besides the point.
