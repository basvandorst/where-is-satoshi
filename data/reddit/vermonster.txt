I have been trying but I have been having problems verifying my bank account. I guess I will have to call them. Or am I maybe just doing something stupid in dwolla?

Is it safe to store all your cash there I mean haven't there been a few hacks and stuff?

No activity from them on my bank account yet but I did redo it so they said they could be as much as 72 hours so I guess I could have 48 more hours before I contact my bank and find out about it.

Just getting dwolla to authorize my bank. I did it before and waited like a week and didn't see anything in my bank account like their message told me to do to authorize it. So I just deleted my bank and re added it so I will see on wed or thursday and if it doesn't work Ill just try authorizing it at my bank branch. So you pretty much put money in the dwolla account and transfer to something like mt gox to then trade for bitcoins?

A few weeks ago. I am thinking I might be to far down on the list to make it profitable. So I might just cancel

I ordered from them today and it took me 2.5 hours to get the coins.

Yeah, I have seen the figures with march being the time which they will deliver but is it worth it? I can wait until then.
