So, lots of errors in your statement.
1) Speculation does not equate to a bubble. Speculation is a natural element to commodity valuation. Simply what a buyer and seller are willing to pay. Bitcoin hasn't even broken its 50 day moving average.
2)You're partially right, but equities aren't valued on profits but on earnings, price to earnings (P/E), or discounted cash flow. Many companies do not even book profits but have negative earnings and still carry lofty valuations aka Tesla. Valuation all comes down to expectations. 
3) You're Bitcoin to Apple comparison is flawed. If people lose faith in a firm they are just as susceptible to being eliminated from the market. 
4) If Bitcoin Core became defunct it would bring a collapse to all cryptocurrencies. They all trade in correlation to its performance and the faith of the whole crypto movement is dependent on its success.

technically correct, except you're not selling first, you're borrowing someone elses shares (brokerage) they sell it on your behalf, and if you are successful you buy back at a lower price, and you keep the difference.

You can't buy a Lambo for 75k.

Just a recommendation, when you're using time frames and SMA's as intraday reference points, you want to use common time frames that other traders are using, i.e 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30min, and 1hr. If you want the overall trend for a day you'd use the 1hr.
