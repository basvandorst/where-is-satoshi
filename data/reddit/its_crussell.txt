Dollar cost averaging is a very smart investing technique, especially if you realize how valuable Bitcoins are as a long term investment

The dangers of swapping hi and low bets on martingale. Absolutely devastating loss-steaks. Then again, it can always go in the opposite direction ;)

Seriously? Buddy, look at the litecoin price. It is now bitcoin's little brother and investors all over are hopping on board. Its silly to only hold bitcoins in your portfolio as alternative cryptos hold great potential for ROI.

It's never too late to start investing guys. Seriously, this is still just the beginning. I expect price to break $1000 by 2015.

Look at a logarithmic graph of Bitcoin growth. It's a certainty that they'll hit $1000 eventually. The only question is when. I'm being bullish on my speculation of &lt;2 years, but to each his own. 
Just remember that the market always catches up to fundamentals. Bitcoin is here to stay.
