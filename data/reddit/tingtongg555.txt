Remove the hard drive, go-to the store and get an external hard drive caddy that converts your internal hard drive type IDE? Possibly SATA HDD into an external unit. This will help you solve the power source issue. If you run into issues when plugging in via USB then it could be a master/slave jumper setting which would be a easy configuration that the manual within your Hard Drive caddy should help resolve :) Then take that Bitcoin and Convert it into Stellar Lumen before BTC tanks from Futures margin crisis. Stellar to 10$...16 cents ATM so get on it!!! Be careful with the exchanges. Be selective. And research withdrawal support ticket inquiries via what people are saying on Twitter on those specifics exchanges you may be interested in before deposit/withdraw transaction

I would not keep them anywhere but on the tokens network and paper wallet. No wallet no exchange.

How about just but alts with the Bitcoin and stay out of Bitcoin all together due to the vunerabilities of segwit2x. Jump in alts that are only going to rocket once Bitcoin tanks. Why risk coinbase with their bad reputation. On the last fork not giving anyone their Bitcoin cash. Don't take risks and don't trust entities that aren't regulated just yet. Coinbase went international recently.

Wait until after Nov 15th. It'll be cheaper

Don't be investing in Bitcoin cause you open yourself up to vunerabilities. Look at etherium, they just got 300million stuck unable to access anything. Just wait on bitcoin..invest in xlm or xrp. Make some money then after the fork take a small percentage of your profits and gradually invest in Bitcoin while it's at it's low.  It'll never be bigger than what takes its place as standard but it will be worth alot potentially if it ever makes a comeback lol. The upcoming fork might make the coin a rarity.

Develop a site using a Stellar.org Lumens wallet. Processing fees are a fraction of a fraction and take less than 5 seconds. They are and will be the payment rail for the way money moves. Good job with everything!! Message me if you need info or help. Gracias
