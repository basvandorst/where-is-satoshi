Is this really what we wanted bitcoin to be? We could have had it all, and now it's just some speculator's tool about how useful digital gold is, when there is digital gold that also happens to be liquid like cash. Bitcoin was "Be your own bank" and its changed into "bitcoin is like a bank, charge you high fees, and make it slow to access your money unless you use our special service." It makes me sick, because I really thought it was resilient and unsubvertable. I wonder how many people who hold bitcoin have actually read the whitepaper cover to cover?

The fallacy is that if you do find it in that one minute, you aren't doing very much work, and you use very little resources for that reward. This means that if transactions are evenly spaced, and you have your machine on continuously, the amount of work you do for each block is directly proportional to the reward. If less people are searching for it in the first seconds, your odds of getting beaten to the punch go down, and so you will get young blocks more often than the people who don't get them at all. That means that they may have saved 1 watt of electricity, but lost out on a potential 0.2 btc.

I think Bitcoin _SHOULD_ be at the top of that list.

Only if the amount of bit coins per joule drops to about the price of a joule. 
@_date: 2012-12-13 09:42:08
Also, by that point potentially hundreds of transactions would be happening every minute, so even if the reward is 1/10 of the normal reward 1 minute after a block is found, people will still want to claim that reward, so they will mine from the time the block is created until it is found. To wait otherwise you may miss out on that money, and disadvantage yourself.

So does anyone know of any two numbers that share a hash? Or would the computational power and memory space required be too great to make this remotely plausible to know?
@_date: 2012-12-13 10:22:08
So if I was hashing random numbers, trying to find a particular hash, and succeeded in finding it, would it be more likely that I found the original number, or a collision?
@_date: 2012-12-01 15:39:11
@_date: 2012-12-13 10:58:58
But as I pointed out, it's different because the investment of hashing power is worth the reward you might potentially get. If I skip the first minute of each block, how much electricity do I save? Is the price of that worth the bitcoins I potentially miss out on?
@_date: 2012-12-28 23:02:46

Why would the US ban bitcoin, money laundering? They've already shown their true colors on where they stand with that, they simply don't care. They chose not to prosecute a number of people within banks who did that.

I am 21 years old, an adult in every lawful sense. Ever since I can remember my family had a computer. I was six years old and typing commands into a DOS terminal. I have never known a world before the internet. Throughout high school, smart phones were coming into being, and information was literally at your fingertips with wifi and laptops. I believe I am the essence of what it means to be in generation Y, at least on the technical side. Really, the defining characteristics that differentiate X from Y are (in my humble opinion), you X'ers adopted the new technologies as they came out and utilized and revolutionized the development of them. We of Gen Y have never known a world without this sort of power, but understand what it was like before it. Technology isn't a tool we have mastered, it's an extension of ourselves.

There is no way for an ISP to tell the difference between me broadcasting a transaction and me connecting to download a patch to a game via p2p eg world of Warcraft. Also you could always buy bitcoin in person with cash.

I hate to say this, but something about this story doesn't make sense. The 1 coin was sent anonymously somewhere, then the .5 coin was received anonymously and deposited somewhere. I don't understand exactly what happened. Could you elaborate on the the timeline and what actions were yours and what was the hacker's?

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe any world power currently possesses neutron bombs to wipe out the entire world power grid. The only thing that could is a supernova of a very close star, or possibly a quasar jet becoming pointed at us, in which case we're fucked anyway.

What if I could offer you the toaster for cheaper? If you buy a toaster for 1 bitcoin at $100 (shut up, it's a nice toaster) instead of $110 dollars fiat, you might rather keep your bitcoins and buy fiat because bitcoins will appreciate 2% the next year, so in 5 years you'll have lost money by not saving it. But would you rather have the extra 10 dollars now, or in 5 years? Not everybody has a cushion of thousands of dollars they are leaning on. If I want a toaster now, I want it for as cheap as I can, so I can afford other things too. If I used fiat, I would have to not do things I could otherwise do. Think of how many people are in credit card debt. That interest rate is a lot higher than the appreciation rate of bitcoins at that point in time.

That's why you can actually salt your own passwords. Add your email address or the site name somewhere in there and the hashes will be different for every site, and rainbow tables won't be easily used.

That is why silkroad is great for bitcoin. It offers products and services you can't necessarily get in person for cash.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:27:09
Simple. We get to a point where the food, water, and shelter is cheaper by more than the appreciation of the coins. If my rent was x bitcoins=$975 instead of $1000 fiat, as long as x bitcoins don't gain $25 worth of value in a month, I'm making more money. Also, the landlord is guaranteed to have my money without waiting for banks to clear my check, I can pay from anywhere, and because it's from me to him directly, there are no fees or dealing with other entities, so it's easier and cheaper.

Why can a botnet break litecoin and not bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:27:27
You always have to trust someone. Because of the nature of bitcoin, all transactions are final, so for exchanges you have to give them money before they give you the coins. If you go through localbitcoins you can find someone and go there with cash in hand and wait for some confirmations then give them the cash.
@_date: 2013-06-17 13:54:00
They couldn't use rainbow tables, salting would add a length of 4-8 characters, and bruteforcing with that wouldn't necessarily guarantee it's the right hash.
