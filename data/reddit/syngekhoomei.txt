On top of individual envy, it's worth keeping in mind that extreme inequality is a destabilizing, negative force in any society.  
It hurts all of us when people's potential is stifled by a lack of access to resources.

I don't understand all the altcoin hate here.  If you're really interested in cryptocurrency as a concept, watching people diversify and experiment should be exciting!  Some of them are scammy distractions, but most of what would have been scamcoins in 2013 are just ICO's now.

Some discussion of this [here]( but I'm glad you asked, because I haven't thought too much about specifically why 10 minutes was selected. 
Ten minute blocks are mentioned in the white paper, but used more as an easy-to-calculate example number.

That drives me crazy too, especially phrases like "leveraging the power of blockchain" or "integrated with blockchain" or worst of all, "the important thing about Bitcoin is actually blockchain."

The difficulty of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks, or roughly two weeks, to keep the frequency of blocks at 10 minutes apart on average.  If mining hardware gets faster, the network makes it more difficult.  If mining power leaves the network, it gets easier.

It's also often heavily implied that blockchain tech had been used in some significant way before Bitcoin.

The Marshmallow Experiment essentially proves that trusting authority is a good strategy in a stable environment.  Would the children who waited for the second marshmallow have done so well in a society with high corruption or instability, where promises from authority figures are less likely to be honored?  Replay the experiment in a different society and you might find the skeptic/scarcity mindset is more successful. 
Younger generations in the US were part of this experiment on a nationwide scale, accepting outrageous education-debt burdens with the promise of a marshmallow on the other end - financial stability, opportunity, and, in some cases, [loan forgiveness](  
Everyone who entered the job market in 2008 as the market exploded is still waiting for marshmallow   It's never coming. Subsequent generations are adjusting their strategies after seeing what happened. Trust the man in the lab coat at your own peril.

You're absolutely right, and Bitcoin will be much better off in the long run if the people involved with it are thinking critically about the system and asking questions like yours on the way to a full understanding.

I've got a Circle account and haven't experienced any of this.  I didn't link a credit card, though, so that's probably where their paranoia sets in.


Not impossible, but it is an immediate jump to the worst case scenario.  
It seems like the credit card is the unifying factor in all of the difficulties you and your friends faced. I can't say I blame Circle for being overly cautious, even if it does ruin the "smooth and seamless" experience they're trying for. When you're exchanging irreversible value for reversible value, you have to protect yourself.

I like that even though the internet is an endless churn of new information, little bits of the past peek through every now and again and make me think there's some permanence to it.

I believe they hard-forked to return ETH taken from the DAO.  They didn't create more, they moved it.
I don't think they've decided what to do about the Parity wallet situation, but a hard fork to release the frozen funds is one of the options.

The mayor's not keen on mining activity using their cheap power. The city's ~~shutting down~~ not issuing new permits for mining operations for 18 months so they can update their land use law - "This moratorium will allow time for the zoning code and municipal lighting department regulations to be amended to regulate this potential use."
EDIT: I misread the law - this is a moratorium on *new permits* for mining operations; they're not shutting down existing facilities.
