You guys keep using that word profit, I don't think it means what you think it means. The whole time you were talking about revenue until you said the definition of profit.

Do we know approximately what portion $600 millionish of demand of bitcoin is? Are we talking 1% of the total demand, 20%, or .001%? Just trying to get a frame of reference on the potential impact.

I mean google it. It's private. You can see the valuations from VC firms during different series. I hung out with one of the co-founders at a party and he was a mega-douche and oozed "I may not have been popular in high school, but I'm rich AF now".

You lock in the price that on the moment you purchase at, so the time doesn't matter unless you're trying to day trade or something.

I don't understand what this is asking. What is a middleman? These are two separate transactions that have nothing to do with each other.
If someone works for McDonald's and pays their cashier $200 and that cashier buys black tar heroin, the police are not going to charge McDonald's with drug dealing.

Says who? The market cap /= money invested in bitcoin

I mean, you didn't get it for free per se. You gambled and you won.

Tramp from his high school was there. She clearly didn't give him the time of day then, or for the first 30 minutes of the party. Then she got an inkling of how much money he was worth. She then threw herself at him for the rest of the night and they fucked.

Hopefully you bought your piece of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:24:25
Oddly specific.

I'll take the one on the left, what's the price?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:33:37
For forks sake, some of us bought in the past couple of months.

You are missing something. The market cap means, if I buy 1 Bitcoin, I'm buying it as if the value was $131.5B. It doesn't mean there are $113.5B dollars backing bitcoin. It's like stocks, many times companies are worth many more times there annual profits.

Just do coinbase. Everyone here tries to give noobs tips but it's overwhelming. Coinbase is easiest to get started. They charge a premium, but it's worth it to get you started. After you get started, research and find better ways to buy/sell etc.
