Time is a flat circle.

Isn’t Tom a bull?

I bought like 2 hours ago at $7,700 after seeing it up from $7450 last night. Glad I didn’t wait longer.

These things are dumb

How many Teslas you got?

$30 isn’t an investment. It’s not even enough for Mexican food

Accumulate. Dca. Dca auto corrects to scary. It's a sign. This is your sign.

I've missed these memes. I literally don't even care anymore about how much the prices drop. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:16:51
If I sold tomorrow BTC would double in Price and I'll sit here and cry.

He has a lambo, do you?

This is the world most disgusting Burger King. I used to hop on Bart right there every morning.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:28:40
Is he poor still?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:48:51
He's not poor he's just broke as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 06:25:59
What if I told you....

Price prediction at that time: $202,000 = 5x20x2020

Anyone notice that BCH is the most donated? Compared to like .1 BTC. Somethings up.
