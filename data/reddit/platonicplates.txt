Weird. The link works for me.

Bitcoin certainly has never experienced a mass, multi-million dollar service go under and turn out to be a scam. /s
That being said, it is still a shame it happened.

I am the guy who asked the question.
If this was just a random AMA with a smaller game company, I think you would be 100% right.
But, Gabe Newell isn't an idiot and Valve has a much better handle on economics than we give them credit for (see Yanis Varoufakis, TF2 hats, and Steam Trading Cards) so I didn't feel it was necessary to plug a BTC/USD exchange when I knew the response was going to let us peer more into Valve's thought processes and methodologies.

Haha. It is all good.

Dogecoin wasn't mentioned in the title. That is the ticket :P

[Twitter was founded in 2006 and at the end of 2009 had 75 millions users](
[Blockchain.info founded in 2011 and in January 2014 they claimed to have 1.1 million users](

Can we get mod verification up in here?

Wait. What company hired who? Are you saying you have something to do with Coinpal?

set a very inquisitive and curious tone in his post, he didn't want to start a flame war.

The CEO has spoken. Buy all the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:47:54
Wow. That is pretty lame.

With respect, I didn't say anything about risks, I just wanted to know their opinion about it.
However that being said and once again with respect, there are still risks with a company that large adopting BTC. They deal in billions of dollars worth of sales and the crypto market is too tumultuous for their blood and that is a perfectly reasonable thing to think from a business perspective.

That is why I put the /s at the end. :)
I do believe that Mt. Gox was a mass, multi-million dollar service failure/scam.

They said they are going to invest in the spread of bitcoin overtime and sell it to make money.
EDIT: This is according to [The Verge report on Circle](
"Circle isn’t devoting much time at the moment to the revenue side of its operation, but it says it will make money on the "spread" from acquiring and converting currency at market rates. Over time, it's easy to imagine the company adding fees for services that it charges to merchants."

Isn't it kind of weird that they didn't partner with Jack Dorsey's company Square on this?
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:47:24
All good. :)

My understanding was that he was exiled in 2009/2010 and started Square but he was brought back on to serve as Executive Chairman. His CrunchBase profile still says as much.

Is Striple less janky now? I used it about a year ago and was not really impressed.

25 *million*. If we saw a 25B investment into a bitcoin service I would hope the price would go up a tad.
