Is it that hard to guess?  Credibility of the currency.

Then you deserve your fate.  If you are going to do business, keep records.  Simple as that.  Your Bitcoin scenario just puts the risk on the buyer, which is a consumer model that simply won't work.  Bottom line is that this is a horrible example to further your cause.  Be a better business person and you'll be in better shape than using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:34:25
I agree.  Can you explain the comparison between CYNK and Bitcoin?

Refinancing at the lowest interest rates in history.  Prudent thing to do.

The Russian GDP per capita is about 25% of that of the US - and that's if you believe Russia's numbers.  Also keep in mind, the Russian economy is LITTERED with corruption, where literally billions of dollars are handed to Putin's cronies.  They spent how much building a road up the mountain in the Sochi Olympics?  10's of billions, if I recall correctly.  So corruption, geopolitical tension, a gov't that can essentially seize businesses as they see fit, and you are trying to put that on an even playing field with the US?  And a small hiccup is how to describe the Ruble crisis?  The currency literally collapsed.  That's not a hiccup, you fucking moron.  
Just read your posting history.  Didn't realize you were a troll.  I'll just leave you be now.  In the meantime, do some of your own due diligence.

As an alternative currency - a hedge, at best, vs the "traditional" currencies out there, be it government-issued or  raw material.
The internet didn't turn your old copper phone line into a gold mine or vice versa.  This isn't a case of innovation.  It's a case of diversification, at best.
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:51:37
Because the whole "accept bitcoin" schtick is a tactic of inferior retailers.  newegg &gt; tiger; amazon &gt; overstock.  It's a grasping marketing ploy to appeal to a niche group of consumers who would rather post on Reddit  "I paid with Bitcoin" then say "I got a good deal" or "I value a top notch selection or customer experience."
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:27:31
You don't see a difference between the US dollar and the Zimbabwe dollar, for example? You are blindly and/or stupidly ignoring the power and the full faith and credit of the United States.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:10:16
Fair enough.  But that's hardly the definition of a currency, which is what Bitcoin is intended for.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:17:46
Is Bitcoin a currency or an investment?  Seems like you guys have lost focus.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:18:26
You took the bait, as expected.  It's one thing to chirp "corporate welfare" for tax breaks (and even loopholes) that help corporations.  Literally handing money to your friends is far different.  The corruption in Russia is so far beyond comparison - it's like the Zimbabwe Dollar vs US Dollar distinction you still don't understand.

Is this the point where I tip you in Dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:49:35
Reason  why your Bitcoin movement is fucked - people like you argue in favor of Bitcoin via a contention that the Russian economy is strong.  Good luck to you and your internet chips.  
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:29:19
I have one.  It's a gimmick watch.  "Accepting Bitcoin" doesn't change that.  That's the fuck of this whole Bitcoin fanboy stuff - accepting Bitcoin doesn't make TigerDirect or Overstock superior retailers, for example.  They are still second fiddle to their obviously better competitors.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:32:10
Bingo.  A bottle of water at the airport gift shop costs 2-3x what it would cost at the grocery store, too.  It's the price of "convenience" for those who weren't able to plan ahead.  
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:58:15
Of course you do. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:33:29
What example of a historical currency are you comparing the current day US dollar?  There simply isn't one that stacks up in the slightest.
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:43:48
Amen.  Fucking d-bag above basically saying Bitcoin is too advanced for the likes of Whole Foods shoppers.  Such an ass.  90% of the Bitcoin gang is the basement dwellers with a few "coins" hoping to generate a PR campaign to make them worth millions.  Not going to happen.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:43:56
So you paid in dollars. Nothing to circle jerk about here. Cool car, though. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:59:59
Yeah, because CYNK and Bitcoin are related in any way at all.
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:20:36
You're fucking joking, right?  That's like saying Citibank stock is back to normal.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:39:22
Currency and investment are very different things. In the "old world," if you needed to save up some money for your kid's braces, for example, would you stash money in a savings account or a volatile (though potentially promising) stock? 
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:16:51
Are you Vladimir Putin's mom or just a fucking moron?  You see Russia in a position of strength?
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:20:02
Did you say "rothbardian anarcho-capitalist" with a straight face?  Who fucking writes like that?
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:19:29
You are Bitcoin's biggest problem.  You think this is a "the masses don't realize how smart we are" get rich quick scheme.  It's a supposed currency, not a stock.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:52:36
Correct.  The original purpose was a "currency."  
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:57:50
But bro, dozens of bitcoin junkies will start using Bing now because it is better. Just like overstock is better than amazon,right?
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:02:32
This post sums up Bitcoin quite nicely.  Some folks buying random stuff just so they can use Bitcoin.  Others too hipster to use their Bitcoin because they are butthurt by an apparent Christian symbol.  Too many folks just trying to be different to make this a viable widely-adopted currency.
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:59:34
You are exactly why Bitcoin has become a shell of its initial intent.  
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:18:07
I'd contend 80% of your bitcoin fanboys are the same - gamblers hoping their bitcoin triples in value, without having a clue of how that works.  
Doesn't change the fact that Peter Schiff is a complete asshat, however.  Dude is a doomsday clown who has taken it in the shorts.

First of all, that's not true. Second of all, the dollar is so liquid someone could say they accept donuts as currency and it would be just fine.

My financial apocalypse strategy is unlikely to hinge upon something called coinapult.  Just nope.

For fucks sake, here we go again with the Ron/Rand Paul nonsense.  Both are a hit in niche segments of internet message boards and straw poll moonbats, but barely beat "undecided" and "margin of error" when the election occurs.  And rightfully so - gold standard, Bitcoin takeover, etc.  Cute, but wildly infeasible.
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:19:09
Yeah his dad won it a bunch, too, and barely beat "unknown" when it mattered.

But bank money doesn't vaporize.  As I understand it, there have been instances where Bitcoins vaporize.  Poof.

Even if you put aside the fact that most of the lemmings bought in far more recently, 400% in 24 months hardly describes something that is a safe haven and/or near perfect.  Again, knock it off.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:45:50
What f'ing evidence are you talking about?  Shit tons of volatility?  A misleading article that cites a correlation with gold that barely pre-dates Christmas 2018?  You're proving my point far better than I can.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:59:33
You're adorable. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:06:19
How the hell can anything that's gone from $16k to under $4k in a year be seen as a save haven, let alone "near perfect"?  Knock it off.  Your talking points are the typical lemming nonsense, and the hyperbole makes it even more laughable.

I've used traditional ATMs literally hundreds (if not thousands) of times in my life.  Those damn things count money exactly right, every time.  Never gotten an extra $20, never been shorted a $20.  In that regard, they have performed far better than the bitcoin ATM described in this thread.
