Protectionist policies are only one form of market manipulation. But yes, many economists agree that THAT ONE SINGLE FORM of market manipulation is bad.

But bit coin is also not commodity money so what is the real difference?
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:37:58
Can someone please explain to me how bit coin isn't a fiat currency?
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:55:47
No this is what I am looking for. Please continue.

I would say that if you say it is undesirable you are wrong. Market manipulation is incredibly important because there are so many societal problems that have no market solution. Pollution, for instance. Or market manipulation to stop unfair monopolies. If anything, modern economics is turning AWAY from the idea that a totally free market is desirable.

Ok, maybe what I am asking is more technical than you are capable of explaining. Other than "USD is backed and regulated by the us government" how is bit pin different from USD as a store of value

No... Commodity money is backed by a commodity... That's why I wonder what exactly is the difference between fiat and btc

I don't have a negative/positive opinion of bitcoin yet. I am not trying to use the 'negative' connotation of fiat to push opinions either way. If bitcoin represents value that is determined by the arbitrary whims of the market, then how is it realistically different than other fiat currencies? The value is, in a sense, arbitrary because it isn't tied to a commodity. I guess my question is, how is the value determined bottom up? How is bitcoin assigned it's value that is different from how a dollar is assigned value? ANd I am not looking for a semantic "bitcoin isn't involved with the governemnt" answer. USD has value because people accept that it is worth something, how is this different than bitcoin?
Also, try to be less condescending in your answer please. I study economics and to say "Economics tends to frown heavily on market manipulation and believes it never had a good outcome" is so wrong that it is laughable.

There isn't anything in economic theory that says market manipulation is bad, that is my point. Just because economists don't think the government is doing a good job manipulating the market doesn't mean "economic theory" whatever that means says that market manipulation is bad.
Economic theory is about how the economy works. Economic theory analyzes how market manipulation affects the market. If you are going to talk about this topic you need to 1) educate yourself 2) stop using the phrasing you are currently using and remove it from your lexicon. 
This is a side-tracked discussion anyway, my question still hasn't been answered.

What do you think taxes are? What do you think subsidies are? What about tariffs and other trade barriers? It is an incredible over-simplification to say economics frowns on market manipulation. You started your post off criticizing people who use dishonest rhetoric but that is exactly what you are doing.
