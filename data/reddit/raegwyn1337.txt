its the same with all forms of money. it has value as long as the people believe in it and are willing to accept its value.
if tomorrow everyone agrees that 1 USD is just a worthless piece of paper and no one is willing to exchange anything for it, USD is worthless.
same goes for BTC.
i dont think the tech can be "wiped out". there is the possibility of quantum computers fucking it up, or the theoretical possibility of a 51% attack. but aside from that i dont think it can be "wiped out".
but yeah if ppl for some reason stop to believe in its value, its value is gone.

Bitcoin is a new form of money, that trys to give the people the power to decide about their own money. no goverment can decide to print more btc. no bank can close your account, freeze your money or something like that. no third party (bank) is needed and has to allow you to send value to someone else om earth, its up to you.
BTC gives the people the power over their own money and makes banks obsolete.
if you should invest? i cant say. I think long term BTC will rise, but i can be wrong. and even if im right, not everyone is made for the volatile behaviour that crypto markets have.

Start small. With a tiny amount of money and play around, learn how trading works and how markets react.
You can read a lot but learning by doing works best.
After a few months when you are used to stuff you can start putting in more.
Never ever put in any cent you cant lose.
