You are on Reddit my fine friend. We are of the highest calibre of human that can be found on the planet.

I would literally get the highest amount of loans I could reasonably get where interest wouldn’t kill me, and sell all I had and do that. Would be amazing. I wasted so much money between 2010 and 2012 that I also could have spent on crypto. I had a few Bitcoin but ended up selling them as I didn’t think too much about them back then...
@_date: 2019-11-20 05:34:40
Yeah but it was so dirt cheap then too. Sell everything to buy except what you need to mine.

Probably not realistic that quickly but I’m with McAfee that bitcoin over the next few years will seriously skyrocket.

Nah I’m not an idiot. Only betting my money.

I need 99.99% loss of value. I won’t accept anything else my friend ;)
That goes for my personal portfolio and the dollar. Why I stay away from crypto like the plague.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:28:38
Why do you think that?

I agree. But I think crypto needs to become the new “reserve” currency and I believe it will happen at some point.
I hodl my crypto. As soon as merchants allow me to use crypto I’ll convert my dollar to crypto to use normally. But I’ll still have a majority of my crypto that stays put. I believe in the long term durability of crypto and have been also keeping an eye out on new ones. Most are crap but here and there one catches my eye so I invest a small amount in it. My estimation is that there will be between 7 and 12 dominate crypto currencies. My estimation there also includes the dollar and a majority of normal currencies getting devalued and sinking. I think more than half of the 7-12 have yet to be created however.
A lot of them will have different use cases.

I mean if the dollar fails and the fed continues to keep printing off money $1B bitcoin is easily possible.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:05:11
Lol I know. Why I exaggerated the number ever so slightly. It seems like people don’t understand sarcasm on reddit unless you tag it that way. I think you got it though. :)
I think I see $100,000 as a remote possibility (I see $50,000 as more realistic) and then a very fast nosedive as literally every “hodler” sells because everyone forgets the whole point of this is decentralization. Not making money. I’m slowly trying to convert my assets into Crypto and real estate. I think the dollar will collapse and the Fed will be held responsible and we’ll finally stop using Fiat currency. Don’t know when but anytime between next year and ten years out I see it happening. I for sure would prefer that to Venezuela happening to our currency. A few years of complete crap but then we’d have a lot more prosperity for the common man. Though it seems whenever I talk to anyone about this they think I’m on mushrooms... never had more than one drink in my life and never smoked or taken drugs outside of surgeries. I just don’t see our current economic system surviving in the long term. But why should I care? I’m old enough I may die before that happens. Just care about my kids future.

Can you give me something other than a YouTube link? This coming from someone who is not sure on UBI. I just don’t really watch or listen to videos on YouTube or the such
