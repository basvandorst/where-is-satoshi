GDP obviously.

Well idk about you but im in America the wealthiest nation in the world, and the police are abusing their power my governor is saying hes gonna send the national guard to forcibly take people guns, and the banks/federal reserve work together to keep the poor struggling to survive. This country is fucked up as hell, and we need to do something about it.

Yes you can also voluntariy give a higher fee to have your transaction processed faster if you want.

Sorry you seem to be under the impression that im some 2nd amendment nut that gives a shit about what the consitition says. Sure its got some good bits but its heavily flawed and doesnt even support people privately owning guns imo. Im a libertarian socialist borderline anarchocommunist. I dont give a shit about laws or hierarchy. The governments only purpose imo should be to provide services for people. Laws should only be in place to stop people from harming eachother, and they should be enforced by community volunteers not police. Preventitive laws (like banning guns) shouldnt be allowed. Universal background checks are fine since that person has already shown themselves to be a risk, but someone with no background should be allowed to own any gun that the government can use. If the government wants to ban weapons because theyre just too dangerous thats reasonable, but they should also be forced to not use them. The government having more firepower than the people is a recipe for dictatorship.

Depends on the type of socialist bud. Im a libertarian socialist personally and love me some bitcoin. i am very anti-authority. You dont really know much about socialism im guessing you have just been spoon fed the socialism that the media likes to push. Think about how many people think bitcoin is for criminals because thats what the media spoon fed them. Socialism is as diverse as capitalism is. There are many kinds some of which look nothing alike.

The fed is a private entity that works hand in hand with those corporations.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:07:55
Virginia look it up dude.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:27:52
Ya it is but that doesnt change the fact its also the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. its just that all the wealth is in a few hands.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:52:21
There is less advantage and more risk with a centralized bank when it comes to bitcoin. Wallets already allow you to tranafer and store funds easily and securely on your own the only reason to use a centralized bank is to have them do it all for you which is unnessesary, and risky. 
Ill never understand the obsession people these days have with giving up control to others out of fear.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:01:51
Ya but you arent measuring anything? Its just a phrase.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:52:25
The US is in its most corrupt, and unequal time. Also its most prosperous.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:29:47
I dont personally own any guns i just think that people have a right to protect themselves, and support gun ownership. If i ever feel i need a gun i think i should be able to get one. Same reason i support legaized weed even though i dont smoke.
@_date: 2019-12-09 05:02:34
This is such an obvious scam lmao. Why does it “look legit?” Its a fucking discord pm...
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:56:59
I can have my bitcoin in my paypal as cash in under like 2 minutes for a small fee. That fee has nothing to do with bitcoin though. Its just for converting it to fiat. Currency exchanges usually have fees lol.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:49:55
America has the highest GDP. Your whining about me whining instead of whining why dont you go to another thread where people are willing to listen to you. You act like i go to choose my spawn point lmao.
Edit: i dont know where you got the "worst crime" bit from either. I was just giving an example that id seen recently nowhere did i say it was the worst thing America has done or could do.

Get a hardware wallet for that much

The people who control our economy can only do so because they control the fed though. Its the instrument they use to keep everything in their favor. It IS the source of the power they wield or at least a very large part of it. Eliminate the feds power over us, and it would terrify those in control.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:18:00
Not just the state though. The entire ruling class be that private or public is the enemy of the people. Bankers especially for bitcoin because it replaces them.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:14:35
You pretty much just described bernie sanders policies
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:40:28
Which is why i specified the economy.
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:47:41
i never said he was a socialist. hes a democratic socialist. I support him, but i dont agree with him on everything.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:58:07
The fed controls the economy directly through methods like quantitative easing and manipulation of interest rates. It is the strings to the economys pupet.
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:19:04
A bank account offers extra services over a cash wallet having your own bitcoin wallet vs having a web wallet is the same thing but where you control the private keys which control access to the wallet. If you wanna not be in control of your own money thats on you im just letting you know you dont know what your talking about.
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:15:35
Im not OP
@_date: 2019-12-08 06:50:46
No. It doesnt. Stop fucking with OP.
@_date: 2019-12-16 07:43:51
ya huge market crash imminent because of it too
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:53:57
you dont understand the appeal of alliteration i guess?
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:21:53
Ya the internet isnt one thing. They could cut undersea cables, but then we’d still have the national servers to connect to. It would be rough tho
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:07:05
The government forcibly disarming their population is a bad sign. Im pro gun reform i just dont think they should be banned outright.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:43:10
Highest GDP - We are wealthiest we just have all the wealth concentrated in a few hands. The US is highly corrupt, and unequal. Its an empire in decline.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:52:02
i mean i tried to get bernie sanders elected in 2016 talk to the other americans
@_date: 2019-12-10 05:18:41
Bitcoin has its own banking system built in its called wallets lmao. You need to do some research.
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:07:18
Lots of renewable energy sources in WA try to find a Dam to setup by and make sure they know youll be usung that much power. Work it out with the power company before hand.
