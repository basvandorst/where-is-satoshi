Feels like a very poor TA, since if btc breaks the support (which is more and more likely if it get challenged that often), it can go even more down.
Moreover, the "bounce" could be only technical, and not an actual tendancy.
I would personally love a bullish trend but let's not be blinded by these kind of analysis

Sorry i'm a noob, but why are there people against the activation of SegWit ? what are objectively the cons of it ?

Did you just copy what said ?
I'll copy my answer then : No, it's not just a refund. Tapie received more than 40 million euros for moral prejudice, which, for every people who knows the french judicial system, is fucking ridiculous. We are in a country where someone who did 20 yrs in jail while he was innocent received 1 million (Patrick Dils for people interested) and overall known for very little consideration about moral prejudice, and yet we grant Tapie this ridiculous amount. We all know it's a rigged decision but Lagarde received the Clinton treatment, guilty but no sanction. And then they dont understand why far right rises. Fuck them.
PS : And no, Lagarde is not innocent. She is the one who decided to do an arbitration which wasn't necessary, overruling a decision of the french Justice.

So explain me why Lagarde forced an arbitration ?
Explain me the 40 millions for moral prejudice ? Is this business Law aswell ? 
Even a really partial CJR (which shouldn't even exist) said she was guilty of negligence, lmao.

Black light to reveal 6 encrypted words
6 Barcodes hidden in the "Van Gogh style" background that when decrypted reveal the 6 other words.
I couldn't crack the 6 barcodes. Also I don't know how they figured out the order of the words.
The guy who solved it will explain everything next week. I hope it's something hard enough that I won't have regret ahah :D
(for info the blacklight words are :
Y29uZHVpcmU=      (CONDUIRE base 64)
dHJpb21waGU=		(TRIOMPHE base 64)
ATOUT  = UNION (Cesar +6)
JPAVFLU = CITOYEN (Cesar +6)
=&gt; JAUNE and HORIZON (AES encryption, you need the key to decrypt which is given by the artist after sending him the email (03012009))
