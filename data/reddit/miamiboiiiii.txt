If you can lose it and who gives a shit: Do it now. 5 years from now it'll pay for your home. Not joking.

You people call it "pump and dump".
I'm calling it "bitcoin going mainstream". More and more people are going into Bitcoin now, and it's starting to get more recognition and buyers. $16k is **infancy**, Bitcoin will be worth at least $1MM within the next 5 years.
As it's price increases, so will the RATE of adoption, and then we'll see some shit. $16k will be seen how we currently see $400. "Oh I should've bought in when it was at $400!"

I'm looking forward to 50k. 50k means mainstream adoption and larger market cap.

I'm a programmer - but know very little about bitcoin except it's price on gdax.
Can someone explain in layman terms what this is?
- Is it an alt-coin?
- Is it a bitcoin "addon"?
- Is it a pull-request for Bitcoin to have faster transactions?
- Is it a coinbase competitor that has faster transaction speeds and lower fees?
A lot of assumed previous knowledge in these vids but I'm sure a lot of would greatly appreciate some context.
Thanks in advance!
