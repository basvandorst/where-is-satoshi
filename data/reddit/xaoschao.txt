Who else just doesn't give a fuck what government overlords try to impose?
Its irrelevant.  I have silver age comics and some nice vinyl LP records to sell for BTC.  Anyone interested? How is any government going to tax or stop a crytocurrency transaction like that?  I don't really know what capital gains are, and when I buy a cup of coffee with BTC, I know I still won't know/care.
For regular working class people, the proclamation from the IRS means dick-all.  I want to sell and buy things w/o bullshit.  Thats Bitcoin, and the masses aren't going to use/think of it like property, and they sure as shit won't be calculating potential capital gains taxes.  
Hopefully, people will just live without the government more and more.

Time is really weird too when you think about it.  Between money and time humans pretty much exist in a reality of their own making.

Because money is an abstract concept, and when it comes to fiat currency, arbitrary.  Gold has 'intrinsic worth' because humans like shiny things.  If this sounds like psychological bullshit, its because it at least partly is.  All dealings with money will be in part psychological or based on psychology.  Or pure bullshit if you prefer.

They'll just throw extra charges at him.  Like the entire justice "system" its a fucking joke.

This is facebook we're talking about here...you sure that's even possible?   
On the other side of things, I see a bunch of late adopters vulnerable to scams once they do get on board...

Seriously?  You just said that to me? Lol.
Your "social contract" is imposed from above via coercion, therefore it is not a contract.  You can convince yourself through any turn of your mind you like.  A contract only exists when two parties agree to be bound by terms.  Mere existence is not consent.  You sound like a rapist.
Hobbes.  Bellum omnium contra omnes.  I'd add 'damnant quod non intelligunt' to that.

Free money either doesn't exist (TNSTAAFL) or is obtained through fraud.  Taxes are theft, short and simple.  A government takes a portion of your money and decides how to spend it.  That's theft. The Bitcoin protocol allows for that bullshit to go away, when used strickly as a currency, not changing back to fiat, and not as property.

The President of The Internet might fine them.  Everyone knows the CEO of Bitcoin is a fraudster.

Say, you look like a strong adventurer!  We've been having trouble with some Orc's up in the hills past my farm, there's a little gold in it for ya if you can clear them out?

We've done away with needing a centralized power for currency, we need to take the next step and get rid of countries.

I totally agree.  People should *always* be aware of that anytime anyone is talking money anywhere about anything.
For example, I saw my $1.10 USD worth of BTC rise to $1.17 and I started to go to the moon myself...until I calmed myself down and thought:  Risk is risk, simply do not risk what you can't afford to lose forever, regardless of your personal financial position.

You are correct.  If immigrating was that easy, I'd be gone a long time ago.  Most people don't even bother unless 1) They are really wealthy or 2) Their life and the lives of their family/community are in real danger.

Yea, thats not a lot at all.  I totally see what you're saying.  I would totally be willing to relieve that burden from you, by however much you want:

Yes, because you should be celebrating the tyranny of a peacful person being jailed for resisting theft from a government.

The government has their own reality.  Most people who are into partisan politics do to.

Where was the contract he signed to have to pay a certain share?
Its all coercion, its not ethical, its tyrannical.  That is government.
