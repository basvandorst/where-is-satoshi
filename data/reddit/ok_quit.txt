read the replies from eddy, he's right. it also depends about how the channel was funded. If you fund 100% of the channel you already have maximum capacity at your side, and you can't receive more than maximum channel capacity. In that case when you spend your coins you are making room to receive in your wallet.
but if you and the other party for example funded the channel 50/50 your initial channel state would be:
* Capacity: 0.005 BTC
* Can send: 0.0025 BTC
* Can receive: 0.0025 BTC 
In that case above you didn't need to spend anything, you already arranged room in your channel side to receive when both of you opened the channel.
Most of the time you'll open channels by providing 100% of the funds yourself if you're a buyer. If you're a merchant you'll not be providing funds to your clients' channels. to be honest I thought you had trouble understanding how a channel was funded in my reply.

if some part of the network drifts away from the current consensus it creates a fork, that is, a different coin with different rules. but if you remain in consensus with your network the rules are validated autonomously. Full node validation software runs independently as a background task on a computer, without the user noticing, validating all the rules for the new transactions.
economic majority does not dictate consensus. what dictates consensus is fully validating nodes running on the same network. people run the code out of free will.
edit: developers don't control it because they need to convince users to run the code.

Privacy is very important. You'll need these:
1. A fully synced Bitcoin Core node (
2. Electrum Personal Server ( 
3. Electrum Wallet (
Use the respective documentation to install and start those programs. The full node can take a week to sync, depending of your connection and hardware.
Implied, but if you want privacy stop using Microsoft Windows, move to Linux (Ubuntu is easy:  xD).
For maximum control and privacy sync your Bitcoin Core node on a computer of yours, maybe a laptop or one of those tiny ARMs. Do not use a VPS if you can.
Install Tor in you computer. In the Bitcoin Core configuration file add:  
    proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
    onlynet=onion
    server=1   
 
Although for the initial sync I'd suggest not adding the onlynet option for speed, and add it after the node is synced for the first time to keep it up to date.
As suggested in the EPS repo start Electrum wallet with
    electrum --oneserver --server localhost:50002:s
from a terminal (assumes fully synced Core node and EPS running).
Once you have you Electrum wallet connected (green dot in bottom right corner) connect your hardware wallet and follow the Electrum wallet procedure to import balances.
Now, when creating a transaction do not broadcast it from your systems. You can use blockchain.info push tx page ( or similar service.
In this way the hardware wallet will communicate only to the Electrum Wallet. The Electrum Wallet will only communicate to your local EPS which will in turn communicate only to your local full node. The full node will communicate only via tor with other nodes. In that way you can check balances and create transactions fully locally.
That's the basic part and only protects you from network analysis, but not from blockchain analysis. Sure this guide can be improved. Do your own research.

adoption will rise when bitcoin becomes easier and cheaper to use than other alternatives. unfortunately decentralization comes with high fees, until now, but with lightning network will enable mainstream capabilities to bitcoin. no one will be using credit card anymore for internet payments.

to achieve this in practice is to realize such a wallet on top of

they require a special device it seems. not the bitcoin way imo. by the way, wtf is the pinocchio coin they mention?

@_date: 2018-06-22 20:18:30
bitcoin is more divisible up to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin, that is called satoshi subunit. bitcoin regulates itself, bitcoin is more secure because its properties don't make it easier for govs to confiscate it. bitcoin is trustless, gold bars were falsified before. bitcoin is faster, you can send a bitcoin to the butt of the world in minutes, whereas moving gold costs millions.

if for average user you mean people like you and me well , it's not for the average user right now. if everyone started using bitcoin fees will skyrocket to 10, 30 dollars per tx. some banks are piloting test for inter bank transfers, but they are talking about enormous transfers, bypassing swift with bitcoin.
but for example in Venezuela or other country with similar situation the average user could benefit very much of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:46:07

lmao dogecoin has more transaction activity than bitcoin cash, bch (bcash).
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:22:02
ok, let's say you have $100 in bitcoins in a normal legacy wallet. then you download a lightning wallet to test it.
in order to use the lightning network you have to open a payment channel from the lightning wallet. Opening a channel means you make your current bitcoins available to use in the lightning network. Think of it as giving superpowers to your current coins (those superpowers being super fast and cheap transactions).
You have to move your funds into an special address created by the lightning wallet. This act of moving funds into a channel does not constitute 'spending' your coins, you're just transferring them to your channel. All this process is made easy by the wallet.
Your coins are still yours, you have complete control over them, they are just locked in a safe way into a smart contract to enable them being moved inside the LN. You can close the channel at any time to get your bitcoins out of LN.
Opening a channel will cost you only the transaction fees, and the same for the closing transaction.
Once you have an open channel you will find an option in your lightning wallet to create a lightning payment invoice. Tune that invoice and move it around to anyone you want to pay you.

@_date: 2018-07-01 16:15:04
read here: 
one point he makes in the article is true as explained in my link above:








So basically, your node will get a "lightweight" version of SegWit transactions.
but that seems to be no problem because everyone still remains in the same consensus. by old nodes segwit txs will look as anyone can spend, but no one but the real owner will be able to spend them.
I think there was a risk about reverting the softfork. If miners reverted the segwt softfork then yes all the segwit txs will be spendable by anyone. But that would take a 51% attack, so same security assumption than we had before segwit. we would just bust the miners with a pow algo change.
If at the time of the upgrade miners were the only ones running softfork software maybe they could trick the rest of the network into accepting bad transactions, but that's another assumption of bitcoin, that nodes are there to validate what miners do.
or i may be wrong so ask an expert. i just like to write a lot.

govs can block tor. if they can block tor they can disrupt any internet protocol. bitcoin cannot survive an Orwellian future, it requires a minimum of freedom to function afaik.
if govs crack down on it seriously bitcoin would be done. no net neutrality, no bitcoin.
