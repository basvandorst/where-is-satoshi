Haha. My friends are the perfect example of this. I keep trying to tell them to learn and understand the tech. After months of educating, they still use Coinbase and are now buying up shitcoins. The only way to learn is to get rekt. Over and over. Fuck it.

Your entire analysis is based on the price. Bitcoin is the most secure, most technically advanced and most reliable crypto currency. Nothing competes with it. Their developers are world class software engineers and cryptographers. 
People believe in bitcoin because it has proven to be the best for the longest time. More people hodl bitcoin than any other coin. The chance of people doubting in it is far less than doubting in a newly created, centralized shitcoin that doesnt follow consensus rules and is being forcefully pushed into the market using manipulative tactics enforced by purely greedy bad actors.
Nevertheless, these shitcoin forks will continue to do their damage and at the same time strengthen bitcoin more and more. In the future, forks will become irrelevant. Most exchanges wont bother adding them.

Cash App if you're in the U.S. or Coinsquare if you're in Canada, but don't keep your coins on there for too long. Buy and move them to a secure wallet where you control your private key.

@_date: 2017-10-16 21:55:58
There are mamu exchanges where you can buy large amounts of BTC. Bitfinex I believe is another one. Coinbase has the biggest user base but now poses a huge threat to bitcoin as they are not revealing their plan for the upcoming fork. If the set the B2X to be the real bitcoin, people would lose a lot of money. They still haven't given people their bcash coins from the last fork.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:15:29
You thought wrong. Thats whats wrong. Think more.

True but even if you didnt memorize your seed, the same attack would be executed if you said you didnt know the seed. Same result but without the risk of the banks screwing you over.

Why not just say bits and refer to satoshis? 1 bit is 0.06 cents.

Your coins? Just get a hardware wallet lioe Trezor or Ledger Nano S and transfer your coins to it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:31:49
Yes. Pray! :) .. jk. As long as you control the key to your coins, your coins are safe. Coinbase is corporate run and I wouldn't trust them.
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:30:12
The more important question is where do you store your seed. Safest location for me is my own head, memorize and repeat every day.
I wouldn't trust storing it in a bank deposit box. If you don't trust banks with your money, you shouldn't trust them with your key to your money either.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:38:32
Coinbase is a bad way to buy and store bitcoin. Use an exchange like kraken if you want to buy more and move your bitcoin to a hardware wallet before the November hard fork.

Even though bits are used as a measure, it is the easiest to remember. When bitcoin hits $10k, 1 bit = 1 cent.

The problem I have is that people trust the current system and believe that nothing can happen to their money in the first place.
Out of 100 people you tell about bitcoin, only one will do their own research on it. 99 will either think of it as a ponzi, a joke, or just another hyped, short-lived event.
I gave up explaining it. Best is to tell them about it and to read up on it and end it there.
