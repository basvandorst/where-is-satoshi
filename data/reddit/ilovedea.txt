As someone who has a big chuck of BTC, i will liquidate all if that happen. 
People who lost money there are responsible for taking the risk.

Probably the author of the transfer want to cash them out asap after the goxfiasco.

As someone who used to launder money: 
 
- you can open account in another exchange and bank and transfer your money through that. I used to have access to hundreds of dummy banks accounts.
- In some countries, you can ask for a loan.
- they can reset your passwords if the support is stupid. It was used to reset hotmail/yahoo passwords.
- forge an identical passport minus the photo.
and many more..

You have to know the addresses first.

My account was inactive for many years. You can understand that they will not release such amount once i claimed it.
The same happened to my forex trading account in liteforex. But these had archived my account and they recovered it once i claimed it.

Satoshi is not going to play this game. If he wanted to be famous, he will be by now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:31:10
Because they don't have them or lost access to them.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:56:01
No, i was never arrested because of Bitcoin or Silkroad. Actually, i never was or traded there. The rise and the fall of both silk roads happened while i was behind bars.

I tried to withdrawal once i left prison.  I used to exchange big money for people (without asking questions :) )  between (Liberty Reserve- Webmoney and cash) .
I was arrested with for possession of class A drugs in my car.
I found out later that one my ex(she is a redditor btw) set me up to take some money i had hidden. 
Before my arrest, i had the wallet in Megaupload, Dropbox and my usbdrive.

From the 80k, 14k are mine. The reason why they froze mine was that my account was inactive for more than 2 years. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:27:30
I will give you 5 BTC if this story end up in any newspaper and 50BTC to the widow.
Prove me wrong now.

If he is not locked behind bars for the rest of his life.
Karpeles will disappear from the scene. He will pay for some plastic surgery, he will have new ID (It cost around 2-3Keuro , to get a real one). Then he can use the fews thousand coins that he stored.  He will be never able to return as a important actor of the community, but who cares when you have millions ?

I had 14342 BTC in mtgox since 2010.  When i tried to withdraw them , they asked for verification.
 
Luckily i have more in cold storage 
and was unable to touch them until last December since i was in prison.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:03:37
When i asked MTGox for my funds after my release ( around 14KBTC) in December, they send me hell.
I could have help them now since i own around 412k BTC. 
Now it time for him to take my place in prison.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:53:34
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:21:13
You can revert a fiat transaction, you can't do that with Bitcoin.

Unless you work in the stem cell research, i don't  your services for now.
Thank you.

Yes, i just got in touch with a woman, she said that `they` are interested in investors for a new trading platform.
when i asked where she got my number, her reply was that she got a list and that her job is just to call `potential investors`.
edit: corrected typo

Patching memory is a OS related issue not bitcoin flaw.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:32:13
I don't want to setup a business for now.
These past weeks, i was thinking in investing in stem cell research.
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:06:04
No. I deposited the coins in 2010. Got arrested and account was inactive until December 2013. When i claimed my coins, they asked for verification again.
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:35:50
You forgot the part where Satoshi turn out to be a woman.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:46:11
It was worth less then 600$ at the time of deposit. Then i was unable to trade since i did not have Internet access.

Maksik was arrested in turkey after trying to sell skimmers to local hacker. The FBI just took credit .

You better keep this photo intact. Thermal paper go bad quickly. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:07:29
No. But I'm thinking in investing in this field, since it has big potential.
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:33:00
Nice :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:17:50
I was lucky enough to not die in prison. I was raped there. 
Lost the saving i had in Liberty Reserve. 
The only thing I'm proud of, is that i had a paid drop-box account with my files (including my wallet).
