I imagine it's like hitting the end of the internet.  Less than you expected.

Nice form.  This guy right here is one of the reasons I believe in crypto.  Merry Christmas to you sir!

Probably the same reason I quit buying the dips and now regularly make purchases instead.  I've been watching Bitcoin for at least 7 years and this year I decided it was real.  Just this month (maybe I'm drinking the Kool-Aid) I came to the conclusion history isn't going to repeat itself.  Bitcoin is going to 'go vertical'.  Yeah OP, it does feel good!

Dec. 12-14th.  You're welcome.

Thanks for sharing your tool!  I will play with it and give you some feedback.  Some people see hashes in the blockchain.  I see blonde, brunette, redhead...

This particular address is not what is interesting (although it is how I found it).  It is the additional unspent outputs this address is grouped with.

I'm not going to disagree with you, 20% is possible.  But what will the price be when that happens?  Consider:
Mar 24 - June 10 = +334% ~11wks
June 10 - July 15 = 39% drop ~5wks
July 15 - Sept 1 = +272%  ~6wks
Sept 1 - Sept 15 = 40% drop ~2wks
Sept 15 - Nov 5 = +265% ~7wks
Nov 5 - 8 - Nov 12 = 30% drop ~1wk
Nov 12 - ???? = +???% ~ ?wks
I sold some BTC on Nov. 4th and took a tiny bit of profit but I didn't buy in at the last dip even though I saw it coming.  By my figuring that was barely a dip.  That means this is the peak and the bubble is over and we will continue to see a gradual decline; or the formula changes and the fractal pattern we've witnessed in previous years is broken.  Dips?  We don't need dips where we are going :)

I actually believe that as well.  I'm still buying (today) and doing a bit of dollar averaging.

Personal fav on Blockchain.  I tried to search this using your tool but couldn't get a hit.

It's speculative.  I have market research that supports this but I'm just a random dude on the interwebz.  Yes, I do believe when Bitcoin gets shorted to eternity it will have a short term impact on price.

Neptune's Brood describes such a system.  In the book all money is crypto and it is classified as fast, medium, and slow (for interstellar investments).  I haven't read it myself but it sounds interesting.
