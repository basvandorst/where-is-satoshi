First, that you need to put a 3-letter acronym after the $ sign shows how ineffective using $ is.  Why even try to pretend the symbol is useful for identifying a currency if it requires a follow-up code for disambiguation purposes?
People who live in the US can (and do) go their entire lives without having to worry about encountering the symbols used in Canada, Australia, Mexico, El Salvador and many other countries.  The same is true for the residents in each of those nations - people in Australia know what $ means when they go to the store.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is supposed to work worldwide and it will be many years if it takes over from local currencies - if it ever does.  So using a symbol already in use a negative for Bitcoin.

Based on our experience, most people who have purchased bitcoins have no problem with selling them.  
As for people who have not purchased bitcoins before? Those people have a wealth of questions as to how to do this and not enough experts or ready information around to assist them.  That's probably why "buy bitcoin" shows up clearly.

Dish Networks, the San Jose Earthquakes, Tesla Motors, and Virgin Galactic would like to have a word.

The release of the upcoming NY Bitcoin regulations are going to have a much more of an impact on the community - one way or another - than the sale of less than 10 days worth of mined coins.

Bitcoin used to be accepted by nobody.
Then Bitcoin was accepted by a few individuals.
That inspired some Mom and Pop-type shops to get on board.
Which made a few "Tier 3" companies - small companies here and there - to start.
Then some "Tier 2" companies saw that they could get in the game.
I do not see a problem here.  No "Tier 1" company was likely to jump on after seeing a 10kBTC transaction for 2 pizzas or verifying that yes, one could buy Alpaca wool socks a few years ago.  Each tier wants to see the one before it show that it was a smart move for them to do so.
In the meantime, consider taking another look at TigerDirect, Overstock, and other "Tier 2" retailers who are literally doing everything you could want but are not "hot enough" for you because they are right there, right now, accepting Bitcoin.

By what metric would we judge Dogecoin to be a success?
Was it ever supposed to be a realistic alternative towards Bitcoin?  It does not appear to be so.  Bitcoin itself has enough problems towards that goal and Dogecoin has all that plus a few more.  But so what?
What if we considered Dogecoin to be the "gateway drug" towards crypto-currencies?  Having attended and co-hosted a couple of Dogecoin events (along with Bitcoin events), I have to say the spirit is much livelier at Dogecoin events.  There are far more young people, far more women, and far more people who just like the "stupid memes" and such and who are kicking around basically trivial amounts of money and are having fun with it.  And that's what Bitcoin needs if it is going to continue to grow - because these are the people who are going to help it grow further. 
It should also be pointed out that May 4th will show the "Dogecoin car" ( racing at [Talladega]( because enough Dogecoin-loving Redditors pooled $55k of their "ignorant" money together to get a full-car sponsorship.  That's a 3-hour Dogecoin ad running around to tens of thousands of people in person and millions of people on live television.  And if this car were to win?!?!  
It remains to be seen if the Reddit Bitcoin community - or the Bitcoin community at large - could come together to pull off such a great PR feat.  So instead of looking hard to see what's wrong with Dogecoin, try looking to see what's right about it.

Be honest.

This has not been settled yet - there are many strong proponents for using ฿ as the symbol and that would be a mistake as it would lead to unnecessary confusion, as illustrated in the picture.

I think one of the points that drcross was going for was that we have a lot of systems that take a long time to confirm but Bitcoin shows it right up front.  For example, the vendor who takes a Visa payment often doesn't get their money for weeks afterwards - that's a confirmation cycle that is invisible to most people.  Paypal also is "fronting" the money in many of their transactions while money is slowly moved from point to point.  This too is not as evident to the end-user.
As for you, I have no idea why you are realizing such a problem with your payment. 2 hours is a real long time to wait for a standard fee transaction and I think there could be something specific to your case happening rather than an indicator of a systemic failure of Bitcoin.

We are not talking about "the currency" as that is gender-neutral.
We talking about the community surrounding the currency - the community of meetups, conferences, here online, and so forth.  If women are not given a baseline level of respect or are taken less seriously by virtue of their gender, they will stay away and that will have a net negative impact on the currency and its propagation.

It's almost like currency banks arose and became popular for a purpose!

Using an existing currency symbol for Bitcoin is a big mistake.
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:18:11
This is a great idea!

It is not a question of if women are finding it interesting, it is a question of if they are finding a welcome reception when they show up or are they immediately considered to be second-class members of the community.

[Spelunkin]( wrote about it last week.  We are a very new publication but we try to have quality information about these and other cryptocurrency events on both coasts and in Europe and hopefully more areas as we grow.

A BTC grocery store?  Sounds like the Greene Avenue Market, run by Dan Lee!  Gotta say, Bitcoin or no, that's one of the better small grocery stores that I have ever seen.  Enjoy - and tell him we said hi!

[Spelunkin]( will be covering this event.  Expect a writeup and video!

It highlights the advantages of meeting up in a public area, in daylight, with a bunch of other people.  One-on-one meetups are not necessarily dangerous but there are safer ways to conduct a transaction.
