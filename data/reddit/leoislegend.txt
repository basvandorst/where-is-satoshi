Anyone know the best alternative to Gemini for someone from the UK? I'm using Kraken at the moment but the site is always really slow.

Time to panic sell alts and buy them back at a loss when BTC retraces.

Doesn't look like it, my KuCoin bags aren't looking so hot. KCS is now down over 50% and still dropping.

The reuters article says they will close coin exchanges "if needed". They're not going to randomly shut-down exchanges... as long as they adhere to the new regulations it'll be fine.

No. Just believe him. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:30:18
I too believe everything that is written on the internet.

Thanks for the reply. I did get an email from Revolut saying it had been executed on Monday morning but have not heard anything from gdax/coinbase since then.
I know they are busy at the moment so will maybe take a bit longer to process it. I guess it hasn't been 2 days so will not worry yet. I thought maybe it would show as processing in my account but like you say it doesn't show up until after it has been processed.... so will just keep waiting.

The statement on reuters has been updated to say it allows regulators to close down exchanges if needed... i.e. any exchanges that don't follow regulations or break the law. It's not that bad.

Lol. The price won't move much until the start of the new tax year in the US.

This is pretty common for South Korea, you have to do this to play games online... you're ID is linked to your account.

I sent a SEPA over the weekend and still hasn't showed up. I think everything is just slow with them at the moment.

80% dip would be nice.

Any thoughts on Bittrex and Bitfinex? I want to invest in other currencies. I've also heard people mentioned Kraken but the site doesn't load for me half the time.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:13:26
Yea I looked into it more and Bittrex seems to be the way to go. Mananged to get verified and transferring all coins over to it now.

"Nate told me the more money you invest the more money you will get" LOL
EDIT: no-one watched the video to the end judging by these comments.

It's hard to know which exchange to trust, bad reviews for most of them. Then being from the UK makes thing even more difficult.
I can see why other people are using hardware wallets now, if I had a lot invested I would feel a bit uncomfortable holding it on the site.

Yes everything is down. The massive sell off is over, it'll be up again next week when Coinbase allow buys.

Hindsight is 20/20. Easy to say all that now but it's not too late if you believe Bitcoin will only go up in price in the future... better late than never.
As far as other coins go it's pretty much a gamble. Diversify and invest a small amount in some moon coins. My main moon coin at the moment is ARK, I have high hopes for it in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:37:14
It'll be fine. Maybe dip before then and go back up after. I'd be more worried about the Korea news.

@_date: 2017-12-28 05:49:32
Yes get out while you still can.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:03
Only just bought some. I remember years ago researching bitcoin miners and being really interested... only wish i'd invested then. 
Kinda sad i'm this late to the party but better late than never. Gonna keep buying every month now. To the moon I guess!
