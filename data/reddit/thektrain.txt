I'm having the same problem! I deleted it a week ago then went to reinstall it and can't find it.. there is nothing on the website... are we going crazy??

I think that’s exactly how this stuff gets decided. someone with a unique idea just starts using it.
We don’t need to wait for Apple to design one for us. I love the creativity.

Lol 2% of all energy consumption is MASSIVE. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:35:07
Ah, I was reading it as if you were saying bitcoin would replace banking. I understand what you’re saying now. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:45:21
Mmm think I’ll criticize bitcoin for this
@_date: 2019-03-10 17:40:50
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:26:41
You’re the one talking about bitcoin and banking as if their energy use should be compared. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:58:31
Bitcoin won’t replace banking.

This is your investment guru. Serious question: Are you retarded?
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:47:37
I figured it out. It’s called coins live now in the App Store 
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:53:58

I mean how many of these articles have we seen.. ya know? They are only posted because everyone in this sub has a vested interest in this being the case.

Because automating certain interactions will save companies a ton of money. Smartcontracts makes that possible. 
It will mostly be for ‘unsexy’  back-end stuff but it’s coming and will be huge.
Imagine using a DocuSign contract and as soon as you ‘click sign’ your name, the order is purchased, the funds are delivered, the receipt is uploaded, the goods are available, the order is tracked, etc etc. 
That’s one narrow instance. I’m on mobile,  but think of a self driving car that can pay for its own maintenance, and buy more cars on its own when it gets enough money -this is futuristic and ambiguous stuff but smart contracts are going to start disrupting things.

It’s not fast..
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:37:30
The majority of alts and btc don’t compete at all. This lighting upgrade won’t make them ‘obsolete’
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:32:52
Yes but not faster checking out than a credit card.  
And yes I understand that credit cards are not instantaneous, but for a customer checking out at a store it effectively is. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:25:39
No Alts? Hm. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:24:29
No private chains are not, by design.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:41:19
No you don’t need a blockchain to automate them, but to automate them in a secure, trust-less way without a centralized escrow, you do need blockchain. That’s the whole point. 
Without blockchain, yes you can set up an automatic payment. But that goes through a bank, ACH, a credit card company etc and takes time and money. 
Without blockchain, yes you can automate the various things above as long as there is some kind of centralized oversight. Blockchain removes the need for that oversight and therefore should eventually offer a cheaper, faster, more secure solution. 
The tech is getting close. I think the savings will be small, but when done on a large scale will be massive.

That’s basically saying that with an upgrade bitcoin could possibly have the same functionality as Ethereum. I don’t see how that kills every alt. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:35:32
Yes, Bitcoin was the first. That doesn’t mean it’s the last. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:39:14
True, 99% are crap.
Everything but the ones I own of course ;)
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:07:55
There isn’t more friction on the back end. Think about how complicated and costly it is for an actual credit card transaction to come through. 
There is currently friction, but the process is rapidly becoming more simplified. And when it’s fully adopted it will have significantly less friction than the way things are currently done.
@_date: 2019-01-12 05:04:11
With your credit card?
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:09:25
There are private and permissioned blockchains that give the companies the control they want while also leveraging the benefits of decentralization and immutability.  Companies are definitely already on their way to doing it. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:48:33
Isn’t that susceptible to abuse? If there are no confirmations?
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:39:02
Smart contracts will be huge
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:14:23
I don’t think you’ve don’t much research into the breadth of services the 2000 other alts aim to provide. Blockchain is a lot more than just the out-of-the-box payment functionality that bitcoin offers.  I guess we’ll see who is right
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:58:11
Can anyone explain why you would use one of them? I don’t get it. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:22:25
But why? I don’t think these have any point.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:42:46
It is the same experience for the buyer, but is quite different on the back-end. 
The savings and differences will be to business, not directly to the consumer. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:22:42
Thank you
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:30:43
Paying with dollars at a checkout is instantaneous..
If I have to wait for 5 minutes while my BTC gets enough confirmations to leave the register, it’s not quick enough dude. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:28:02
I have moved BTC many times, and it’s not instant.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:01:29
Btc isn’t instant. At all. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:42:53
It isn’t instant for BTC though if you need to wait for confirmations for it to go through..
I understand credit cards are not technically instant with how they are reconciled, but as far as time at the register goes, they are. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:35:11
If I pay cash for an item, it’s instant. You are retarded. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:27:35
How long do you have to sit at the register for while this shit clears?
