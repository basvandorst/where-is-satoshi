Yeah you my want to hedge your position with some futures contract every now and then. Take the profits and buy more bitcoin.

Yeah I was making a joke. Look at the title, look what I said.

Bruh, BTC Futures are cash settled they don’t effect the price of bitcoin directly

Wall Street is going to Annihilate the price of Bitcoin, because you might want to post this in Korean. These people are literally insane. This is genuinely tulip mania. But it’s 1999 not 2001.

That’s a good point anyhow. These valuations will crash hard though. But Bitcoin cash because people for some reason this that’s a hedge against Bitcoin. This market is all Behavioral.

The idea is that gold is inversely proportional to equities, it’s used as a hedge. Bitcoin could arguably evolve into a store of value similar to gold as it becomes more correlated with the world economy. However the opposite can be argued too. Because all year Bitcoin has been increasing along with the stock market.

Yup miners with poor margins allocate hash power elsewhere to Litecoin, Monero, BCASH(Yeah I called it that Roger����), etc.
