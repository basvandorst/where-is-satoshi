He said earlier it was his kids being born
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:45:16
Yeah I’m trying to find a way to sell it from a different method
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:48:14
Is quadriga a good site to buy and sell? I looked at coinbase but since im in Canada I would not be able to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:08:05
Yeah that is what we are gonna do, he is the one that is gonna put the $10 in for me anyways since he wants me to learn how to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:29
Ah ok, I will look around then.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:16
Will keep this in mind, also how do I buy BTC from bread?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:59:52
how would I go about getting a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:46:17
Should I wait before buying or is right now a good time?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:55:28
Also one more question, I tried to put in $10 on Quadriga but it says there is a minimum of $50 deposit. Are there any other good sites that I could use that do not have a minimum and that work in Canada?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:27
will check it out thanks
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:39:52
How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:59:02
awesome, will check bread out. seems extremely convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:05:37
could I make it under my dad's name but I could just monitor the account for him? I will try bitstamp since coinbase does not work in canada.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:44:43
Can I send it to Gdax for free first then send it to quadriga? Cause t costs 18$ from coinbase to quadriga
