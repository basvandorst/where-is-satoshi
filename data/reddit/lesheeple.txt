Capacity increase was needed yesterday, not in 2018. That's why everyone really wants 2mb hard fork ASAP, and not more SW/LN promises.

As opposed to Ethereum which is totally finished. /s

Trolls are coming?
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:25:24
Sounds like you are the salty one. Let me guess, you are a small blocker and you are running out of arguments.
@_date: 2015-08-14 02:11:51
Miners alone can't control the network, so you are wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:14:50
Right, but in the case of a hard fork, you don't choose the best (by hashing power) chain, just the one you consider valid. For instance, if 51% of the hashing power follows a chain that creates more than 21m coins, no one (no merchants, full-nodes, or savers) is going to consider it valid.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:30:47
You are putting too much weight into mining. Miners don't own the Bitcoin network. The economic majority does. Eg: What good is having "51%", if no one accepts the coin?
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:42:22


The word is "redundant".
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:09:44
Coins can be exchanged for goods and services.
My point was that the danger of forks for users isn't spending, but being paid.
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:36:33
Because cognitive dissonance. Theymos suffers the same disease.
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:42:24
I find it even funnier that some people here, who know big corporations and governments take us to war and destroy entire nations for profit, would never *ever* do something crazy like hiring trolls to sway public opinion in their favour.
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:11:39
As opposed to dismissing a great article simply by calling the author "salty"?
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:16:06
I'm thinking maybe all the videos I've seen avoided being explicit about there being no hope for us, because that's a hard sell. Why will people fight if there is no reward? Watching governments go down might not be enough for many. Imagine if we could find the perfect phrasing, or some sort of incredible (but true) promise that catches like wildfire among the modern slaves, like Christianity did among chains slaves. Maybe eternal biological/cyborg life? Though it seems too far away at the current levels of investment in science. Don't mind me, I'm going to sleep now.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:34:30
I feel like each country is just a different experiment to see how to tune the variables for the slaves, to maximize their productivity and the profit for their masters.
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:16:00
Ahh right, economics. The government-sponsored "science" where we are taught everything banks do is for a reason and good for the economy. "Don't ever use a fixed supply currencies, they are evil and will bring deflationary spirals of death. Just trust us."

Honey Badger doesn't care.
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:26:43
What does that have to do with anything? Putin wasn't in charge during the cold war, and communism doesn't necessarily take you to war.
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:12:49


Nice try, Matrix.
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:50:29
What do you do or recommend them doing to fight the state? What could the Greek people have done? Remember that humans aren't good at spontaneously working as a group (tragedy of the commons), and violent revolutions typically only work when people are starving or something like that.

So he's like every other politician?

Nick Szabo is not Satoshi. Proof: Satoshi would never use Twitter.

Please stop calling us "geeks". It's just a word for idiots who love iPhones and using weird glasses, but actually don't know shit.

He's being racist towards the human race.
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:26:46
I'm longing for that day. When he becomes the richest person ever, he will be able to put honest and competent people in charge of every country.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:15:40


Safety is relative. The sooner you learn this, the better. Zero-confirmation transactions can be safe, just like one-confirmation transactions can be safe, depending on the context. Eg: If you are selling candy, 1 conf is overkill. If you are selling a house, 1 conf is not enough.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:02:05
So your argument is calling everyone an ignorant. Got it.

Somalia has had many governments, and that only made it worse. But statists always use it to create the false dichotomy of "either you have a government, or you end up like Somalia".
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:04:47
You miss the full nodes. Besides, the network is not just computers, it's also humans with economic incentives. If the network is attacked, it will adapt.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:22:59


You mean like when people get downvoted and attacked for disagreeing about the government being a force of good that saved humanity from not having roads?

In 1700 it was indians.

PGP is just an algorithm, and I agree it's complicated. But using it (which is up to email client developers) isn't any more difficult than any other computer algorithm. By your logic Bitcoin will never work because creating a transaction, signing it, and publishing it is hard.
If you believe people won't use anything other than web clients (which might be true), then why bother with PGP? The government will read all their emails anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:38:17
For me it's hard to conceptualize how you can think that a system where suddenly the poor (and everyone else) can not only save but also get a cut of the economic growth is worse than a system where the ruling elite can steal from everyone else simply by printing more money.

I haven't said he isn't a tyrant, and I know his past. You guys are getting emotional for some reason.

You can't use a word to define itself. If you knew this sort of thing you wouldn't have to get a job as an establishment troll.
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:45:03
I mentioned the Greeks because you did first, and also because I wanted a direct, practical answer, and not just the classic "when you realize you are a slave, you will be free (by magic)".
What I'm realizing at this point is that not only are we slaves, but also no one knows how to actually stop being one.
I'm glad to hear the things you do to try not to be a slave, but the true answer seems to be that through education we might or might not free future generations (not ourselves).

I wish this person the best, but I'm not going to donate money to the US legal system, and to be honest I don't even believe there is hope for someone in such a situation. That country is messed up.
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:01:42
Good to know.
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:14:19
Beautiful family, congrats.

No. Your coins are in both chains, so you can spend them in both.

If it's for savings then spend $100-$200 on a hardware wallet or a cheap notebook for cold storage (install everything you need and then disable the networking, or just install with a fresh Tails DVD).
Or make her a paper wallet, and let her keep the address in the PC.

That's a problem with email clients, not pgp.

And Obama won the Nobel peace prize, so that should give you all an idea.
