what was the result of this attack? please eli5 for someone non-technical

Hello old friend
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:44:14
Gotcha, I reread it and I see what you mean. I think I'd still want to get more insight into that number because $11m seems quite high. 
Subtracting the digital asset losses brings them to negative $3m, and you have to believe that the 'project costs' will not be ongoing forever. Obviously like any other crypto company they are market dependent, but I don't think that it's fair to say they are lying to people. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:32:26
I've got some bad news for you...

Probably hates it his company does not have the majority of the hashrate

It means shitcoins are getting eradicated. Btc can also gain dominance while increasing in value, it just typically doesn't 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:12:40
Lots of people don't want a Bitcoin ETF anymore, but the ability to invest inside a registered account will be a big benefit for a lot of people. 
This will also help reduce volatility, as people buying a Bitcoin ETF are more likely to hodl long term.
We do not **need** a Bitcoin ETF, but I don't think dismissing the idea is a good idea. This type of thing will only help increase exposure and awareness. 
Bitcoin will never grow perfectly without government involvement, so I think we should embrace that the SEC and other major regulators are making decisions on it. Better to get them in now before Schnorr, Bulletproofs, etc are implemented. Eventually Bitcoin will be anonymous and it will be too late for the government to stop it.

I'm not sure you're right about that.. do you have a breakdown you can find of what was depreciated?
I read that they did factor in depreciation of coins somewhere.
Like I said, the cost to mine 1 coin is the reason I like them. At the end of the day if they can keep that cost reasonably low then they have a good business regardless of asset depreciation (besides coins).
@_date: 2018-09-27 18:44:52
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:34:07
This is factoring depreciation on their current store of coins though, no? I believe the depreciation is also assessed on the equipment they are using.
This wouldn't affect the profit margin on newly minted coins, only on previously mined coins. 
I could be wrong overall, but if Bitcoin price had remained even they would have been insanely profitable.
Their EBITDA is great, and I feel like with the volatility of Bitcoin this is the metric that's most important for a mining operation. Their balance sheet will swing dramatically, sometimes by 10-15% a day due to market volatility.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:49:40
I don't think this stuff even needs to be mentioned, it's obvious. BCH might have its own contentious hard fork soon. It's clear that it will not be a chain that retains nearly as much value as BTC
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:49:00
Interesting, thanks for the response! Has a ddos attack been successful for stealing LN funds that we know of yet, or can they just temporarily crash a node?
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:09:48
This is a good summary
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:10:28
For those of us that weren't here, what happened around the last halving?
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:10:57
Correct. You can basically sign the block and even put a message in it.
Back when Segwit2x was a thing many pools were signaling NYA (New York Agreement) and some were putting NO2X
@_date: 2019-03-15 03:39:57
Pretty sure this is terrible for the people of Venezuela. 
We all want crypto to grow but let’s not wish for others misfortune to make it happen lol

He doesn’t have to do anything at all, I think four developers is monumental.
Bitcoin functions well with slow development anyways, because there can’t be any errors. If he paid for say 100 devs now you’re talking about an entire organization, rather than a group of decentralized contributors.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:27:53
What sort of active monitoring or participation is required by each signatory? Like in simple terms, other than using the network, what do they actually do to maintain its integrity?
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:46:09
This makes a lot of sense. You can't say you don't trust exchanges but then do exchange to exchange transfers anyways... if liquid speeds this up I don't see how this would affect anyone's Utopian view of Bitcoin.
If you want control of your keys, send them to your own wallet. If you don't trust an exchange, buy p2p. Liquid changes none of this.
The one thing it might be able to help it seems is reduce spreads in developing countries that actually need Bitcoin, provided that their exchanges get on Liquid. 
The kill switch to this whole network would be that any of the exchanges collude and steal funds. If this happened then they would be killing their business anyways.
I'm sure there are negatives to Liquid, but I don't see them at first glance..
Edit: To add to this, Liquid would always have to be faster and cheaper for users or else they won't use it. It's not like the companies that are watching the network would be able to create a system where they gouge users for transaction fees.

Same way you build a house, one brick at a time. You thought this shit was going to be easy?
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:36:58
You can hardly tell what the machine is, they should really put a sign there or something 
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:11:11
Bitcoin has it's lowest trading volume since July 2017. Typically this means a breakout of some sort is coming.
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:10:32
That makes sense, really appreciate the insight 
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:18:31
At what point do you think routing fees will make running a node profitable?
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:57:15
That's awesome, will dig into this soon! Appreciate the response 
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:07:29
This is a great question, and the Bitcoin community will have to come together to fight against this sort of thing from happening.
If there's one thing I feel confident in, it's that even the BCH side of the argument will put their swords away to fight against the banks/institutions on this sort of thing. 
One thing I can say confidently is that people don't buy Bitcoin unless they understand it. In my eyes you can't understand Bitcoin without understanding that banks/institutions can't be allowed to force their overly restrictive rules on it. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:38:10
Awesome man thanks for the answers! A couple of follow ups if you don't mind:


Will each exchange have to configure this, or will the L-BTC format be invalid as far as the Bitcoin network is concerned?


This sounds really clever, so the users of Liquid essentially share a trust account and central liquidity source they can all pull from?
One last question, since you seem like you know what you're talking about - what are the potential pitfalls/negatives, and what are the other advantages nobody is talking about re:Liquid?
@_date: 2018-10-06 03:08:20
It will make sense for these merchants to offer discounts to pay with LN BTC payments as well. 
If Moneris or whoever your credit card terminal runs through is taking 2-4% then splitting that and passing savings on to the customer create a win-win.
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:10:08
Is Halong and Dragonmint not dead?
@_date: 2018-10-06 03:05:08
Some exchanges, BTM's, and older wallets still don't use SegWit.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:01:34
I have some questions re: the functionality of Liquid, hopefully someone can help.
From the Blockstream site:


If a CT address is generated for me from let's say Bitfinex, and I am on an exchange that is not part of the Liquid network what will happen if I send funds to this address? I'm wondering if users would have to differentiate between sending over the blockchain, and over Liquid. 
Another question - how does a recipient exchange move funds that they've received from a sending exchange through Liquid? 
Let's say one exchange sends 100 L-BTC to another through Liquid, and now the recipient exchange needs to send those funds over the blockchain to a customer of theirs that wishes to make a withdrawal. Is it necessary for the recipient exchange to be in possession of at least 100 BTC to complete the trade? When and how does settlement happen on the Bitcoin blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:13:04
I have never trusted Bitfinex or USDT. Hopefully I'm wrong, but in the future we might reminisce on how foolish everyone was for trusting them.
If Finex is really a bad actor and insolvent then they will die eventually, I'd prefer it happens sooner than later so we can move on.
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:01:31
Yeah just do this. You have about 10-30 minutes until your transaction is confirmed on the blockchain in which it's realistic to panic. Once your transaction is confirmed a few times you have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:42:26
I'm not technical so I can't answer this, but if someone can please tag me on the response - would like to know the answer as well.
From what I understand, the transactions happen between two parties on Liquid and the amounts are obscured - aka anonymous. I wonder if this factors in to the answer of your question...
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:42:21
Could be bears getting exhausted. 
Likely the general public is losing interest because there is no price movement. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:33:41
I'm very intrigued. I have interest in setting up a Bitcoin + Lightning node and creating some payment channels on main net. 
Would love to see more tutorials of how to run Lightning through this interface and how to set up channels. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:37:29
Liquid seems sick, Lightning keeps picking up momentum, and institutional buyers keep gaining new avenues to enter the market.
Who cares about the price, Bitcoin is becoming stronger by the day. It's becoming more usable, and the next halvening is getting closer - prices will rise again eventually.
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:16:50
BitMex is the fucking Wild West, buckle up if you want to play around in that market. They won't exist in their current format in a couple of years.
Be patient, better companies come as adoption increases.

This is automated I take it?

Go read about their main investor if that’s not exciting enough - Omar Dhanani/Michael Patryn

I would like to know as well, please tag me if you respond to this

Probably not, BCH doesn't seem to move the broader market this substantially. 
Not sure what today's dump is caused by, although some people think USD prices or the DOW

Guy who makes product predicts that his product could be really successful
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:46:04
That's the technical analysis I come here for 
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:49:13
Gotcha. So hashrate falling is overall a good thing because it increases reward for miners still mining, although theoretically the network could get choked if hashrate drops too far.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:47:36
Two retards throwing mud. Nobody wins because they're both covered in mud by the end of it.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:20:12
Doesn’t hashrate adjust based on number of blocks mined, not time elapsed?
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:53:56
That's not necessarily a bad thing. You got a link to an article?
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:17:47
There's only so much more despair possible from this point. Not that dick-eating was keeping the price up, but what if anything could possibly come out about Bitcoin news-wise at this point that would set the price back?
There's definitely blood in the streets alright.
