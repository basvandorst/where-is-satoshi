The moon has rovers on it, what would be a bit more interesting is if we launched it away from the earth at a reasonable speed. So maybe it leaves the solar system in 100 years, make the trajectory public knowledge. Boom

Tbh I'm not sure how humans encode mathematical concepts and whether thought and human imagination works in discrete or continuous terms. I can imagine an infinite number, but does that mean I'm imaging a continuous number or just its discrete representation. I'm of the opinion that human minds are discrete just like computers are, because I just tried imagining infinity and couldn't do it properly. And the fact that our memory is likely limited, and the human brain is finite both lend towards our brains being discrete. So really, nothing in the world can properly encode a continuous number, but given that numbers are used as representations of real life phenomena, I can encode 1/3 by slicing a cake perfectly into 3 pieces. Wow, that was an interesting rabbit hole.

He's actually right in a way, computers can't "do" regular (continuous) mathematics, thats why CS majors all have to learn discrete mathematics. While a computer can never know exactly what 1/3 is, it can pretty actually approximate if you have enough memory. His math != the math that a computer can do

The point that the professor was making was that a computer could never understand what 1/3 truly is. As the computer is a discrete machine it can make a functional approximation like a object Rational( "numerator": int, "denominator": int), but the point still stands that this is a discrete representation and not the actual number. "Real" mathematics that is continuous doesn't work on computers, that CS 101
