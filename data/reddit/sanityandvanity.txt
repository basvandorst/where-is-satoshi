Hi, yeah it requires python3, I've only been testing in 3.6 so far. Try
    sudo pip uninstall cryptop
    sudo pip3 install cryptop
If you're still having issues let me know what these output
    python --version
    python3 --version

After the flattering reception to cryptop's announcement, I thought you guys might enjoy a heads up on improvements.
Thanks for using cryptop
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:14:55
No worries, thanks for using cryptop. And for the gold!
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:30:58
In the .ini in ~/.cryptop you can set currency

Message me what you're trying to do and I'll take a look

I need them to buy rocket fuel 
You're welcome, thanks for checking it out

Uses the cryptocompare.com api, which is a quickly updating aggregate of lots of exchanges.
Different apis would use different request patterns, so how difficult it is to modify would depend on how big a difference and how comfortable you are with Python.

Yep, I've got a pull request with this waiting I need to vet, should be available today sometime
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:28:15
And then coins like GBYTE. Supports 2-5 now, which I think covers all cases.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:52:27
Thanks man, I'm learning a lot reading your PRs, I'll try get them merged in today.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:32:39
Because I didn't consider coins with symbols other than 3 characters, I'll fix this today
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:49:30

Not my actual holdings, but I try to consider shitcoin purchases as learning experiences.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:02:59
I accidentally overlooked long coin symbols, I'll fix it tomorrow
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:28:25
I just released the update that supports other currencies, there's an .ini file in the .cryptop directory lets you change it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:31:32
I'll work on this today
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:21:45
Thank you
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:11:06
Hi, support for other currencies is in place now, you will have to re-enter your holdings unfortunately
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:16:54
Updates automatically from the cryptocompare.com api as quickly as the request completes, typically every few seconds.

    Redditor for a day
It's a shill for BCC
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:51:22
The ini contains the colour and request settings (fiat currency and update interval), the holdings have been converted to a json formatted file requiring re-entry, sorry
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:34:06
Yeah something to do with the mobile preview of rst files, I'll have a look at it
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:30:57
It allows you to query multiple coins in a single request, and I liked the idea of a rapidly updating aggregate.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:39:39
I'm adding support for other currencies today, check back soon
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:49:38
TIL thanks, I don't think I'll include support for it but I'll let people know it's an option
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:45:58
I would make a website that takes better advantage of web UI frameworks than trying to use a terminal interface. This uses pretty low level libraries which wouldn't translate well to the modern web, but you could easily achieve a similar looking site in most languages.

You need python 3 and pip installed on a Unix based distro, Windows doesn't support the Python Curses library. Then you follow the instructions on the GitHub readme, shoot me a DM if you're having issues.

It uses the cryptocompare.com API, which averages about twenty exchanges
