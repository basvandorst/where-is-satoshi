I think Coinbase/GDAX is doing it on purpose. Coinbase want you to pay the fee because they know it will dissuade you from doing the withdrawal. Coinbase knows people want to buy Ripple and are upset that they listed Btrash first instead of Ripple. 
Around 3 pm today, XRP was around $2.00, I said I am going to wait for a correction. Now it is over $2.80. I figure by time Gdax fix the issue + the time it times to process and transfer, XRP would go up, so instead of withdrawing from GDAX, I withdrewed from Coinbase and paid the fee.
Can't miss my ticket to the moon because of Coinbase have sour grapes.

In Coinbase there are 5 wallets (BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, USD). I had money in my USD wallet. I purchased some BTC on Coinbase which transaction occurred instantaneously.
Next I clicked on the Account link in the horizontal Navigation Bar (I am on a desktop PC). Lastly, I clicked send on the BTC wallet. I was able to put in the address of the exchange I wanted to transfer the BTC to.
Again, I had to this because of the GDAX errors. I read comments where it stated, open Gdax on your cellphone and it may work. Doesn't hurt to try that option first to avoid the fees but I have XRP but I need to buy more. FOMO.
The transaction is still pending. While waiting rippled dropped from $2.80 to $2.44 on coinmarketcap, so I am not too upset, however, the BTC value is dropping as well which have me concern that by time the transfer occurs, my BTC would be down by 1/4 of it's original value.
But that's crypto for ya, volatility like a mofo.
