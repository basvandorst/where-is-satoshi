I actually built it months ago, but never actually shared publicly due to lack of SSL on the server. I then got busy with some other problems in my main job, so got no time left to look for how to resolve the SSL problem, add a Terms of Use section and publish it.
The idea is to register and have your address aliased by your username (both in the page and as a webservice), like in:

Best taxes I found so far to buy with CC is Simplex.

Yes, BCH refers to "Bitcoin Cash". It's a different coin than Bitcoin's.

Usually credit card is one of the most expensive ways to buy crypto. There are some websites where you can do that, like Simplex, Paxful, Coinmama, etc. But don't expect getting much less than paying around 10% in spread and taxes.

Looks like the mempool is a bit crowded today. Have you checked Bitcoin Fees? It's a good reference to know which fee has best ROI when you need to send transactions on Bitcoin

You acquired it for spending, so do it. So if you're not an investor and don't know if it would be a good idea to hold, then probably it's a bad idea.
Bitcoin was created to be spent, not held.

It looks like the cheapest route the application done on lightning costs as much as 100% of the amount you want to send. However, the max fee cost configured in the software is up to 3% of the transaction value. And as it does overflows the fee limit, the transaction fails.

My experience with this market tells me that different countries/regions have different solutions.
For example, I'm from Brazil and there are some companies testing letting you receive payments in bitcoins online and in the card payments processing machines, but at the end they will pay you directly with Fiat instead. However this only works here, as it's tied to the local currency.
