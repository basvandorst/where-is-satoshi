Probably around 350 khash/s on scrypt. Last year up until around november it was still
very profitable

it is still profitable definitely, just not as much as it was like 2-3 months ago.

fast to use? confirmations take quite a while. Also I live in a country with a working currency, what is the advantage of btc?

Ummmm people do rip into new users who make no attempt to learn on their own. ex: "How to bitcoin??????" or "How much will i make mining?? :))"
this person has clearly read the resources and done some learning on their own, and is just double checking what he has done. People are more tolerant of resourceful users

whats wrong with mtgox? sorry i am new to btc and this is the first time i have heard this sentiment

thats my point though. What is the benefit of having services only obtainable with bitcoin? As it stands, companies are adopting bitcoin because it opens them up to other potential customers (people who want to pay with btc). Companies will not willingly shut out potential customers by refusing to accept payment in ways that have already been established and are used heavily, unless of course they are selling illegal things in which they will only use bitcoin because of its more "anonymous" nature, which is why we see blackmarket vendors being the only bitcoin exclusive ones.

All currencies have a price. None are independent of each other. If I can buy an apple for 2 dollars or 1 euro, this means the price of 1 euro is 2 dollars. Same will always go for bitcoin, and I do not see how a completely closed ecosystem of btc will ever work as vendors will always want to accept more payment options to increase there customer base, just as they do now by accepting bitcoin.
