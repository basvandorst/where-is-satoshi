Please update the outdated chart

Dude, everyone buys bitcoin for price action.  You’re telling me if you invest 1000 bucks at this and it went to 1 buck, you’d be ok because you believe in the tech?
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:29:18
Are you serious?  Have you even read the white paper or seen the hundreds of written comments from Satoshi when he created Bitcoin. ?(Not Bitcoin Core or what other name you guys seem to add)
Roger is the greatest manipulator of all time.  Even Satoshi didn’t foresee Roger manipulating the masses when he bought the bitcoin.com domain.   
Btrash is what has brought corruption to the cryptospace and its naïve followers like you that keep spreading this FUD.

Lol!  Yes.  Absolutely!  :)

If it breaks, God help us all.

Loved it!

I’ve always wondered the same.  It’s impossible that exchanges are able to trade this much BTC.  Sometimes I wonder if it’s made up.  It just doesn’t add up let alone several million coins are lost....
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:18:31
Awesome share.  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:03:34
I was so excited for this app but unfortunately I don’t think most US citizens will have full functionality.  I’m not promoting Circle Invest, but it came out about the same time, and I was able to move 10k into the app immediately.
So I do think it’s a US thing.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:47:10
When anyone provides a credit card, drivers license, social security number, AND you’re trying to open a bank account or credit card - YOU will always be informed if you are denied or approved and why.  
You don’t work in the finance industry. I do.  You are required by law to inform an individual IF they can’t use a financial service when your social security number is provided.  
You should receive the reasons in mail or email.  That’s the point of providing your social security number.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:41:43
Yes.  You can buy and sell on the app.  Very easy to use.  You can also withdrawal funds to other wallets.  You can’t, however, deposit BTC in the square wallet yet.
I’ve been using it for a few weeks now.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:16:15
Then what can I do to prove my innocence?  I will provide the information or details/references you need.  It’s really annoying that I’m approved with every exchange but Abra?  What is different this go?  Is it because I make too much money?  Not enough money?  Live in the US?  It’s just very frustrating.
For example - let’s say there is a wonderful restaurant you’d like to visit.  When you get there you put your name on the register and tell them how excited you are to dine with them.  2 hours later they inform you that they can’t serve you “for undisclosed and confidential reasons.” 
You may not think this is the same thing - but in reality it is...  I’m a good faithful citizen of the US.  What is it that you feel make me unworthy of accessing Abra?
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:47:04
Unfortunately, not now.  Soon though.  I’ve purchased from Square and have moved them to my Ledger Wallet.  I don’t like my coins on line.
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:57:29
You know this Ryan guy will have to respond to his boss and say there is discord.  Call me!!  You have my number!  I’m legit!!   What did I do to be rejected!  
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:15:27
I don’t use Coinbase.  Why in the world would anyone use Coinbase...?!?
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:59:56
And maybe because I work with affluent individuals (over a billion in assets) they don’t want me to talk crypto....
Abra is a joke
“Oh now...  this guy makes more the 500k a year.  We don’t want him to add more money into crypto.  And, we can’t tell him why he can’t add.  This individual is a bad dude because we said so....”
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:55:38
I’m not sure about this app Ryan.  I have no debt.  Make great income.  I have 7 of my friends declined.  I would not suggest folks use this app.  They will reject you and they will have your social, credit card, and bank info.
Minimums a just 1k.  2k if you send them your license (which I did then somehow they cancelled my bank transfers).  400 bucks in the credit card.
I wouldn’t use this app.  All it takes is someone hacking and taking personal info.
Stay away.  Fraud potential.
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:47:43
That’s the issue!!  What are the security flaws!?  You want me to advocate your cause!  What have I done incorrectly?  What did my wife do?  What did my brother do?  What did his wife do?  What about my 7 other friends.... what did they do?  
What is going on?!?  
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:43:21
It’s not FUD.  
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:41:28
Retail banks don’t deny applications.  Are you in the US?  You can access and bank and set up an account 24/7. 
For Crypto it’s impossible to add money to this space!!  
I work in finance and oversee over 1Billion in assets.  I guarantee non of my clients are able to add into Crypto because of apps like Abra.  They shut you down even when they have millions to deposit into this app.  
It’s crazy!
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:38:55
I needed to see this today!  So true!!
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:43:01
Happened to me too!  They denied me for no reason.  They also denied my wife.  They denied my brother and his wife.  How do you explain this? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:34:34
Oh man, if the crypto market was doing better, it would have a very positive impact but right now I’m way off the reservation.  This is not normal.  20 hours a day staring at these markets.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:51:35
So the Abra representative asked me to share my number for both my wife and I (we were declined as well as 7 of my friends) and he mentioned “he can’t disclose why we were declined.”
For now, I think this is not looking good.  For all those adding their personal information - don’t do it.  Too many people being rejected.  They will have your credit card number, social, and bank info.  Recipe for disaster. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:55:34
I hope not.  I’m financially sound with no credit or legal issues.  Same with my wife and my brother and his wife.  There has to be at least one of us they approve....?  I’ve asked a few friends to register to see if it’s the same issue so I’ll know more in a few days once they sign up but on the surface it’s very fishy.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:44:20
Get over it!?  I represent millions of dollars.  How are we supposed to help the masses enter crypto when apps like Abra shut them down?! 
Come on, man.  Be sensible.  
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:42:44
Not FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:52:55
You know what else is interesting?  I was promised that I would be asked for more information via email to establish my account.  Nothing ever came.  Same for my wife.  Same for my brother and his wife.  Same for all my other friends.
Here is what is “promised” from Abra:  We may need to validate additional information on your wallet. If this is the case, you will receive an email from us outlining what documents are needed and how to go about submitting them in the next 1-3 business days. We typically review and let you know the results of this validation process within 1-2 business days. 
I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING!
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:53:36
Prove to me and to our community why Abra rejects me, my wife, or my several friends.  I’ve given you my information.  Please tell the community why you can’t approve me or several others....
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:54:49
I’m totally addicted.  I spend all my money on it.
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:50:51
I couldn’t agree more!  Nice work Drygord!  
Fraud!!  Abra is a fraud!!  
Here are my demographics:
-over 35 years old
-make 400k yearly
-no debt
-have significant assets
I guess I’m not attractive enough.  Better to use Circle Invest or some other mobile app that doesn’t restrict you.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:38:26
Have the trustee open and account at Coinbase.  They can approve him for large deposits and withdrawals greater than 100k weekly.
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:16:56
The problem is everyone I know is restricted and you have security reasons why we can’t use the app?  I have no record.  Never been arrested.  Files my tax returns.  Have a home paid for.  Have no debt.  What are your security protocols that would cause someone with over 800 credit score not qualify?
Again, I’m not the only one with this problem.  This is not just a few people with this issue.
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:44:45
Well what are the security protocols?!?  That’s the issue?!?  No one know!!
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:01:37
I agree.  Jack is all for Crypto!!  He will help move our vision forward.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:04:31

So sick of hearing that Bitcoin is bitcoin core.  
I’m going to fork bitcoin cash and my coin will be called “Bitcoin is cash”.  I’ll have the same logo and make it a softer orange.
Then I’m going to call bitcoin cash as bitcoin cash core and show how worthless bitcoin cash core is to the industry and that my coin, bitcoin is cash, is truly Satoshi’s vision.  
I’m then going to purchase bitcoin.net and make a twitter feed as   I’m going to set up my website so they can purchase Bitcoin is cash but make them think they are actually purchasing Bitcoin cash core.
Then I’m going to manipulate the market and the price so my fellow coiners feel they purchased satoshi’s true vision.
Can’t wait!

I sent them an email and stated that I needed their help as my card continues to be declined but there is cash in your account.  No matter what you do, it comes up as declined.  Can you please refresh the settings so that we can attempt to send cash again....
Something like that...

I believe it was payment or cancelled payment.  The support feature will be within the Cash app.

Since you purchased it.  You’re on the hook.  You can gift up to 15k to each kid (or 30k if you’re married) yearly.  If you gift 15k (30k), the gains transfer with the basis.  They will be on the hook for the gains once they sell.
If you need to gift more, you can use your 11.2m Federal exception but then you’ll need to file a gift tax return.

I’ve used it for quick access to the crypto markets when my limits have been reached.  Biggest issue is when you sell.  Most of my LTCs I bought at 117.  I sold at 150 but showed a 7$ decrease in value when I sold so 143.  That was the profit they took.  I still can’t believe how much they took off for the trade.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:36:23
I had the same problem so I contacted support and had them reset my setting.  I’m not sure what that does but later that day I was able to transfer the max of 2500.  You can only transfer 2500 a week into the app.
