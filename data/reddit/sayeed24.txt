Yes, hang me up each time around 20 minutes even 40 minutes, no reply from other part. I'm not from USA so it costly to call in USA. But tried several times.

Everyone who have faced situation like me all thought that they will get support if they fall same type of situation but when they fall in this issue they realized that like me. I pray for all who didn't face this type of situation.

First of all, try to skip or do not try to use Coinbase API for accepting payments because if you do then you have to suffer. There are some other good API's out there and they are working nicely. You can even use [Cryptonator]( Hope it'll be nice experience. They allow top coins and allow you to exchange from one coin to another instantly.
