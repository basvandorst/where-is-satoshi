Although I'd love to trade my meaningless internet points for meaningful internet points, I can't imagine anyone bankrolling that.

I'm not going to lie, I totally thought the two were related in some way. 
Edit: Thanks for the gold!

I'm late, but here.

Damnit. I was five letters away. Congrats!

I came across this from I've thought about giving bitcoin a go for awhile, but I have a few concerns. 
I've seen posts talking about how people have had coins stolen from them. I recall someone here writing a script that trolled around looking for security flaws or risks or something, and if the person missing coins could prove that it was actually theirs he'd give them back. I've probably explained this terribly.
My questions are, how often does that happen and how easy is it to avoid?

Thanks!

When someone gives you something, you thank them for it. It doesn't matter how big or small. It's the polite thing to do.
Then again, not begging in the first place would have also been the polite thing to do, so I guess it's to be expected.

What does adding "private" to the end of the tip do? Sorry if it's a dumb question, I'm new to this.
Edit: Found out. It prevents the bot from making a verification comment.

That was fun! I'll try to be there

Does the story need to be bitcoin related?
Shamelessly stolen from a post of mine on &gt;I'm a manager in a call center for a major financial institution. An older, Italian gentleman from the Bronx would call in every night, ask the rep for his balance and available credit, then ask to speak to a manager so he could say how great the agent was. This happened every night. One night, he told me a story that kind of stuck with me. I'll attempt to write it like he spoke it.




Edited to add: What kind of material are the cards printed on? Is it the same kind of plastic that credit cards are printed on? Would this be the kind of thing that I could, or should, carry around in my wallet?

I'm stoked that I got a small tip. It was enough to push me into finally setting a wallet up. After lurking the hell out of the Moronic Monday thread tomorrow, I plan to buy a small amount of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:16:47
NPR's Planet Money has done a few. That's actually what got me interested in bitcoin.

I'll save the next person the trouble. It's not 0-9 or a-k.

Also, thank you for finally give me the push that I needed to give bitcoin a shot!
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:40:29
I find the trolls way less annoying than the "donate to my totally ligit and definitely not a scam charity!" posts. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:37:15
Without actually tipping me, would you mind telling me how much a shitty tip is? I've seen that a few times and it's hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:02:01
Noob here. I wouldn't mind seeing a breakdown of how wallets work and what makes some better than the rest. For example, I know that a paper wallet is better for long term storage of bitcoin that you're holding on to, but it seems like it's probably complicated to set up. 
Also, for someone completely unfamiliar with bitcoin, it kind of looks like there aren't many places that one can use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:05:57
Do you still not have any proof?
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:24:54
The fraud department for the bank I work for calls those "out of wallet" questions. They're supposed to be questions that someone that found your wallet wouldn't be able to answer. 
The questions are largely pulled from your credit report. You may want to pull your credit report and make sure everything is correct. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:58:16
Got it! Thanks for the 500 bits!
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:30:39
Works great now! Any idea when/if you'll expand to Richmond, VA?

What's up with all of the "bitcoin isn't currency, it's a settlement" stuff I'm seeing? 
@_date: 2016-01-11 05:07:00
@_date: 2014-11-03 04:21:56
Should I use ChangeTip or another wallet? I set up an account with GreenAddress. Any preference to which is better for general use?
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:15:39
That's how the sentence would be conjugated in German, correct?
My high school German class was two decades ago.

~~Greater than $10k in one day requires a SAR.~~
is completely correct.

If I wasn't so lazy, I'd call Allied Irish Bank and report compromised account information.
