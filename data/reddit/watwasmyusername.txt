I'm talking likelihood of the reason why anyone would be using a CC to buy their crypto. I'm not adding anything, I'm speculating on reasoning. Otherwise, tell me, what reason is there whatsoever to use a CC to buy your crypto, to build credit? Just use your CC on everyday purchases if that's what you want to do.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:17:48
Why would you? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:52:08
Yes, if. But why buy on credit to begin with?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:43:17
Or just stay in crypto... forever. And "lose" your wallet.
Of course this presupposes that businesses will eventually take crypto as payment en masse.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:52:58
plz ban
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:48:10
Is it really a good idea to buy on credit...?
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:28:13
Because you're going to pay fees which you can avoid if you just send your $$$ into your Coinbase account, and the fact someone is buying on credit leads me to believe (since they could otherwise avoid fees by just transferring USD) that they don't actually have the money/means to pay it back, thus they are likely banking on being able to cash out and pay off the CC and have some "extra" to keep.

I'm pretty sure people don't say money has no intrinsic value. The context of this quote is 99% of the time in response to people critiquing Bitcoin itself as having no "true" value, and so people counter-argue with this point, as they should. 
Really the argument (what people "say") is that *fiat currency* has no more intrinsic value *than* Bitcoin. And truly, if anything, it absolutely does have less value.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:33:12
The dollar/fiat is value from nothing. Everyone just agrees basically behind threat of violence that it holds the value it supposedly holds.
Bitcoin from a technical standpoint actually has more legitimacy to its value than fiat; it is a scarce commodity, meaning there will only ever be a limited amount in existence. Scarcity is what drives the value of a thing *upward*. This clearly gives BTC more value than paper fiat whose value is entirely stationed within debt and "because we said so". Fiat's inflation is the direct result of the Federal Reserve being given the power to print fiat *endlessly and as needed*. 
The dollar has inflated so incredibly high since the powers-that-be (central government and regulation) took it off the gold standard (it's currently on no standard or the standard of debt) while the value of Bitcoin has only *deflated* (gained value) due in part to hype, but also very much so in part to the fact of the technology *providing scarcity*. This has been quite consistently the case since its implementation.

Is a brand new car that will only depreciate in value worth it? Seems you could get a functional vehicle with little to no issues for around 3k, then you'd have a real nice amount left for anything else you need/want (btc).
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:34:27
All it does is drive the value up further of the existing coins. Satoshi may have accounted for the idea of lost coins but there's not much chance he could accurately predict the amount that would be lost.
I'd say if he did try to compensate, it was just an arbitrary amount. And regardless, again, the value of coins that are being held (not lost) will be driven up and it won't make much of a difference.
Unless I'm not thinking of something.

I feel like the so-called "free market paradox" applies to many things in this world, because humans are constantly trying to impose their will/vision upon the way things truly are, that is, *reality*. 
That is the fact of things. The free market paradox is a specific instance of this rule. If you think about, for instance, government in general, it is a *centralization of actions*, meaning that the laws that are passed are designed to *regulate* the actions of human beings. So truly we always live in anarchy, but pretend that we don't (bitcoin is anarchy, fiat is a pretension). 
Just some thoughts.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:43:29
isn't it true though?
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:24:15

Ignore him. It's just a post on a forum. 
Sometimes it really helps ease someone's mind to have someone there to answer questions.
In Bitcoin there are blockchains. These are what track transactions and movement of BTC.
A fork is when a snapshot is taken of the current block of the chain and that block is used as the starting point for a new chain. That is, if a transaction goes through, it breaks off and the new block doesn't affect the old chain whatsoever. 
S2X is a supposed "hard" fork that was designed to do this, but with the idea in the devs' minds that it will replace BTC. They want to replace BTC with this coin as the "updated" version, as transactions (txs) won't take as long because there would be more room for transactions between users to take place.
This is my rudimentary understanding.

I think with Squarecash implementing a BTC buy/sell/transfer option, hopefully more apps and such will follow suit, and eventually people will prefer using it.
As it is right now, it's not the most user-friendly/accessible form of value transfer.

Honestly it seems it would be advisable. It's not that expensive, and if you buy one per week, it's not even that expensive. Hell even one a day isn't too expensive... 
$5 per day x 7 days = $35 a week. Maybe you make $30 an hour? That's barely more than an hour's work for a small chance to win huge.
Of course $35 a week on BTC would be superior.

The equivalent for BTC is the "be your own bank" aspect of the technology; there is absolutely intrinsic value to that, as well as blockchain tech to begin with.

It's just such a moot point because any medium of transaction/exchange of value can always be used for bad things. It's literally the dumbest argument about the "negatives" of BTC and Crypto.
edit: also BTC doesn't entirely rely on the internet. at the very least everyone still has their funds for when the internet comes back.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:29:05
Ignore him. It's just a post on a forum. Sometimes it really helps ease someone's mind to have someone there to answer questions.
In Bitcoin there are blockchains. These are what track transactions and movement of BTC.
A fork is when a snapshot is taken of the current block of the chain and that block is used as the starting point for a new chain. That is, if a transaction goes through, it breaks off and the new block doesn't affect the old chain whatsoever.
S2X is a supposed "hard" fork that was designed to do this, but with the idea in the devs' minds that it will replace BTC. They want to replace BTC with this coin as the "updated" version, as transactions (txs) won't take as long because there would be more room for transactions between users to take place.
This is my rudimentary understanding.

Actually the main selling point of bitcoin is that you can be your own bank and not rely on others to hold your store(s) of value. The rest is a necessary result of this.
And the risk is kind of high. It would certainly be ridiculous.

Thanks so much for the response! Really appreciate it, first of all.
I don't want to miss out on any amount of free money I can get my hands on in order to reinvest it into BTC. 0.1% is actually not a bad return amount at all, unless I'm failing basic math again (likely). 0.1% = Your amount * 1.001, correct?

Hi. I'm still somewhat new. I'm aware paper wallets are safer than holding on an exchange because then you technically hold the bitcoins themselves.

Don't get me wrong, I am able to transfer my BTC any time. The main issue is just getting a totally secure wallet so I don't have to worry about anything, and it's too late to get a hardware wallet before the fork in 4 days, as it would not arrive in time. 
With 2FA on an Electrum wallet, is it pretty damn reasonably safe? Someone would need both a key logger and some sort of 2fa reader on my phone.. which seems very unlikely. You'd agree with that?

I'm currently in process of figuring out how to make a perfectly secure offline wallet. I am very nervous about it, however, and I am feeling pressure due to the incoming fork/btcGold in 4 days.
Is this pressure completely in my head? I'm wanting to send my BTC to my own wallet, but I haven't gotten a totally secure offline one set up yet. I could do a basic Electrum wallet but I am very incredibly paranoid about being hacked. 
Is my paranoia/the pressure all in my head? 
Edit: for instance, is having 2fa on my Electrum wallet (online) seriously not secure enough?

It makes me nervous to have all my BTC under my own possession when many exchanges are insured (and I am not). Is that so hard to understand? I'm well aware of my responsibilities.
What you're doing is judging me based on your own convictions instead of simply answering the question. I obviously would have nobody to blame but myself... and yet, the same is true if I have my own BTC in my own wallet and I get personally hacked. So I'm not sure what the issue is.

There is still plenty of BTC to buy. Until it's fully run out of stock, it seems this wouldn't be the case.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:33:10
Yes there is, actually. It's called having holdings of which you've already paid the taxes on.
Or, there's the fact of BTC's decentralization. If you have no income, and all your holdings are in BTC, and you pay for everything in BTC, how in the hell are you going to owe taxes? You don't have a damn income!
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:27:09
Just send it to a personal wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:25:33
And if they continue to hold, instead of panic sell with their weak hands (as I'm sure you did), they'll be in the green in no time at all. If they've been DCA'ing through all the dips, then they're definitely in the green, but it's unlikely most of them did much research of their own before investing, but you can't blame BTC or crypto for that.
Regardless, the most anyone can be down is 50% at this moment in time, no matter when they bought, and again, it's a fact that the vast majority of BTC holders are in the green.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:18:42

Wtf? Source on that please? 
Thanks again for your time.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:14:25
I'm not 100% sure but my understanding is, if the new forked coin takes off, Coinbase will likely bring about support within a year's time after the fork as they are supposedly doing with BCH (people who had BTC in Coinbase at the first fork will receive their BCH at the start of the new year).
One downside is, if the new coin is popular and has some worth at least in the beginning, you won't have access to that coin to dump it if you wished to.
If your BTC are in a private wallet, you can have access to them immediately. 
Please, someone correct me if I am wrong, as I am still a noob myself.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:49:29

Yes that's the one and only reason to be your own bank, so that the bank doesn't steal your money. eyerollemoji
And it does matter what % of all gold is used in its use cases if your argument is that the use case is what gives it value. The truth is that gold's use cases have very little to do with its perceived value. That value is far more embedded in belief systems. This is pretty easily proven by the fact that gold is used in most new technology (past few centuries or so) but has retained value since *long* *before widespread electricity manipulation.*

Also... I feel there is a higher risk of having all my btc on software wallet(s) than in an exchange that has insurance.

They are an American company that is insured. Trust me, they wouldn't get away with anything, and it's about 99.9% likely that they'd reimburse people, eventually, if they were to be hacked.
That said I agree about controlling private keys; it's the entire point of BTC. However, I'm just not ready to do that yet, as I think it's more likely I would personally get hacked than Coinbase would be successfully hacked.

With all the use cases of gold combined, it still does not make up even close to the majority of all gold that has been found. I'm just guessing but it's 5% or less. The rest of gold is hoarded. And is wearing jewelry really a use case...?

Why do you ignore the legitimate arguments I've made and revert to a condescending tone and just repeat the obviously flawed arguments you've made...?
The only use case gold had for thousands of years was jewelry which is hardly a use case at all. Even with the use case of electronics and "other conductive uses" (how is this even a different category?), the amount of gold needed for this is extremely low, so why such a high value for the metal if you don't even need much if any of it?
Bitcoin is a decentralized immutable ledger that allows an individual to be their own bank. That is intrinsic value.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:03:06
The argument that gold has real world uses and therefore is a valuable hard asset is fucking retarded. The amount of gold you need in any manufacturing sector is so incredibly negligible compared to the full gold supply, probably like 5% or less. The vast majority of gold is hoarded, just like BTC. 


It's arguable whether there's a need for it. I think there is. That's a matter of opinion. As far as demand, the \~$264 billion dollar market cap of cryptocurrencies clearly proves there's demand. 
Want is pretty much the same thing. You just wanted a third thing to list for dramatic effect, a sign that deep down you know your arguments are weak and you know just as little as you accuse the rest of these folks of.
