Big words, 0 understanding.
You do realise that right now BTC through put demand is not even a fraction of a fraction of the "trans international reserve currency" you're dreaming about. 
If we look at a conservation estimate of 50,000 transaction per second and 2nd layer takes 99% load off the chain that still requires 500 transactions per second. BTC can barely do 5 tps and trust me when I say 50k tps is conservative.. Meanwhile you have DAG based currencies starting to breach 10k+ tps on chain without burning millions of dollars in energy and resources.
Keep dreaming.

Yea, let's ignore changing market conditions and throw all our money at it and hope the wave carries us.
That about sums up this sub.

Please, this is not even 0.1% of the demand.

What do you mean shady? I've never had any issue with Coinbase. Though I agree if you're planning on holding onto your coins for a long time you should not leave them on an exchange. That has nothing to do with Coinbase particularly.
Edit: If you want to move everything you just buy a Ledger Nano and move everything to it. It's really that simple.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:26:30
It's good that you've developed some technical knowledge and are able to spot BS when you see it but you have to step back and look at the bigger picture. 
If you've got a good plan you should be looking to double your capital every 6 months so does it really matter if you're paying an extra 1% for fees?
If you're planning on holding for years then the fees matter even less. You're going to eat yourself up if you worry about 1% and 2% margins in crypto, that stuff is just noise.
Good luck!

Trust is the basis of all human interaction and for the first time in history it is possible to do trustless transactions with people half way across the globe without the need for third party guarantees. 
That's basically what block chain does. You can look into any industries that require third party trust and study how they can be made more efficient by replacing the middlemen with block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:44:47
tl;dr: Instead of solving the problem directly lets exacerbate it and create a set of new problems because we can make more money that way. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:59:46
Have you noticed how contentious hard forks are? BTC can't even adopt its own innovation let alone other coins.
Look at where Segwit adoption is. 
Look at where BCH is.
LN will fracture the community even further because in its most efficient form it's a centralized staking system on top of the BTC network so it won't even be used a crypto currency anymore. It'll be like converting it to fiat and then spending it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:53:06
First of all your 2nd point is pretty much irrelevant because PoW currencies are on their way out of the door because like you said they consume an enormous amount of energy and they also have fundamental scaling problems. Look into DAG based currencies that are 1000s of times faster, feeless and have little to no energy requirements.
For your first point you'll just have to make your mind up as no one can give you a straight answer. Do you believe that the current monetary system is fair for everyone taking into account things like money printing, account seizures, taxation etc. If you do, then you should stay away from cryptos.
I personally believe that the current monetary system is unfair and will eventually be replaced but anyone who thinks fiat currencies will be gone in the next few years is delusional. I don't think systems of such scale move at that pace and in any event, crypto currencies are not yet ready to replace that system on a technological level. It would be a bigger catastrophe if the world suddenly switched to crypto tomorrow, nothing would work. So we still have a long way to go before that transition happens. So I just use crypto as an investment vehicle, that way you're in the game but not so emotionally charged and when the time comes you have a bunch of fiat to transition in the next system and the knowledge to do so correctly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:01:20
If it's on TV it's old news. There is some incredible innovation happening in the alt space. If you want to know what the future of crypto currencies looks like look at rising alt coins.

The truth is most people do it for fiat profits which is fair enough since fiat isn't going anywhere any time soon.

Yea this is not a game, they are not weak hands. You try buying at 20k and watch it vaporize in less than a week and then come post here.

How dare you? You need to post 5 ATH memes in a row as a punishment for the crime of talking about fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:57
Same, got out at 10k. Will consider getting back in sub 5k if the fundamentals improve. Most people just don't understand that BTC as a technology is failing abysmally.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:15:46
And this is where most people get burnt.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:31:29
The technology has come to a major obstacle which is this:
Long term on-chain scaling is not possible and off-chain scaling leads to centralization which is not so different from paypal/visa/mastercard. If you can't see this you need to read up and contemplate.
Blockchain introduced us to the concept of large scale decentralized services which I think is the real take away from this experiment. Block chain itself as a technology is flawed, mainly the PoW aspect of it. We'll see what PoS brings but for now I'm a skeptic. 
So investing in BTC or any other PoW based crypto based on fundamentals is a big no no. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:21:24
It's all about the price, anyone that says otherwise is a hypocrite.


I hate the fact that people take this for granted and present it as a fact which is the hea. No, block chain does not have the ability to do this yet and most likely never will which is becoming clearer with each passing day. It can't even cater to 1% of the global demand so we're now looking at off-chain scaling solutions which is completely uncharted territory that is theoretically problematic and has centralization concerns.
The more you learn about bitcoin the more you'll see that its price is totally unjustified in terms of fundamentals. The next logical question is, if the fundamentals aren't supporting the price then what is? Greed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:31:59
Yep, 30 mil USDT was printed a couple of hours ago. Price going to go up by at least 300.

Let's throw all the conjecture, evidence and counter evidence away for a minute and address the real practical issue. 
Why are withdrawals limited to a special "close" clients only? Why can't everyone withdraw funds as they wish? What would you think of your bank if their withdrawals were discretionary for months on end?
It's pretty simple, if withdrawals were available to everyone all this would go away instantly but they're not and that raises suspicions.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:32:46
Technology evolves, you don't throw stuff out and start from scratch every 3 years. The Internet is nearly 50 years old, may be you should stop using it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:22:18
Could happen. Last pre-fork dump went from 5.9k to 5.4k to 5.8k to 5.1k. I just think a lot of new people bought at 7500+ and watching it drop 1k in less than 24hrs is stressful for those who aren't used to the bitcoin roller coaster.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:39:36
When the difficulty is low miners get to mine more coins and when that happens the chain with the lower hash rate has a chance of dying because of long block times so people sell coins with low hash rate and jump ship to the other one.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:40:20
Be warned, there is a very good chance it will drop to 6000 in the next week but it will bounce back. This was predicted a few days and is almost a certainty now because of the rise of BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:39
What principle orgasms? Bitcoin adoption by merchants has dropped significantly because of high transaction fees and slow confirmations. Where are the principled supporters talking about this?
This sub is entirely about price and how BCH is shit, there is nothing principled here. BTC hodlers have this false moral high ground where they think just because they bought some BTC at the right time they somehow did the world a massive favor but in reality everyone is just speculating. Everything else is just make yourself feel better stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:25:52

Don't worry about man, a quick look at his comment history tells me he's probably bought 0.5-1 bitcoins at the very top thinking it's his ticket to retirement. Every time BTC drops $20 he loses his mind and starts jumping up and down.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:24:38
Yes, and I'm presenting my guess based off what I've seen in the last 2 months which you outright rejected and provided absolutely no reason for doing so. In order to make money off speculating you have to make a guess and stick with it.
And oh look, the price isn't going up.

It's a "clear dip" in hindsight. 
Can you say with 80% certainty if the price will be 5k or 9k by Monday? If so, why don't you take out a 100k loan and trade with 50x margin? You could be a millionaire in 2 weeks.
It's very easy to say what you're saying in hindsight and no money on the line but total different ball game when you're sticking your neck out.

Inflated prices are useless since you lose buying power, you're supposed to adjust down for inflation not up. It's disingenuous to say BTC price will be higher in the future because of inflation, that could be said for literally anything.

Bid/ask difference represents the volatility of an asset. Right now there is a lot of uncertainty in the market with transactions being slow, hash power flowing back and forth, BCH somewhat showing competitiveness and lots of propaganda flowing around.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:59:06
It really depends on your financial situation and what you want to do. It's super risky buying this high if you're not prepared to HODL through the worst for a year or 2.
If you're a long term believer and think we're going to 500k in 5 years time, which is not a joke, then buying at 7k is obviously a bargain!

There will always be dips but they are largely inconsequential in the long term. If you want to be conservative you can buy 50% now and then 50% whenever the next dip happens, for now I think we're shooting to 9500 no matter what.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:29:22
If you're investing long term then price action doesn't matter at all as long as you don't buy at an ATH.
People who are selling at 7850 are probably the ones who hit their targets after shorting somewhere between 8300 and 8200 (I shorted at 8090 and closed at 7900) and waiting for the next trade signal. Traders have to claim profits at some point, they don't have the luxury of sitting on positions forever.
My point orignal was, it's nowhere near as east as you think it is.

Do you even know what volatility means?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:23:48
I only use stop losses when I leave a position open over night (which is very rare) and they are loose, very very loose. 
I usually manage risk by hedging. You were long and the price is moving against you? Just go short and when you get to the bottom of the swing just cash out on the short and go long because crypto always swings. If it goes against you again just do the same thing till it swings all the way back. If you study charts for the last 2 months, there hasn't been a swing where the price hasn't recovered from within 24-48 hours. The trick is to bet such that you're able to follow it up with a hedge immediately and still have some margin left in the tank.
I'm in Sydney by the way! If you're close we could hang out ;)
Edit: Trade timing is very important as well. I find that the big moves with clear signals usually happen between 5pm - 10pm, after that the price action is really shit. Usually moving back and forth in a 100-200 range. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:58:21
If I want to move the market I will do it on the exchange with the lowest fees. What is wrong with that?
This sub is basically a cult, any time BTC prices halt for more than 2 hours the pitch forks are out. I'm not even for or against BCH or BTC, this is basic markets 101. Whales move the market and everyone else collects scraps.

I would never advise someone to convert entire positions but ETH is in the dumpster right now because of the recent hack and BTC vs BCH battle. If I had a position in ETH I'd look to put at least 30% of it in BCH. ETH still has potential in the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:17
Sell half and buy BCH with it. Regardless of all the politics going on right now you can hedge your risks easily. BCH is going to 2k guaranteed, we don't know where the bottom is for BTC and you can sell it for a really good price right now and then buy back in if the bleeding stops. If it bleeds really badly then BCH will have gone up significantly so you don't lose too much.
Right now BCH and BTC prices are reciprocally correlated. Use that to your advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:37:59
Because it's valued based on pure speculation at the moment.

@_date: 2017-11-05 12:17:14
There will be a crash no doubt but it's retarded to short long term in the middle of a crazy uptrend like this. 
I've been long since 6.5k but you can still make decent money off the 200-300 retracements after a significant ATH. For example I'll definitely short if we hit 8k this week and some fresh USDT are minted.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:53:04
Because there is no single entity that decides the price of bitcoin. It's based on supply and demand, if you don't like the price take your business elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:19:32
Wow, "Chain bloat", that's some next level mental gymnastics.
What exactly is the use case for bitcoin, besides speculation, if you can't freely register transactions on the block chain?

@_date: 2017-11-09 04:21:16
You don't get it do you? This is bleeding edge technology and no one knows what the right answer is so there's different people working on different solutions. 
I hate it when people bring forward the point that you have and in the way you have because it implies there is someone going around stopping merchants from using bitcoins for all their payments. The truth is that it hasn't happened yet because the technology isn't capable of it. We've nailed the secure and decentralized part but the scaling bit still has a way to go. 
Guess what would happen if your wish was granted tomorrow and magically every single coffee and pan cake place on earth accepted bitcoin? The network would crash and nothing would get through bringing bitcoin bad rep.
So please, for the love of all that is block chain, stop spreading this narrative.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:56:17
I'm going to explain in very plain terms the concept of public/private keys, you can look into RSA encryption to look at the specific implementation and if you have some coding experience you can code it up in any language in a few hours easily.
The idea is to take any random string and a apply non-linear transformation to it to obtain an output string. A non-linear transformation means to change X into Y such that it's impossible to derive Y from X.
For example a simple non-linear transformation would be to replace the first digit in the string with 4 if it's greater than 6 or z if it's less than 6.
Applying this rule to "x11c73" would result in "xz1c73". Now looking at the result string there is no way to go back to the original string because it could be a number of possibilities like 
"x11c73", "x21c73", "x31c73", "x41c73" or "x51c73".
Now using a simple transformation like this would probably result in "collisions" which means the same result string coming from different original strings and it can also be reverse engineered easily because the number of possible variations is small but real algorithms have dozens of carefully chosen transformations that give an enormous amount of unique outputs and are impossible to reverse engineer.
That's basically it, when you send coins to someones public key, everyone on the network receives the message. They then apply the decryption algorithm to their private key, if it matches the public key received in the message they can claim ownership.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:20:54
It's called consolidation, it's when the big boys are slowly piling onto their position (buy or sell) without changing the price too much for a big move coming ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:57:51
The idea is to create a network such that it is more profitable to participate in it legitimately than to attack it and the various proof of Xs are just different ways of validating transactions with different trade offs on such a network.

Eventually we will use Crypto for micro transactions but BTC is not the right crypto for it because of its extremely deflationary nature. 
Hell as far as transaction speed and fees go BCH is far far superior to BTC at the moment and they go by the whole usage = adoption philosophy. Let BTC bring the big money into crypto, everything else will follow.

Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. It's a common term when something is going down in value and people are panicking. Opposite of FOMOing,
Fear of missing out which is what drives the price up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:41:45
I don't think so. 
Last per fork dip was from 5.9k to 5.1k which is 13% drop. 13% from 7.5k gives us 6.5k. I will buy 30% of my position back at 6.7k, 30% at 6.5k and the rest when the trend starts reversing.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:02:13

It's going to 6500 100%, possibly 6k because of BCH hitting 1000 tonight or tomorrow. I've temporarily started trading BCH, it went from 450 to 870 in 24 hours and expected to hit 1k today or tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:10:08
I was a skeptic till about 6.5k, I even shorted at 6.3k but once that line was crossed I knew the bulls couldn't be challenged.
Fork + Futures has generated an insane amount of momentum and mind you this is happening without China. If China un-ban news comes out we'll be at 10k in 2 weeks.
I would buy in but be ready to sell at a loss if we start to a see reversal, and there will be one at some stage guaranteed, and then buy back in when the correction is complete. It's basic risk to reward calculation. You buy at 7k and are prepared to risk $500 for a potential gain of $1-3k which is not a bad deal. 
But if you're going to be putting yourself under financial stress then I would advise against it.
 As I was typing this the price has jumped to $7.3k.
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:12:36
What does that have to do with anything? It's very simple, you need miners to secure the network, without the miners you can't process transactions and your network is prone to attacks. There is no other hidden over arching explanation, it's a simple concept.

@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:40
There is a finite amount of bitcoin that can be mined, 21 million to be exact. That means the mining has to be controlled and bring it down to a halt slowly so every few years the rewards from mining are halved which is the main reason BTC is a deflationary currency. It's value goes up if it just sits there.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:29:33

All these emotional "ATH" or "Can't beat BTC" posters are absolutely clueless and will get burnt badly at some point.
OP, if you want to get educated and protect your capital do some reading into Bitifinex finances, the recent Tether scam and how it's all linked to BTC price.
I've profited off BTC bull run just as much as the next guy but I'm aware of what's going on and don't have dreams of becoming a millionaire off it in 2 years time. The party will stop at some point and you need to not be greedy then.

Countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela where the traditional monetary systems are failing people are putting all their eggs into the bitcoin basket because it's outside the system. I don't see any reason why smart people with money won't do that. Money will flood into crypto and metals as it usually does in times of uncertainty.

Anyone with half decent knowledge of speculative markets would have known that a down swing was coming. Simply put, nothing goes up forever because people have to take profits at some point which drives the price down. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:55:18
It's more profitable to cash in on pre-fork hype right before the fork and drive the prices down, buy in cheaper and then push the price up. People with a lot of money do this all the time. The exact same thing happened right before the gold fork.
They essentially get to cash out twice by doing this.

Parabolic growth my friend. It took 3 years for BTC to go from 0 to 600 and 24 hours to go from 6500 to 7400.
Another fact is that BTC is a deflationary asset and we have a halving scheduled in 2020 which will more or less double the price at the time.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:30:28
I don't think you've learned anything, this seems like a knee jerk reaction packaged with a justification. 
What happens if BTC drops to 5k tomorrow? Do you have a plan for that situation? Will you unlearn what you've learned today and go back to BCH? or Will you double down and add to your position? 
You can't deal in absolutes because the market changes quicker than you think so you need to have constant streams of information informing your decision. That process is the key to trading/investing. Remember the law of large numbers, the outcome of 1 trade is as good as random but the overall outcome of 100 or 1000 trades accurately represents your trading/investment strategy. If you don't have a well defined strategy you will lose, guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:38:41
My comment there got delete so I'll say it again. Market cap does not represent the amount of money flowing in, BFX consistently wash trades on margins of 100s of millions of dollars to artificially drive the price up and all the other exchanges follow. 
If there are 10 BTC in the market and the price going price is $1000, the market cap is $10,000. If I buy and sell 2 of my own coins with counterfeit money  at $2000, all of a sudden the market cap is $20,000. I've just raised the market cap by $10,000 without losing a penny.

Calling tops and bottoms on BTC is risky business. Unless you've got enough margin to hold positions out your stop losses are most likely going to get destroyed.

Ok Mr, how much should a sandwich be worth in bitcoin without considering the fiat price of 
a sandwich? It's not that easy is it? 
Point is everything is relative and you need a shared frame of reference to transition from one system to another. What better way to demonstrate that X is better than Y than by making X = 7000 times Y? 
Do you think bitcoin would have gotten this much exposure without this price? What would the news look like? "Man buys sandwich with digital currency, we are free from fiat tyranny!" 
The vast majority of people have no clue about bitcoin and of the people who know about bitcoin the majority still are clueless about block chain which is the real golden goose here. A transparent, decentralized digital asset is only one of the applications of block chain, we haven't even scratched the surface. You should stop looking at bitcoin as the solution to all your problems and start finding applications for block chain.

I would advise people to lock in 30-50% profits. 10k is a massive psychological level, similar to 5k. The slightest bit of wrong news could easily send us into a 40% correction, specially with the rumors about BFX in the air.
Regardless of whether your loyalties lie with BTC, FIAT or BCH,  don't be greedy. It never works out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:57:18
The solution is to wait for clear signals, don't get greedy by setting goals and set stop losses. I made $100k in 24 hours going long on with 50 BCH at 1000 and short on 50 BTC at ~6200.
Leverage is your friend if you're smart about it.
Only reason I couldn't make more was because my broker reached risk limit.
There are still plenty of opportunities in the coming month to make some serious cash. The HODL mindset is to become a millionare in 5-10 years but you can do that in 1 year if you play you leverage correctly. That's how the big boys do it.
Edit: Started this account in October with 4k so you don't need mad cash to get things going.

Walls generally prevent prices from changing so whales use it to create an ideal buying or selling zone. Once they are done with the price pocket they tear the wall down and shove the price in the direction they want because there are very few orders on either side.
For example buyers are afraid of sell walls because they think it can't be broken so they don't buy near it, sellers are afraid of it because they think some whale wants to dump everything so they start selling in front of the wall under fear of not getting the best possible price. This way the sellers that are beyond the wall come in front of the wall which weakens resistance further up. So if you put up a huge sell wall at 6300 and manage to bring 6350-6400 sellers under it you've just broken through a resistance for $100 less and when you "break through" the imaginary 6300 wall you give a huge confidence boost to the scared buyers in the back creating momentum.
Never read a book on trading, just a lot of reading here and there, watching videos and watching price action for 30 hours straight at a time. I'm basically talk to the price action now ;)

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:52:57
I would say this is not the bottom. Last pre-fork dip lasted 2 days and was around 13% going from 5.9k to 5.1k. Applying the same from 7.5k gives us roughly 6.5k which lines up perfectly with the h1 200 moving average. We still have 8 full weekdays to go so I wouldn't be surprised for this dump to continue till Tue/Wed.
For people wanting to buy dips don't buy it all at once as there is no way of knowing where the bottom is. You want to stagger your buy ins. For example buy 20-30% where your initial guess is and then keep adding the small amount s as price drops buy 100-200 and then buy the final 30% when there is a clear reversal in the trend.
You don't get the absolutely best price but you do curb a lot of the risk and in the grand scheme of things, 200-300 doesn't matter much. What you don't want is to miss the buy zone by 500-600+ because that hurts. Try to be in the middle for consistent profits.

The limited supply of gold is physically rooted in the laws of nature, the limited supply of BTC is abstractly rooted in a world where it would be unfeasible to create a replica.
We can all value gold intuitively but you'd have to understand technology, economics and people to truly understand the argument for BTC. It's similar to why asking can't you just go and create Amazon or Google 2.0? Well, there is no hard law against it, only the soft ban of feasibility.
That being said, if BTC fucks up then obviously something else will come along and take over.

Not in this case but if you buy 2 bitcoins, 1 male and 1 female (female bitcoins cost a bit less but is slightly more prone to being hacked so in some cases you might be able to afford to pair 2 females with 1 male for higher profits but you will be sacrificing the long term potential of the male coin) and then hodl them in the same wallet for 9 months and if during those 9 months the value of bitcoin doubles, you will see a third smaller coin in your wallet.
Its value won't be the same as the other fully grown ones but with time it will grow up to be strong and worth a full bitcoin.

PS: CFDs are illegal in most countries because they are very risky but you can make it work if you're not stupid greedy and set your stop losses correctly.

Support levels don't matter in fire sales because there's no way of knowing where the bottom is. Whales will short at the top and drive prices right through support levels to trigger stop losses further increasing the momentum and they also decide where to stop the bleeding.

Satoshi is a genius but no one is perfect. That statement is more or less self contradictory. Cash as we know it inflationary which encourages spending since it will be worth less tomorrow so we want to do something with it in order to get more of it. Bitcoin is deflationary which encourages hodling. It' supply and demand, doesn't get any more basic then that.
I'm a tech enthusiast, I totally get where you're coming from but it is fundamentally impossible to convince people to spend something today that is going to be worth twice as much in a year. It's just as simple as that. Bitcoin is digital gold and who knows having something similar to a gold standard without the limits of gold might be good in the long run.
As far as micro transactions go, I think Ethereum is far superior than bitcoin in its current state. LN hasn't demonstrated any true potential yet and there are lots of theoretical concerns regarding its promises. We'll see.

Investors invest so they can get profits, they have set goals and when those goals are hit they claim their profits and wait for the next opportunity to get back into the market. That's why prices go up and down and you don't have to be a pro to know that.

You are greatly underestimating the amount of work required to create a network the size of BTC, that's why you can't see the value. 
Billions of dollars in mining investment, the time required to get the network effect rolling, community, actually make sure the chain is secure and having enough momentum to be able to inspire investment in the future. You can literally go and take a snapshot of BTC right now and create a japt2Coin but it won't go anywhere.

You mean support? Yes, I'm very surprised at 7k surviving 2 dumps but that could just be the whales supporting it so that they don't have to pump it all the way up from 6-6.5k again. That being said there have been a lot of buys at 7k which means whales could just smash through those longs for big profits.
I'm still holding off half my position for the 6.5k dip. If it comes it comes, if not I'm happy to sacrifice some profit for not being liquidated out of the game.

It's speculation based on what happened around the last fork. Here's a chart you can look at 
We can see that it went up to 5.9k then dropped sharply to 5.1k. It dropped a second time after that as well but I don't think we'll see a sharp drop this time because we have 2 catalysts driving the market.
That being said the whales are aware of this mania as well and they could totally decide to crash the market, make huge profits on shorts and then hit ATH with cheap buys. 
Whatever your idea is, make sure you've got alarms and stop losses set up. Things move incredibly fast in this market.

Posted this yesterday to a similar question.
Walls generally prevent prices from changing so whales use it to create an ideal buying or selling zone. Once they are done with the price pocket they tear the wall down and shove the price in the direction they want because there are very few orders on either side.
For example buyers are afraid of sell walls because they think it can't be broken so they don't buy near it, sellers are afraid of it because they think some whale wants to dump everything so they start selling in front of the wall under fear of not getting the best possible price. This way the sellers that are beyond the wall come in front of the wall which weakens resistance further up. So if you put up a huge sell wall at 6300 and manage to bring 6350-6400 sellers under it you've just broken through a resistance for $100 less and when you "break through" the imaginary 6300 wall you give a huge confidence boost to the scared buyers in the back creating momentum.
It's not so easy to predict prices based on walls right now because the trend isn't as clear as it was a week ago so I'd tread carefully. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:34:04
Because it's deflationary by nature. When people say it might be worth half a million in 5-10 years it's not just based on demand increase, it's also the fact that supply is fixed and it gets harder and harder to mine over time.

@_date: 2017-11-12 13:44:40
It wasn't too hard to put the pieces together really. 
BTC broke its steady upward channel in a crazy way so it had to be corrected. On top of that all the FOMO news didn't come through, i.e no Amazon, no real progress on CME futures. The stuck transaction and high fee situation contributes to crowd sentiment as well.
BCH rose 50% the day before and BCH and BTC are direct competitors so a bull flag from BCH is pretty much sure fire bear flag for BTC and BCH fork coming up meant a pump was guaranteed. 
All these factors pretty much added to the certainty. I mean I really couldn't think of a reason for BTC to go past 7.5k again, there was nothing happening.
My only regret I didn't follow my initial feeling and shorted 80 at 6500, it was my first "big move" so I went a bit conservative.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:34:57
It's not their fault, a lot of hash power has bled to BCH and there is a huge sell off happening so transactions will take forever unless you selected a high fee.

This is known as support/resistance in trading. 
When you break through resistance convincingly it becomes the new support since all the scared buyers in the back come forward and it's time to hunt down the new resistance.
Now that previous ATH of 7500 has been passed comfortably it is likely to become short term support while medium support is around 6500-7000.
The 5200-5500 mark has proven to be extremely strong support since it has survived through 2 massive dumps so we probably will never see that price again unless something catastrophic happens.
One important thing to note is that BTC support levels are so strong because we've never really seen a 40% support level break so buyers usually buy their hearts out at those levels, which is sign of a long term bull market, but when an extremely strong support level breaks it sends out some scary signals. For example if 5k had been breached last weekend we would have been in a very different place right now. 
You can see all this on a chart very easily.

You greatly underestimate the FUD when whales start dumping. Say BTC is at 8000 when the dump starts happening, how do you decide a good price to buy in? Would you buy at 7800? What about 7500? What about 6000? If it dropped to 6000 and you thought 7000 was an absolute steal would you buy more at 6000 or wait for 5000? The reason prices go down is exactly the same as when they go down.

You're missing the point. You can do whatever you want with your bitcoin but good luck trying to convince other people to spend it when it will be worth twice as much next year. You might say fiat is dead etc but BTCs purchasing power goes up naturally because of its deflationary nature.
Why do you think BTC has gotten so much traction lately? Is it because you can buy rugs with it or because it went up 10x in price in 1 year?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:34:41
We usually see 30-40% correction at big psychological levels. My guess is we'll hit 10-10.5k and then correct to 6.5k before the 15-20k run.

@_date: 2017-11-11 23:19:33
When the price is very volatile your order might not get executed at the price you wanted because you are in a long queue. 
For example if you want to send order to sell if price falls below 6000 expecting it to sell somewhere between 5900-6000. If there are 1000 people ahead of you who have the same order, by the time your order comes to the front the price might be 5500 which is not ideal for you.

It entirely depends on where you are living as most exchanges will want to verify your payment method etc. Here in Australia the price is usually $400-500 above the rest of the world because, well it's fucking Australia. 
If you want to buy at market price, the best way to do that is to sign up on an exchange like Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bitstamp and put your bid in. Think of it as having something delivered to your door step vs going out their and finding it, negotiating a price and bringing it back home yourself. Coinbase is more of a retail seller where as exchanges are raw trading so of course Coinbase charges a premium.
If you're not too savvy when it comes to crypto it might be worth paying the premium and getting a fool proof service. $100 doesn't matter if you're holding long term.

You compared BTCs volume which has 30-60% of the total crypto market cap to AAPL which is less thatn 0.05% of the total stock market cap. So clearly, you either have no fucking clue how to do basic comparisons or you're a complete and utter bullshitter. In either case, not worth anyones time.

The problem with all these "but it always bounces back" statements is that BTC has only ever existed in a global bull market where monetary conditions have been the easiest they have ever been which means money has literally been growing on trees for the last 10 years. 
We have never seen BTC perform in a bear market so please be careful with the "buy the dip" narrative. To you it's just a thing you said but to other people that can be a lot of hard earned money. "Buy the dip" is exactly how smart money dumps onto dumb money and leaves the holding bags.
Do some research into the global economy, general market conditions are changing. We're already seeing weakness in the equity markets and gold/commodities have been rallying. That should give a clue as to where smart money thinks safe haven is.

You need to get out of this fishbowl sub and go read up on what's happening in the real world.
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:32:37
I see a lot of confusion about DAG currencies being feeless so here's what's really happening.
First of all you have to understand that there's a lot of crypto currencies out there and they're evolving at an astounding rate. This means that you have to separate yourself from the crowd by offering solution to a genuine problem and marketing the shit out of it. This is where the source of the confusion lies i.e overzealous marketing combined with a weak understanding of the technicals.
Let's look at the unique claims about DAG currencies, namely instant and feeless. Both those claims are a direct solution to BTCs high fees and slow transactions problem. It's not hard to see here that there is some ambitious marketing going on here but that doesn't mean the claims are fake, it's just that their technical definition is slightly different.
When they say "feeless" what they really mean is "feemarketless". What they're trying to do is to remove the fee market and make it so that the processing of your transaction does not depend on anyone else in the network, the only time a network consensus is needed is when there is a dispute. 
All things being equal, there is no benefit to keeping miners in the eco system if the network can be made just as secure by letting end users do their own POW. Now I know that's a big if but that's what they're trying to do. Besides, the fee market is artificial anyway. The only reason it exists is because of the artificial block size and time limits. DAG currencies remove the concept of block time and size and in the process render the fee market irrelevant. 
So what's the problem with the fee market? It's the same as any other market, when everything is running smoothly there is no problem but in times of crisis there is room for of exploitation. We saw what happened to BTC fees couple of months ago. As long as there is a possibility of human profit, even if the group is decentralized, during times of crisis the system will be unstable in the long term. Forget crypto currencies altogether and just think generally, do you really think its a good idea to delegate a service to a group of people and allow them to put up a pay wall when the service is in demand? Would it not be better to just do whatever it is you want to do yourself?
That, I think is the true meaning of decentralization where the code just works and that's all there is to it. Just like the block chain, transactions get signed and go into the block chain. No other way around it. DAG currencies are trying to make the process of transaction selection similarly "human proof" for lack of a better word.
The instant bit is just some marketing flavor combined with theoretical capacity. DAG currencies seem instant relative to BTC-like currencies because they don't have a concept of block time and space which means the real limit on transaction speed is the hardware required to calculate the PoW and the bandwidth required to propagate it. What this means is as hardware and bandwidth improves BTC chain won't because the time and size limits are arbitrary where as DAG currencies can grow more or less linearly as technology generally progresses. It takes advantage of innovation outside of its sphere which is a very underrepresented fact.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:53:50
I think you just found a new word and posted instantly before thinking about it.
Inflation and deflation can occur from both supply (money) and demand (goods and services) side.
If the world contains 2 apples and the total amount of money in the world is $100 then the price of 1 apple is $50. Next year, as the world population grows we will need to have more apples so even if the supply of money stays the same the price of apples will go down or conversely the buying power of your money will go up. Deflation.
This is the entire reason we have inflation. As population grows we need more resources and to keep the value of resources relatively stable and simultaneously discourage excessive hoarding we need to be able to manipulate money supply.
The reason why gold was and probably will be used as money in the future is because its supply is in a natural equilibrium with population growth. World population grows at about 1.15% every year and gold supply increases by between 1.5-2% so if we valued all goods and services in gold we would never need to manipulate the money supply. Of course the problem with gold currency is that you can't have perpetual deficit spending.

The theoretical basis of all blockchain technology is game theory. You'll get a much better understanding of the whole industry if you can learn to think using game theory.
Coding is just like playing an instrument. You just need to practice heaps and once you're proficient you can apply your skills to any language/framework. 
Most importantly you need to have a self starter attitude and learn to consume large amounts of information on a daily basis. This creates a huge opportunity in that you can become a great developer all by yourself but it also means there is no structured progression. 
Just remember, when you feel lost it's not because you're overwhelmed, it's because you don't know enough.
Good luck!

This is easily the dumbest comment I've read today. 
Hedge funds aren't mandated to beat the market, they're mandated to deliver steady returns in all market conditions and most important of all, preserve wealth. Of course, when CBs around the world are printing money like no tomorrow the market conditions part of their mandate will deliver no value as they can't go all in on the crazy passive ETFs of today because their portfolio risk is very tightly managed.
Wait till all these passive ETFs blow up if/when CBs stop printing money. That's when the research becomes valuable.
Trading the stock market for the last 8 years has essentially been all about front running CBs.

Like I said, it's all good when things are running smoothly, the problem is when there is a crisis and someone has the opportunity to make profit off of it. 


By exploitation I didn't mean organize an attack but the natural tendency to take advantage of the supply/demand imbalance. Why would a miner process a 1 sat/byte transaction when he can process 1000 sat/byte? This is what creates a natural negative feedback loop in times of crisis that makes the situation worse and worse.


This is a bit disingenuous. We saw a couple of months ago where you had to pay $30 to move $100. That's just a fact and it's unacceptable.


Agreed. I never said DAG currencies were the answer. They haven't been tested anywhere near as comprehensively as BTC chain but we know the BTC chain doesn't scale so it would be unfair to compare DAG currencies , since their main objective is to scale on chain, to BTC chain. We should compare scaling solution to scaling solution and in that regard DAG currencies should be compared to LN in which case I would say DAG currencies (particularly NANO) are a bit further ahead in terms having a working product but both have yet to prove themselves in the real world.

Market cap is 100% irrelevant when it comes to crypto currencies because we have very low liquidity. It's been estimated that even though the entire crypto market cap grew by several 100 billion in the last few months, the amount of actual money that entered the system was somewhere between 6 and 10 billion. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:47:36
It wasn't a 3 hour flash crash. Price has been tanking for 6 weeks so it's not a run on the books. Furthermore, price is still tanking now that the mgox sell off is over.
Also, the literal definition of liquidity in markets is the ability to get in and out on a whim without having too much effect on the price. So the "heads up" point holds no water at all.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:16:31
We've only seen bitcoins mainstream performance in a global bull market where credit was piss cheap and there was no inflation pressure on consumers.

I don't want to get into this debate so I'll just say this and we can leave it there.
Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin all have very different block time and space configurations and they all seem to do just fine in terms of security so to say that Bitcoins configuration is the correct one is a bit disingenuous. You can't say BTC is more secure than the rest because none of the chains have been successfully hacked yet.

You just don't understand scale do you? It took a week to confirm your transactions when the demand isn't even 1% of peak. What would happen if the demand rose by 10%? Now you're waiting 2.5 months for a pizza payment to clear. The whole reason everyone is shitting on BTC is that it doesn't scale past your average tech enthusiast demographic who uses it just because. 


This just shows you have 0 understanding of cash flow.

That's what they're trying to solve, DAG currencies haven't been tested the way BTC has been and that is reflected in the valuation. BTC is taking the off-chain route for scaling where as DAG is trying to solve the problem on chain. Only time will tell which one is better.

@_date: 2018-02-02 10:31:37


That's the problem. It became a political thing instead of a revolutionary technology. It doesn't scale, we see what happens even if it's stressed a tiny amount , regardless of whether transactions are spam or legitimate, and LN is still far away. I doubt we'll see it this year. Meanwhile serious competition has showed up, it's not just BTC is king and everything else is a scam coin. This is what BTC maximalists don't understand, the world changes and if your product doesn't you'll get left behind.
Also we're probably on the brink of an equity correction worldwide so big money is pulling out of risky assets and like it or not, the crypto market is still entirely speculative. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:27:14
When I said 1% peak I mean it as a percentage of large scale payment gateways out there like Visa/Mastercard/Paypal not 1% of BTCs peak. Those gateways do upwards of 2k tx/sec on average with a theoretical capacity of over 50k. 


If 10 tx/sec of supposedly spam transactions can cripple the network then it should be obvious that it is unfit for mass adoption.


This is apples and oranges. You can't use previous years as base case where no one even knew about BTC let alone use it as a currency.


Nobody is using it because the moment people start using it the network will tank. If I'm Amazon and I need 100 tx/sec and I just saw in the last 2 months that BTC is crippled at 10 tx/sec of "spam" why would I ever want to use it? Do you think Amazon is thinking "Oh shit the mempool is empty, quick setup a BTC payment option before it fills up again".

In a short position you make profit when the price goes down.

I'm not benefiting from this system therefore the system must be corrupt so I'm going to become a part of this other system where I have a decent stake so that when it becomes mainstream I'll benefit from it greatly. So really, you're doing exactly what you blame the evil bankers for doing. In fact, if bitcoin became the world currency tomorrow the wealth imbalance would be orders of magnitude worse than it is now.
Did you ever bother to stop and ask why the fuck a grown man with children has only $25 in his bank account? Say they didn't deduct the maintenance fee, would that make everything sunshine and rainbows?

BTC price action, both the rise and fall, is a function of it being a "thin market" which means most of the time majority of the market will be on one side of the trade. 
This is largely because there is no intrinsic value so it's 100% momentum based. There is no price level at which you can say "Ok, this is ridiculous. I fee comfortable betting against the crowd here because sooner or later everyone will see what I see". The price could have fallen down from 5k, 10k, 15k, or 500k. 20k was as arbitrary a level as any for a reversal.

I directly contested that statement and here I'll do it again.
a) BTC is not programmable money by any stretch of imagination. It's far far far behind Ethereum and even Ethereum is far far far away from being adopted in the real world. So, at best you're misinformed and once again I'll point out how BTC enthusiasts will take ideas for functioning products to support their arguments.
b) Pretty self explanatory.
c) Exchanges are a big problem for the crypto currency eco system in general. We're already seeing regulatory burden putting pressure on prices and it will only continue to get worse. Decentralized exchanges aren't anywhere near being ready. Hell we can barely use BTC in peak capacity for simple transactions, how do you think we'll run millions of market orders per second on a distributed ledger? Once again its a good idea and one that I'm all for but to take it for granted would be criminally dishonest.
d) We all saw what happened a few weeks ago where you couldn't use the BTC network without paying exorbitant fees. That's just a fact and you can choose to ignore it, your loss. Don't bring up LN as it's once again far far far away from being ready for use. There is a very small chance we'll see it running this year considering the recent lost funds sittuation and devs telling people not to use it.

A fork means the chain is splitting into 2 because there's a disagreement in the community on the direction moving forward.
Hard forks are particularly exciting because you can double your coins. Basically for every coin you have on the main chain before the fork, you can get an equal amount of coins for free on the new chain so you can effectively double your coins but it's not so simple as the value of coins change after a fork. We've already had 1 hard fork which split bitcoin into bitcoin and bitcoin cash. You can check the value of bitcoin cash yourself. 
The reason you should move your coins out of an exchange and into a wallet of your own is that exchanges won't give you the private key to your wallet which is how you extract coins from the new chain after the fork.
Also leaving your coins on an exchange is generally not very safe.

Its value is based on pure speculation and while that speculation may have some merit, news is what drives price in the absence of facts.
Look through last years ups and downs with each news item, namely China FUD, followed by the 2 forks, CME futures and then the huge wave of alt news in December. This year has been down because of all the regulatory exposure and banks tightening credit for cryptos with little or no positive news.

That's what usually happens. It was over extended at 6.2k, it went down to 5.9k and everyone bought back in  because it's expected to go back upto 6.5k within the week. If you look at price charts you'll see this up and down pattern everywhere, this is the basic mechanism by which traders make money.
If the optimism wasn't there it would have dropped all the way down to 5.5-5k which is what is expected to happen soon after it peaks again this week.

Bitcoin is due for a major correction as these last few months have been crazy. Medium correction is expected around 5-5.5k while a major correction can go all the way down to 4k before it's ready for the 10k stretch by the end of next year. 
2018 will largely be a down trend for bitcoin and money will flow back into alts so just be wary. As much as everyone loves bitcoin, it can't grow like this forever. There has to be some corrections for healthy future growth.
End of 2018 will get crazy again as there will be more instruments for trading bitcoin and LN is expected to start showing some results.

Coinbase is going to support both chains so your Segwit(vanilla) bitcoin is not going anywhere, it's just that you miss out on the Bitcoin gold and Segwit2X coins.
If you've got even 0.5 bitcoins it's worth it to invest in a hardware wallet (which cost $100) to make sure your investment is safe from hacking and all this other nonsense that's going on right now.

In very simple terms yes it works like a flash drive, a very secure flash drive. Simply put, you send coins using your private key and receive coins through public key. Your public key can be visible to everyone but your private key has to be secure which is what your wallet is for. There is no data stored in your wallet except your private/public key pair, the actual data of who owns what is stored on the block chain which is visible to everyone but only accessible to the owner of the private key.
If you lose your wallet your bitcoins are gone, that's just part of the game with any decentralized system. The responsibility lies with the end user and not with some 3rd party.
Computer wallets are OK, they're better than exchanges but if your computer is compromised your wallet has no protection. There was a post here a week or 2 ago where someone lost 95 bitcoins from a computer wallet which really, really sucks. With a hardware wallet, even if they hack into your computer and get the password and pin for your hardware wallet they still can't steal your bitcoins because you have to physically push a button on the wallet to send coins out.
Anyone who is remotely serious about protecting their bitcoins in the long term uses a hardware wallet.

You're posting crap on a public forum and telling people to shut up. Think about that for 2 seconds.

No doubt but I find it weird that I'm having trouble cashing out and shorting at 6k coz of FOMO.

This is what people don't understand. They think crypto currencies are outside of the "evil" system but in reality they're 100% dependent on the infrastructure owned by the status quo.
This is why gold is always better in times of war/hyper inflation because it is truly outside of the system. Doesn't matter what the circumstances, if you have an ounce of gold in your hands you have value.

It's a simple supply demand chart. The green are buy bids and red are sell and you can see that buy bids are lower in price and quantity while sell are higher in both which means supply is greater than demand which means the price is about to go down.
Basically it signals when to buy/sell for traders.

OK, since you're a newbie here is some advice: Any time you think you're onto a "get rich quick scheme" you should check yourself thoroughly.
Yes bitcoin has been growing like crazy but it's also very volatile and it's also very easy to get hacked and lose your coins if you don't know what you're doing.
I suggest you do some research on block chain and bitcoin first before thinking about retiring early.
PS: $300 investment is not enough to be able to retire at the age of 21 so whoever told you that is full of shit.

Because sending bitcoins to your wallet is a huge pain in the ass.
