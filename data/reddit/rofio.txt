how much are you trying to send? you could reimport your wallet to a new wallet to utilise manageable fees (though slower)
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:52:45
You're welcome :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:57:36
Then it has no use though yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:59:25
To supplement the fees and slow transaction times?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:54:39
You don't set a wallet pass phrase it is auto generated. Had you moved crypto there? When you have it unlocked you can view it as far as I know
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:13:48
This woman just say physical bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:02:54
Hmm on reading it looks like you can try with an empty pass phrase to access your base wallet, and create new wallets with additional passphrases. Maybe try no passphrase if you haven't set one.

Mobile wallets are not as good as an offline wallet. Also you are more likely to lose or have your mobile wallet inaccessible due to damage. Absolutely backup your 12 word seed at a bare minimum.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:37:01
Fees would make your purchase irrelevant

I'd suggest using living room of satoshi to clear any other debt and free up more money to buy the dips.

If mt gox coins are moving again TA won’t replicate
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:54:18
Would that be the case? I thought it would bounce off the ionosphere
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:39:38
Fair enough, I’m continuing to accumulate but low margin leverage on poloniex to try to catch the bull runs on eth monero or stellar

Yah well done, trying to claw my way back after wiping my self out 6 months ago 
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:36:28
Ouch, that's gotta hurt. Are you actively trading now?
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:52:43
There is a document on pirate bay for mastering bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:31:40
The system overloads at critical times meaning you cannot trade or exit trades. They have a back foot with more bandwidth and priority to trade however earning money while retail trades are frozen
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:21:49
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:14:23
Solar flares could cause this very easily
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:11:03
Yeah it’s worrying particularly how frequent that site overflows and stops you from entering or exiting trades. It would be interesting to see them taken to court in a class action where they had to prove they had not intentionally caused overflow to rip off retail investors because that sure af is what it looks like
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:28:37
Are you buying through coinbase?
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:39:16
Personal finance gave me advice against buying a property 16 months ago. I've now held it for 12 months and had not a single issue. At most it's cost my $2000 for the year pre-tax my tenant has signed another 12 month lease and my income ($95,000) can cover any short term issues. They wanted me to have a emergency fund after dropping deposit on an investment property and paying ahead on my own mortgage for 6 years..
@_date: 2018-10-19 10:58:43
Wasn’t bitcoin gold a scam spinoff?
@_date: 2018-10-19 08:55:52
Because it became bloated and fees got prohibitive yeah?
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:13:27
Neat I'll give it a try
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:56:26
What does interbank mean in this context?
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:57:01
Interbank sounds centralised to me, what does it mean in this context? Exchanges?
Edit: why am I downvoted for querying the word interbank in a bitcoin context?
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:11:30
Sure give it a go and report back on your earnings lol
@_date: 2018-10-19 08:31:26
Why do we need these layers? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:16:18
Does it have a price floor above zero?
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:00:24
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:03:18
Oh the digital gold proposition? But why the extra layers is it still bitcoin if it has a visa layer next?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:44:07
Same amount
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:43:22
Check out the transaction id or post it here
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:42:49
Usd or unbacked usd-tethers?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:44:40
Was it resolved? I hold a mixed portfolio but am considering exiting if unbacked usd-t are going to crash the market
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:25:52
Lots of people trade the rapid rise and fall to accumulate more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:57:27
That means nothing
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:38:23
You can pull this in trading view btcbch

I've heard great things about doge coin, where can i get some?
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:34:03
Subbed, after visiting the Doge cafe in Japan it is a must

Honestly this wouldn't be bad to get a chance at more cheaper coins before $10k
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:19:39
Why would this be deleted..
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:08:10
link it?

Oh it's on poloniex now i look
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:29:34
Wow is that yen? The numbers confused me for a second then I realised that fiat value is completely arbitrary. Long live bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:34:55
I'm interested having worked with people with blindness or low vision. I understand there to be a number of free or government funded transcription services in Australia. Where are you based? If a company required it to be translated /transcribed for an employee it may be government funded to avoid anti discrimination laws
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:43:31
Oh congratulations I feel like bitcoin will be huge in India with the crackdown on the paper money economy

I have a friend running for Mayor of Sydney in the next year or two, sponsoring her campaign and having her promote Bitcoin would be win win.

Use block explorer to check the transaction. You need 6 confirmations and it is probably still pending.

I’ve closed my long at 8888 and debating re-entry or short 
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:43:23
You should probably just use fiat if your goal is to buy products. Btc is a major trading pair if you are investing in alts. Bch has some trading pairs on some platforms however has been delisted from others
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:10:32
Nice chart, are you bullish for $10k this run up?
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:46:06
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:18:32
You think its going to go to three percent growth like fiat?
I highly doubt it thus my reason for investment.
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:37:31
Although there is a finite supply and by the laws of supply and demand a non renewable resource will increase in price over time with sufficient demand.
If bitcoin is seen as digital gold and a store of wealth it should continue to rise unless it collapses completely to be worthless.

You should actually name it Pastor Corn and have a link for donations to the Church of Bitcoin
