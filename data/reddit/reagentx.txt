Whatever you say, champ.

I take it you don't read the first paragraph? “Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.”
What I meant by “the information surrounding bitcoin trading is not widely available and put to use.” is that statements and information that corporations are required by law to provide their investors is nonexistent with bitcoin, there is no bitcoin monetary policy, and people choose to speculate on value rather than make an accurate appraisal.
Hope that clears some things up.

I don't recall calling BTC a stock, perhaps you should reread the article so you can understand what I'm saying. I'm perfectly aware of how BTC works, like I stated earlier beyond retail it has no value.

Fundamental analysis looks at both qualitative (business model, governance, target market factors etc.) and quantitative (ratios, financial statement analysis, etc.) aspects of a business to see if the business is currently out of favor with the market and is really worth much more than its current valuation. Bitcoin achieves this how, exactly?

You're using a computer right now to post to reddit, sounds to me like gold has plenty of intrinsic value to you.
Furthermore, unlike bitcoin, if I don't want gold, someone else will. This is not the case (at least, not nearly as wide) with bitcoin.

Among these are the fact that it is the most malleable of all metals, extremely ductile, a great electrical and thermal conductor, and that gold it is chemically unaffected by air, moisture and most corrosive reagents.

Except bitcoin doesn't make it easier for me… I have to convert it to USD to do anything legally in the corporate world; I can't send BTC to my studios as it fluctuates in value too much. USD is comparatively stable, even with QE (which I absolutely disagree with, don't think I like the fed). From a purely utilitarian aspect, bitcoin has no place other than for retail. Even [CheapAir admits]( that when they take in BTC, BTC is useless to them as they need to convert to USD to pay their subsidiaries.
What I mean by "among these are the fact that it is the most malleable of all metals, extremely ductile, a greater electrical and thermal conductor, and that gold it is chemically unaffected by air, moisture and most corrosive reagents." is that gold has value outside of transactions, whereas bitcoin is useless.

What happens when 21 million bitcoins isn't enough?

Divisibility != overall value. 21 million pieces can be broken but if the coins don't have value people will just move somewhere else.

Not really, and gold absolutely not.
