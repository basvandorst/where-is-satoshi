Disruptive technologies always appear ahead of their time. The bitcoin of the 2030s will make the current implementation laughable by comparison, akin to the evolution of the internet.

I've seen plenty of analysis on this sort of thing. The pattern has repeated every single bull run so far. In fact if you look after 8 in 2014 you can see the flat and slight uptrend that precedes the bull run. 
We appear to be in a flat zone at the moment. Bottom found, waiting for the steady rise that precedes the bull run. Of course major news could catalyse the run, or put it off longer.

I think adoption will be an exponential kind of thing. It will need a big player like Amazon to spark it into being taken up seriously. Obviously who knows when that's going to happen, I just don't see it in the next 12 months. 2 years is certainly optimistic, you're right.

People care about the ETF decision because it will trigger the next bull run. The coin has bottomed out and is now heading sideways before its next run, however there needs to be a major market move to trigger the investor chain reaction. The ETF decision is exactly the sort of thing to do that. Lots of money entering the market and fomo leads to another spike. Bitcoin is still at least 2 years away from mass adoption, so in the short term the next bull run is what many investors care about.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:40:45
That's fucking embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:49:42
That's exactly my point. They are promoting bitcoin cash as bitcoin. So to many, it appears as there is a lot of negativity and in fighting in bitcoin. 
BTC supporters are pretty unified, as you say, but that's not the appearance to the average user looking up bitcoin for the first time.

It gives cryptocurrency legitimacy in the financial world. I now lures bigger players into the market and when the currencies begin to snowball, the casuals join the bandwagon. It's an important statement, though nothing we haven't already seen. It is fairly big though.
@_date: 2018-08-12 19:34:37
I agree completely. However as more money and business come into the cryptosphere those kinds of issues get solved a lot faster. The talent pool that some of these businesses have is insane. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:06:00
Because you're trading with exchanges, aka little banks trying to operate under local laws.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:17:41
Huh? When people jump on the bitcoin to the moon bandwagon, with no idea what cryptocurrency trading is they just whack it into Google. Bitcoin.com and  are a front for BCH so its easy for them to get duped into it. 
For someone who is hearing crypto for the first time from a BCH shill will easily be led to believe BTC is a soon to fail fork of BCH and that's where to invest. Especially as they refer to bitcoin and bitcoin cash synonymously. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:29:24
New users yes.

How much in it?
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:26:26
The problem is bitcoin users are in two camps. Those that follow bitcoin BTC and those that follow bitcoin cash BCH. Each refer to their bitcoin as 'bitcoin' and many are pretty aggressive at support for each others coin. This creates a lot of negativity in the community. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:46:10
I wouldn't even mind if he was trying to promote BCH being the true vision of what bitcoin should be. But calling BCH bitcoin is just wrong. BCH forked and BTC took the majority of market capital with it, keeping its name.
It shouldn't even matter. If your product is superior, then great. What he is doing is simply trying to pump his product through outright deception. Convincing people to invest because they think BCH is BTC is unethical and outrageous for a so called professional. 
He is an absolute asshole.

Something has to be a hybrid between our current economic system and a fully decentralised one. It's very difficult to go from one to the other without everyone being all in. If bitcoin helps the transition then great. So really we do want institutional acceptance because it accelerates the movement towards what people really want.
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:03:33
Haha 
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:33:33
I was speaking more about the paradigm of what people want bitcoin to be, not what it currently is. One of the biggest criticisms of crypto is the need for KYC, which is needed for taxing, while bitcoin by design is traceable I often hear people talk about the desired final product to be untraceable for privacy. I just can't see it in the short term, and so we get hybrid use cases involving companies like Bakkt.
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:09:40
That's a bit of a stretch of an analogy, the economy with the holocaust. I frankly refuse to outright blame a person working in my local bank to make ends meet. He/she didn't decide on how our capitalistic economy would develop nor do they have any control. We should be concerned with raising the technological competency of our aging and dangerously tech illiterate governments.
Whether people like it or not, the fact is that millions of people all around the world depend on the industry and until you can transition the changeover of the industry there will be an overwhelming and insurmountable resistance to any disruptive technology to that industry.
We know banking is broken, we know that people at the top are generally terrible human beings, but to think that any stable government is just going to say "fuck 'em" and switch over to an unproven new economic system is incredibly naive. I hate banks as much as anyone else, I truely believe that crypto will become the mainstream way of moving assets from person to person around the world. I don't know whether thats going to be bitcoin, something else, a mixture of the two, or even if the governments with develop a single agreed digital currency and ban everything else. What I do know is that it won't be tomorrow, next month, or next year. It will be a slow and transitional process that will face a lot of challenges along the way. It's ok to accept that and not be some kind of traitor to what crypto is trying to do.
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:35:51
Some people are never satisfied. I love how people want a product that defies the very convention that the worlds economy is based upon, and then scoffs when in the beginning there are certain strings attached during the transition period. Believe it or not the world isn't going to adopt this untraceable, untaxable paradigm of currency that puts millions out of job overnight. One small step at a time indeed.
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:39:06
I asked the same thing on twitter. From what I can gather the answer is people are upset the head of the blockchain analytics group Neutrino had a shady past with a start up called hacking team. 
I understand the moral reasons as to why people are protesting, however this isn't a partnership that will negatively affect or change the service that Coinbase supplies. It's all past baggage from what I can tell, and people don't want to put money in this guys pocket.
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:04:57
I get why people object to helping finance a bad group of people, but there's no evidence that this in any way affects the function of coinbase. 
Anyway I thought we already didn't like coinbase because they subscribe to KYC and are centralised. 
Each to their own but I'm sure coinbase will continue to be a good on/off ramp into crypto. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:37:05
I mean we're talking about millions of mothers and fathers who support their children with income from that industry. We all hate the big fatcat bankers that this will screw over but we have to be honest and accept that there is a lot of innocent people in this industry just making a living. I'm simply saying that we need to expect a transition period similar to that now with the renewable energy industry. We know it's better but it's too disruptive too occur at once.
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:22:23
Not that I believe you can make a price prediction on BTC accurately but it does follow fairly predictable patterns once the bottom is found. It's not unreasonable to suggest past performance may indicate where future surges might go, and that is a huge range to be fair. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:31:36
For many users it probably is completely fine. 
Both Coinbase and Binance have invested heavily in security and are very secure platforms now. They simply have too much to lose if they get hit with another hack. 
It is of course good advice and good practice for users to store their bitcoin on a hardware ledger. However for new or inexperienced users there's a huge amount of unnecessary hysteria about keeping small amounts of crypto on exchanges for convenience. 
Unless it's dirty then it probably is safe enough on a big exchange like Binance or Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:19:28
I'll be honest I thought CCN was a bot that pieced together articles from key information on crypto scraped from other sites. If this is a Google change to reduce visibility on low-effort clickbait articles then maybe they should change their approach.
@_date: 2019-06-09 10:18:24
Not really. South America, Europe and Russia use commas whereas North America, UK, Australia and Asia use a decimal point. Africa is about half and half.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:23:02
I agree, I think this is the more likely scenario. Transactions are difficult to identify from the outside but relatively clear internally. I would like to see GDPR style laws be introduced to ensure addresses are handled correctly but this seems a more reasonable compromise.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:16:35
These arguments get raised a lot and I know a lot on here strongly supportive of uncompromised encryption and anonymity. However I am yet to hear anyone on here explain just how we deal with basic, fundemental issues like monitoring illegal activity, preventing terrorism, and goverment taxation of individuals and buisinesses.
I know a lot of people are downvote heavy with these topics because they don't agree with them personally but as a functional society how do we deal with these issues? Do we pretend they're not important, do we pretend businesses and individuals won't abuse financial anonymity? I hear the dialogue of why we need encryption and anonymity on here all the time, but never about solving the fundemental issues that prevent its adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:25:36
sounds perfect but how? What police work? How do you break groups who by nature won't reveal elements of their crime until it's too late. 
When people can connect completely anonymously, can trade resources completely anonymously and act without anyone else being involved, how do you stop that? What level of police work breaks that up? 
Currently almost all anti-terroism, anti-trafficking and anti-child pornography is done by either surveillance or being reported by a family member/friend. Even then the effectiveness is limited. No amount of indeterminate 'police work' will replace that. 
I'm very much a supporter of privacy but I am yet to see any reasoned suggestion of how we replace the prevention systems we lose. I don't believe the majority will support that sacrifice. We have to find an alternative system that enjoys the best of both.
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:30:21
Agreed. Remember this was catalysed by a large order and a FOMO response. That's now stalled and any large retraction in the market will cause people to sell their positions crashing back to lower levels. 
I think if we can create a stable range in the current price area we can expect more gains in the months to come, as news and perception of BTC positively improves. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:20:40
I live in a country where taxes literally make society function. Literally every facet of the society I live in is paid for using the money gathered from income and corporation tax. It's easy to say 'let people keep their hard earned money' but when schools/hospitals/public services aren't functioning because they're financially unsupported things break down.
We are a long way from being able to function in a taxless society.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:11:21
As someone who has lived in UK all their life. I can catagorically say that we use a point as a decimal point (eg. 1.00) and a comma as a thousand seperator (eg. 1,000,000). I have no idea where you got the idea we don't from, however it is not correct.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:07:54
Well I live with socialised public services, inluding healthcare and the like so it obviously would affect me more than in America. In the UK people are more accepting of tax due the reasons I've stated. 


That doesn't mean we have to make it worse by removing the ability to finance any public services. I'm not sure you could expect them to be happy with having a completely privatised society.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:58:02
I get the frustration but isn't this just a company following their legal responsibility. Crypto doesn't mean you can just use it for what you want, irrespective of what the design goal behind it was. The truth is that companies that handle your crypto as intermediaries are accountable for upholding their legal responsibilities in that region. 
People who want to avoid legal issues like this should use exchanges that don't require KYC information.

You have zero proof or guarantee that the rape charges are fabricated. The guy lived by choice as a matyr and avoided the charges, likely in the hope of staying locked in limbo until the statute of limitations on the rape charges was up (mid-2020).  
I personally don't agree with the US charges against him for Wikileaks, however a man doesn't (potentially) get a free pass on rape because he did something that in your eyes was heroic.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:57:49
I'm suprised people still think BTC will be used for small OTC transactions when other projects are much more suited to that. BTC has got itself a nice niché as an intermediary currency like gold, there's room for more than one currency certainly at the beginning of global adoption. 
It's very different to want to pay for your coffee through an instant trustless network, as opposed to transfering huge amounts of money across international borders, or even a business smart contract between two global entities. BTC can peg the different niché currencies together, and thats ok.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:40:14
SEPA payments? In my country you can do direct bank transfers which occur faster, mine typically within about 30m-1h. 
Also if you ignore the price as soon as money hits the account and decide on a set limit order price that you want to pay, the natural price volitility will usually get you your crypto in a day or so anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:24:30
Interesting, thanks for taking the time to give me some insight.
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:31:45
The point is that it isn't necessary. Looks like he's using coinbase which means he could bank transfer the money and set up a limit order on coinbase pro for free. 
He paid $7 fee when he could have paid $0. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:29:18
I don't know what it's like in US but here in UK it takes between 30m and 2hrs for the bank transfers to complete. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:56:20


Is this not just proper security though, moving large amounts of cryptocurrency into cold storage where it is safe until withdrawl demands increase. It reduces the liklihood of hacking attempts if they only have the minimum amount of crypto needed live, akin to a bank keeping cash in a safe.
Thanks for the overview, I see what you are saying. Is this why decentralised exchanges are becoming more fashionable? Are there any good ones?
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:26:32
Well there goes one of BCHs props. Can't wait to see the crash when they are forced to dump their entire holdings to cover their losses.

Can someone explain what Proof of Keys is?
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:29:09
Ah right ok. That sucks, I assumed coinbase would be equally easy to use in the US. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:01:18
You mean withdrawing to your bank account? In the UK you can deposit from a bank account and use those funds within an hour or two. No charge for that. 
Withdrawing takes a working day or two but as it's in fiat its not a huge issue. There's a £1 charge for that.

I don't believe hyperwave can account for the more complex emotion led economics going on with cryptocurrency. However if you do want to go down that route, if anything it's showing we are at real risk of being in the first part of a strong bear run down to near $1000.

@_date: 2019-05-05 13:40:38
I'm unsure how people convince themselves that because something doesn't subscribe to their personal requirements that its a non starter. A successful crypto doesn't have to be decentralised, sure many people want that, but it's not a requirement. If Facebook make a currency that they can use on their platform, integrate it as such and then give 1bn people access to it, I don't see how it can't be a success. Not everyone demands decentralisation, not everyone requires anonymity, and these people are more likely to be using this exact platform. 
Crypto will contain several, perhaps many, currencies with niche roles. Not one that fulfills an ideological pledge in complete opposition to modern economical norms.
