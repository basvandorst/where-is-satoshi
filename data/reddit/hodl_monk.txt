I don't have the firm hands to actually hold to such a price point, but if I could change anything in the world that money could change, I'd like to fix Social Security by creating a private version with official tax advantaged status that could not be raided by the owner. Sort of like a REALLY long term version of a college scholarship, like all the way from birth to retirement, that would showcase the true power of compound interest, or an 'at cost' (ultra low fee) 401k, that didn't raid the plan with huge fees, either one could change the world radically, just by teaching the true power of interest, in a way that nothing in the world currently does.

Bitcoin will NEVER be a safe buy. The safest thing to do is to buy it cheap. Chasing the trend is just more risky, because your basis is higher. It can't go up forever, there is a limit, and the higher the market is, the closer to that limit it is.

I wish I had gotten some bitcoins when I was 10 ... They didn't exist, but it would have been a hell of a lot better present than anything I actually got, which have all been broken, used up, or disposed of. It just shows how transient almost everything we buy nowadays is.

Its like this -
China - We want you to give us your ports for our ships to use, in exchange for all these worthless dollars you keep sending us, like all the other east Asian countries have done.
USA - Talk to the ICBM....
This is the backing of guns. China routinely forces lesser countries to turn over ports and other infrastructure to them in exchange for nullifying their unpayable debts. That is not going to work on a country whose worthless paper money is backed up by enough guns, regardless of how much debt we owe them, or how many dollars they have to buy our ports. They have already tried to buy one, it didn't happen, and not because they didn't have more than enough dollars...

I would say of investments that have been around 10 years, Bitcoin is probably one of the most risky, and the most rewarding. I mean without leverage. Its just nothing like stocks or real estate, it does its own thing. They call it pure TA, since there is no earnings or rent to confuse the issue. I try not to chase momentum, but that is a valid strategy as well, but it might leave some money on the table, since the long term performance of Bitcoin as been one way.
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:01:11
Of course there is survivor bias, but Bitcoin didn't rise up from a sea of competing crypto like the iPod emerged from a crowded mp3 market, Bitcoin was always the number 1 crypto, even going back to the white paper's publication, so if someone was given a top crypto in the last 10 years, it was probably Bitcoin. The hard part would have been to not sell it in that time, since Bitcoin became easier and easier to sell, as time went on.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:08:08
With so many out there, its unlikely that you will pick the next Bitcoin, or even if there IS a next Bitcoin, since crypto is well enough known that you are unlikely to get in on the ground floor of anything, with 10,000 people looking for the next Bitcoin...Its kind of like comics in the late 80's. Once people saw that the old comic  were worth a lot, everyone just went out and bought 5 copys of every new  comic. Those are all in the discount bin for $0.20 each, and only the old ones retain their value, and for the same reason.

Bitcoin will not replace money. It probably won't even be worth more than all the gold, but it could still go up a lot from here. There is however a practical limit to the price, and that is the cost of securing the network. As eco freaks like to whine, it already consumes all the electricity in Iceland. As the price increases, the number of miners also increases, but there are only so many Icelands on the planet, so there is a hard cap to how much juice we can realistically waste on mining, before enough large countries cut off the juice.

Clearly there are winners and losers in every market, but everyone investing in Bitcoin outside of a one and a half month period at the end of 2017 and held is ahead at this level. Because the price has increased over the long term, there are more winners than losers, and when it recovers its all time high, every investor that held will be a winner, at least until the next bear market. Yes, this is a market you do not want to hold on the downtrend, because it goes WAY down, but then it also goes way up. The average person just wants an unobtainable rate of return to not just spend the money, so they can ether deal drugs, do some other clear scam, or Bitcoin. This is just what young people need to be motivated to save. Its too risky for you, and that's OK. I'm glad something exists to motivate young people to save, even if some people lose their shirts.

You think that is a mind fSk ? Try this one. You own a United States Treasury inflation-protected security, and the principle adjusts for inflation. NOT counting the interest, just that adjustment, which isn't actual gains in purchasing power, but is explicitly just inflation, is considered a taxable gain. There is no reason for government to ever stop printing free money, cause it just makes them more free money, no matter what you invest in, if you cash out at some point (!!!)

I like renewable energy sources, they are great, but there is still a hard cap on total energy production, renewable or now. Although energy production does increase, it doesn't increase 400 % in a year, like Bitcoin has done. We should have a world currency, to avoid exchange charges. It will probably be the Libra, unless a truly decentralized alt gets gUd real fast. Bitcoin is just not going to do it for actual RL use, unless its charges get massively reduced, and its other flaws fixed. Maybe with some kind of awesome second layer, but that clearly isn't ready yet.

Looking at the last two bitcoin bull runs, buying in 3/4 th of the way to the ATH would not have been the world's worst  time for an investment. Yea, there was a better time, but if there is another bull run, there is still plenty of money to be made. I think its very unlikely $14 k is the top.

Suppose you want to buy some shitcoins on Binance. Well, what do you need to own to buy those coins with ? Is it dollars ? Is it USDC ? Most likely no, because those things don't have base pairs with most coins. You need Bitcoin (or Eth, for the larger coins), and that gives Bitcoin a lot of its value over other coins. Its the same with Dollars and US taxes and debts. Because you HAVE to pay them in Dollars, there will always be demand (a market, and a market value) for dollars, even if only to bridge to those debts. Even if everyone were paid in crypto, you would still need to have dollars at least once a year to pay taxes, or maybe every three months, depending, and thus there would always be a value and a market for them.

People who own $20 of Bitcoin will leave it on the exchange, but if they were to move it in their own wallet, it would cost a huge percentage of the total in fees. 'Fortuantely' CB locks tiny amounts of crypto so you can't move them, until you are over a certain threshold. That $10 in free Bitcoin you get from your first $100 purchase was dust in my account for a few months, until their system automoved it to CB pro, and then I was free !

Yes, a lot of people lost money in the brief time over 10,000, but a lot of people lost money when the silk road article came out, and it crashed from $30 to $1, and again when it first hit $1000 and fell off. Despite the high risk of this asset, the long term trend is up, WAY up, and everyone that held on in the past was made whole and then 10x over that, if they waited long enough. There may not be enough money for everyone to cash out at the current price, but there is not enough money for everyone to cash out of Tesla stock, either. You just have to hope for enough 'greater fools' to buy it off your hands, and so far, that has been the case, both for Tesla and Bitcoin, and unless it stops working as a crypto, there will probably be someone to buy it off you going forward, even at these prices. That is how markets work, and so far, they are working, to find the correct price, whatever that is at the moment.

This would be a very hard thing to have global consensus on, just because some countries are so much richer than others. Many third-worlders would probably want every penny they could get right now, and wouldn't want to spend on healthcare, when they are hungry or in a civil war. Its really more of a 'two world' situation, where the west has completely different priorities than most of the rest of the world. I stand by the importance of compound interest. IMO, it can solve all of the other problems that are currently solved by printing money and debt, you just have to save some money, invest, and then ride the wave. There are so many gainZ to be had from compounding, understanding it will make the other mysteries of the modern world, like the rich getting richer and gentrification make perfect sense to the masses, which is probably why they don't teach it in school, I doubt the elites want the competition in the asset game !

Interestingly, there is an exception, and that is Forever Stamps. If you use them as stamps, you don't have to report inflation gains on them, as far as I can tell.

The military does not so much support the economy or dollar value, but the military prevents others from taking advantage of the current economic situation, no matter how dire it becomes. If some south-east Asian country has some economic weakness, then 'all their ports are belong to China', and that won't happen for the US, regardless of if we default on all our debts. The military actually acts like an economic 'get out of jail free' card, allowing us to never have to really face the music, regardless of how much we screw the economic pooch. The economic strength of the dollar comes mainly from the economy, but also because we can't really be destroyed as a country by a bad economy. Essentially its like the 2008 financial crisis. Because our 'Too Big To Fail' banks could not actually go into receivership, i.e. they had an effectively infinite backstop from the US FED, they were in a much stronger economic position than others that didn't have those backstops, so if you cannot fail, people 'trust' you more, which is why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able to keep getting low interest loans, because they literally could not go to zero, with their implicit (and now explicit) guaranty from the US government.

This may be the wrong place for a serious discussion of the uses and risks of Bitcoin, just because most people here are moon/lambo bois with maybe 0.1 BTC, and high on the hopium, but I will break it down for you. Bitcoin CANT be shut down, because it is decentralized, that is one of its biggest selling points. It IS legitimate, but it is HELLA RISKY, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You could easily lose 50 % from here, but you will NOT lose it all, as long as you don't use leverage, because BTC will always have value, as the base pair for almost every crypto exchange, and its ability to move vast amounts of wealth across borders trivially easily. The thing to realize is that Bitcoin has been the best investment of the last 10 years by far, and there is a rather significant chance to put up 100 % + returns, as we already have three times that for 2019 already (!!) So its a gamble, but the odds are you won't lose if you hold long enough, and the possibility of winning big is there.
One more thing, it usability as an actual currency is terrible, with Lightning still marginal, $5 fees, and 30 minute waits, you ain't buying coffee with this any time soon.

Clearly (I think) Bitcoin cannot have an infinite value. TrU believers like to compare it to gold, or dollars, but why should a poorly functioning token that just happened to be created first have such a large value ? I can't answer that, I just hope that it has one more go, so I can have my chance for mad gains. Maybe this is as high as it can go, maybe not, but the move up of $10,000 in 3 months, strongly implies that there might be more to go, but no one can know for sure, it really is just digital fiat, or even a kind of collectible, its hard to know for sure.

Sadly, a lot of FOMO n00bs really don't understand Bitcoin and dumped it after the fall, so that loss can be real. The buy action at the top was intense, so even though it was not there long, lots of chumps own(ed) it from there, so probably still out 40-50 %
I don't understand your idea of Bitcoin, it seems to be something different for everyone. For me, its a lambo generator, and to actually generate said item (not the actual car, but a different high value purchase for me), I expect to gradually sell off Bitcoin, when the next parabolic move gets us way over the ATH. I also want some sound money, and no inflation, but it just seems like a fantasy, as no one actually USES Bitcoin for anything, and most of the spend sites are credit card conversion fee generators.
I'm not suggesting owning alts, only that the EXAMPLE of most alts performance shows that its not inconceivable that a crypto, even Bitcoin, might actually stay way down for a long time. Now so far, we are bounced back real nice, but almost all alts have not had that type of gain, and there is no guaranty that there will always be a huge bounce in the future, as I think the halvenings will start to have less effect, as the inflation rate approaches 0

You are SO wrong, there is no way in HELL that the 'average' 401k has a total fee structure of 0.45 % Every 401k I have ever had the misfortune of being in had a higher fee, 0.8% was the very best of the sad bunch. Maybe its different if you cap weighted all the STEM companies that will never employ me into the mix, but my RL experience is the opposite of that pretty statistic.
OK then, on to the actually wrong point, 401k's are not tax free, but either tax differed, or Roth style taxed once. I mean, its still good, but not THAT good. The traditional 401k will tax you on the full amount, contributions + gains, at retirement. This is still good, because you got a lot of compounding in the meantime, but its still taxable. I far prefer the Roth, which taxes your contributions up front, but then all the gains are tax free at the end, and there is no mandatory withdrawal, either. 401k's were a great idea initially, and the match could make their high fees work, sorta, but without the match, they are nothing special, unless you have a good employer that makes them special, either by getting you that fantasy 0.4 % fee total, or by eating the fee for you.

Network effects are very powerful, but they are also limited by the medium they are big in. Take Blackberry. This product had huge network effect, just took over the corporate mobile email market. The problem was, something new came along that did email almost as good, but also had apps, and music, and facetime, and better phone. That is the crypto market. For now, only gains matter, and thus Bitcoin is king, but someday we will want something that can actually transact at Visa levels without fees, and that will never be Bitcoin. Its not even a matter of can a alternate crypto do those things, it is a matter of when we actually get serious about using those cryptos in transactions. So far the market just isn't ready for real world change, but someday it will be, either because the tech gets better, or maybe governments will screw up the fiat system, and people just bow out en mass.

Maybe, maybe 100x could somehow be possible at the outer edge, which is great if you got $1000 in BTC, but then Bitcoin would be more valuable than all gold and fiat on earth, so even another 100x is a lot more of a stretch then the moonbois think, at least compared to traditional financial markets. Even if this Citadel-living fantasy comes true, this total Micky D expense would only come to about $500 after 10 years, rather high for fast food, but not so much as to be anything in the range of a lifetime regret like dropping 10,000 BTC on some pizzas. IMO, the best thing to come out of the whole crypto space is the ethos of saving money. I did a lot of dorky things in my youth, but nothing quite as laughable as saving all my earnings and being an epiK cheapskate. But somehow, every dumb hobby I had has become cool, at least for a moment, and now, in a rather unbelievable fashion, even saving money is cool. No one regrets buying some pizzas instead of buying Microsoft stock, even though almost everyone over 40 did this, but somehow Bitcoin is different. It clearly isn't fiat, and will probably never be fiat, but somehow it bridges the gap between wasting money and getting rich investing, even when every other moon/lambo stock, or real estate bubble, or even collectible card game just could not highlight the stark difference between consuming today and winning tomorrow.

Hmmm, of course some smaller banks died before Lehman, but they weren't big enough news to be remembered, at least I cant remember them. I'm sure the bailouts were started under George W Bush. I'm not excusing Obama, just not giving him all the credit. Clearly the Lehman decision was made under the Bush administration, as was the start of the bailout program. Obama didn't have the sack to stop the bailouts (or the illegal drone murders, which he ran against!), because the party differences really are not as big as they are made out to be.

Fiat gets support because its better than gold for small trades, and it works pretty good 99 % of the time. Also the risks of fiat are abstracted away, since it inflates in a slow and regular way, so smart people can avoid inflation. Unless they screw it up, we are probably stuck using fiat. Only time will tell if negative interest rates screw fiat up. So far, its still working fine, at least for day to day purchases.

Show me any 401k with a total fee structure of 0.04 %. Go ahead, I can wait . . .
You are thinking of a strait vanilla Vanguard index fund with that 0.04 %, the problem is, every 401k I have ever seen has some kind of wrap fee that covers all plan assets, AND a fee for each fund. And that wrap fee tends to be big, very big, the lowest I have ever seen is 0.75 %, and I have seen much higher, 1.5 % to 2 %, and most 401k don't offer Vanguard index funds, but even if they did, the wrap fee so dominates the cost structure that it wouldn't really matter.
Don't get me wrong, I like the concept of the 401k, but the actual implementation at most of my employers is poor, and most of them stopped matching contributions, so the logic of contributing isn't there.
Yea, Bitcoin usually has a buy fee, but it tends to be fairly low, in the 0.2 % range, and no annual fee. The annual fee for 401k's will kill you in the long term, as it keeps compounding, year after year. I had a 401k with a 1.2 % total fee, even in the index fund, and those fees were more than all my other investment fees combined (index funds), by a factor of 10 (!!)

If both parties want to transact in crypto, even on the level of real estate, then it can be done, although the paperwork will probably have to be rewritten for the alternate currency. So far, most businesses won't take it, so there is a way to go on that front. Clearly things could change to a non-bank world, but so many things need to be done first. A way to billpay with crypto will be needed, as well as a way to get fiat from crypto, and crypto from fiat, without a bank account as a bridge. I doubt there will be a way anytime soon, even most Bitcoin atm's cant accept crypto and give cash, at least at this time.

It is in fact the coin you are thinking of. The reason Visa is not worth far more than gold or Bitcoin is it isn't an asset, it is instead a pure rent seeking corporation that eats a set fee from all transactions, a lot like a miner mining Bitcoin after the block reward goes to zero. A crypto that had all of Visa's transaction volume could be worth a lot more than Visa, just from the network effect, and the demand for the coin. Visa's credit that you spend isn't an asset, its a fiat loan, so 'owning' several credit cards really isn't an investment, just a convenient way to get some loans or float, but if you owned a lot of a world reserve crypto, especially one with no inflation that starts with an N and ends with an 0, that could be worth quite a lot. Of course, since that coin has vastly less transactions than even Bitcoin and no adoption, its really just the hopium speaking, but we can all dream of a crypto world where such a possibility would be tested out at the retail level.

fSk the miners, they are vastly overpaid now in huge block rewards for worthless 'security theatre', where they just dump the price like every day. So far, PoS coins are fairly safe with 0 miner fees or rewards, just run by 100 or so crypto fans. Mega Whales can always run their own Bitcoin miners as their 'White man's burden' to secure the network, if the miners fall off.

Based on the relative amounts of money and gold in the world. If Bitcoin goes 100x from here, then it is more valuable than all the gold and money in the world. Why would that happen, until it has actually replaced those things ? Yes, I know replacing those things is 'the dream', but on a practical level, it hasn't, and that still seems far away. I could see replacing gold, that could happen, but it would require a lot of gold lovers to capitulate, and I just have not seen that happen.

Lehman Brothers was the canary in the financial coal mine. Once the Powers That Be saw that just letting the market take its course would lead to a domino effect panic, THEN the magic infinite checkbook came out to make it all better, and secure everyone else their annual bonuses. Lehman just had the really bad timing of being the first to die in a pro free market anti bailout administration. Once the house of cards that was the derivative CBO addict market started falling after Lehman, the administration changed its policies. I'm not big on bailouts, but maybe they were needed, to some extent. I just wish the terms of the bailout were harsher, not in terms of Dodd frank mega paperwork BS, but more in the no bonuses until main street recovery kind of way. I don't believe for a minute that the 'talent' leaving would have crippled these banks. IMO, a few less hot shot derivatives traders finding something else to do might even have helped the world, even if they got together to form mega risk bank, which would at the very least isolate their cancer from the rest of the banking sector.

I actually agree with his assessment that someday Bitcoin will be replaced with a better crypto. The flaw in his logic is the classic 'the market can be insane longer than you can stay solvent'. Usually that applies to shorting a stock, but it also applies to taking a contrarian position, and although he could still be right eventually, no one will care, because in the meantime Bitcoin has become the best performing investment asset in history. The broader thing that he missed is that very few people actually use crypto like a currency, and most people treat it as a global get rich quick scheme. Bitcoin may be a flawed payment system once the number of transactions rise over a certain level, but as a digital collectible to hoard, it is unmatched. Its mind share is huge, and its supply is low and getting lower.
I think there is still a reasonable possibility that another crypto eventually becomes the global peer to peer electronic cash the world needs, but the hard truth is, it doesn't matter. All the gainZ will have been had in Bitcoin, and anything else is likely to be mostly monetized by its creator and insiders, like Facebook shares, which remained private, until 90 % of the total value was accrued, only to be dumped on the public once its success was assured. Don't get me wrong, Facebook shares were not a bad investment, up 10x since 2012, but there was 1000's of x that only insiders got, and that will likely be the fate of any Bitcoin killer, which is actually one of the things Facebook is working on... :O
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:11:03
What I meant by replace, is to replace the white paper dream of electronic cash, not the actual real use case for Bitcoin now, the place of speculative honor that Bitcoin holds. Bitcoin IS the new gold, and the life blood of all crypto exchanges, and that is not likely to change, and the gold bugs are in for a shock on this front. However, I think at some point we will ALSO, in ADDITION to electronic gold, want a replacement for cash, for feeless micro payments, and lightning is so ludicrously complicated, and needs to be always online, and can cause you to lose 4 BTC if the power ever goes out and you cant recover the exact current state of your channel. This will never be the future of fiat, its just a massively inferior and risky experience, even versus just using inflating paper, or fee-happy credit cards.
You think nothing can ever be like Bitcoin in its creation myth, but there are over 3000 coins, and not every one is an exit scam (just most of them...) I can imagine a coin with those circumstances, a completely free coin airdrop, that all the undropped coins were burned, and the developer burned off the entire small development fund selflessly perfecting the protocol. I like to call this deep alt the other n-word, because even daring to say its name is an autoban in this forum, but rest assured, its origin story is almost as good as Bitcoin's immaculate conception, and can actually do everything that a transactional fiat currency would need to do, even better, and without the inflationary manipulation of the current system.

Just because something is unlimited does not mean the value will go to zero. We have unlimited amounts of cotton-linen paper, but yet the US dollar still somehow has 6 % of its 1913 value, no matter how rapidly they print them. Well there will definitely be quadrillions of sub $0.01 crypto shitcoins, we might still agree this first one should have value, even if the rest do not. Its really more of a social contract, rather than the ease of creation of these things. I would be shocked if Bitcoin ever zig zagged its way down to $1000, much less $0. Yes, there is no real world value in these strings of random characters, but we could still decide that they do have value, if its part of a limited run that we decide to believe in.

At the moment, the only real use for crypto is coin's value go up. As long as that is the case, Bitcoin will probably stay on top. However, if people actually start buying coffees (and everything else) in crypto, and its not a stable-ish coin like Libra, then the network effect could kick in, and even a much lower value coin might just start rising in the way Bitcoin rose in value over the last 10 years, and once the gains started getting stupid large, it could draw Bitcoiners in. So far, nothing has risen like Bitcoin, although for a time Eth was generating more X'es, that didn't last, but a true world crypto currency might be too difficult to ignore.

Its hard to consider the central banking system as a 'rigged' system, because it is functioning as designed, it creates new money and fractional reserve lending as its mandate. From the word go it was set up to manage the nation's money supply to smooth out the ups and downs of the economy, and clearly had a government mandate to adjust the money supply. I was reading books in the 1970's about how the system functioned, and it never quite seemed right even then, as the system didn't seem capable of ever getting back to a steady state. The only real difference is that we now think that another deflationary currency could do a better job.

There is really no reason to trade an index fund, so on a practical level, you are only paying tax on maybe 1.5 % dividend and occasional Cap gains. If your marginal tax rate is 25 %, that comes to about 0.375 %, making the tax deferral not even cover the fee :(

Not really. If you already have lots of stocks, and stocks are at an all time high with lots of indicators pointing to recession, its not a bad time to slip all your current income into a moonshot asset that can now be invested to yield 6 % on top of the possible moon/lambo, and might not correlate too much to the stocks.

Bitcoin could some day be a currency, when the get rich quick part ends. This could be something like the US railroad system. Once upon a day, this was just as nuts as the 1999 internet stocks, and everyone was starting a railroad company with insane debt, racing to build redundant lines across the country. Now, its just a slower way to get from point A to point B, and the costs to use it are fairly stable. This thing cannot go up forever, what happens next is unknown. It may just be a high fee gold, but the ability to settle across borders without censorship will always have value, and its so much better than all the other current options, I'm sure it will find a boring use case.

I agree. I think the vast majority of coins that have not moved in 5+ years are lost forever, and the market cap is inflated by 30-50 %. I'm less on board with the Tether FUD. I am not ruling out that Tether may be fractionally reserved, but for now I accept their argument that they cannot get a formal audit of reserves, because no one wants to take any risk of becoming the 2020's Arthur Anderson, just for a few milli in auditing fees. I hope that Bitcoin can eventually reach that level, but I cannot see it happening before at least 5+ years from now.

Bitcoin is a worse currency, but a better store of value. It just needs a good way to spend it easily and quickly. Everything is trackable, the fact that you can no longer mine your own Bitcoin all but guaranties that the government will know how much you have, when you buy it with fiat.

No one knows how any of this works, this is completely new technological territory. For every Hydrox to Oreo or Myspace to Facebook, there is a eBay or amazon that just nailed it on day one and was never overtaken. Perhaps the entire mechanisms of Bitcoin can be overhauled to make micropayments workable, or perhaps there will never be a need for a transactional crypto, and we stay with the fiat system. I'm betting more money is made in Bitcoin, but the logic of a much better crypto doing the coffee is really solid, even if it still hasn't happened in the real world.

Dai works as long as people want to take out loans with variable interest rates from 1- 20 %. That might be OK if you have a ton of Eth, and no fiat, but the value proposition seems iffy. If they can't get that rate lower, I doubt many will be borrowing Dai.

"Altcoins may be neat, but make sure you actually know what they do, and if they offer any improvements over other types of crypto. Similarly, don't dismiss them as altcoins just because they have that title. Do your research."
Every alt offers some improvement over BTC, but we all know that doesn't matter. I would be REAL careful with any alt, just because the fall was so hard, and the (dead cat) bounce has been so meh.
"Educate friends on how the tech works instead of trying to get them to join your investment strategy in a cult-like fashion."
Why bother ? The tech is great, the UI/UX is pretty poor, the actual RL use is still almost nil. The only reason to own crypto is to be in the cult, full stop. If you don't have the faith, you can't hold in a 90 % drop. Nocoiners just don't own investments with this insane a risk profile, and I wouldn't invite anyone in who wasn't interested in 'drinking the crypto kool-aid'

Do you think that Bitcoin will also lose value over time ? Only asking because the trend has been solidly up for the whole time Bitcoin has existed. Clearly many alts will never hit their all time highs, but Bitcoin seems to always end up higher, after a few years. Just curious, why didn't you jump on the profit fountain, if you have been here since 2011 ? I mean, even if you were on the sidelines for a while, you still could have gotten a solid 100x from 2015 till 2017, and that ain't chump change !
@_date: 2019-11-04 17:42:17
The problem with real flesh and blood people is they get WAY too emotional about investments, and I am not above that. I myself got burned on alts before finding my way here. The average new Bitcoiner can't handle that level of loss, and more often then not sold at 6k or 3k. Now anyone that looks at the chart, and didn't put their rent money in this knows its coming back, but that is only about 50 % of the herd, and the average person has very little patience.
Its not so much a Ponzi scheme, but like a new insta-gold. Suppose an asteroid brought the first gold to Earth today, exploded in the upper atmosphere, and dropped it everywhere. It would probably only have novelty value at first, but gradually people would start to mark up the price, as they decided it was really worth something. This is what I think Bitcoin is, new and better gold. Bitcoin will not be infinitely valuable, but until the price gets up to 'right' there is 'free' economic value to having it now, even if I missed most of the early mad gainZ. So yes, people WILL pay me money for what I want, if they decide they want digital gold. I personally hold no gold gold, and I doubt I will ever need digital gold, but I can USE it to get some quick gains, waiting for that greater fool, which I am fairly sure will FOMO in sometime in the next two years. And since I got in fairly near the bottom, the downside is limited, IMO.
I do agree that thousands of coins will not, and actually can not bounce back, just because there isn't enough dumb money to re-inflate them all. I am still an alt coiner in my heart, and (you won't like this) there is an alt that, although it may never moon/lambo, could very well someday be electronic cash. You already know it, its PoS, fast, feeless, with no mining, but I'm not going to get banned from this sub by using the other n word ;)

I lived through the inflationary 1970's, let me tell you what happened to stocks, they cratered, the PE was down to like 6 when the decade was done, wasted decade, stocks just went up and down. Earnings were good, but the PE ratio just tanked. Current stock PE ratios are in the mid 20's, pure nose bleed territory. I actually don't think price inflation is coming, but if it did, it would not be good for stocks in the short term. I will however point out that 1980 was like the best time ever to go long on both stocks and bonds, so if there were an inflation run, you would want to pivot out of sound money back into Fiat World, once the interest rates got back up to normal (Where they have not been in decades)
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:24:24
This is correct. But which is the better fiat currency, gold or a crypto ? Honestly, gold isn't even better than our current printed cloth-linen, much less an electronic version.

I don't pay $1 + fees on anything. I also only own Bitcoin and no nano, but if I was actually going to buy anything physical with a crypto, and they took it (no one takes nano), I would use nano, just because I am too cheap to pay on chain fees, and I just wouldn't buy, if a lot of waiting was required.

Also, even if Craig Wright IS Satoshi, which itself is highly doubtful, it is unlikely he has access to these early-mined coins. His time locked story seems absurd, and if he DID have actual access to them, there would be a huge incentive to have sold some of them already, and to have settled the matter with the estate, in fiat, back when Bitcoin was worth much less than now. Also, he has actually lied several times under oath in this case, that we have verified already, so the chances that this isn't a lie are VERY low.

There are two philosophies of money, one that is conventional wisdom that whatever can be printed without causing too much inflation should be printed (loaned out, buying selling securities), and the other that only the additional money that is needed should be created, keeping prices fairly stable. I am aware that most money is created by banks re-lending deposits more than once through fractional reserve, which is only loosely controlled by capital requirements, usually. Clearly in 2008 the creation was much more explicit, but I fall into the second camp, and would like to see more stable prices. I'm not sure what the best mechanism is to achieve this, but I think cryptographic-ally secure money could be a part of it, and maybe once the speculation dies down, we can get serious about some ground breaking economic experiments to determine how to do this.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:10:18
They should have created a crypto with the supply limited in code, completely public ledger, and it should have been a feeless Dag coin, not NEM or Dash, but honestly, if it actually worked and was released, that would have helped a lot. Exit scamming your own countries official sovereign currency is Alice in Wonderland weird.
Its absolutely impossible to back anything with a hard foreign crypto that already exists like Bitcoin. WHAT would they trade for the bitcoin ? Socialist countries don't sell their mineral rights.

Yes, this is an argument that inflation can't hurt those without money, but someone is always holding dollars, even if most poor people spend them fairly fast. I have seen several poor people who have some dollars on their person, just to pretend or show off that they have money, even though they don't have a huge amount, and I know that I and my rich friends are not holding any fiat, so I think that, on average, most fiat is held by the poor, or by the well off to the extent that they actually immediately need it.

I'm as far down the crypto rabbit hole as it goes, but also hold plenty of stocks and real estate in the real world, and I can tell you that IRL crypto isn't that much of a thing, YET. Someday maybe that changes, but for now, its just a cool way for dedicated geek/cool millennial to get a Lambo, and that is fine, but the big picture is much farther out than you think.
Real people dont save, or have lots of money sitting around to put into digital money. We are the far outliers, everyone else just spends all the fiat as it comes in, and owes huge amounts of it to colleges, and banks, and mattress companies, and auto dealerships, and so on, and so on, like almost everyone at my place of work has a car note. People WANT their government to spend money it doesn't have for welfare and missiles, and they WANT to spend money they don't have on cars and furniture and stuff. No one IRL wants to hodl until their stack grows enough to afford that stuff, all the grasshoppers want it N O W, and if a crypto were the new fiat, they would ALL be RUINED, when their debts mooned, and then we would be back to worthless fiat, because that is what the no coiner debt-ies want.

The global financial system depends HUGELY on debt. You don't see it, because you (I assume) don't need or want lots of debt in your life, but the vast majority of first worlders depend on debt, and debt needs a 'soft' currency that can be counted on to not deflate, and wipe out the current system.

Life is a gamble, and you would be WAY ahead if you gambled on Bitcoin. Yes, it could all go to crap, but its becoming way less likely, as it just keeps going up. Very few Ponzi schemes got wiped out and came back 3 times in 10 years, the price performance in fact makes Bitcoin seem way more legit than many other things you could hold, including actual gold. IMO, Bitcoin will stop mooning and just be gold at some point, and be remembered as the 2010's Rubix Cube. BUT, this in no way means that it can't be the best investment in the next 5 years. IF you are going to gamble, this is at least as legit as massively overpriced real estate or stocks.

Inflation is bad, BECAUSE it enables corruption, and payoffs of the elites. Why are economists so morally blind to the fact that government GIVING FREE MONEY to itself or Evil Bankers for hookers and blow is not fair to the rest of us ? If inflation is so good, right and just, as you have just claimed, why not just give the new dollars to the holders of the old dollars ? WHY MUST YOU STEAL FROM THE POOR TO GIVE TO GOVERNMENT OR THE  ELITES ? ?? ??? Serious question, I KNOW you won't discuss it, because you are blind, blind to the facts, oh you are, because you are watching that garbage, strait up garbage - Public Enemy
So, inflation may or may not be useful for pumping and dumping the economy (I mean 'managing', but that managing inevitably just means nothing more than more debt and more inflation, all day every day, like a heroin addict, until the inevitable crash), but why is the WAY the inflation is handled good, specifically that this free money should go to government and bailouts to people who are Too Big To Fail ? No one has ever answered that, which is why cryptos aim to take that power away from the elites and government. There is no reason We The People can't have a mathematically set inflation rate, or even just add new crypto coins when needed, instead of trusting the very fallible government to manage the number of cookies in the jar, when they clearly can't help themselves but take and take and take...

What I meant by accountablitiy was, there is no recourse with Bitcoin, you THINK Satoshi is dead, but if his coins move to Coinbase and dump, and Bitcoin goes to $1000 and stays there, you can't call Satoshi and ask for your life savings back. Same thing if you misstype a send address by one letter and your funds are lost.
The last Bitcoin inflation bug was caught by a Bitcoin Cash developer, so certainly not in Bitcoin's infancy. Any code update can include more bugs, even useful things like Segwit, so you never know 100 % its bug free.
There are actually advantages to censorship. If you want to buy illegal drugs and fund terrorists, because you are a bad person, then this is your coin, but if you actually DON'T want to do those things, and face the consequences, its better that your illegal transactions be censored by your bank, rather than expose you to unlimited liability. I don't actually know all the countries I'm not allowed to send money to, but my bank does, and they can protect me from legal problems by censoring me, which can be useful for eBay sellers that sell internationally, as I once did (!!)

The 'spending and investment' argument for inflation comes up a lot, but it kind of implies that the economy is a delicate snowflake that will melt away without massive government theft of private property at all times, and I don't agree with this assessment. If my money is neither gaining or losing value, there is still incentive to invest, if I want gains over time, and I do. I would argue that the small taking of people's money does not encourage spending much, because if you don't want to lose money, you would tend to invest over spending. People spend because it is what they want to do, and I don't feel that coercion is appropriate to make them spend faster.
Clearly volume is not enough to stabilize a currency, it needs to be adopted as well. Gold is an interesting example, because it was used as money in the past, and was stable enough in that role for thousands of years. In a way, volume + adoption seems to be the thing that evens out a currency. Also, once something IS a currency, its fluctuations matter less to its users, because it tends to look more stable, if only prices outside your area change, like with free floating currencies.

Yes, if you met your goal, and are balls deep in a parabolic move up, hodling can have outlived its usefulness, but once you are down a lot (over 50 %), the logic to bailing out goes away, and the logic that this asset is likely to retrace all of its losses in 2 years becomes much more compelling, so its all circumstantial. There is also a third variable. If your gainZ are EpiKly Epic enough, you may just not need spending money anymore. If 85 % crypto losses don't affect your lifestyle, and you don't need the money, every up at bat can be a 'swing for the fences' event, and thus you can hold through anything, if you think the 100x force is still with this coin long term.

I was referring to income, which is slightly different from wages, in the way it is taxed, but not so different that those dollars should be disregarded in the statistics of what people earn. I don't have the details in front of me, but I believe that income slightly outpaces inflation, but does not equal GDP growth, on average.
I actually do know some people in the 1% as my family are mostly in this bracket. We still have wages, and THOSE have not kept up with inflation, but we also have income from passive investments, pensions (good luck getting one of those, millenials :P), and capital gains from crypto, and those keep us ahead of the sheeple that only have wages. This is the world we live in, so if people don't save and invest, they will gradually fall behind, because its a global world, and the US and the west are the high cost producers, so those wages are just not going to rise like its the 1950's...

I realize there may be some care in where the new money goes, at least if it isn't 2008 (wow...) but the fact of the matter is, inflation isn't free. When you add a bunch of new chips to a poker game, with the same prize pool, you are taking money from someone, so it REALLY matters who gets the new chips, and there is a lack of clarity on who that is, but clearly its bailout money, and government spending money, I mean, where else could it have gone ? I'm not an economist, but the poker chip analogy makes a lot of intuitive sense to me. Its been suggested that the QE money was used to buy securities, but that also has specific winners and losers, and I would think that this benefits the already wealthy, who own the vast majority of the securities, so by default, those funds must have come out of the pockets of those whom don't have invest-able securities, i.e. the not-wealthy. A system of reverse Robin Hood almost by its nature is unjust, and probably has lead to asset bubbles, and gentrification, and other societal ills that seem to come from nowhere.

I think we could have a 0 % inflation target, but the Fed is afraid of a small amount of deflation, so they don't take risks, when they probably could. Any fully adopted transaction  crypto will likely stabilize to dollar like levels of volatility, once it is widely distributed. When a money-like is held by only a small subset of the population, and only for speculation, it almost by nature will be highly volatile.

Inherent properties confer no value. Its classic if a tree falls in the woods, does it really make a sound situation. I could (maybe) send a server on a spaceship to mars and create Marscoin, and it could have the same exact features as Bitcoin, but its value would be close to 0, because there is no one on Mars who WANTS it.
The reason Bitcoin has value on Earth isn't that it takes electricity to mine it, or rarity, its that lots of humans want it, this is the only reason. There are cryptos out there with much more limited supplies, harder to mine, and secure, like some with only 200 coins, but they trade super low in value, because they are shitcoins that no one wants.
The utility of Bitcoin comes from people having it and being willing to use it for something. That something is mostly trading and gambling and drugs, but those are real use cases, and they confer a real value, that something like most deep alts doesn't have, because even though most of them functions better for transactions, no one wants them, so they remain shitcoins.

By the time they realized they needed cheap energy to get magical internet money, it was too late to build the cheap energy.

Umm, come ON, really ? You really can't imagine how government printed money gets into the economy ? It MUST be spent, by someone who didn't earn it, to get goods and services for basically free, stealing the value from everyone else through loss of purchasing power. 
Just because Uncle Sam prints a pallet of hundreds does NOT mean that the goods and services of the total economy have increased by that percentage, only WHO OWNS those goods and services changes, and that change is a taking, although its done in secret, slowly, and is rarely debated as to its justness.
The problem with government 'mathematically' set inflation is, they can change it, and they do, like all the time, because its like the planet Earth's biggest cookie jar, and they have free access, unless they take too many cookies and inflation rages out of control, like the 1970's (can you believe Nixon had the cajones to actually say there was a gold shortage ? LOL), but the temptation will always be there to take more, just like they always raise the debt ceiling, because its easier than living within their means, even if the economy needs to be cooled off, because there is always someone without a job, who wants the stimulus, so it never stops.
The blockchain changes this, in an 'audit the Fed' way, since if the inflation rate were clearly visible on a public ledger, people could see any shenanigans in real time, and if the inflation were set in the software, we would know if too many coins were out there, and could stop it, or just set public nodes to disregard the unjustly created coins. No such audit or control mechanism currently exists is the existing Fed/government structure, so its a 'trust us' situation, and we have learned from experience that they can't be trusted, ever.

The reference to buying cheap is usually about an index. Buying a particular stock that is down is dangerous, because it might be down because it has a specific problem, and never come back. When you buy an index, you own a tiny fraction of a lot of stocks. If you look at the fund's prospectus, it will show you all the stock shares in the fund, but what your share is is way less. Honestly, just pick a good index and don't worry about it, if the cost is low, you win, its that simple. I like Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index (FZROX), this fund indexes the total market, and best of all, no fees (seriously)

The key variable is that the number of bitcoins you can produce is going down soon, so it depends on the demand side. If there is less demand than the new supply, then the price will go down. As the hash rate goes up, the cost to produce also goes up, so part of the price side is miners speculating on the future value. Since there is no real use case for Bitcoin yet, anything is possible, but we are a collector world, and even though hoarding digital money makes little sense without gains, this is not a rational market where I can just go out and make any number of new bitcoins to sell, so if that demand is there, it will not crater in price, at least not long term, as the supply of new coins goes down.

Crypto for everyday transactions is a little bit different than file sharing. There is an immediate gain from stealing songs, but the advantages of a non-inflationary currency replacing credit cards go over most people's heads. Even the hardcore cultists of crypto really don't fully grasp the implications, and are mostly here for the memes and the gainZ. The loss of control of interest rates and money printing would take almost all the financial power away from local and national governments, and could seriously limit deficit spending. Even though I care about such things, its hard for me to predict what might happen if we suddenly left the fiat system we have been on since the 1960's, when we stopped backing money with precious metals, and really kicked off the Inflation Era.

Clearly it would be better to have privacy on chain, than to always take the risk.

As long as there is a functional bond market, the government can always buy bonds. As we have seen in the EU, if the price offered is high enough, this can lead to negative interest rates on other existing bonds, which causes nonsensical returns in that market. Although this requires a private person to participate, if you raise the price offered high enough, its likely a seller will emerge, so essentially, the fed can 'print money', as long as the bond market has any trading liquidity remaining, so they can still usually create money if they wanted to. The bank of Japan also purchases stocks directly, so that is another market where 'printed' money can be pushed into the public, since again, if you offer enough money in an open market, you can 'sell' all the currency you want, until the liquidity is gone, and the stock market has a LOT of liquidity.
Now Velocity of money can go down, and it did, preventing inflation, but that measurement is an aggregate value for the economy, and is unpredictable. Once there is an expectation of inflation, velocity can increase a lot, causing 'thermal runaway' of inflation, making it a self sustaining force, and unstoppable by the fed, without causing a recession.

Its not safe, or likely to ever be exactly 10 %, but I like Fidelity® ZERO Total Market Index Fund (FZROX). I don't believe in inflation, so in nominal terms you will likely average around 10 % per year, there are no fees, and the dividend is about 1.5 %. The way you win with this investment is you live off the dividend, so you don't need to worry about if stocks are going up or down, and your stack just grows and grows to the sky. With 2 milli that dividend amounts to $30,000 a year. I've lived on less than that alone, in the US. Its not exactly boats and hoes money, but at least you are financially independent for the rest of your life, so there is that.

I assume everyone here is already in the crypto cult, so I doubt anyone can be convinced by posting here. The QE, debt, and money printing has been going on for a long time, even longer than Bitcoin has been a thing. In my entire LIFETIME the US has only had a single year in budget surplus, the not in any way bubble year of 1999 (!!), and all that debt had to be paid for somehow... What I am trying to say is, this Trump drama, tariffs, QE, fiat money laundering, all the supposedly serious news that you think is about to tip the fiat apple cart is really just the usual noise that fills RL government actions every year. The fiat faith is strong, and with 2 % interest rates, and infinite digital money printing, they can hold the line on the current system for a lot longer than you think they can, maybe forever. Yes, crypto is great, for many reasons, but it probably won't be adopted by normies and no coiners for a long time, unless something MUCH more dramatic happens with the fiat system, and it would have to be something we don't see, like a Black Swan event, and until that happens, The Way It Is is unlikely to die on its own, even if all of us get Lambos, or bemoan the current system's injustices, because normies are used to the slowly boiling pot of water, and they are not getting out ever, until TSHTF, and it hasn't yet.

Did you miss the 2008 financial crisis ? Its kind of the reason we are all here, and Bitcoin is here. Like, its actually in the original Bitcoin white paper...
Money has to be at least somewhat limited in supply, or it is not a good store of value. If the cost of houses, healthcare, and college doubles, but your pay stays the same, that is a problem. That is a problem caused by Quantitative easing, where new money is created from nothing, and given to the elites, that buy up all the homes, and jack the cost, rent and taxes up. Limited money supply prevents this, because the FED can't just mint another 20 million Bitcoin, and give them to bankers to buy another personal watercraft. It is freedom FROM the powers that be stealing your wealth, by creating an unlimited supply of money, and making the things you need to buy more expensive, without compensating you.

The ideal money commodity should, as such, possess utility, portability, durability, homogeneity, divisibility, malleability, Cognoscibility and stability of value.
Some of this stuff is more precious metals based, but could still apply to the digital blockchain world.
Probably the most important things are that it is hard to counterfeit, easy to move, easy to subdivide, and easy to identify. I would consider an inflation rate over 3 % to be something like legal counterfeiting, and it is surely causing real estate, college, and health care price inflation, even if the cost of physical goods is not inflating the CPI. Money creation is the biggest problem with fiat currencies, although censorship is also a problem for some people. I personally have no need to break the laws of my western country, but I could see many other countries laws as hugely unjust. Capital controls (China, Argentina), fiat seizures (India), bail in's (Cyprus) are the most egregious 'legal' takings in recent history, but there are others as well, including making gold ownership illegal in the US, or even the paying of Continental forces with worthless fiat in the revolutionary war.

I've always thought it strange that Paypal and VISA/MC were core members on this organization, they have the most to lose from a truly transformational crypto-like financial system. Paypal with the ban everyone for any complaint mentality, and all three with the high fees that (I assume) Libra wouldn't have. I was a big supporter of Paypal originally, but once they made the 3 % fee mandatory, even for checking account and funded account payments, I was no longer interested, but they had become locked into the eBay system, so then I was stuck with them :(

Yea, the chances of Euro's going to 0 is low, in the SHORT TERM, but with negative interest rates + inflation, in the long term its all but guarantied to lose all its value, at least in the range of decades. The odds are that Bitcoin is not going to zero, and its not even clear how it COULD go to zero, since no one is really in control of it, and it pretty much runs itself off of pure human greed of the miners, and everywhere they are shut off, they just reopen somewhere else.

Without a good PHYSICAL wallet, you will also lose some of your fiat. Now it won't be all your money in one crypto mistransfer, but I know lots of people that occasionally lose money because it is loose in their pocket and some of it falls out when they take something from their pocket. This happens more than you think.

I doubt that many coins will be lost going forward. Yes, when it was way below $0.01, they were handed out like candy from faucets to n00bs who just didn't take care of them, but things are different now. With the large fee to even move coins from most exchanges, there is a large incentive to take care of them properly, and if you have a HW wallet with a backup somewhere safe, the odds of complete loss are very low, too low to lose many more coins, its just SRSBZ now, so the times have changed.

I'd be a LOT more confident in lightning, if it were being rolled out by many merchants and used. IMO, the problem may be much deeper than technical, as there seems to be no real demand to spend crypto at all in a retail setting, as even newer cryptos that theoretically can handle significant volume do not have any, including B cash, which has basically no real volume, despite being created specifically to facilitate more volume.

I would argue that the market for crypto is highly irrational, and is much more concerned with hype than security or centralization. Now there is a small libertarian group that does value these things, but most of the cult is pure Moon/Lambo. I do agree with your points, but I don't think those are the reasons the market is what it is. I am sure if XRP was the first crypto, it would be the number one crypto by far, despite its clear flaws, in the same way that Bitcoins inherent flaws have not changed its clear leadership, even when fees surged and an Iceland worth of energy was wasted (IMO) 'securing' the network.

Scarcity sets the price, the last sale also sets the price.

This is the capitalist theory, that competition drives all profits to zero, but like anything done in a decentralized way, mining tends to go way overboard, then have large scale failures of miner businesses.

BTC mining is very California Gold Rush, in that its hard to find any gold. Everyone that I have seen speak on it said they would have been better off just buying the coins, and that includes those that got in early. The problem is, at this point, you not only have to be better than huge economies of scale Chinese miners that are well established and have the newest ASICs, but because of their large cost and regulatory advantages, you actually have to be a LOT better, to net much over $ 0. The thing is, this will be a business with investors, so he probably will have to sell the coins to pay whatever rate of return they are looking for, unless this is some kind of Hodl club. Because this will take a long time to set up, he is probably hoping for a mooning, before the coins come, so its profitable. I can't see this working without a large increase in price, since most miners are barely breakeven now.

Fees may be needed eventually, but I would argue with that logic. There are many coins with negligible fees. IOTA and nano come to mind. Clearly you can build a coin ecosystem not based on fees, so why be in one with potentially high fees. Im not big on the 'only big transactions' narrative, its not what I really hope crypto will do for the world.
I get that the power usage protects the coins, but I am SURE that it could use 90 % less to do it. I'm not a security expert, but very few coins have been hacked and looted, beyond the ones that use a Bitcoin like PoW (but have way less hash, so easy pickings), so if security was so bad without bitcoin-like energy usage, why have all the much lower energy alts not been picked clean like Bitcoin Gold was ? It seems to me that the main weakness in crypto is being PoW but not top in hash (!!) True, the other coins have not REALLY been tested, as they have never been the  coin target, but they seem fairly secure, even after years in the market, when SOME hacker should have been tempted to loot, say, an XRP, if it were as insecure as you imply, I mean, even at  there is a hell of a lot of cash to loot there, at least by armored car standards....

The old wallets will be unknown, for a while, but all the new wallets are pretty much known, since all the Bitcoin sold on exchanges with fiat onramps have KYC, all the ATM's have something like KYC, and the rules require that all sold Bitcoin have a name and address attached to them in a database (travel rule). You can also find out who owns a wallet by looking at where the bitcoin came from that went into that wallet. Its hard to see from the outside, but most bitcoin don't move very often, because of the fees, exchange and mining. This means that usually if you got Bitcoin from someone, they were probably KYC'd, and by looking at all the coins moving into a wallet, you can usually guess who's wallet that is, just from the associations, and you could always ask the senders, if it were important enough.

There will be a new new thing/company in the next 15 years that performs much better as an investment than Bitcoin, or maybe an alt will actually be used for transactions, and get big.

Its more than that, you needed to know how to store it, and want to buy it, and have enough money to accumulate huge amounts of it. The distribution of Bitcoin is just as unfair as the distribution of Gold, or USD, maybe even more so, the only difference is that Btc skews hugely to the young nerd set, and the other two do not, so if you are in that subset, it seems very liberating to be one of the have's all of a sudden, since all the gold and USD belong to old men, for the most part.
@_date: 2019-10-17 10:03:10
I don't think if all the current alts were compared to Bitcoin without any bagholders or historical mad gainZ that the market would choose Bitcoin as the top coin. Also, some of Bitcoins 'weaknesses' are actually strengths as a wild speculation, although not in a  'future of money' way. Although I see mining as pointless, it does create an 'ecosystem' around a coin, with a non-creator group working on a coin, and speculating in it, and adding new supply at a regular rate. The halvening also adds a certain excitement level to Bitcoin that the DAG coins just don't have, which makes them less interesting, and gives them an 'old news' aura to any coin that don't have varying inflation, even if their transaction performance and speed is far better.
In the end, it doesn't matter, because Bitcoin has the historical gains, the largest community, and the most mindshare in the public's eye. Its unfortunate that so much of the supply has been lost, but that is in a way part of its appeal, in that the actual supply is unknowable, and is probably much smaller than most people think, since its so easy to lose your keys, and impossible to recover them.

Gold bugs have been proven wrong for decades on their fiat hate, to use the same hype reasons for speculating in Bitcoin draws inevitable negative comparisons. The only reason Bitcoin will go up from here is IF it is still early in whatever use case might one day be found for Bitcoin, and its clear from the recent busts that it won't be crime.
The dollar will not collapse, fiat will never go away, the next recession won't be as bad as 2008. Everyone buying for those reasons is wrong. Now Bitcoin could still go way up, but its more because it is the worlds first global bubble, than any real hedging case. Bitcoin badly needs a real use case that isn't speculating, or its going to get absolutely killed at the end of the next halvening hype train.

US hyperinflation has been predicted since the 1970's, when it seemed like a real possibility.

This belief that we are on the precipice, and somehow the powers that have been since 1913 are going to suddenly kill the goose that has been laying a hundred years of golden eggs in the next say, 3 years or so, is really naive.
Now do I think that this global '2019 South Sea Bubble' can roll on for another 4 years ?

Well, the vast majority of investors still hold no gold as well, in fact, I even won some physical gold in a sweepstakes, and just dumped it, the reality is, there needs to be a reason for investors to own Bitcoin. Maybe that will be new gainz, or maybe it will actually be used for something that isn't criminal, but so far, gainz is the only reason, so its a bit of a chicken and egg problem, as the gainz can be tricky, if Bitcoin is bleeding out half the time. Yes, if you bought the bottom you are still fine, but the FOMO has mostly rekt the new investors, so the flows are slow at the moment, and the leverage markets are soaking up the gambling money, that might actually buy coins in the past.

No its when you actually do whatever is needed to actually take possession of the coins. So you get the coins on date X, that is a taxable gain of their value on date x. This is also the cost basis for when you sell them, so you have another gain or loss on that date, and its long term or short term based on the time from getting the coins (event 1) to selling the coins (event 2). At least that is how I would interpret the write ups. I'll have to look at the actual documents to make a best guess, but if its trading when you get it, it has a value, and I think that is the initial gain.

Poloniex fees are 0.15 % maker, CB pro is 0.5 % maker at the low tier, which is where most of us are. This is a HUGE spread in fees, several dollars at $1000, but there are two problems, Poloniex has no ACH fiat onramp, so you might want to use CB pro to ACH deposit and turn into USDC at no cost, then send the USDC to Poloniex. I don't know why, but it always seems to come down to a two exchange solution, to get the best price. Withdrawal fee from Poloniex is 0.0005 BTC, so you would need to buy more than 0.15 of a bitcoin before taking off the exchange, to get a lower cost than CB pro, which has no withdrawal fees (!!)
[Coss.io]( has a 0 % maker fee, and the same 0/0005 BTC withdrawal fee, but their volume is super low on anything but Tether/BTC, and I don't know where to get tether without paying a fee. Does anyone know where to get Tether without paying a fee for it ?

We are not at war. The Sheeple are asleep again. Maybe in 2008 during Occupy Wall Street we could maybe, possibly have been at war over the financial system, but that was long ago. In the US, everyone is like 'We are fighting a trade war, and we are winning', or 'Impeach Trump now' Note that neither of these Kabuki Theater events have anything to do with the financial system. Yes, populist candidates spend lots of money, but the elite candidates also spend lots of money, if you look at the government spending over time, its gone way up, this party or that, I don't think this has changed a lot recently, over the past. I mean, gov spending is at an all time high, but its ALWAYS at an all time high, the high just gets higher.
Debasing. We are debasing, but the world is soaking it up. In a small way, crypto alts are a part of this, as most alts just pop up, thousands of them, with billions of coins, and just suck that new fiat up. Could crypto 'win' the war on fiat debasing ? Well, maybe, IF we were at war, but we are not at war, like I said. If you are in a room with lots of people, and you don't know who the crazy old coot is, you are the crazy old coot. We are a cult, and we sit in these chat rooms and say down with fiat, and people versus the system, but in reality, its just us saying these things, maybe 2 % of the people, and the rest are fine with Debased Fiat World. It was (and is) the same with the Gold Bugs. They have been saying all the things you have been saying for decades now, and you know what ? Nothing has changed. the rich got richer, the poor sucked it up, and everything just carried on as normal, even though signs of trouble are there, like out of control housing and college costs, and of course the absurdity of negative interest rates.
Your tax evasion fantasy is just that, fantasy. Not only would crypto have to be fully adopted as the new international fiat (almost impossible fantasy itself), but it would also have to be a anonymous crypto like Monero, even though all the regulators are fighting these cryptos the hardest. Then, on top of these other absurdities, you also assume that rich westerners are going to become tax evaders en mass, when 95 % of them currently just dutifully pay the taxes now. Again, you assume full on revolution, when the reality is that the Sheeple are still asleep, and its just your fantasy.
Then we get to the paydirt, your personal tax fantasy, this natural resource tax. This will never happen, because its so inherently unfair. I'm well off, but I would pay almost no tax under the system, I would just live small, buy all my stuff second hand, and avoid it mostly, except for the few things I must buy new, like gas, tires and brake pads. The level of this tax would be absurdly high, to make up for the lost revenue. I imagine it would have to be around 100 % +, because income taxes are so huge. Could it actually be workable ? Maybe, but that tax would definitely wake up the people, that would be furious that the wealthy pay very little under that system, at least if they didn't have huge houses, because it does not tax income or wealth, which continue to grow without limit, in either system, but much faster in a system that didn't tax capital gains or income...

The volatility IS the use case. Bitcoin and Tether are the Alpha and the Omega of the entire crypto ecosystem, the lifeblood of the exchanges, You have the stability of a fiatlike, and the moon/lambo of a risk asset, and you can choose which to hold at any time, and you can buy most other cryptos with them. Its basically legal gambling, but with a much smaller cut for the house. As long as Bitcoin's value grows in the long term, everyone can cash out with gains, unless you use 100x leverage and Bitcoin hiccups...

Clearly being paid in Bitcoin is the best, presuming you have some fiat or source of fiat so you don't have to sell any to get by, before everyone accepts it.
Next is buying off an exchange with KYC. Its just the cheapest option that is fiat to crypto, assuming you are not a criminal, who might have their assets seized or frozen.
All the other stuff is either hugely expensive (ATM) actually dangerous (localbitcoins), requires you to already have other cryptos and has tiny volume (DEX) or requires an absurdly fancy setup, cheap electricity, and or cold climate (mining)

On [coss.io]( you can make maker (limit) trades with no fee. IMO, its  much harder to day trade than play a video game, the competition is much more fierce. Also with such a small bag, it may actually just not be worth your time to sit around looking at charts, even if you can make moderate gains trading.
You DO need to stop buying cryptos from Coinbase, because the fees are crazy huge at 3.5 %. I'm not sure what the alternative is, but I would suggest looking for a fiat gateway that is cheaper, and log into coinbase pro, and see if they have a better option for conversions to crypto in your area.

There is no apocalypse, your money will be worth less, not worthless. Your 2019 dollar only buys $0.06 of what it did in 1913, but its slow, like paint peelingly slow, so slow that the average person just ignores it, until they are 40, and look back at their youth when everything was cheaper in nominal amounts. There could be another huge rally, or not, its playing the odds at this point. If you feel you need the apocalypse to get another 2017, you might as well sell now, because that is extremely unlikely, at least nothing like that has happened in my lifetime, and I don't think its very different this time, as such shenanigans have been happening with debt and money my whole life, and still the system stands, firm as always. Yea, 2008 scared a lot of people, but they can (and did) just print more money and buy everything, and that can always happen again. The system is far more resilient that it looks, and the gold bugs have been waiting decades for the collapse that never came, so why join them ?

I didn't say gold was inferior to Bitcoin in every way, only in THIS way. If you are a scared investment rabbit that wants 100 % safety and fears fiat inflation, stocks, bonds, real estate that can burn, and things that go up and down, then by all means, gold is 'superior in every way' to Bitcoin. But the rest of us are here for lambo money, and gold ain't ever getting us that, even if one oz buys a business suit in 1900, and still buys a business suit in 2019, that is not that interesting for the rest of us, that already have a business suit, but no lambo... Also, Bitcoin is up some bazillion percent since its creation about 10 years ago, and gold is just gold, and that is great, I guess, but not for mad gainZ.

Suppose your wallet got bitcoin from 10 other wallets, and 9 of those wallets were in Tennessee. Well, now I have a really good idea where you live, and chances are, if your wallet is doing lots of darknet transactions (they can see this), probably more than one of those 10 wallets remembers who you are, and might give up your name when questioned, especially if they say you are a drug dealer or a terrorist. Doesn't matter if its true or not, once they have your name, then its search warrant, then they got you. If for some reason they want you, they can get you, the only question is, do they want you bad enough.

It depends on HOW you received or acquired it. If you received crypto from an airdrop or a fork, (or Coinbase earn...) that IS a taxable event, if it traded on the day you received it. Plus, if you didn't check the box, they can see that you had an active coinbase account and then fine you for lying on your taxes, because you DID lie on your taxes, if you didn't check the box...

TrU Bitcoiners have their keys safu, but the other 70 % of the Lambo crowd can't be assed to even take coins off the exchanges they bought them on, so fractional reserve crypto is inevitable. Yes, some buy the top no-coiners will get rekt by borrowers who sell Bitcoin short, but in the end, assuming no MTGox, the lenders will still have their coins, and the price will rise at some point, so I'm not sure if lending is really bad, at least in the long term.

Halving is not priced in, because its hard to know what the demand for new Bitcoin will be after the coins are halved. Humans are VERY short term oriented. The market is right for the amount of coins being dumped every day right now. That Daily Dump has to be absorbed every day, so the market is now priced to where it can deal with the dump. Once the daily dump becomes the daily trickle, then the price could then increase, if the demand continues or increases. For the halving to be priced in now, someone has to step up with new fiat and OTC buy ALL todays dump, and have a contract to buy all the other dumps coming for the next 5 months, each and every day. I personally think this is unlikely to be happening. All other halvings the market only realized the full extent of the supply shock after it happened, sometimes months after, and this one will probably be the same. This market is WAY more sensitive to hype, than some future supply crunch, because we live in the now, and the halving is still quite far away from the now.

Well, lets say the average home is $500,000 where I live (it is !) and lets say each home has a mortgage half that size, not an absurd assumption, if it appreciates 10 % a year, and its been owned for a few years (they are going up at that rate).
Now some people will be up to their eyeballs in refi debt, but many others will have negligible mortgages, its a bell curve, with bulges at the edges. If there are 1 million people in my city, and say a third of them own outright (small/no mortgages), than that is very likely several hundred thousand likely millionaires (Assuming other savings/retirement accounts), and that is just one mid sized US city. There is a sh!tton of rich people in the US, more than any other country (for now) Many of them just live normal lives and you couldn't tell, just because so much of the wealth is locked up in property/retirement accounts.

Well then, bitcoin should have just started trading at $1 million in 2009, if everything in the future is priced in, since halvenings were known and simple to understand, as soon as the white paper was published. The reality on the ground is, most plebs, and even bitcoiners here don't really fully understand the halvening. Probably only miners and ATM operators, that depend on the new coins really get it, and even probably not all of them, either, and everyone else just gets drawn in to the hype like moths to a flame. The average retail investor can barely plan ahead a month, and probably doesn't understand Bitcoin's long term cycles. Look at Litecoin. Did it get way better in the last month ? Of course not, it just got some halvening hype, and moved. With almost nothing else going for it, clearly halvening hype is very real, and not well priced into anything yet, so its still a pretty easy trade to win on, IMO. I would bet we are much higher one year from now. I could be wrong, 10 K could be about the final value of Bitcoin for the next 5 years, everything fully priced in, but i doubt it, I REALLY doubt it.

We already know that 'mining' can work with 0 reward. Deep alt na-- runs 100 validating nodes, run by (I presume) bagholders with no fee revenue and no miner reward, aka pure charity (!!). Since Bitcoin will always have fees, there will always be a reason to mine. Presumably the value will increase such that the miner reward will not drop that much every halving (2x in four years). Another thing to consider is that as the price goes up, the fees also go up. I can send now for 1 sat per byte, which is like $0.07, but if the price were $70,000, that minimum fee would be $0.70, and all the higher sat levels also scale, that is part of the reason fees were high when the price was high, so presuming a much higher price in 10 + years, and we all assume that, then fees will naturally take over for the block reward, and we have like 120 YEARS for the fee to naturally take over. IMO, miner income will never be a problem, even with no changes to the block reward schedule.

We are talking about lending, for years, for interest. When you lend, the borrower sells or otherwise uses the coins in some way, that is how you can earn interest on them. This is the thing that creates fractional reserve Bitcoin, because the same Bitcoin can appear in several borrower and lender's account, because it is bought and sold repeatedly, with only the last buyer holding an actual Bitcoin, but everyone else with just an entry on a website. This can be good or bad, but if the lender institution does not default, it should work out OK, at least for the lenders !

A LOT of how to advice depends on where you live. Some places ban it, some places encourage it. I'm going to assume you live in a western nation that tolerates it, and not in New York City, which has chosen to become the former financial capital of the world, because corrupt politician gotta rent seek, and work for Ripple...
You get started by choosing if you want to buy it fast or cheap. The faster you get it, the more it costs. You can probably get Bitcoin in an hour or so if you just feed twenties into a Coinstar, but you will pay something like 11 -15 % in fees, and you probably don't want to do that, or maybe you do. Most people don't have a lot of patience, and that is OK.
The cheap way is to sign up for two exchanges, one to take bank deposits, and one to trade at good rates. This is a huge hassle, and will take a month, when all is said and done, because most exchanges that take RL money will hold it  for a period of time, and will need your identity documents. There are a bunch of them, but you probably want to use Coinbase and Binance. They are just the biggest and safest. Coinbase takes the cash or bank deposit, and turns it into USDC for free (This is a crypto version of US dollars), Binance has the good rates for purchases, and they take USDC. 
The fastest and easiest way to buy Bitcoin is Robinhood. Yes, this isn't real bitcoin, but if you came here primarily for price go up, and don't want to actually manage wallets and stuff, this is a third option, that will give you price go up, and nothing else.
Is it a good time to buy bitcoin right now ? The answer is yes, maybe. Bitcoin is down in price, but it can always go down more. The real question is, can you handle a 70 % drop without selling ? If you can't, then you probably shouldn't buy it, because it can always go down 70 %, and has done that in the last 2 years, but it can also go up 10x, and if you can't handle the down, you will not be around for the upside, whenever it comes, IF it comes.
You do not have to have a wallet, and there is almost no where you can buy things on the go with Bitcoin, unless its from another private citizen. But if you DO want to buy things on the go, you will need a mobile wallet. You can get free wallets for your phone, but these are not safe for any significant amount of Bitcoin. You can buy a hardware wallet, these are pretty good, if you follow the instructions. You can also just leave Bitcoin on an exchange. Contrary to everyone here, this is probably fine, unless something bad happens. IMO, less than $500 is fine on an exchange, because the hardware wallets cost as much as a good leather wallet, so you don't really need one unless you are getting big into Bitcoin.
Read the sidebar to learn about it yourself.  -------&gt;&gt;&gt;
Mining, no one does this themselves, not anymore. Mining Bitcoin is like taking a pan out to California now and starting to pan for gold in a public stream. You would probably find more value in aluminum cans picked up on the way to the stream, than gold dust you could find in it (!!) It is basically the same with Bitcoin, except that you always have to pay for electricity (fixed cost), on top of the cost of mining computers, presuming you don't live somewhere strange like Venezuela (free electricity, but the mining equipment is contraband), so you will basically be wasting your time, money, and effort mining Bitcoin.

Massively dumb reason. To get a recent airdrop, you needed an older style address. Or you did, until it changed later.

I've never seen an ATM less than 8x the exchange fees. It might be a better total rate, if the exchange dinged you for wire fees and withdrawal fees, but some ATM's also charge back end fees, depending on how exactly you get the coins. Coinstar seems to do this, requiring you to work through their exchange partner, and to DoubleFee-TM you for coins to Bitcoin...

Total millionaires is actually closer to 45 million.
Let THIS sink in : There are not enough US dollars, paper AND digital, for every millionaire to ever own more than about 400 K. Does this terrible shortage mean every millionaire rushing to Bank of America to withdraw bricks of hundreds ? Of course not, because rich people don't want lots of dollars, they want assets, of which Bitcoin is only one of many, and other assets have longer records and pay dividends or rent. This idea that Bitcoins will be either in demand by the rich, or some kind of status symbol like yachts or Lambos is absurd. Rich people will only want Bitcoin to make even more money while it is going up fast. Once it stabilizes, and it will stabilize, and only slowly appreciate, only the internet weirdos and sanctioned regimes will want it, for censorship resistance or the Lulz.

This is a liquidity provider problem. End users will not have to deal with force closing channels, they can just send their Lightning funds to an exchange that supports it, or spend it, instead of closing the channel. IMO, end user Lightning wallets can just be custodial and small, and thus avoid this entire issue. Yea, yea, not your keys, bla bla bla, but this isn't for storing $40,000 online in a hot wallet, this is for buying your coffee (theoretically), and you don't really need your keys for $100 or less of spending money.

a 15x from here will easily get over 100k, if there is even half another moon we will get there, and we are talking infinite time to do it. I think its almost certain in 10 years.

The problem keeping Bitcoin from mass adoption is . . . no trU hodler wants to spend Bitcoin on coffee before the next bull run, or calculate the capital gains taxes on 500 sells.
I just sent a bunch of Bitcoin off for 1 sat per byte, on chain, from a non-segwit wallet for like $0.07 Yea, that took an hour, and during next bull that will probably soar, at least for a few months at the next ATH, but for 90 % of the time, fees are very low.

Custodial wallets can have little or no fees, but your point stands. If Bitcoin was worth $1 million, a sat would be a penny, and the fees could reach credit card levels, at even the absolute minimum of 1 sat / byte, and it probably wouldn't be possible to transact at that fee level.

It will go over 20 K, in the long term. You just need to hodl until the next bull run. Now that bull could still be a while, maybe even a year or more, but there is no reason to believe Bitcoin is done, at least not yet. Too bad a LOT of people have the attention span of fruitflies, so its likely the trU Hodlers will accumulate a lot of quitter's coins, before they come back at the next ATH to buy our coins...

Like every lender company that pays interest on crypto has an IOU system for Bitcoin. Celcius, Blockfi, and soon Coinbase itself will borrow your crypto for interest, so speculators can dump the price. When your Bitcoin is loaned out, you effectively have an IOU, and some other speculator has your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your crypto, but you do get interest, so its exactly the same as the current banking system, except that the interest is decent.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:28:44
Bitcoin could bring financial discipline, if people start to actually use it for spending. The block size limit prevents large scale adoption of base layer bitcoin, at least for ordinary people to use it. Maybe someday lightning will work flawlessly, and all the complexity will be abstracted away. But I think IOUBitcoin will be used custodialy by most people, at least in the near term. Do I think crypto can pay 6 % interest in the long term ? No. But for now you can get a decent return, and if you are just hodling anyway, why not get paid to wait, at least until Bitcoin is more adopted and spendable, or it moons again ?

I think the issue isn't with banning blatant scams like Bitconnect, or even 'pump' videos. In fact, other blatant scam videos are still up on Youtube right now, promising to double your crypto, if you send it to them first. The REAL problem is the unjustified or not even explained censorship of crypto, and other things, without any reason offered, beyond some vague form letter. Until the reasons for the banhammer are clear, it just seems very unjust, as some really old videos are getting strikes and bans, and it just doesn't make any sense to have a huge crackdown at some random time, when they never did this stuff before.

The Swiss franc was well known for being produced in limited quantities, and it became something of a hedge in times of crisis. There is a difference between a small and a large country doing this, and they were forced by the ECB to print more money, so as not to kill their trade with the EU. Bitcoin was printed at a high rate initially, because they base supply needed to be issued, but that time is past, which was the point of this article. Next year the rate will drop to less than 2 %, and it only keeps dropping. Inflation of Bitcoin is probably too low for the money of a modern nation, but it is a great speculation, since there won't be much more going forward.

Scarcity is determined by demand. Many coins have fixed supply, but with much less demand than bitcoin. It doesn't matter that they don't inflate, because there is still more coins than there is demand. Lite coin didn't spike after its halving, because there are more coins than there is demand. The halving just reduced its hash rate, with no real effect on the price.

There is plenty of worthless fiat 'out there' to put into Bitcoin. The problem is, there are too few people just staking sats. All you need is enough people shoveling fiat into sats to more than cover the mining coins, and the price is on its way. Even with the price history, there are just too few people moving fiat into Bitcoin. Everyone gambling with leverage isn't helping, but that is how FOMO works. Most new people don't get in when movement is sideways and uncertain. At some point in the next 1-3 years, things will start going up again, and then, and only then, the masses will all pile in at the worst time, and get rekt, and we will get our $100,000 price, at least for a few days, before the rekt-oning...

Also consider lending platforms like Celsius and Blockfi, lenders there own IOUBitcoins. Now these don't trade or move, and are not real Bitcoins, but they feel like real Bitcoins, at least to the lenders, who are just hodling them, in either form. Thus if you asked everyone how many Bitcoins they had, the number would be more than the number that exist, if lost coins were counted, so the total number has increased, even if some are book entries, this is not unlike fractional reserve, as the same asset can be lent out more than once. This does create risk, not unlike fiat currency lending...

I own Bitcoin because it has the gainZ, lots of them, at least historically, but we are kind of stuck in a range for a while, a maybe we will even be in a range for a while after the halving, its just a drifting market, so I wouldn't mind some interest while I wait. Is it 100 % as safu as holding my own keys ? No. But some people are willing to take some more risk for more gainZ, and I am willing to take more risks, or I would still be all in stocks.

I think that percentage is wrong, since inflation is still 3.8 % now, But that 1 % or whatever amount of new coins is ALWAYS sells, the normal volume is buys and sells. Yes, day to day the normal volume dominates the price moves, but in the long term, the supply drying up will have a long term effect, even if its 1/2 a % each day, it IS each day, every day, for the next 4 years, and it doesn't stop, its not like the miners will increase the hash rate and bring more coins to market.

Your credentials are cool and all, but I'll just point out that Bitcoin is neither a business, nor a conventional financial asset. You can't really compare it to IBM, or a municipal bond. There is literally nothing like it before it was invented, and a vast amount of it has either been lost, or is just waiting to crush the market, once the price gets insanely high.

Its the definition of a taxable event. Swapping some altcoin to some other altcoin is not really spending, nor taking profits, its just speculation, and you have not withdrawn any cash, so it makes some logical sense to wait for some actual cash to be produced to actually tax it. Its very likely that a lot of people got rekt, but still had 'profits' before their alts went down 95 %. It also makes life WAY simpler to not have vast numbers of trades to track values of, since you may not know the fiat prices for a coin to coin swap. Having done taxes on each swap before, its a nightmare, and makes crypto trading not worth it, unless there is a lot of new fiat at the end, which so far there is not, if you got in in 2018, unless your timing is good.

The mining logic for PoW alts is different. Unless the price really starts moving up, hash rate will probably just fall off. The logic of the halvening events really depends on being a top tier coin with price growth, and B cash just doesn't have that at the moment.

The annual inflation rate for the United States is 1.7% for the 12 months ended August 2019 compared to 1.8% previously, as published September 12, 2019 by the U.S. Labor Department. 
Now you may think of the US labor department as a scammer, but its really all we have to go on, unless you want to make your own index. I believe it includes rent and fuel, but it may not match your personal spending. Core inflation leaves out food and fuel, but this isn't core, its the full level. I personally think the measure may not count everything fully, but without making my own statistics, there is no way to know for sure, but its probably pretty close. In my personal life, I avoid most of the costs that are radically increasing, by owning a condo long term, and not buying anything I don't need, however, if you live in a desirable city, your rent costs could be radically higher than average. Gasoline has actually been coming down in price, until just now when it spiked, or you may mean some other fuel I don't use, like heating oil, and I couldn't say. I'm pretty sure I dodge most of that inflation with personal choices, but sometimes you have to pay it, depending on your lifestyle choices.

You and I both know our 'progress based deflation' is being eaten up by fractional reserve and money printing. None the less, certain things are getting cheaper, like Chinese TV's, at least they were, until tariffs brought the cost back up. Anything that is mass produced in a Chinese factory can come down in price, at least after the initial hype wears off. You can actually opt out of the 'inflationary rat race' if you only buy used, or scavenge what you need.

51 % attack is always possible, if a coin's hash rate is too low relative to Bitcoin, and they all are, because Bitcoin has all the hash, and that is unlikely to change. PoW just can't work a second time, no one is going to let a coin get big enough in hash to be safe, because there is so much money in raping PoW alts before they get big enough to be safu. 
People here in the crypto cult only laugh at corporate coins because they are so late to the game, but realistically, they have a large chance at adoption, just because of the endorsement of a large corporation, and presumably they can airdrop or offer bonuses for the use of their coin on their goods

It difficult to know which coins are lost, and which coins are deep hodled. I'd say the odds are 90 % - 99 % of the 5 year inactive coins are lost, just because of the chaos, criminal nature of its early use, and lack of hardware wallets (or even decent software wallets) in the early days of crypto, but there is no way to know 100 %. Its entirely possible for one or more early wallets to suddenly become active again, IMO, its not going to happen, but it very well could, and that could shake the market a lot, since only a small fraction of the total Bitcoin is actually traded on a normal basis, and even the single remaining MTgox cold storage wallet has roiled the market when it moves, and there are wallets out there with a lot more than 200,000 bitcoin.

Fiat isn't hard money, it is constantly debased as a matter of course. Bitcoin will be king of hard money, because its easier to store and move than gold. Fiat will likely remain the unit of account, at least until a true fiat killer crypto is adopted for everyday payments. This is a lot further out than it seems, since most cryptos that can actually transact millions of transactions per second are deep alts with no market share yet.

"Both the House and Senate tax bills call for cutting back Section 1031 to cover only real estate. The two tax bills are filled with controversy, but not over this point. In that sense, the debates over 1031 exchanges of cryptocurrency may not be relevant too much longer."
This bill ended the ambiguity by defining Like kind to only be real estate, but before its passage many people DID claim crypto trades as like kind, so it COULD have been done, at least for a time.

Yes, you are probably not going to do a 1 billion dollar transaction in nano and trusting it 100 % to go through in one second, that will be Bitcoin's 10 minute for sure wait forever, but your coffee works just fine for a 1 second online confirmation. No one is devoting thousands of miner computers or fake master nodes to double spend your double latte purchase, and an alt will do this small shit, and it will be fast, very fast, and there are a lot of them currently live and working that can do this, so it won't be B cash, or doge, or Litecoin (Bitcoin code variants), I'm sure you can see this, its really obvious. Most large market cap coins will linger on, zombie like on the charts, but they will have infinitesimally small volume, (like most of B cash's volume is one weather app !!) and the alts that have real use will be fast and low fee transaction coins, banker coins (secure, but controlled by them), and maybe some Eth-likes that can actually bear the load of a billion smart contracts.

You could put a few grand under your bed and probably there won't be a fire, but when you are a European retirement plan, its a little more risky to store (or even just to get) 100 million euros in cash. I believe such plans are required to hold a certain percentage of their holdings of 'safe' bond assets, and with almost all bonds in the eurozone negative yielding, well, there you go.
This is also a lack of imagination on the part of most financial experts. Clearly these assets need to move to more risky investments. Apparently there is little desire for risk in the EU, and the result is this farce.

[crypto.com]( is Hong Kong based, and they seem legit, they have been around a while, and I have heard only good things about them. In this space, you never know 100 % about something, you have to go with what other people have used and worked for them
Never heard of genesis-mining, but there is another problem with the whole concept of cloud mining. Look, small individuals can't make money mining anymore. Even with free electricity its still only small time payouts at best, and you clearly don't have the capital to buy decent mining hardware. There is no easy money to be made in mining crypto, whoever is telling you to do this either does not know, or has never done it themselves.
Edit - after a little research, I have discovered that cloud mining is not mining with computers, but instead you lease someone else's computers to mine over the internet. This has two big problems. First, there are a huge number of scammers in this space, because it requires you to pay them upfront, and scammers LOVE that, so its really hard to tell if any cloud miner is legit. Second, WHY would a miner lease you their hardware, instead of mining with it themselves. In other words, why would they offer this to you, if it was a good deal ? The answer is, if they lease their miners to you, it is because they can't make much money themselves with it, and thus you are likely to not make much money either, if any.

You want to log into coinbase pro (same login as coinbase), to an ACH debit from your checking account, this will let you avoid any card fees, and buy for less commission on CB pro. Wait a week or two until the money arrives, then place a limit order under the current price for the amount you want, this will get you the lowest cost (maker), and will hopefully get it all at the same cost basis, which will be important for taxes eventually.

There is also a Like Kind Exchange tax exemption that you might use for real estate or stocks, but it is no longer allowed for crypto. Why ? Its just an arbitrary ruling, it could have gone the other way as well. In the end, what is taxed and what is tax free is a purely political decision, and its not going to be the same everywhere.

Early for RL adoption, late for the gainZ. Everyone stating Bitcoin is still early fails to note the important difference. Adoption has to be crazy-high to get more than 100 x from here in the next 10 years, while the eye popping 200,000 x for the last ten is already in the history books. I'd still be happy with that 100x, its like way more than stocks could ever do, but early it is not. I think high market cap alts will have trouble equaling and keeping the gains on similar moves, as most are not that much technically better than Bitcoin, and the name recognition is much less.

Taxes are nothing new, nor are 'tax vortexes' that wipe people out. In dot.bomb, SO MANY 'smart' people exercised their Cisco (or other tech company) stock options, and then tried to hold the stock for a year to get a lower tax rate, only to discover that the stock had fallen in value WAY below the tax owed on the options, and this created many tax bills vastly exceeding income or assets. 
Taxes just make most day trading options just not worth it, both from a complexity standpoint, and a total tax liability side. Maybe special tax rules will be made for crypto in the US, but it seems unlikely. At the end of the day, the safest thing is to use fiat to pay the taxes, and not depend on a risk asset to cover the charges that you know are coming.

You are a maximalist, I get that, but Bitcoin doesn't change. The last successful major update to Bitcoin was Segwit, and even that was hard fought at the time. Everything after that just failed, or became a fork. ANY scalability upgrade at this time will be second layer, and clunky as hell, like Lightning. Can alts scale on the base level ? Well, some of them can, at least in the 10 -100x level, and time will tell if they can do more, but the reality is, miners control Bitcoin, and those fees are staying, so RL day to day transactions must fall to another crypto, because Bitcoin couldn't handle even a single country actually adopting it for millions of people, even with Lightning, and I still hope this whole crypto thing is more than a get rich scheme...

Alts will survive, but the ones that succeed will NOT be the copycats. Bitcoin is revolutionary, but it also has many inherent flaws. anything that copies Bitcoin's core design will have some of these flaws. Proof of work will not work for a deep alt, its just too easy to 51 % attack anything that isn't at least 10 % of Bitcoins hash rate, and none of them are. 10 minutes is too long to wait, 2.5 minutes is too long. Only alts with fast transactions have a chance, when there are thousands competing. Transaction fees are annoying, and since many alts have little or no fees, anything with a Bitcoin like fee structure is going to have trouble being chosen, since why pay a fee when lots of alts have no fees ?

If Bitcoin stabilizes in value and slowly deflates, as some predict, and is just used as DigiGold, it might be less than that, as central banks hoard it all, like they do actual gold. Most of the use case for current holders is unreasonably large gainZ. If that goes away, I'd probably move on to an alt, and only the hard core Fed haters would remain, just like actual gold (actual gold also has jewelry and industrial use, but that is in many ways similar to how Bitcoin is used for exchange liquidity and base pairs )

You still need a bank to move fiat around, unless you like paying lots of CC conversion fees. Crypto has a long way to go to replace banks, and bitcoin will not be ideal for buying small items for a long time if ever. Great for holding money you are not using, but it doesn't fix the need to buy and sell from normal people in the real world.
Does your Ledger accept direct deposits from your employer ? I'm sure 1 or 2 employers will actually pay crypto to a cold wallet, but I have never dealt with one, and you still need fiat or a high fee crypto CC, for most retail transactions, and lets not forget billpay, since like 0 of my normal bill pay businesses accept crypto, and will probably be the last adopters of it.

I'll have to read it, and it will take some time, 'Bitcoin's true importance may just lie in providing a decentralized, neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks.'
This much is true, but the central banks may change money themselves, not because they want to, but because they have to, or be subject to some rather unpleasant market realities. Everything Bitcoin does could also be done by another crypto, one that is not mostly in the hands of a small tech elite (or lost forever, we don't know), one that does not require the energy of Iceland to confirm transactions, one that has better scaling. I could see the UN finally getting serious at some point and creating a true world currency, one that is fairly distributed to everyone on the planet, in proportion to current wealth, or maybe on a GNP basis. Such a distribution would be massively more fair than Bitcoin's rather random concentration in the hands of the tech-savvy and first movers. Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, I just don't believe all the normies and politicians will just fall in line, without trying their hands in the blockchain game.

Bitcoin is great, but how many people actually got in in 2009 and didn't lose their keys ? Very few, so most of its meteoric rise is spilled milk to the average redditor, also you could pick any of thousands of alts that are down 70 - 99 % over shorter periods, with no sign of coming back. I think its pretty clear WHY governments worry about crypto, and its not the loss of financial sovereignty, at least not for any of them but Libra. The truth is, governments are worried about people getting scammed out of all of their money, because they don't want to deal with upset constituents. Its pretty clear from congressional testimony about Libra that Bitcoin or alts don't worry governments at all, unless they fail or are scams.

It depends on the underlying demand for the token. Bitcoin could probably use some extra coins on top of its current inflation, because interest is so high, and apparently a lot of its possible 21 million coins were lost in the early days of crypto. For most alts, it is the opposite. Even 0 inflation coins like IOTA and nano are suffering price wise, and there doesn't seem to be enough demand to even soak up their initial issuance amounts, even YEARS later (!!)
