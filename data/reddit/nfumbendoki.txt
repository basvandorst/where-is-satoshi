We are lucky to have him on the team

But $20k total in today's BTC value or their value back then? Because if it's for current BTC value then anyone who bought more than two Bitcoin is having their info turned to the IRS

Hodl, boys. It's the name of the game! 
Great post, OP. Noobs take heed!

Is there a way to claim our bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:27:22
My experience with women says otherwise. For one thing, hodling in general is a masculine trait, roughly speaking (yes, I'm sure there are exceptions, but women more often than not don't believe in hodling, especially something volitile). If he tells her he wants to hodl most if that stash, more than likely she will be "fine" with it and passive-aggressively nag him into liquidation

I would highly advise you to hodl indefinitely. Even if Bitcoin failed and you lost twenty  thousand, you're still young so it's not the end of the world. However if Bitcoin continues to be adopted globally you might retire in your mid to late  twenties. HODL!!

Fwiw,  bull testicles are good eating. They kinda taste like bacon. In Montana there's a festival in a small town every year where the community drinks beer and eats balls for one day

He's not the first unsavory character who we've agreed with on some point or other. Charles Manson thought folk music was awesome. I agree with him on that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:06:24
ok ty
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:17:32
remains to be seen. He said he's still got two more years at home with his folks. So let's assume he's around 17 or 18 years old, maybe 16; in his late twenties it'll be ten years later. In ten years one coin could easily be in well in the six figures. Maybe not enough to retire, but definitely enough to be very confortable and to have the means to pursue a career he's actually passionate about instead of just grinding a living like the most of the population. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:36:45
Fair enough. I understand your points better now

Holy shit, I just realized Hodl is a recursive acronym! The H in hodl stands for hodl on for dear life, and the hodl in hodl on for dear life also stands for hodl on for dear life. And so shall we hodl, for ever!

it gets better, trust me. The first few episodes aren't super good, but the drama gets better later.

If it's so highly regulated then how come not one person got in trouble for fraud, and many actually got huge bail outs and gave themselves massive  bonuses? Don't bother answering, 'cause I have zero interest in engaging with you in discussion. You've always been a massive troll. At this point the community is well aware that you're an idiot and a mysoginist who enjoys riling people up for the hell of it. (Do you do that because of some self esteem issues you  picked up from being ostracized as a kid because you're ugly and gay?)

Why do you guys clump a bunch of words into a single word all the time!
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:40:25
ok, i see. seems like there could potentially get kinda chaotic 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:46:00
ty. 
so since segwit2x doesn't offer that protection, what kind of problems can we face if the fork does take place?
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:17:36
Good post. I'm gonna use that when people talk to me about alts. It's a good formula for deciding whether to diversify into an alt or not. Some alts do pass that test tho. For example, with monero, the usefulness is easy to understand: anon txs. Or with iota, the usefulness is fee-less txs. That's kinda of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:30:21
that's actually very interesting. Btw, I was just joshing you. I actually like that you guys do that. It's a convenient way to get the meaning of something across in a straight forward way :)

it there a way to claim my bitcoin gold so i can trade it for actual Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:38:52

@_date: 2017-10-01 00:19:19
Will btc held in trezor by affected by this?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:14:44
i have my btc in a trezor. is there a guide out there for claiming my btc gold? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:57:02
One is never the same again after the crypto epiphany. I'll never forget the moment i decided to buy some bitcoin. I just made the decision in my head, while sitting alone in a restaurant. Just making the decision made me feel so strange, like a euphoria. I never looked back
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:39:47
I'm confused. What does it mean to say one s2x is one fifth of a bitcoin in value? I thought the fork wasn't till November. . .
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:36:17
I think it might be more private to trade btc for xmr and trade back to btc, or just use xmr period if whoever you're transacting with accepts xmr as payment
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:54:15
I see.
I've seen people say that lack of replay protection could make claiming coins on the new chain more difficult than it was with the BCH fork. Is this true?
