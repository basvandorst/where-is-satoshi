However, he does have a point. I wish you would open a commerce site in my country. The lack of ways to spend bitcoin is one of my selling issues. When asked what can I do with it (as in my original topic question), I don't have a good answer at this price.

Face to face bitcoin transactions are the best way. Unless you are being paid with counterfeit money, its damn secure and you can always do normal criminal action if a transaction is bad.

While a negative look, I can't say I disagree with any of it. His point about the price stability and why Amazon can't use it, its quite logical and is a real problem for bitcoin as a currency, as opposed to a commodity. I do hope this develops beyond an "experiment" but I have to admit, I can't see it happening till it stabilizes and we can buy staples, like normal grocery food, with it. 
Unlike the author though, my outlook is more positive. Its new, it has a lot of growing to do. I think its great that its already gotten itself to a point where its regarded as legitimate enough to be a "threat" and regarded by a large community as a worthy commodity. A year ago when I mined my first bitcoin, I was not sure it would ever get to this point.

I posted this for Anderkent, [who seems to want to cling to some strange idea that only 1 account was compromised](     
I don't know anything exrta or that this legit, but read the thread. People there are confirming that their account and password is listed. I don't know how much more confirmation that that can be had on the internet. If the links posted goes down, I have the list. Got it when it was posted and can repost it so you can check if you are in there.

Possibly an intentional bitpocolypse (sp?)? I've been [critical of mt gox]( and this still holds. When problems started they should've frozen incoming and outgoing activity and hired some damn security experts instead of hoarding profits at their customer's expense.
That said, this looks a lot like a purposeful attack on bitcoin. Whether this turns out to be *yet again* another security failure on mt gox's part or a legit trade, the net effect is the same.    
This really hurts bitcoin. The volume is such that it can't be anything other than the point. Profit? Selling bitcoins at .01 (if I am reading things correctly) is not a profit motive.     
The question is who would want to destroy bitcoin? I have my ideas and many of those have more than enough money to pull this off without resorting to hacking. Just to throw something out there.
Edit: Whoops, looks like [profit could've been a motive]( Guess I am too paranoid! Nope, it seems Mt Gox's lousy security is to blame, yet again :(.

This ^. A service that facilitates buying and selling of goods. Something "easy"? How about a message board plugin (vbulletin, IPB, etc) so that message boards can get a marketplace based on bitcoins up and running quickly. Something that includes a way for the board admins to do escrow.   
Or maybe something for the popular CMS's so that people can get a webstore up and running fast. You can tie it into clearcoin or one of the escrow services for a shortcut.      
Anything really that promotes using bitcoins for buying and selling things that are not bitcoins ;). For this I think escrow is going to be really important. Until a bitcoin system with dispute resolution comes into the picture, escrow is key to a bitcoin for physical item transaction.

This is an interesting angle for me. On the one hand, its exactly one of the things I like about bitcoins. Not that you can buy drugs as that system wouldn't work for anyone here, for example. But it can be used to buy regulated things. Stupidly regulated would be more apt, like electronic cigarettes which is not allowed to sell nicotine oil here.
On the other hand, drugs carry a death penalty, and so is not something we talk about with people we don't know well. Also, mail is a big issue here, so I can't openly use it as a selling point.
@_date: 2011-06-18 12:41:10
Screw that, what's the harm here?    
If he is a whistleblower then we owe him gratitude, if he's a plant what's the harm? BTCguild looses miners due to FUD. In that case, its still a good thing, since BTCguild is getting too big a slice of the pie (catching up with deepbit). I'm switching over to Mtred (reddits mining team).    
I hope more redditors do the same.

Woot! This is awesome, hope to see this spread! What we need is more ways to do real world transactions. NFC might be a potential answer here.

I own non-military sub-contracting companies (eg call centers). Truth is, I profit off of the Western trend of off-shoring. A practice, might I add, that I helped lobby against as one of my unpaid intern duties when I was at school in the US. I wasn't an activist about it, the program offered the best credits per hours worked. I also lobbied for deregulation in various industries as well as many other things. So definitely not activism.
When I saw that punishing off shoring practices was obviously not going to win (Americans didn't seem to care), if anything it was made easier by being ignored by the American public, it was high on my list of a business to start. I ignored my parents' desire for me to get a PHD and I went home and started with a single call center which branched out into a lot of different industries.    
In regards to bitcoin, I fell in love with a beautiful activist, who's crazy life I couldn't keep up with but got converted to several causes. It has made my outlook so much different and bitcoins came out around the time she and I parted ways. It fell neatly into some of the ideas I was having myself. In a way, doing what I can for bitcoins locally is my first solo go at activism.

I am sorry to hear your name was on the list :(. I have never used Mt Gox, so I am safe. However this whole thing offends me. Mt Gox refusing to get the personnel or take measures to protect customers, is hurting bitcoin badly.
As the recent spate of hacks has shown, if one account on a massive list like this is broken, there are others. 
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:30:15
Thanks for your post. 


This^ is basically the part that I find unacceptable. I don't know how much mtgox is exploiting out of bitcoin, but reports say its a lot. In any event, its certainly enough to at least pretend to secure their damn site.   
They do not do insurance, so what is lost is a loss of the customer, not mtgox, unless they feel like refunding it. So what's the overhead? Bandwidth, servers and personnel?   
I don't feel like doing it, but you can go through this subreddit and list out about a dozen reported problems. From the dude who had USD1000 transferred into his account by mistake (meaning some other guy lost USD1000) to all the reports of account hacking. Its much worse in the bitcoin forums.     
If this is the main exchange for bitcoin, this sucks for all of us! On the first incidence of problems mtgox should've locked accounts, only allowing trading with what is in the account and hired some help, since clearly their current staff is not able to deal with problems.    
I am not even a mtgox customer and this whole thing pisses me off just as a big supporter of bitcoins. Mtgox customers should be far more angry.

AFAIK, the only way to use paypal for bitcoin is via second life dollars,  or youtipit. Besides  there are a ton of restrictions on using paypal (45 day locks, limited money per time, etc).

If people could do mainstream stuff with bitcoins, like buy food, bitcoins would be guaranteed a future. As it is, its been a speculator's toy and that worries me. As a commodity, its competing with gold, oil, rice, etc.
After my post the other day, I was contacted by someone who wanted to buy bitcoins. We met this morning and he/she/it told me they were getting bitcoins to buy a good. That was my first customer who actually wanted to buy something instead of just buying into the novelty.
That gave me hope.

I agree that supply and demand is the key. However, you assume that demand would decrease. This is a potentially false assumption. Pirated music is "illegal" but demand for it has only increased since market introduction. Granted, there is technology involved but the point still holds. Making something illegal does not necessarily equate to demand decline, which is the premise of your statement.    
     
I am not saying it wouldn't. Personally I have no idea. I know that making it illegal would not kill it. It would still be used like egold. For porn, HYIP scams, money laundering and buying and selling illicit goods. Its too late to kill it, it has already established itself as legitimate. There will always be ways to use services like Webmoney or Liberty reserve to convert it into cash. 
That doesn't answer the OP's question but there is no right answer. No one can know what will happen. I certainly hope that scenario doesn't occur as I am not into bitcoin for illicit purposes.
@_date: 2011-06-17 08:36:47
I wonder if this is the reason prices are falling today? A bit of paranoid selling to get rid of "insecure" coins for cash in the bank? I have to admit, I considered it after the USD500k story hit but then I tramped down my fear reflex.

You think its bad for you, try doing this from a country that is outside of the northwest's banking infrastructure. Took me more than a month to get bitcoins and I barely avoided getting scammed twice.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:25:08
Er...no. Browse around the bitcoin forums or just browse back through this subreddit. Many more than 1 account on Mt Gox has been compromised.    
Or just go to the parent of the first thread I linked. A white hat had been trying to contact mt gox for a week about a big hole in their security, before they got around to addressing it.   
Bottom line. Mt Gox security is a big problem.
@_date: 2011-06-18 05:45:06
What I find unacceptable, if posts on that thread can be believed, is that the user trying to report the vulnerability was ignored by mtgox for a freaking [week]( Those guys at mtgox need to get their head out of their ass, assuming that is all true, and figure out how to go through incoming customer feedback faster.
I'm glad I don't use mtgox. I bought a ton of bitcoins on IRC back when people bought [2 pizzas for B10k]( and I have been selling to individuals, face to face, ever since.     
The thing that bothers me the most is that this stuff is really hurting bitcoin. :(
Edit: And this seems to be [a problem on multiple sites](
@_date: 2011-06-18 14:43:31
Lol, no but that would be awesome!
@_date: 2011-06-08 14:17:42
So is exploitative investment the only angle to play on selling bitcoins today? Not that this is a terrible thing, but I would hate to sell on this and then have people angry when the bubble bursts. I really want bitcoin to succeed but buying in at this price is a bit like buying in on a stock at a high price. Sure, during a bubble it can still go up more and split and so forth, but then it crashes. At that point everyone I sell bitcoins to will never use them again. My goal is to help this develop this into a viable currency in my country and get it off of the Western banking system that is slowly corrupting our economy. I've been selling at 10% below Gox to try and encourage its use but, as I mentioned, I am extremely low volume. I bought bitcoins many months ago, then again a few months ago, but that is all I have.
Edit: To those asking if I will sell to you, list what country you are in. If you are in my country, yes I will be happy to sell to you and I will contact you to arrange a meet. Otherwise, I'm sorry but I am a local exchanger only. I am not exchanging for profit (though I admit I will be making profit given the price I bought and what it is now), I do not need the money. I am only interested in promoting its use here, hopefully if enough of us have bitcoins to spend, some of our vendors might start accepting them.
@_date: 2011-06-22 10:17:31
You know what bothers me about this is that its theater. Its a distraction for the fanboys and astroturfers.    
We should be concentrating on 2 things in regards to this whole incident. How to make sure there is accountability in the return of the money/coins in mtgox. Otherwise Mtgox customers have a good case for criminal fraud IMO.    
Then how to make sure this guy never screws bitcoin again. Besides the fanboys and astroturfers, I don't expect anyone will be using mtgox again. However, nothing will stop him from changing his name and creating a new site to screw people again. Its not that I am positive any of this is intentional, but its clear he is incompetent and that he also has incredible marketing skills. A very dangerous combination for nascent bitcoin.    
In a bigger picture, the question is how to keep bitcoin alive after this. I've spent the last few days having to meet customers wanting to return bitcoins. In the hope they will eventually come back to bitcoin when things settle down, I am doing it. Its been a very bad situation for my goal to spread its use in my country and I am not sure it will recover.
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:38:52

@_date: 2011-06-17 08:30:44
This looks like fud (I have no clue though), however all the recent bitcoin security issues is not good for us damnit.  
I know after the USD500k story hit, I got paranoid. Now have my "coins" locked in a security facility (as per the advice I got in a prior Reddit thread) and have exactly B0.50 in my wallet. 
I've been with bitcoin for about a year and this crap got me nervous. Granted I am more paranoid than the next guy, but I don't want to imagine what plebs who might have otherwise been interested in buying in might be thinking.    
Worse, if I was a successful retailer, this crap would make me stay the hell away from bitcoins. The exact opposite of what we need :(.     
Off topic but potentially funny. Last night, I actually met a customer in my car in the facility's parking lot. Its the easiest way to take out the laptop from the vault and then to get it back in, as non-customers are not allowed in the facility itself. The parking facility has like a dozen armed guards patrolling around it. My driver was standing outside my car smoking a cigarette and, to complete the ridiculous scene, I have a suv with mirrored tinting on the windows. My customer and I were laughing at how ridiculous it all was.        
As a contrast, I usually just meet a customer in my office or in a cafe or someplace normal. Last night was like a scene from a incredibly bad movie with d-list actors. I think I need to relax the paranoia and move a few thousand bitcoins to several different wallets so that I can go back to the old way of selling bitcoins. My customer last night was cool, but some may freak at the whole thing.
@_date: 2011-06-08 13:46:41

@_date: 2011-06-14 18:47:08
You raise a good point. After reading your reply, I think there is a practical effect that will force demand to decrease if the US criminalizes bitcoin. Right now most of the methods to get bitcoins, on the consumer level, require utilizing a North American or European service. Outside of Liberty Reserve and wire transfers, the rest of the traffic would be halted by US action (for example Dwollar). Wire transfers as well could become problematic, similar to how terrorist banking is controlled.

That is true of general security, but when 1 white hat is begging you to listen to him for a week and you ignore him, well then you screwed up *and* you just screwed your customers.  
The worst part is, with bitcoins being newly mainstream and you are the central exchnage for the currency/commodity, you also screw the bitcoin movement. Hard.
@_date: 2011-06-28 10:58:02
Agreed, but I don't believe there will be a massive influx of new buyers anymore (or rather massive influx of volume), thanks to mt gox incompetence. The impact of speculation is very important in this analysis, I beleive.    
Price skyrockets on large buys. People who do massive buys are not buying bitcoins to spend on a new ecigarette. They are buying to make money on speculation. Massive incompetence by mt gox has done a good job of killing that.    
Forget the hack. If you are a speculator and had say USD200k in brent crude futures. Then the market closed and held your USD200k for a week and kept saying you could get access to it at a day and time and kept changing that date and time. You are desperate to get that cash because spot gold took a big dip and your research said that it would regain its loss fast afterwards, but you don't have that USD 200k to buy in. You just lost a ton of money. Would you ever speculate on such an incompetent system again? No you wouldn't and neither will anyone who was formerly speculating on bitcoin.
Outside of speculators (which I assume is the reason bitcoin was pushed to USD30 based on trade volume during that time), demand is currently stable. This is the perfect situation. No speculators means no crazy price fluctuations and steady demand means bitcoin will survive. 
So bottom line for me is I am very happy mt gox is an incompetent fool. That idiot actually helped bitcoin become stable and position itself as a viable merchant currency!
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:36:10
You know, as a bitcoin idealist who was swept up with the idea a year ago of decentralized currency, your comment should make me cringe. However, you have a point.    
I guess the problem is that current monetary regulation is piss poor. Going the opposite direction though, well it does seem to have its downsides. :( Guess we still have work to do, but that's the point isn't it. At this stage its so new there are problems to deal with and whether we can fix them will determine if this can work or not.      
I'll tell you one thing. The first problem that needs rectifying is people need to stop using Mt Gox till they get their house in order and demonstrably hire some top level security people. The question though, is will Tradehill be any better once they start getting the volume Mt Gox does? Will anyone? How many of these crappy amateur hour markets do we need to go through till we get it right? Too many and I'd be afraid for bitcoin's survivability.
@_date: 2011-06-15 13:59:30
Just curious, did you use the same password on all the services that were compromised? Additionally, was your password the recommended 12+ characters, letters, numbers and punctuation?     
I guess what I am wondering is whether the fault was a weak password/password policy or a weakness in the site's security.     
     
Edit: Definitely a good time to check out some of the great advice I got in the [bitcoin safe thread]( I posted the other day.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:56:29
Thanks! After reading all the comments on Mt Gox, it still doesn't make sense. The hacker would have to know that USD1k was all they could get. This whole thing is crazy overkill for USD1k. There were a lot of easier ways to do it.
For example just going through the list of [released usernames and passwords]( and stealing whatever was in the account.
@_date: 2011-07-05 12:12:53

Probably the most popular here is called [gcash]( its been around for a while. There are others and independent ones, but gcash is accepted in the most places (like the grocery). I pay bills with it, buy movie tickets, buy food, order delivery, etc. In terms of mobile, we've been ahead of the global median in the commercial sector (wimax rolled out in like 08/09 and around 96% nationwide UMTS (aka 3G) coverage). I was in the deep province on a mountain last year, lost as hell, and was able to google map my way out with full 3G signal bars and have a skype to skype conversation with a relative who was giving us directions based on the gmaps data.
Our government, however, is in the stone age. Can't imagine our bureau of tax to be progressive enough to allow taxes to be handled by phone. We're lucky we don't have to take a number and wait 8 hours in a non-air conned room to talk to an agent anymore. Those corrupt bums need to be taken out French revolution style.
