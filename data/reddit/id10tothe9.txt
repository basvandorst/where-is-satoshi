thanks for the link, but it's about access to google only (which i already recovered) not recovering other keys of other sites right?
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:55:52
Haha, yah definitely something about Lawsky even if u don't feel comfortable with it but it will get their attention! Lawsky hates freedom definitely good, or eg Lawsky Vs. Wind of change and a btc symbol then ur QR.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:55:26
thanks I'll see if I can do something with that :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:00:23
it didn't work. had it up on my android now for almost a month, my address never got listed on the site.

ehehe, yah and at some point to Neptune, it's our destiny :D
but seriously, showing what public funding where people choose what to fund instead of the government using taxes to do that, it's a paradigm shift and a change of the current model. Maybe right now the donations won't be worth much, but with time this will increase and if NASA is able at some point to help it's short funded projects with the bitcoins it gets from people it'll be the first step towards a model where people decide what should be done with the tax money because they have the control.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:00:57
exactly! Is there somebody trusted, or maybe can implement a trusted procedure to create a donation address that will be spent only as by NASA? Maybe create a site that presents the projects of NASA, with an address for each project and people can donate to the projects they like.

thanks man
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:30:15
thanks man I hope other people learn from this, but I also hope somebody here can help me recover the file. there must be some software to recover deleted data if they weren't overwritten!
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:10:04
yah that's what I will do. I thought avast did that now I learned the hard way.
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:28:14
you mean on the phone to restore the data? that's what I did and I got all the apps back, but not the authenticator keys it was like using it for the first time.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:58:20
I think there is no need right now to create another coin for that purpose, it's just a matter of people donating whatever coins they value. but to make it simple let's just make it bitcoin for a start. It's about showing what this new kind of economy could do and kick it started!
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:11:10
still anyway, what I'm looking for is software that can restore deleted files from the phone, there must be something out there?!
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:27:10
thanks I wish it was only bitstamp, but it's more like 10 different exchanges that I don't remember the names of :'(
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:42:25
wow didn't know that, good to know for the future!
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:03:27
can somebody tell me what the new regulation said? didn't really follow the news since I kinda don't care what they do I know BTC will prevail! but sometimes I do get curious about what those politicians are doing hehe..
@_date: 2013-07-25 18:49:27
ok sorry, correction. the electricity bill can vary by a factor of 2 between Europe and US, the the efficiency must be modified by the factor. i guess Ukraine will be the best place for mining then.. :/
@_date: 2013-07-28 08:01:57
thanks! bitstamp looks awesome!
I'll check them nice options out :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:18:28
that's awesome mate thanks!! I'll try it out now!
after that I'm gonna find out how to tip on reddit cuz this code which was made with love in Chile is soo great :D
@_date: 2013-07-27 12:36:41
yeah I totally agree. but I think with your saturn purchase you'll still be fine, because they are really twice as efficient in terms of hash/joule that if any body will profit then it will be knc. I think there was also AMC or something they are more efficient but not so many on the market I suppose so at least you'll be able to get your ROI. I will try to buy shares in mining assemblies of KNCMiners, it seems the better option since electricity here in europe is twice as high as elsewhere -_-..
on the other hand litecoin seems as a promising alternative to me, and probably feathercoin since they are trying to get businesses to deal with it!
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:23:04
this is awesome dude! Now I'm modifying it to get other things I want to do. never programmed stuff like this before :D
but I'm trying to get my trade history and I need to pass on the "marketid" parameter, been working on that the entire day without success. how would you do that?
I tried passing it on as an "object" (not sure what that means) in the 
cryptsyRequest function in this line:
  var params = "nonce=" + nonce + "&amp;method=" + method + "&amp;inputs=" + {marketid : 26};
but I'm getting no where with that..
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:20:40
thanks for the advice! it's crazy though, if this really happens how is any miner going to make a return? I mean with such a rate every mining machine would be making loss after 5 months or so and no new machine will be able to pay itself back!
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:47:59
ok thanks again mate, I can now get all my data and do all kinds of stuff with them which is awesome! I took the easy way instead of reddit tip and just sent some coins your way ;). Cheers!

so I don't really get it. suppose I have 1 btc on btc-e and I want to sell it on mtgox or bitstamp, if I place a sell order via trucoinrt who is going to send my 1 btc from btc-e to mtgox if the order gets accepted? and when I got dollars on mtgox and wanna buy on btc-e I need to transfer the dollars there first myself? what is the point then?
@_date: 2013-09-02 13:44:04
where did you get that info from? I don't think it's true.
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:49:37
another important aspect that just now became clear to me is the hash rate / Joule. well, it is the only important aspect (electricity bill can be neglected at the current btc price). the machines with the highest efficiency will be the most profitable, and since the difficulty adjusts to the hash rate, those with low efficiency machines will have to drop out first. This means per definition, if you got the most efficient machine then you WILL make profit :D.
in that case I guess bitfury is the winner, but don't know if they are trustworthy or will deliver on time. after that comes knc. wow, I believe it's really that simple :D
