No, normal banks do too. Money, under the current system is effectively just an IOU.(either paper money or digits "in a bank") 
"In other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. "

Moving $100 million, for me, under *any* circumstances would be nerve-racking.
Personally, if I was reasonably certain that I hadn't offended a state actor in some way, getting my BTC "outta Dodge" to cold storage in the manner he did was a calculated risk. One that would likely succeed and did. End to end encrypted traffic over Tor? Yeah I think so.

I would not say it costs "almost nothing". It costs plenty of energy and $$ to mine and refine an ounce of Gold.
"The average grade of the top 50 by size and grade is 5.3 gm/ton. To put this in perspective you have to move 9.3 tons of earth to get the weight of 1 golf ball worth of gold." Not to mention all the other costs involved like refining etc. [What is the Cost of Mining Gold]( Edit: 2013 data

The "connecting your hardware wallet" part needs some elaboration. At the moment your hardware wallet does not *directly* connect to your bitcoin core node. Work in progress.
To mitigate and preserve privacy, I use Electrum on the desktop to connect to HW wallet. Which in turn is configured to connect to a local instance of Electrum Personal Server which scans your local bitcoin core node for your address/wallet history. I believe Chris Belcher, the Electrum Personal Server author, is testing TOR broadcasts of new transactions at the moment. (actually EPS *users* can test this now!) Soon, end-to-end TOR transactions and history checking connecting to HW wallets - with no privacy leaks. Edit: of course it would be nice if the core node did all this, but there are many other competing priorities.

Was merely pointing out that Gold is not that easy or inexpensive to produce. That is, wasn't attempting to conclude anything about bitcoin's energy expenditure/value via comparisons to Gold.
Also not saying that BTC's value is mostly due to the energy expended mining it. There are other factors at work. Scarcity, stock/flow, immutability, censorship resistance, consensus rules, governance, to name a few. 
Bitcoin is relatively small and volatile. I believe it will become less so over time. Definitely tiny compared to Gold at this point in time.

Electrum, 3+, supports *both* bech32 "native" segwit AND segwit-in-p2sh/P2SH-P2WPKH (start with "3" addresses).
Edit: granted it is more painful in Electrum because, as the post says, not many other wallets support native segwit format yet. Trezor for example uses "old style" non-native segwit addresses.

Bars in general are easier to counterfeit than coins. Not to say there are not counterfeit coins, but they are easier to detect. Bars lack the fine grain details, rigorous weight and size limits that coins have. 
For example, a 1 troy oz coin must weigh *very near* to 31.1 gm. If it isn't within a few hundredths of a gram, then that is very suspicious. Much harder to make *undetectable*, by simple means, counterfeit coins.
Also bars in general cost more. So more bang for your counterfeit buck if you manage to fool someone.

Do some research. BCH is not scalable, at least not to VISA transaction levels. Without layer 2+ BCH will have the same scalability problems. Things like increasing centralisation, which diminishes trust/sovereignty over your money, and network latency. Increasing the base layer block size is not a solution to scalability.

Commerce without security and decentralisation is no better than fiat. Patience ffs. Adopt segwit. Adopt layer 2+ solutions.

Sooner or later they *all* have this issue. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and the first to have scalability issues. Also the first to look, logically and correctly, at layer 2+ solutions.

De facto no matter what any politicians or tax authorities may *say*, bitcoin is a currency. Do you get taxed buying your coffee in the morning with cash? Uh... no. The drink is taxed, a sales tax likely, but not you for simply using the currency. (i.e. incurring "capital gains" for using the currency)
To tax a currency for use is ludicrous. Good luck trying to collect. This is akin to taxing barter, which most people ignore.

Privacy question; how is the trade(r) history stored on the "exchange server"? Who has access to this data? Is it encrypted? What are the user registration terms? 
Edit: love the concept, but fear that this could become an easy target for governments and regulators to steal your privacy. Devil is in the details. Are "your user id, sell offers, trade history, and reputation are stored" anonymous? That is, how much identifiable info do I as a "user" need to surrender to you to use the system? If just an ID and anonymous then it rocks - otherwise will think twice.

There's that word again: "rehypothecation". In other words, scam. The MF Global heist opened my eyes to rehypothecation. How can a real asset be "owned" multiple times? You either own it or you don't. WTF??
Unfortunately the rehypothecation at the heart of our entire modern financial system is nothing more than a house of cards. Built on "I owe you nothings". Debt. Promises to pay. Utter bullshit.
As we got further away from the notion of true asset money - i.e. PMs and Gold this rehypothecation fraud has taken over and run amok. And the scams continue. Bitcoin, as a digital incarnation of Gold money, offers some hope.

You don't understand - it isn't money!?! It's DEBT. Bank deposits are DEBT. Central bank issued fiat currency is DEBT. There's a big difference. Counter party risk. Gold you possess is money. You own it - no counter party. If your financial institution goes bust, get in line behind the rest of the creditors.
Anyone having significant capital inside the financial system at this point in time, especially with the repression underway (read: interest rates held at 0%) - seriously needs to give their heads a shake. Get it out while you still have the chance!! Buy gold, silver, land, bitcoin - anything of value that is difficult to seize. But get it out of the banks or you will lose it either to serious inflation, bail-ins or capital controls.

Bullshit. Gold is money and has been money for a long, long time. It is untrue to say that it transitioned to a store of wealth only after "thousands of years" of currency usage. Simply not true. Gold has been a store of wealth ever since it was recognized as money, and even before its first use as a currency. One of the attributes of money is that it is a store of wealth. Gold has not always been used as an "official" currency however, as in the current fiat system.

What the regulators would be saying if they were transparent &amp; honest is: "we're really here to protect monopoly powers and preserve regulatory capture for our own selfish interests - it's for your own good don't forget".

Patience is hard. And to paraphrase Jesse Livermore: "Sit tight and be right".
Concerning bitcoin, whenever I have doubts, I ask myself if the value proposition has changed at all. Namely; Does it still have great utility in ways no other "money" has? The code been hacked? Network effect no longer valid? Crypto broken? Is it still revolutionary programmable money? 
If I get the right answers I continue to hold - regardless of the price. And if the price gets "really cheap" I buy more. Sit tight &amp; be right. 
Disclaimer: bitcoin is not my only speculation/investment - don't put more in than u can afford to lose!! If I lost it all tomorrow, I'd be sad but it wouldn't wipe me out.
Edit: everyone's situation is different. Livermore also said much more. I suppose if you're not a trader and believe the fundamentals will out over the long term then his quote applies. If you're strictly a trader then it's all "funny-mentals" and u don't care.

Also if I pay my coffee in the US with an officially recognized foreign currency there are no "tax consequences". Just currency conversion fees - if the vendor will even accept the Euros for example. Ya lost me on that part. :-)
Edit: and if the coins have been properly mixed or addons like Dark Wallet become the norm, even if the IRS wanted to tax me on that 0.0003 BTC above how are they able to associate my identity to the BTC? BTW thanks for starting this thread.

The "wealth" you refer to is fictional. Debt-based. Rather it is more aptly termed "credit".

Yes. While you're at it, ask the people of Germany where their government's gold is. Nothing that happened on MtGox is unique to bitcoin! This kind of obfuscation and theft shit is nothing new and goes on and on and on despite "regulation". Government is just a word representing people who know how to manipulate the system. 
Simply put: Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Human nature. Trust NO ONE with too much power or money! This is THE reason why decentralized systems of trust are necessary.

Own GLD and converting to physical? Uh, no. Good luck with that. GLD is a paper scam, read the prospectus *closely*. On the day you really need the physical it will not be available. Unless you are a bullion bank you will not be able to convert. Gold is SHTF insurance - everyone should have even a small amount. Just buy the physical and hold it yourself and be done with it.

To me whether I can buy a car directly with gold or not does not mean gold is not "money".  At least - in the traditional sense. You obviously define it differently. However perhaps we can both agree that gold is "wealth". A store of value that was once commonly used as a means of exchange like fiat currency today.(although in FX terms, and for Central Banks of the world, gold was and still is, uber currency) 
With all the shenanigans happening in the world of currencies at the moment I would not at all be surprised that there may come a point in time where the various un-backed fiat "currencies" issued by governments are no longer commonly accepted as "money" by the people. Traditional money, "Commodity money", gold and silver have a much longer record as money &amp; currency than fiats used within the current fiat based digital/paper economic system.(post Nixon) I might also add that gold is kryptonite to the Central Bankers and politicians of the world who like to spend what they don't have, and supply largesse to their cronies in order  to maintain power.

In my opinion, he is also totally correct in the idea that expecting the current centralized governance system to reform is bogus.  It'll reform when it collapses and that process is well underway.

Fantasy? How about Gold - it's a fantasy deflationary currency? A mere commodity? Bitcoin was deliberately modeled after Gold. Yes Gold trades but a very large amount just sits quietly most of the time in vaults and has value. Great value. 3 billion people in Asia hold it. Even some lucid westerners hold it. Central banks hold it. And no not paper Gold - what the West considers "Gold" (ex. GLD or Comex futures contracts) isn't even Gold!? Paper promises nothing more. Real Gold is bought and held.
Gold is hardly irrelevant even though the paper money masters would have us believe that. Your "highly sophisticated currency system" is built on belief. And right now that belief is looking increasingly shaky.

Consumable? To say that gold is consumable is laughable. First off Gold is Money. Period.
Most of the gold ever mined is held as wealth in the form of jewellery adorning Indian housewives. Tens of thousands of tonnes - more than all the Central Banks gold combined. And the amount of gold consumed in industrial uses is miniscule by comparison. Gold, and especially in the form of jewellery, is money pure and simple. Asians know this instinctively, but the west seem to have mostly forgotten this fact.

Gold jewellery is not as fungible as bullion, but still fungible. Go to Thailand and see what I mean. There gold jewellery is measured by weight and is 96.5% pure. "Baht" is a unit of weight - a unit of account for commodity money.(1 baht slightly less than .5 troy oz. - 15.2gm)  No coincidence baht is also the name of their fiat currency. 
Also, in the east you can buy and sell gold no questions asked - everywhere.(many dedicated gold shops even in small towns) In the west said necklace can easily be exchanged for fiat currency at pawn shops or coin shops.
Gold is not a fiat exchange unit, or an "official" fiat currency - true. Legal tender laws and all. However I would argue that true "money" cannot be legislated into or out of existence. It is what the people accept. And in most parts of the world that is and traditionally has been GOLD. For a long long time. Never mind the niceties of what any  government says is legal tender. I never said gold functioned the same as fiat currency, only that it is widely recognized as money. True real money with lasting value. A fungible store of wealth and most definitely a unit of account.

Hmmm... yes but I believe there definitely is something of a safe haven effect which bitcoin and gold share. 
The difference being, when I look at Gold, TPTB have a much greater ability, via derivatives, to control its price. With cryptos, we're not there - yet. In other words, in a more "free" market, based on the physical, Gold would be more volatile and definitely be higher at this point in time. Gold traditionally is the go-to safe haven asset. A canary in the coal mine announcing problems in the financial system.(which is why TPTB like to keep it "quiet")
Bitcoin is taking on the characteristics of an "improved", at least as far as portability for sure, gold. Gold 2.0. Physical gold, version 1.0, still has value though as a quiet &amp; deep "cold-storage" option for wealth.

You are right about the sheep wanting to pay capital gains on their bitcoins. But what keeps governments afloat, apart from coercion, are several other important things. Confidence, trust and the moral authority to govern. To say these are slipping badly recently is an understatement. 
BTC at $4k+ kinda blows the doors off the "there is no inflation" argument. Hmmm... perhaps the almighty buck isn't really. And once confidence in the government issued fiat is lost it's game over. And that goes for the much ballyhooed SDR too. Same wolf different clothing.
Why do you think governments, and their bullion bank proxies, keep such a death grip around the throats of the precious metals? Or look at Gaddafi?(Gold dinar) Or Saddam?(Oil for Euros) All are threats to confidence in the Petro$ reserve currency. 
Also agree that the main conflict is a war of ideas. Centralisation and mostly corrupt hierarchies, which have ruled the roost for uncountable millennia now, versus decentralisation and more freedom/power at an individual level. But individuals must step up and withdraw their consent first! Social change. It's way overdue.

As far as all money is evil, I would defer to the bible on that. It is not money that is evil - money is necessary for modern societies to function. Rather it is the *love* of money that is evil.

Re: wag the dog. Correct and with all the possibilities of corruption that entails. Example the paper precious metals futures markets, particularly Silver. The CFTC &amp; CME look the other way, possibly colluding with, bullion banks who do not have to back their shorts with the actual commodity. That is, bullion banks can essentially print un-backed paper shorts. As many as they need.
Voila. Price rigging scheme in perpetuity. Bitcoin futures may be an improvement though given proof of ownership. The banks are notorious for obfuscating/hiding gaming bullion bar lists and not allowing proper audits of their holdings. Futures have a legit purpose no doubts but have lent themselves to being gamed by large corrupt/corrupting influences. As indeed have most markets.

Not sure what you mean by "no money is touching the asset". The futures most certainly affect the *price* of the buying and selling of physical metals!
As to why this has gone on for so long the answer is simple: the PMs, especially Gold are *political*. In other words, competition to the almighty Petro$. Would you want to give up the power to print endless amounts of "money" with keystrokes? I would say as long as there is confidence in the currency, yes, the games go on... in perpetuity or at least until confidence is lost.
Look at the state of ""markets"" these days. Not just metals. Stock prices levitating to the sky. Why? Free money from the central banksters. Artificially suppressed interest rates. Printing of money to the tune of trillions. Why is the Fed so opposed to an audit? Because they know an audit would expose all sorts of underhanded skulduggery to prop up the current corrupt cesspool of a system. Of that I have no doubts. Bailing out foreign banks for example. Why?
The capability to conjure up "money" from thin air, which is how the current bankster system actually works, is a powerful drug. 
Manipulation, intimidation, the utter gullibility of a slowly awakening population, and several thousand military bases around the planet are the only things keeping the current system going. Not. For. Much. Longer.

Our economic system is corrupt. Those closest to the monetary spigot (Wall Street) are unfairly advantaged. Our political system is lock and stock owned by $$ interests. Representation of the people is a sick joke. Inevitably moral &amp; societal corruption results. Just look at the state of society in the US!? Civil war would not be a stretch at some point.

Yeah like, back in the day when governments actually had to pay for marvelous things like wars with money that was difficult to produce. Think Gold. 
Taxing people in scarce hard money was naturally very unpopular in those days. VS now all a government need do is: CTRL-P. 
1913 marked the beginning of the end for society. Easy money, easy everything. No rules. Corruption on a galactic scale. Free shit armies and endless wars. That's what fiat has wrought. Unelected bankers rule the world - for now. But they're well on the way to inevitably self-destructing with negative interest rates. It won't work in the real world.

~~If~~ When BTC reaches $60k, fiat price of bitcoin *won't matter*. Trying to price bitcoin in terms of fiat will be pointless. 
It is becoming increasingly apparent, to even the most dense among us, that bitcoin *is* the economic singularity. In fact, I believe we're already there. Fiat price of bitcoin is meaningless when nobody desires to hold fiat. Yes, even the venerable USD.

Except that inflation stats are manipulated. Inflation in the things we don't need, like flat screen TVs, isn't there. And inflation in the things that are required - like a dwelling, decent education, medical insurance and taxes, continue to rise. How will incomes continue to keep pace? (answer: they aren't already &amp; they won't)
We are in uncharted territory. Remember saving? What a quaint, now apparently archaic, notion. Savers are royally screwed. NIRP is a wealth tax. As is QE and "Modern Monetary Theory". It's all just printing "money".(debt) The speculators bet on capital gains and we are *all* speculators now. Like it or not.
My humble opinion on all this? Pure unadulterated insanity. We. Are. Fucked.

Consider taking either across borders. Taking any significant $$ value of gold across a border raises eyebrows and risks confiscation.("censorship") Even if done with proper declarations "by the book". You're always at the risk of a possibly capricious/corrupt 3rd party.

Inflation measures are purposely understated by governments. The things we don't need, like flat screen TVs keep getting cheaper. While the things we absolutely need like a roof over our heads and quality health care and education are skyrocketing in cost. Inflation measures are deliberately skewed towards the former not the latter.
We are like frogs boiling in water.

Not talking about usage - "easy" referring was to the ability to create or produce various "monies". Also, given time, bitcoin will become easier for the average person to use. 
Can you print Gold? Can you print bitcoin? No. They're hard money. You may however print fiat - by design it's easy money to print. This is not obvious from the name "fiat"?? Do you know what fiat means?
Do we not have free shit armies in countries like the US - but seriously anywhere governments can print to hand out goodies to the populace? We do. Think EBT and food stamps. Think UBI. Think AOC and "Modern Monetary Theory" == print money. Why do we have free shit armies?? Because of easy money and the *high time preference* for money that loses value exponentially. Easy way to control the populace. Fiat money. 
I agree completely with Saifedean Ammous - high time preference spend it or lose it is no net positive for culture or society. It's a complete and utter disaster. Socially, economically, culturally, politically and morally.

I get what you're saying and agree that relatively few people hold substantial amounts. Also that we are still in a state where fiat equivalents still matter - the world has not wholesale abandoned fiat. Yet.
The psychology behind the singularity has already arrived though. And *this* involves considering bitcoin in a broader global context;
 
 - BTC already many times the value of gold per coin
 - bitcoin is nowhere near as "tamable" as the precious metals 
 - Banks and Central Banks, are (rightly) very worried as bitcoin directly challenges their power. The power to print money.
 - bitcoin is by design difficult to take down
 - most importantly the world is slowly recognizing, even still mostly unconsciously, that the fiat system is a *dead man walking*
 - the power to print "money" is not what it once was - we have reached global debt saturation.
   
Central bankers, and in particular the Fed are out of bullets. They're now talking NIRP and using further QE as a conventional tool!? This policy will not work and the unintended consequences will be too great.

Lightning is a layer that sits above the Bitcoin base layer. (hint: think of the TCP/IP or the OSI models for the Internet) So yes, it runs on, or is based upon, the Bitcoin blockchain, albeit not directly. Edit: perhaps it is more correct to say simply that Lightning is *based upon* the Bitcoin blockchain/protocol.
There is no Lightning token. It's *all bitcoin* - only layered in a truly P2P, arguably more anonymous, and certainly faster and cheaper way.

The thing with fiat and paper money is the potentially unlimited supply. A.k.a. "fractional reserve". Physical gold more closely resembles bitcoin in this respect. You either hold it/possess the keys, or you don't. That is they're not derivatives. Fiat/paper are. Gold and bitcoin futures are.

China is the second largest economy in the world. They have just devalued their currency peg against the USD. Two percent in one day - with more to follow likely. So Chinese exports are cheaper in USD terms. This makes it difficult for other exporters to compete. Chinese competitors must cheapen their currencies or lower their prices in USD terms to compete. Lower prices worldwide for manufactured goods sounds like exporting deflation to me.

Bitcoin uncertainty. Yes, I would say that fits. Uncertainty is up so price is down. Yet Bitcoin has a remarkable way of working through troubling issues. To say Bitcoin is complex is an understatement. Antifragile? So far so good... we'll see.
Gold is a bargain. Gold's "price" is currently determined by the futures. Which is primarily a paper market.(at around 120 "owners" per physical ounce of Gold traded on the COMEX) At some point physical settling (only) futures markets will dominate. And in a worldwide currency war who will be "the last man standing"? It will be Gold.
I would say Gold's enduring history is more accurate.

Why is running your own node important? Individual. Financial. Sovereignty. 
Not only is "not your keys not your bitcoin" true, but also "not your code not your bitcoin". If you were around in 2017 you experienced first-hand the effect of users running their own nodes.

Consider bitcoin as digital Gold.

Centralised, concentrated ownership in just about *anything* of value, inevitably leads to corruption. 
Edit - yes there exist distributed consensus rules also.  Nuance; which makes bitcoin resistant to rule changes but in general more widely held bitcoin is preferable. Not your keys - not your bitcoin.

Good question. 
Also consider wealth that has minimal **counter-party risk**. On that particular metric, in my opinion, physical precious metals held in hand are somewhat less vulnerable than cryptos. The latter require some kind of network to be useful. Both cryptos &amp; PMs are way less vulnerable than the overwhelming majority of financial "assets" that have *severe* counter-party risk. There is a reason that multiple quadrillion$ of $s in derivatives exist! Default risk - insurance!

The banksters, and their ho politicians, are waking up to the fact there exist systems based on math that obviate the need for them. We don't need them and we sure as hell don't trust them. Nor fiat currencies. 
If I was a big ol' bankster like Dimon I'd be attacking too. If cryptos gather too much momentum they know they're done. Stick a fork in it!
Trust is a big word. And once its gone ... ITS GONE!! The proles are arising from their slumber and they are pissed.

It's not, as much, about the blocksize increase. Although a size increase at this time is unwarranted and contributes to yet more centralisation so soon after the last effective size increase.(Segwit 1x)
Rather it is more that bitcoin would no longer adhere to its cypherpunk origins. 
2Xcoin is corporate dominated. It is not bitcoin. I personally want no part of a centralised PayPal 2.0.

Good developer overview. It cannot be stressed often enough just how critical development and excellent developers are for Bitcoin! There is quite a lot to understand and fully appreciate. Plus it's still early days with hugely important features, around privacy for example, that are still on the table.

T-800 bankster LMAO!
All joking aside, some serious stuff here. There is a global financial elite. And a New World Order has been in the works since at least the 1800s.(and possibly earlier) Full spectrum domination, centralised decision making and debt enslavement of the entire planet is the idea. One Ring to rule them all. (BIS)
And perhaps the global financial system is careening off a cliff at the moment due to the inherent contradictions between an entirely debt based system requiring unbounded resources &amp; growth on a finite planet. Not simply because of the power hungry psychopaths in charge. A bit of both I suspect. 
Debt based money is key. Confers nearly unlimited power as long as the world remains confident in the integrity of an inflating fiat reserve currency. For various reasons, this is changing however. Gold is coming back in. Through the SDR and things like the recently proposed Gold for Oil exchange in China. [De-dollarization accelerates]( And then, there's the wildcard. Decentralised cryptocurrencies.

This. Writing reliable "good" software is never easy. It takes time, often great patience, knowledge and experience. Also it helps if your developers are very smart and sceptical by nature. The combination of Security software plus P2P is as extreme as it gets. Extremely difficult to get right. And if you don't test - you die. It's that simple.

In my albeit limited understanding, UTXO growth is a fundamental given. No getting away from it. This is why I believe layer 2 solutions are so important. So the L2 discussions, which are everywhere, are an effort to work around crucial hard limitations such as unbounded UTXO growth. To really understand you need to meditate on the code. Failing that, good commentaries on the system such as Andreas Antonopolis's bitcoin book. (Mastering Bitcoin) [Jameson Lopp too](  Edit: search UTXO in r/bitcoin produced some good hits too.

Core. The cypherpunks &amp; computer scientists who understand the difficult issues that bitcoin attempts to solve. Bitcoin is not bitcoin without  decentralisation.
2X is fed/corporate coin. The vast majority of 2X corporate coin signatories belong to the Digital Currency Group or "DCG". It is clear to this observer that DCG wants to subject bitcoin to their business models. Co-opt the development process and fire the core team who have brought us this far. And if decentralisation takes a back seat (as I believe is the plan)who cares, they'll make money. Welcome PayPal 2.0.

I agree to not being unconcerned about upcoming fork. However, if I were a miner supporting 2X for a possible "greater reward" in the future - I may be starting to have second thoughts. In other words, said possible reward is a big maybe.

Of course people will have to spend money - they need to live!?!

You may be right and hopefully they have been sideswiped. And yes I think you're somewhat correct in the lack of coordination. These are early fast moving days.

I'm of the opinion that a limited dose of paranoia is healthy given the lengths that TPTB will go to to defend their turf. Not to mention their virtually unlimited financial resources.

Same as people who have had tremendous gains in bitcoin but need money for X, Y, or Z. Guess what? They cash some some BTC for fiat, or maybe buy direct with bitcoin and obtain what they need. Doesn't mean they won't buy more BTC at a later time. They'll re-up later.

And the fact that *anything* connected to the Internet is hack-able. Extremely serious issue. No, browser is the wrong model. IMHO the analogy of hardware wallets as your own personal bank vault, how bank vaults were traditionally used to store "real money" (before the CTRL-P world we live in now) is the one to push.

"We oppose the New York Agreement and the November Bitcoin SegWit2X hard fork.
Francois M. Bordeaux, France
We, members of the French speaking Bitcoin communities, want to make our voice heard regarding our opposition to the SegWit2X hard fork scheduled for next November.
The declared intention of the New York Agreement was to find a solution that would preserve the unity of the community. In recent months, it is clear that this goal can not be achieved if SegWit2X is stubborn in its current line.
We believe that BTC, the original channel, will not only survive the fork, but will continue to grow as the main channel of the Bitcoin network. The objective of this petition is to manage to limit the damage that this fork could cause in November.
We urge you, the NYA signatories, to reconsider and withdraw your support for this agreement.
Here are some of our main concerns:
The way the deal was concluded goes against the very essence of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin wants to be an open decentralized system. Open means that the discussions and the resulting decisions are made publicly and that everyone can participate freely. Decentralized means that there is no central authority-no one group can unilaterally impose changes on other participants in the system.
Indeed, the very value of Bitcoin stems from these characteristics. If a small group of CEOs and investors, no matter what their intentions are, can make decisions unilaterally on the rules of consensus without prior public discussion and impose these changes on the network without reaching a global consensus, then Bitcoin will have been dispossessed of what makes him unique and precious.
Segwit2x puts a certain risk on the network, but also ruins the opportunities offered by a properly planned and executed hard fork. All hard forks have certain risks, but they also offer the opportunity to make important corrections or updates to the protocol.
Many fixes or improvements can only be made by means of a hard fork . It would be wise to include as many of the previously validated improvements that can be implemented safely.Unfortunately, SegWit2x does not do any of this, focusing instead on a point of debate (note: the size of the blocks) and for which many technical issues are still to be solved. 
The developers and supporters of Segwit2x acted in a particularly careless manner, aggravating the risks involved.
Hard forks are intrinsically risky procedures. They must be prepared with the utmost care, the code must be properly controlled and a calendar allowing the ecosystem to prepare without unnecessary pressure must be carefully established.
The SegWit2x team is not up to the challenge, and the almost total lack of support from Core developers makes the situation even more fragile. Protection against replay is handled in a completely irresponsible way.
The current proposal is complex to implement within software that implements the Bitcoin protocol.
The SegWit2x development team initially stated that it would not offer any protection against replay. Several weeks ago, the team suddenly changed their minds and an optional method using a blacklisted address was added.
A number of serious problems inherent in this "solution" were quickly identified, and the proposal was suddenly withdrawn . Discussions are under way on the implementation of a new method. The fact that such decisions are taken and revoked without allowing the community time to analyze and criticize them, and only a few weeks from the hard fork date, should be a cause for concern. major for any company or individual using the Bitcoin protocol.
Less than 40 days from the expected hard-bus date, the community still wonders what kind of protection against replay will be proposed."

Hilarious story!! It would appear there's a shit-tonne of cognitive dissonance floating around about bitcoin.
To be fair, after following the cypherpunks &amp; remailers in the early 90s with fascination and high regard, when I first heard of bitcoin in 2009, I dismissed it out of hand. Had an identical reaction to AA: "script kiddies - nerd money etc." 
Fast forward to early 2013 when I decided to take another look. This time I read Satoshi's paper. It took all of 10 minutes for my mind to explode when I realised the true roots and innovation of bitcoin. Been hardcore ever since.

Well, blocks *on average* are mined every 10 minutes. But the next block could occasionally take well over an hour if not longer. In other words, it's not likely the ATM machine.

Well if you eliminate "scientific method, or scientific theories, or the process of developing theories, or scientists" what's left? Serious question. How are "scientific facts" then known? 
Yes, people and scientists may agree that some theories are better and more accepted than others. We agree that a particular theory is "good" or "better" than another. We value it. We agree about its "reality". But saying that your "scientific fact" exists outside of theory or the process of doing science is something else again.

That argument is extremely weak. Unfortunately what may appear to be the simplest and most direct way to scale bitcoin, is not the correct way. Correct in an engineering sense. Building and maintaining a scalable P2P trustless incentivized network of non-doubly spendable digital money is not simple and straightforward. Core is doing the very tough job of engineering this thing in the most responsible way. Responsible meaning staying true to the nature of scalable trustless P2P network of digital money.

Bitcoin is a work in progress - early days yet. Better privacy is coming. Certainly bitcoin is not perfect but it is my opinion that the current financial system in the West is past its expiry date. The value of fiat currency subject to statist control is rapidly diminishing. The price of bitcoin reflects this. People are hungry for a deflationary (falling inflation) currency that increases in value and cannot be easily confiscated. What's the point of fiat money if it's exists in a walled garden earning no interest? Fiat money subject to confiscation or degradation at a whim.

@_date: 2017-09-30 16:41:16
Meh... not buying the Big Bankers created bitcoin FUD. At all. Bitcoin is organic cypherpunk. Took decades to evolve.
The financial system "failed" in 2008 due to greed, hubris and corruption. End of story. I'm sure the bankers would have loved to party longer, yet in some ways nothing has changed and they're still partying. Moral hazard -check. Pay to play politicians - check. Money printing - check. Centrally planned and rigged "markets" - check. ZIRP/NIRP foaevaah ... check. Trillions off the books &amp; not marked to "market" - check. We're living in the Soviet era of Central Banking. How well do you think this will end?
I don't not deny that bankers find crypto technology interesting and would want to co-opt for their own purposes. But they did not invent it! Banks, like any smart business, are always looking for an edge. Also they are forever vigilant to protect their god-like power to print money at will monopoly. Gold price suppression the prime example of such vigilance. They don't like the competition!
Problem is confidence in the Wizards of Fiat is lagging. Not to mention trust. Ah trust... now that's a big word. Without trust nothing works. And once gone it's GONE.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:44:12
I would agree that there is much misunderstanding about money. However in my opinion Andreas's comments about system of control are spot on. Do you not see any issues if all transactions are digital and tracked by default? The state has a right to know everything? Really. And zero financial privacy is moral or just? Or when states decide for you how much of "your money" you may spend and for what purposes? Or how much of a haircut your account will take to bail out the banking system? That's too much power. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Just because the developed west has been fat and happy for years doesn't mean a totalitarian dystopia can never occur. In my opinion the West's banking system right now resembles a Soviet style system where the Central Bankers decide. Decide that interest rates should be zero or negative. Stealing from savers in the process. Why? To socialize bankers losses but never their gains. To further moral hazard with banks that are to big too fail and bankers too big to jail. Sorry but the current banking system is massively corrupt and broken. We, the people, need something better.
With regards to Satoshi - I find it very hard to believe he was a big fan of any statist monetary solutions. He knew what he was doing. Knew Bitcoin was a very political act. And knew that Bitcoin as another system of state control over money wasn't it. Sorry but Satoshi's roots are cypherpunk not statist.

An organisation, like any individual investor, may invest in several companies in a space that it finds "interesting". So concluding anything with certainty about DCG's motives for investing in Blockstream is problematic. Perhaps DCG has multiple reasons? At the top of the list, in my opinion, is to make money and to gain influence. No guarantees DCG receives either. Or perhaps DCG is "muddying the waters" to create a certain impression.
So, yeah, in answer to your question, DCG's investment in Blockstream most certainly can make sense, but not necessarily in the way you believe.

We're reaching the end of the global debt-based fiat ponzi line. Has lasted much longer than I thought it would. The money-changing class and the central banksters have been most accommodating and creative.
However, as some would say, all "good" things come to an end. Kick the can down the road, again and again and again. It keeps working until it doesn't. Precisely when the reckoning arrives, nobody knows. But rest assured it will. 
Moral Hazard is not to be ignored. Fraudulent, something for nothing, governments run by criminal globalist bankers,(and those of us within the system as collateral damage) will eventually pay a hefty price. Nature is not fooled. Everything has a cost.

Of course hash power is required. Duh. Nobody is saying otherwise! The point is *miners do not equal consensus*.

Agree totally that mental images are a factor in engineering decisions. But keep in mind Core are an open meritocracy. Two things about that; these guys are extremely bright and capable. Second everything is open and subject to debate. Any engineer or group of engineers that become excessively enamoured in any design with dubious merits will not last long. There have to be solid  and **testable** reasons to do anything. These guys do not design in just their heads! This is a $100+ billion experiment. 
In my opinion Core is taking *exactly* the right approach. Considering all the potential use cases is misguided. What you may refer to as a "practical use case" is in fact not. In other words, there exist overriding concerns with maintaining decentralized trustless nature of bitcoin which trump what others may consider as a "practical use case". In my opinion include what is practical without sacrificing the fundamental nature of bitcoin. The unique trustless decentralized value proposition. If you want something more centralised, use BCH. Choice is yours. Myself I will stick with bitcoin &amp; Core.

Well all I'm saying is right now we are in a rather special environment.  Apparently it is has been declared "good" to have purely debt-based "economic growth" without limit.(and trash the planet at the same time but I digress...)
Older societies, even not that long ago, before 1971, did not do this. People had lives and economies functioned. There was restraint, Gold, on the economic system. Bitcoin is a return to the paradigm that TPTB cannot simply spend "money" without limits in perpetuity. There are limits. Reversing this trend will not cause the world to end. People will still live, houses will be bought and sold, life will go on.   
And people in debt? Stay Out Of Debt. It's not a good thing! (unless for *productive assets* - and no a frickin' house ain't one - and you know you can pay it back!)

Respectfully disagree. Crony capitalism in the US has exploded since coming completely off the gold standard with Nixon. Not that it didn't exist before, but now with a currency that is is printable "at will" - well things really came off the rails since then. Having a transparent non-printable even deflationary currency is a big deal. It's a check against corrupt politicians. Also an inflationary currency is not required for "economic progress".

Possibly, but sometimes a compromise is too fundamental in nature and therefore not possible. For example - just centralise bitcoin. If that happens the entire value proposition of bitcoin goes "poof". Personally I believe the "compromise" is the state controlling what it can control, the fiat on and off ramps, and BTC keep on doing what they are doing. Not a compromise: more a balance of opposing forces.(and forces not necessarily "enemies" - different opinions, different agendas)

On-chain scaling alone will not work. It is not a viable long term solution. Another path is required. On chain scaling will inevitably destroy the decentralised nature of bitcoin. On-chain scaling will inevitably reach a point where it fails. Completely. Alternate solutions must be seriously explored sooner than later.
Naturally, scaling is not a problem if you don't care about such "externalities" as nonexistent privacy with 24/7 totalitarian surveillance, political control, massive corruption and exclusion of the majority of the world's poor. We have centralised solutions already. They're called banks. Relatively fast &amp; inexpensive until you consider the cost of giving up liberty and privacy to a mafia of corporations that for all intents &amp; purposes own you. This is the road we're heading down, yet again, with 2X.

Like I said, I personally know some people are just *fine* with it. A co-worker grew up in the USSR and pines for the Communist days. Also globalist governments in the West are moving more and more to the authoritarian left. Destroying the social fabric &amp; morality built up over millennia in the process. Not good. So yeah, I know that from a non-theoretical perspective of 60+ years on this planet, I prefer a non-authoritarian approach. 
Authoritarianism, trust in central human authorities, doesn't work well over the long term, and I'd rather not be collateral damage. Power corrupts, which is why centralized systems fail. 
Governments work better via the consent of the governed rather than solely the threat of violence.

No. Increasing the block size at this moment is not needed. It will only increase centralization which is a bad thing for trustless permissionless bitcoin. Scaling bitcoin and remaining true to its fundamental value proposition - decentralization - is not easy. Second layer scaling solutions need to be explored. Bitcoin is working fine at the moment. The 2X contingent want bitcoin to morph into Paypal 2.0 or worse.(Fedcoin) Bitcoin is true cypherpunk. 2X is anything but.

Ok so you're saying the imaginary bitcoin is used as collateral for a loan? But the loan itself cannot be imaginary bitcoin because there is no way imaginary bitcoin can be spent or verified on the blockchain.

Indeed. And I do have a watch only wallet - on Linux. 
Point I was trying to make is that I became complacent on Windows and this fact bit me. As others have mentioned here, this is a user &amp; computer security issue. I'm not blaming bitcoin. The process going to the offline wallet is not as simple as it could be and I got lazy. A blind spot. Mea culpa.
There is no room to be lax w.r.t. security on Window. Nor any platform for that matter. I was lulled into a false sense of security. And yes 2FA, which I use with other wallets, and multi-sig would probably have prevented this.

I beg to differ. What happens to Greece sets a precedent. And laws on the books are one thing, following them is another.  Dodd-Frank in the states is a good example. A bloated farce written and revised by bank lobbyists. 
The big banks continue to face large fines for breaking laws and market rigging. LIBOR and FX to name two. Cost of doing business. Like a tax. No jail time. 
How many TBTF banks have been split up since 2008? On the contrary, the big banks have gotten bigger. Instead we get "bail-in" provisions in many countries putting depositors on the hook in the event of future failures. The power of the TBTF banks is undiminished.

Running a full node is important if you wish to have full individual financial sovereignty. That is, *you* determine what the bitcoin rules are that you wish to follow. You are making a statement that the code *you* run is what you consider money. Also, you can have greater privacy and security running combinations such as Electrum Personal Server plus Electrum and a hardware wallet all connected locally to your own personal full node.

@_date: 2015-02-04 13:56:49
Yeah, sounds familiar. 
My problems started after months of use when I changed my email provider. I objected to, and made it very clear to Circle, that their practice of always sending verification email in clear text is a violation of financial privacy. How hard is it to just not send verification emails or to send an encrypted email? 
So, I thought, the least I could do would be to move away from an email provider that reads my emails, gmail, to one that doesn't. A big red flag for Circle apparently. I tried two new email providers but was told they were "not on an approved list". 
Finally got a new email acceptable to Circle but now I'm "failing the verification process". Sigh. I've stepped off the Circle bandwagon thanks. They seem more concerned about anti-fraud/KYC/AML regulations than customer service &amp; privacy. Worse than a bank.

Electrum, the official version, (*always* verify the signature!), is pretty good. Of course, it's software. Software implies bugs, but bugs get fixed and Electrum has been around forever in bitcoin terms, so somewhat battle tested. It has some very good features. Especially useful is the hardware wallet integration. I also like Chris Belcher's extension, the  Electrum Personal Server, which allows you to connect to your own full node to Electrum for greater privacy.
For greater bitcoin security also highly recommend using multiple hardware wallets with multi-sig addresses in combination with Electrum as shown in this recent demo: 
Edit: also agree with the comments about the underlying OS being a bigger worry than Electrum. Important to keep the private keys in no way connected to the internet! Decent HW wallet will accomplish that.

This morning 5 infected items turned up by MalWareBytes in my AppData temp folder. 4 exe's with numbered names and an infected Adobe_Updater exe. 
A few days ago I was cruising the bitcoin/new section and clicked on an outrageous link purporting to be from ZeroHedge. (something about GB banning institutions from using BTC) It was only there for a second - then vanished. But after I clicked I was able to notice the address was zerohedgeSH something. I.E. very suspicious. I scanned my computer but nothing turned up. 
Later that morning I got a 2FA notice from bitcoininfo. WTF? I never keep anything there but somebody was obviously trying. I should have been more careful and rescanned - duh.
Another interesting thing is that my Ububtu VM Player machine was deleted! Why would they do that? There's nothing on it - but I had it backed up offline. 
Anyway time to reformat and rebuild the OS I guess. I can't not use Windows unfortunately - its for work.

Hmmm....not sure I follow. You work in the US so either; deposit USD cash or wire from your US bank or direct deposit from your employer into the "true" US bank which happens to be subsidiary of RBC.(RBC Georgia) Of the big Canadian banks RBC is unique by having a true USD subsidiary BTW. Then it's just a button click on a webpage, at a 1:1 rate, to transfer to RBC USD held in Canada.(if u have setup your RBC Georgia USD account to be linked to your RBC Canada USD account)
Likely no "shopping around" in TO with currency people for the best deal. Your funds are held in USD by RBC Canada and u accept the currency conversion rate they publish at time of conversion. (don't expect "spot" inter-bank price either unless you're dealing multiple 7 figures) Recently I noticed USD/CAD was 1.25 real-time spot but RBC would only give me 1.21 for "small" amounts.

Excellent question. I have been using encrypted wallets for a long time, but always - no. Perhaps there was an unencrypted one from years ago somewhere.

Yes I can appreciate what you have said and mostly agree. And it does somewhat come down to personal preference. Trezor and Ledger are both similar in purpose and perform as advertised.
Trezor One has come down in price I think, but yes the Model T is not cheap.
Other things to note: any words typed on a computer for the older Trezor are scrambled, but yes that's a bit bothersome. (can mitigate; use Tails, **never**  type into Windows, and disconnect from net depending on what you are doing) Also I find the combination of Trezor and Electrum (and *Electrum Personal Server*) with multisig useful. (although of course you may substitute Ledger for Trezor in this combination) The firmware upgrade process on the Ledger, I do not like at all - very confusing. And lastly, Ledger corporate culture is not as transparent and responsive as Satoshi Labs.

@_date: 2018-12-18 15:09:13
Not at all. If governments lose the moral authority to govern they are ignored. Bitcoin is free speech. And it enables a common human need - the transfer of value securely and verifiably without coercion.
Yes you can shut down the on/off ramps but that will have unintended consequences. The more rapid adoption of BTC for goods &amp; services directly. Or movement of exchanges and services to more friendly locales. Bitcoin is not going away.
Inexorably, fiat premined crony capitalist inflationist shitcoins and the entire high time preference Wizard of Oz modern finance Potemkin village will return to whence it came. 
Bitcoin is censorship resistant hard money which cannot be uninvented. The cat is out of the bag. More and more people worldwide are catching on to what a scam Central Bankster fiat money is. Slowly and with great volatility yet inevitably, money governed by math, money/value as a distibuted protocol, or as AA is fond of saying "an internet content type", will win out.

This. He's very anti-gold. He just doesn't get some things. Gold &amp; Bitcoin both are contra to his *modus operandi*. 
And in a sense he has a point. "Hard" money, such as bitcoin and gold, shouldn't really be considered an investment like a stock. But our current fiat money environment is so insane that holding "hard money" actually makes sense as a speculative investment. The current system is irretrievably broken (from an inflation protection or wealth preserving point of view) as it results in endless money printing. And may inevitably be eclipsed by the modern variant of hard money - bitcoin.

No you were clear actually, I misread. But the argument still stands. BTC is a much better store of value than LTC and with lightning any cheapness or speed advantage that LTC has over BTC is irrelevant. BTC, IMHO, works best as a store of value, digital Gold if you will, and lightning only enhances BTC's value proposition by providing easy fast and cheap payments on top of BTC. In other words, with lightning it is irrelevant how much cheaper or faster LTC is than the base BTC layer.
Edit: so yes, to answer your original question, from a speed and cheapness point of view I would agree that Lightning makes LTC "useless". However I would not say LTC is useless. It serves as a wonderful testbed for BTC and may perform a privacy function by using atomic swaps with BTC. So I am reluctant to call LTC "useless".

Fragile systems, financial or otherwise, by definition are prone to breaking. Think porcelain dish. Predicting the when is a fool's game. However, sooner or later fragile systems break.
The modern complex debt based financial system, to these eyes anyway, seems very fragile. Increasingly outrageous duct-taping and bailing wire "fixes" are required. Examples include; too big to fail/too big to jail systemically important institutions, QE, SDRs, increasing top-down social control and schemes to eliminate cash, negative interest rates and war on saving, austerity and globalist New World Order governance. In the grand scheme of things the current debt based system is hardly long lived either. 
As always, time will tell, but my gut says the system has already been in a slow motion crash since 1971 when the last constraint to temperance and rationality was removed. (Nixon "temporarily" closing the Gold window)
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:42:00
Once upon a time precious metals were commonly used as money. Importantly this money came before pieces of paper, having zero intrinsic value, became accepted as "money". Why is this order important? It demonstrates both the slippery slope that banking interests use to condition the public as well as the fact of the subjective quality of money. Ultimately who do you trust to define what has value as money? Corruptable individuals or systems of corrupt individuals or a widely distributed system of incentives based upon math? Not to mention that Bitcoin cleverly turns the "greed" of its participants to the positive use of maintaining the viability of distributed consensus.

If an Electrum Personal Server is connected to your bitcoin full node, querying your addresses and sending transactions originate via the node you control.

Also just because something is a medical "study" doesn't mean it's of ultimate value. Could just be fashionable belief - yes even in supposedly scientific medicine.

And armies of troll accounts form part of this 1 million. Comes with the territory. Also, the trolls certainly become more visible when the price drops.
Not complaining, simply noting how the ecosystem works. Make no mistake, this is a fight to the death. Many entrenched interests are threatened by the existence of cryptos - especally BTC.

The precious metals are complementary to bitcoin. Gold and Silver have a long history as money. They're called precious for reasons having nothing to do with government mandates. Use either bitcoin or the metals depending on circumstances.

1. No
2. No
But crypto-currency evolution hasn't stopped either. Look at p2p file-sharing systems for some clues as to how well central authorities have "destroyed" them.

I don't believe you are alone in your sentiments. The current monetary system is one of world-wide financial repression to the benefit of unproductive members of society via an out of control debt-based fiat money system. Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come. An idea that is here to stay and is growing. Vive la revolution!

Of course in the case of bitcoin, inflation is limited and deterministic. No corrupt central authority, no taxes, no guns.

Yes. This and wider adoption.

Good interview. Especially liked his comments on regulation and fungibility. Spot on.
