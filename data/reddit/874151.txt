If it drops again it’ll be at like 1k and everyone will be screaming and selling and pronouncing it dead, and us poor ass mother fuckers will finally have a decent price to buy at.

Fortunately, paper money is comprised mostly of cotton, so that won’t be a problem. Growing cotton is far easier than growing trees, so we can rely on paper currency long after we destroy the planet.

Sounds like the type of thing someone would say to get the dumb money buying, so he can take the other side of the trade.

The funds aren’t the important part, it’s that the bank, who is supposed to be trustworthy, stole his money.

Crypto theft never happens. You can steal from exchanges and websites, but you can’t hack the blockchain.

Agreed. Almost every symbol for currency has weird hash marks, bitcoin included. We’re out to solve a lot of problems, but the little icons we use for money don’t need to be changed.

As a food service-y person, were I not already into crypto I’d probably just let it expire unless it was a lot. Like 50 bucks would get me to learn how to use crypto, 5 bucks would not.
Edit: so we should all get so rich off the next bull run (if it happens) to leave $50 tips in bitcoin everywhere we go.

If Assange was an unbiased publisher of information like Snowden, more people would be sympathetic to his cause. But he’s extremely politically motivated, and therefore alienates a lot of would be supporters, myself included.
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:49:44
Well, yeah but you’re oversimplifying it. Crypto regulation did not cause this situation to occur, online gambling regulation did. Coinmama has a responsibility to stay away from online gambling, not track their users’ crypto movements. The tracking is to fulfill the gambling requirement.

There’s a third type of person that has seen governments like New Zealand’s, where there isn’t corruption and also government control, and hopes for a world where all democracies can operate like that.

Which party is that? I’ve not identified the parts of Assange that i dislike. Only that he’s politically motivated and that I don’t approve.
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:19:13
Almost nothing is regulated, which is why there are so many situations like this

4 more years of trump would be disastrous, from a legal perspective. The things going on in the news are largely unimportant compared to the actions of right wing activists currently being appointed to the courts.

I dunno. My phone case is also my wallet, and I never keep more than 50 bucks in there right now in case somebody steals my phone. If we treat the Samsung wallet like a Fiat wallet, it can be used relatively safely.
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:29:47
If safety suddenly doesn’t exist then we might as well use the Samsung wallet. For convenience, which does exist.

I’d rather put in a little extra work into backing up my shit than continue to allow banks and their governments to keep control over the money supply. A lot of are in this for the decentralization, and that’s why banks are “bad”

Lol we’re never retiring, don’t be ridiculous
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:06:27
I’m exactly where you are. 2k to my name, and looking to maybe retire one day. The question I keep asking myself is “will you miss this 2k when you’re 60” and the answer is a hard no, I’m not going to be thinking about the 2k I had 30 years prior. So throw it all into eth and maybe jump start a retirement fund of sorts.
