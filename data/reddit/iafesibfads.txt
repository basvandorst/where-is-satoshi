What paywall? There's a PDF on the linked page. 


50% FP rate means that your SPV client on your iPhone will be downloading 16 GB of data from the network and then throwing it out. This is in most people's books at least, completely unreasonable. I don't think you could convince many users to to do this, and even if you could it would be glacier slow.

If you read the paper you'll find this offers almost no improvement, even at 50% false positive rates. Nodes today don't retain their filters, so it's even possible to bump SPV clients into revealing two filters which you can intersect and remove the false positive hits from. If you are using an SPV wallet you need to accept that you have zero privacy. Maybe that's a reasonable tradeoff for you, maybe not.

Someone decided to give people a financial incentive to spam.

This is an incredible waste of time. You can't "check the block chain" in any reasonable setup without scanning the entire 30GB or maintaining many gigabytes more of address indexes. No wallet does this "check", even if they did your RNG can be very broken and never reveal duplicates to so it would be false security.

Not that they see any of the network fee at all.

That sort of thinking gets you into all sorts of messes. Are you really suggesting that every time a wallet makes a new address, it reveals this fact to blockchain.info? You'd be foolish to think that they don't record every hit you make to their site, it even mentions this in the documentation.

You don't. That's why it's an estimate. We have no solid statistics how many people are connected to those 7000 listening. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:20:50
7000 with listening sockets. More like 80,000 total.

With that trusted setup? DH exchanges are trivially attacked with a man in the middle.

All you need to do is look at the first 4 bytes and bin the connection if they are 0xF9BEB4D9. The Bitcoin P2P protocol doesn't pretend to be censorship resistant. Even if it did, you could just connect to the node your suspicious peer is connecting to and just discover if it is a Bitcoin node that way. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:32:11
No, it's trivial to block Bitcoin due to it's very obvious message bytes. Changing the IP or port does nothing to prevent it being easily filtered by even the dumbest packet inspection setup.

It's not using some random USB chip off the shelf that accepts any firmware upgrade, this is what that attack is talking about. That said, the processor they have chosen has very little to no protection against more interesting attacks. It's not a high security device by any means, quite contrary to the advertising.

The port number isn't fixed, but the reason we avoid using anything but 8333 is so that the address rumoring system can't be used to DoS other services. Otherwise you could advertise your node running at bitcointalk.org:80 and cause all the nodes in the network looking for a new peer to attempt to connect to the HTTP socket fruitlessly.


There can never be strong encryption on Bitcoin nodes, it will always be able to be man in the middle attacked due to peers having no way of authenticating the peer data they receive.

Unless you use an iPhone, which encrypts the flash with a key. When you do a "restore" of the device it burns over that portion of flash, effectively destroying the contents of the encrypted portion. As far as hardware security goes iOS is quite impressive compared with Android.

Extrapolation from the 60 or so people connected to my node.

None are public at the moment. 
Just from a general standpoint, the STM32 series of processors are not designed for high security.
