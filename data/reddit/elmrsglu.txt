You have no idea how law works do you?

Regulations exist for establishing guidelines that everyone can follow so when they need to sue, they have a framework to work with.
*Regulations are not bad in general*, but if those who have a hand in the creation of regulations are corrupt, then the outcome will be negative. It would take a complaint or lawsuit to shine the light on the problem--by then it'll already have been abused for the wrong purposes.
edit: downvoted for the truth on how the system is supposed to work? This is why 'MURICA is in the shithole it's in--no one understands how the system is actually supposed to operate.

The vast majority of people who drive for Uber do it on the side to supplement their income whether they're paid at or below a livable wage (some do it for fun but they're the minority). Those who are in tight situations are more likely to not take the time to fight for being paid a better wage. You need people, like Bernie, on their side to help them get a leg up so they're *able* to push for better wages.
It's the same reasoning of using your bootstraps to pull yourself up, but not mentioning you do better when people are around you to help.

You've been drinking the kool-aid way too much there kiddo. Stop being an arm-chair preacher and activist; learn how the system works so you can better understand how to change it.
No professional enjoys non-professionals "telling them how it should be" when they know jack shit, but know some information thanks to the internet.

See, if they had *actually* stopped a plot using the powers they have of surveillance, they would be all over that--hyping it as verifiable proof that they did what they "set out to do." But they have yet to prevent anything.
To paraphrase Barbarella, "The old ways are best." As in, profiling people.

Why do you think you're equipped with the pertinent information to make suggestions on how the law ought to be when you clearly have no idea how it operates?

Incumbents are allowed to exist because voters don't vote them out.

Age is a factor yes, but the main point is that Bernie actively attempts to educate himself at the topics at hand to have a firmer grasp of the situation. *Or* this is why you add someone to your team that is knowledgeable in that area where you are not.
Don't rip someone because of their age--rip someone when they actively refuse to use facts to support their claims.

To speed up law would create more pitfalls than one would think. Law was never created with being quick in mind--it's built on judgments by judges/justices/magistrates as well as statutes and regulations by legislation or agencies respectively. Laws are created then challenged which is how we get to where we are today.
It's not great, but to give proper suggestions on how to fix the problem requires those supplying the suggestions to know how the system works. Being an outsider and saying "Let's do it this way!" is not how it should be approached.

Uber won't be banned, they'll be told to adhere to regulations specifically tailored for this new ride-"sharing" industry and as well as they should be regulated. Both good and bad things happen, but regulations exist to lessen the extent of bad things.

Side thought: how many terror/"terror" attacks have happened since the Patriot Act was enacted, or the widening of surveillance powers, and how many incidents have been claimed to be thwarted by agencies with the power of surveillance?
