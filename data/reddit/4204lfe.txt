"we are closely following developments and keeping in touch with other authorities.” 
“are an interesting phenomenon and should not be ignored or dismissed"
They are watching.

If it's not positive news it gets destroyed here. It's pathetic and sad. It seems like 90% of the people here are kids that only upvote stories they think will boost the value of the single bitcoin they own.

Don't worry still time: to self destruct...

...and they keep blowing smoke up 'your' ass

quick downvote it's not positive news

Isn't there also some guy here that's been successful at recovering lost coins? Think he gets 20% if I'm not mistaken.  I wonder what these guys charge.

Mulling: think about (a fact, proposal, or request) deeply and at length.
For those who see the title don't understand and insta down vote.

How many times do coins need to be stolen before people realize this. Cold storage - the end.

They're running scared now boyz!

If you didn't see this coming you had bitcoin blinders on.

Every keeps saying regulation doesn't matter but it does. Large business won't adopt bitcoin if the powers that be don't "legitimize it".

Not at all, mulling is not a commonly used word. SebastianMaki nailed it on the head.

Up, down, up, down.... China in, China out.... tired of hearing about it.

To the Moon! All kidding aside I don't see nearly as many "OMG bitcoin will be worth 100k next year" posts which is good.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:36:12
...and 'O Canada' continues to stifle the growth of bitcoin there.

Started as a pump and dump but I think this will turn into more of an ETH equivalent.

Bitcoin has always sounded better this just reinforces the facts.
