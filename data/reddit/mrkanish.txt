People in horribly impoverished nationals with no running water will love to figure out how to spend an electronic currency that goes to 8 signifigant figures if it scaled globally.  
(this will never happen)

Part of the problem with the 2008 crisis was that no one was lending money but instead saving it, causing the economy to grind to a halt.

This doesnt include benefits and future pension payouts.

HA bitcoin is the future!

But why tout it as a feature then? Ive heard it broguht up numerous times, as a plus for businesses to adopt bitcoin. 
Why would anyone bother with escrow for relatively small purchases?
such convenience!

Right its cash when it suits bitcoin. When it applies to merchants accepting bitcoin then it becomes a way for quick, easy, untraceable payments.
If someone sets up a "paypal" of bitcoin or a "visa" of bitcoin, arent you going to run into many of the same problems you have with current payment processing?
In your example, it is akin to me buying somethign online and mailing an envelope of cash. Which in this day and age is not very smart. 
If I need someone else controlling "my" money to have consumer protection, what the hell is the difference?

So hypothetically btc takes over and you go right back to having a very similar system you all rally against? 
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:55:13
Haha or you could just say no. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:45:27
Those "pen" signatures look fake as hell.

But that will require a third party, leaving you with big reputable institutions that hold your bitcoins and make transaction on your behalf with layers of protection in exchange for fees and such..
So... like a bank then? But bitcoiners hate big banks or anyone who touches their money.

Im not talking about the housing bubble, but rather the ensuing credit crunch. The impact on an economy when  noone can borrow.
With bitcoin, what incentive would I have to lend anyone anything with a deflationary currency. Theres no risk, and my wealth only increases with time.
Or as a borrower, I could borrow but the interest rate would have to overtake deflation (to make it worth their risk) but the costs of me paying this loan back are growing exponentially due to deflation.
Its very simple. Borrowing/Lending is an essential part of economic growth (greater regulation necessary though)
