You and me both. I'm buying them all if it. I'll be fighting over bitcoin like a pitbull that has been fed gunpowder.

At that point the transaction fees will pay the miners. I know that sounds like a losing deal right now but think about a $1m bitcoin. At that point transaction fees will be pretty close to what those coin drops are now.
Edit: As for the last bitcoin, it's expected to be around 2040.

Dude, are you selling essential oils on the side while not vaccinating your kids? How about well thought out posts with citations? When you post bullshit like this you look like a fool.

The best time to invest in bitcoin was a few years ago. The second best time is now.
