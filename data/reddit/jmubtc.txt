Are you doing anything to convince businesses to hold a certain percentage of their bitcoin earnings? I know it's difficult because of the volatility, but it would be a huge boon for the Bitcoin economy if some businesses started to interact with each other using bitcoin. 
Basically, what strategies are you developing to support the Bitcoin economy besides the services you already offer?

@_date: 2014-07-30 16:46:50
Where and when did Simple state that they are bitcoin friendly? I remember another user stating that they weren't. Also, BBVA Compass, who owns Simple, is not bitcoin friendly (unless they changed their policy yesterday following the removal of the FDIC's hit list) I have an account with Simple, but I haven't attempted to use it for bitcoin purchases

The price mainly comes from speculation. Many people think that Bitcoin can develop into something big. It's basically betting on the future. Bitcoin is still flawed in many ways, but if it ever realizes it's full potential, then $200 or $500 coins are a huge bargain. High risk - high reward. People stand to lose everything or make a small fortune

Some people have their purchases cancelled because they are deemed high-risk. I don't know how they determine this, but it's never happened to me and it's not a scam as some people tend to believe. I made a purchase last week when the price was around $330, and I received them today. As others have already said, price fluctuations won't affect your purchase. You get exactly what you paid for initially.

It's true that dollars are everywhere in Russia, but people don't use them for purchases. It's very easy to exchange dollars, and the rates are good, so a lot of people use the dollars as a store of value.
@_date: 2014-09-02 04:52:30
If anonymity is that important to you, then yes, localbitcoins is probably the way to go. As I understand, you can also use a mixer to provide anonymity if you purchase from a place like Coinbase, but I've never tried this and don't really know anything about it. You can try googling it or asking someone else here how it works. Also, localbitcoins has nothing to do with a secure wallet

The simple truth is that your sales are minimal, and only a fraction of the general population uses bitcoin at the moment. Thus, it's unlikely that a random bitcoin user will stumble upon your site (outside of reddit, of course)
But one option you can use is to introduce potential customers to bitcoin. Advertise two prices for your products: one is the normal price, and the second is the price if paying with bitcoin. If customers see that they can save money, then they might be willing to look into bitcoin and purchase some.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:36:04

I will be blunt with you. It sounds like investing in bitcoin is not for you at the moment. But here are some tips for you: 
Invest only what you're willing to lose. 
Plan on investing long-term. Stop trying to just get rich quick.
Learn about what Bitcoin offers and get excited about it because of those reasons, not because it can just make you some money.

A little note on additional fees: The other day I sent some bitcoin from my Xapo wallet and the transaction fee was .001, or about 57 cents. I imagine this fee will also be attached to any debit card purchases, so be aware of that.

First of all, you don't need to buy a full bitcoin. You can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin for as little as you like. If you don't feel like buying even a dollars worth of bitcoin, you can always offer to do some work or provide some sort of service and ask to be paid in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:22:40
Okay, he replied and here is what he said: It's true that BBVA won't deal with bitcoin in any way because the banking regulators have advised US banks to stay away from it due to too much corruption and uncertainty surrounding it in addition to no regulation. 
He didn't say anything about this a couple of weeks ago when I talked to him, so I feel like this is a recent development. Maybe we will start to see a lot more of the big American banks turning away bitcoin customers. 
To be honest, this sounds really bad for bitcoin. But I also feel like bitcoin has already gained too much momentum, and there's no putting the cat back in the bag, so to speak. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:05:52

My uncle is one of the vice presidents at BBVA, so I will email him and ask about this. I talked to him a couple of weeks ago about bitcoin, and he said that they are currently watching it.

It seems to me that BBVA Compass would be one of the more likely banks to be bitcoin friendly, but I will email my uncle and see what he says about this.

There's a steep learning-curve to securing your own bitcoin, and many novices can't trust themselves to do everything properly. Of course there are huge risks in trusting a 3rd party to store your bitcoins, but sometimes those risks are lower for people who are less technologically savvy. Minus the MtGox debacle, the majority of the horror stories you read about are from people who mess up trying to secure their own bitcoin. 
If you feel like you can trust Coinbase to not disappear overnight, then I think their vault is an excellent tool to use. At the very least, it's a nice option to have for people who are looking for an easy security solution.
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:24:06
But it is about Bitcoin. I get what you're saying, but they're not treating Bitcoin the same as dollars or euros. From what I understand, they will crack down on mining and purchasing bitcoin. They will also restrict websites that provide information about cryptocurrencies. Here's what I don't understand. RT (Russia Today) is the English language news site run by the Russian government. RT seems to push bitcoin pretty hard, which is in complete contrast to what the Russian gov't is doing. Any theories on why they're doing this?

Yes, that's likely the best way to get bitcoins anonymously, but you will generally pay a higher price if you go this route. If you go through a service like Coinbase, then you have to understand that they are required by law to gather personal information about you.

I like the idea of advertising a discount at checkout if you use bitcoin. That will get people's attention. However, a discount of 9% is going to eat into profits and shareholders will be none too happy about that. I don't see this being feasible unless it's with a smaller business and the owner is willing to eat the losses (and such a business probably wouldn't be big enough to affect the landscape very much)

@_date: 2014-09-11 02:44:14
I feel like any effects will most likely be limited to traditional currencies, particularly the pound. There will be people who dump the pound due to the uncertainty, but I don't see any clear reasons as to why they would store their money in bitcoin, considering that they are trying to protect themselves from volatility. Thus, I don't predict any major movements, either up or down.

They aren't the only bank doing this. BBVA Compass was also taking a wait-and-see approach but is now refusing to work with any businesses that work with Bitcoin. I imagine that other banks will follow suit until there is more regulation or guidance in dealing with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-07-09 07:56:56
I appreciate you trying to present both sides of the argument, but I don't agree with the logic. I'm not hating on the Foundation out of principle or because I think we should get rid of it. I just think that their important role deserves oversight and they should be held accountable for their actions (or lack thereof).
Think of it like Congress. They are currently very unpopular as a whole because of how they are performing their jobs. If one congressman were to get busted right now in a huge corruption scandal, you can be sure that all of Congress would feel the public's wrath. That doesn't mean people want to get rid of Congress. They just want such an important body to function the way it should be functioning.

I made a purchase from them and had no problems. And their support always answered my questions promptly.

@_date: 2014-07-26 16:09:47
I completely agree. I use BoA and haven't had any problems, but I feel like they could change their policy any day. A credit union is definitely the best option and I won't hesitate to start using one if I ever have even the slightest problem with my bank.

Would you make the same argument in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia? Or what about the Westborough Baptist church people? 
Edited for clarity, as people missed my point: Fanatical religious people and the supporters of horrific regimes are also "cheerleaders." But they can't see their faults because they are blinded by their own fanaticism. Bitcoin still needs to be improved, and we shouldn't ignore its shortcomings in a fanatical way. No, I don't think bitcoiners are Nazis.

I used them recently when they had a no-fee promotion. I couldn't link my bank account so ended up sending a check for my purchase.

Again, the point was that some people's actions amount to more than cheerleading. I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin and cheer it on. Bitcoin isn't the problem. The problem is that sometimes people raise valid concerns about Bitcoin, and these people are then attacked with an almost religious fervor. This is the behavior I'm criticizing. It prevents rational debate that can help strengthen Bitcoin.

Are you serious? I wouldn't let this slide. The police officer clearly overstepped and abused his powers. You should seek an explanation from the department, and possibly legal recourse. If you don't have the resources for hiring a lawyer, then contact your local paper and news stations and get this story out where everyone can see it. 
Not only does this constitute unlawful search and seizure, but it sounds like it could be racially motivated. I wish you luck, smartyhands

It seems to be pushing for 400 USD now. But one explanation might be that today is a banking holiday in the US.
@_date: 2014-09-02 21:22:11
I think you misunderstand how markets work.
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:55:54
That's not true. I purchased from them and they always responded to my emails. They aren't scammers. But I will say that I still prefer Coinbase or Circle
@_date: 2014-09-02 04:31:39
Yes, Coinbase is safe and reputable

For most people, their current currency already works for them and there isn't enough of an incentive to adopt bitcoin. There's a large learning curve to fully understand bitcoin's advantages and how it works. And there are the security concerns of being your own bank. Bitcoin won't go mainstream until it's easier to adopt and use safely. You have to understand that we're still the early adopters and are working on getting the kinks out of the system. The problems are being fixed, but bitcoin still isn't ready for mass-adoption at this moment.

Thank you, kinoshitajona!!! I hope your fortunes increase 1,000 times!

Thank you for the reply. I'm curious how their vault storage compares to Coinbase's, especially considering that you have to pay a fee. As far as I understand, the service is free at Coinbase. Nonetheless, I'm happy to see another company receiving some serious financing. But I think I will wait on the sidelines for a bit until they develop more of a reputation. I just really don't like all of the permissions that their app asks for.
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:01:48
Woohoo, it was 408 exactly!!!
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:10:59
It's a problem that I always have with their app. Usually when I try to log in to the app, it fails to load. But keep trying, because it always works eventually

Sure, I can spell it out. I was talking about some people here being overzealous and blinded to reality. Another poster said these people are simply "cheerleaders." My point was that people in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or even fanatical religious people could be described as "cheerleaders", but this isn't a good thing. When people become too fanatical about something, they are unable to view it objectively. 
Somehow that was interpreted as meaning that bitcoiners are Nazis, which was not my point, as I'm passionate about Bitcoin too. I'm concerned about Bitcoin's image, and the behavior of some people gives us, and Bitcoin, a bad reputation. But I agree with you that I could've made my point better by using a different analogy.

No, you edited your post to make it look like you did.
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:21:14
In what sense?

What are the fees for trucoin?

It won't let me tip that much, so I'll break it up for you.
@_date: 2014-09-11 15:44:03
In that case, just sit back and relax. And you don't need to apologize for your English. I respect anybody who can speak more than one language.
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:34:05
I agree, it's stupid that they would do that if you're not buying or selling bitcoin. As for wallets, I recommend Mycelium or Greenaddress
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:41:24
Your title is a bit misleading. The article doesn't mention Bitcoin as an alternative
@_date: 2014-09-05 04:21:42
Because it's reddit, and there are some people who always downvote stuff. Your question is a good one for discussion, so don't take it personally
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:16:47
Bitcoin has an awesome blender! Fiat's appliances really can't compare

I prefer the alternative symbol (without the circle around it), though I know I'm definitely in the minority. To me it seems more serious and legitimate. The original symbol also can be confused with the Thai Baht. But I predict the original symbol is here to stay, and I don't have any problems with that.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:00:18
Yeah, it looks like they're really trying to push it through $400. It should happen later today. I was shocked when I saw the price shoot up to $395 almost instantly
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:53:05
This article is only part of a larger special report. Part of the report is exclusively on Bitcoin and the blockchain

And they make almost all of their money by selling oil on the global market. If people ignore this and choose to focus solely on bitcoin, it makes you question their motives.
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:05:05
The article you linked to has nothing in common with the title of this thread
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:45:20
Right now Russia is trying to prevent capital flight and save their struggling ruble. I agree that Russia could benefit from bitcoin in the long term, but they will discourage its use as long as the ruble is in the shitter.
