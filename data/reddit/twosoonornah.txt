Lol mining gold from asteroids will never happen.
What next you'll tell me a company called "space X", or something futuristic, can launch and land remote rockets on a moving barge in the ocean. 
Good luck on that ever happening in the next 56,000 years! I'm going to hang on to my gold so I can buy a brand new horse or for you out of touch internet coiners, When Horse?

Sadly that's probably 100s of years away with our current technology.

$7 a week? Then you have absolutely zero business buying crypto.
Instead buy lettuce seeds and wheat seeds and start farming bud!
