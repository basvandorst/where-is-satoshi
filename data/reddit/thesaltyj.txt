This body language analysis is equivalent to homeopathy. This makes crypto people look ridiculous and whiny.

1A8bpC.. is your wallet or the hacker's? Because this wallet currently holds 0.37 btc

Well, he did not lie as he smartly avoided using any reference to purchasing power of that euro. What I like is that he says that the EZB does not want to ban Bitcoin, let's see for how long. In the best case many dudes in higher ranks start to stack bitcoin and want it to succeed :D

what bothers me the most about this body language interpretation stuff is that you can literally talk from hindsight... you can fit every movement or gesture to your story...

stupid, with increasing market power Bitcoin would not be adopted by people who care about decentralization

slight and stable inflation is actually a good thing... nothing worse than a deflationary currency

the thing which bothered me most is: why so many double spaces in your text?

Mh if there was pressure on Kraken from law enforcement that he has done something illegal I would assume that they freeze the account instead of giving him the opportunity to leave with crypto. Also liquidity is not an argument since they are forcing him to eat up the order books??!

I don't talk about paragraphs, there are double spaces everywhere

blablabla

You didn't understand: I meant that if it is outlawed and people say they would use it anyway they are criminals

Thank you for the first real answer to my question. How likely is it that tools like Tor and VPNs can protect against this? I hear often that they do not provide the security people seek.

Well I understand that argument, but it is very unlikely that then we are able to change the system as it is. It will stay a currency for criminals...
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:32:55
What does that have to do with FUD? I am just asking a critical question... 
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:05:38
Yes I see this argument, but it would kill adoption

Do ISPs actually have the power to report you for running a node? I guess so, right?
