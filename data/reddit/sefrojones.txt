* 1: I think they are probably using [OP_RETURN]( in their transactions
* 2: Depends on who you ask.
* 3: It would get expensive very quick. If I recall correctly, you can only include 40 bytes of data in an OP_RETURN at a cost of ~2 cents per transaction.

I have sold some bitcoin on ebay in the past. While chargebacks are a real concern, if you have some minimum requirements for bidders, such as this listing, you can mitigate some of the risk. I am not saying it's 100% safe, but I have never been charged back for an ebay cryptocurrency sale.

You don't need a pi or even a PC to use an antminer S1 (beyond initial setup). Once it is on your network and pointed at your pool, it's good to go all on it's own.

I've mined about .5 BTC in the last 8 weeks with three S1s, and while I am only making slightly more in BTC than I am paying in electricity, I am also using them to help heat my living room. They have fully replaced an electric heater and my electric bill is slightly less than it was last year. I will probably be shutting them down by the spring/summer. I am only a hobbyist miner, and hold all the bitcoin that I mine.

It's not idiotic, it's math. You are asking about mining with old, outdated miners.
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:34:23
Block eruptors are old outdated hardware. Anyone mining bitcoins these days is using newer machines with much more hashing power. Your 6 block eruptors will mine at around 2 GH/s, which is basically nothing. You can buy a used 180 Gh/s Antminer S1 for ~$35 these days, and you can get a 1000 gh/s miner for ~$400.

Less than 10, but the fact is that none of them were charged back, and all of the listings sold at a substantially higher price than the exchanges. I definitely worried about charge backs even though the buyers had met my minimum requirements (which were similar to this listing). Either I was extremely lucky, or there aren't as many people charging back as the folks in this thread would have you believe. I haven't sold any coins on ebay in the last year, so things may have changed. 
EDIT: I was told by ebay, while on the phone requesting a limit increase, that I would now need to list any digital currencies as a classified ad. I never made a classified listing, and the situation could feasibly be different now than it was last year.

I sold a bit of bitcoin on ebay a couple of years ago, and was lucky enough to sell to customers who did not charge back. Since then, I have seen nothing but posts about people being charged back. I understand the desire to make a quick buck, especially after doing a quick search of completed bitcoin sales on ebay. I suspect a lot of the sold listings are artificially inflated to inspire others to greedily list their own bitcoins for a higher than market value, which are then bought, received and charged back. Not only do you NOT get a much higher than market value price, you also lose your coin. Doesn't seem worth the risk. Also as pointed out, you'd be broke in a month if you tried to insure people selling bitcoin for PayPal.

I know I'll be downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but I have had nothing but an excellent experience with PayPal. Over the last few years I have had several attempted chargebacks, and PayPal has sided with me every time. I have been accepting bitcoin on my sites as well as traditional methods. I have made thousands of sales since adding bitcoin to my payment options, and not a single customer has tried to pay with bitcoin. I am a huge fan bitcoin - I mine, run a full node, and use bitcoin regularly. That being said, bitcoin is just not ready to kill PayPal just yet, although in the future it quite possibly could replace it.
