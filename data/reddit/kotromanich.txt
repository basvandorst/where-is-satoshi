These people want to sort it out via card, while on the phone or laptop.

Selling clothes from Turkey. Have 80k+ instagram page with large number  of regular customers. Would be great to avoid couple of payments on my  company accounts, taxes are high, times are tough...

These are the people who want to pay online, and want to pay within couple of hours.

Not from 3 of my customers in UK. They added the card but couldn't figure out how to buy bitcoin... I can't download it it's not supported in the country I am in currently. Opening a new boutique so I won't be home in Turkey for about a week or so...

Thank you. How long does the identity verification takes?
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:39:50
That's great, the fees are kinda ok, is it possible that verification is done under 3h?

You didn't get what I'm trying to say. Nevermind.

None of the people I suggest it to could figure out how to buy bitcoin on it. There's no bitcoin button like on the videos.

I understand, that's what I am trying to do. But, the transaction needs to be done by people who have not used cryptocurrencies before.   
It needs to be instant, and it needs to be without any special verifications. The transaction process needs to be simple.

How fast does it process credit/debit card payments? 
What are the limits? 
Does it require identity verification? How fast is the verification if it does. 
Thank you

I think you don't understand me here. Thanks either way.

Thanks. We searched everywhere, and currently due to some new regulations there is not a single company offering a customer to buy and send crypto without some type of verifications.   
Too bad...

Sending from UK, Australia and NZ mostly.
