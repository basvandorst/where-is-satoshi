Once butcoin mining cost becomes not effective they stop mining in this place. They do not spend money just to mine all gold, they mine when it's profitable. The same for Bitcoin. While mining is profitable, hashrate will grow

LN is ok. Instant off-chain payments. Impossible to track who paid whom. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:47:23
No any reason to make Bitcoin beyond pow. Pow is what makes the money - money.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:34:25
And more question then, have you paid using your own wallet not related to any Bitcoin valley software?
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:26:57
Their Monopoly to force people to work
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:16:46
yes, if you want to get a 5k payment via LN channel, then   
1. channel must be opened to you  (not specifically with your payer)   
2. channel should have 5k liquidity on your counter part in channel.  
LN is not intended to serve one time payments. You open channel with LN Node and use it to pay somebody. On this step liquidity is shifting to your counter party side When you get paid , your channel liquidity shifting to your side. It's like shifting money from one side to another side of channel when you pay or get paid.   
But if you want to get paid in amount more than you have in your channel on your counter party side , then it's not possible to use existing channel.

Main point for inflation is that people spend more. They do not spend more because of inflation, they spend more because they are forced to spend. It's not freedom. Having no instrument to save money for retirement forcing not rich to work until death. Once poor have option to save wealth in time, they will not die at work. They will have more freedom. Inflation is slave system.

Internal transfers between local bitcoins accounts is possible. And it's off chain and it's zero fee. Main thing  it's custody. And you have to trust them if you want to use them. It's not decentralized.

@_date: 2018-08-05 19:56:08


Partially true. Some coins you can use as faster cheaper fee alternatives. But I prefer second layers. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:39:52


Sure. Price will be, everything will be decreased in price VS Bitcoin. No exceptions. It is already happening even when we have an Inflation in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-08-05 11:45:31

What's new in this version please?
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:27:39
you wrote so many words and analysis is good but never mentioned that BTC trading volume es number 1 in the list of whole market, and that BTC inflation rate is decreasing every 4 years. if you do not bear in mind two of these statements , analysis is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:31:51
bitcoin will have lots of volatility again and again. More people involved in crypto the higher the spikes. It does not depend on the market cap. You just need a mass media in a desired direction. But this wont stop me to keep buying bitcoin and adopting it in my regular life , by paying my rent in bitcoin, by buying a coffee in a cafe with lightning payments and by giving a presents to my family in bitcoin seed with zero point X amount. 
Thats the real freedom not an events or absence of events.

This is good. But why still testnet? Mainnet lightning operating already with 93 BTC total capacity
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:14:01
so it must start before first ?
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:32:29
I hope it wont repeat this time. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:48:36
the answer is "adoption"
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:18:40
You are right it can be 50k/BTC in 2028, but until you do not think about amount of electricity consumed for one block and the price of this electricity, your calculation is not good. What price in dollars 1kwh will be in 2028 ? What difficulty BTC will have at that time ? All these questions must be answered before you measure everything in dollars. Start measuring it in BTC then you will have more correct results.
@_date: 2018-08-18 09:17:28

Sorry did not tried being agressive at all. Thanks for pointing me, I will re-read my messages before posting now. Thing that I just was tried to tell is crypto as tool is very good now. Businesses will be connected to Ln and exchange. And once they get payment via Ln they will sell the same amount of BTC on the exchange. This will help to maintain the same amount on crypto and count profit in Fiat. I do not expect 1btc will be 1btc as payment asset, but as parents tool is great. As customer you also can maintain your own balance of crypto the same. You just pay with Ln to merchant and then buy the same amount of crypto on exchange. Nobody will loose abything. And all will use crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:21:02
so we can say it is even more. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:04:35
and do not forget about 3rd party. with LN there is no 3rd party for these payments. Currently it exists with custodians. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:28:37
In future nobody will trust a person who has no any transactions in bitcoin blockchain. Or at least signed by PK of the bitcoin owner. Bitcoin owners will have the power. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:13:40
The electricity consumption of bitcoin mining is just a physical link of Electronic world to Real analogous world to get Natural Concurrency to participate and support Electronic Currency  in the world.  
Real world concurrency based on money and greed. 
The best idea of 21st century. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:54:14
LN is already in mainnet. And we are already experiencing LN with real life products and services payments. If it's not enough for you. Then good luck to wait a day when you will be offered to make LN payments from your bank.

@_date: 2018-06-29 10:21:40
It's when you consider BTC as asset. Consider BTC as a tool and if you have 10 BTC in Ln and payments in BTC for 1 BTC you just lost nothing. You used Ln for getting payments not for earning Fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:43:36
this is true. But ok. let me ask more specifically if you have one channel and all balance is in remote point ? How without onchain transaction you can increase your local channel balance ?
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:00:30
SWIFT or it's analog can be based on top of lightning network.  Many countries would like to join trusted, independent and fast international money transfers. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:30:38
yes and at moment you have to open new channel when existing channel out of balance from your side. In future there will be possible to "fill in" existing channel. But actually it's even better to get paid via lightning network. So you will have funds back in your channel 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:04:32
This is cool, man. Thanks now I understand at least how much it would cost and what hashpower must be involved. I always think hashpower of top pools on bitcoin would just available to make 51&amp; double spend attack only once. then it's the end of their business. Miners wont join these pools.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:20:36
thats correct point.

@_date: 2018-06-12 17:18:20


Why do you need to afraid deflation in Bitcoin specifically ?
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:02:30
Very very bullish. Much more people now got on board in crypto and these people still believe in BTC but not other currencies. As a measure of it, just compare the Fiat value of Bitcoin network transfers. It's still 30x higher than before halvening. So BTC serves now much more people as international money transferring system than ever before.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:56:32
and then this event also push the price up , and this is what the reason you buy BTC to expect price goes up =)
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:47:49
It does not look like channel rebalancing. It's just you can do lightning payment via User defined routing. This feature gives users more control, but most of payments intended to rely on lnd the cheapest route for your payments. Does not look like you can rebalance the channel with this api endpoint. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:59:08
finally got it. Yes. Thought that if you have two channels you can issue invoice to be paid from one channel to another, but it's only possible with this new command . thanks. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:27:31


it's even hard to imaging all cases where bitcoin will be used. no only money but as immutable ledger. Imaging your grandchildren will use your private key to keep running your business you will start in next decade. Global business, with no borders and no limitations of governments.

Recently in a video from BIOT = automated parking payments per minute while car is on the parking spot. 
Electricity already mentioned, it may include all your flat bills not only electricity.
Payments on the public transport. We remove banks and selling points. Train will charge you when you get in and go out from it. 
Also BIOT mentioned the bar where you pay for drinks poured. 
And seems the world will be so commercialised with this LN , everything where the money can be charged but banks were expensive or physical person was needed to charge you will be charged automatically.

I hope it will be a concurrency between nodes to route your payments towards your payee. And this concurrency will keep prices low.   
I.e. you have a 50 $ payment.  At the moment there are few nodes connected to each other with this liquidity and only them available to route your payment to payee.  
But when price of BTC rizes, more and more nodes become available to pass your payment, because their channels are in BTC and higher BTC price made their channels capable to route your 50$ payment.

It's much more complex topic to just say hashrate is now 20% of current. You have to get few ideas how it could happen first. It's interesting to speculate though. It could be war in China. Could be electricity production crisis, a bug in mining hardware or vulnerability. But 2 weeks period for adjusting difficulty could be enough to redistribute hashing power by competitive players.

Mining proof of work keep out malicious persons to spent their Bitcoin twice. When somebody can gain 51% of hashing power then there are able to spend the money twice to buy something. But this thing must be very expensive, as controlling so much hashing power is fucking expensive. That's what miners could do in a very very specific conditions. They won't change inflation rate
