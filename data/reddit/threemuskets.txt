Yes, the best part about VanityGen is you can generate addresses with words in them :)    (You don't have to though)
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:32:50
You could use VanityGen. I've used it before, works fairly well.

What an idiot... If you don't understand something DONT FREAKING PRETEND YOU DO
@_date: 2016-10-09 16:58:00
Wouldn't be surprised if it was a scam

My support pledged to you my friend 
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:43:51
Don't believe me? See for your self! ALL of the deals listed redirect you to a fake site! Ex: Bitmain-tech.com rather than bitmaintech.com, sqondoolietech.com instead of spondollietech.com! PLEASE SAVE YOUR SELVES AND YOUR BTC! I traced the IP's of each domain and they are all coming out of Atlanta Georgia, which is not where these real sites are hosted. PLEASE UPVOTE AND SHARE SO WE CAN WARN PEOPLE ABOUT THIS SCAM!
