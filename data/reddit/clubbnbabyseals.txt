it's worked out very well for me thus far. I've found that exercising patience can be the most challenging aspect of day trading. but when you have a solid belief in the function of the coin and the team behind the project etc, it helps you get through the daily/weekly dips. i have positions in coins that i firmly believe in and know they have an awesome future, and then i also hold positions in some shit coins that i know i can make some Satoshi off of day to day or week to week.

The Intel chip issue can affect everything, with the exception of cold storage harware wallets. Any wallet on your PC/laptop is therefore vulnerable due to the CPU kernel issue. Patch your OS as soon as an update is made available.

*• What Are The Minimum System Requirements? Most people can run a full node as the requirements are very basic! The Bitcoin.org website suggests that you have 145 GB of Storage, running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux, 2 GB of RAM, broadband with at least 50 Kilobytes per second, an un-metered connection and 6 hours of up-time per day!*
running a headless daemon does not require 2G of RAM. i'm setting up a full node on a Raspberry Pi 3, which only has 1G RAM. no issues thus far.

bitfinex is run by CEO Jan Ludovicus van der Velde (whom is also chief executive at Tether), Chief Strategy Officer Phil Potter and Chief Financial Officer Giancarlo Devasini. speculation was recently confirmed by documents contained in the leaked Paradise Papers, which showed that Potter was a director and Devanisi a shareholder of Tether as well.

uhg congratulations man! it's insane isn't it? like I read this and its truly heartwarming. you have the power to do anything and everything now; I pray that i too can reach this height in time. I've been holding BTC for awhile, but I wouldn't consider myself an early adaptor. My end goal, besides the obvious moon/lambo, is to help create a decentralized, locally owned internet infrastructure that ultimately ends dependency on big telecom and their capitalistic agenda.

I got it. I think I'm confused because I had a phone that broke and I got the replacement phone and then did the smart switch to transfer all my apps and data, including the Authenticator. at that time, I only had Coinbase on the 2fa authenticator, and it transferred over with Coinbase still on it. so it wasn't my Google account tied to both phones that allowed the successful transfer, it was the smart switch. so in the instance in which my phone is 100% broke or stolen, I won't be able to get back into my Authenticator unless I have it backed up on a second phone?

how so? because you live in Europe, shouldn't it be easier for you than say someone living in America? if Coinbase is the only broker you're using with a bank account, I could see how that may lead to issues. so why not  just join another exchange with a USD/€ wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:08:24
essentially the people who control the "printing" of tether (Bitfinix) are able to buy/prop up as much Bitcoin as they want with their worthless tether while stealing the USD injected by everyone else. there have been zero legitimate audits performed by anyone outside of Bitfinex to my knowledge.

yeah money can be made via day trading but I wouldn't suggest starting off with that. start buying up small amounts of Bitcoin and just sit on it. if you have the time and patience, educate yourself on some altcoins and their trends. when you feel your ready, grab yourself some Ethereum or Litecoin for trading and have at it. this should go without saying, but never invest more than your willing to lose.

Usually boils down to Exodus, Jaxx or Electrum. Recently there have been some troubles with security of Jaxx, more or less real, more or less rumours, anyway that has brought doubts about it. And it's not open-source (if to consider this as less trustworthy in blockchain community).
On the other hand, Exodus is a newcomer and info about it looks mostly kind of sponsored, not yet many feedbacks from real users of Exodus. Although it intensively develops and gains recognition in blockchain community. It's not fully open-source but founder can make it that way in future, he mentioned about six months ago.
So, till nowadays Electrum looks the most trustworthy desktop wallet in blockchain community, compared to the above mentioned. It's open-source, it has even portable version for Windows, and version for Linux, and version for Android. Yet it is only for bitcoin till today. We may just hope, who knows, maybe they will add some more cryptocoins into it sooner or later…
Also they say there is another analogue of Electrum in all meanings, indeed more user-friendly for a newbie and more flexible and feature-rich. That is also well and long known software wallet Copay. And it is оnly for bitcoin too, and also there are no any talks if it can support some altcoins in future...

"Most people flock toward the most common exchanges, because bigger exchanges are easier to trade in. Lets pretend the larger exchange is Bitstamp. The price of a bitcoin on Bitstamp will increase due to the surge of buyers. Meanwhile, at Binance, there is less volume and the market is slower to react to change. For about an hour, the price of bitcoin on Bitstamp is going to be more than Binance. So, at 10:00AM, you could buy a bitcoin on Binance for $101 and sell that same bitcoin on Bitstamp for $105, making $4.50. This is what arbitrage is, and it really can be a fool-proof method of investment if you understand and manage the complexities of this situation, such as the delay with blockchain confirmation..."

it's just wreckless investing. you could wake up tomorrow and btc is at 6K. you took a gamble, and won. don't forget the number one rule in gambling -  the house always wins. play long enough, you never change the stakes. the house takes you. unless, when that perfect hand comes along, you bet big, then you take the house.

I've had nothing but a positive experience with Binance for awhile now. their fees are low, transaction speed has always been reasonable for me. I have a rewards code if you decide to join up
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:06:36
it would be easier if you just sent them to me. I will send you a personal check.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:40:30
it isn't difficult to fabricate a "factory seal". say a malicious "fourth party" employee working for the authorized third party company devised a way to hack outgoing ledgers...one could argue that you run the same risk even when ordering from the company itself but my bottom line - i don't trust middlemen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:47
do it. put 2k in

it's gonna be SUPER loud in there. any reasonable set up that's gonna net you anything worthwhile is gonna be pretty loud and annoying. consider cloud mining...

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:21
indeed. I've researched the last few days and out of the top 3 - ledger nano s, trezor and keepkey, nano s was my final decision. ordering from Amazon and fully aware that if the box is not sealed when it lands in my hands, I will return and get another one until I'm satisfied it hasn't been tampered with in any way.

I believe if you send your coin from Coinbase to GDAX, and then send from GDAX to your hW wallet, the fees are very small.

you have to use Coinbases exchange GDAX....no transfer fees. theyre the same company so it's very simple to move your funds to GDAX from Coinbase before sending them anywhere else.

do your own research. share your findings.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:13:03
be sure however to check your ledger transaction speed settings. I believe the default is 'high' which will result in higher fee when transferring from the Ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:59:28
yea why is that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:36:46
working just fine for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:50:07
AHH yes, if only I was paying closer attention. my apologies, heart rate a bit high...anyways perhaps google "where to purchase Bitcoin as a minor?" I've only used coinbase thus far, coinbase and changelly.

withdraw from coinbase to gdax. no fee. send from gdax to anywhere for free. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:31
feel the same. when the price tanks its not fun to see your portfolio go down; but when you're slowly accumulating its not nearly as gut wrenching as investing $20k+ all at once and watching it dwindle to $5k.
