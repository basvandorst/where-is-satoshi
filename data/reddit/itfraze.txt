I think an average person needs 2-3 mm to retire with current dividend payments on the broad market.

pretty sure etfs will have to hold x bitcoin per share, which they have stockpiled, when more people buy in eventually they have to hit that level of holdings (this is how gold works I think).  either way it will go up

canadian, i use kraken and have had multiple $10000+ withdrawals and deposits into RBC with no issues.
The withdrawals can take longer then they estimate, but banks will be banks.

True, i'm more basing it off an extra conservative 3% dividends from blue chips not counting any stock growth.
The amount needed to retire depends on so many factors its hard to generalize.  Anyone should be able to retire if they have ~$60k a year from dividends (okay, not everyone, some places are expensive + kids)

sheets is suitable for most use cases, especially personal, but it is terrible compared to excel. (i use both, sheets for anything simple, excel basically for anything with pivots)

I'm sure they know the names of wires corresponding to BTC, but my accounts have a lot of large transactions in and out (especially usd visa I use for business) so they might not look as much into it.
I definitely have never had issues.

I tell everyone who asks how to buy bitcoin to just go to quickbt for a small transaction. Always worked flawlessly.
