Most DRM comes down to a True/False statement in the code somewhere: "Is this licensed?". So the majority of cracks simply patch the code branch that checks to always return True. Doesn't matter what kind of checking it's doing, even the root-kit known as SecurROM was cracked.

You're assuming that the loss of BTC was due to an outside actor. It's equally likely that it was due to insider fraud or theft. By having running audits it ensures for both the companies and their clients that they can make good on deposits when it comes time to withdraw. It would solve the same problem that the FDIC insurance covers, loss to clients due to company negligence or disaster.

YAY! I'll give the game a shot. I see that you've already added instructions to the site for bitcoin purchases. It strikes me that a bitcoin shopping cart module might help more people implement it.
@_date: 2011-06-12 03:15:49
Yeah, checked that out. Towards the bottom it starts being less of a dipshit contest.
A good point was made, a gem really, that it looks more like market manipulation and a big sell off.
The timing of the weekend; when there is a generally lower volume made it easier. Banks are closed; people are therefor slower to react in buying without being able to pump money in, therefor resort to selling in order to cut losses.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:50:51
Yeah. Someone found that back when the crash happened. Best theory was that it was MtGox or Deepbit consolidating accounts. Now with LulzSec taking an interest...I don't know. I think they would crash the market just so that they could say they did. Heck, a lot of people would get rich quick once the market recovered. Heck THEY would make a metric ass-load.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:27:54
What people haven't grokked yet is that BitCoin is cash. No different than the cash in your pocket. Just as if you lose a fiver on the bus you can lose a BTC just as easily if you're not careful.
That having been said, the FDIC (in the US) insures deposits to banks and financial institutions up to a certain amount in the event that something like this happens. This is in essence a bank heist. With a side of identity theft thrown in for good measure.
Banks protect against this by enforcing things like two-factor authentication, end to end encryption and sanitizing their DB inputs....except [Citibank]( MtGox was using SSL (https protocol) which is good. From what I've seen of their API they were sending the username and password un-encrypted as part of the URL via the POST method. This means that for a man-in-the-middle attack the attacker only needed the URL string and nothing else. I recon that's how the attackers got access. Poison the DNS, grab the URL and hope it's an admin.
So, what should be done in the future to better secure the site? Two factor authentication, salting and hashing the password before sending and using the GET method so that the URL doesn't contain the data in the request.

Sure, i'll need a new set soon. Although this might go better over in r/BitMarket

Very nice. I would like to see more. Perhaps open source it?
@_date: 2011-06-14 00:29:08
The difference because the graph shows the data for the last period(low,open,close,high) and the mtgox page shows the lowest open ask order.
@_date: 2011-05-19 01:46:58
Seconded. I'm running two 5670s for about 155 Mhash/s. Then again, that's peanuts compared to what a 5970 can do.

Torrents have not been outlawed for the same reason that they can't outlaw bit coin. It's a tool. More people buy drugs with cash than with bit coin.

I'll try and post a diff later.
[VirusTotal]( already has it in their db.
@_date: 2011-05-23 21:40:47
Yeah, but consider this: 1,000,000 computers times just 1 MHash/s equals 1 THash/s. So a not inconsiderable amount. There would be massive bank for a short period of time and then the difficult would get too high again. I think that this is perhaps one way in which the BitCoin network is vulnerable.

No, I guess I misunderstood how ssl urls are handles. And yes, I meant reckon. :)

No. The throughput of mining is below even the 1x bandwidth limit. Since 99% of the mining takes place in ram on the gpu very very very little actually needs to go back and forth between the cpu and gpu.

It's good to see BitCoin getting press, but the article paints a bleak picture. The author asserts that either it will fail to gain critical traction, will be inherently unstable,  or that "unsavory" types of people will use it to their own ends (gambling, drugs, smugglers, etc.). It should be noted that the things that the author claims are possible with this one are possible with any currency, even regulated and tracked ones. What the author doesn't say is that unlike other currencies, this one cannot be counterfeited (prove me wrong).
PS: Yeah, I drank the cool-aid. But then again, I'm also an eternal optimist.

Banks pay interest on deposited money because they put that money to work in the form of loans which they receive interest on. Will you be doing something similar such as loans or investments?

By default on windows the folder which contains the wallet.dat is in appdata or application data under the current user's profile. It's not in the bitcoin program folder.
You can change what folder it saves data to using a command line switch. I copied the data folder into my bitcoin folder and use a batch file to launch it. In this way I can then sync that to my online backup or my flash drive.

Not really. Silk Road is obviously illegal. BitCoin is an oddity to most people still and so it bears mentioning that the site found an anonymous payment method which is digital. Cash is also anonymous.

Devs do similar things when pricing in other foreign currencies. Have you ever bought Minecraft? it's priced in euros. I used paypal to buy it which calculated at the current exchange the value in USD which I then paid. Same deal.

Firstly, I'm pretty sure that US law doesn't apply in Japan. Secondly the US can and has taken websites offline by seizing their domain name. The downside to that is that as the Wikileaks thing was going down last year there were alternate DNS paths to the Wikileaks website. There is at least one BTC exchange in the US, at least one in Japan, at least one in the UK, at least one in Canadia. And since US law doesn't really apply anywhere else unless they also have the same law. We'll find a new market and trade there when and if it comes to that.
Also, ThePirateBay was indicted into the ground, but somehow it still seems to be operating. Hmmm, odd. ;)
P.P.S. there's always TOR.

Right now the rubric for BTC value is other currencies. This will change as more people actually spend instead of mining and speculating.

As we all know, that doesn't mean that it is their only address.
@_date: 2011-06-12 01:11:32
So let me pose a hypothesis. Lulzsec found a 0-day in the BTC network. They troll for donations. That gives them a good sized list of addresses. If they found a way to spoof or coerce an address to send BTC that could explain the 250+ addresses sending 50 BTC each to one address. Or even worse, they found an error in the implementation of the hashes and found a way to access arbitrary addresses.

@_date: 2011-05-24 15:15:00
there are a number of sites which price things dynamically based on the current valuation of the BTC. I don't see why This would be any different. The value of the BTC varying versus PayPal or Google Checkout just locking you out of your funds is just a risk assessment trade off. Besides, with more bitcoins flowing through the market the value will increase, making it a decent bet.
EDIT: P.S. the value of BTC has had a very strong upward movement and since topping out around 8.5 it has stabilized at around 7. See [BitCoin Charts]( for research materials.
@_date: 2011-09-16 17:03:03
I think that there are a couple of valid points in this thread. One of them relating to mining intrigues me. I'd be interested in statistics regarding miner operation size. For instance, a miner has to sell x percent of their BTC take in order to pay ongoing expenses or recoup initial investment. What percentage of mining goes towards those expenses and thus into the economy immediately and what is then left and hoarded?
EDIT: spelling.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:28:56
Why under the "Security" heading do Google Wallet and Paypal have the qualifications that the respective company gets your card info, but not Apple Pay or Samsung Pay? It seems disingenuous because in the latter cases those companies also get your card info. At some point in all of those schemes someone has to process the actual payment against the card, therefor in all cases some company gets your card info.
