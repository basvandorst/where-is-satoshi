There was a bit of irony in the answer from u/HauntingGeologist :)

Some great answers already in this thread, but I try to phrase my understanding as well, and adding a thought on the fee estimations ;
As mentioned by others the fee estimations fluctuate up and down and you still have your satoshis available, but LND lets you know what you can expect to pay if you'd like to close your channel as of right now. 
To me, this fee estimation that is provided seems way too high, I just tried myself to open a channel by choosing sats per byte = 3, and this got confirmed within half an hour. LND would have had me pay 10 times that sum if I would have simply chosen "Channel" in the Raspiblitz SSH interface. 
So make sure to find the LND commands and instruct opening and closing of channels yourself through the command line, or perhaps use the RTL web-GUI which I havent tried myself yet. 
I also used the standard Raspiblitz GUI for opening my first 10 channels and paid roughly 10 000 sats per channel before realizing that I could pay 10% of that by setting the fees myself - as long as I dont mind to wait a little bit before the channel is opened. This is an important realization especially if you would like to run a routing node..
I used this command in the commandline in order to open my cheap channel (through Raspiblitz GUI just choose 'X' to reach the command line ;
lncli openchannel --node\_key \[**Insert public key here of a node that you have already connected to as a peer\]** \--local\_amt 250000 --sat\_per\_byte 3
Hope that this added some nugget of useful information to this slightly confusing topic..
