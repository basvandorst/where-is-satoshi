Soo let's just believe some random guy that says he has a friend at Coinbase? Good, let me go invest thousands now.

So when is it coming out? Is there any ETA? I'm genuinely curious.

A lot of people are expecting a crash. If my memory is correct, most BTC was taken off Coinbase prior to the fork (over 60/70%?). The price will come down a bit, but not like some people are expecting it to. Xapo has been dumping thousands of BCH since the fork and the price has been stable. And if Coinbase actually confirms the buying and selling of BCH, I expect the price to rise OR to at least remain where it's been. But a crash? Nah.

I don't understand why it is acceptable to bash Bitcoin Cash in this sub. However if you post something in favor of it, it is immediately deleted and sometimes bans are handed out. So why are posts like this allowed then? If this sub is strictly for Bitcoin tech talk, not other "altcoins", why is stuff like this allowed? I'm not picking sides so don't crucify me. But seriously, all posts like this should stop.

Japanese dub was so much better than the English one.

On a serious note, we're not out of the woods yet. I firmly believe one more correction is in order before we start a solid bullish reversal.

Take everything you read with a grain of salt - that goes for both subs.
