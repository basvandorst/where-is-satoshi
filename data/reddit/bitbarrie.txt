Just came back from the Toronto Conference......Segwit and LNetwork as presented looks like a pile of steaming trouble..Way too complex, unexplainable to the audience and so complicated that the next super genius out there is just salivating  for the release.  You thought the DAO had problems.  Best of luck.

The room full of disbelieving devs and the lack of confidence in the system that I witnessed doesn't support your view in my eyes. But hey you own bitcoin so what do I know? Best of luck.

Sure...it is all new. the business guys were in shock because they don't understand the lingo let alone the science and were told to get up to speed or they would lose their jobs basically. My take on the whole message on LN and SW was "we hope it will work, it is complicated and could be more elegant but this is what we have"
I wasn't infused with confidence
