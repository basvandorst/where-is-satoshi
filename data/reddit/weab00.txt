Even if you had held onto them, you most definitely would've sold them when it reached $100. If not then, then at the dip in 2013. The only people that are millionaires from buying BTC $1 a piece are those who have have had full faith in cryptocurrency and privacy since day one, and those who bought some and then forgot about it for 3 to 4 years.

They're urging the person to help out given the current state of bitcoin.

I use Gemini.

You have to upload a driver's license/ID to do any actual trading though.

They're considered to be the best by many because of their sleek website/app interface and user-friendliness (especially with people new to the crypto market). Coinbase knows this and uses it to charge outrageous fees (4% for a credit card, 1.5% with a bank account). Because of their extreme popularity, they often experience frames of time where no one can buy, sell, or trade at all. This combined with their horrible customer service, and long waiting times for transactions to complete has lead many to hate them. Coinbase's own convenience was its downfall.

How does it work?

@_date: 2017-12-27 06:32:36
Out of the loop. What did he do?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:13:15
Well he asked how it was relevant
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:46:57
[This]( works.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:50:12
I think he's saying how much we need Lightning and giving slow transaction speeds and high fees as examples.

I ate too many last year and had a huge sugar crash. Haven't been able to come back from it
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:35:06
You should call them BitCons

Not gonna work
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:08:47
It worked
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:09:11
It ultimately worked
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:25:31
That’s a dumb mindset. If you see an opportunity, take it.
@_date: 2019-06-13 05:27:23
That's not even worth it, even 8% isn't worth it. Just buy it online.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:24:23
They approved my passport even though I’m a minor
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:55:39
I asked if there was any way they could refund me
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:16:15
Fuck I can’t afford to lose that much money.

Why is it "not a big deal" when it's down a ton, but all of a sudden it's on a huge upward curve when it goes up?
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:06:04
No, the entire point of the mindset is to ignore market trends and hold BTC based a false notion that they'll become rich off of it one day. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:51:07
I need the ID to get the bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-09 16:26:12
The entire "HODL" mindset
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:55
There weren't any brains behind his decision. It paid off big time, but he could've just as easily lost his entire gamble.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:43:26
Sunk cost fallacy

Yet you're saying it like it it's comforting to everyone, as opposed to a select minority. It's better for you, but honestly not for most of us (Most people that subbed in the past year). Either way, its still a major bubble pop/stabilization.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:54:43
Doesn't comfort many people considering most of the people on this sub came after the boom.
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:17:33
It was $140k for like a day
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:21:13
How does it work, where do I access my wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:42:03
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:55:11
I mean, hindsight is 20/20 tbf
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:43:06
Same here, but $100 at 18.5k to see what would happen. Not a huge loss on my part ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Something something past results future performance
