I have been asked to put some buddy's money on a falling btc price (at 19k) and declined. "You have no clue what what you are doing. It could easily continue to rise... and what then? I don't support reckless gambling." 
He was really obset and thought it is a nobrainer, but wouldn't do it himself (lack of skills). Yesterday i told him finally, that his profits were limited, but losses (when price rises) are unlimited. He did not know that. 
Instead in my case i can only lose what i have invested (speculated), but the gains are practically unlimited (kinda). 
Additionally i have to pay fees per day and taxes and i am in the uncomfortable position to owe him money. 
End of story: proper Financial Education is rare, but greed is everywhere. We will see this next year on a much broader scale (sad.)

According to data from Earn.com which talks of the recommended fee is 8 satoshis per byte, which is roughly 75 cents for a transaction worth $90,000. This means that traditional fiat transactions can be up to 6000 times costlier than a Bitcoin transaction!
OMG. Brilliant investigation.
For those who don't know what i mean: the fees in  a bitcoin transaction are not related to the amount transacted.
It makes no sense to compare it on the amount to fiat transactions.

Some have to declare their holdings annually. Mostly on dec 31.
-bonds: blah (+2%)
-stocks: blah (+15%)
-cash: blah (+300%)
I think the average joe (who let his financial advisor do the financial stuff for him) would not be very happy to see a section "cryptocurrencies" in his annually overview. (news, fud, etc.). The fin advisors are aware of that and do "window dressing" at the end of the year.
Frankly speaking, it wouldn't surprise me if the cash money flows back again right after the streets are cleaned tomorrow.

No you don't think it wrong. Exactly that re-spending to other outputs is desired with full RBF. 
But the spamming possibility doesn't count. That's aready possible with non RBF transactions. 
I think duplicate RBF trx with the same sequence number will be rejected / ignored just like todays trx (first seen save)

@_date: 2015-12-02 06:38:43
With (opt-in) "Full"-RBF as merged into core you can replace the first transaction with another (which may adresses other outputs).
The fee is just the difference between the output(s) and the input(s). 
Therefore only the inputs could be the same (when thinking of amounts), the amount of the sum of the outputs will be different. 
Please educate yourself what a transaction contains. In bitcoin you don't send from an "amount". You send from inputs (former unspent trx outputs) to (newly defined) outputs. 
Edit (Correction): as i think deeper,  it also should be possible to even let the outputs the same when you add another input to the new transaction (only for the purpose of raising the fee) - but that wasn't your question.

Do not put all your assets in one pocket! Deversity is the key! So you can easily withstand a crisis in one or two of your selected asset classes.

Got into Bitcoin in early 2013 and thought i could make money through buying at one exchange and sell on mtgox. First tried with small amounts, then with larger. 
I didn't hear the warning signals - or wouldn't hear it. Thought mtgox was too big to fail and all will be fine. 
Deposited another 4digit-high eur amount even in late jan '14. 
Fortunately i withdrew a bit of every trade to cold storage, so i got some coins left, but the mayority that time got stuck there. 
Instead of selling my goxcoins to this shady quick established service as the withdrawals stopped, i bought cheap goxcoins with my euros left around the $150's/(G)BTC.
Afterwards i feel i deserved it because i was so greedy and blind. 
Now i have more real BTC as ever before at Gox times - hardware secured, got a nice stash of shiny precious metal coins and the most important: Knowledge through various books, educational videos and interest in economics. 
I can withstand the will to risk my coins through leverage and buy steadily a fixed eur amount every week. 
I set up a maximum percentage rule for investings and hope i get a fifth of my goxcoins back in 2016 - would be fine because i got them in the late  for a good discount :)

Da dies ein beliebtes Zahlungsmittel ist, wird dies selbstverständlich in Betracht gezogen. 
In Österreich, der Schweiz und den Niederlanden ist dies auch noch weiterhin möglich. Jedoch durch die Umstellung in Deutschland auf das System von Lieferando nicht mehr.

The card doesn't reveal your keys. And transactions can only be signed with the additional code-card and your phone.

The claiming process was quite straightforward. Logged in with old mtgox login data, have to change password and set up 2FA.
Next step, input the mtgox Registration Data again and update postal adress.
The claim amounts were initially provided by the "System". Inclusive interest and bch. 
Got 6% interest on my cash claims since 2014 - nice. Not on btc/bch obviously.
But i couldn't log on with my mtgox username anymore after that. One has to use the new email adress provided in the rehabilitation claiming process.

Possible when there are many of them: Tragedy of the commons.

Why should they stop mining? The majority of the mining income will be fees for decades - not the per-block reward.

The price is rising and when i sell coins and receive a higher price i may have to pay capital gains tax on the surplus. 
The problem is the horrible manual tracking of bought and sold coins (e.g. through p2p trades). 
An app with an option to import xpub keys to automatically keep track of transactions would be a good start. Maybe with a function to mark (exclude) coins sent to an exchange/actual purchases. 
Import-functions for raw transaction data of exchanges would be a good thing, too.

This is your 2nd factor for the authentication of transactions. 
To publish a transaction, you will be prompted to type in the corresponding hexadecimal character from the security card. 
So your coins are secure even if you lose your ledger nano.

My guess is that this behavior is in favor of the faucet provider.
The main goal is in my view, to let the customer stay on their pages as long as possible. A common way is to delay payouts (e.g. on poker sites)

If you want to "cash out" and not want to hold a year, there's a catch no one tells you.
Just buy gold or something else stable directly with your btc and sell it right after.
You only have to pay the difference between the buy and sell price. Seriously less than 42%

Blocks are aggregates of transactions. The hash of a block must begin with a predifined number of zeros. To find a constellation of transactions (and other data) with a hash that special is very hard so only one in 10min can be found. Each new block is bound to a private key (just a long number never seen before). You can calculate the address from that priv key but not vice versa.

Yes. Imagine locked ballot boxes as the adresses and the transaction as your polling paper. Once stuck in a ballot box (sent to an address)  you need the key (the private one). 
Your wallet software manages these keys (to addresses you own)  normally. You only have to deal with a master key as a password or a passphrase.

You can start with the amazing videos of james d'angelo: Bitcoin 101 - What is Bitcoin?: 
This was also my startingpoint. He's doing a great job. 
Read the Wikipedia page and maybe some articles referenced there. 
Search for Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube and listen. 
Try Mycelium when you're on android or breadwallet for iphone. Electrum i recommend for windows systems.

You don't invest in bitcoin when you buy them. You speculate. 
Investment is all about supporting the production of products and services and getting a direct revenue thru e. g. dividends. 
So say you want your favorite company to succeed, you give them your money by buying their stocks or bonds and they use this money to sell more products and services. You profit thru higher stock price / dividend / interest. 
Buying Bitcoin doesn't help your favorite bitcoin company. It only rises the price of the token. 
When you want to see Bitcoin suceed, support Companies that support Bitcoin by buying their Products and services!

Ok. And where's the problem then when it's opt-in? 
Wallets for allday-use like mycelium don't need to set the flag by default / might not offer this option anyway. 
On the other hand i won't use armory to buy a burger or unlock an article. 
Sure, POS-Systems and all wallet software have to adapt. 
I don't see a problem even with full-RBF, when wallets / POS-Systems act accordingly. 
IMHO the 0-conf movement nowadays lose sight of the basic concept / a basic rule: a transaction is cemented only when it's in a block. 
I myself love to settle and end a quick trade/purchase with 0-conf and sufficient confidence. That's still possible with opt-in full RBF afaik. 
AND we have a new feature available which leads us to other improvements. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 17:06:20
Opt-IN RBF is not mandatory. Your wallet software may not set this feature default. 
Anyway, the merchant's POS-System / The receivers wallet software should notice when a RBF-flagged transaction is broadcasted - the merchant then simply waits until confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 12:07:45
Will it be possible to RBF a transaction (obviously with RBF-flag)  with a transaction without a RBF-flag? 
So a merchant could say: "Please resend (replace) it without that RBF-option so you can get your coffee in about 10s (statistically high enough confidence). Otherwise you have to wait until confirmation."
