why does anyone watch what clown who runs Infowars. He's a lying, idiot buffoon.

he's got more information out to the public than me, yes. Is it right and credible? I don't have my head up my ass, so I can see that it's neither right nor credible. If you think that I'm derailing, why even respond. You're perpetuating the conversation. So sorry that you actually waste your time thinking or even looking at that idiot Alex Jones.

Of course they're worth something. But if I understand it, it's not about the PC as much as retrieving the private key (which may be stored on your PC).

I'm not angry or hateful. Look who's talking, the moderator of the conspiracy (delusional) chat!! HAHA.

Fair enough, we have different views. Can you give me an example of a fake news story from "trusted" news? Do you believe that the govt is creating gay people, that the Indian Ocean tsunami was manmade, that fluoride is actually harmful (it's not). Sorry, Jones is a carnival barker whose sales pitch is giving people a (false) sense that he (and consequently his viewers) can understand the world  in a way no one else does. He's watched now, in a moment where globalization and capitalism have rapidly (and shockingly) transformed the world, because people are looking for some sort of insight or handhold in an increasingly complex society. Somehow the fact that all of what he says is drivel seems to be lost on his audiences.. I'm not saying that NY Times and Wash Post are perfect, but they are a far sight more thorough and rational.

Noob question here: if one had BTC in a wallet like Jaxx -- does one need to do anything to get the Bitcoin cash?

ok cheers. Rather humorously, I don't own any BTC yet.... but just trying to understand what is happening.

I did watch it. I'm sorry that McAfee was attacked, but this entire site is absolute trash that repackages conspiracy theories ("they" are out to get us) in terms of a false sense of American exceptionalism/absurd libertarianism. The following site is part comedy/parody but it pretty accurately captures how silly this Alex Jones person is -- see the list of stupid claims he makes:
