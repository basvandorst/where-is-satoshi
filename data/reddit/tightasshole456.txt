My asshole is tight, precisely *because* of my sexual habits. Most  gay homosexuals are kinda loose (as a result of receptive anal penetration).
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:31:15


Maybe you should step down, so that smarter people can lead the foundation.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:27:51
must be leaking again...
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:43:15


Ooooh... what fancy grammar, silly sir!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:44:34


FTFY, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:35:17


My mind immediately supplied the ending "you're just an asshole"... Too much time on reddit.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:18:19


So, what else is new? We always knew gay homosexuality was prevalent on reddit, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:36:31
I completely agree with you, silly sir. There's no reason to be shy about offending that idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:54:45
So you chose to partake in receptive anal (gay homosexual) intercourse, going against your own (straight heterosexual) orientation, silly sir?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:07:34
Making up some random name for this dude would actually be courteous...
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:43:26
You spelling skills gave me an ulcer, silly sir.

Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen (and other Jews).
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:35:53
Does he penetrate your orifices often, silly sir?
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:36:41
That's okay, OP's comment wasn't exactly too smart either, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:50:44
TIL losing money is a virtue, and it lends credibility to one's claims.
Also, TIL it is inherently wrong to disagree with "one of BTC's greatest proponents".
I suggest you look up the meaning of the word 'cult' in any online dictionary, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:41:22


Could you elaborate on that? It's difficult to understand the precise nature of your problem.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:04:42
TIL P=/=NP is a "law of the universe".
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:41:10
I don't think you understand. You are probably somewhere on the spectrum, but I am *completely* straight! You genitals (and rectum) hold *no* interest in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:49:51


FTFY, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:37:20


THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN HIS GIGANTIC GUT!
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:01:14
I, too, am attracted to Marissa Mayer.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:51:47
How about "an idiot investor"?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:32:37


What word would you use to describe a person who trusts idiots with his money?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:05:54
Did you enjoy the experiment, silly sir? How was the sensation of having a penis in your (now loose) asshole?
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:43:09
has, IMO, poor communication skills himself. I propose we remove him from heading the movement to remove Karpeles!
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:33:21
Are you seriously suggesting we even *want* people like Mark Karpeles to contribute?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:55:41
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:51:24
If it isn't tight right now, you're probably not as straight as you claim to be, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:42:31


I hope those professionals have better grammar skills, silly sir.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:18:47
Also, 'proved' should be 'proved'.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:44:08
Yeah... that's Putin's secret motivation...
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:06:37


Would you prefer an impotent boss? Of course, I don't know whether you're male or female (or perhaps even a gay homosexual).
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:36:44


That is pretty much "the whole point of bitcoin", isn't it?
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:12:23
Actually most of reddit is probably exactly naive adolescents...
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:19:27


In a perfect world, there would be such a thing.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:58:57
Keep out of this.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:58:21
Plot twist - Winklevii are secretly closeted gay homosexuals.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:59:14


That's why we shouldn't trust OP's story...
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:29:00
Are you female? If not, I won't hold you, as I am *not* a gay homosexual, silly sir.
