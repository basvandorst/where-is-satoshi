While there is now some limited regulatory clarity, there is not yet clarity on how scalability will be achieved, both in terms of implementation, and the associated politics with selecting a solution.
Wallet security and user friendliness still remain concerns, however there are some interesting solutions in the pipeline.
US Marshals and AU gov are in possession of coins that will be auctioned.
Competition from Ethereum, Eris, Ripple, etc also make the future unclear.
I'm still hodling but it doesn't hurt to have a realistic perspective on things.

I agree with that Darkcoin is obviously something to look at if you are concerned with incentivizing full nodes, but the bitcoin network has advanced too far to include such a change.
Note that some type of multipath routing scheme is going to be included to address the potential for DoS attacks against masternodes.

I disagree with the statement "trying to take a chunk out of what Bitcoin is".
Stellar is intended for efficient exchange of currencies, one of which is bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not a currency exchange.  The Stellar currency unit in no way intends to replace the bitcoin unit as a store of value.

Good work there, and good luck in your efforts to get your money back.
I myself am currently trying to recover funds from a scammer edit: link to my investigation/evidence removed.  
I was wondering if you have done a traceroute on the IP address?  Even if the hacker was on a dynamic IP that will reveal his service provider and location.  ISPs will generally keep a log of IP addresses, identities and times for a few years at least.
"Fortunately" for you the size of the theft exceeds the threshold required for interpol to get involved (8k), and you would normally contact federal police in your jurisdiction to get things started.

Sounds exactly the same as the bitstamp hack.  All exchanges are going to need a very tightly audited or multisig hot wallet.  Basic cold / hot wallet system is no longer sufficient, since exchange can be manipulated to drain cold wallets thru the hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:32:21
No full nodes are not currently (directly) incentivized, but yes an implementation is possible.  For instance check the darkcoin masternode implementation.
