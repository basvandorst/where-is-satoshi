By their manners and their grammar you shall know them.

Second hand 2010 MacMini. Elegant, silent, cheap and efficient. Just use the built-in screen sharing to access, no need for screen or keyboard.

No need to be sarcastic. Exponential growth is eventually asymptotic to infinity. Infinity cannot fit in a finite space.

Not quite what I was trying to say. If you swap the wallet.dat file on a fully synced bitcoin core installation it will still take an hour or so for the new wallet to be accepted. Bitcoin core says something like ‘rewinding’ during the process.

Thank goodness it’s a limited edition. The thought that anything so tasteless could exist in unlimited numbers is disturbing.

A second hand 2010 Mac mini, bought for peanuts, sits next to the router. No noise, no fuss, utterly reliable and looks good too.

Your wallet.dat file ‘knows’ where all your bitcoins are on the blockchain and, most importantly, stores the keys you will need to spend them. Your wallet.dat file contains the keys so you don’t need to store them separately.  
If your wallet.dat has more than zero bitcoins, you need to keep a backup. That’s all you need. 
In the event of a computer problem leaving you unable to access bitcoin core you need only put  your wallet.dat backup into another bitcoin core installation and you’ll be right back where you were.
(Swapping one wallet.dat file for another usually ties the computer up for a hour or so but, after that, you’re right back where you started.)

Anything growing  exponentially must stop eventually, the planet is finite.

Endless Quantitative Easing and negative yielding bonds will ensure stocks are safely pumped for a few years yet. When that bubble pops, make sure you have a BTC or two.

I bought a second hand 2010 Mac mini for a song. It sits under the router connected with a six inch Ethernet cable. Silent, elegant and utterly reliable. Access is via screen sharing from my MacBook. The 2010 model has room inside for two hard discs so will never run out of space.

Sorry, I don’t have an answer for you, but 18.1 is running on my MacMini and it only has a 375GB disc, so it must be possible.

I run a second hand 2010 Mac mini bought on eBay for $120. It sits beside the router, it runs silently and is not warm to the touch so its power usage is negligible. The 2010 model has room inside for two hard discs so it’s not going to run out of space.

It doesn’t ask on High Sierra.

Can anyone, anywhere point me to any prediction from Mr Carney that has been accurate?
