Can you wait for 8.6k first because it's pretty high chance it's gonna moon after hitting that mark

Coinbase let's you buy weekly automatically a little weekly is a good idea . I'd prefer monthly myself
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:27:13
It's nice if there is no kyc/alm I've never used a bitcoin atm coinbase is the only place I've bought bitcoin but I've shapeshifted,poloniexed and changegeleyed all costing me more than it was worth.
That anonymity is pretty valuable
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:58:39
It was too difficult to buy when BTC was $1 for me�� and $100 and then my family said it was a bad idea "it sounds like a scam " they said �� I even bought 5 of the 5gh/s usb antminers RIGHT AFTER THE BIG ONES CAME OUT. 
I should of kept those little miners. 
I'm still here though and it's still pretty amazing the crypto space , if not entertaining.

No ragrets ✌️

As in?? Less than bch ? Majority chain roll back. Yes it matters
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:05:15
Price is very important . Fees won't subsidise miners if BTC isn't worth enough and miners won't secure the network for pittance . Tx fees need to start to incentivise miners more and more and in 6 years the block reward will be halved twice . A blocksize increase is on the bitcoin roadmap . Hopefully sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:10:22
Does it need to be ? Pretty obvious what I'm getting at.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:10:22
Duuno .I don't live in venesuala . And no they are buying dash. The petro is gouvernment issued crypto right ? I wouldn't include that as adoption it's a centralised shitcoin.
And yes more and more murchants are accepting bitcoin that u don't hear about,unless your extremely interested in researching every new one constantly .
Yea tether /bitfinex is going to have an effect. 
A positive one once the dust settles in my opinion .
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:13:47
Actually that could be a long time look at mt.gox .but still didn't stop BTC going parabolic .
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:50:45
Yes. Countrys currencies are failing and people in venesuala and Egypt are increasingly  buying more and more crypto currency to spend. Not to get rich . 
I said it "should " not it "will" that's the thing with bitcoin and crypto it could go to zero next year but that's highly unlikely the space is more active than ever . 
Why wouldn't it go up if you don't mind me asking ?
Some highly reputable people have stated that Blockchain/crypto is web2.0 quite a few. Could it really be just an elobarote scam? NO!
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:52:53
It doesn't. you never make more than u spend even when the price increases .
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:44:39
Don't get worried when your funds decrease by 50% in 3 months. It's happened a few times. 
It "should go back up again" "sometime" in the future.
It's a long haul not a short ride.

Both litecoins appear to have turned their back and sarted running away
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:38:51
Bitcoin itself  is cencorship resistant . iTunes , Netflix or any other centralised crap is not.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:17:29
Spare change tho. I can't convert my spare change into bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:38:10
Like I said rounding up is NOT spending spare "change " .
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:39:23
It's on showbox. Even YouTube I believe .
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:17:51
Oh so I'm going to spend some physical cash later at a local shop . How do I lnvest the physical change that I get from the fiat that I spend?? 
Digital change or rounding up to the nearest doller or pound is not "change" it's just numbers shifting on a spread sheet and a digital transaction.  
It's pretty misleading saying invest your spare "change" . The only "change" I've ever received is PHYSICAL .

Be nice to find it's real "value " first
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:42:08
You can get paid in bitcoin for running nicehash miner with a couple of good graphics cards on your PC.  It is mining but alt coins not bitcoin  and you get paid in bitcoin for your hash rate. 
In fact nicehash does have their own bitcoin pool .
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:06:17
On the Android play store there is the bitcoin lightning wallet and it runs a full lightning node directly on your device .I've tested it funded a channel tipped the developer .it's by far the easiest way right now .I also closed the channel and received back my bitcoin it's also a bitcoin wallet (obviously )

Bottom was obvious in december tho. It traced sideways for weeks never going below 3,240 . I bought as much as I could 245£
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:48:18
I'm guessing he ment the blocks are  the same across the network in all nodes .
Hes asking how their isn't different transactions in different blocks on different nodes.

This is actually not a bad post. And the motivation video  is 50% relatable to btc . Damn downvote my first ever post. I wont bother again .

It got to 1$ .banking on bitcoin documentary , behind the bubble documentary.  What is money . Central banks. And then mining, ASICS, wtf is a hash , hashing, cryptography and then forks, forks, forks and forks. WHO IS SATOSHI

Yes the halvening
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:26:41
Blockstream broadcast blocks over satalite and you can sync the chain via the linkup ,I don't think  you can broadcast transactions tho
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:31:21
I'm not trying correlate anything I'm explaining why fees are required for a tx to be confirmed . Nothing to do with block reward .
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:07:25
Bitcoin used o hav zero to near zero fees. The mining difficulty means it's cost alot now so fees have risen. 
There are so called blockchains with near zero fees .good.luck with them .
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:13:54
When blocks get full fees rise yada yada , were not f ING talking about that tho
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:01:36
Block "reward" WAS 50 now it's 25 but blocks contain transactions and transactions can contain as many BTC as you wan to send to someone
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:08:57
Care to explain? The difficulty rose so much you have to expend so much electricity to win/find a block that you couldn't add tx's to a block with zero fees constantly . I'm pretty sure I'm right but correct me if you think I'm wrong
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:11:04
Maybe you don't realise that 0 sat/byte fee transaction were perfectly fine in 2009 /2010 untill the difficulty rose then it would cost the miner to include your tx and find the lowest value block hash
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:11:19
I don't think you know yourself do you?
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:27:48
Dont you need to plug it into a PC to use it?
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:49:16
I thought a paper wallet is more secure than a hardware wallet. There have been known bugs with them .
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:32:47
Bitfnex and tether may as well be one thing. Bitfinex print tether tokens and they are not fully backed by usd . They probably dont have everyone's BTC either. If everyone tries to withdraw from bitfinex they'll suspend withdrawals bc they dont have everyone's money . And now they cant keep printing USDT to  pay back investors  because the FBI are watching .
@_date: 2019-05-24 08:21:09
All I ment was there are people that could extract keys from hardware wallet but they would need to have 'technical expertise' I do believe a hardware wallet is most convenient and safest way to store crypto . I never claimed to be an expert myself.  And theres probably only a handful of people that could acess a hardware wallets keys in the first place.  If it's in a safety deposit box which I doubt yours is then yea, no chance  .
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:35:38
'Expert' where did I say that . 
You should work on your social skills and stop being such a prick .

Poor lazlo, probs will just link to his old reply to the original reddit,, bitcoin pizza thread. Let them repost, repost and bring up a ,significant,  event in bitcoin! More significant than you realise maybe . We are still early?

In this case I think that piece of art might be worth a small fortune in the future, unfortunately the fraction of the satoshi probably won't be worth much at all. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:54:46
Figured I'd park some in USDC and see where it goes. Why not try Gemini doller if u dont like coinbase ?

ABcore is already a thing.its on play store for early acess.  It's a pruned node (10gb) but you still have to download the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:53:15
Google play store .
ABCore . It's a full bitcoin node (pruned) . Not the same as being used here I believe tho
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:58:54
If your spending it all it doesn't matter that the key is exposed to the internet
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:53:47
Well for one I can just steal your ledger and extract the keys with technical expertise . ..but tbh I need to get my self a nano s or something.  One I've got 1000 worth of crypto on it then I'll probably also get a safe. 
I'm not knocking hardware wallets but here is an article about 4 bug on trezor devices  tl:dr
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:08:30
What about tainted coins ?. I'd call that censoring,  whatever happened to the coins . Hacked , stolen or whatever.  It's the exchanges responsibility and marking stolen coins as 'tainted 'is dumb. 
Samson quite often makes some dumb comments . He is not a speaker for bitcoin. He works for block stream which build software for btc. As far as I'm aware he doesn't even have git access to the bitcoin repo so dont listen to what he says . If you need a responsible spokesperson for bitcoin then listen to Andrea antinopolous
