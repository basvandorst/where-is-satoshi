Never used the coins that is. I mined at my job for about 6 months. Not a ton as they were pieces of shit but I am still having a hard time finding a way to get them out easily. I want to keep some of the bitcoins but I also don't want to go through this if I want to get them out later.

I'm kind of resigning myself to doing this. I could totally use the money now but you're right. I'm kicking myself I didn't hide those miners and leave em running for a few years at my last job.

Yeah misspoke. I'm just still an idiot at this, and it's honestly infuriating reading about it on Reddit because whether it's bitcoin or cash, there's so much misinformation and influencing. I entirely understand why you'd think I'm a shill.

It's honestly so frustrating trying to get back into this and learn when everything on every side is half baked conspiracy theories and shitposts. I get it, education takes a while and you have to thoroughly think through any investment but I feel like I'm wading through so much bullshit to get to any real information. Correct me if I'm wrong but it's entirely possible multiple similarly named crypto currencies can exist and thrive at the same time...

Super noob that mined some coins when bfl was around. Couldn't believe the fees I was seeing to transfer, honestly was around 30% of some I just had sitting there. Made the mistake of trying a really low fee overnight and just see the price dropping as I wait for it to confirm. Maybe I'm a special case but damn that was frustrating to figure out.

Yeah. I was super angry when it first happened(ie. felt stupid) and now I'm totally roped back in. Realizing I had free electricity and a 1080ti box always on anyway gave me a little incentive to get back into it.

Ok I get it, everyone is sensitive right now. I just want to know if I'm doing something wrong when people on here are complaining about a $5 fee and it not being percentage based when mine seems to be because I have a high transaction size.

I bought a couple cheap bfl miners back in the day and never used them. They've just been sitting there but my transaction size is making it super hard to exchange it at a decent rate. I know not much I can say to convince you, and I get it but I'm not quite grasping why it's so much bigger just because I mined them.

I literally only have the BCH I got when I started trying to cash out when this all spiked. I could care less about which currency wins other than that I'd like to get my bitcoin while it's high and need the money. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:58:45
So is there any way to reduce my fee? I just have such a high transaction size(which I know is not normal and I should have said that so people didn't just automatically think I was a shill)? I have to wait until this transaction get's released to recalculate it but at 25 Sat/byte is was about $60.

I was just letting it run for about 6 months but I believe it was probably dumping into my wallet once a day. Tactical error on my part it looks like.

I actually meant to come make a post. I made a super low transaction fee and thought I'd boned myself. It eventually just went through in time for the price to be higher than when I initially wanted to sell.
