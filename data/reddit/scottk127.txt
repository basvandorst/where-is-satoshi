Every time you use a credit card. 
Merchants don’t get paid for a month until the transactions are all settled. Bitcoin fees are high but over time will improve.

Bittrex, which has more than 3 million customers globally, is launching fiat trading on Thursday for Bitcoin, Tether and TrueUSD. The service will initially be available only to corporate customers in Washington, California, New York and Montana for regulatory reasons, but the firm said it plans to expand the offering to retail investors eventually.

Alts are relevant because when talking about bitcoin it’s a logical flow of conversation to move to also talk about them when explaining the crypto universe to someone and how it has the potential to impact how many industries in the world work today. I also never said they were all the same so the only fallacy is your comment.

When talking about alt coins I think it’s better to reference it as investments in startup companies.. those alts that have an actual use because that’s really what it is, an investment into them building something.  Those kinds of words are more familiar with people and they will understand it more likely.

Great points on staying in percentages. As far as how much i've invested, i usually just make up a small number that I think would be tolerable by the person I'm speaking to in order to let them know anyone can enter at any time and not be intimidated by the current value.

Agree on not being specific is sometimes not a satisfactory answer for people who are close to you like family. I usually say a combination of some arbitrary Low number and then small amounts on a regular basis.

I was just in Japan for a week and was actively looking for places that accept bitcoin while walking around. I saw not one place. Granted I was in Osaka and Kyoto and not in Tokyo where probably it is more widespread and yes I know there are stores there that accept them. But it’s not as rampant as it’s made out to be on Reddit.

I live in Singapore and use gdax with a US account. Both with and without a VPN works fine. Hong Kong should be fine as well. China may give you issues though due to their firewall.
