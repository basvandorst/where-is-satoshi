It's up to the community to revitalize the tipping economy ^^, so we should work on that as a community. 
As for the mods, if they are, that's sad. But, I could implement this flair on here in ten minutes flat. It's just some copypasta and tweaks. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:59:48
Still, that's no reason to not at least try to revitalize the tipping ecosystem in the Bitcoin subreddit. I think by diversifying the ways a user can tip, we increase its visibility, and hopefully, once again make it a common practice. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 08:48:29
I don't see how it should affect it. If they're disobeying one of the top rules by that point I don't think they'll care about throwing a Bitcoin address into their post, breaking yet another rule (unless there's a bot that tries to filter Bitcoin Addresses).


I think, worst case scenario, the increase in begging posts would be negligible 
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:11:07
While I do love ChangeTip, it's relying on an external service, something I prefer to do relatively little of when it comes to handling money. I'd love to see tipping revitalized in the Bitcoin-space, and while this is unlikely to bring it back, it would put it front and center, even more than ChangeTip does. 
EDIT: Minor grammatical change.

Expanding a bit here:


@_date: 2014-06-21 11:56:45
I'm not sure if there are constraints on string length, or if it will parse any image tags or pass anything into the CSS params. Nothing could be done with dynamic images either since Reddit doesn't allow external images. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:53:02
I understand if it's not implemented, but if it's "too much work", then that's truly the laziest admin in history, since there's not much left to do except copy and paste stuff into the appropriate sections and upload a single 16x16px image. Not to badmouth the admin, but seriously, if the only reason it's not implemented is laziness, then sheesh. I'll do it if the admin doesn't want to. Albeit, there are other potential caveats which I haven't identified. 
EDIT: For reference, it took me less than 10 minutes to fully implement on my demo server. Writing the CSS and tweaking it to look nice was how I spent the majority of my time, and that only had to be done once.

I find it staggering that people are supporting the owner of the site, and not the person requesting removal of *their own project* from the site. Now I think the site is grand, and that their idea of supporting developers is novel, but this is ridiculous. It shouldn't be that hard to add a blacklist, and allow developers to opt themselves into it, because guess what, unsolicited donations do cause a taxation problem. 
This isn't an issue of Bitcoin, or unsolicited donations, but the issue of respecting a developer's wishes when it comes to the project *they* spent time on. Also, monetarily incentivising contributions arbitrarily, in my opinion, starts to defeat the purpose of FOSS. Now incentives like [BountySource]( created by the project maintainer are a positive influence, resulting in meaningful action, instead of arbitrary commits that, while useful, do not contribute in a meaningful way to the project as a whole. (E.g. Typo fixes, aesthetic changes, etc.) 
If anything, this site should be abhorred by the Bitcoin community, and developers as a whole, because I find their practices sketchy, spammy, and misleading. Their business model may leave people with a bad taste in their mouth, of both the service, and maybe even tangentially Bitcoin, which is a big downside in my book. This is coming from a guy who loves getting tips for his projects. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:27:01
I agree that it's an awesome platform, but it's a third party service where I have to deposit my coins. I really do appreciate ChangeTip, but when it comes to dealing with Bitcoins, I would prefer to use it from a wallet that's wholly under my control. ChangeTip does have numerous advantages, ease of use, along with the slew of features that can be implemented in off-chain transactions, but that whole third party thing does give me pause. Perhaps the flair and ChangeTip could work hand in hand. I'm not sure how, or if it'd even be feasible, but it'd be entirely possible to come up with something. 
Regardless, thanks for the feedback :)

Expanding on my previous thoughts, it may be possible to implement QR codes via a Userscript or something, that could recognize Bitcoin addresses by pattern, and then dynamically use a JS library to render a QR code or something. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 19:21:00
It could easily be used with any number of cryptocurrencies. 
In fact, the only tweaks that need to be made would be the background color, and the background image. That could be done on a flair-specific basis, and just reuse the majority of the code that's identical between flairs. The background image was just a 16x16px image I found with the magic of Google, so shrink down any coin image to that size, upload it to Reddit, and you're good to go. If you wanted to implement this on a specific subreddit, let me know and I can help with implementation.
Also going to PM you about the DAC tip idea. 
EDIT: This will likely be implemented on in the future, but this topic will continue to be focused on developing this here on @_date: 2015-08-16 20:47:52
Admins enforce the rules of Reddit. Mods, however, enforce the rules and values of their own subreddit. They aren't required to allow any external content. (A la private subreddits/approved submissions) It's really up to the mods. 
EDIT: I accidentally a word.
@_date: 2012-09-14 23:00:38
Well soon that software may very well BE Square.
@_date: 2012-09-03 07:29:39
Any suggestion on if it should use a browser based wallet service as default or simply transform addresses into Bitcoin protocol links?
@_date: 2012-09-11 15:09:23
Brilliant! I like the show on hover/click to copy idea! 
@_date: 2012-10-08 08:40:51
Your logic is fundamentally flawed. This isn't greed, this is a self correcting system of supply and demand. As much as people may dislike these "high" fees, they're much lower than most, if not all fiat-based payment processing/currency exchanges. For example, this past summer I traveled through Europe and needed some Euros. In a rush, I foolishly chose the first currency exchange place I saw. I was charged €4.95 plus 7.5 percent. So please, this isn't greed, for every dollar that goes through this service, they get between 1 and 5 cents. Considering they host a wallet, process transactions/exchanges and carry out numerous Bitcoin related functions that must put a massive amount of load on their servers. Chances are, they spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on hosting, maintenance, support, and the like. So think about those fees in perspective, and I wish you luck in your future. (supposedly Bitcoin-free by your own account)

I am more than interested in this! I would love to work on the scan2accoubt part of this! Contact me?
@_date: 2012-09-11 01:46:00
That's a fantastic idea! I PMed the mods and got a reply from theymos saying that he had thought about it before, but the clutter was indeed an issue which is why I suggested firstbits. It's not hard to get a Firstbits address, in fact it's ridiculously easy and good to keep everything sorted out.
@_date: 2012-09-24 04:22:20
Your explanation is quite detailed. Kudos to you.

While the fact of windows is that it's designed for the less technically inclined, it is still unethical to utilize any services on any computer regardless of operating system without prior approval from the owner of the system. Typically the definition of a botnet is a network of computers infected by some form of malware, and I am disheartened that OP used to sell his illegal network.

Mother of god! Take yourself and your nonsensical arguments back to 4chan!
@_date: 2012-09-10 04:19:40
Both suggestions by manly-bits and losermcfail are good, but what it looks like you need is a step by step guide. 
1. Download [pywallet](
2. Make sure you have both [Python 2.7]( (I don't think it's compatible with Python 3.x.x yet) and [Twisted]( and [read this](
3. Place pywallet in the directory with your wallet.dat file and open up Command prompt, and cd over to where your bitcoin directory is (e.g. "cd C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Bitcoin") (assuming you're running Windows). 
4. Type in "pywallet.py --dumpwallet".
5. Open the resulting JSON file in your favorite text editor, possibly Notepad.
6. Copy that data down.
7. Head over to [Blockchain]( and create a wallet.
8. When you have your wallet all set up, log into it and along the top bar, you should see various headings, among which will be "Import/Export". Click there
9. Acknowledge the warning, but please for the love of god, read it first.
10. On the left hand panel, click on "Import Backup"
11. Paste the data from pywallet into the text box.
12. Click on "Import Wallet" and wait for it to finish. Voila! You're done!
I think I got that all right, but if I messed something up, feel free to correct me!

Somewhat, the paper wallet is typically a printable page with address, private key, a qr code and other pertinent information. A brain wallet is a memorable phrase seeded by a unique password or hash of some sort.
@_date: 2012-06-11 19:51:19
I was thinking about trying to make a site like this :) thanks for making one :D username is caffeinewriter. I look forward to contributing quality content to your site

Not to mention automated backups. As for security tips, always keep the bare minimum in your hot wallet. Keep the rest in cold storage.
@_date: 2012-09-18 04:44:32


Right, and the tooth fairy really put that $5M under your pillow.
Edited for factuality
@_date: 2012-12-15 21:12:50
Cold storage is where your wallet can't be touched by a remote attacker. This is typically done through a non-Internet connected computer holding the wallet, a brain wallet, or a paper wallet, though I'm sure there are some other ways as well.
@_date: 2012-09-10 05:47:24
If you're talking about BTC Mining apps, until the technology contains the hardware necessary to effectively mine Bitcoins, there is no point, since CPU mining is essentially useless against dedicated Bitcoin miners and GPUs. It sucks, but it's true. If you're talking about wallet apps, there's already one from Blockchain.info, I don't know about Android, since I'm an iOS user.
@_date: 2012-09-10 14:15:55
Still, it'd be nice to have a flair system in place similar to what does.
@_date: 2012-06-28 20:25:56
Considering I only have .55BTC total, yeah, that's fairly generous. 
@_date: 2012-08-18 08:46:11
Perfect ignoring the fact that you neglected to put a tl;dr at the end, but all laziness asides, that was a stunningly beautiful explanation.
@_date: 2012-08-14 05:15:20
The US doesn't recognize Bitcoin as an official currency, making it no more illegal than betting flash games.
@_date: 2012-09-10 05:29:25
Do you know if it'd be a good idea to PM the mods about this? Or just wait and see?
@_date: 2012-09-22 09:20:06
Personally, to further protect my wallet, I'd use the TrueCrypt Hidden Volume feature with a fake wallet in the outer volume.
@_date: 2012-08-18 08:44:28
And then Bitcoin would be essentially valueless because if anyone has your address they could quickly brute force the keypair, allowing them to drain your account.
@_date: 2012-08-19 02:52:55
It's just hypothetical saying if the key pairs were brute forcible, that Bitcoin would be essentially worthless.
@_date: 2012-09-03 07:26:24
TIL that you should never look at reddit when tired. Why? Because my mind just crossed "Reddit" and "YouTube" together to form "I saw this vid on RedTube". Anyways, will look up video on the correct site now.

It's great that Bitcoin has this. It should definitely help bring some awareness to Bitcoin, as well as creating some excitement in the existing community.

I've been a happy Bitcoin Friday participant as a customer since year one :) I'm loving how this has grown. Hopefully one of these years I'll make it in as a merchant!

Perhaps that's also its strength. There can be no rampant inflation. The problem of scarcity is instead solved by its infinite divisibility, currently enabled to 10^-7, and can be expanded if the need arises. Instead of throwing money at the problem, it takes what it already has. If it truly comes to this, the value would likely skyrocket as well, since transactions could be as low as a single Satoshi.
