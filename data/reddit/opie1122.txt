Wow! I knew it was pretty high, but I decided to check it out, as I had never used CB. It's safe to say, I am transferring my coin out and switching to CoinBasePro instead.
For comparison I tried a $100 transaction price at the moment:
$100 USD using Cashapp you would receive $98.86 worth of coin = $1.14 deducted from your coin recieved or "fee" for buying. (they use a higher rate instead of a "fee")
$100 USD using CoinbasePro you would receive $99.79 worth of coin - .25c fee = 46cents bto recieve more coin and for a cheaper fee.
CoinBasePro 99.54 with transaction fee vs 98.86 on Cashapp (Hopefully I did my math right lol)

Are you questioning my chart?I'll have you know that I put some serious time and analytical data research based on the most recent and past trends. Along with emperical analysis provided by the most successful bitcoin gurus in the planet. You think I'd just fire up Microsoft paint and draw approximately 5 lines and slap "Hodl bitch" on the side of it? Definitely questioning your Intelligence. My even better than best regards, Sir.

If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck. Definitely a scam, wouldn't trust it at all. If you did receive any coins, just open up coinbase itself and log in using the official website. If there are no coin, then there are no coin.

Agreed friend!  I too hope it doesn't happen. We definitely do not need to go to the moon. It's all staged in Hollywood anyways.

Yeah I noticed this the other day when trying to send some coin, bech32 addresses don't seem to be supported by cashapp atm.
