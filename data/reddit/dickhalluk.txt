Iv'e been trading 0.5 BXT at a time and have had to give up. There just isn't enough coin in the exchange even for these relatively small transactions.

EDIT: I've just had a couple of emails from BitPay, saying someone has had a payments of about 500usd refused. My account is not validated yet so can only take payments of upto 100usd. Please contact me if you want a Bitcoin address to send bigger payments to. The BitPay limit should be raised in a couple of days.
I don't know if there is some rule here about mentioning your own business, if there is I apologize for breaking it, please remove this post.
Anyway, I imagine I'm the first rock climbing gear shop to be accepting Bitcoin?
Only small amounts at the moment I'm afraid. Until my Bitpay account is verified anyway.
I do really hope I start getting Bitcoin sales though, chargebacks are really painful, and it would give me loads more confidence when posting overseas.

Do I count the value of my house and business assets when working this out?
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:40:55
Just cracked open a fresh one!
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:23:23
Sorry afraid not.
I can ship to the US in a couple of days, it gets expensive though.
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:51:35
OK right, I didn't get it sorry!
Good idea about the Bitcoin Logo, I will do that.
And I'm glad you like the site, thanks a lot.
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:32:45
Yep, I have shipped to Canada before. Takes about 3-4 days. Ropes are heavy so, not being at work I'd guess £60. But the good news is I don't have to charge sales tax when shipping outside the EU, so that's 20% off the price straight away.
If you like just let me know which rope you want and I'll give you an all in Bitcoin price when I'm back in the shop tomorrow morning (10 hours or so).
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:16:52
Thanks a lot, and I hope so.
Bitcoin seems so much better for the merchant. Fraud has been a big worry for me over the last year or so.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:25:58
I've got 2 Shopify stores.
I was using BitPay on one of them but have just moved to Coinbase as it is free, whereas BitPay charge 1%.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:03:50
You are right, I'll get that done.
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:01:09
When i last checked a couple of days ago you still couldn't add UK credit cards or bank accounts.

Ah you got me! Typo.

I've never shipped to Rusdia actually. Hopefully I can ship by road, in which case it's probably £30 for upto 30kg. I'll check later.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:23:50
And Shopify uses BitPay, so better to just count BitPay accounts.
I have 2 Shopify stores, one if which takes Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:54:28
Is that all we get?
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:42:28
Great, thanks.
As I said to Randy above, I don't have to charge sales tax when shipping to the US, so that's a 20% saving.
If you want a quote just send me an email and I'll work out a Bitcoin price for you.
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:22:34
Thanks a lot.
We are not finished with them yet, they are however pretty time consuming, almost as bad as the custom photos....
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:16:24
It's about time someone did this!
Are Coinfloor thought to be trustworthy? Min deposit is £500, so I can't even test them out with a small amount.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:03:22
Ok will do.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:29:24
Also the title of this post, while correct is a little misleading.
Shopify has not activated Coinbase checkout on 100k stores, they have allowed merchants to use the Coinbase integration should they want to.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:57:29
Volume has been really low all day. I don't think it was down time as the site was working for me.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:32:46

Britain isn't really "European".

So if something is listed at £100, I can do it for £83.33 (100/1.2). Plus shipping.
The website is not setup to do this automatically however. I usually just use the extra 20% collected on international orders to cover the postage cost.
However I often just end up doing offline trades for international orders, as postage cost varies  quite a bit.
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:00:09
Thanks! Depends on the weight and value of course, but most orders to France I could ship for £15 (0.045btc).
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:42:31
Withdrawals are processed though their bank in Poland for now. There is a £10 fee and presumably a bank charge.
They say faster payments are on their way for withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-07-15 22:15:55
It's also worth mentioning that I, as a merchant of 2 Shopify stores only learned about this though Reddit. Didn't even get an email as far as I am aware.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:01:59
Woohoo! Excited!
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:35:26
Thanks for pointing out the £1,000 withdrawal minimum, I hadn't noticed that, I've just changed my settings to cash out in Bitcoin.
Presumably they do not have a GBP account and need to take enough in fees to cover their bank charges.
I've had 2 charge backs this year totaling about £500 but have elected not to fulfill several thousands of pounds worth of fraudulent orders.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:58:56
Thanks very much, that was my first tip.
I'll definitely tip it forward. And thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2014-05-26 07:36:58
There are so many if these non-articles about. There is absolutely no news here.
Is the intention just to fill the entire web with "Bitcoin to the moon" type info?
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:44:55
Cool idea. I need to get into the whole topping thing, just never sure when it is appropriate.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:44:27
£500 is more than most people earn in a week.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:51:43
Ok, so the advantage is you can spend the funds without having to sweep and create a new wallet? However no great improvement on paper as far as cold storage is concerned?
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:20:33
One bad thing about the internet: it makes people who can't string a sentence together think they are journalists.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:46:37
Did someone just dump 1,000 BTC or somthing?
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:11:54
They are advertising 0% trading fees at the moment.

I haven't backed up the phrase yet, but I will not and delete. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:50:25
Phew! After a delete and reinstall the finds have arrived, thanks.
