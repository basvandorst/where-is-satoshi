also dude sorry you got downvoted, some shibes are rather dumb sometimes. nothing wrong with voicing your honest opinion- that's what the question asked.

Dude what calm down. I frequent and that's just being rude. There's no reason to try to imply something by putting down another community- if you want to be helpful, be helpful without being a jerk about it.

Some counterpoints, if I may.
It's only less secure right now. The network hashrate is skyrocketing (moon lol) due to the recent price increase, and because it's scrypt rather than sha, the likelihood of ASICs dominating the market decreases significantly because the cost to hash/s ratio is much higher. Besides, as referenced before- 51% attacks aren't really an issue. I mean, in theory, yeah, you can do it, but if one gets implemented, all the miners on that pool will quickly evacuate the premises and the value of the coin will drop dramatically- both of which are detrimental to any pool that would think about implementing such an attack.
The driving force of dogecoin is that it is based on something as silly as a meme. It's friendly and inviting- oh, what's this? A coin with a picture of a dog on it? Haha! What's this about? This makes it much more user friendly, and invites people who are turned away by bitcoins seemingly insurmountable entry barrier- $800 for a coin? Mining on my own computer would generate 0.0000001 BTC after a week? That doesn't really seem significant. 100 of thing A is always going to seem more attractive than 1 of thing B, even if thing B is worth 100x that of thing A. It's just how we work.
I honestly think dogecoin is going somewhere. "To the moon?" I dunno. Will it be something that I actually dedicate money to? Nah. But there's no harm in letting my computer mine overnight for the chance that it might be worth something significant in the future.

So literally no reason. Okay. Whatever floats your boat, dude. Just know that you're only hurting dogecoin in the long run, and being the opposite of what you proclaim the community to be.

Okay- that still begs the question, why? What's the point? What do you hope to achieve? No one is going to see that post and think, "oh, this dude being an ass is promoting dogecoin. That really makes me want to join dogecoin!" There's literally no reason for you to include that other than just being rude, and I'm pretty sure the dogecoin community is supposed to be friendly and welcoming rather than the opposite.
