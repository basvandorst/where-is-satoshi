I think it's a bad idea, there will always be a number of bitcoins that are not regularly used since people like to save them, so if there will always be some that are stagnant why do we care if they are stagnant or lost? They are still there either way.
Also, the fact that bitcoins can be lost and therefore removed from circulation is an attraction for those who use bitcoin as an investment engaging it's deflationary nature.
Also it's too late in the game to make a change this drastic it would shock people who are just getting into btc to discover that such drastic changes can happen.
Whatever time period you chose, there will always be a report of ' the protocol stole the coins I had been saving for x years' 
I can understand there is a certain charm to 21 million bitcoins being guaranteed to be in circulation but it's pros certainly don't out weigh its cons in my humble opinion. ( and actually it's not exactly 21 million anyway so not even so charming )

You can't track an input to an output where there are multiple of both in a transaction. 
This is a consequence of the design, and a good thing too since it enables some level of obfuscation of the origin of funds. See coinjoin et al

It's cheap remittances they need, I'd simply use the 10k to buy bitcoins from the local people and to raise local awareness of the fact that I'm buying in cash in their local currency for good rates. This should give them confidence to have their family members abroad buy bitcoin and send them bitcoin remittances instead of using western union. Should be a win win if it's set up right.

Using bitcoin has a myriad of benefits you haven't touched upon. Even though Satoshi, USGov and the winklevoss amongst others have large holdings. They can only spend them once. The distribution might favour early adopters but it's still a million times better than any other currency.
' there will be a presumption of guilt' this saddens me to hear you say this, are you American? I'm not, but I thought everybody would stand up for the right to be presumed innocent. Instead your gleefully advertising your own failure to protect your own freedoms like it's some sort of 'I told you so ' triumph.
The necessity of converting one currency to another is not a feature of bitcoin, it's a feature of currency in general. If you want to transact with someone who operates in another currency, you have to exchange it. Why is BTC to USD any different from USD to EUR. It's not a weakness of EUR that you have to convert to dollars when holidaying in America is it.
Mining is as feasible for you as it is to anyone else, go learn chip design and build your own asic like countless others have done.

Remittance is expensive because it is massively regulated, bitcoin remittance business will also have the same huge burden of regulatory compliance paced upon them. Therefore remittance via bitcoin will only have impact when it is not via a dedicated bitcoin remittance organisation but is done via people organising it between themselves. Things like mycelium local trader, localbitcoins.com and have a solid reliable exchange in every country would help.

Indeed, and if in 50 years time we realise that mainstream economics was correct and the bitcoin becoming the world reserve currency was a terrible idea due to the deflationary death spiral we have been living in for the past decade then more than 50% of users might want to change the block reward and this is the mechanism that they would use. And it would be valid.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:31:59
No, it's not possible to firewall bitcoin because any channel of communication can be used to pass new transaction or block messages to the more connected parts of the network. Well see this play out in coming years and projects like jgarziks space nodes will keep the block chain synced for those jurisdictions who attempt to censor or ban it.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:05:18
The impact of not being able to send a transaction is immediate and affects me directly, in the moment. It's far greater than the impact of a 51% attack that hasn't happened yet, with any real consequence. After the first major 51% attack probably people will react differently but until then I don't believe the threat of a 51% attack will move the price much.  Which is a shame and a consequence of lack of education.

The doctor said that since it was only one, it would be OK to wait a couple of days for it to pass through her system, if it didn't she would have to have a fairly major surgery to remove it.
The danger is if it's more than one that they will pinch together some parts of the intestine or something and remain there until they rust and rot through the intestine wall.
Just before the deadline she passed the very rusted and decayed Zen magnet, much to the relief of all concerned.

Inflation from block reward + merchants converting btc to fiat creates constant downward price pressure.  Countered only by new growth in users/speculators and demand for which they need to buy with fiat. Fiat doesn't work very well on the weekends so new buyers can't fund their exchange accounts until late Tuesday/Wednesday usually, hence we seem to have a little dip from  Sunday to Wednesday. That's my theory anyway....
@_date: 2014-08-08 10:58:20
The notion that we need to protect our 'identities' is old and boring, it comes from the fact that with your identity details, fraudsters can swindle your back accounts and credit cards.
For this action the banks are liable to return your funds! In many cases there is additional deposit protection too. 
Nobody cares or wants your identification information, just give it to them so you can buy and sell your btcs without restriction!!  Then we can hurry up the demise of the legacy banking system and faster switch onto better systems that use cryptography and digital signatures to protect your money rather than archaic circular proofs of identity
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:55:39
Interesting point, legal beagles in the Ross Ulbricht prosecution have decided to argue that bitcoin is within the legal definition of 'funds' (even though the IRS says it's property) and as such money laundering charges are appropriate since the wording is 'involves the movement of funds by wire or other means'....
Of course bitcoins don't really move per se, more like they have new owners appended to them, and in the case your describing above even that doesn't happen.

Well except that it's not just the miners that are in the dilemma, is the holders too. As a result to secure the value of the already secure coins, it would take people to use the system. People like you and me to be prepared to pony up the occasional tx fee will mean the system is useful again and with usefulness comes it's value. 
This is no different to the situation we are currently in with bitcoins value being directly tied to it's usefulness. It's the same with every asset/ commodity or currency and that's the way it should be in a free market.

It depends, to really know, you'd need to be a Canadian lawyer who has experience with financial cases.  Chances are very good that it will bring bitcoin some legal status alongside other forms of 'money', but 'legalese' often redefines a particular word just for a given act or statute. Any Canadians know if 'money' is equivalent to 'legal tender' in Canadian law? Since this would mean creditors are legally obliged to accept btc for settlement of any liabilities and it would also mean you can pay your taxes in btc.

It does use its own few super nodes to connect and route to and from the Bitcoin network instead of your own phone  maintaining multiple connections to the network itself, this is does mean that if one or more of those servers were compromised it could be an opening to an annoying attack or two, nothing that could empty your wallet though. I wouldn't worry about it personally, setups like this will become the norm as the block chain grows in size. It's hands down the best featured and most awesome wallet for android!
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:59:17
Forgive me for not answering, the internet is not going to get shut down.
However, interesting to note is that if it did... And the myriad number of ways of keeping bitcoin going without the traditional internet were also to all fail simultaneously and suddenly the blockchain stopped growing... Bitcoin could simply pause and resume at a later point in time with no detriment to anyones holdings/balances, all it would take would be for two or more full mining nodes to connect to each other and enough time to find the next blocks.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:27:51
Because bitcoin is global by nature any effort to shut it down would also have to be global... There is not enough collaboration between all the nations to coordinate a shutdown. Also if any one nation or a small subset encourages it, and another subset bans it, it gives the former an economic advantage over the latter. So whilst all banking interests and therefore governments would like to ban it they are likely conscious of being disadvantaged.

Not easily, most banks profit from being able to create money from nothing and charge interest on loaning it out. They might have a use case for bitcoin in that they do transfer money in between themselves in order to settle up accounts with each other but they already have the trust relationships required for this that bitcoin aims to circumvent, in fact that's kinda the point of banks. Also their original incarnation as leasers of secure gold storage facilities has been subverted by bitcoins because they don't need to be physically stored.
Not sure how banks can profitably get in on the action. In fact it's probably best if they just give up and go home now.

For those who can't wrap their heads around this, legal tender means that if you're are owed money you are bound by law to accept legal tender in payment of the debt.

Bitcoin protocol has solved the problem of double spending which is why it's a breakthrough.  There are no instances of the same coins having been spent twice.  Save for those spends which are in blocks which will be orphaned, but they don't matter cause there not in the chain.
Yes it does, as far as bitcoins are concerned if it's not in the chain it didn't happen, I'd go check out the khan academy bitcoin videos they're great for understanding this complex topic
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:57:41
True but that doesn't make them one and the same, to test this simply get Gavin to change the mining algo in the reference implementation and you'll see the miners rapidly code and release a variant that switched it back to what the protocol says it should be.
It's real important that we get miners away from the reference implementation for this very reason.  Changes to the reference implementation do not change the protocol except by the consent of the masses and by definition the consent of the masses is what defines the protocol, no ?

Theres lots of different wallets software these days, and transactions can be formed in various ways, there no way to be sure why that transactions structured like that unless your the author. However generally you can use whatever inputs you like and create whatever outputs you like, if the sum of the inputs is greater than the sum of the outputs the minors claim the difference in the fees.

The idea that we should protect our identity and protect our data is perpetuated for two reasons, first and foremost because our identity paper trail is the primary vehicle used by the state to keep us tracked and in check. Second because of the inherent lack of security in the incumbent financial systems means that misappropriated data is all that is required to commit massive financial frauds for which the banks and financial institutions are themselves liable. 
They don't want our 'data' as much as they want control over the distribution rate of the dominant currency, you can sleep easy that bitcoins weren't created for that purpose.
Besides, used properly, its not even revealing much at all.

Only miners get to vote, they vote by allowing or disallowing a block to be added to their copy of the blockchain. This block may be controversial because it contains some non standard transactions or some other content which is deviant from what has previously been allowed.
If other miners agree and begin building the next block on top of that one, they are agreeing with the vote. If no others want the protocol change that this deviant block reflects to be permitted they refuse to mine on top of it and it becomes an orphan in their copy of the block chain, eventually more than 50% of the network will have cast a vote by either including or orphaning that block and consensus has been reached one way or another on the protocol change.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:48:31
Yes. The forks won't grow very fast due to the difficulty remaining the same whilst each group would have only a fraction of the mining power required to increase their forks chain length in the ten minute target. we could infer how reassembly of the network is going by looking at block creation times.
@_date: 2014-07-12 09:34:49
Wrong, bitcoin is and will continue to establish itself in the mainstream because it's better than its competition. However no merchant would be wise to exclusively accept it, that's simply bad business and bad customer service. 
You know the significance of 'legal tender' isn't much but is essentially that by law merchants have to accept it in payment of debts. So I'm not even sure it's viable for merchants to only accept btc and not their local legal tender currency.

Because it accomplishes nothing more than if the user simply pays once per month with a regular transaction.

Except that if you want your cloud mining contract to start anytime soon, the provider would have had to front the capitol to buy the equipment. If they've fronted the capitol or already or crowd sourced it or whatever, why are they giving away their chance to profit. It just doesn't make sense, unless they have previously calculated that the mining gear will inevitably run a loss and therefore they make a bit from letting other people rent the loss making hashpower from them.

Blockchain.info certainly stores the 'value at time of transaction' with every transaction so you could poll their APIs to get it, or cross correlate with price history charts from a multitude of sources.
But what about change? And tumblers? , the substantial amount of gambling transactions, coinjoin etc, I'm not sure this type of analysis is even possible is it?

It's true you can destroy  bitcoins by burning them, but you can also subdivide bitcoins infinitely, current standard implementations are too 8 places, but there's no reason the network couldn't subdivide further in the future if necessary. Even if all but one bitcoin was destroyed that single one would be enough to service the entire network. - I think anyway...

If its true that this system of law can only be changed with lots of money, then it's not a system I want to be a part of. Regardless of regulation and legislation the core protocol won't change at all so all we would be doing is seeking legitimacy in the eyes of those who have previously kept us in effective poverty. a system of corrupted law for the rich. This system has taken enough if my money already, 50% tax on everything i earn plus 17% on The remainder when i spend it, and that's just the beginning. Forgive me for not getting enthused about shelling out more money simply for some one to tell me that it's 'legal' to do what I'm already doing with bitcoin.

Bit puzzled here, there's 25 new coins per block. End of. Each one can be circulated and traced back to it's origin. If anyone tried to create a block with more or less than the current block reward it would be ignored and not included in the chain, likewise if anyone signs transactions with inputs that have already been spent elsewhere, it would be ignored and not included in the chain.
 There's no question about counterfeit bitcoins.
I can't find a block chain.info api includes the 'value at time if transaction' attribute but it's available on the website so you could write a scraper that takes a txhash and returns the first value at the time it was made but I think getting historical price data would be better.

That's a different issue, borrowing and repaying loans is, as you say a useful activity for society and humanity. But using debt as a method of bringing new money into the supply and then handing over the power of control over the maximum rate at which that can happen to private companies is tantamount to economic enslavement. I look forward to the day I'm able to arrange finance for purchases in btc and it's inherent deflationary nature will be as, if not more effective than interest at encouraging timely repayments.

Effective, zero. any one can use it anywhere any time if they are determined and a little savvy. Legal or not.
No government ( except possibly north Korean ) would dare to try to make it illegal for peer to peer buys sells and goods exchanges. This is 2014. Governments aren't quite so deluded any more. ( not even the Chinese, obviously they'd like to ban it entirely but haven't for that reason )

It was indeed, bear in mind satoshi and bitcoin gave us a lot we can absolutely rely on, secure frictionless payments, global network, no middlemen etc, even after the block rewards end.

It seems to me that the bank have allowed someone else access to your account, surely it's simply a case of issuing a small claim against the bank. They cannot possibly have provisions in their terms that okay them to dip into your account like this.
Edit, just read about 'posted to your account' and '24 hours'
Check to see if it's on their terms that cash deposits aren't credited / cleared for 24 hours, if it's not there, you can certainly make a small claim for the amount and it sounds like your be doing the LBC community a favour by seeing this through to the end.

With all the talk of nodes in space and broadcasting the block chain over dvb and DTMF phones, what would be a nice idea is a transaction transmitter that took a transaction as input and turned it into a radio signal and then bounced that signal off the moon. The idea being that combined with nodes in space broadcasting the blockchain and a receiver somewhere that forwards the txs to a miner, we would then have bitcoin, without the need of internet connection available everywhere in the vicinity of our planet.
And yes, we would have truly gone to the moon..

I really wonder about the shelf life of the bitcoin ATM industry. For obvious reasons they are gonna be huge hacker targets, also will be targets of more traditional thievery, aswell as continually undercut by those who either live nearby or work in the venue.

I don't really understand your point,I'm sure you are aware that miners can pick and choose which transactions they want to include in their blocks based on the fees attached to them. 
If others are paying high tx fees, they are not securing my transactions or the chain for me at all. They are securing it for themselves. My coins were already secured x blocks ago by the fee I paid back then.

Cloud mining, on a fundamental level doesn't make sense, why would the provider allow you to profit from hardware they are already running? 
If it's a genuine setup then the cloud mining provider actually losses money by selling you a mining contract instead of using it themselves.

My guess... I reckon one day there will be a signed message stating his intention to begin using his coins, it'll explain that he's gonna do so in such a fashion as to not affect the price. then little by little we'll see the vast majority of them being donated to charitable and good causes around the world. He'll also then begin to live in the lifestyle he wants (and deserves). He'll never convert any of them to fiat though, he'll wait until he can buy what he wants in bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if one day a donation from Satoshi serves to bail out entire countries from their fiat woes.

This is ridiculous, I agree bitcoin is sovereign as much as any protocol can be but why on earth would you suggest subordinating yourself to it.  Bitcoin is the first vehicle for commerce that you can use without restriction regardless of your 'citizenship'.  And no one can legitimately claim authority over you, ( unless of course your one of those who gives away their sovereignty and participates in forced democracy by participating in the comical farce of 'voting for your elected representative') so why would you want to be a citizen of the block chain as opposed to finally being able to act as a sovereign entity in commerce yourself by simply making use of it as it was intended.

What I would really like to see is the car insurance industry shaken up, 
In UK corporations can register a bond with the driver and vehicle licence authority. This means that they don't have to have cover, and claims are taken direct from the bond but if there are no claims the bond can be reclaimed at the end of the desired insurance period.
There must be a way to negotiate the red tape required and deliver a platform that could crowd source the required bond and enable the cheapest possible, refundable, insurance policy to people. 
Reputation based contributions and crowd sourced arbitration for claims on the bond possibly...
Features of bitcoin could be really useful here.

@_date: 2014-07-14 14:06:57
Well it's non problem, we are back to my earlier point, miners themselves have an additional incentive to mine in the face of no block reward and no fees which is that if they don't the value of their own holdings will drop too, along with the resell value of their hardware. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:04:41
That is all quite correct but your talking about transactions that aren't in the chain. Unconfirmed by definition mean not in a block of the chain. If it's not in the chain then the transaction hasn't happened yet and merchants would be foolish to dispense products before they have been paid.   In those rare cases where a transaction gets in a block and that block is the top of the chain but subsequently gets discard/orphaned because another branch becomes longer then where is the original transaction?... Not in the chain. So it hasn't happened.
I guess what I'm saying is that your right you can counterfeit bitcoins a hundred times over, but a bitcoin transaction doesn't mean anything until it's a few block deep in the chain and that doesn't happen to transactions that are counterfeiting coins. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:56:06
Are you sure?? I can't see why if more than 50% of the hashing power is voting to amend the block reward, the block reward wouldn't be amended. True the users will flee in droves and control over a system no one is interested in using isn't worth much but it doesn't make the chain invalid. Does it?

What's the deal?
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:32:18
This is not a failing of bitcoin, this is because we don't have any exchange in UK, or anywhere in the world with reliable GBP liquidity for them to cover it back to fiat and cash out. The reason those are missing is also not a failing of bitcoin but is due to the UK banking sector still not being prepared to work with bitcoin exchanges/ business. This is all despite the UK having one of the most attractive tax / regulation regimes that bitcoin business could hope for.
I believe it says something about the relationship between big finance and government in the UK. Hopefully Coinfloor, who is our most promising looking exchange at the moment will manage to convince one if the big high Street banks in UK to work with them eventually, then Britain's faster payments network combined with its regulatory and tax approach will make UK a bitcoin hub.

This question doesn't really make sense, the us government doesn't have any authority to regulate things outside if the USA, although they do attempt to regulate foreign business that have us customers. Regardless since they have no authority to regulate in this way, and even if they did attempt it no possible way to enforce such regulations, it's a redundant question. If they did try it, we wouldn't replace bitcoin we would just ignore said regulations and their associated penalties.
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:55:37
Because that's the rules.
Part of the process of mining a block is creating a transaction that mints new coins and the quantity is laid out according to a predetermined schedule. Someone could try to create a block wherein the generation transaction contains more than the predetermined amount of coins, thus increasing the 21 million cap, but the block would be invalid and therefore no one else would add it to their copy of the chain.

As I understand it, and I'd appreciate correction if I'm wrong, if you sell bitcoin from a single address you'll have to route the change back to that address too, which puts a rate limiter on your transactions of one per block/every ten minutes.

I don't see the benefit, say I want to buy some gold and a Nigerian prince has coloured some coins to represent his gold holdings. I can buy those coins, but without a legally binding contract and a justice system to enforce it, what is to say I'm the owner of any gold?   
That given if coloured coins needs a contract and a legal system to back them, why would I use coloured coins at all? Why not simply use existing contract law?
And, what would a legal system think about adjudicating a dispute in which it has no power or ability to control the assets in question?
And what about in the cases where two legal systems don't agree... Coloured coins doesn't let me buy shares of a company in north Korea any more than I can today,  even if a north Korean took some time to color his coins and state they are representations of shares in his company... It doesn't make sense... Am I missing something?

Not to put a dampener on things but my feeling is that these ATMs are going to prove a non viable business proposition. They will inevitably attract other sellers lingering by the machine offering to undercut it's rates. Also they will be the target of every possible manner of hack/fraud attempt continually. It seems like a natural extension to bitcoin especially since in many places it's not exactly easy for people to get their first coins, but I suspect that as more options to get coins online appear the idea of going to a local ATM to either buy or sell for fiat will seem rather superfluous. An ATM with no AML/KYC might find a market but it's probably not legal....

Hi Jimmy, 
Occasional wikipedia donator here, I'd certainly donate more if BTC were an option. 
Here's a solution that doesn't involve any complicated wallet set up, provides no exchange rate risk and is immediately implementable. 
1) Get a verified account at Bitstamp.
2) Get a machine that you can run QTOpenTrader on 24/7
3) Advertise your Bitstamp deposit address as your 'Donate with BTC address on Wikipedia'
4) leave OpenTrader running with a rule as follows.
'When my BTC balance goes greater than zero, sell all my BTC at market price.'
5) At whatever interval you like, request a fiat withdrawal from bitstamp to wikipedia.
So when a donation is received it goes straight to your bitstamp account, is detected and a sell order is placed by OpenTrader automatically and you can forget about it and withdraw your fiat at regular intervals. 
Depending on the amount of donations, your fees in this case will be lower than 0.5% per trade.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:57:59
Why do you think that? It's not the case.
Suppose your coins were last moved x blocks ago, since then everyone has decided transactions are too expensive and as a result mining has ground almost to a halt because there is no block reward and nobody is offering up any fees. No blocks are getting mined at all.
It doesn't change the fact that your coins are securely where you left them, and you can move them securely by offering up the lowest value fee any minor will accept to mine the next block.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:48:46
I read it, its nonsense. It suggests that a better way to eliminate double spends would be simply to timestamp all transactions. Without explaining how to make tamper proof timestamps. It goes on to suggest that the halving block reward will result in halving of the hashing power, and as a result this makes it trivially easy for someone to rent enough cloud hashing power to execute a 51% in those moments after the hash rate has just significantly dropped.  Hmm...

Also if someone did have such an computer fueled with the energy of an entire sun and wanted to use it to crack sha256, they would choose to mine not steal because as soon as anyone steals in that fashion all the btc become worthless.

@_date: 2014-07-14 12:13:18
No, there is no connection between someone who can afford to pay the miners a hefty fee for a rapid confirmation for their own transaction and someone else who can't afford to pay a fee. The first person gets the security of an instant confirmation and the second has an insecure unconfirmed transaction.  Regardless there is no mechanism which means that the rich person will be paying the fee on the transaction of the poor person. Either the poor person will be priced out of the system or, much more likely, they will eventually get mined as minors compete with each other to deliver security at the lowest possible cost to the benefit of all. Don't forget that if half the world are priced out of the system then bitcoin will lose allot of appeal and also value, the drop in the value of bitcoin would affect miners a great deal, therefore they have an incentive to process transactions even with zero fees in that sense.

OK just a majority agreeing to remine the chain from block 2.... Would take so long to over take they main chain that the main chain hashing power would grow to overtake that majority long before they got anywhere. To remine the whole chain you'd need almost the entire network to agree and stay agreed until the new chain was at least somewhere close to where we are today to have any chance of overtaking it. No ?
