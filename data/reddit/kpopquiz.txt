There's nothing that the website could possible do to your account. I can see why you wouldn't trust it though

If you use a different email and password from your coinbase account I can't think of any security issues. I'll check out that link.

Yeah I can't really recommend Coinbase even though I've been a user for 3 years

Exchange has lower fees (0.25% vs 1.5%). I wish I had known before I sold mine

I had some idiot try to promote OneCoin to me over FB messenger. His wording made it so obvious it was a scam.

Do they have automatic recurring buys?

Use gdax.com for lower fees

I see it as an investment. Most of my other investments are earning about 20% a year so if I can beat that then that's great. I don't need to get rich off of this. 161% would be amazing for any investment

Yeah the fee is fine for me. I'd be happy to pay it just wanted to see what my options were

What wallet could you use for this?

Yep a few brokers allow it. You can use Motif to buy shares of individual stocks. With Betterment you cannot choose your own stocks they will buy your portfolio for you

It's not super consistent but my own stock picks. A balanced portfolio of stocks/ETFs earns about 7% annually. I'm taking on more risk to get higher returns but that has worked out for me in the last few years.

Hmm not a bad idea

The winklevii are generally seen as jokes among the general population.

I think it will be 1 trillion each by next year.

How is it possible to not know how much you make before taxes?
