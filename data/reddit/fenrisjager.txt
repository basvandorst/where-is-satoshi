I don't think I'd personally like my account accessed only via my PIN number. The Government ID is for verification when you register, you don't need it further when using the ATM. Hand scan is used for verification when you buy/sell BTC, though.

Not a pain in the slightest. Took me five minutes from registration to Bitcoin in hand. Lot faster than, say, the whole online process with CaVirtex or MtGox.

This week, BitNational put up their brand new ATM. Today they had a promotion where the first 50 people that went down got some free BTC thrown at them after registering. The machine itself was probably one of the easiest, user-friendly pieces of equipment I've ever had the courtesy of trying.
The process of registering via the machine was simple.
-Enter phone number, wait for text message with confirmation number.
-Create a PIN
-Scan your hand a number of times so it can get an accurate read
-Enter Government ID into the card slot
-Wait for approval of registration (gives an estimate of 5 minutes, only took 1 for me!)
After you come back when your registration goes through, you simply put in your phone number, put in your PIN, scan your wallet via your phone or what-have-you, put in money and off you go! Really fantastic for me, since I don't like going to banks.
Thank you BitNational for the free BTC, and the fantastic ATM!

While the concerns are valid, keep in mind 5 minutes was for registration on top of the actual use of the ATM for purchase purposes. The actual process of buying took less than a minute.

As happy as this makes me, if I put in as much of an I investment in 2010 as I did in 2013, I'd be retiring right now.
