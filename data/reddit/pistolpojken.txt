Gemini isn't available in EU either it seems.

I was eating dirt or something.

Man, people are ignorant as fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:36:45
I wonder when you’re able to call yourself an expert. ’cuz there sure seems to be a loooot of them. 
Also weird to say ”no doubt” about something as speculative as btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:46:18
Well done!
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:55:16
I also bought at 17k, if I only was a bit more patient...

How do you know he doesn't?

A good nights laugh. Cheers

Does no one proofread this bullshit? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:14:10
Is there some kind of proof? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:46
Dude, at least he's trying to move away and is asking for help. Should he not have asked he might as well have stayed. Do you think you're making more people wanna ask for help when you shittalk the first guy who opens his mouth? Grow up. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:53:11
You’re not at all invested in Btc, so you create this post to make people feel even more bad about? What the fuck is the meaning? What do you want to hear? ”Yeah my life fucking sucks now, thanks for bringing it up again”.  Would that suffice?

If he wanted you to sell it immediately he wouldn’t have given you BTC, but plain cash or something boring. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:02:45
I HODLEDEDEDEDED
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:13:58
Really? I disagree, a correction at $6-7k at this speed before 2018 wouldn’t surprise me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:07:42
I'm a rocket sturgeon. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:04
Imo you’re in too deep to begin with then.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:42:51
And that is relevant how? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:35:22
Judging by his OP he bought btc.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:14:30
He has 49 kids, do you honestly think the guy gives a shit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:24
I'll allow it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:57
Of course, but it's not even in the same ballpark. BTC can't be compared with a lottery. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:35:21
Hahaha I came for this. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:12:36
You’re not seriously begging for btc right? ’Cuz that’s outright pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:19:15
You raped him so hard he had to delete his comment.
