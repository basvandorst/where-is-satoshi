But it works, and it's more untraceable than any of the other options suggested

A droid ultra.  Definitely a phone that's hard to find neat cases for.

Why not just find a trader in the US that takes WU or some other payment?  It seems much safer and there are plenty of people in the US accepting WU

San Diego, CA, December 3rd, 2014
The Founder and current Managing Director of SGB Enterprises L.L.C., Scott Booth, announced publicly today his professional commitment and cooperation with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (F.C.C.) in combating the continued importation, operation, marketing, and sales of alleged illegal Bitcoin and other alternative currency mining hardware by Bloomfield, Connecticut, based GAW Miners, L.L.C., a Delaware Corporation, d/b/a Geniuses at Work, GAW Corp., and Zenminer; Josh Garza, an Individual; John Does 1-10, and ABC Corps 1-10.
For the purpose of this press release, Mr. Booth specifically alleges:
Since approximately February 18th, 2014, the alleged violators, individually and collectively, have been and are still willfully and repeatedly violating Sections 302(b) and 333 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act)¹ in addition to Sections 2.103, 2.104, 2.105, 15.201(b), and 15.209 of the Commission’s rules (Rules)² by importing, operating, marketing, and offering for sale tens of thousands of unregistered, unlabeled, and uncompliant ASIC-based electronic Bitcoin mining devices valued in excess of ten million dollars. Furthermore, the alleged violators are continually operating at least one thousands of these unregistered, unlabeled, and uncompliant electronic Bitcoin mining devices within a single 150,000-square foot warehouse in Park Purvis, Mississippi, which are likely transmitting stray radio emissions that may overpower, jam, and/or interfere with legitimately authorized communication services; essentially making these devices federally prohibited “signal jammers”.³
When asked why GAW Miners and its primaries were isolated as a target to report to the F.C.C., Mr. Booth stated, “This process, which also includes existing complaint filings with the S.E.C., has been ongoing for a while now and we wanted to make sure a significant hardware industry based message could be sent by those who believe in the responsible promotion of what makes traditional “crypto-mining” possible along with ensuring the transparency and overall reputation of the alternative currency industry is not only maintained, but improved upon in the face of many setbacks over the previous 18 months due to the actions of those who can be seen as less than ethical perpetrators on both the hardware and financial side of this still emerging industry.” Mr. Booth further added, “With this in mind, we have compiled more than enough evidence, much of which was obtained recently in numerous grand-standing public admissions by Mr. Garza himself, and have forwarded the bulk of this evidence over to the F.C.C. in addition to the S.E.C. for follow-up enforcement action.”
Mr. Booth, who started his career in the technology industry over 20 years ago when he first became a licensed amateur radio operator under the call sign KC6TTR, later became a successful entrepreneur within the smart card and other embedded systems arenas, which then lead to the establishment of his latest international technology design and business development venture in 2007, SGB Enterprises L.L.C.. Mr. Booth has always promoted a progressive yet compliant high -tech industry that establishes a level playing field for all technological adoption; whether developed in one’s garage or within a large international corporation’s test lab. In doing so, Mr. Booth has often been an outspoken consumer advocate in various facets of the overall technology industry within the U.S., Western Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.

Bitcoin Fog.  It's a .onion site, though.

Could you explain why you think that?

I'll play devil's advocate for your situation as well:
Nowadays many gas stations rely on GPS technology to verify the validity of cards.  So when the GPS/etc goes down, the gas station can't process any card transactions.
If the gas station had simply accepted bitcoin, all they would have needed was an internet connection.
The way I see it, accepting both would eliminate these kinds of problems- one doesn't work, just try the other!

The only way it could be any easier is if they flashed their warnings in bold neon letters on every page.
I just fail to see how anyone making a financial transaction for hundreds of dollars wouldn't bother to learn how to use the site properly before making that transaction.
Sure, the site could make it more clear if it wanted, but that really isn't necessary because people should bother to read the warnings without flashing prompts

You dumbass. Did you bother to read the instructions on the site before you tried to buy from someone? Because they have instructions on how to use the site safely, for dumbasses like you.
I would feel bad for you if you didn't come complaining about localbitcoins as if you're not entirely at fault for your situation.  Stop saying that you know you were stupid, and then turning around and saying they didn't do enough.  No, you were just stupid, and didn't bother to heed their warnings, or even use their escrow service, which FYI, *their warnings mention that you should always use*

No, that's on me.  The problem is that something as simple as forgetting my PIN number has left me with no cash and no access to my bank account for almost 24 hours.
