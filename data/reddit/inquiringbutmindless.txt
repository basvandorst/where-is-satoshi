Yes Bitcoin-QT synchs up with no problem.
I'm scouring the logs now and I see that there is some problem where bitcoind gets executed but dies right away. If I knew more about reading the logs it would help, but I suspect I'm on the trail of the culprit.

Sheesh, now I see that not all runs of Armory result in error messages for bitcoind. I'm pulling my hair out here! I have no idea what is going on!

I figured out how to export the keylist from my cold-storage Armory and massaged the input so it contained only the private keys. 
I imported them to Electrum and it showed a balance much less than what it should have been!
Any ideas?

I let Armory start Bitcoin core and Armory is configured to find it "C:\Program Files (x86)\Armory\ArmoryQt.exe" --satoshi-datadir="n:\bitcoin\Bitcoin" --datadir="n:\bitcoin\Armory"
There is no indication on the dashboard about any problems going online.
I have read through the link you provided but It didn't really help.
I'm starting to get desperate!
I've also tried exporting my private key from my cold-storage  PC and importing into Electrum and Multibit, no joy.

I have the blockchain downloaded and synchronized via bitcoin-qt.
It's just that for some reason Armory fails to execute Bitcoind.exe so I can't get online. 
I checked my cold-storage balance last night with Armory and if all those private keys got exported &amp; imported correctly, Electrum should show the same balance. I agree with you that logic tells us that not all keys made it into Electrum or it would have shown the correct balance. I tried it several times and always got the same result.
Same with Armory - I agree I must be doing something wrong, but I've tried everything I could think of and it won't go online. I keep the blockchain on a non-system drive, but other than that it's a plain vanilla install. It should be straightforward.
Oh well, I'll sleep on it and see if that helps.
Thanks for your reply.

I'm running Armory 0.93.2 and Bitcoin Core 0.10.2.
It's like Armory never attempts to go online as far as I can see.
