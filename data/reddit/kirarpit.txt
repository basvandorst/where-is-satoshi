well you could put your public address and then sign the message using your private key. That way one could verify the funds corresponding to the public address and the signature using the public address. Which proves that it's the same person who signed the message and is the owner of the public address.

no that's perfectly fine, it's crypto 101. you should look into GnuPG to get a better idea. And to answer your question, you can sign/encrypt any digital document you want.

it breaks my heart to see so many of you brainwashed people. BTC is going to crash down to $4500 and BCH has a good chance to finally become the real bitcoin

You're right about how important ordering of the transactions is.
To make Graphene work, it requires a kind of canonical ordering which includes interdependencies of the transactions. I've heard it requires a hard-fork to implement that.
For a basic(not the best) example, one could discard the transactions which are dependent on the output which is not yet created for the next block.

it's fake i can tell. best thing about crypto is you can prove your story by signing it anonymously, which he didn't :)

what if they need even more time to propagate these 2 blocks and hence mine another empty block? this would keep going on if everyone starts doing this?

Remember bitcoin is still a very much experimental technology and one isn't advised to invest more than what they can afford to lose.
