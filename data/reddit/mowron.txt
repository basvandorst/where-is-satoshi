If using the app, close it and reopen. This has happened to me if I just bought coins and immediately try to transfer.

Let me rephrase this: I buy two trezors I send 1 btc from Coinbase to one of them. I used the recovery seed from the trezor that has 1 btc on it on the second trezor. What does each trezor now show?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:49:53
It clearly states in the post if you used your recovery seed on a different wallet. So that's what I'm asking. Will the old trezor show 0 btc?
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:11:34
What I am trying to figure out is what to do if my trezor is ever misplaced or stolen. So if you lose a trezor ideally you would restore to a app wallet then send them to a new trezor with a different seed.

This is the answer I was looking for, thanks.

Still no Xpubs from Trezor despite promising to add back after wallet adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:38:36
Never had a problem. I transfer out to my trezor all the time.

Also, in all seriousness if you fell on tough times and had to sell to make ends meet, etc. Then you did what you had to do, and there is absolutely no use in thinking you did anything other than what you had to do at the time.

My mutual fund wasn't near what it is now at that point. The stock market since Nov. has made a huge change to say the least. But, touche, you hard ass.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:13:54
You can "watch" (watch meaning see the amount of btc in it and the total USD it is worth, etc.) your trezor account without having to have the trezor physically with you by downloading an app on your phone. Xpub is the public address that you input into the phone app so it knows what wallet you want it to watch. Trezor has hidden this address from the user on their website, so  you can not watch your trezor wallet with a phone app like you could before segwit activated if you have your btc in a segwit wallet.

Use a credit card and pay it off out of your bank account. It's not that hard.

You just lifted this idea from Banking on Bitcoin on netflix.

So you bitch because your bank cut you off, then you bitch because of CC fees. Well I guess quit buying and STFU?

What I'm hoping it will do? I think there may be only one answer to this.....

Mine did this, working fine now.

Not trying to be a smart, ass. Well, maybe but no shit.

Well I guess don't buy btc then. Shit.... 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:02:51
I've never sold any coins, only bought, does that answer your question?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:14:46
It may have at one point, but it is only showin legacy addresses right now.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:00:33
Hey, we are all idiots retrospectively, because we look backwards. You because you sold at $600 and me because I didn't put all this in btc when I first bought at $750. So, embrace the suck.

Your question summarized "How much bitcoin will be a lot of  to own in 5-10 years"

I know it's been discussed over and over but for those coming to the comments for alternatives, what's the best Bitcoin wallet to switch to?
