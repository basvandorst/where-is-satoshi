Buddy of mine took out loans and maxed out his credit cards .. to invest heavily into mining when bitcoin was at 16,000, didn’t work out well
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:58:48
he said it was to prevent other false claimers from scamming people..but I think the reason is his own Financial goal, possibly the person he believes to be satoshi or at least the person that created the concept for bitcoin would increase or keep the momentum of the current trend going.
