What do you mean by  accountability ?

Patents are supposed to be libraries of ideas, it supposed to be if you read a patent, and were "skilled in the art" you would be able to make the item described in a patent, most patents are written is such a way unless you see the item, you would have no idea what the author was talking about, (sorry if I am telling you water is wet)
as for SpaceX not having patents (they do 
That might because if you file a patent in USA with military applications they can classify your work, (they did this to an Aussie, he was told to move to the USA, he was not allowed to use his invention independent of the USA military even the Australian military was not allowed access, (he filed in Australia and the USA)
I must admit if you read his patent you could build the damn thing, which is rare
What do you think about capitalism? 
Telsa is using it patents in a defense manner, a large part of Telsa &amp; SpaceX is a financial business,
he is getting very close to breaking laws regarding financial probity, I wonder if he is fan of Ayn Rand, (I know of several business with Ayn Rand philosophy that went bankrupt due to less than honest books)
I must admit I know a lot of large companies engage in similar behaviour
As for RSA my point was they had the mathematics and working software, 25 years before the general public,
(I have studied both law and mathematics to tertiary level, I hate switching between the two methods of though)
hmm I think you are talking about SHA 
Do you believe that bitcoin is anonymous, by default?

If they banned the previous versions why not this one? 
Which government? 
My wild guess is china  (yes I pulled that out of my arse) 
Yes the work is contracted, (why do you need public servants) 
Even large corporations have secret tech
Have you any experience with patents?
There are patents which are complete bullshit,
But some are holding revolutionary technology
Most are hidden under legal nonsense words
Did you know RSA encryption was invented by the UK government first, and they had been using it for years, (by public servants)  Clifford Cocks (that is his name on Wikipedia

Which part, I sure some parts are 20 years in the future technology wise

Family worked for governments in R&amp;D,
There is a lot technology that is never released by private industry and the government
I not sure who invented bitcoin, but it is the most traceable currency yet, (every transaction is in the ledger)

There is no evidence that the inventors of bitcoin made a financial profit, (yet, and they might of and we don't know)
I would like to know what sort of inventions can be made that are financial profitable if opened sourced, 
even Red Hat makes it money out of support services, (if something is truly open source other people can provide support)
as for your defence you can do that with regular bank accounts in australia, (we don't use cheques (much)) 
(In Australia there is not such thing as bank accounts with only one signatory, (most people don't know this)
I have two different banks explain to be it is either "both to sign", or "either to sign", it is not possible to open a bank account with one signatory, I am guessing it is a loophole for the government/banks, in one case I had to authorize myself to move money in between accounts at the same bank, so &lt;insert name here&gt; authorise &lt;insert name here&gt; to withdraw money, f**ked if I know why)
In Australia every bank transaction over $10,000.00; is supposed to be reported to the government,
as well as all transactions sending overseas, turns out the biggest bank was barely keeping records,
and told the government nothing, people were opening accounts with fake IDs, and sending money to Hong Kong,
You can do statistical analysis on bitcoin, it became a ledger for a lot of dodgy money,
government do this kind of forensic accounting, all the time, 
facebook has been known to figure out how people are related when they went through sealed adoptions, (yes facebook makes a lot of guesses but still)
target figured out a girl was pregnant before her father (who she was living with) did,just based on statistical analysis, on what she bought, it is getting to the stage were these companies know more about you then you do,
They can even predict  the likely-hood of you having a car accident based on what you eat,
fully (centralized) digitization of the currency is a dictators dream, there is a push towards a cashless society,
some countries in Europe are almost there, (I think they are not directly on the euro), I wonder who a decentralized cashless society is?
