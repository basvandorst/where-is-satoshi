I's more important than you think. 


It's important to factor the time period here. The world's economy is rapidly evolving. If you understood economy in 1970, before the emergence of the Internet, it doesn't mean you have any clue in 2018.

Benjamin Franklin has had a very good understanding of the economy of the 18th century (among other things, he was a very successful investor). 
It doesn't make him an expert in the digital economy of the 21th century. 
In the year 2018, the old farts like Soros and Buffett are not much better than Franklin. If they work in the very small field they're capable to understand, they still could be successful. Everything else (including the digital economy) is beyond their capabilities.

Some of them obviously don't understand it. See the utterly incompetent predictions by Krugman and Stieglitz.


There is only one way to check if you really understand something: go and apply your understanding in the real life. 
In the economics, a way to apply your knowledge is to try to make money on it. 
So, yes, a financially successful 18yr kid could have a better understanding of economy than some old fart who only has outdated theoretical knowledge.

Good question!
There is no such thing as the Nobel Prize in Economics.

The only robust way to distinguish between good economists and bad economists is to check their economic predictions. Every postdoc and his dog can create an economic theory. The important question is: does the theory apply to the real life? The Krugman's theories - do not (as his failure with the Internet indicates). 


I just made the list off the top of my head. If you think it's incomplete, please give me the info about other famous people, and I add them to the next version of the table.

I do. 
The important thing to understand is that training in economics (or any other science) is as valuable as it's applicable to the real life. 
A way to apply your understanding of economics to the real life is to make economic predictions. And if your predictions are wrong (like in the case Stiglitz vs Venezuela), your understanding is wrong too. 
Basic science...

The OP here. I think it's because some dips were counted several times. For example, the same dip could be counted in the 24h and in the 7d colum.
How I got the data:
1.  downloaded the csv from 
2. calculated the price change in % for each timeframe and each data point
3. created a column (D) where only dips are shown, using the following open office formula (C = percentage): =IF(C5&lt;0;-C5;"")
3. for each timeframe and data point, I checked if it's withing the percentage limits using the following open office formula (E2 and E3 - limits): =IF($D5="";"";IF(($D5&gt;=E$2) and ($D5&lt;E$3);1;""))  
4. counted the "1" for each timeframe and the dip category

USD works until it doesn't. Remember what happened to the first version of USD?

The biggest problem with USD is that it has a SPoF. A single political decision by Trump ("we'll print 100 trillion dollars to finance the bigly Wall!" or something equally stupid), and USD is dead.

Because the official title of the award is:

Wrong. The one who proposed the hypothesis must defend it, not the one who asked for the evidence. Otherwise you'll end up like whose theologians who are asking for the proof of the non-existence of God. 
But I'll provide my estimate nevertheless. 
Let's take only one use case for Bitcoin: an offshore account to hide your wealth. Cryprocurrencies are significantly better in this than traditional tax havens, so it's reasonable to assume that they'll take at least 50% of the sum currently hidden in offshore accounts. 
According to Forbes, about $21 trillion is stored in secretive offshore accounts. 
Therefore, the aggregate value of cryptos should be higher than $10 trillion. 
If we assume that the XBT dominance will remain to be above 30%, the aggregate value of Bitcoin should be higher than $3 trillion. 
Therefore, the fair/intrinsic/true value of 1 XBT is higher than 170 000 USD. And it's only one use case of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is extremely undervalued.  
And if something is extremely undervalued, it cannot be in a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:43:44
You're assuming that the whole Bitcoin community consists of identical people, which is obviously wrong. 
There are many people who are interested only in the price movements (too many for my taste). 
But there are also crypto-anarchists, libertarians, anarcho-capitalists etc. Most of them are early adopters who use Bitcoin not for making fast profit, but for ideological reasons. I'm one of them.

Every tech has its main use case. The main use case of Bitcoin is "moving money in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner". 
Do you need a decentralized and censorship-resistant system to pay for your coffee? If the answer is "yes", then you pay the fees. If the answer is "no", then use another system. 
In general, it's a bad idea to use a microscope to hammer a nail, or use on-chain Bitcoin transactions to pay for a cup of coffee. 
The future versions of Bitcoin could have an *additional* functionality (like LN) that allows very low fees and fast off-chain transactions. But cheap and fast transactions is not the main feature of Bitcoin. The freedom is the main feature of Bitcoin. And you need to pay for your freedom.

It's not easy, but it's definitely doable, especially in developed countries. 


I agree. In general, there is no good analogy to cryptocurrencies in traditional finances. It's an entirely new class of assets (if not a manifestation of a new *type of economy*). Many terms and concepts from traditional finances (for example, "speculative bubble") could be not applicable to it.

It's a common misconception that Bitcoin is only used for speculations. In fact, Bitcoin is one of the most popular *currencies* in the world. Millions of people use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services:


For international transactions, they're not. A Bitcoin transaction with appropriate fees is only 10 min. Such speed is unachievable in the traditional banking system. 
It's also important to remember that the core use case of Bitcoin is a non-governmental censorship-resistant currency. Bitcoin is excellent in it. 
Bitcoin could be used for buying your everyday food, selling cars etc, but it's not why Bitcoin was created. The current situation in Venezuela is a good illustration for *why*.

Bitcoin behaves more like a social network than a stock. 
The more people use Bitcoin, the more useful it is as a currency, the more valuable it is. 
For social networks, the growth in thousands % in value in a few years is typical. For example, compare the value of Facebook as a service in its first year and its fifth year.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:12:43


A Bitcoin transaction with a proper fee always takes no more than 10 min. You can choose to use a slower transaction (and pay less for it), but it's optional. 
There are some scaling problems, but they'll be mostly solved in the next few years with the widespread adoption of Segwit and LN. 
In general, the more people use Bitcoin, the more options they have how to spend and earn their coins, thus making the system more valuable for them. 
Exactly like Facebook: the more people are on Facebook, the better is the feed of the average user.

It's not about the purity of accepting Bitcoin directly (although it would be nice if more companies would do it). It's about the changing attitude towards Bitcoin among major companies. 
For many of them, even an indirect acceptance of Bitcoin is a huge step. And it's only the first step. Many of them will transition to the direct support of Bitcoin in the future.

If service X is significantly better than service Y, it's reasonable to expect that X will gain more users than Y over time. Not always true, but usually it is. 
Not sure about the estimated date of reaching 50%. But if this trend still exists, we'll reach 25% in less than 10 years:


The movements of wealth to/from classical off-shore accounts are significantly easier to track. See the Paradise Papers scandal etc. 
And more importantly: it's trivial for the Gov to expropriate the money from your bank account, but practically impossible to expropriate your cryptos (if you're doing it right). 
I predict that the majority of affluent people will use Bitcoin in a combination with Monero: easy to enter because of the Bitcoin mass adoption, easy to hide because of the Monero untraceability.
It's not a coincidence that countries like Switzerland and Malta have a friendly attitude towards cryptocurrencies. 


You can already buy houses and Lambos directly with Bitcoin. 
If my prediction about trillions of USD in the aggregate value is realistic, moving a few billions of USD in/out of crypto will not affect the price much. 


There are countries where the government itself is endorsing Bitcoin: 
* Antigua &amp; Barbuda (they plan to accept Bitcoin for government services) 
* Malta (the country has a national strategy for the adoption of blockchain and Bitcoin) 
* Mauritius (State Bank of Mauritius accepts Bitcoin as a loan collateral) 
* Switzerland (several municipalities are accepting Bitcoin for government services; a government-owned railway company sells bitcoins at its ticket machines) 
* Japan (officially recognized Bitcoin as a method of payment; the city of Hirosaki accepts Bitcoin donations) 
* Vanuatu (it's possible to officially buy their citizenship with Bitcoin). 


To destroy the Bitcoin network, a solar flare must permanently destroy the computers running the Bitcoin nodes / miners. It means, the flare should be powerful enough to destroy computers. It means, the flare of such power will destroy our entire modern civilization. The only wealth that will matter after it will be canned food and guns. 
 


If you want to store a few billions of USD long-term, does the volatility matter at all for you?
Say, you have $5 bln worth of Bitcoin today. In 2018 it will be 6 bln. In 2019 – 12 bln. In 2020 – 1 bln. In 2021 – 20 bln. 
Yes, it's changing over time. But who cares? You're still a billionaire, and your wealth is mostly going upwards.  


I agree, it's an important factor. The value of Bitcoin as a store of value will increase over time as it's becoming older – simply because the trust is a function of the age of the system.

I agree, the Palantir's work with the gov is a bad sign.
Although it's important to keep in mind that Thiel is a gifted chess player. And to win a chess game, you often need to make sacrifices.
For example, it's a good idea to collaborate with the Gov if the collaboration gives you the means to destroy it.
In the Thiel's case, the ultimate weapon could be seasteading. If you can get a few billions from the governmental contracts to finance the thing that makes the Gov irrelevant, then it must be done.

Bitcoin can support billions of users, even today, without SegWit etc.

@_date: 2017-02-18 06:15:52
Wrong. It actually happened:
The law, part of the Banking Act in 1959, allowed gold seizures of private citizens if the Governor determined it was “expedient so to do, for the protection of the currency or of the public credit of the Commonwealth.” In other words, they made it legal to seize gold from private citizens and exchange it for paper currency.
The country’s Treasurer stated in a press release that followed, “All gold (other than wrought gold and coins to a limited extent) had to be delivered to the Reserve Bank of Australia within one month of its coming into a person's possession.”
The law also said you weren’t allowed to sell gold, except to the Reserve Bank of Australia (their central bank). Nor could you export any gold (send it outside the country) without the bank’s permission.
While it is unclear whether or not the country moved ahead with active seizures, or just how many citizens complied, the law still destroyed the local private gold market overnight.

Only one political decision is needed to make it happen. 
If a country adopts Bitcoin as its second official currency, it will create a chain reaction, resulting in Bitcoin becoming the reserve currency in most of countries.  
Countries sometimes adopt currencies that they can't control (Euro in Serbia, USD in Zimbabwe etc). And an introduction of a second official currency does not require any big infrastructural changes. Quite possible.

Bitcoin can support billions of concurrent users, even without SegWit etc. The only problem is low median speed of transactions, but as long as it's faster than international bank transactions (~3 days), Bitcoin will be OK. And even with 1 year delays, it will still be more useful as a long-term store of value than gold. 
As for bans, there are about 200 countries in the world, and some of them explicitly declared their support of Bitcoin (see, for example, the recent news from the country of Georgia). As long as there is at least one country where usage of Bitcoin is not banned, Bitcoin will be OK.

We bought Ethereum, Dash and Monero. They are currently the   and  by the market capitalization.
Ethereum is a computational platform that could power the IoF and DAO revolutions.
Dash is a payment system like Bitcoin, but with an important twist: Dash is a financially self-sustained, auto-catalytically growing, democratic organization. It also has build-in instantaneous transactions, and a different hashing algorithm (X11).
Monero is probably the most anonymous among cryptocurrencies. Its underlying technology is not based on the Bitcoin blockchain. So, if something terrible happens to Bitcoin, Monero will not be affected.

The only thing that hard fork means is a creation of another alt-coin. 
It may cause some panic, but it will not affect the long-term value of Bitcoin.

I've noticed that there is a panic wave of enormous proportions in this sub. And, for some strange reason, most of the FUD-spreading users have new accounts, or never posted anything in this sub before. Also, shills. 
So, I decided to check how bad is the current situation in reality by asking two questions:
What does the market think about the current situation?
How bad is the current situation in comparrison with other crisis periods in the history of Bitcoin?
One can clearly see the answers on the chart:
 
The market thinks that Bitcoin is good and healthy, otherwise the price would be much lower. Moreover, the current situation is better than **98%** of the time in the history of Bitcoin, in spite of full blocks, high fees and other minor inconveniences.  
There is no crisis.

It looks like there is a strong correlation between the two. The more users, the bigger is the market cap. Although, it's kinda obvious.

TLDR: They need thousands of years to stole your money, even if they have all the energy produced by the humankind to power their hardware.   
Let's assume that the hardware of the pool is 100% energy-effective. Let's also assume that the hardware needs only 1 FLOP to check 1 address. Both assumptions are vastly exaggerated.  
According to LBC, they're doing 336.30 Mkeys/s. It means that the pool is doing no less than 336 MFLOPS. 
The Bitcoin mining is doing about 1 EFLOPS while consuming about 0,03% of energy produced by the humankind. If Bitcoin miners use 100% of energy produced in the world, it will give them about 3 ZFLOPS. 
So, imagine that LBC gets all the energy in the world. It will speed up their search 10^13 times.
According to LBC itself, the current probability to find an address with funds on it within the next 24h is about 0,00000000002%. With the described planetary computer, they'll find about 2 such addresses per day. But there are 25 million of addresses with funds. It means, to find a particular address (yours), they'll still need thousands of years, even with the planetary computer. 
If you're using it right, you Bitcoin wallet is still vastly safer than your bank account.

I think it's reasonable to assume that the major companies who accept Bitcoin are interested in the success of Bitcoin, and don't want to have legal troubles because they accept it. 
It's also likely that the top managers of these companies are interested in Bitcoin personally. You can't just put the word "Bitcoin" on your shiny international corporate site without discussing it with the CEO.
It means, they indeed may be interested in lobbying for Bitcoin. The existence of the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus is an evidence for it.

It sounds a bit strange, but we got a new all-time high. This time it's 30-day moving median. It's currently $1181,28 (As of 25th March)
Median is better than average, as it's less sensitive to volatility, and 30-day moving median is even less sensitive to it. So, it's a useful indicator if you want to ignore speculative perturbations, and calculate the "true" price.

US+EU+China represent 63% of the world GDP and 30% of the world population. And the vast majority of Bitcoiners (both actual and potential) are living there. Therefore, the political changes in the aforementioned countries have the strongest influence on the value of Bitcoin. 
Interestingly, the lower plot is almost identical to the upper plot for China (blue line). One possible explanation is that the majority of the capital invested in Bitcoin is from China.

I'm living entirely on Bitcoin, so I think I can evaluate the usability of Bitcoin as peer-to-peer cash myself. It's OK.
It's slower and more expensive than a few years ago, but still vastly better than banks if you need to move money.

In the case of a split, you'll have exactly the same amount of coins as before the split. And if you don't sell them, you'll preserve your wealth regardless of which version of Bitcoin wins. Bitcoin will remain an excellent long-term investment, regardless of splits. 
By selling Bitcoin, you has made a mistake. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:50:30
For example, you want to check if the panic on r/Bitcoin is justified or not. 
To do it, follow these steps:
1. Check the current price of Bitcoin in USD
2. In the left column ("Price") of the chart find the nearest price
3. Check the third column ("% of days"). It shows how bad is the current situation from the historical perspective. For example, if 98% of the time the price was lower than today, than the current situation is definitely not bad (in comparison with what we have had in the past). 
4. In the right column compare the severity of a historical crisis with the current situation. For example, is it today as bad as when all the major exchanges were DDOSed simultaneously in 2014? Probably not. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:00:22
I never claimed that my understanding of finances is good. Not my field of expertise. But I think we can both agree that €800 tsd is not enough to significantly change the price of Bitcoin these days. Especially if you consider the fact that it was not bought in one peace and not in one day.

Yes, as a step towards the economy without governmental regulations. 
Anyway, libertarians are not promising a crisis-free economy (although libertarian policies do reduce their frequency).

Using the same argument, you could conclude that the process of picking your nose is regulated by Government. 
On a more serious note, you can indeed buy, sell and use Bitcoin without coming across any regulations at all. You can meet a local Bitcoiner and buy/sell anything you want for Bitcoin. And if you're really paranoid, you can even do it without the Internet - using physical Bitcoins. If you can't enforce regulations, they exist only on paper.

About a week ago I posted a similar map, but with narrow money vs Bitcoin only. People liked it, and some asked to make a new version, with broad money and all crypto. Here we go!
Sources of the data:
* 
* 
The first source defines "Broad money" as "the total quantity of time and savings deposits, held by nonbank financial institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy" + M1 money (notes and coins in circulation, traveler's checks, demand deposits, other checkable deposits). 
So, it's pretty much a sum of everything we call "money". 
One could argue that it's just a bunch of dirt-poor countries, and it's an easy task to overcome them on such metric. But the interesting thing is, it's 34% of all countries in the world, combined! 
When Bitcoin hits $40 000 (and the rest of the crypto market follows), it will be 65% of all countries combined.

Great entrepreneurs are great because they make rational decisions, and being risk-averse is not rational.

* Second option: with 100% probability you'll get 0.1 XBT.
An entrepreneur will choose the first option in almost any situation, a risk-averse person will choose the second option.

I wholeheartedly agree. For some people, even on this sub, the idea of living on Bitcoin sounds like madness. They don't understand that in a few decades Bitcoin (and other crypto) will be the only hard currency, and millions of people will live without fiat.

How the map was made:
To create a list of the countries where both Bitcoin debit cards and Bitcoin-to-wire services are available, I used the information about availability from 
the Xapo and Bitwala sites. 
I also added the US and Philipines to the list (because they have other services with a similar functionality). 
The map is far from complete. I'm sure there are other countries where you can survive living on Bitcoin too. 
Corrections, requests and comments are welcome!

The experience you gain as an entrepreneur during crisis times translates very nicely into the political world.
An entrepreneur who has successfully outlived several bankruptcies will be a better president than any person who don't have such experience (all other things being equal).

There are 2 factors to consider for a long-term storage of any information:
*  the quality of the storage of the info
* the number of the copies of the info
The second one is vastly more important. If the risk of losing one copy of the info is 10%,  the risk of losing two copies is 1%, five copies - 0,001%.
The solution is to make several backups of the seed, using several different methods (paper, hardware), and store them in geographically separated secure locations. Leave you daughter instructions how to obtain and use the seeds (say, in your testament).

It's a very big change. To do it safely, we need some real-life testing and a lot of time. 
The best real life testing? Alt-coins. For example, litecoin will implement it soon.
Let's see how it'll work for them. Maybe someone could find exploits etc. 
I think major pools are doing exactly this: waiting for the results of the real world testing on alt-coins.

Yep, the infrastructure of the NATO, Russia and China will be pretty much destroyed. But some countries will survive untouched, especially the remote ones like Island, New Zealand, and many in Oceania and Africa.

According to this site, Segwit will start signalling on the 28th of Janurary, 2017

Strongly depends on the status of Bitcoin in your country. In some countries it's a currency, in others - commodity, nonmonetary mean of exchange, private money etc etc. In other countries in doesn't have any legal status.
I think in most countries you don't need to pay any taxes if you buy pizza with such card.

Not necessarily.
Firstly, It's possible to pay for rent directly in Bitcoin. Although such housings are not available in every city.
Secondly, you can convince you employer and house owner to use Bitcoin. Not many agree, but some do.
Thirdly, you can buy an apartment with Bitcoin. For many people it's a better option than paying rent.
Anyway, even if your wages and rent are in Euro, it's still makes sense to use Bitcoin. It gives you more Independence from government, and this advantage alone is worth the fees. Other advantages : better privacy (if you're doing it right), protection against mad monetary policies ala Venezuela, helping Bitcoin to grow.
By the way, it's less than 5% in total fees.

They think they control Bitcoin (because a lot of miners and trade volumes are in China).
If they think that Bitcoin will play a major role in the world economy,  it's in their own interest to keep Bitcoin alive and prospering (as long as they have the means to influence it). 
China is trying to be as economically pragmatic as possible, and banning Bitcoin is not pragamitic in long-term.

Your biggest problem is that you think that a government-controlled agency with prohibitory powers is the only possible solution. It is not. 
There are developed countries without FDA-like agencies. Moreover, the FDA itself is very recent invention. In the first half of the 20th century in the US drugs were practically unregulated. In spite of it, Americans enjoyed a very high life expectancy, almost as high as today, and higher than the rest of the world at the time.

The most important thing about the Gold vs Bitcon discourse is that they're both competing for the same "safe haven" position, and Gold is slowly losing. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:15:30
The price strongly depends on the things that are almost impossible to predict. So, it's better to speak not about the future price, but about possible scenarios. 
Scenario  "Business as usual". Some small bubbles and crashes, but adoption is steadelly rising, and there are no big political changes. Price: $2 000 - $3 000
Scenario  "Crash". Something really bad happens to Bitcoin, and it's not useful anymore. A repaired version is eventually made. It's price: $10 - $200
Scenario  "To the Moon". Something good happens to Bitcoin. For example, some country adopts it as a reserve currency or even as the second national currency, causing a huge wave of adoption internationally. Price: $100 000 and higher.
I would say that the probability of the first scenario is about 80%, second - 5%, and third - 15%.

On-chain scaling and mass adoption are incompatible (by the nature of the blockchain technology). It means, unless we implement off-chain scaling, the fees will continue to grow, and the number of use cases for Bitcoin will decrease over time. 
it's true regardless of your position on Segwit or big blocks.

@_date: 2017-01-05 09:01:21
Well, my prediction is more conservative than "Gold will surely still have financial value in 1,000 years".
It's like "Microsoft shares will have financial value in 1,000 years" VS "Technological progress will destroy Microsoft far earlier". The second prediction is more conservative. The first one needs some serious arguments. 
In general, there is no such thing as a future-proof tech. Stone hammers were used for several million (!) years. But we don't use them anymore, because technological progress made them obsolete. 
The same thing did happen with seashells (they played the same role as gold today for tens of thousands of years). The same thing will happen with gold. And with Bitcoin. And with the successor of Bitcoin.

Fundamental human rights (like the right to bear arms) exist regardless of the fact that your country is trying to limit them. They're not _granted_ by Government. You was born with them.
If the laws of your country are limiting the right to bear arms, then such laws must be abolished and the politicians who supported them must be dethroned and jailed. The same story with the violations of the castle doctrine.
And if your country is limiting fundamental human rights, it's a police state. Even if your goventment is killing fewer citizens than the North Korea, and more freedom of speech is allowed than in China.

5% is an example. We can set it to 0.5% or 0.05% or whatever. By the way, some people are already doing a similar thing: if you use the Miltibit wallet, a very small percent of your transaction is going to the developers. I'm ok with it.

Bitcoin is now bigger than ~70% of all national currencies!
Next targets in our world conquest: 
* PHILIPPINES - $66 bln
* ISRAEL - $73 bln
* VIETNAM - $75 bln
If we consider the total aggregate value of all crypto ($121 bln), we are already above the UK, Brazil and Turkey (among others).    
Although, there is still a long way to go. To get into the top 20, we need a $217 bln market cap. And to conquer the US, we need $200k per coin.

There are two types of bitcoin cards.
 The first type works as follows: 1) you transfer coins to a special address. 2) When you need to use the card, you click "load" and your coins are converted into euros which you can spend with your card.
The second one convert your coins into euros automatically from your wallet each time you use the card according to the current exchange rate.
Cryptopay is the first type, Xapo is the second type.
I think the second one is better for me.
The probability of bitcoin becoming worthless is smaller than euro or dollar becomming worthless. But diversification is the key: never store your money in one place. Store a part of it in other strong crypto (ether, Monero, dash), gold, arms, stocks etc

There are several levels of living on bitcoin - from avoiding to own fiat to dealing only with bitcoiners.I would recommend checking out the link posted below for the further info.

There is no reason to keep all your savings in bitcoin. Diversification is the key.
But you indeed can live entirely on bitcoin

You also can valuate things in sea shells. Some tribes still do it, and it's practical for them.
@_date: 2016-12-10 06:49:34
So, there are basically 5 levels of crypto-maximalism:
1. Not using Bitcoin at all.
2. Buying stuff only with fiat money, Bitcoin is only an investment
3. Buying stuff only with a Bitcoin debit card and, if possible, directly with Bitcoin 
4. Buying stuff only from merchants who accept Bitcoin (Bitcoin processing services are allowed)
5. Buying stuff only from merchants who have a real Bitcoin wallet (no all4btc, no Edeka etc) to avoid conversion into fiat 
I'm currently on the level  you're - on the level  The ideal is the level

I'm a crypto-maximalist too (I'm currently in the process of transition to living exclusively on Bitcoin). 
The problem is, most people can't pay with BTC wallets only. My grandma can't do it. But she could use a Bitcoin card. 
The main driver of a wide Bitcoin adoption are not merchants, but average people. The more people use Bitcoin, the more merchants will accept it, not the other way around. And Bitcoin cards is a way to make average people use Bitcoin.

"2030: Joking, aren't you? These days you can buy a country for a few thousands of satoshis"

For example, imagine a system where every person has 1 unique wallet, and no one can have more than 1. Each time someone makes a transaction, 5% of the coins is going to a random participant of the system. 
If enough people are participating, everyone will get a substantial unconditional income, without governmental enforcement. 
The biggest problem is to find a method of making the "one wallet - one person" part. There are already some solutions, but more research is needed. 
Current monthly Bitcoin transaction volume is about $6 bln. If we assume that 10 mln people are participating in the system, everyone will get about $600 per month on average.

As for keeping assets, it's a bit more complex. Bitcoin is not gold, it's more like facebook: the more people use it, the more valuable is the system, the stronger it is.
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:10:26
I agree, there is nothing special it. Basically, it's just a simplified process of converting Bitcoins into Euros. Still, I like how the role of fiat currency is downgraded in such system - from the only "real" money (as it was before Bitcoin) to an optional technical tool (now).   
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:48:34
It depends. If you use a Bitcoin debit card, you can buy everything you can buy with a Visa, without any unnecessary complications.

1. Reduce the "tax" to 0.01% GST or any other very small value
2. Tell you that it's good for community, and it's a kind of financial insurance for you.
By the way, there is no need to convince every single person on Earth to participate. Yes, the more people - the better, but the system will work even in a small community like a town. 
If the people of the town are happy with the system, they'll convince other people to participate, and the system will grow.

It's better currency than GBR if you're using it right. Especially for AnCaps like me.
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:59:42
One of the biggest problems with the typical UBI proposals is the involvement of Government. It's very dangerous, as Government will get immense financial powers over its citizens. The state-less UBI doesn't have this problem.
And for the ideal state-less UBI you need some distributed and decentralized financial system like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:32:43
In the long term, there are only two paths for them:
* adopt Bitcoin (or some other strong crypto). The South Korea and Switzerland are already doing it.
* end up like Venezuela, with hyperinflation amplified by the outflow of the capital into Bitcoin, the ultimate safe haven.
We'll see the natural selection of governments, and their survival will depend on their adoption of crypto.
By the way, the UK will probably choose the second path (judging by the internet censorship laws and other signs of a slow descend into a dictatorship). Combine it with a severe economical shortsightedness (Brexit), the rise of nationalism, and the imminent death of the de jure country ruler, and you'll get a perfect recipe for a large-scale political/financial disaster.
 I would recommend emigration.

Great work with Bitpay, thank you guys!
My question: 
Bitpay has de facto the biggest database of merchants who accept Bitcoin in the world. Do you plan to implement some sort of catalog of merchants? Could be a massive advantage over your competition AND a boost for your merchants.
Like, I want to buy some pizza. I open the app and it shows me the list of the nearest bitpay merchants who sell pizza for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:54:42
it's a Visa (I don't like it too). But there is a good thing about the whole schema: fiat money is only a intermediary. The input is my bitcoins. The output is groceries. I don't see and don't touch fiat money. For most practical purposes, it's indeed a "Bitcoin card". 


It works as follows: I transfer coins to a special address (say, once a year), click the "load" button, and it's done. 
It would be cool to have some more straightforward system - without visas, conversions etc. But, unfortunately, we're still some years away from it. 
I personally will use the card only for the things I can't directly buy with Bitcoin (like groceries).

Just made this map to find out which countries are better prepared to the Bitcoin future. 
There are some problems with the map. The data from CoinAtmRadar is not complete, and in some cases it's not clear what we should consider as a "Bitcoin ATM". Also, some countries have not many BTMs, but have a very strong Bitcoin economy (for example, Philippines). The chosen indicator is not very robust. Are there better indicators for comparing "Bitcoin preparedness" of countries? Dunno.

Probably the only robust way to mitigate this risk is to use some parallel distributed physical network not connected to the Internet.

If the rate is, say, above 10% in your country, it's a good indicator of a severe incompetence of the rulers of the country. As they can't suddenly become competent, expect other idiotic financial decisions from them.

 Crypto != deflation. For example, Monero is inflationary by design (although the inflation is small and predictable). By the way, a very promising crypto. 
"We don't have hyperinflation right now" != "we'll never have it". A single governmental decision can create it ( as people of Venezuela learned it the hard way). Not sure about the UK, but in many countries a single  beurocrat or a small group of them can decide to start hyperinflation, without any parliamentary approval.

There are 4 important practical advantages of living on Bitcoin:

Fidor is an international bank that operates in Germany and the UK. It's a subsidiary of Groupe BPCE, the France's second largest bank.
In general, most banks are rather sceptical about Bitcoin, and many of them are closing accounts associated with crypto.

This kind of banks have a chance of survival, unlike government-controlled central banks and Bitcoin-hating banksters.

The problem is, CPU exploits do exist already (for example, Intel's Management Engine). But no Bitcoin-related vulnerabilities in them yet, as far as I know. 
On the other hand, zero-day exploits of popular open-source software are rather rare. Especially if it's a safety-critical software like Bitcoin, and especially if anyone can use those hypothetical exploits to steal $billions.

The usage of Windows XP indicates how outdated most of them are. 
Remember how a few months ago a vulnerability in the old versions of Windows has crippled the NHS in the UK? 
The quantum breakthrough will have a similar effect on many banks (especially state-owned banks - the most outdated ones). 
The trust in the current banking system is directly related with the trust in the fiat currency. 
Do you know what will happen when most people will unable to withdraw their funds from the crippled banking system? There are several historical examples. In all of them the value of fiat currency has rapidly approached zero.

Good questions!
To estimate the possible damage, I sorted all attacks into 3 categories:
* low damage: short-term price perturbations; full recovery in a few weeks
* medium damage: some slowdown of adoption; long-term future not affected
* massive damage: major upgrade needed to outlive the attack 
To estimate the risks, I've learned about the history of the previous attacks, and the current state of affairs. 
Although I did my best to objectively estimate them, both estimates are nothing more but my humble opinions, of course. It's a good idea to take them with a grain of salt.

One of the most frequent mistakes newbies make is assuming that Bitcoin behaves like a stock. Bitcoin is not a stock. 
As CME's Melamed (and other pros) correctly pointed out, Bitcoin is an entirely new asset class. Its behavior often can't be described with the terminology that is used for traditional assets. This includes the term “bubble”. 
If you want to understand why the value of Bitcoin is growing, try to perceive it as a social network. The more people use it, the more valuable is the network, and its value is growing roughly proportional to the square of the number of the users (Metcalfe's law). A social network at the early stages of its development could experience an exponential growth in value. Bitcoin is such a network.

No blockchain-based decentralized currency can scale without the second layer. It's technically impossible - because you either need to replace blockchain with something else or sacrifice decentralization.

A short history of uranium:
* Before 1945: Uranium is a small niche product with very limited applications. It's mostly used to produce yellow glass and photographic chemicals. 
* 1945: “the Moon event”: atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A hell lot of people now know about it, and demand for uranium will grow exponentially for the next 12 years, mostly driven by “institutional investors” (in the case of uranium – by the US gov). 
* 1948: a new important use case - nuclear reactors. 
* 1958: The first UN-level regulation of the tech (International Atomic Energy Agency). 
* 1963 onwards: the adoption is growing, mostly driven by popular demand (civil nuclear power).

There are several dozens countries in the world who choose to do exactly that - to use a currency that they don't directly control. For example, the Eurozone. It's indeed possible. And, judging by the Eurozone, it's practical (well, unless your politicians are Greek) 


There are many benefits of Bitcoin as a currency. For example, it's deflationary (and, contrary to the popular misconception, it's a good thing).

I explicitly mentioned the fact that Valve ceased to accept Bitcoin (see the "changes in the 2018" section). 
Some companies start to accept it, some companies stop to accept it, nothing wrong about about it, as Bitcoin is not for every company yet. The good thing is, the total number of accepting companies is growing. 


You're repeatedly comparing Bitcoin with companies. Bitcoin is not a company. It's a currency. 
This is what you'll see if you compare it with other currencies (notice the percentages on the right):

As a person who is living on Bitcoin, I agree with your sentiment. In general, it's a good idea to price everything in BTC, including prices of consumer goods, trade volumes etc. 
But these graphs were made for the general audience, and values in USD are more accessible for them. 
Another way would be to replace USD on the first graph with the number of housings you can buy with such sum or something like this. 
An average California housing costs $440 000. The yearly transaction volume, measured in such units:
2010	- 1
2011	- 492
2012	- 688
2013	- 16897
2014	- 26040
2015	- 30241
2016	- 65826
2017	- 428686
So, in the 2017, the value of a half-million of California housings was traded using Bitcoin.  
Assuming that there are 2 people on average living in one housing, with this amount of money you can buy every single housing in San Francisco.

If you're using an escrow service (like Bitrated), the buyer's protection for Bitcoin is actually stronger than for Mastercard. If you're doing it right, merchant can't screw you. 


Many people don't understand that the Bitcoin's transaction times are actually the *user's choice*. You choose how fast you want your transaction to be confirmed - by choosing the fees. 
Regardless of how congested is the mempool, you can get your transaction in 10 min or less (if you selected the high enough fee). You're paying for the speed.

I partially agree with you. To be absolutely honest, we need to consider 3 different time periods:
* the time to transact a verifiable intent to purchase the product 
* the time to wait till receiving the purchased product
* the time to wait till the transaction is actually complete
The first one is less than a few seconds for both systems (swiping the card / sending the payment request).
The second one is a few seconds for Mastercard and variable for Bitcoin (depends on how many confirmations the merchant wants -
- from 0 to 6 or more). 
The third one is less than a hour for Bitcoin and about 6 months for Mastercard.

Actually, it's equally easy to find some data in Pi and on blockchain. 
To find something in Pi, you just need two numbers: the first digit of the data, and the length of the data. For example, "1 - 4" will return "1415". 
The hard part is to put something in Pi:) You'll need a hell lot of computational resources to identify the position of some particular file in Pi. But after you got the position, you can easily transmit and recover it. 
The (in)practicability of using Pi to transmit porn doesn't change the situation: banning Bitcoin because someone can use it for porn is as idiotic as banning Pi. 
By the way, if Pi is indeed a "normal number", you can find the whole Bitcoin blockchain in it.

I use the following reasoning to determine the winner in this case:
If someone predicts that I have between 100 and 200 apples, and I have 199 apples, then he correctly predicted the future. If someone predicts that I have 201 apples, his prediction is not as good as the first one, even if his forecast was very close to the actual amount.
Only if both price ranges are correct, only then we compare who is the closest, who has the narrowest range etc. But in our case, only one price range is correct (by 101111). He's the winner.

There are alternative dispute resolution mechanisms already in place. For example, private courts of arbitration. 
Basically, if two entities disagree, they choose a private court they both trust (often - _before_ any dispute, at the stage of finalizing a contract agreement).  And if they can't resolve the dispute by a direct negotiation, they ask the trusted court to do it.
It's not just some theoretical possibility. International companies (and sometimes - even states) are already resolving their disputes in such way. 
The enforcement of the court decision could be done by locking the funds using a multisig wallet, for example. Something like Bitrated is doing:

Not anymore. 
For example, we have a deal: you'll wash my dishes, and I'll pay you 0.1 XMR.  
As it's technically impossible to track transactions in Monero, our deal will remain anonymous as long as we don't talk about it. You'll get your money, and no state, no regulation and no authority will be able to stop you from receiving or using it. 
The state could try to fight it (for example, by banning business from accepting anonymous crypto), but it's futile. As long as the Internet exists, there will be anonymous crypto, and people will use it to trade with each other.  
Libertarians, anarcho-capitalists and cypherpunks already won this war. Today, money is de facto stateless (as it should be).  


Meanwhile, in most developed countries, Lyft and Uber operate without any obstacles, making the outdated taxi licenses and regulations obsolete. Why? Because Uber is cheaper, faster and better than licensed taxis, and *voters* love it. 


Yes, it's a popular idea among statists. it's also wrong and dangerous:
	


It's important to understand that every human has fundamental human rights and freedoms. These rights and freedoms are not *granted* by the society or the constitution, but you have them from your birth. They include the right to live, the right to bear arms and other rights and freedoms. 
You can voluntarily limit your rights (for example, by leaving at home your assault riffle if you go to a gun-free restaurant). But no one can limit your rights without your explicit agreement. 
If the Gov or any other entity is trying to limit your rights (for example, by introducing gun regulations), you exercise your right of self-defense. 
For example, by politely reminding the dictator that you have an assault riffle, and if they don't stop trying to limit your freedoms, you'll use it.

I've made it for fun. Also to demonstrate how futile it's to ban Bitcoin: as long as you're able to transmit a picture, you can use Bitcoin, regardless of how strict are the laws and how powerful are the firewalls. 
You can even automate the process: for example, assign a specific cat picture to every byte. Post some cat pictures on Instagram. On the other side, the cat pictures are converted back to bytes, and you have a Bitcoin transaction. 
As long as the Internet is not completely blocked, it's impossible to ban Bitcoin.

If you understand Bitcoin, you'll agree that all functions of the Chinese government (starting with the monetary ones) can be replaced by decentralized stateless systems.

The central government itself killed more people than all rebellions combined. And in every rebellion against the Gov, there is the Gov that caused the rebellion by its own incompetence. No Gov - no deadly rebellions against it. 


Wrong. There is a mass support for it because Chinese are brainwashed 24/7. Moreover, it's done openly and officially (there are official governmental structures who are doing propaganda etc).


Libertarianism has no nationality, and it's indeed universal. If you agree that people should not be killed or robbed by the Gov, you're a libertarian. 
The problem is, some nations are not educated enough to understand that the Gov is killing/robbing them, and that there is no actual need for a central Gov (or any Gov at all).

* It looks like the number of Bitcoin users in the US and Germany is growing significantly slower than the number of people who know about Bitcoin. Most Americans and Germans who could become Bitcoiners are already Bitcoiners. 
* Judging by the incomplete data we have here, 1-9% of the population in Western countries are Bitcoiners. 
* About 9% of Americans are using Bitcoin. It's 29 million of Bitcoiners in the US alone. There are more Bitcoiners in the US than the population of Texas. 
* More on the 9%: less than 5% of Americans use marijuana, and less than 2% of them are libertarians. It means, a significant portion of Bitcoiners are primarily using it for doing legal and apolitical stuff. It's now a currency of the regular folk too:) 
* A significant portion of the population in Western countries agrees that crypto is the future of money (10-50%). About 5% of them are hardcore Bitcoiners who think that Bitcoin will replace fiat in 10 years. 
* 58 million of Americans are interested in using Bitcoin instead of USD. It's like the combined population of California + New York.

* the biggest and the most competent dev team
* the most secure network 
* the most decentralized network
* the highest adoption among merchants and users
* the most advanced infrastructure (hardware wallets, ATMs etc) 
* Bitcoin is one of only few 3-gen cryptos: 
* the reputation of Bitcoin as the reserve currency in the world of crypto. People are often trying to make money on other coins, but if they want a long-term store of value, they use Bitcoin.  
Sure, it's possible that a more advanced crypto could emerge. But to compete with Bitcoin, you need a lot more than a better tech.

A price point would win if no one provided a price range around the real price. In such case, if the real price is $5000 and someone predicted $5001, then he'll win. 


I expected at least a hundred answers. With so many answers, "$1 to $9000000000" will definitely lose as many people will give narrower ranges. 
Anyway, if you think that my competition was badly organized, feel free to organize a better one yourself, with any rules you like. It's easy: make a reddit post with the rules and provide some monetary prize of your choice.

Not sure about it. 
Bitcoin is becoming more scarce over time (because people sometimes lose their private keys). It's possible that the current issuance of new coins is compensating for this loss. But after most coins will be issued, we'll see a constant decrease of the number of bitcoins in circulation. 
Therefore, even after every single human on the planet will become a Bitcoiner, the value of 1 Bitcoin will continue to grow.  
We can estimate the upper bound of the loss rate using this data: 
In 2015, the total amount of bitcoins that have never been spent was about 14% of all bitcoins. So, the loss rate should be below 3% per year, which is below the current Bitcoin inflation rate. 
We're probably several halvings away from the described situation.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:20:19
I use the following reasoning: 
If someone predicts that I have between 100 and 200 apples, and I have 199 apples, then he's correct. If someone predicts that I have 201 apples, he's not correct, even if his forecast was very close to the actual amount.

For every single nanny-state law you can find a country where no such law exist. 
It indicates that none of them ere required for civilization or functional society. 
 It's also important to distinguish between: 
* useful rules that protect people from bad circumstances (e.g. "you're not allowed to jaywalk on my private road because I hate to clean it up from corpses")
* nanny-state rules that are created to protect people from their own mistakes (e.g. "you're not allowed to use Bitcoin because you could lose money")
If you've made a bad investment in a fake ICO, it's your and only your fault. You should learn from your mistake, even if it means losing money. 
A regulation that bans ICOs because some people could lose money - is exactly the kind of a nanny-state regulation that should not exist. It limits the freedoms of citizens "for their own good".

My goal was to design a card game that is 1) fun to play, 2) more or less realistic about the balance of power in the Bitcoin space (as far as it’s possible in a simple card game).
It’s a work in progress. Comments, suggestions, criticism are welcome.  
Basic rules: 
To play the game, you need one physical coin and at least 3 copies of each card (just print the image 3 times). 
At the start of the game, each player gets 2 random cards. Cards are played openly. 
Every turn, each player plays 1 card. 
There are two ways to win the game:
* “The adoption victory”: acquire all User and Merchant cards 
* “The obliteration victory”: force the other player(s) to lose all their cards.
“Spawning” a card means taking the corresponding card from the deck. 
“Enticing” a card means stealing the card from another player. 
“Destroying” a card means returning the card to the deck.

Good point. Without a rigorous correlation/time series/factor analysis no such diagram could be convincing. Still could be useful as a part of a preliminary or exploratory research. 
For example, if you make such diagram for an altcoin vs Bitcoin, and the line for altcoin is two orders of magnitude higher than the line for Bitcoin, you have a good reason to suspect that the altcoin is overvalued, and plan your further investment research accordingly.

It's simple: the majority of people who are calling themselves "Bitcoin users" in the polls don't use standalone Bitcoin wallets. Instead, their coins are stored by Coinbase, exchanges and various web wallets. 
It's similar to the situation with fiat: you *think* you have US Dollars on your credit card, but in reality you only have an IOU from the bank, and zero actual dollars. 
It's a sad situation, but one can live with it. Coinbase etc are doing a good job of attracting new people, and some of them will become real Bitcoin users.

I absolutely agree with it. But it's also possible that some gov will officially adopt Bitcoin before it becomes a de facto currency in the country. 


There is a popular misconception about the size of the average/median national currency, especially in the developed countries with hundreds of millions of citizens (like the US). People imagine that all national currencies are as massive as USD or EUR. 
In fact, more than 50% of all countries in the world have less than **6 mln** citizens, and most of them have their own currencies. 
It means, the typical national currency has only a few millions of active users (1-2 orders of magnitude less than Bitcoin), and the daily number of their transactions are of the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin still has a long way before it surpasses USD, but it's already bigger than the majority of all currencies in the world. Simply because most national currencies are very small. 


You can say the same thing about any currency: the vast majority of all transactions are made by speculators (think high frequency trading on Forex etc).  


99.9% of all stores in the world don't accept the Pakistani rupee, in spite of the fact that it's the 6th most popular currency by the number of users.

Forbes / blockchain capital: "I own/have owned Bitcoin total 2%"

To summarize it:
**Adoption**: there are significantly more users and merchants today than 1 and 2 years ago. There is no doubt that adoption is growing, and growing fast. 
**Store of value**: the volatility is not decreasing. Nonetheless, Bitcoin remains to be an excellent store of value. 
**Bitcoin vs other cryptos**: the crypto space as a whole is becoming bigger than Bitcoin in the terms of the aggregate value. But Bitcoin remains to be the  crypto.  
**Bitcoin vs national currencies**: Bitcoin is now one of the biggest currencies worldwide, both by the aggregate value and the number of users. It's still tiny in in the terms of the volume and dominance, but both metrics show significant growth. 
**Politics**: the world is becoming more divided on what to do with Bitcoin: both the number of haters and fans are growing among governments. There is a growing number of influential political parties who support Bitcoin. 
**Tech**: thanks to the massive upgrades of the past year, transactions are now both cheaper and faster than before, while providing some new features like atomic swaps.

Some observations:
A. These days, Bitcoin has more use cases than a few years ago. Most of them are now more practical. 
B. The main exceptions are the use cases that involve moving very small amounts of money on-chain. 
C. There were 3 periods in the history of Bitcoin: 
1. "infancy" (2009): ~0 fees, but a third of use cases were impossible
2. "childhood" (2010-2012): low fees, almost all use cases were possible, but most of them were impractical (for various reasons)
3. "adolescence" (2013-2015): medium fees, a few use cases were better off-chain
4. "adulthood" (2016-): on-chain transactions are for moving large amounts of money and settlements. Bitcoin is a mature tech with a rich ecosystem and a lot of practical applications.

Interesting idea. Possible indeed. 
Although there is a strong counterargument: China plays a very strong role in Bitcoin - both in mining and in production of miners. 
Maybe Bitcoin was created not by the FBI, but by its Chinese counterpart. Or maybe even in a cooperation between the two.
Still more probable is creation of Bitcoin by some non-governmental agency or even a lone independent researcher. In 2009, no one expected the stellar rise of Bitcoin in 2017. It was simply impossible to predict.

Feel free to short Bitcoin. If you indeed have the working crystal ball, you can make some good money on it! 


Nope. You don't lose if you don't sell below the buy price. Most people consider Bitcoin as a long-term investment, thus they don't care about short-term price fluctuations.

The more they buy, the higher will be the price. They also can't but a massive load of bitcoin in one piece - because even the biggest exchanges can sell only a few $millions worth of Bitcoin per day.  
The Fed: "we want to buy 10 000 000 BTC with our monopoly money"
Exchanges: "Nope. We only have 100 000 BTC at any given day"
The Fed: "Ok, fine. We'll buy everything you have"
Exchanges: "Yay! We'll sell for $2000 a piece"
HODLers: "The demand is rising! HODL! No sell unless it's $20 000 a piece"
The next day:
The Fed: "we want to buy more coins"
Exchanges: "$20 000 a piece please"
And so on. 
The end result: USD is worthless, HODLers are filthy rich, the Fed is no more.

The US system is still too regulated. For example, the FDA is killing more people than it saving because of regulations. 
And international competition (from drug manufacturers to clinics) is pretty much barred from the US market because of regulations. The Shkreli scandal was a direct result of it. 
It‘s also important to note that the US is one of the richest countries by any measure. Your father is making more money than 95% people in the world, even if he’s has an average American income. In rich countries people usually pay more for the same thing.

The problem is, no one knows the real figure. Thus, no one knows if the lower estimate is several times away from it. We use that we have. 


I've explicitly mentioned both Dell and Edeka as the companies that stopped to accept Bitcoin (in the lower part of the diagram). I also categorized Edeka as "only a franchisee... accepts Bitcoin". So, we're both right in these two cases.  
About Alza:
I just checked it myself, they still have the Bitcoin option on Alza.cz. You need to click "Vsechny druhy plateb" button on the check-out to see the option. 
As for the size of the company: thanks for the hint! I'll exclude Alza from the 2017 stats. Hopefully, they'll have &gt;$1bln in the 2018, as they were very close to it in the 2017.


I encourage people to check and review my works (it's one of the reasons why I share them). So, if you find some errors in my data, please let me know, and I correct them in the next version of the diagram. I re-post the new and updated versions once a year or so.

Depends on the amount of transactions. 
If there are 100x more transactions than today, and 90% of them are off-chain, than we'll still have 10x more on-chain transactions than today.

There is a better and more objective metric: life expectancy. Healthy people live longer, and the quality of health care system is the major contributor to you health - especially in the old age. 
Switzerland (no NHS, less regulations, but a rich country): **83.4**
UK (NHS): **81.2**
US (no NHS, but a lot of fat people): **79.3**
Worldwide: **71.0**
Conclusion: it's possible to build an effective health care system using different approaches. The NHS is not the only effective way to do it. 
As the NHS is obviously a morally wrong way to do it (as it's based on state tyranny), another way is needed. For example, the way of the US or the way of Switzerland.

Bitcoin don't need to have fast transactions and low fees to gain mainstream popularity. 
It's extremely hard and expensive to move gold, yet it has mainstream popularity. It's popular because it's stateless, decentralized and weakly correlated with other assets. And Bitcoin is better in each of these properties.

Bitcoin has scaled to +16 millions users. 
if/when Ethereum achieved the user base of such size, will it have lower fees? Unlikely.

There is a truism: other cryptos have low fees not because they're better than Bitcoin, but because fewer people use them. It looks like the data confirms it. 
Yes, number of reddit readers is hardly a robust measure, but it's objective and easily measurable. And a huge difference in readers between two currencies almost certainly means a huge difference in active users.  
Unfortunately, I was unable to find the _median_ transaction fees for most currencies. The median would be a better measure. 
If someone finds it (especially the historical data for Bitcoin), I'll make the new version of this diagram with medians. 
The medians that I've found: 
Bitcoin - 5.72 USD, 
Monero - 0.54, 
Ethereum - 0.04 (not sure if this one is correct)

Some observations:
* By both measures, the current bull run is among the longest and largest in the history of Bitcoin. 
* It's realistic to expect a 70% increase in price (=$3 000 before the correction)
* If we're lucky, we'll have a 2000% increase, as it was in 2011 (= $23 000 before the correction)
Of course, no one knows the future, and predictions based on past performance are often wrong. But it shows as reasonable possibilities.

As a person who is trying to be as rational as possible, I like to invent scenarios that could test and challenge my beliefs. 
For example, I don't believe that aliens visited our planet. But if some reputable scientist publishes a paper in "Nature" about it, I'll change my mind. Another example: I believe in biological evolution, but if they find a [precambrian rabbit]( I'll change my mind. 
For Bitcoin, I'll use the following test: 
*if the price fell below $1 (in the 2010 dollars), and remained below $1 for one year or more, then I was wrong about Bitcoin. Bitcoin was indeed a failed experiment.* 
Which hypothetical scenario would challenge your beliefs about Bitcoin? 
Say, if Malta adopts Bitcoin as a reserve currency, would it change your mind?
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:34:04
A world-wide ban of Bitcoin is highly unlikely. Some far more controversial tech is not banned worldwide (like cluster bombs or human cloning). 
Moreover, some governments openly embrace Bitcoin: Malta, Georgia, some local governments in Switzerland and Japan. Others have declared that they will not regulate Bitcoin: 
Therefore, a ban is not the most realistic reason why Bitcoin could crash. Even if we ignore the fact that governmental bans in general are notoriously ineffective and often have the opposite effect (the infamous "war on drugs" etc).  
It's also important to note that the current version of Bitcoin could be destroyed, but the idea of a stateless decentralized open-source currency could not. The idea is here to stay. 
Destroy Bitcoin, and it'll be immediately replaced with a new - better Bitcoin.

I far as I understand the situation, there is no scaling solution that will reduce the fee for on-chain transactions in long-term. 
When we'll have tens of millions of users, on-chain transactions will be more expensive than today, and there is nothing that we can do to prevent it. The only way is to do off-chain transactions (which could be ~10c  or even cheaper)

Citizens of the Nazi Germany were generally happy with it, and it worked (well, till the WW2). Plenty of jobs, enough food for everyone, new roads, a life purpose for every citizen etc. Nevertheless, it was the right thing to do to destroy the Nazi Germany and make those citizens unhappy for a few decades. 
It's the saddest thing about dictatorships: most citizens actually love them. 
From my personal experience: many Russians are still have fond feelings about the USSR in spite of the fact that every single of them have relatives who died in Gulag. 


The NHS is funded from taxation. Obligatory taxation works exactly like extortion by mafia: if you pay the mafia, they'll protect you. If you don't pay the mafia, they'll do horrible things to you. 
Compare it to a system based on free market: I can choose the provider of any service, or choose no provider at all. I also can freely choose drugs, doctors, clinics etc, even if they're not approved by the Gov.

One possible scenario is adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve currency by the government of some small island country. 
In such scenario, no mass adoption or high valuation is needed. Only a single political decision. 
The decision will cause a massive publicity, and other countries will follow, some of them adopting Bitcoin as their second national currency. 
After the chain reaction has started, the money will flow to Bitcoin from the weaker national currencies, devaluing them to death.

Pretty much in every developed country the gov is testing a blockchain-based tech, including cryptocurrencies. Some of them are already using it (like Georgia to record land claims). It's quite possible that one of them will introduce some crypto. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:17:21
There is a huge problem with your reasoning. All or almost all altcoins will have exactly the same scaling problem after (if) they reach the same on-chain transaction volume as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is slow and expensive because it's popular. Litecoin (and other altcoins) are fast and cheap because almost no one use them. 
They're like Bitcoin in 2011: empty. 
One also need to remember that regardless of the scaling solution, on-chain transactions will be expensive, and will become more expensive over time. It's a problem of all blockchain-based tech. On-chain transactions are only for moving huge sums and to settle off-chain transactions.

A conclusion that I made from the table is that almost all bans of Bitcoin are ideology-related. If you vote for a socialist or nationalist, you're increasing the risk of such ban. 
Sanders is a self-proclaimed socialist, and his voters are mostly socialists. It means, that if you vote for him, you're increasing the risk the ban.
Although you don't need my table to independently come to the same conclusion. Many political views of Sanders are anti-capitalist and statist, which is an antithesis of Bitcoin.

The example of Switzerland shows us that it's possible to build a system superior to NHS, a system that has significantly less governmental meddling into free market. Which is logical, as free market means higher efficiency, lower prices and better quality of services.

@_date: 2017-05-09 20:18:55
I agree, it looks suspicious. 
I once guesstimated that a trader needs less than $50 mln to manipulate the price of Bitcoin in 15%. 
For a major investment company, $50 mln is nothing. They spend more  monthly on the air conditioning of their HQ skyscraper.  
I think it's reasonable to assume that such company or companies are artificially manipulating the price. Most probably for profit, but maybe to achieve some other goal.  
It means, the price will crash soon, and crash hard.

* the market was manipulated, and it was done by the same organisation 
I think the  is the most probable,  is a bit less probable, and  is rather unlikely, but possible.

If it's true, I guess their goal is to get rid of the omnipresent US Dollar as a threat to Canada. There is some logic in such position, but still very untypical for a nationalist party to support a global anti-statist currency.

Very interesting data, thank you!
As far as I know, Bitcoin was declared illegal in Colombia recently.  It's a possible reason why p2p platforms like Mycelium Local Trader could gain popularity.  
I agree, there is indeed a massive boost in general interest too. Judging by the data in the post, there are now x2 more Spanish-speaking people who are interested in Bitcoin than in December 2016. Incredible growth.

@_date: 2017-07-01 18:52:16
How the table was made: 
I created a list of all countries where Bitcoin was banned. Then I identified the person/party responsible for the ban. Also added the proposed ban in France as it was proposed by a presidential candidate (Le Pen). Could be important in the next elections. Then I added the main ideology of the culprit. 
It looks like the main political enemies of Bitcoin are nationalists and socialists. With the exception of Iceland, every single country-wide ban of Bitcoin was made by a nationalist or socialist political party. 
It’s also important to note that democratic socialism is an enemy of Bitcoin too (as we can see from the ban in Ecuador). If you’re an American bitcoiner, it’s reasonable to vote against Bernie Sanders on the next elections. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:50:28
I agree, it would be more logical to categorize le Pen as a "right wing nationalist". My fault. 
I have no political agenda. If you help me create a new version with a more neutral wording, I'll post it here.

I guess the old ones still remember the Mt.Gox and the following Bitcoin Winter. Two of them even expect the price to be below $1000.  On the other hand, the $15 000 forecast is also made by an old one. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:24:47
I agree with your arguments, and the 10 years estimate seems reasonable (although I would say 10-15 years is more realistic). 
Some other important factors that increase the value of Bitcoin:

I'm German, and we have a heavily centralized and over-regulated system too (although not as oppressive as the NHS). 
It works, and many Germans are happy with it. But its efficiency doesn't make it less oppressive. 
All of it must be completely privatized and de-regulated. Because it's better to live in a free country with poor healthcare than in a concentration camp with great healthcare. 
It's also not a binary choice. In comparison with the UK or Germany, healthcare in Switzerland is basically a free market. And it's one of the most effective healthcare systems ( in the world by the average life expectancy). 
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:06:15
Range is optional, you can just write your price. 
Although if you don't use range, you're decreasing your changes: "$2500" has a smaller probability of being correct than "$2400-$2600". 
On the other side, if your range is too wide, someone could out-compete you by providing a prediction with a less wide range around the correct future price. 
So, it's not just guessing the future price. To win this contest, you need to play wisely.

For me, Bitcoin has a fixed value. 1 Bitcoin is always exactly equal to 1 Bitcoin. But the values of other things (USD, Tesla, food etc) change over time. If I can buy a burger for 0.01 BTC today and 2 burgers tomorrow, it's the value of burgers that has changed, not the value of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is the universal and unchangeable measure of value. 
Bitcoin is not becoming more expensive over time. The things that you can buy with Bitcoin are becoming cheaper.  


Most of my wealth is in Bitcoin, so 0,1 BTC will not be a problem. Especially if it shoots to 2,5 million usd/btc:) 
If it reaches 2,5 million by 1 September, I'll buy a gold-plated Tesla, travel to the winner's house and personally hag him :)
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:30:03

It's exactly the same story with Bitcoin. For some (small minority) it's a tool for criminals etc. For others (majority) it's just a new financial instrument with its upsides and downsides. 
There are also people (like me) who support Bitcoin for political reasons. If my country bans Bitcoin, I'll move to a more Bitcoin-friendly country (because such ban means that my country is totalitarian, and it's a bad idea to live in a totalitarian country). 


Cash is significantly more anonymous than Bitcoin. Most criminals use cash, and not Bitcoin. Do you support a worldwide ban of cash?


IMHO most bitcoiners own other cryptocurrencies too. For example, I store a significant portion of my wealth in crypto, but only ~60% of it is in Bitcoin. 
As the demand for stateless currencies will still exist (and will continue to grow), the price of other crypto will go up, and at least a part of my wealth will be recovered. Diversification is the investor's best friend.


There are currently over 1000+ crypto, with all kinds of models of incentives. I think in 10 years or less we'll know the answer. 


It don't need to. Unless we end up in a global North-Korea-style dictatorship with Orwellian control over every financial transaction, there will be stateless currencies. Regardless of how the Gov perceives such currencies. 
I hope that one day we'll transition to a society where personal privacy is respected, including financial privacy. A society where all financial transactions are untraceable and anonymous by default. Such society will be a better place to live for everyone - from political activists to entrepreneurs to your average Joe, even if some people will use anonymity for bad things.

I think it depends on your priorities and financial situation. Say, if I have some serious medical condition, I better invest some of the money in my health instead of waiting for the Moon. 
Selling Bitcoin for fiat is a terrible idea, of course. Fiat is one of the worst possible investments. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:12:45
It's the reason why there should be no government involved:
governmental regulations are making all types of drugs and medical treatments more expensive.

Mostly far-right and far-left. Everyone else has a significantly lower probability of banning Bitcoin.

The German Gov exercises significantly more control over the Bundesbank than the US Gov over the Fed. For example, this is how the members of the Board are selected:
I agree about the ECB, it's basically an independent corporation where central banks of the member states are shareholders.

I think most speculators store their coins on exchanges (to sell and buy quickly). 
Paper wallets are good for a one-time long-term storage, but for a regular use one need a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:03:44
Good question!
I think it's especially interesting to compare the performance of other blockchain protocols with the historical performance of the Bitcoin blockchain. One way to do it is to use Bitcoin as the standard and measure the differences between this standard and some other blockchain protocol. 
For example, some cryptocurrency X is currently doing 100 000 transactions per month. From the historical data we know that there was a similar number of Bitcoin transactions in 2011. 
The median transaction fee for cryptocurrency X is $2. It's 170x times more expensive than Bitcoin transactions in 2011. Therefore, the blockchain protocol of the cryptocurrency X has significantly lower scalability than Bitcoin.

So, I made some research about hardware wallets, and today I decided to buy Ledger. I checked the site but was disappointed: I can't buy it till August because they're out of stock.

In Germany and in Russia there is no such independent structure as the Fed. It's more like a typical gov agency there (although with some autonomy). 
I think the Fed model is rather an exception.

Could you please elaborate on the most important differences between them?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:06:04
I think I understand. Although it depends on the gov. There is a difference between the US Gov, and, say, the Gov of Bulgaria. 
Nevertheless, the table should be correct for most countries, even for the US. The base "easiness" could vary, but Bitcoin will remain to be the hardest asset to expropriate. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:56:14
I agree, this could be one of the contributing factors. 
Although there are other indicators of the growing adoption. For example, a lot of new coinbase users and bitpay purchases. Combined, they show that there is indeed a significant growth.

It's not a measure of people leaving but a measure of people diversifying. Rational people never store all of their money in one place. 
Almost 100% of all altcoin holders are also bitcoiners. And, judging by the market caps, Bitcoin is still the biggest part of their crypto portfolios. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:08:21
Not sure about it. If we divide the market cap by $5000, we'll get 13 200 000 people. 
Even if a negligible minority controls 90% of coins, it's still more than 1 million people who have at least $5000 in Bitcoin.
