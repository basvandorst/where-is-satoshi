People really should stop advertising zero fees. There is a fee, every time, which is not even tied to the amount of money you are transferring, but amount of data going around. It can make small transaction expensive sometimes

how do you use cash to buy bitcoins?

Except that soon everyone has one and you won't actually make that much because the network automatically adjusts the difficulty according to the processing power

That technology alone is worth the money

How can bitcoin change the world more than internet since bitcoin is part of how internet has changed the world. Subset cannot be larger than the superset.

Actually the transaction comes through in a matter of seconds but for it to be confirmed by multiple nodes usually takes several minutes. This is nothing normal user should worry about though

Think of all that power rented for scientific computing. You could probably make about the same money there.

You could say the same about all the thibgs that internet currently is. They merely leverage internet

I would really like a context to this quote. Who was he referring to? I'm on my phone now, but I'll try to search once I get to my computer

Gmail doesn't offer PGP not because "they are greedy evil corporation", it's because you'd have to trust Google with your private key then. If you don't trust Google now, why would you trust them with your key. And since it's so easy to set up a desktop client for those who actually want it, there's not much point.
edit. Would someone care to explain why was I downvoted? Does someone really think it's good idea to give your private key to google?
