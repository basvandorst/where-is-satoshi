Idk im trying to figure out what influences the market. The recent drop was predicted weeks ago. How did they know? Back in late winter it was predicted the market would surge around June/July. Again, how did they know? If I was a billionaire id buy up all the tokens i could and play that game, if thats how it works. But is it really that simple? Ive been holding a long time but I keep making bad decisions. Back in 2017/2018 I had like 40 cents or so and it turned into $40 during the surge. What caused that? Recently it was at 11 something and in an hour dropped drastically to 9. The only thing I can think of is someone has a shit ton of coins and sold and cashed out

I wish I saved btc. I always used it right away. I had btc at 100 all the way to present day. I am such a dumbass. I could be living like fucking royalty if i had saved my money and invested it in btc

But the "interest" it gains is?  Its not like btc is investing the money and gaining value. Like if im the only one holding, btc isnt going to increase in value. There isnt really a demand for it besides when you don't want ppl knowing what you're spending your dough on. I can't think of any other legitimate reasons to use it besides illegal transactions and now the possibility that it will experience another mega surge and increase in value. How did the first coins gain momentum. I remember way back it was like a few dollars. Idk it hurts my head thinking about it. Hopefully we experience another surge by the end of the year
