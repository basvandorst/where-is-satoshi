Sounds like you wanted to cash in on a fork. You need to be extra careful when you do that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:55:09
My main objection to a simple 2MB hard fork is that it merely kicks the can regarding max blocksize increases. I would support this compromise if the max blocksize is set on the protocol for future increases.

This needs to be translated to chinese and communicated to all chinese miners.

What I don't really get is if Roger Ver truly believes Bitcoin Unlimited is so great, why doesn't he launch his own implementation ("Rogercoin"?)  Why must he have to hijack the current bitcoin blockchain? If I were him and had his resources I would certainly try it. I am suspecting instead he really does not trust Bitcoin Unlimited code, or developers and is just posturing to divide the bitcoin comunity to pump alt coins he probably has already divested in, and/or help Jihan sell mining equipment.

To think that LN will reduce miner revenue is myopic. LN needs to settle transactions and with high priority, this equates to more fees for miners.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:37:37
I really don't understand what is Jihan's end game with his move to BU. Such a move will cause BTC price to plummet, and all his mining investment will be destroyed in an instant not to mention his already suffering reputation. Totally suicidal.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:20:03
This is not how it works. Miners are in there for the money. What miners aren't seeing is that they can earn a lot more from L2 transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:23:30


They want to push off small miners and take control of all the mining is the most logical answer. A worse possibility is PBOC is actually in control of chinese miners and is attempting to subvert bitcoin.

Ideally Core Devs would add it to the next release with a command line option to activate it.

how about an Asic chip that can do double SHA256 for current PoW but easily switchable to do triple SHA256 for a quick change of PoW.

There seems to have been a glitch at huobi, trading data was missing or wrong and chinese traders panicked.
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:03:22
Not at all. Most Chinese exchanges charge zero fees per trade. This is the real reason volumes are outrageously high.

Bitcoin will always rise in price eventually because it is game changer unlike other investments like stocks or commodities. Just buy as much bitcoin you feel comfortable and don't sell unless it is for a major enhancement to your life and enjoyment (house, trip, debt relief etc).

Note that a real &gt;95% majority in block voting is not practically necessary. A lesser majority of miners can agree to orphan non segwit voting blocks. Even the threat of this happening will edge on the fence miners to vote for Segwit.

I feel sorry for the Indian people who have been saving their money hoarding their precious $7 and $15 bills. In a bid to institutionalize the underground economy so as get more tax revenue, they are being robbed outright. I doubt they have universal access to banking like we are used to in the west. I also find it disgusting how the PM is plastered on all the announcements.
@_date: 2019-06-07 00:24:01
I think it is spitting out fake bills as a marketing ploy.
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:02:12
Is it of any meaning what the miners vote for in determining max blocksize at the protocol level? I think miners will invariably vote for the largest possible block size since it allows them more flexibility in creating their own blocks. They can always create smaller blocks if they want.

The way I envision it is that you sign up with a Lightning Network Provider (LNP). You "deposit" some bitcoins from your regular wallet, to the LNP wallet. This will work as a "checking" account, where you can quickly spend your bitcoins in day to day transactions with different merchants like the coffee shop, who have also signed up with a LNP.   
Different LNPs will connect to each other, so if your merchant and are not using the same LNP he can still accept payment from you.  
LNP earn some fees, or might even pay you just to have you on board (negative fees).   
In order to be a LNP you must hold a lot of bitcoins to be able to handle all the channels open to you.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:57:25
yet he holds the bitcoin.com domain
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:24:33
It is now very clear the "capacity problems" were fabricated via tx spamming by special interests to create a false urgency for on chain scaling by Bitmain, Roger Ver etal. Where is the urgency now? If bitcoin is growing surely this capacity problem is now worse, but it isn't. In fact Bitcoin Cash has minimal block sizes, as so the original Bitcoin with lulls of almost empty mempools.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:01:27
when Ver must sell his bitcoin.com domain we will know he is done for.

It doesn't matter if the largest LN hubs will be run by huge companies. What matters is that is trustless and still bitcoin.

If UASF has 30% hashpower it will languish for 6-7 weeks with 33 minute blocks. It is going to be a really tough battle.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:25:09
Another Bitmain shill. Sad!
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:11:13
Unfortunately all miners with ASICBoost Antminers will never switch over to UASF because they won't be able to mine Segwit blocks with a huge competitive disadvantage (less fees). This is at least 60% of the miners I think.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:21:38
It is not possible to run ASICBoost overtly, because those bits are already being used. Covertly you need to select tx and change the bits which will be used for the segwit witness merkle root. That is why Segwit will destroy covert ASICBoost if any.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:08:19
Because the Silbert Agreement isn't about activating the current SegWit but another version of SegWit with 2mb HF. The *real* reason for the wanted HF is that current SegWit breaks covert ASICBoost for Bitmain Antminers. That is why Jihan etal has been adamantly blocking Segwit ever since it was published. I am suspecting the Antminers can't even mine Segwit blocks *at all* I hope someone with an Antminer can confirm this on Testnet, as if this is true, it will be a disaster when UASF kicks in.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:25:45
The real reason for the 2mb HF is to be able to keep Bitmain's covert ASICBoost when Segwit is activated. It stinks.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:24:23
It is the reason Jihan Wu originally accepted the Hong Kong agreement before Segwit was developed, and then broke it when he saw the final implementation of Segwit and realized it would break his covert ASICBoost.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:17:37
80% of hashrate agreed to *another* version of Segwit that allows ASICBoost since it would be a hard fork. This version will take months of development *not* coming from Core. It is simply not happening.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:45:16
If you have your bitcoins in Coinbase or any exchange. *Move them to your own wallet before Aug 1st* Own wallet meaning you control the private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:07:10
Great stuff. Explains why bitcoin usually traded cheaper in BTC-e
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:33:34
Jihan "agreed" merely to stall current Segwit activation. He wants another version of Segwit that is ASICBoost compatible. Will take months to develop and test. That is just bullshit. UASF only way now.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:05:33
That issue about "not trusting core" is a red herring. Miners want, nay, need to block segwit because their Antminers cannot mine segwit blocks, and lose their covert ASICBoost advantage. Segwit has proven to work perfectly well in Litecoin.
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:24:34
The quick retarget difficulty in ethereum is what is allowing the classic fork to survive with only 5% hashpower. In bitcoin that would not be possible.
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:44:45
Also to note, is how easy it was for the "rebelling" miners to continue on the same chain due to the quick retarget of difficulty in Ethereum. In bitcoin for a hard fork to split successfully  you will need 40:60 contention. With only 5% or 10% or even 20% of hashpower staying on the original fork would fail since the difficulty would be unsurmountable as the retarget takes normally 2 weeks. But with blocks would taking lot longer the new difficulty would take a lot longer to arrive too.
 
@_date: 2016-07-27 21:07:23
which Ethereum chain will it support (or both?). Can it be used for Expanse?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:50:37
Bitmain can easily resolve all this by just signalling segwit readiness. Would be over in two weeks.
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:35:01
If these miners currently signaling segwit stick with their guns August 1st. UASF will be a success in less than an hour. We will have Segwit on bitcoin by August 15.
