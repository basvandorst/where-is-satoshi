Are you implying we live in a necessarily unequal society where a person is valued based upon what they own?

His bank account was writing checks he now doesn't want to cash. Tax dodging is a lot harder in countries with higher tax rates and less loopholes, so he went to a country where he could pay next to nothing and now he's paying for it.

Blackmore it was a sarcastic remark to the point of absurdity mirroring the position of Americommies.

LOVE IT when libertarians cry statist. Until they have a robust definition of a state that wouldn't apply to neighborhood association or boy scout troop in existence, they have no room to talk about statism, as they are hyper-statists. 
And preemptively here is a great definition of the state:
“The state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without; just as little is it 'the reality of the ethical idea', 'the image and reality of reason', as Hegel maintains. Rather, it is
a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has split into irreconcilable
antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, these classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of 'order'; and this power, arisen out of society but placing itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state."

His look reminds me of that video of the American POW in North Vietnam, I was waiting for him to blink out torture or something.

Paying back to the society that allowed you to amass your wealth is slavery. I mean he was FORCED to go to school, and then was FORCED to pay taxes and FORCED to get permits for his business ventures to ensure others safety. If that's not a slave, I don't know that is.

He went to the St Kitts to avoid taxes, why would he even consider a country with a higher tax rate?

What's dumb about using a cryptocurrency to then trade for a currency you denounce every chance you get? And what's dumb about leaving the US for tax reasons, by going to a country that's human development ranks behind Cuba, Russia, Mexico, and almost all of Eastern Europe, then complaining he was judged by the same standards as others from that country on if he would return to his country of residence? And what's dumb about yelling Waco at the ATF and FBI, like just about every white supremacist has since 1993 (I mean it's not like there are literally hundreds of other examples that have no ties racist subcultures he could have cited)?
Nope Ol' Roger is the reasonable one in this case.

Aww, poor man got poor advice, if there were such a thing, this would be the most ironic form of karma ever.

So the first part of what I wanted to point out, has been, IE that you're not double taxed. I will point out the second: You are, by virtue of paying those taxes afforded services of the US government. Like emergency evacuation, criminal protections, what have you. So it's not like you're paying for nothing, and if you are in most 1st world countries, you're literally not paying for services rendered.
