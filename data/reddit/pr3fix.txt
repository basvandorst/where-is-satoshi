There's a non-zero possibility of a 51% attack with Bitcoin though. That kinda negates the premises of decentralized. I do think Bitcoin is the best coin today but it is not without it's flaws. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:33:15
dips are still pricey though -- like lately a "dip" has been 13-14k. think it'll dip sub-10k ever again?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:39:39
Is anyone buying now? or waiting it out? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:28:44
how many of you own full coin(s)? Just got into BTC and not sure if it'll ever drop low enough to actually purchase a whole one :(
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:41:29
LOT of sells going on right now. Dropping to 16.4
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:41:15
You are a wonderful human being. I wish more people who came into such extreme wealth were as empathetic to the world around them. Cheers my friend and happy holidays!
If you ever feel like giving out BTC to us redditors my wallet is always available ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:13:22
It's all about what you want in life my friend.
If cashing out now could put you into a state where you feel like your personal needs (whatever is important to YOU) are fulfilled, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with cashing out. Don't be beholden to a meme.
You could also cash out some and keep some, don't need to go all in either way :) as difficult of a decision it is to make, realize you're in an extremely fortunate position right now that many of us (myself included) never have or will have. You can't really make a wrong choice so go with your gut. 
Cheers and good luck!

I guess the question is how long does a bubble take? Since you could illustrate this trend on any long enough timeline with variance 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:19
Similar, I bought a good chunk at 16.5.. wanted to buy more when it hit 13 today but had already spent my crypto budget :) sort of the catalyst for this question 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:16:07
I would argue MySpace was premature -- the world at large wasn't interested in social networks yet. They weren't "cool". Same with Friendster et. al.
The real question is determining whether BTC is the MySpace or the Facebook of Crypto..
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:36:39
What do you think, say, a 100USD buy now could net once we get to the Moon? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:18:43
Crazy in what way? Up or down? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:24:50
4 is 1 key over that way friend &lt;-- :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:07:13
sure, but BTC has seen &gt;40% fluctuations in the past too. How is now any different?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:31:26
Any point in getting into cryptos other than BTC, ETH and LTC? Are those the only "real" players in the space ATM?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:18
the real question is do we buy now or just hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:32
Please do, just be a good friend &amp; PM me beforehand ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:19
so would you say its wise to buy in at pre-16.5 prices? (right now sitting at 16.4)
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:35:33
It also might be the highest though ��
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:17:47
Gold has been around a hell of a lot longer than BTC, has history behind it, and actually has physical real-world uses.
Not to say that BTC doesn't have value, but I think you can't directly equate the two.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:43:48
when you see it climbing so fast its hard not to buy buy buy �� FOMO is real
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:31
I don't really understand why you're trying to gatekeep here. Who cares how long people have held? It's not like I'm panicking and selling everything. Just having a conversation. Chill my friend. :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:20:58
What do you personally think it could collapse to? I feel like the other collapses, BTC was not nearly as mainstream as it is today. The collapse could be big but the recovery could also be quick. Pretty much everyone and their grandma knows about BTC's historical bubble -&gt; burst -&gt; bigger bubble behavior so IMO if it burst we'd just see major bear market buying.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:55
Better question: at what price would you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:45:23
What is this implying? That CME will tank BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:33:05
I stand corrected! ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:24:19
No one knows man. Go with your gut. IMO, still lots of room to grow, if you buy &amp; hodl now you'll likely make some profit but who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:06
curious about this as well. I imagine it's going to stimulate a moderate crash.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:58:22
Great reply, thanks. You state we could reach 50k "if the bubble doesn't pop" -- but that seems to imply you feel this is a bubble and not the actual price discovery of bitcoin. 
Do you personally feel an alt coin would supercede BTC in the coming year(s), or does BTC have too much escape velocity behind it? In technology it's often first to market / largest brand recognition who wins and not necessarily who has the best tech, but I could also see other coins taking off simply because they're more usable than BTC currently is.
Do you feel BTC is more of a store of value, or a currency intended to be used day in and day out?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:10
I bought at 17.5 and we're already back down to 15... Thems the shakes. 
If you had to guess do you think we'll get a 5-6k corretion within the next week?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:12:54
People had the exact same complaints -- it's too difficult, it's too slow, it's too confusing -- about the internet. 
It's definitely still around.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:00:19
that's my other concern, too -- too much market fragmentation with competing coins/standards. BTC is clearly the leader right now but I'm not sure how the market could support so many concurrent alt coins.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:19:27


Do you mind elaborating on this point? I'm not terribly familiar with XRP. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:12:07

@_date: 2017-12-11 02:26:44
Are we leveling off at low-16? After the initial 15.5-16 dash seems to have stalled. Anyone buying now or you waiting to see how the dust settles?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:02:30
The only comment I have to this is that history shows us, time and time again, it's not necessarily the BEST technology that wins, but often the first. See: Facebook vs Google+. I know, not currencies, but a better product doesn't necessarily take over just because it is better. Brand recognition and the early spread of BTC could secure its longterm potential.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:26:27
buy &amp; hodl? or wait for a leveled out dip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:45:52
Of course. Not looking for answers, just conversation/speculation :-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:55:47
Oh, I'm not worrying :) I've been quietly hodling for about 1.5 months now. I think my confusion stems from how rapidly its accelerated in the last month. The growth rate from 2013-2016, while quick, seemed healthier. This crazy 8k -&gt; 19k spike in 30 days just seems unsustainable. 
I just wonder if it will keep going up and up, or if it'll be dethroned by a more usable coin and all this will mean nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:43:06
how do you determine the bottom with such rapid fluctuation? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:05:58
Haven't bought in this dip yet, no. But I've been holding since the last time we were at 13k.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:14:38
Not trying to bait here or anything, just genuinely curious. would you mind elaborating? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:37:45
I wasn't trying to literally compare it to the internet apples to apples. This is an entirely brand new asset class. There is no way to predict it's future performance by comparing it to other existing asset classes, like stocks. That toaster is centralized, non digital and finitely scalable. Apples and oranges. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:54:07
Great post. Just out of curiosity, how long have you been hodling? What was the price per BTC when you started? did you buy a lot up-front or just slowly grow over the years?
I have no qualms hodling for years. I'm just depressed I'm so late to the party :( accumulating even 1 BTC at this point feels herculian. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:18
You don't think it could ever drop back to 1k?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:43:54
But now it feels like we're buying tickets from the scalpers jacking up the price instead of the actual conductor :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:50:49
how much $$$ did you drop? :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:06
which dip? 13k yesterday? It's been mid-15 to 16 all day 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:03:29
anything other than hype to back up that claim?
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:54:20
It’s bad writing because the white walkers were totally unrelated to her entire plot arc. Like she didn’t even know about them until a few weeks before she ends up killing their leader. Her plot arc is focused on kings landing. Meanwhile the characters who’s plot arc DOES involve the white walkers (Bran, John, hell even Tormund or Sam) get totally jipped on the conclusion of the arc.
It’s like if Pippin came out of nowhere at the end of lord of the rings and destroyed the ring. Totally invalidates the journey of Sam and Frodo.
