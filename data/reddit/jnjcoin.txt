You are the type of person that makes this forum seem like a bunch of clowns sorry I don't have a meme 
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:24:15
When btc hits 100k then I get a crypto tattoo.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:43:29

@_date: 2018-01-08 10:53:08
I did my research I was convinced enough other people didn't that bcash actually has a chance because ver is a good liar. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:24:50
Didn't you get the memo join Gemini and or get the robin hood app 
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:22:53
Means you should sign up with Gemini or robin hood app now.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:32:27
I've never seen it so low kind of scary, is no one using it any more lol.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:42:29

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:56:34
No matter what has to be taxed then even if I buy a Tesla woth straight bitcoin then. What if I sell it out of the country lol.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:10:08

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:24:15
I have twice contacting them. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:48:13

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:04:56
Ok that feature was a little different but makes sense now. I havnt made my wallet yet but look forward to it. Do you know what's the lowest USD amount that can be sent on it? I'm looking for a wallet I can send people small amounts on to try bitcoin out. I buy with Gemini and send to my ledger but Gemini lowest amount I could send was 26$! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:15:40
Sorry. Actually you know what me and my girl friend bought and had it sent to out PO box found out the hard way they don't deliver to PO boxes so we paid them the full amount and havnt got a email saying more then we will get back to you. So I'm actually more mad at ledger then you. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:15:02

There is a cool feature that makes the app hidden you have to dial a code for it to pop up. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:33:14
Does Gemini have segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:52:14

@_date: 2019-03-22 00:19:50
I started buying at 600 and I wish it never went up to 20k
@_date: 2019-03-18 04:01:12
Google Gemini exchange. Buy the Bitcoin there. Then look up a couple way on making a bitcoin paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:29:03
I remember my first Bitcoin back in 2016.
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:29:20
I wish that hype train never happen.
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:14:58
I miss 2016ish I believe when it was at 600. My good friend told me about it at that point he already had several, I was upset he didn't tell me sooner. I really wish it didn't get so mainstream And shoot up to 20k. I was traveling the country I told everyone about it I got Uber drivers to buy it one out of like ten people bought it immediately. And I told him hundreds of people about it. I feel like I might have put a dent in things. Me my girlfriend my brother and my dad got banned from coinbase for some reason. I use Gemini now. And have a ledger nano  :)
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:14:24
Yeah but you have to give me a handy 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:44:48
Yup I took out 400 around 3400 would of been what like 600 lol 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:33:31
You had to go out of your way to tell me that? You just stay with your negative thoughts and stay the fuck away from me. Lol you carry on 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:39:21

@_date: 2019-02-13 23:46:28

When I get people to join they join because it will make them money not because the potential it has lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:08:23
In one year it's gone from about 6 or 800 to 8200. That's about 1000% or like 7x I'm no math guy but if it comes close to growing that much in another year now is the perfect time. Probably for the next 8 years bitcoin will grrow and go down a little then keep growing huge.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:59:48
I was lucky started at 600 had a coin by 1200. Sucks I slowed way down after getting one. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:58:14

@_date: 2018-11-03 03:34:27

@_date: 2018-04-09 11:48:20
What's the point in having Bitcoin going down that low if you couldn't send such a little amount?  Otherwise handing you a penny might be easier. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:37:11
They want to centralize mining more then it is is that ok with you? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:33:50
Kicked or get stuck on crap coin 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:05:53
Think of a game when they make changes to the game while your playing like soft fork hard fork requires a complete shutdown. What I got from it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:14:30
No more then 50 a month I'm not making money just want to support the system and I can use my node to validate I think 
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:00:53
When you work as much as me and sleep 4 hours a day maybe 5 you would understand lol 
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:40:14
Do some more research please jihan and ver want high fees 
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:45:04
You found a good one you can buy and sell at
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:34:12
I've been on Reddit a day now :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:40:55
He's making like a million a day off fees alone 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:02:03
Yes I'm about to run my pi  bitcoin node and signal for core 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:34:36
Storage and memory sent the same thing. I've been I to crypto 6 months and trying to learn it all. :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:02:09
Wow lol colony on the dark side of the moon? Lol 
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:10:05
I swore they wanted the same thing jihan makes a lot off fees plus all the block he hits everyday. I think he makes more off fees though.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:59:31
Hard drive technology needs to keep up meaning be cheap enough for normal users to run nodes and mine 
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:44:08
Yes sir 
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:22:12
Honestly as long as the price goes up who cares if jihan owns bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:59:03
We can increase block size when storage technology  gets cheaper not just the rich can run nodes. There is a little more to it then that.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:45:39
Nothing should be forced in bitcoin. Also bitcoin should not be a democracy look at America democracy is failing because to many stupid people. And you can have a degree and still have your stupid moments..
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:15:34

Soon as i get a hard drive I'll be on guys with my friends help though....  
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:35:29
We need to put a stop to all this tax is there a Reddit forum for that 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:44:41
What about the U.S. handing over the internet to what's their name icaan?
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:43:44
Because I couldn't run a bitcoin node and validate my own transaction hard drive technology can't keep up with that much memory. It will centralize bitcoin if we go to 8mb. That's what I get from it 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:53:16
He looks like a dirt bag who has to pay for sex 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:36:53

@_date: 2017-06-15 20:23:58
Dnt count how many times I'm talking to people about bitcoin and I go to show them how nice bitcoin it and coinbase ruins it I have to say coinbase has nothing to do with bitcoin besides to buy it lol what a joke

Never good to keep them all in the same place so I'll hold one for you. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:09:39

@_date: 2017-06-13 19:48:02

@_date: 2017-07-31 10:02:25
Going to zero going to 100k. Or maybe a big drop then back to New records
