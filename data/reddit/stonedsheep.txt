In late 2013 there were multiple reasons why BTC went 10x in such a short period of time.
-General FOMO and new paradigm mindset
-Tons of new alts being mined and converted to BTC bringing in more liquidity
-Chinese exchanges coming online and adding liquidity
-Mtgox willy bot
I'm sure there are plenty more reasons that can be determined for the 1k price extension but ultimately its not one distinct cause but a collection of events that led to the frenzy.

EOS had a blow off top right before this retraction those profit takers moved gains from crypto pairs(BTC/ETH) into fiat all at once. only way bigger players &amp; hedge funds are able to retain their profit is to slam into fiat on the receiving pairs.

Correct, with BTC futures trading on regulated exchanges this pursuit will be an inevitability for regulators. There is a necessity to ensure an equitable market for the underlying asset so that institutions trading the derivative don't go bankrupt when Jihan or rogue miners spam the memepool, DDOS exchanges and trigger margin calls to fill their bids.

Blockchain bloat is a serious issue, the only solution as stated in the article is via various data layers and sidechains; we should start to see more sidechains come online once segwit has been fully implemented.

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is FUD that compels the weak to sell lows which were prior highs weeks ago. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be salty fiat holders. In the end only Bitcoin will remain.

Don't mine BTC you will need dedicated hardware, if you get a few halfway decent GPUs you can mine certain alts and sell those for BTC instead.
