Brazilian people wanted to be validated, it's like they want bitcoin to be like a regulated investment, they expect it to be like a saving account against the Brazilian inflation. people want it to be validated, so they can start speculating or saving by bitcoin. People here generally have lots of trouble on understanding bitcoin like a currency, and that's for me is worrying. Last year I've made a lecture for the business administration class from the federal University of my city and they couldn't understand the nature of bitcoin, all they have understood is that it's like a way to make money, like a  risky investment.

the bank of england is willing to privatize the cryptocurrencies, that's horrible, we dont need any control from the state, just let the markets decide how to manage itself with a pre-determined ammount of money, i guess we shoud try to go back to a non factional-reserve banking system so we could get rid of the "artificial economy".
