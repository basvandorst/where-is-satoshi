you forgot decentralized, but then again i guess you wont be able to say that about the lightning network

That has to be one of the greatest lines, or at least most badass, in movie history
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:29:12
That has to be the worst "refutation" I have ever seen. He consistently misses the point of the videos arguments or just simply says 'he's wrong'. There is absolutely no convincing force behind anything that that guy is saying. Reading that just further convinced me me that LN will fail
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:42
Large centralized hubs where have to deposit money with high fee on chain transactions just so blockstream can get their cut?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:50
And it will be expensive and useless to create a LN channel to a specific person. You wont form channels with everyone you want to transact with. You form channels to people that are connect to a lot of other people that you may transact with in the future.

you dont get $30 fees bevause someone is spamming micro transactions... There have to be tens of thousands of transactions with double digit fees for that to happen

I was never able to download a CD and then suddenly no longer able to...

I work in tech, there is a reason engineers are engineers and not in product. You want engineers having a say in product but you dont want engineers dictating product

Did they make the tokens tradeable? I feel like btce could create a market for them for the people that want to cash out completely.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:01:11
is there a chart for that anywhere? I would be curious to see what kind of discount they traded at. I imagine it would start around 40 or 50 cents on the dollar
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:28:40
Oh totally, this definitely convinced me 2x has no support
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:56:10
Nodes are easy to spin up or turn off. I'll likely start a segwit2x node during the transition just to spite you guys
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:58:14
I have a great idea for fee reduction. What if we simply raised the blocksize by a measly megabyte?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:21:02
what if I just want to send some to my buddy one room over to cover my share of dinner? And to do what you are saying it is actually really cheap if I just use a different crypto
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:04:32
exponential growth never lasts. hard to tell when it will stop though
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:28:41
1.5% is a ridiculous fee! Is there anywhere I can get btc cheaper?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:53:54
welp i guess ill just settle for 2x then
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:29:20
Yes lets give all of the power to core!
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:15:12
This isn't a correction this is a rotation into alts

I bought at 600 not too long ago and was worried i missed it. This has been nuts
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:14:23
what downsides could there possibly be to a 1mb increase?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:46:15
bitcoin costs way way too much per transaction to be used in any manner similar to cash
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:12
why? there already exist cheaper options
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:13:06
Man i wish we had a little bit more bandwidth in blocks to ease network congestion. Nothing huge maybe just like an extra 1mb per block
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:32:08
no no no you are not allowed to be reasonable on this sub
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:21:41
what did they do? I imagine I wont be seeing my bcc? I am just going to leave after they come back online so i feel like this will probably backfire from the churn
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:52:46
maybe the gov is forcing them offline for investigative stuff and will allow them back online in 5-10? Maybe that is just wishful thinking
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:57:42
They just upgraded all their charting too. Was really happy with the site
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:53:27
I had a decent amount on btce as well. We should probably wait untilt things clarify but idk if the government seized the coin on btce what do we do? Lawyer up?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:02:01
I was just doing some trading I didnt have them there for long and was planning on moving them back to storage for the fork. bad practice for sure and now i might pay for it
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:48:18
Really screw anyone that thinks like this. If you seriously want to play games with a multi billion dollar asset because your egos are too large to compromise you deserve to have bitcoin die. Who would want to be in an asset so easily sabotaged by people's egos?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:02:34
ah yes he must be a simpleton then /s
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:30:55
They tweeted that that they had to do some unexpected maintenance twice. Last tweet was 9 hours ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:08:25
I havent heard that they had seized any coins from btc-e yet. Afaik all we know is one guy got arrested that is somehow affiliated with btc-e
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:19:26
a few weeks
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:49:07
As someone with 20k on that exchange i could give 2 shits about bcc rn I just want my coin back. Maybe in10 days i will be mad about bcc
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:29:45
I have so much coin on btce right now. I feel sick thinking about losing it. Lesson learned
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:52:01
24 hours is the previous longest up to around 30 now. I'm sure whomever runs the site is holding off on keeping it up until the legal situation clarifies itself
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:40:23
yeah i had been meaning to stash most of it in storage for a while now just never seemed to find time to set up wallets in a way where i was confident i wouldnt lose the keys
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:32:19
"Official Report"
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:16:15
ah shit guess we have to lynch him
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:04:43
I emailed support 3x re an exorbitant fee havent heard back once. Pretty much gave up since it was only a few bucks but still pretty shitty experience.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:37:11
who knows I dont even know how I would go about trying to recover the coin from whoever holds them atm. Probably going to have to wait and see
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:03:37
after who stole who's coins?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:22:39
I'm not really putting much stock in them personally
