No, I'm being downvoted because no one has any idea what they're talking about, hence why your comment had 7 upvotes.

That is not how it works. If 3600 BTC were dumped on the market every single day. 3600 BTC moves the market price of Bitfinex down $10 right now, and it's usually worse. You can't assume it would only affect it 2%.

True, but it's funnier to watch them all respond to me pretending to know what they're talking about while all being wrong at the same time.

Every time I see you post here I realize you're even stupider than I thought you are. Are you even a functioning human being?

If Coinbase doesn't work, try Circle. If that doesn't work the easiest exchanges to deposit to would either be Bitstamp or Bitfinex.

Are you actually serious? As a German citizen, do you own any German equities? Then you probably would be very happy with your returns. The DAX is pushing ATH's as I write this. Or do you keep your life savings in cash under your bed like the others here?
