Threaten a class action law suit and I bet you'll get a fancy check for 61 cents and a handy dandy form to sign that says please don't sue us and open our books.

Coinbase isn't an exchange it's a merchant service.
Gdax is an exchange

You buy the bitcoin at 500 but then don't sell it. You just hodl it. That's the real loop you wanna be on

Unless your friend sells the factory to someone for 15 million euros worth of BTC. 
I don't understand how you would expect to sell a 15 million dollar factory in Russia without the government or
Mafia knowing since the government probably controls almost every building in the country that is worth that much. 
But if it's as simple as putting the factory on Craig's List and poof you have 15 million euros cash then you would set up a bank account hop on an exchange place a 15 million dollar buy order crash the price threw the roof of bitcoin and then sell all of them for a huge fee while your bank shut down your account for money laundering. 
Tldr: No

A flash crash could have you trading with money you don't own.
I'll just give you a friendly second cautionary warning.
MARGIN TRADING IS RISKY AF in a market so heavily manipulated by bots and whales and exchanges trying to pretend like It's not them short squeezing everyone.

You've had a ticket for 3 days some have had tickets for months. Relax, maybe don't try to send Btc when the entire network and block is being forked and every exchange is running around with there head chopped off trying to figure out how to handle it. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:17:49
The fees you have to pay buying and transferring bitcoin would probably make it not worth to go out of your way to  buy bitcoin if your using it just to deposit. 
However if your just being super cautious about your bank denying it or getting shut down for illegal gambling depends on the state  . That's one way of circumventing it. 
You can get your winnings paid out in bitcoin, so you could link your bank account then deposit x amount of money then withdraw to an address round about way of getting some Btc. 
I have used bovada for years have made 100s of deposits and withdraws of large sums. It's a great site.

You can not withdraw fiat from bittrex or poloniex. 
There are a couple things you can do.
Send your coins to another exchange that does support fiat such as : Kraken, Gemini,  or gdax 
Or you can send it to a merchant service like coinbase 
You can also send them to your own personal wallet then locate a near by bitcoin ATM if you have one near by. 
Also local bitcoins is an option.

When I was trying to find a secure way to do some sports betting online back in 2011, came across a random article about a poker site using bitcoin, the idea of a untraceable currency just sounded cool so read more articles been keeping track of it ever since. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:44:50
It's not the same thing, but I remember using the satoshi dice game when bitcoin was under 15 dollars a coin and I would mess around a gamble a bunch of them and didn't think anything of it. 
 Then looking back at the page after  Silk Road was seized and the price sky rocketed the first time and wanting to jump off a bridge.
But seeing the prices that are happening recently. 
Makes me wanna jump off a higher bridge.
Made an account just to post that.. those dam shatoshi dice

This may be the dumbest title of any article I've read from one of these main stream sources during the hype this week. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:05:09
The problem I have isn't bitmain and a hard fork or segwit and a soft fork. I get that bitmain is a scary fast tack towards centralization for some people and a segwit isn't enough for others or any of the other arguments that come up for each side.  I admit I don't know which one will be best for bitcoins future I've never mined I've only bought as a long term investment. 
My fear and why I'm treating it as a doomsday is for the simple fact that there is 2 options that the community is so split that people are willing to put up false nodes to support there cause and throw money at people so they can get behind there Movement. 
I'm basically at the point where I bought in at sub 100. 2k ain't a bad way to go out. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:17:03
The purchasing of the bitcoins is not what will get you legally it will be the converting them back into fiat. 
Edit : congrats on 500k only being 10% of your net worth!
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:37:02
I've been a hodler for years, but this past month I've been selling off a good amount way more then I had ever planned to this early, simply for the fact that I don't know what's going on. I've tried to figure out seg wit and forks and all that but from everything I've read it just sounds like 2 sides are far apart and no one knows what the hell is going to happen. I hope it all works out and bitcoin is the future but I also don't wanna be standing with my dick in my hand as bitcoin crashes. 
Just an opinion from an observer who has a lot of bitcoins I have no sides on the fork debate 
I'm treating it as a doomsday. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:21:07
I never said anything bad about eth - etc or any other alt currency, but they each have  there own sub Reddit for those exact currencies, and this post literally has nothing to do with bitcoin.  
So it's like going to a Yankees fan board and saying I just bought season tickets at Fenway see you in Boston. I mean congrats but how does that post provide any meaningful discussion or progress in the world of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:07:32
You just came to a red soxs party and said the Yankees are gonna do well this year.

To piggy back of this, my opinions are coming from someone who was in bitcoins for the money and the investment. While I whole heartedly agree with the people behind the movement to get away from centralized banks and wanting a to have true financial freedom, it's just not something I'm that passionate about. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:24:42
If not enough people activate segwit I'm under the impression it will split weather it comes back together or not is the million dollar question.

Had a buddy sign up 2 days ago he's still waiting too, same on kraken but I'm thinking if you weren't signed up before this week on most exchanges your gonna have a longer wait then usual.

Don't think Warren Buffet ever went to r/stock markets and asked for a loan 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:29:50
Well before this week people would've told you Coinbase, Gemini or Bitstamp but at this point with all of the verification waiting times and outtages your best bet to get into bitcoins the quickest is to see if there is a bitcoin ATM around. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:22:09
Legally regarding taxes not criminally.

I felt like that, part of the reason I made a Reddit account this week and have read  and asked, while some people are hardliners and will just give you one side occasionally you'll get a good non biased answer that explains it a little better.

You can be hacked, someone can take your password or scam you but if someone just to tried to brute force there way into your account it would take the NSA super computer about 1k years.

Mark Cuban having a 10 minute back and forth conversation on twitter about accepting Btc for season tickets and being a bubble is for sure what caused the price dip, not any of the Asian markets. Make sure to get all your quality bitcoin news on CNBC

Also coin base has been known to suspend and shut down accounts for money laundering and gambling. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:59:04
Government agencies have spent a lot of money and  have become increasingly good at being able to track bitcoin payments and if your using coinbase its basically a head start for them. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:48:54
I think both the article and your picture of a 12hour graph are not an accurate representation of what's going on.

To be honest gdax is usually anywhere from 200-50 dollars higher on average then polo and bitterex a lot of he times so you would be losing even more by sending to someone other then gdax 
Playing the arbitrage game right is crucial when it comes to transferring and cashing out

The price didn't dip as dramatically on polo as it did on gdax. I've seen various complaints about polo, none that I've personally had but I don't think I can remember seeing anyone saying they defaulted on there loans or loaners weren't paid back.
