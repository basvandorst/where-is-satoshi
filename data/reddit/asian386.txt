Is there a way to scan your computer on BTC keys? I think I received 30$ worth of BTC from a site a very long time ago. Not sure If i got it send as a private key though. But I know I never downloaded a wallet to receive them. So only way would be that I got a private key direct right, or can a site give BTC without them having acces to? otherwise that wallet would be empty by now lol.

There are HODLers who sold for a loss. They HODLed for a long time but not long enough.

Lol! Ethereum worked exactly as it should. The people who wrote the DAO code wrote the code wrong and somone took advantage of! You don't know much I see...
Anyway all the big companies like the fact that Ethereum could fix the so called hack! Now they are all all in on ETH!
BTW: did you ever heared about the BTC code being broken? They could create as many BTC as he wanted! So stop ur bs, ETH will skyrocketh! And you will miss out. Like most of you , though many will realize ETH is the next big thing soon!

In my opinion we are starting to see a trend in exchanges doing the right thing and paying back the stolen/hacked money. Great for the crypto space :)

ETH is backed by a smartcontract platform. BTC is backed by nothing. The more people will use EThereum the more stable the currency becomes. In the end it will be the digital gold....and not BTC.
BTC has 1 hour transaction times lol, ETH has 13 seconds.....BTC will never be widely used, ETH will take over within 2 years.

To be honest It could be true that a site gave it but that I didn't do the stuff they asked me to do to get the coins. Fuck lol. I'm trying to remember what really happened.
If I find them I invite you to my island where I have some big titties porn stars!
