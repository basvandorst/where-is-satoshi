If you'd like to have an interesting and productive talk about crypto, I'm very much willing to exchange some PMs to discuss the crypto world. I speak Korean as well.

Don't get me wrong, I am a proponent of btc myself. Let me ask you a question though: by your logic (if we disregard tech and view bitcoin as an investment vehicle), couldn't you argue the same for the vast majority of other cryptos? Their values are going up as well.

Over the years, the crypto market will balance out until it reaches equilibrium. It's safe to say once that happens, the volatility of crypto will be significantly lower than the state we find it in today (crypto is still a very immature technology, and there is much mania surrounding the fray which greatly increases volatility). You're right, right now due to a number of various issues including but not limited to politics, infrastructure, and adoption, cryptocurrencies aren't frequently used as a form of currency YET. But in ten years time, it's probably a safe bet to say the market won't be as volatile and cryptos as a form of true currency will be a reality.

Settling off chain happens very quickly because it isn't limited by the network, but rather the exchange or medium you are using. Any transaction made on exchanges tend to be extremely fast, and hts should be no exception. Transaction times and fees become a problem when bitcoin is being exchanged directly, because you are no longer settling outside the blockchain. If the mempool is overloaded , you either have to pay more to settle quickly, or you have to get in line like the rest of the world. 언더스텐?
