Well, if people start to accept Bitcoin directly and start to spend it to each other as a somewhat small community is successfully doing already it would look different. This small community is growing and growing. It's only a question of time.

@_date: 2019-02-07 09:04:57
Possible. I really can't explain that. Yes, i had the option of compiling the old version my self or download it from Aptoide.. thankfully, the signature gets checked there and it was a safe version. And it worked.
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:17:48
If might be coming soon. There will be Coins for persons directly, and you will be able to invest in people themselves. I can see a Chuck Coin a Elon Coin, a Antonopoulous Coin... it's going to be great!

@_date: 2018-11-03 01:22:28
Okay i will try! so basically, in the seed extension the passphrase and in the passphrase nothing?

Who or what is Echevaria? I can see it is a flower... TLDR?
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:59:50
yes... i thought they are good.. i actually liked them and their philosophy. Very sad. Also their response when i asked for help says a lot.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:21:49
Sadly no, i didn't use any of the many functions like PayNym, routing &amp; co. I just used it super simple as a everyday wallet
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:16:52
Good idea, sadly this was the first thing i tried the day after i lost access, it didnt worked. I actually hoped my Samourai data would just be backed up when i restored the beta, but it was also not the case sadly.
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:47:59
I tried a bit with the  tool.
I also tried to add the seed with the pin at the end, as mentioned in the thread with the user having the same problem. i tried with and without space, However no success yet.
Do you have any idea how i should do it, maybe i am making a mistake there?
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:34:42
But were you able to solve it? or are you also still searching for the solution? 
And if yes, HOW did you solve it? ��
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:15:23
Sadly i tried it already with no success ��
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:15:11
thank you very much! i received a lot of help and we are actively trying to figure it out. There must be a way! I'll not give up! thanks for your help, time and wishes!
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:24:25
Thank you for your time, help and the great detailed description.
Sadly, i tried that already. And yes, usually that means the password must be wrong or something, but it is definitely not the case, which makes this whole thing so damn strange...
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:18:17
First transaction came from a non segwit paperwallet, then i only used segwit. The last transaction before i lost access, was a non segwit paperwallet transaction again. I can't even say if that has anything to do with it.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:20:14
Thank you for your help, time and idea!
Basically that means a former Samourai APK would be sufficient, right?
On the other side, when i lost access, the app wasn't updated, it was the same as before
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:42:03
i actually restored the Android 9 Beta and hoped that my data is safed in there. Sadly It was not the case �� 
where can I find old APKs from Samourai? i would love to try this out! I must still be sure that the APK is officially from Samourai. I will check on APK Mirror now.
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:58:17
I really hope you are right. I can see the coins waiting for me.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:12:47
Oh damn, what is your story? I'm still actively searching to figure it out, but ideas are running out. It just makes absolutely no sense... 
But we will not give up!
@_date: 2018-11-03 03:10:36
Were all your transactions gone too? as if you were using a new wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:08:24
Hello Laurent,
Thank you very much for your help, i will answer on my last conversation with Samourai and add the link to this thread.
I tried a lot and I couldn't help myself anymore then asking here for help and hope someone has a idea.
thank you!
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:43:10
I tried it already, same 0 BTC, 0 Transaction history.
As i see here in this thread, it says i need to add my pin after the mnemonic, which makes it even stranger:
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:58:35
That makes me very sad to read, it is absolutely not my intention to smear or make Samourai look bad. As i said, i actually liked the wallet and their philosophy and never had Problems!
I would ask the same question with any wallet where a bug like this happens,  I'm just a user that can't access his coins anymore with out reason, thats all. I'm saying the truth and only the truth here and dont intend to smear any one. I am just asking for help after trying everything i could've thinked of.... ��
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:26:13
thank you very much!! I'll check both options!
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:50:39
Yes, but how would you explain that after successfully restoring it 3 times already? It is really very strange. Otherwise i would say exactly the same
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:32:53
Thank you very much Laurent, i answered to my last conversation with Samourai from 6th of June.
Yes, i also think it has something to do with the Android 9 Beta and/or the segwit to non segwit  transaction. 
When i had the beta installed, Samourai always crashed when i opened it. That was also a reason why i had to go back to stable. And then the "horror" began.
It's really super strange.
i still have hope and don't give up.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:10:33
Absolutely. Anything positive about Bitcoin gets downvoted. Mentioning the clear fake FUd results in downvotes (like this comment). I wonder who orchestrates these things? Whoever does it... earns much, much Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:56:38
Yes, super strange, haven't heard of something like that too and only found it out in this thread after countless researching. Yes, i really have the feeling that i will get access to these Bitcoin again.. but who knows when and how... At the moment i have absolutely no idea ����
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:40:08
If i just knew it earlier... Samourai seemed to be nice and i liked their philosophy. 
But the Bitcoin are not stolen yet, i can see them laying and waiting for me in the address! I just can access them anymore, there must be some bug in Samourai
@_date: 2018-11-06 23:34:46
Sure, i installed it on the 25th or 24th of November
Password Manager used was KeePass through the Keepass for Android app.
i will actually really contact google, and ask if there is anyway they have my full data  backed up somewhere. I dont believe it, but it is worth a try.
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:19:04
Yes, it almost seems like someone paid these coordinated attacks and dislikes on everything posititive about bitcoin or comments disposing these attacks. its really strange
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:11:46
Thank you for your help and your great idea! 
Both, the first and the last transaction were offline generated paperwallets.
I'll check this function and see if it helps! I used the IanColeman Tool and checked the first 200 addresses actually, but i will try it in Electrum too. Let's see!
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:35:09
I have seemingly lost money with Samourai too.. ��
Here is my story : 
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:08:49
nothing... No access. What happened to you?
@_date: 2018-11-03 05:18:26
Thank you for the idea and tip! Sadly i tried that already + hoped my data would be safed too and i just restore completely. Sadly no. also trying to restore in that environment helped nothing ��
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:14:05
I tried that already.. i tried a lot already. It seems that i am victim of a strange yet unknown bug. Another person with the same Problem was found now too. Its super strange.

Great, thank you very much for your help!
i checked both, bip 39 &amp; extended seed. should i leave the seed extension empty? 
and derivation should be m44 (legacy), right? or 49?, or something different? 
i will try them all.
i will also try with a space at the end of the last word. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:47:19

@_date: 2018-11-03 00:20:45
Correct, i have the Seed + the corresponding Passphrase. 
I only use the tool offline in tails out of fear of the coins getting stolen. I then checked it with Sentinel, to see if it finds Bitcoin, but no success yet.
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:53:33
The coins are not stolen, they are just not accessible anymore out of unknown reasons
