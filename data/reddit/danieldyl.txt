No leader chose him, the people elected him for the assembly in 2015 and now as the president of the assembly and without a legitimate president he take the legal oath to become an inteeim president and go to real elections. He is not even the leader of his party he will not be a candidate... this are the facts.

Venezuela has not been a democracy for years since there is no separation of power.

He was elected in 2015 as part of the congress, and as the president of the assembly and without recognized elections he is legally the president according to the venezuelan constitution. NEXT

Elections that were held illegally... so completely irrelevant, like you.

You should read the Venezuelan constitution, you will see it was totally legal !!! He swore the oath as the President of the AN in front of the two vicepresidents of the AN and the people in the Cabildo way which is in our constitution. The dictator is Maduro, why? Because he illegaly change judges of the Supreme Court, he illegaly creared the ANC which gave him power that belongs to the legislation power, he denied the right of the referendum to revoke him, he put in jail opposition leaders, who were even majors, governors and deputies with inmunity. He took loans withouth the legislation permission. He denied the opposition to be part of the last elections and were held by a partial committe which was supposed to be changed by the AN but they dictator did not allow it. He is been acting as a dictator since 2015, and you defend tyranny, starvation, scarcity and hyperinflation. More people died in Venezuela in comparison to Syria which is a war zone. Well, lad, if you can be called like that, you are a disgrace if you support Maduro.

Yes let's give the gold to the dictatorship so they can steal the rest of the national reserves !!! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:14:08
Yes. Maduro is a thief, he and all of his cabinet for years since Chavez. They took private companies, destroyed them, took all the money now storaged in places like Andorra. They took advantages of having a regulated currency exchange. And the reserves went all down.

Yes... keep fooling yourself.

You are trying telling a Venezuelan this? I'm Venezuelan, it's not a coup I already told you why, read my constitution if you are "pretty sure", pathetic. Venezuela has oil, and its production has fell down thanks to our corrupt government. If you defend Maduro, you defend dictatorship, you defend starvation, hyperinflation and scarcity. What a moron, just because U.S choose to accept our constitution it doesn't mean it's a conspiracy.

Thank you, I'm just trying to bring real facts so people that are not well informed can read them, in the other hand, its true they will not listen, my words are directed to them, but I hope people with common sense will read them also.
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:17:34
That's all you got? Who hurt you... keep lying to yourself, I'm Venezuelan, I know the facts.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:53:05
Well, you don't really know what are you talking about. Venezuela wasn't sanctioned. The sanctions are against the people in the government who stole national money and used it the U.S.
