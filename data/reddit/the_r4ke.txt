And that we didn't land on the moon?

I bought and used some in 2013, but my remainder got lost when the site crashed and I was never able to get it back. I'm still upset about it.

Thank you for that explanation, I knew that this picture had to be taken out of context.
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:02:01
I absolutely agree.

I think that's different though. What I mean is companies holding devices hostage or limiting their function for profit. I'm pretty sure it's already illegal to hack medical devices.
@_date: 2016-10-10 07:47:00
I'm talking about the latter. Companies either locking access to product or limiting it's functionality until they receive money.

I imagine there'll be legislation passed to prevent this kind of stuff. Especially for any of the things that could result in somebodies death.
@_date: 2016-10-10 07:56:16
Unfortunately, that's definitely true.

Lol, no. That's not how society works.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:44:45
I never said I enjoy or approve of society. I just don't want random a-holes having a say in how I live my life.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:37:25
Yeah, and if they're libertarian which seems likely, it seems inconsistent that they don't want the government involved in their lives, but they want to personally have a say in other peoples lives.

I lost around 20 BTC back in 2013, I'm still salty about it. I think it was when Paperwallet fell apart, I sent them a request for a refund but they never replied.
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:44:08
I only had .68 bitcoins, so I won't be devasted if I can't get it  back, but it was fun to have them.

So I just found out yesterday that I'm pretty sure my wallet got hacked because I get a 404 error when I type go to my URL. How do I got about submitting a claim, I only have .68 BTC so it's not a huge loss, but I'd like to get them back if I can.

I used BitCopia to purchase some bitcoins a few months ago, it was really easy, you just go to the website tell them how much you want to buy, and they'll give you the info to take to the bank and make a cash deposit, it was in my wallet in about 30 minutes. I look at it as a fun investment right now. I would only put in as much as your willing to lose, but it was a lot of fun to watch my money increase in value rapidly. I think it has a lot of potential, but if it never goes mainstream I'll be okay.
