This is great popcorns ready :) If things doesn`t work for you I know good shelter for abandoned cats. Do you think they kicked you out beacuse it is getting really hot and they don`t want fried animals?
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:34:15
Yup. It is hard to believe for most people that is all natural because almost all products have some kind of chemistry in it unlike your products. I see some new ones in the store ;)

Keep up the good work. Cheers!

Well it is difficult question to answer for many reasons. At start it was great but then greed kicks in and you start to experiment with other coins and then you just multiply your risk and break even time. Also I have national currency in which I pay electricity bills which is heavily connected to EUR and of course volatile because of crap goverment. My original break point was 3-6 months but that was only an illusion because I never could imagine that difficulty will spike so much and price plummet at the same time. I just want to give friendly advice to furkansener. If you want to acquire bitcoins safest and best way is to just buy it and then you can play with them on exchanges. That way you are not exposed to risks with equipment and ROI.

I can only say that sauces are great! And really hot by the way...

Yeah info would be great...
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:27:08
You said stickers! Here they are  and for every pack you get extra one`s too!
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:01:55
People lets get real. First I do not take seriously accusations made by government because their goal is to speak bad about Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general. They do not understand new technologies and therefore they are afraid what might happen in the future but that is inevitable.
If the system is working properly and payments are processed I don`t give a f*ck if Charlie smoked weed or other guy screwed up government for tax or similar. That doesn`t mean that Bitcoin is bad.
My 5c. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:13:35
That is very bad, but they might have some real issues with your account nonetheless you can always use other exchanges... ANXBTC is doing great job so far...

@_date: 2014-11-03 19:36:23
Not available in Serbia too... I thought ok we are blacklisted everywhere but now I see that it is not available anywhere outside US. Great job Circle, great job... And Bitcoin should bring us together and empower financial freedom but this is hilarious...
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:52:21
They are both and also they have their own mining pool. They want to consolidate all services that Bitcoin needs. Keep up the good work BTCC!

Hi everybody I am speaking as part of customer service on Bitsticker.net. 
As for proposals for new stickers it would be best to show here hires pictures that we can print later. We will make a poll for new stickers and ones with most votes are going to be printed. 
We are currently printing new batch of stickers with new ones and YES there is Doge in two sizes and two variants. So keep an eye on our socials and news on our web site. As soon as they enter our office they will be placed on web site for ordering.
Also I want to point out that we are going to give away coupons for discount on stickers when new batch arives.
Thanks everyone for the support especially viridianlion who made this topic here.
@_date: 2014-05-21 10:28:18
Same thing I tought... but it is probably KNC or someone similar.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:40:43
10% discount is nothing... 50% discount would rock the planet big time... and in the long run it would be great for buyer and the company that is selling for BTC...
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:56:59
If you read a little about these projects you would not wrote such nonsense... I would also add twister which is p2p microblogging platform like twitter but decentralized and with own blockchain...

Hello did your stickers arrived? If not please contact us via contact form. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:06:03
Great, I will buy again for sure. I can say that sauces are great and there is nothing similar on the market. Also I tried Killer Swarm and it is very very veryyyyyy hot. Keep up the good work man!

It depends do you want ATM portable or not...
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:51:01
Looks good... I would polish bottom part a little more... Also it would be great to implement properly for all screens... You should contact them and see if they want facelift for official web site.
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:41:22
That is great, we are happy when our customers are satisfied :)

Well I had to express my gratitude and happiness. Also a lot of people want to buy Sublime with Bitcoin and now they can. Cheers!

They will absorb everything... keep up with voting because everyone benefits if they accept bitcoin.

Didn`t know that... Can you provide some link to that info?
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:31:58
Noooooo why would he do that :)
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:02:38
This is the best answer that I seen for questions like this. I totally agree and I am mining from early 2014 with two S2 rigs. They are payed 15 BTC at that point directly from Bitmain. I would also add that I never speculated on bitcoin price and only when needed exited to FIAT for bils etc. have a donut on me
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:50:49
There are numerous xxx sites that accept Bitcoin, also there is Wankcoin which is accepted on several major sites like porn.com and similar. So it is happening in porn industry but slower than anticipated...
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:51:40
Yes indeed :)
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:40:27
I do not understand what do you want me to explain... It is simple for start to accept BTC via Bitpay or Coinbase and have live calculation of their USD priced products... For some advanced stuff they would need their own infrastructure and connecting accounts with BTC addresses. And with which part you do not disagree. I can not have credit card or paypal and therefore I can not buy products on steam and because of that I must use third party to do that...
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:59:04
you could post it on badbitcoin.org
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:27:02
Why would they be an exchange? If they hook up with Bitpay they would get USD and everyone happy... After when they feel how everything works and understand possibilities then they could do more advanced stuff for other parts of ingame economies.
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:52:00
Because price determines how much you can buy with your holdings. I only earn Bitcoin and for me price determines almost every aspect of my life. Also Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general offered me(us) chance to do business worldwide and since I am not from country where banking, Paypal or other types of payments are normal and provide full services for low cost. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:50:19
I am also getting this for a while never checked if there is a message attached...
@_date: 2015-05-17 12:59:30
Airbitz is way to go, great app.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:58:32
That is logical move for them. There was also another older thread where one user claimed it is not possible for them to implement Bitcoin now. I can not know what and how much that user is familiar with Bitcoin and payment systems. But for starters Steam can do same thing as Microsoft. Make Bitpay integration for buying USD or products directly. That is almost zero cost, zero knowledge and zero waiting that way...
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:59:47
Great work! I almost peed myself at the end... and its gone! :D

@_date: 2014-08-08 15:09:12
Looks good to me... just watch out how and where are you pointing your users...
@_date: 2015-05-17 13:13:04
Why they don`t use Bitreserve? Then they can lock value to USD or whatever they want.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:25:43
There are number of services that offer debit cards that you can load with bitcoin. I personally have ANX and E-coin card. For me E-coin is much better because it is faster and you can see history of your activity. They also send you email with every action that you make.

@_date: 2014-07-27 08:14:45
Very interesting panel... now I partially understood situation in China and I did not know they have so low fees in their payment networks. 
First of all they are investing in mining because all the manufacturers and foundries are there, second they want to have as many BTCs and network strength as they can, we can not put aside that Bitcoin is some kind of western invention that wants to poison chinese people (what a joke).
After all this being said my question is if China wants to make more money they need to look at the whole world as market and they can not use RMB or Alipay or Union Pay... And it is stupid not to accept BTC as merchant in China in same manner as in other parts of the world.
Also in which currency mostly Chinese companies get their money from export?

Interesting talk with a lot of similarities with bitcoin. I really think that this is not Satoshi although I may be wrong. As someone noted highly unlikely... Satoshi had a lot of resources that he could use for his invention and that does not mean everyone of people that were in those projects are Satoshi nor they know who he is...
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:47:17
Congrats, that is how we decentralize :) I also made full node on some spare parts laying around server.

Yup april fools joke for sure... but I would not disregard something like this to happen in the future. I do not know if Greece will be country that will do something like this but banks are more and more in trouble and easy exit would be turning over to bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:20:08
Well it depends what type of mining reward you are expecting. There are different models on various pools. I tested out biggest pools with same hash power and come to conclusion that F2pool payouts were best and constant through time during the test. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:40:28
I did not speak about you only for general thinking and expressing here on r/Bitcoin. Your attitude is perfectly fine and that is how you need to look at new technology and try to use it how you see fit.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:47:15
That may be true but that can be said for any government... Question is do they want to improve their economy or to destroy it even further... We all know what banks are doing with interest rates, loans, deposits etc.

Probably because of "grandpa" style bike :)

When you buy bitcoins on Circle or Coinbase it is wise to move the out of there...

Well it is a matter of technical implementation... I personaly think da combination of multisig and time lock could prevent most of fraud. As for question of reputation that is also relevant and important but I would also add trusted notaries like Bitrated to improve security...
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:04:19
That is true but with far superior security than changetip...
