This seems like a terrible idea. Money in politics is already bad as it is.

Not very technically savvy but apparently larger block size leads to the mining pool that previously mined the block to have a head start on mining the next block because the other inning pools have to verify the recent block. That leads to more centralization of mining.

Someone has to be an adult and pay the bills. Unless you live above the arctic circle in Alaska you shouldn’t be complaining about taxes.

Damn get off your high horse. Don’t need to speak so condescendingly just because he doesn’t share your same values. BTC is not only about anonymity. It’s digitization of wealth, freedom of movement, security etc.

It's money that can't be duplicated and is verified and recorded by anybody who wants to that has an internet connection. It's a communal banking system that no one person or figure has authority over. Banks and govts can lock your money but the only person who can move your bitcoin are the ones that have your private key (ideally only you). You can never lose your bitcoin unless you forget the 24 recovery word. Bitcoin is not stored on a computer or your phone. The only thing stored on your device is your private key which allows you to move your bitcoin.

Depends on how tech savvy you are. If you are comfortable running linix then it should be okay. If you lose your hardware wallet you are still good as long as your have your seed words.

It doesn’t have Bitcoin it has “Bitcoin core” what exchange sells btc as “Bitcoin core”?

Even in America this problem exists. I worked a part time job last summer and there was a 30 year old that just opened a bank account for the first time. Having a bank account is tough if you don’t have direct deposit.

Institutions didn’t pump this hard to sell at 11k the real FOMO hasn’t even started yet.

Hardware wallets keep your keys disconnected from the internet. You can still receive but if you want to send you need your hardware wallet to access the keys. USB is just a diy hardware wallet. Software wallets are more convenient since the keys are on your internet enabled device but are more susceptible to hacks. Just remember “wallets” on exchanges are not real wallets as you do not have the private keys.

If you can stay sovereign on your own land then sure. But as long as you need an army to help defend your sovereignty then you need to pay taxes.

I’m just as bullish as the next guy but we are still a while away from rubbing it in their faces. The first major step is to break 6.4k.

Misleading hopium charts like this make me think we are still in a bear market.

Maybe a program that can move your bags that are on the exchange to another wallet.

You won’t make money off this. I’m bullish in btc so I’m in for the long. I got a feeling this is the end of the bear season so buy what you can. Don’t get excited over a 2% swing.
If you want to make quick money in shorts you are better of with BCH but if you don’t know what you are doing you could burn yourself.

BHC tried to high jack the BTC brand when it forked. Satoshi is not behind BCH, he is anonymous for a reason. Coins fork when a new feature is added that is not backwards compatible. BCH forked from BTC b/c it wanted change. Now that ABC and SV have different ideas and philosophies and could not come to a consensus so now they are having a war. The miners (large company of miners) that mine BTC and BCH have to use their resources to fight the ABC SV war which is unprofitable so the BCH people have to dump their BTC to fund the war.

You have to wait on cb pro unless you do a wire  transfer. CB is instant but you need to pay the fee and can’t withdraw till the cash clears

When the internet was first available to the public it was shit and niche. Even in the 90s most people didn’t have an internet connection. You never know when it comes to these things.

Lol just look at the recent binance hack a month ago. They had an inside man or bribed cellphone carrier employees to transfer the victims number to a different SIM card. They also phish for email passwords and delete all notifications. Two factor authentication isn’t enough when there are hundreds of millions worth of bitcoin that can be stolen.
