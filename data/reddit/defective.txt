Dear graph maker,
If you can get an iPhone 6 for $199, you should have no problem selling it to me for $300, right? I will buy as many iPhones from you as you can sell me.

Hi! You seem to be assuming a rational actor here (with a diversified portfolio). What you actually have here is a gentleman who has invested a fair chunk of money into Bitcoin, in 2015, after watching a documentary, which makes ME think maybe he ain't got a tight ETF game, etc.

Southern Vapery seems to be defunct.  
Coval Vapes makes no mention of Bitcoin on their site and doesn't appear to accept anything other than credit cards in the checkout process.
Hookah On Mars has no Bitcoin option in checkout.

Jesus, it's not dwolla, it's your fucking shitty-ass bank account that's slow.
*Also, have fun when Paypal shuts down your account on suspicion of buying/selling bitcoins against their TOS.

More like, it's a geeky-ass excuse to build an absolutely *insane* rig that my fiancee can't say crap about because it will eventually be free...

Have you not heard the world ends tomorrow?  People are just liquidating to fund their final parties.

Aww, that's so cute, your statistic.  It's gained over 1000% in 1 year.
@_date: 2011-06-03 04:26:25
I dunno, but shoots, lets blame Dwolla.
@_date: 2011-06-03 01:24:42
You're welcome.
Like I fucking could.  Come get me.
I have no idea.  My bank is slow too.  Dwolla is the good part of the financial industry, if anyone is.  Blame ACH.  Read a book.
@_date: 2011-06-03 13:51:11
Isn't the banking system Dwolla's fault?  Or have I been reading what the OP wrote incorrectly? 
...I'm being sarcastic.  Sorry for wasting your time.

Neither of those are used in mining particularly, so feel free to go cheapo (whatever your OS requires).  I'd recommend a dual core processor minimum if you ever intend to use the computer for anything else ever (like web browsing, even).

You are mistaken in your grasp of my sentence.  If, on November first, 2010, I purchased 100 bitcoins for USD$34 or thereabouts (that's around the closing price on that day), they are today worth USD$319, or 938% of what they were worth 365 days ago.  My statistic above was correct at the time it was written.  Yes, in June or July, they were worth over USD$3000, but it would have been silly of me to point that out, just as it was silly for Phokus to point out that it would have been dumb to buy on top of a bubble and then sell at the bottom, and base his entire opinion of bitcoin on this obvious fact.

Can you tell me *\*twitch\** what the M in ATM means?
@_date: 2011-05-14 08:27:31
Also, it has blinky lights and goes *whirrrrrrrrrr*.

Jesus christ, man, he's ignorant, not illiterate. Just like you are. Too bad you have to add assholery to ignorance.

What the hell is "mathematically-declined"?  Is that what happens to me the week after my calculus final?
