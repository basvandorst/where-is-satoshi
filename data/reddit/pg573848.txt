I thought it was made to be an anonymous and anonymous to buy way to get your hands on online goods. None of this idealistic stuff that gets thrown around no matter what the developers rationalised it as. THat was what made it popular, now it's just gone down the toilet IMO.

I think that the regulation, even supported by the crypto community, destroys its' value as an anonymous payment method.

Thank you, looking into it

I can verify, it's gone to shit. Even cash traders, and the site, require nearly always ID verification.

Sounds accurate, I've seen some pretty insane markups for cash.

Most still have their own policy requiring some form of ID or a membership that then requires ID

I always knew that, you are correct, but it really makes me think that there will be a new resurgence of sites that accept other methods that require only first-party authentication, like Western Union (requires only ID verification from the payee.)

I'm surprised that never actually occurred to me. I generally like my brains' ideas.

Australia doesn't have that many

I misread this as KFC, not gonna lie.
@_date: 2018-07-10 07:31:17
Fair points.

Thanks for the good reply

I'm not in New Zealand bro

Appreciate x10. Exploring now.

Hence why would anybody bother with bitcoin, when Western Unicorn is equally as good, and any bank transfer or prepaid CC is just as anonymous, if not more so? Bitcoin seems to be going down the drain.

This answer is the best one so far. Once the government regulated BTC, it went to hell as a currency, on par with normal currency.
