If you are worried, then you've got too much invested.

Haven't all bubbles been smaller percentage wise as the one before? The last bubble was not in the same ball park as the bubble of a couple of cents to $1. It requires a lot more capital to make the same percentage wise jumps and someone has to pay for it... Regardless, my point was that a jump to 2x the previous ATH feels like bubble territory again.

This mentality I don't understand. [How can you look at this and claim this is not yet another bubble]( Was there some big fundamental change - am I missing something?

Wouldn't a rational agent choose to do so despite deflation due to clear technological advantages? For example, people still buy Windows despite Linux being available for free, because of ease of use. Granted, we're not there yet, but it doesn't take much imagination to see how payment systems based on the Bitcoin protocol would be much easier and cheaper than traditional systems (which is already the case for the tech savvy).
Also, I'm not an economist, just a computer science guy so forgive me for my ignorance, but why is spending considered a good thing by economists? Wouldn't you want people to save their resources and to only spend when they really value a product instead? Wouldn't that increase the pressure for innovation and lead to a more sustainable economy?

I just integrated the  API. Would recommend. Very straightforward if you know a little bit how to code.

It is for merchants, due to the lack of chargebacks.

Bitstamp could avoid these types of scams by e.g. simply adding an XFO response header...
