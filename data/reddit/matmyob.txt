You’re right. I just assumed that with your combined arrogance and ignorance that you were American. My mistake. 
So it looks like your British, so some U.K. statistics then? Less than 12% of people in the U.K. have more than £50,000. No where near 250,000 USD. So pull your head out.

More than [50% of U.S. citizens]( have savings less than $1000. You need to get some perspective on your wealth.

It's back up

Haha, fair enough mate.

Oh yeah, I totally stuffed up that explanation.

edit: I stuffed up this explanation (sorry), I was stupidly looking at decimal separator. For thousands, I can only find [this]( link.
It seems a lot of large population countries do use a comma separator (like India and China, SE asia, Japan, and Commonwealth countries) but not necessarily as a thousands separator, it depends on the region, and other methods are also used (like spaces).
But using 1.000 for one thousand seems limited to a few European countries.
I haven't found info on other parts of the word.
~~I was surprised to hear "most countries" use 1.000. Had to [look it up](
Seems most (ex) Commonwealth countries (incl. India) + USA + South East Asia + Middle East + China + Japan + Southern Africa~~
~~**1.000:** Continental Europe, South America and North Africa.~~
~~So it seems by area it's about 50/50 (would be nice to check without distorted map), but by population most use 1,000.~~
