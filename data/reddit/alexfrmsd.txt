hm ok well 1st off here buddy it seems you have a habit of just shitting on people who are new to this sort of thing so ill take what youre saying with a grain of salt . 2. its called dipping your toe in and learning something new if i have to learn the hard way then so be it. 3.the only way to truly learn something is to start off from a position of as much ignorance as possible 4. when you can get to a point in your life where a couple grand doesnt mean a whole lot to you , youll have better things to do then try to shit on people looking for advice . have a nice day.
