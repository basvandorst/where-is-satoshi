True story. I really hate these comparisons.... it’s just stupid because less than 1% of us would have been sitting on the gains... most of us would have sold at + 1000 % or less...

Love it!

that's how it is in crypto world. 
When price corrects you have these stupid thoughts that "a bubble" is popping and you wait until it's green again. 
Just buy low and sell high, without any piece of mind. Look at the red/green numbers and buy/sell without thinking about loosing the money you want to invest. 
Human mood plays you tricks

100% privacy!
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:59:39
unbelievable... Such a shame for germany....
I am so glad that there are new exchanges getting started like liberalcoins.com where customers privacy is still important

because you would have pulled it out 3 months later... A few days ago i read something very smart: It's not just one decision to put your money into something and become wealthy. You have to make the same decision over and over again. When you make 1000% profits and when you make 1000% losses... You always have to keep your money in, and don't be greedy or afraid.

Such spelling. So money

Nobody should ever put all their cash into BTC... 


that's another story. It's day trading in crypto... Some call it gambling ...

Why is it in English? In Pakistan?

Germany wins again! That’s the right track

It’s wonderful how he adds the coins from forks directly to the total bitcoin amount. He might be right if he takes the mean value of all bitcoins + coins from forks, but that would be as stupid as adding up apples and pears to find out the total value of apples...
Such a moron

Stop buying for people's sake then please

I agree with the two comments above, but you will pay a fortune in fees for withdrawing your money. I recommend you to register to a p2p exchange e.g., liberalcoins.com and trade your coins for usd. You can also do this locally for cash and therefore keeping all your privacy safe! You shouldn’t offer any information about you or your funds to any of those giant exchanges like Coinbase.

it will due to adoption. As soon as enough people use it daily, BTC will loose it's volatility. The problem here is "use **daily** " as BTC is only a store of value atm. Hopefully that will improve with lightning

Segwit chain is **the** Bitcoin chain. If someone forks that chain you will get the forked coin. If someone forks BCH chain, you have to hold BCH to get the forked coin.

people like it comfortable. As long as the USD is comfortable, they will use it. But one day (see examples like Venezuela, tax rip-off, economical bubbles, total observation and therefore damage of privacy and so on...) using FIAT will be uncomfortable and that's the day bitcoin and friends will rise from ash. People have to be forced by circumstances to use alternatives otherwise we are to lazy and stick to conventional models. That's the difference between pioneers and standard humans.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:48:10
Agreed! It’s great to see pioneer work here. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:57:42
exactly. hopefully everybody will

hope that f***ed up company goes bankrupt for murdering the idea of cryptocurrency. 
Money belongs to the people and must not be regulated by any surveillance company that reports to governments or other pricks

It is trustless. The problem are exchanges and other thieves that require ID verification. If bitcoin was traded the original way, which is p2p, there would be no reason for stronger privacy features.

Hashtags at reddit? Wtf. This is not twitter!!!
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:23:13
For trading you can use p2p exchange liberalcoins.com. They have the lowest fees in the market and you don‘t need all the verification „here is my data, do what you want with it“ shit. 
As a wallet I would buy a ledger for my long term holdings and Exodus as my hot wallet. 
Edit: and for promotion, take the people to one of the high quality meet ups around. There will be one April 11 in the center of London.  See here

Of course it is. I wanted to show a little bit sarcasm :). Who will make you rich, for more or less free?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:43:45
just invest $2 and have a look. If you get daily 9% you'll be rich in a few months

You can't compare standard market to cryptosphere. You will always be disappointed. It's a new era!
