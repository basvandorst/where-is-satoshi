Schnorr is great, but what the heck does a Minkowski space-time diagram have to do with it?

Heard about it sometime back in summer of 2011, from an old roommate. Apparently an acquaintance of his was caught using the computing resources on a research cluster to mine bitcoins, and got his account revoked. I remember thinking, "Wow, what an idiot, who would risk their grad school degree for some useless magic internet money?!". Lol, jokes on me!

2006? You bother searching through your hard-drives, you need to go out to your garage and hop on that time machine thats been collecting dust.

if you are running bitcoin-qt from the command line, just pass it the -datadir option to tell it where you want the data directory to be placed. Let's say you have an external hard drive mounted under /media/myusername/backup,  and you want to store your data on there, just run it like this:
bitcoin-qt -datadir=/media/myusername/backup/bitcoin-core-directory

Take a look at the "Mythical Man-Month". Adding 2x more devs to a project (especially one that has already accumulated a lot of work) does not get it to market 2x faster, more often than not it slows it down...

Sounds like you're talking about MXCNow...those where the days (loved the trollbox)...until they pumped their own exchanges shares to the moon, then anounced they were shutting down, bought them back cheap and ran off with the money. But yes...don't daytrade

[The Dunning-Kruger effect]( it basically boils down to: idiots feel they are smart enough to spout their options boldly, while experts know that they don't know everything and tend to be more reserved

If you move what existing data you already have to the new directory that you are pointing it to you won't need to download it again. However if there is nothing there, then yes, it will download a fresh copy of the entire blockchain and place it there.

dont you think its because they are maybe just the least bit nervous about splitting their entire cold wallet into BTC and BCH? its not hard to do...but with that much riding on the line I would be sweating bullets

If you can sign the transaction using your phone, that means your private key would have to be on your phone, which is probably not what you want for cold storage. 
Instead, create your cold wallet on an air gapped laptop or a netbook with a camera. Then create a second 'watching wallet' on an internet connected computer or smart phone (which also has a camera) using the master public key of your cold wallet.  You can then create a spend transaction using the watching wallet and then display the as-of-yet unsigned transaction as a QR-code. Then read the QR code with your cold-wallet machine's camera to import the transaction, sign it and display the signed transaction as a QR code. You can then load the file signed transaction onto you watching wallet and broadcast it to the network. For a better explaination see [here](

Vitalik Buterin wrote a slightly less mathy article about this back in 2013 (mainly with the electrum wallet in mind, but it applies to any BIP32 wallet). There is a link to it on the bitcointalk page you posted, but it seems to have since moved here:
