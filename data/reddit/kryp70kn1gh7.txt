Are mixers really as safe as just using a coin like monero or zcash? Don't most mixers cost money? I am not knocking your post, I am genuinely curious to know more about mixers and how they work... is it like using the mixer in the dash wallet? To my understanding is that it takes all the users of the mixer's transactions, combines them into a pool(s) of funds, splits up the amounts and sends the amount minus the fee back to the user? I am researching crypto privacy options for an article I am writing, when I saw your post so I just figured that I would ask while I was here, thanks.

I guess only time will tell. Bitcoin does have some of the best developers on the world in the space working on it. Lightning network is coming along. Many projects out there are just copies of bitcoin and older projects like Monero. There are a lot of advanced crypto’s coming out and we may see some of them take off but so far bitcoin is still king of the crypto’s. I like to think of it as the digital gold that backs every other crypto in the space and it seems to be working well for that. I don’t know if we will see that change anytime soon unless a company like Facebook or amazon decides to make a btc form of their own and tries to push it out (which would suck, IMO)

Holy... this is the greatest thing I have ever seen. Do not let me down. Or else.

Cool, thanks for the suggestion and I will certainly bring that up. Great point and I agree 100%. At the same time complete noobs won’t be the only listeners and I want everyone to have the information they need to learn about all aspects of bitcoin. But, yes you are right and I will def have to discuss this and go over lightning enabled mobile wallet options.

Ok, but what is your point? I think everyone that knows anything about crypto understands there are crypto’s with more features than bitcoin (it was made open source so that could even be possible) but that still doesn’t change the fact that bitcoin is worth more than most of them combined and the average person outside of crypto hasn’t heard of any of them.

In order to start a lightning channel you need to run a full bitcoin node and don’t forget to back up your wallet so you don’t lose your money!!
Here is how to setup your full node using bitcoin core and how to back up you wallet:
Follow the instructions so you’ll be ready for the next video I post where I will show how to set up a lightning network channel for anyone interested in contributing to help us grow this network even faster!

I think right now bitcoin is the only crypto with enough brand awareness to be considered an investment grade asset (could be viewed as a personal opinion because coins like ethereum and ripple are trying to catch up) that’s why we see talks of bitcoin futures. Can you explain what you mean by “investment grade”?
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:25:48
Stand the test of time, branding, being the only coin people outside of crypto have ever heard of is worth a lot. Take a look at the market cap of btc compared to any other coin in history and you’ll see how far these coins have to go in order to compete.

Makes sense, they saw that huge rise a year ago and now know how much potential there is to multiply their investment. Probably is a bitmex, coinbase or binance cold wallet like others have mentioned but I like to believe it’s someone like JP Morgan or Bill Gates just filling their bags up, laughing at all of use little people as we all freak out over red candles everyday.
