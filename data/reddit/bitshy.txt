You are correct. If you consider any kind of betting transaction to be spam, then, well, you're not really going to be in the market for this kind of game.
But Satoshi Buckets only performs at most one transaction per new block. In practice, it's a lot less, since most blocks don't result in rounds. So, compared to Satoshi Dice and clones ... Satoshi Buckets is a lot nicer on the blockchain.

Hi everyone. Satoshi Buckets is a new kind of bitcoin betting game. It is not pure luck-based -- there is some strategy involved. It is provably fair, and causes no blockchain spam. The bitcointalk thread is [here]( These are the rules:
-  There are three buckets: red, green, and blue.
-  Put your coins in a bucket. Minimum bet is ฿0.01.
-  Every round (~10 minutes) one bucket falls.
-  The coins in that bucket are distributed among the backers of the other buckets.
-  The buckets that did not fall continue into the next round.
-  Winning buckets can keep winning over and over again!
The promotion is that the house cut is reduced to 0.5% until June 9. This is to help spread the word and let new people try the game, but still be able to pay for the server.
Some testimonials from bitcointalk:










Try it out!

Yeah, it's virtually impossible to accidentally send to the wrong Bitcoin address, unless you copy and paste the entire wrong address. The probability is less than 0.0000000233%.

Wasn't it the DHS that went after Mt. Gox, rather than FinCEN?
