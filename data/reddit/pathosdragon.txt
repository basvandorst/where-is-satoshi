Okay cool, I was just curious. Looks like I’m just stuck saving up until I can afford an ant miner or something similar. I was just curious as to what experienced miners are using as I’d like to get into mining but I’m on a little bit of a budget so currently spending oodles of money isn’t in the cards at the moment. I’d like to mine and put money back into mining, etc etc. but if there are links and such that you’d recommend that I look at, I’d appreciate it
Edit: I see what you’re saying. My bad. I didn’t see that earlier

That makes sense. Thank you

At my home I’m paying .10 per kWh. At the workplace where the server is, I’m paying nothing. Just a small little bonus I’ve gotten from helping set stuff up and providing contacts. Anyway from what I’m understanding from you is that as long as I’m not paying much for electricity and have a specific set up, ie: not my home computer, then there should be some turn of profit? Or did I misunderstand? I know I’m late in the game with this, but I thought I’d give a shot at some of this and see how/where it went

Well I have my computer and a server farm that I have access to that are constantly on. Most of which are run partially on solar. (A set up me and several others have been working on) not for mining, so I was curious as to what anyone who has been mining would recommend cause the server isn’t being used for about 15 hours every day and we were seeing if there was something we could do to try and make a little more money. Sorry my post is all over the place, I’m a little sleep deprived right now

I know a couple of my engineering buddies did but they had a full solar farm on their property before they looked into bitcoin
