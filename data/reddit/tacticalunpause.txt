Have been using IR for months with no issues. Main problem is low volume so prices are a few % inflated sometimes, but thats what we get for using AUD.

That depends on what will happen in the future. Can you predict that?
It will be wise for someone, but my suspicion is that that someone won't be you.

Those words sound like a seed to a private key.
DON'T reveal to anyone what those words are to ANYONE - he could have had loads of bitcoin locked up with that private key.
Keep that SAFE and make a copy of it and store it safely.
Then find out how to generate private keys with seeds, learn about how to use bitcoin, etc.
Only THEN use the seed to generate the private key to your dad's bitcoin wallet. Check the balance and then move those coins safely into a wallet that only you control. If it's any whole number of bitcoin, you're laughing - but ONLY do this once you understand this all - otherwise you risk losing everything.

For every short contract someone has someone else has to have a long futures contract. The CBOE will earn money in brokerage between the two parties.

If you want to find something with 1000x returns, then you're going to have to do your own due diligence - no one here is going to do it for you. If you think it's in crypto, go and read some white papers.

Seriously though, don't kill yourself (and if you don't then just hodl your bitcoin!) It'll bounce back and you have more to live for than bitcoin. Please seek some medical advice. There is a way out of this and it'll be okay in the end.

Best recourse if you can't get verified on an exchange that converts crypto to fiat is... well, part of why bitcoin exists. You can't control this because you can't verify your account. But with bitcoin, you control your money!

I thought my screenshot was good but yours is better.

You could use changelly and put it back into BTC. You could then cash out your new BTC on any Australian exchange, such as Independent Reserve.

Definitely recommend Independent Reserve.

Given that the entire current supply of BTC is only around 18 million, sure, a buy of half a million BTC will swing the market because that's a whole 36th of the entire bitcoin supply.
