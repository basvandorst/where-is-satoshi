there aren't really any good segwit, or batch exchanges that accept bank deposits. gemini is just smaller than coinbase. They don't have those features ether

it also means cash in of itself is an extremely poor investment. interest on savings accounts are so low your money barely maintains value over (a long period) time. you can lock your money into a long term investment and effectively loose any liquidbility, OR you can buy something that maintains or increases value with high liquidity or purchasing power. Like gold, stocks or now cryptocurrency.

I mean lets give their journalist full credit here, There are some ways that bitcoin is a step backwards, like transaction speed.
I think they were trying to condemn bitcoin by saying we've already figured out how to transact money. it just comes at the expense of anonymity, and security. plenty of people see no value in that for some reason

everytime bitcoin goes up rather quickly it has a readjustment period.
something to keep in mind.

it's a bluff. It's generic enough to send to literally anyone.
No name,domain, or time.
and the means of delivery seems unlikely from a computer.

not really, most of it's media like videos which can't give you a virus. If you download a windows crack it could be trojaned but unlikely. kat.cr is worse simply due to the copycat domains. it's definitely better than the limewire days.

I think people unfairly compare visa and btc at least implicitly

Not exactly. Their coke syrup to water ratio is adjusted for the ice. It's one of the reasons McDonald's coke tastes better.

are computers 100% thermal efficient like space heaters? 
if this isn't the case then it still might be more expensive than a space heater even considering the coins you mine. Bitcoin is not really home mining friendly anymore

sorry but this is still far from the case.
visa alone handles 24,000 transactions per second or 150 million daily. We are not  remotely close to that number on money to goods transactions 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:20:12
that's fair assessment.

so this is off topic, but are you also against any form of welfare? welfare systems are usually a form of entrapment creating a system where if they were try to improve themselves they have to put themselves in a worse situation before things get better.

bitcoin isn't anti-capitalist, it is anti-closed market. free market capitalism can exist, bitcoin nether helps nor hinders capitalism by itself.

Thing is, 3% is embedded into everything. You still end up paying for it using cash or crypto. When you use btc your paying btc fees and that 3%

as long as the exchange of goods and services are tied to the local currency and not bitcoin, bitcoin is only as valuable as it's exchange rate in terms of currency.
The technical accomplishments are great but until bitcoin holds a consistent exchange rate it's use as an actual currency is limited.
let's not pretend that BTC going down doesn't hurt it's owners
less exchange value = less purchacing power.

the language he uses is embellished but he has a point.
The banks says you have no money, you have no money good luck proving that otherwise especially with no money. Would they do that on purpose? No, but that's the kind of relationship you have with a bank and if they make a mistake it's on their good will if it gets fixed or not.
it would of been much better if he just said as much but instead he went for cryptic and technical way of saying it.

because doubling $5000, or even $10,000 in **7 years** is something to get thrilled about. Some of these people watched their friends double their money within a year.

the attack surface for such things are already ridiculously large. 
1. Owning a smartphone
2. Owning a laptop with a microphone or camera
3. owning a home media device such an Xbox
4. The given a smart home device such  as amazon echo or google home.
are just a few examples. If you can't have good faith on such a devices only sending queries when asked then you probably also shouldn't own any of these devices Or maybe move out of the country. It's not possible to significantly minimize your attack surface and live optimifically so it's arguably better to take a different approach to solving these kinds of issues like trying to change the privacy laws, supporting open source alternatives when possible (mycroft), and supporting your white hat hackers for keeping companies honest.

people get all spooked about it being a listening device. They counter that it could be listening 24/7 but at the same time most of these people own a smartphone.

This is the most reasonable way to look at it. At the parties purist forms Republicans believe that helping corporatations will cause them to actualize to make this happen while Democrats believe in social programs will help people actualize
But dirty campaign money and tribalism have stalled this divide to the point where nothing gets done anymore
