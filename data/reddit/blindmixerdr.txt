The first 4 transactions checked out ok, so I expect the 5th will be ok too. Thanks for testing.

Thank you for proving that the mixer works as expected. Can you explain what you mean "javascript popup explanations seemed pretty wonky". It is the standard javascript alert() function for best compatibility.

I have clicked on your redeem link and it has been queued. There are only 2 0.1BTC redeems queued, it is set to send when there are 4.
edit: in all your redeems you used always the same receive address. This is just testnet, but for better anonymity you should use a different address each time.

Second Announcement: Trust-free blind bitcoin mixer on TOR -- testnet only -- 0.05BTC reward for testing
The first announcement did not receive much activity, so I try again. There is a new (almost) trust free bitcoin mixing service now online. The service uses Chaum's blind signature algorithm so that nobody, not even the mixer, can associate input coins to output coins. The mixer provides cryptographic proof to the user at every stage of mixing so if the mixer tries to steal your coins or refuses to return them, you can publish the proof to all the bitcoin community.
The service is quite complicated and it is not recommended for newbies yet, but on testnet of course they can try without risking real bitcoins.
At the moment, the service is only available on testnet. If there is demand then prodnet mixing will be enabled (for 0.001BTC at the start).
The service is not intended to be a bitcoin storage service or a bitcoin bank. Any coins left in the mixer for too long (more than 2-6 weeks) will be kept as donations. This gives plenty of time for the user to complete the process and redeem the new mixed coins. This means that the only coins the mixer can steal are coins that are actually being mixed, but if that happens then all the users can prove it. The idea is that the mixer will be successful in the future and it will be obvious that the operators can earn more by staying honest (by donations or fees).
There are 3 main parts in the process:
First you obtain a MixAddress from the mixer and send your coins there (only certain amounts can be mixed: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05... 1.0 BTC).
Second you get a new receive address from your bitcoin client, use the automatic blinding procedure, and upload the blinded address to the mixer aswell as a bitcoin signature of that blinded address (this proves you own the coins).
Third you get a blind signature from the mixer, unblind it, and then upload your receive address and the unblinded signature to the mixer. Then the mixer will put your coins in the queue for sending without being able to connect the user's receive address to the blinded receive address.
All the steps are explained with more details in the instructions link on the website.
The service also provides plausible deniability. All coins returned to users come from an address that is known to belong to the mixer (mrek2NboPP4KTShmLJ8VtakfpoTaQvrD3s for testnet).
There is a reward for testing the service. If you send testnet coins to the mixer, mix them, and receive the mixed coins back, you will receive a bitcointip of 0.05BTC on reddit (real bitcoins, not testnet). To get this, you need to post (on reddit) the Transaction ID of when you send coins for mixing, also with the transaction ID of when you receive the mixed coins, and also the value of the RandomPrime variable (see the instructions on the website to understand this). You may only claim the reward once, but if you use the mixer 5 times, each time for a different value, then by posting these informations for all 5 mixes, you may claim the reward twice. Only user accounts created before April 14th 2013 are allowed to claim the reward. Only 50 rewards will be given.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:31:31
The system logs show that some people have send testnet coins for mixing, and one person managed to complete the process and should have received their new coins back.
Maybe I should have explained more in the first post. This service requires minimal trust in the operators of the mixer. It is not necessary to store coins for a long time, in fact if you leave coins there after the expiry times, they become donations. But the expiry times are far into the future, so there is plenty of time to redeem. It's just complicated.
If BlindMixerDR steals coins from you, you will be able to prove it, by saving all the data at every step of the way. If the user tries to steal coins from BlindMixerDR, we can prove it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:01:31
Yes, but I didn't study it so I don't know how it works. Or if it works.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:25:35
This is a tor based bitcoin mixing service which uses Chaum's blind signing algorithm. It's still in beta testing and only testnet mixing is activated.
Please test it to see if it works. If there is enough demand for it, the prodnet version will be activated.
The first 50 users that tests it will receive a bitcointip of 0.01BTC (real BTC, not testnet), but only users registered before this post will get the bitcointip. You will get 0.001BTC for posting here the transaction ID of the transaction where you send coins to the mixer, and 0.009BTC if you successfully redeem your testnet coins (you need to post the redeem transaction ID and the RandomPrime to prove that you redeemed them).
You are only allowed to claim the bitcointip once, except if you do 5 bitcoin mixings, each one for a different value (0.01BTC, 0.02BTC and so on). After you do 5 mixings and redeem all 5 you will get an extra bitcointip of 0.01BTC - so you have to post 5 redeem transaction IDs and 5 RandomPrimes (see the instructions to understand what the RandomPrime means).
Please browse to the instructions page to see how it works.
Note: this is very advanced. It is not for newbies. It will be made more simple in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:01:11
The site should be online again now.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:07:38
The mixer will only send outgoing transactions when there are several receivers ready - i.e. when several unblinded receive addresses and unblonded signatures have been uploaded. For testnet this is set to a small number, like 2, 3 or 4. I will send the bitcointip as soon as I verify these transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:07:01
I am working now to verify these transactions. Please wait.
Yes, it is unfriendly, that is why it is only for testnet and not for newbies now. It is necessary to keep the javascript window unchanged so it doesn't forget the variables. But at the same time, we need to open pages to the other functions.
edit: there should be only two new pages opening. One to make the 'TxClaim' where you send the blinded receive address for signing, and another where you uploaded the unblinded receive address and signature.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:05:03
Yes. I understand. If there is demand for this service on prodnet, it might be worth to charge fees and provide a more professional interface. On some pages there are question marks or asterisks, on other pages there is something like "Why?" which opens the javascript alert.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:02:30
Eventually. For the moment it's just on tor to see if there is demand for this service.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:54:32
You need to use the tor browser. If you do not know how to use it, then please wait until a more simple version of the site is ready. At the moment it is only for advanced bitcoin users. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:55:20
I am also unable to access it. I have opened a support ticket with the provider. As soon as I have news I will reply.
