I have no agenda and I believe that the crypto market as a whole is in a bubble, the thing is that Bitcoin bubbles by far the most while others are starting to trade normally. Again, as I said multiple times, 3 months ago was the beginning of the speculation and outside hype. It’s VERY different from the market emergence we saw a year ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:57:32
Lmao okay, what’s my agenda? And how is differentiating market stages “cherry picking”? It’s obvious you don’t have a background in economics of any sort so please explain to me how I’m wrong and what you think my goal is
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:06:34
I’m not being snotty, you’ve provided one counter point in this entire discussion. I explained why it was incorrect and you went straight into trying to discredit me for “for having an agenda”
That’s as bad as the fake news cry. If you want to discuss this then let’s discuss it but you haven’t added anything
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:58:46
The fact that you think crypto is here to make money shows exactly how flawed you are here. It has and always will be a tool to buy things. That’s what blockchain is, and that’s why bitcoin will fail. If you think it’s to make money then you are admitting to buying into a pyramid scheme hoping that other people will buy and increase the price just so you can dump and get rich

You mean the long and dead AOL?


The network that isn’t even released yet?
Lol this one is good, a virus that has sense nearly disappeared? That also has nothing to do with the market what so ever?


A literally eradicated disease?
BTC is trying to be a currency and isn’t even the best at what it does. It was the first of its kind but so was American Video, Blockbuster, VHS, floppy disks, etc.. If BTC somehow figures out how to maintain a market value without speculators then we’re talking, but it was speculators that drove it up to $19,000, speculators bailing out that brought it down, and it would be speculators that would bring it back up. But they’re burned and gone and they’ve moved on.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:31:09
Fair point lmao
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:12:24
And how is that different to every other block chain based coin that don’t have ridiculous wait times and fees along with actual privacy?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:22:42
Which coins rose 700% in the past 3 months? Like I said, I did the math on most of the tops coins and they rose 200-300%
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:07:54
That is absolutely false. The demand for
Bitcoin was from speculators who thought they could get rich quick from it. That is dying off and now the coins that offer what bitcoin tried to offer are growing. Bitcoin has the slowest transaction fees and times, is not anonymous, and can only be used as a coin, unlike other platforms.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:24:07
My response to the other guy (I posted them in the wrong order):
Let me ask, what do you think bitcoin offers that consumers would rather have over other coins? It’s not faster, it’s not less expensive to use, it’s not anonymous, and the technology backing it is already being outpaced by others. The literally most basic equation in economics is marginal benefits &gt; marginal cost. I’d recon that there’s not many people out there eager to jump back on a speculative market where they stand to lose so much with diminishing returns after a “correction” (bubble pop here) like this one. If bitcoin loses the public fame it will die, we are seeing both. Now let me also ask you, what does bitcoin have on its horizon that would reverse what we’re seeing? Because it doesn’t control its own market value, the consumer does. Unless there’s something absolutely massive, you will not see it gain over $10,000 ever again.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:18:04
So we’ll call it 2020 then
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:36:28
No they aren’t, the market is definitely bullish even still but most of these coins only jumped 200-300%, which I’d still attribute to a bubble but 700% is absolutely unheard of.
Happy cake day btw
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:59:54
Is bubbling 700% in 3 months a “natural” way of things too?
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:00:33
That’s called a bubble, not a correction lol
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:26
We have been talking about the last 3 months specifically this entire conversation. All of them came up like that because they were selling for fractions of pennies before last year.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:58:28
My guy you are in the middle of a psychotic episode if you think it’ll return to 19,000
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:12:14
Interesting, what else has ever done that before?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:50:27
No, because there is a difference between an emerging market and a speculative market. I suggest you read up on both of those some to put what’s going on into context.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:11:32
Ethereum and lightcoin are close. That’s the first mover advantage and has never and will never keep a product or service at the forefront. Blackberry made the first advanced phones and they’re long dead

Lmaooooo you actually have no clue what you’re talking about do you? There are plenty of other block chains that are just as decentralized. You are obviously one of the speculators I was talking about. Good luck getting your money back
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:40:53
Cake day is your reddit birthday
And maybe if you look at the scam and shady coins but even Eth, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and the likes only jumped about 200%. I literally just went through and did the math for the last 3 months
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:42:13
Calling people a troll doesn’t make your problems go away
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:07:28
Crypto’s purpose is to be decentralized, and anonymous so that things like the bank runs in the Great Depression can’t happen again. You are willingly buying into the crashing of a pyramid scheme in the hopes that you’ll make money and you are going to be hurting in your wallet here in a couple months lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:08:45
I can’t because I’d be charged a $40 transaction fee
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:52:54
But since when has a wallet been considered a bank account? If this is how they’ll handle it then we will have to declare our actual wallets and piggy banks of our kids. A wallet for pretty much every crypto is designed to be NOT a bank 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:50:03
This is how we fight it then. I’ll declare my fuckin renown on siege and see how much that does for them 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:12:10
My guy, markets aren’t a science, and stocks and currencies have failed and fixed before.
