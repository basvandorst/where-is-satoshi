.2 percent on that yeah, but not .2% of I️ bought a $0.75 candy bar. More like 150%

In case anyone with a Trezor doesn’t know... you can now claim your bitcoin gold. No one told me and so I thought I’d spread the news

Look here guy yes it is a retarded question. It doesn’t matter if the node size was 1,000,000,000 or 1, it still is working better than bitcoin.

I’ve gotten to the same point. I️ deleted my portfolio app, deleted Coinbase, and put an autocorrection on my phone when I️ type in “coinmarketcap” to correct to “STOP, IDIOT.” It’s just needless temporary stress that will be gone soon enough

That was the most poorly crafted and terribly worded comment ever...
But if I️ can look past the numerous errors it’s just so wrong. 
When have you paid $5? I️ doubt that has happened and I️ bet $1,000,000 that you cannot provide proof. 
(Note: I️ have been with bitcoin for about a year and a half, not the longest time, sure, but enough.  I️ still hold a lot of my bitcoin, but my confidence in it is wavering.) 
LN is just one step of many bitcoin needs to achieve before it can be a competition to some of the better coins out there. First, segwit adoption must be complete (who knows when that will happen) and then LN can be activated, again, god only knows how far out we are from that. Even when those two things are complete it is still not enough. You are a typical thick headed, bull mentality, moron that is responsible for a lot of bitcoins problems. Educate yourself.

How is this what happened? Literally bitcoin is up the least amount on the top 20 on coinmarketcap 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:06:01
This is a retarded question. Who cares? I️t is still more usable than bitcoin at this moment

Hey I’ve been with bitcoin almost two years. I️ love it and I️ wish it would take over all cryptos, but the fact is, it is not useable and there isn’t a fix in the near or semi distant future. Other cryptos are faster, free, and more anonymous. Bitcoins market domination has rapidly decreased while others like litecoin and ethereum have rapidly increased. 
Stop being a beehive mind bitcoin supremacist who is too thick headed to see that bitcoin needs help. 
Use some common sense.

Exactly. Nice analogy. I’m really worried for btc but most of the atmosphere around here is memes and hodl jokes so few people seem to actually know how bad this is and no one is taking it seriously

Ahhh a hater&lt;3 someone’s mad they didn’t make the front page HUH? Get pissed

Wow yeah let’s stop using them because they are having trouble/slow speeds as a result of hundreds of thousands of new users. Nice post

You have health goin up as btc goes down. Not accurate
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:56:35
Let me make it easier for you to understand:
Bitcoin is SLOW and EXPENSIVE.
Ethereum and some others are FAST and CHEAP. 
This means that bitcoin is becoming OUTDATED and uses ARCHAIC technology (simplified for your slow mind, just think about archaic meaning old).
Bitcoin needs to CHANGE if it wants to stay 
Anyone with a brain can understand that.

I’m on the Same page with banks. No argument there. 
The worry is other cryptos. I️ just sent $890 from my Trezor to coinbase and paid $16 and had to wait 13 hours. Why would anyone do that when ETH, ADA, LTC, etc are all fat cheaper if not free and much MUCH quicker, if not instant? That’s the thing is BTC is getting left in the dust. More and more cryptos are passing the hundred or thousand dollar mark and eventually if BTC does nothing it’s going to lose.

Yeah but they didn’t start the first paper money ever as huge 2’x3’ pieces of paper. And if they did start as that, it sure as hell wouldn’t take them a year or more to make the money smaller. It’s ridiculous.
