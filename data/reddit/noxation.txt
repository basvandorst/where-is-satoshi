Yeah, I'm more than likely going to just buy off coinbase. I'm seeing local traders asking 100$+ overpay.

Looked into it, It seems that people are getting 3$ fee's for sending any amount of money.
Seems a bit of a high fee, but I understand.
I'm going to spend a few hours looking into more of this.

I heard that if it's 10 minutes or half an hour, there's no longer an option to Chargeback Bitcoin.
This stuff is a bit confusing regarding all the fees and stuff, I really wish Paypal just updated their damn chargeback regulations I suppose.

Ah okay.
Where should I buy Bitcoin? I just got the Mycelium and I'm a bit confused on what my address is to get this information ha-ha.

I would buy off a friend, if there's no sites that are like a 1:1 basis.
I have a decent reputation in the CSGO community to which I've used to make connections just incase something like this were to come along.
I just need to know a good wallet to get to be quite honest, ha-ha.

Ah, alright.
Thanks a ton for the help.
I might go with Mycelium, but I see a few of them on the Google Play store, so I'm unsure on what's the real one, ha-ha.

Just a quick question.
All of these are connected right? If I use mycelium and someone uses Bitcoin classic or some other wallet, I can still send them money?
Or are all fee's different for sending / receiving from all the different types of wallets?

How long does it take for someone to chargeback? Do I sit with them until that time limit is up/

The most I'd like to keep in a BTC wallet would be 10,000$ (USD Value)
Nothing more than that.
I've read a lot on BTC, and it just seems a bit confusing to be perfectly honest.
I've been told many times to use Bitcoin classic, and some other stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:05:32
Yeah, I was looking.
They're only taking CC/Debit.
I don't feel like waiting 2-3 days to withdraw from Paypal.
I guess I'll have to find another way later.
