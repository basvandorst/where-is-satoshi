Yes you have the most privacy with cash. However, if you're doing something illegal enough you won't even have privacy with cash (bill tracking via the ID  on the bills). But just normal crypto enthusiasts who are concerned about privacy and anonymity, it's fine.

Buy with cash, only way to buy coins imo

I personally agree but that is a very progressive view and the court system is not about being progressive, they simply uphold our current laws. I guess his only hope is for a future president who sympathizes with him.

Thought I might get some interesting answers. Legit can't tell if this sub is all bots or real humans.

If you told someone 20 years ago about "Informed Delivery", they'd say you were insane.

I am seriously so impressed he's succeeded in staying anonymous. He must have zero desire for recognition.
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:23:47
You're right. I think it does pretty well in one use case and that's as an off-the-radar transfer of funds across distance.

$4k? You need a new goal man.

You fundamentally don't understand the purpose of bitcoin if you think it needs banks and governments to stabilize it.

Mass mail inspection is definitely possible. Not likely with our current tech.

I agree...4000 is a ton of money.  I don't make a lot of money or anything..but look at his username it's his LIFE goal..life...$4k in a lifetime is nothing. I didn't consider that he could live in some developing country.

It was originally intended as a currency. People like you think it's a stock and try to make money off of it, and then get upset when it doesn't increase in price. You'd be better off buying stocks in a company.

As a buyer you do not have to load fiat onto the site. You can use localbitcoins merely as a place to arrange a trade with a seller. Fiat never has to be held by the site if you use it correctly. 
Localbitcoins shouldn't be thrown is as being the same as coinbase, binance, etc.

Everyone realised it was a fad and won't happen again. But then there's some other delusional wierdos who are all hoping for some free money...and they all hang out in this subreddit posting memes!

I would want him pardoned too. Double life sentence is far too harsh. However, he would never be let out simply because the scale of his operation was so far above what other "typical" drug traffickers /dealers do. It's likely Ross was (indirectly) responsible for countless OD deaths from drugs purchased on SR.

I see, that makes sense. They were definitely making a statement since it was the first of its kind. They can't keep up at this point, though. The only way the markets in their current form would go away at this point is if 1) Tor is made illegal (is in some countries already, but I mean my country - the US) 2) Buying cryptocurrencies is made illegal 3) The internet as we know it changes (thinking like if internet was to turn into cable-type packaging of certain apps/ websites only). This would prevent access to Tor, so  kinda goes with  4) Mass mail inspection becomes a new norm.

The compensation would be increased privacy. Also, with the right equipment you could solo mine.

It doesn't. People who are new to BTC think centralized exchanges are the only way to buy bitcoin.
