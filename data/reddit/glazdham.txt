Didn't truecrypt just complete a security audit which revealed no backdoors?
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:29:37
it is from Half-Life 2

It was supposed to be 11:59 last Fri. ACH and nothing. I called my bank to see if pending or queued and NADA.

I have quit using them however, they are holding around a thousand bucks of my cash and will not release it. I think posting here serves 2 purposes (perhaps more). To inform the community that they have not sorted out their issues and to perhaps get their attention in getting a problem that multiple people are having resolved. No need to be a fucking dick about it.

this is my first major issue with them. I hate that it's gone sideways. I knew their fees were high but otherwise they had been pretty slick.

I enjoy trading there but it is slower than a lot of places...never any issue with them. Currently Coinbase is holding over $1,000 worth of BTC of mine and refuses to answer my many support requests.

I just got my deposit but yes I lost hundreds in the process.

Ha! Derp on me I didn't look at your username. Thanks.

I have seen a lot of coinbase cheerleading on here but no offers to solve any issues. I am not saying they are the devil. I have had numerous positive experiences with them. what I was pointing out is that when there's a problem they seem understaffed to the point of no response to a ticket for over 80 hours. none, other than an auto-responder. I freaked out because their mistake has cost me much in the way of lost opportunity. I don't know what happened because I have never been told. As a consumer, I appreciate how much they nailed bank-level security and wish support was at the same service quality level. I am calmer now and maybe it will get fixed tomorrow. I won't keep beating a dead horse.

coinbase...especially after verification. agreed.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:03:13
Still No money and no response from Coinbase. it is now 11AM 3 days after my withdrawal should have cleared. Still radio silence from Coinbase. I know they use reddit. What the Hell? People rely on timely withdrawals and This is going to cause me lots of trouble if not resolved today. :(
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:14:50
how long does it take any of you to get money out of coinbase...I am currently overdue $802 by 3 days
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:52:38
I cannot discourage the use of coinbase harder. no customer service at all. no phone # and no responses to many emails. I sold $800 woth  of BTC and it is just gone. FUCK COINBASE! I sent that money to myself to pay bills and now I am screwed. they are 3 days out beyond when the cash was to be ACH transferred to my account. try bitstamp or campbx or just local bitcoins. I can't believe businesses use a service with such terrible customer service.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:47:03
campbx and bitstamp I use wire xfer in...not instant but about the same price without all of the week wait (if you are new) to coinbase. I am not new to coinbase but feel shafted by them. and not by some of the alternatives I mentioned. They may straighten my shit out. who knows, they can't be bothered to answer any inquiries.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:41:11
I will keep reposting until they straighten my shit out
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:40:08
How can a company serve 10,000 businesses and have such dogshit support. I hate to use Reddit as my mouthpiece but if it saves some others some hassle, so be it. I will go back to the service I was using before. I was lured by the "instant buy" which does work but ACH to bank is broken
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:18:44
I had the same problem and it is fixed as of this morning. I sent about 6 messages to their support and 2 on here. No response at any point from their team on here, bitcointalk or email. I think based on what was posted here and bitcointalk that the had a small fire to put out regarding ACH but refused to admit it until it was on both sites and people were taking up a fight to get their funds released. I would guess  that many lost money while they made thousands. I also sent another single bitcoin to the site last night to test the water one last time and noted they have doubled the time to process a sell ACT xfer to bank. I think this is good until their growing pains are sorted out. Instead of hating on the people who speak out in the community when a company is having issues, people should look at the company to handle their issues while keeping a level of transparency that doesn't stir community panic for fears of being robbed. Bitcoin is still a little like the wild west and in the back of our minds, many companies could secretly operate unethically. - sorry for the long post
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:18:42
does this mean that ACH withdraws dated for last week should go through tonight?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:04:09
do you work for coinbase?
