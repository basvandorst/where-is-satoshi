That shit is unforgivable in my opinion

They do not require wires. They have a 500 dollar limit a day (30000 monthly) when it is linked to your bank. Fees seemed really cheap too. Don't hold me to this - but if I recall Gemini was like 5.xx verses Coinbases 3x.xx for the same amount of money. 
The wire fee is 20 dollars from my bank, but the instant transaction really makes up for it at certain times.

Unfortunately - it is not. I'll play with anything except obligations. If you tell me 3-5 days I'll have my money and it takes 8-11.. no thanks.

I think you are joking

I only read the “new free bitcoins”

Head on over to r/btc if you want to be so helpful. 
You aren’t helping or answering the question asked. Obviously I’m not going to day trade like that with accompanying fees as such. 
You could provide where you trade and what fees are if you want to provide insight.

I HODL because I believe Bitcoin can free us. The fiat system being centrally controlled, inflation, manipulation, and big banks have “enslaved” the modern people. Bitcoin let’s us take some of that power back. It’s empowering, a movement, a revolution, the new way, and I want to support that. 
I believe it is time for a chance, and this can be the way. We can take power back, and the people should have the power. Not the government with trillion debts, greedy bankers, the rich and elite, lobbying Congress/Senate people with corrupt bribes for corporations/secret agendas funded by the control over my/taxpayers money.
I don’t want to support anything but the freedom of the human race, to fight the 40 hour work week. Bitcoin is the way, the new tech, and HODL’ing is me supporting that cause and dream.

Why would a transaction get stuck? 
Things like that are the one reason I feel “safe” on an online exchange wallet and sending service...

That is what I meant! If I wouldn’t have had food in one hand and my phone in the other I might have taken more time to write that. 
That is what I was looking for though. The features that “sold” you onto whatever product/service...

Where can I find someone who would pay $5000 to write a bad review on a company? Please, asking for a friend!!
But no.. I loved Coinbase. Without it I don’t know if I would have been able to get into Bitcoin when and how I did..

Asking if it cheaper - I’ve seen all the hype about “low fees” just asking if 25 dollars is the norm for buying a bitcoin.
If you day trade and make 100 trades a day - fees would be 5,000 dollars at selling and buying 1 bitcoin 100 times a day at that rate with the current exchange I use. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:15:23
How do I know what the fee should be to ensure it doesn’t get stuck? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:20:38
That’s what I was thinking.. I need USD/BTC primarily...

I took a loss when Coinbase closed my account due to what they felt was suspicious activity - with no chance to justify myself - and lost $2200. 
- but since! I’ve been looking at Gdax, but it syncs up to your Coinbase and Coinbase won’t let me use their services anymore.. I’d love to try Gdax.

Can you fund straight from your bank USD to binance? For some reason I thought it was a BTC to other coin exchange... 
Can I send wires and what kind of limits do they have? Thanks
