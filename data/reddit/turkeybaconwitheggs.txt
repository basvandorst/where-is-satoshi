Algorithms to measure watch times and frequency, skips, drop offs etc, compared to historical trends of video ratings vs data collected. Easy.

No you won’t, nobody will hire you because whatever you can do, machines can do better and/or cheaper. Give me an example of a job you can do and I can give you at least three ways a machine can do it better.

When machines take over your job eventually you’ll be wishing UBI was implemented. We’ll all be jobless soon.

Not right now I don’t think but it won’t be a big step up from news articles so it should be coming soon enough.
Incidentally a quick google search:

If you earn $2000 a month now, and I’m jobless, you have an infinite amount of money more than me.
However, if you take $3000 a month next, and I have $1000 a month, you only have three times more than me. 
UBI is more complex than that because of spending habits but it will close the inequality gap.

I just gave you one, the clip will be rated and you admit nobody’s going to watch your low production shitty step sister videos so the rating was not necessary in the first place.

That’s a 15k annual salary, pretty pathetic if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:54:25
The impacts and complicity of UBI extend far beyond what we can imagine at the moment, considering the rates of population growth, unemployment as well as automation.

No you won’t be fine, you’ll be the one kissing ass to make ends meet, and yet, a machine will also do that better than you, so tough luck.

Bought bitcoin and only bitcoin because I believe it is the purest form of value exchange. 
It is the only form of money that is controlled by no-one, yet influenced by everyone. 
It is the money no government, organization or individual can hope to control or manipulate, and in such times as ours we’ve come to see how important that is. It is money free from human agenda.

The price of bitcoin may fall to $1000, fine. The price of bitcoin may surge to $100k, that’s fine too.
Bitcoin is not a get rich scheme for me. I accept bitcoin at my own small business because I’m sick and tired of dealing with banks and credit card companies. I’m sick of having to pay ridiculous fees every time I want to send some money home.
I believe in bitcoin because I believe in my own financial freedom from institutions, from governments. That’s why I don’t hodl but spend and accumulate. 
Only when we do our part in spreading the gospel of bitcoin will bitcoin be strong. Spending our time Reddit posting memes and speculating about price will not make bitcoin strong. 
Please go out there and start using bitcoin, talking bitcoin and believing in bitcoin.

I accept bitcoin more than I spend, but yes, today my product is worth 0.25btc, tomorrow my product is still worth 0.25btc.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:03:08
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:27:52
What price? 0.25btc is 0.25btc.
Think of it the other way, today 1btc = $7.8k. You go out and spend $7.8k, then tomorrow 1btc = $3.9k drops by half, effectively yesterday you spent 2btc instead of 1btc. Not very wise spending USD eh?
So your consideration of price fluctuations go both ways. If you need to spend money, you spend money whether it’s USD or BTC.

Seriously guys, for your own sakes, please keep your bitcoin balance to yourselves.

Because when 1btc = more value than you can imagine, you will need the anonymity. If a hacker can get to MtGox and Binance, how easy a target are you?
