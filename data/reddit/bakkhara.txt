Thanks. I didnt know the client reindexes the whole chain. I thought its just the last couple GB. Good to know.

Just keep in mind that a running a full node requires you to have an unlimited data plan from your ISP (or rate limit the node), [otherwise you'll blow through your bandwidth](
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:42:24
Replying to my own post feels weird... still I forgot to mention something and didnt wanna edit again. 
Consider installing "vnstat" to monitor your bandwidth and make sure you got a unlimited data plan from your ISP since you'll be sending out those Gigabytes like cookies ;)    
    pi $ vnstat

Running a full node myself I can only recommend everyone to either limit data or having a unlimited data plan like me :P
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:55
I sure hope thats sarcasm.    
I am not trying to spread any FUD or anything.    
I thought a discussion on the mempool would be something different than the constant price memes on this sub
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:32
So just because I discuss in various subreddits different coins/projects I cant bring up a discussion which doesnt focus around the price? Sure I guess I'm an alt-coiner then on this sub...
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:22:23
Nice that you have put your pi to work. Running a pi node myself here some suggestions    
I use ufw as a firewall on my pi    
    
    pi $ sudo ufw status verbose

    Logging: on (low)
    Default: deny (incoming), deny (outgoing), disabled (routed)

Consider adding this to your /boot/config.txt     
    # More power for the USB port
    max_usb_current=1
    # Set GPU Memory
    gpu_mem=16
I have disabled WiFi and Bluetooth on my pi since I dont need it    
    systemctl disable wpa_supplicant
    systemctl disable bluetooth
    systemctl disable hciuart
And in /boot/config.txt add    
    # Disable WiFi and Bluetooth
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
Finally I've tweaked/added some stuff to my bitcoin.conf    
    # Set database cache size in megabytes (4 to 16384, default: 300)
    dbcache=100
    # Keep the transaction memory pool below &lt;n&gt; megabytes (default: 300)
    maxmempool=50
    # Keep at most &lt;n&gt; unconnectable transactions in memory (default: 100)
    maxorphantx=10
    # There's I believe 50KB per block that can be used for transactions paying no fees at all.
    # I'm blocking all zero fee transactions. If they don't bother to pay, I won't be bothered expending resources on them.
    limitfreerelay=0
Sorry for the long post &amp; thank you for running a node
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:18:28
Yeah I'm running mine on a RPI3 (500GB USB SSD)    
I wouldnt trust any torrent or 3rd party download of the blockchain.    
What you could do though is let bitcoin core sync to 100% on your pc and then transfer the blockchain to your pi.    
At least thats how I did it ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:45:16
Would you mind explaining "limitfreerelay"?    
And the default for "minrelaytxfee" afaik is 1,000 satoshi per kB ?    
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:09:16
a month ago r/btc was full of segwit2x . seems like they all changed their mind and praise bcash now
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:50:37
Thanks for explaining.    
In my bitcoin.conf on my pi I also set
    dbcache=100
    maxmempool=50
    maxorphantx=10
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:23:05
Its amazing how many scammers are writing below that tweet
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:40:03
To be fully honest I have no idea about legal consequences. Maybe someone else can help answer that?
I can imagine buying crypto wouldn't be that big of a deal but selling on the other hand...I dont know
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:32:41
In general I would say yes.
It depends on your VPS though. Let me try to explain on the example of netflix:
netflix doesnt want people to use a VPN for theire service so they went ahead and blacklisted all major VPN resellers IP ranges. Its still possible to use a VPN though if you find a company they didnt blacklist yet.
So regarding your question: I dont think bittrex blacklists VPNs yet so you should be good. Hope that helps
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:15:35
Why are people still surprised about stuff like this?
There is SO much money to make in this whole sektor ofc everyone who has the chance abuses it somehow.    
Newsflash: It's not only bitcoin/crypto where stuff like this happens
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:05:02
Would you mind explaining the 2FA in python part or direct me to a resource where I can read something about that? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:05:18
Runnig a full node myself I thought I'd share my ufw config as well    
    pi $ sudo ufw status verbose
    Status: active
    Logging: on (low)
    Default: deny (incoming), deny (outgoing), disabled (routed)
    New profiles: skip

    53 (v6)                    ALLOW OUT   Anywhere (v6)              # dns    
also I have added "dbcache=100", "maxmempool=50" &amp; "maxorphantx=10" to my bitcoin.config    
and "max_usb_current=1" &amp; "gpu_mem=16" to my /boot/config.txt of the pi    
Edit: I have disabled WiFi and Bluetooth as well because I dont need them.    
    systemctl disable wpa_supplicant
    systemctl disable bluetooth
    systemctl disable hciuart
    
And add to /boot/config.txt    
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi
    dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
