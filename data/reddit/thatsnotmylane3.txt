thx for the quick reply!! can somebody else vouch for this? i thought btc companies they dun like credit card bc credit cards can charge back.

oh so u put in like Canadian dollar in exchange for Bitcoins. Cant i just do that online using paypal or credit card or debit bank account. why bother using these ATMs

So ive heard quickbt and also Quardriga. which one is better. I tried to buy bitcoin using 100 CAD, it was charging 6.50$ for the transaction fee? is this correct? seems so steep lol. I have also set up a mycelium wallet, with the PIN # and the word sequence is this enough security?

Hi all, I am interested in buying bitcoin. I have been reading around but all these wallets and vaults and phrases and all these different companies in different regions, and something about ATMS and going in person? I am not even sure there are such thing in Canada. Any Canadian bitcoiners here can tell me what I can do to get started?
thanks in advance.

what is a bit coin ATM? and i live in Toronto. why is there small amounts vs big amounts? what isa  flexepin voucher? why are there difffernet user data bases for different dot com sites, arnt all bit coins the same value. This makes me question safety because there seems to be a lack of continuity and standardization
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:01:37
quickbt is good? can someone vouche for this? I am really scared. 1 bit coin is like $1000. this is quite an investment!!
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:28:57
so it looks like i cannot use QUICKBT, because my bank is PC financial. And its not supported to interact transfer bitcoins
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:08:45
quickBT isnt mentioned in this guide:  that is why i find it so much ambiguity, nobody can seem to agree on any kind of standardization. I dont want to have my thing happen to what happened to satoshivault.

man you are so smart!! lol NOT. you think you are the first person to come up with this argument? this argument is a tier 1 argument every bitcoiner asks himself in the 1st phase of contemplating to buy bitcoins. I saw numerous threads liek this back when Bitcoin was worth 600 usd .... now 5000 USD later, 1. people have become millionairs out of bitcoins. 2. numerous new discovery and applications in tech and encryption has spun out of crytocurrencies. 3. governments have trial, passed, banned, circumvented laws to try to break and support bitcoin and other cryptos. yet .. bitcoin is still rallying stronger than ever as it becomes main stream. So does any of the shit you say matter? NO IT DOES NOT, it had not, it never did and will it ever? sure ... but not before I've made my money and left the stage. sit down you dotard.  You can keep hesitating your weak hand, while the majority of us take the gamble and buy in while we can; id appreciate that you buy in later than now.
