I have been using Glidera (integrated with mycelium wallet on Android), seems secure, and it's only 1% fees and easy to use.

2- Could he receive his mining pool payments to the trezor / ledger hardware?  I'm assuming he can since you can always receive money to a wallet with bitcoin right?
Thank you for  I will definitely consider getting a hardware wallet now myself.

Freedom of religion was put in the first amendment to protect us from thought like this.  Let people believe what they want and raise their children with what values they want.

Just gotta say.. the level of elite-ism on this thread is maddening.  I know little about bitcoin but am very interested in it, and the people acting like this is an acceptable situation or that the OP should have known exactly how to avoid the situation are ridiculous.  If I bought some bitcoin, and I wanted to buy a pizza with it, I would expect it to work the first time, instantly, without issue.  If it didn't and I got this reaction from ya'll when I complained, I would say "screw bitcoin" and sell it asap.  You guys who are being jerks need to have a reality check if you want this to succeed in the general population.

Just because you don't like or appreciate organized religion and religious institutions doesn't mean that they are all gathering donations or compelling you for their own benefit.  Usually churches do a massive amount of charity and mission work with that money.  And I think all of us could be humbled by the message put forth in the bible.  We are (on the whole) awful and greedy beings who are not deserving of gods mercy.  If you're like me you want to follow in the footsteps and examples in the Bible of the most perfect and gentle man to ever walk this earth (Jesus Christ).
Not trying to debate religion here, just trying to insert a Christian voice.  =)
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:18:42
that's quite the distortion...  Sorry if you've had a bad experience with someone / some organization, or choose to accept every negative stereotype as fact, but this is just an awful representation.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:32:05
To equate raising your children to be Christians and raising them to be racist is ludicrous, many of the most loving, kind, and compassionate people I know are Christians.  Christ tells us to love everyone.

It looks like it accepts 7 6-pin power connections is that correct?  Two hashing boards with 3 each and another 6-pin connector for the main board?  My question is this...
I have a bunch of 1000W 120v kits from S7's  (such as:    Could I use these to power the R4?

like coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:19:12
What wallet are you using?  It's probably not payment protocol compliant.

What does their poor performance have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:07
We need to pass 2x for the time being until we can get better solutions implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:06:35
but they can spam all they want if the block rewards get lowered along with the difficulty modifier, right?  They wouldn't actually be gaining anything from it if that was the case.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:01:47
Not talking about changing size of blocks.  Only allowing them to be discovered more quickly but with less rewards going to miners.  Theoretically the miners would be getting the same amount and the chances of any one miner finding 1BTC should be the same if it was scaled proportionally.  No centralization should occur because of these factors.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:35:30
you've convinced me with your eloquent words, buying even more to hold lol  Very well said
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:36
Don't you think that it's plenty possible it's just a matter of people seeing the hype and buying it to make some money from it instead of truly hoping to get use from it?  I fear this is setting up a scenario similar but much worse than 2013 where there will be a giant sell-off since the real value of Bitcoin as a currency won't be developed enough and it's only value is based on it's value... I could see this collapse destroying the image of crypto-currency completely in the eyes of most.
Instead of chasing gains and encouraging HODLING non-stop we should be encouraging it's usefulness.  I just think much more needs to be done to advance it's usefulness as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:47:52
Because (assuming from your snide remarks) people like you who only care about profiteering on the investment, don't give a crap about the world changing potential of bitcoin and are ruining it by making it only your financial play-thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:03:47
I hope your right.  I just hope we solve the problems and greatly expand it's usefulness as a currency before any big collapse.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:45:53
That's pretty good reasoning honestly.  Still don't think a 10x increase is justified by anything other than people wanting to buy it to hold it as an investment.

You don't understand how tax brackets work friend.  You're only taxed that percentage on the income that falls in those brackets.  Also, those are not the final brackets in the law.  They kept seven brackets etc..
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:46:46
That will make the price go up, but that does not bode well for it's long term usability.  If all you care about is a quick buck (or a few years good run) on an investment, sure but I am hoping bitcoin can be more than that...
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:24:36
use a different wallet, I use mycelium on my android phone, it's great.  The price is whatever people are willing to pay for it...  So countless factors influence it.

But aren't all the transactions in mempool going to get written to the blockchain regardless of how fast they are added??  I don't see why it would matter beyond the fact that more people would be using it as an every day currency and it would once again be useful for micro-transactions..  Which is kinda our ultimate aim I would think.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:30:46
So this honestly feels "right" to you?  A currency that has little use as a currency has gained over 10x it's value in a single year?  And talk about it as an investment and not a currency is blowing up like mad.  Seems to me, responses like yours want to ignore these things.  Do you still use Bitcoin as a currency?  Is it actually still useful for you or has it just become an investment tool?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:44:12
I added $100 to my Steam wallet a couple weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:41:34
get an account at a place like coinbase, buy some bitcoin, then transfer it to a wallet like mycelium or something similar since it's not a good idea to let coinbase or any other exchange hold your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:59:09
You'd have to change the block reward, otherwise with the increased numbers of blocks being found you'd mine all 21Million bitcoins much quicker than anticipated.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:11:01
I don't think it's all that impossible either.  There are lots of chip foundries all over the world, surely you can find one that can do this.  
BUT as contractmine said, it's just not profitable for the small fries anymore, so the market isn't there for them.  The market is there for the big guys which is why bitmain only makes expensive miners and not cheaper ones most likely.  So by making more miners available at more reasonable price, you would actually just be making mining less affordable for the little guys in the long run I think.
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:02:57
Very cool!!!  love it
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:32:53
buying bitcoin outright would then still be the more profitable way to do it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:03:16
I think you might be getting confused when people are asking for bigger blocks (I was too at first).  No one is asking for bigger block rewards for miners, people want bigger block sizes so more transactions could be processed at one time.  The debate has basically nothing to do with mining.
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:31:59
1% fee when buying over $20 I think.  I like Glidera, have used them a few times.
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:50:25
Litecoin a scam?  How so?
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:05:39
Just because it might not have a real solid use-case doesn't mean anyone's trying to "scam" people with it.  That being said, I can't see why anyone would be using it or holding it either currently.
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:26:37
you can buy an amazon gift card on gyft.com 1:1 Though your reddit history looks solid enough, I'll give you $40 in BTC if you're interested?

Glidera for mycelium wallet works great.

mycelium wallet integrates Glidera and it has been good for me.  1% exchange fee

buy from someone locally

Mycelium wallet with Glidera built-in exchange works great for me

Buy from someone locally, localbitcoins or a bitcoin ATM, or ask a friend to buy some of theirs etc..

should be able to, but obviously you might need to use VPN to redeem the gift card on amazon also.
