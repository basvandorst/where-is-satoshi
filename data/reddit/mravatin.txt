What core did you use to make it?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:29:37
Is this with coinbase too?
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:11:35
Wtf that house is cheap af for that price.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:21:48
Yeah screw usd. I found a new coin that my people use. I think it was called ughh.....CAD. YUP best currency in the world. But 1 for .75. It's cheap, water proof and if ur rich it even smells like maple. So don't fall for these paper money and come buy plastic.

Fine you know what I'll sell. Who wants to buy bitcoin for $40k each?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:38:07
Yes, I know about gdax. I haven't set up any varification, so I didn't want to go through the trouble as I put money into coinbase by accident :/
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:28:13
Ah, sorry I ment the core program used to code.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:32:57
Why do you need 5 monitors to monitor 1 graph?
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:31:22
Not forcing the air to heat, duh.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:02:24
The more mainstream the more stable.

In india from what I've heard its illegal now :(
Government complained that can't collect tax from it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:08:52
Maybe it's cause cause we are still 11 months away?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:38
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:15:01
Rule of thumb if a website has a pop up which says "NAME just got $100" or "NAME just bought an ant miner s9" chances are it's a scam.

Well if you want something to last then the Nokia for sure but if you want short term then the smartphone. No matter how hard the Nokia goes down it will still be undamaged. While it only takes a small drop for the smartphones to crash.

my meme is not showing up
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:29:50
Wow this sub is so rich now, so much gold!
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:30:23
I HODL cause I only spent as much as I can afford to loose ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:50:24
Yeah, exactly. I'd you were to just buy the car then you would still loose 8000 in return for a car. Then thing in now person 2 now have 8000 worth of btc to spend. He spend He buys and the more and more people do this the more btc will be stored and demand would also go up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:28:45
I'm saving it for a special occasion, sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:02:08
How about we call it a cube.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:59:33
True. Spend it use it rather than HODL. Out of BTC? But more or sell your stuff for btc. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:34:35
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:08:28
hey dont forget to buy it at 8k too. I still have hope
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:42:59
I am an expert i see its price the same as the distance from earth to moon.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:42:11
I'm only spending 30cents per day on electricity and getting 0.0003-0.0005 btc a day.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:32:45
None. If it drops below 10% I will eat a full bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:15:26
Paging u/spez can you confirm
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:51:28
Buy btc from person 3.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:40
Hey man does that mean the currency wont exist after march :(
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:53:01
I remember seeing this when people were saying it will dip during the 19-20k period :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:27:46
Canadian plastic money. 8000 cad 6443usd.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:44:42
And it's down. I think if you repost it goes down,maybe the key is to post fresh and new memes that way it'll keep climbing. My comment alone would bring the price up by $1. Your welcome 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:58:07
Oh sorry should have mentioned that in nicehash we sell hashing power and get paid in btc. E.g. we mine equihash and get paid in btc
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:28:07
Is that a bet?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:10:36
