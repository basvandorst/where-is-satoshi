One thing that should be mentioned to the user is the fact that they need to wait until they have downloaded all the current blocks. I think they mention it in the "Getting Started" part of the site, but I was quite confused of why the program doesn't tell you.  Those who go straight to the download button could get quite confused by this.

It is believed that whoever controls majority of the computational power will only be capable of changing the order of old transactions, and this gets harder he farther back you go. Since this isn't as profitable as just "following the rules" it is likely that no one will attempt it. Deepbit (a mining pool, if you don't know) has at least twice (to my knowledge) come close to havin majority, but that's simply because of it's popularity.

As Bitcoins mentions in their wiki (somewhere), anyone who trys to buy all the bitcoins will eventually bankrupt themselves, because the value of the coin would go up as they buy it. I think the wiki uses the analogy: " what if someone tried to buy all the gold in the world?".

Nothing. Mostly just saving up, and I'll probably convert it to USD anyways.
