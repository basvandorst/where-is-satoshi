If there’s a 5-7k drop that means it’ll still be valued at over 10k. Nobody will say something valued 10k a piece is dead.

2 years is just silly. Our generation are the first adopters of this and we are still limited as to how much we can use it for. Baby boomers certainly aren’t going to be huge adopters and I doubt enough gen x-Ers will use it. I don’t think crypto will ever replace fiat as is, but if it does it won’t be for a long time.

The difference is when you start a business there are things in your control. This guy essentially gambled on something he had no control over. That being said, if he had the kind of equity and ability to obtain a 300k+ mortgage he’s probably already making good money and able to make the payments (I’d hope)

No bubble, no bubble, you’re the bubble!

I uh.... I don’t think anyone’s motivated to go buy after that

I didn’t say control leads to success, obviously businesses fail but there’s organization, planning, goals etc that go into starting a business. There’s control over operations, the ability to make decisions that effect your business. None of that applies to a bitcoin investment. You have zero influence over bitcoin... it could all go away tomorrow and there’s nothing you could have done to stop it.
No, I don’t own my own business, I’m an auditor in public accounting so I see how businesses are run. If one of my clients has a bad year or is losing money they do something about it, they don’t just go “it’s ok I’m just gonna HODL”

Google? You don’t need a referral to see a CPA

Not unless you already make whatever the 39% threshold is... 415k or something for single filers. Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income... like how your wages from work are taxed
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:01:57
Yes that’s what I was saying. Short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income and taxed as such. Moreover, no offense to op, I doubt he’s withdrawing enough to break into that high bracket.
The overall point that I was trying to make though was that it’s not an automatic 39%. it’s 39% of any income over ~415,000. So if you made $415,001, only $1 gets taxed at 39%.

What do you mean zero control? so people take out a loan, pay the fee to incorporate, establish a FTID, then.... what? Sit there and hope for the best? If you are an established company seeing a decline in sales over the last 2 years there’s nothing you can do to try and reverse the trend? I’m not pumping a case, its pretty obvious that taking out debt to start a business, while still has risk, is significantly less risky than dumping it into a speculative investment.

Are you implying my purchase of .064 bitcoin at $7600 isn’t going to make me a billionaire by the end of the week?? What did I do this for?!
