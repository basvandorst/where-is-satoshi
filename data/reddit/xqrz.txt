Apparently the CEO is a 23 year old kid that just opened up a bar...

Order id: 3d08445a-1256-4a68-8086-da4cc88215a5
Order is over a week old and the money has never been transferred.

Same, I'll happily report back if they ever send me my money, but I still will point out that it took over 50+ forum posts (across multiple forums), 10+ PMs, emails to 3 bitinstant employees, and a ton of bitching.
I've been incredibly patient, and today my patience wore out. They've had over a week to send me my coins.

No, issue has not yet been resolved.

I wouldn't go jumping to conclusions just yet guys, it's been over a week and bitinstant is still holding my coins hostage. In the past few hours I've seen at least 20 new claims of missing money as well on the bitcointalk forums. 
Even if they're eventually responding to people that complain on every board they can find, it still doesn't mean the service is anywhere near stable/reliable.
They're only fixing the PR headaches.

At least not yet anyway, not until they can resolve the issues they are having the huge influx of traffic.

No it has not been resolved, funds were never delivered to destination address and funds are gone from mtgox account.

Second ticket submitted.

It's true, I was polite for a week and got shit on because of it. Now I'm hounding every bit instant rep I can find about my order id, which as of right now is still unfulfilled.
What a shit service.

Been waiting to receive the funds since 4/2
Transfer was never successfully completed to the destination address listed on the order id.

Clark Moody's chart is awesome.
If you really want to lose some productivity though, switch over to sierra charts...
