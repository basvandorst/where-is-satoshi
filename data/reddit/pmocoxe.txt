Should have named it Coinrush! kekekekeke
Just kidding \^\^
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:42:23
I think it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem: People will only use bitcoin if enough merchants accept it, because otherwise it's just not worth the trouble for them.
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:46:23
I don't know! Where is when you need him...
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:54:29
If reddit doesn't want me to vote in these threads, then why is it showing me the vote buttons?
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:36:32
I agree that it's not obvious how statistically significant these results really are. Could be random variance.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:51:06
Shillslayer? Lol more like shitsayer! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:00:54
He said they won't make an altcoin. He even repeated it three times :-)
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:38:30
You're a real top mind! Thank you for being here for us delusional captains of industry! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:11:00
That is kind of an ignorant thing to say.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:26:53
I installed from git last week and it worked without issues.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:52:42
I have no idea what  you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:42:13
BashCo is black?
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:29:03
What's the second rule?
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:26:39
Thanks you too :)
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:13:51
Sorry for hijacking the top reply, but the rest of the thread is kind of... in the hand of the usual suspects again.
I wonder why nobody has mentioned invertible bloom filters as one of the most promising solutions to the block limit problem:
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:50:58
Buttsex! It's definitely buttsex!
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:25:53
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:22:27
Are you the bitcoin santa?
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:02:41
Are you still educating?
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:45:49
Thanks, Obama!
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:02:46
But what if the rules are stupid?
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:49:04
Are you really a bitcoin specialist?
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:03:19
I haven't seen anything educational from you yet but I'll be on the lookout from now on.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:32:54
I'm so jealous. I wish any hair salons would accept bitcoin where I live.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:36:52
It's actually a fairly good wallet if you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:15:00
zoidberg... but I have no idea what I'm doing haha
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:49:09
Ok, why has nobody explained yet why this is all wrong and lies and how it's going to kill bitcoin? Are they sleeping?
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:40:59
All your base are belong to us!
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:55:05
Snorting bitcoins should be illegal. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:57:56
Wow everywhere I go you've already been there. And everytime I see you you're making a sarcastic remark about the quality of something other people wrote. Is that all you do here? Seems kind of destructive.
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:45:05
Are you sure that's how it works?
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:25:04
It's more like neutral for bitcoin I think.
@_date: 2014-12-08 10:43:17
This should work as well:
    $ printf ok | sha256sum
@_date: 2014-12-31 07:45:17
I nominate you for worst troll of the year.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:35:21
Yeah, proof of stake, that's what I was confusing POS with ...
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:06:08
I can agree with that :-)
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:24:57
The specialst has spoken! Thanks, BitcoinSpecialist!
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:00:50
Don't downvote the BitcoinSpecialist, he's special!
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:41:20
This is just another bait thread for altcoin spam.
@_date: 2014-12-25 11:16:08
Merry Christmas AnalyzerX7!
@_date: 2014-12-25 14:57:22
Thank you and merry Christmas to you too Phucknhell!
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:14:11
What is it? it won't load for me.
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:49:53
It's not a bad idea just because you say that it is a bad idea. Admit it, you just don't want to publicly wear the dunce hat. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:31:04
This is a suspicious comment.
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:33:08
You sound like a real expert!
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:37:24
How can bitcoins be real if our eyes aren't real!?
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:58:30
There seem to be a lot of these lately.
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:20:46
Hey that's a good point. If I make my own cryptocurreny, do you think people will use it too? Or maybe everyone should make their own cryptocurrency, then everyone can use their own money. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:42:27
Mods don't care.
@_date: 2014-12-21 03:11:20
I'm almost glad that bitcoin isn't among *these* things!
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:34:52
I blame Obama!
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:13:16
TIL fiat money has no real value because paper isn't scarce.
That shillsayer guy really doesn't seem very smart.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:30:24
What are threshold signatures?
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:14:02
Uh, okay?
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:22:57
Haha, gotta love how people's first reaction is omg money laundering! so funny.
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:57:01
Wow. And I thought buying reddit gold with bitcoins was pretty cool already.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:59:29
One reason is that armory's performance is seriously lacking when building its synchronization database. It takes fucking forever while bitcoin core is already fully synchronized.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:46:41
over 9000
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:15:19
Yeah that's not very nice.
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:16:37
Yeah man, because some Bitcoiners are stupid makes it okay for CNN to be stupid. Thanks, Obama!
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:12:35
Why do you think that everyone who uses bitcoin is anti government?
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:51:33
This subreddit is full of clowns who spend their whole day trying to convince people that bitcoin is the devil. I mean just look at the comment history of some of these  trolls.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:44:11
I heard he's like a genius or something.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:04:06
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:11:45
Yeah, you keep saying that.
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:33:36
That's really sad. Shows how some people are only interested in bitcoin to make a quick buck. I know it's wrong, but somehow I feel they deserve their losses.
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:36:36
Go elf yourself! Hohohoho!
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:46:08
Omg go back to kindergarten. Seriously wtf kind of childish bullshit is this?
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:56:37
Bitcoin still  oh yeah!!
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:06:34
I heard ripple is bad. Don't want no nothing to do with that ok?
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:13:58
Maybe he was a rich banker who got disgusted with the bankster world and he doesn't need any more money.
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:59:17
I thought it was funny too. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 00:10:49
But I don't have an iphone :(
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:49:12
Bitcoin's killer app is money. who would have thought.
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:54:10
Why is this a problem?
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:55:53
 Crazy. And I haven't even used bitcoin since it went under $300.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:23:33
Nothing wrong with a little competition.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:25:34
Uses punctuation marks.
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:16:03
Keep dreaming.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:48:44
Hahaha! It seems your naming all three including Eric Vorhees in the same sentence was a bit too subtle :-)
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:33:09
Are a also a bank specialist? Wow!
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:22:23
I'm not Pancake, but I read it all, and it is one of the truest postings I've read on here in a while. I really hope Pancake reads it too.
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:32:47
Who is Homero?
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:50:51
Can't be long now.
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:30:19
I hope he gets the shit beaten out of him by some of his disgruntled followers at some point.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:48:39
What a crybaby!
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:58:09
Free speech for everyone.. so long as you don't talk about me.
@_date: 2015-01-01 10:23:33
I should visit Mexico on new year's!
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:59:08
Troll invasion in 3.. 2.. 1..
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:55:05
I don't think Bill Gates is in this to make more money.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:04:47
That guy is so yesterday's news already!
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:31:40
Is that Theymos?
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:39:21
I'm not spending bitcoins while the price is under $300. No way.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:26:37
For real. This kind of behavior gives the affected people an even bigger incentive to use bitcoin instead of a bank transfer in the future. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:16:31
Oh wow that was unexpected. Thank you bitcoinideadude!
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:42:42
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:44:12
My estimate is that it's 90%. My estimate us bigger than yours!
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:22:30
Everyone and their dog is integrating Bitcoin somehow, and the price is all like "It's dead Jim!". What gives?
