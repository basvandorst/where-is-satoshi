becasue its not same as IRC ! there will be more features , which will make it friendly than IRC.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:56:15
200 coin good ?
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:57:17
someday = 15 years
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:56:00
save it
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:34:43


250 bitcoins = You are "one in 84000", i.e. only one out of 84000 people owns 250 BTC; or only 84000 people out of 7 Billion (0.0012%).
Its me XD , until now i have 220 btc , working to get more before price going to 800$ +++
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:31:19
about encrypting chat , i think will be added , yes will be a option for private chat like IRC.
Will there be different sorts of topics? = i think we will start it as instant chat like IRC there is no topics becasue this is already available in bitcoinforum , so will will start with instant chat first , maybe we can added topics idea fi the users ask for that.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:26:57
no not like facebook , its instant chat no newsfeed , but if the feature of newsfeed is good i can added it , i'm here to see what features will make the site better and friendly
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:19:49
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:54:30
the million dollar question is !? do we need verify or not to trade or withdrawal up 3k$ in new site 
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:05:20
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:21:16
check your brain ! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:34:24
none know ... 100k or more or low than that maybe
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:54:21
same happened to me , its keep telling me password did't unlock the wallet , the pass is correct 100%
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:34:27
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:39:29
30$ = 0.0063157894736842 ( 4750$ ) so when the price of btc go to 10k per coin you btc will worth 60$ , its up to you now if that oky or not.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:32:53
i just tried to deposit using btc in SKRILL via bitpay , and when they redirect me to bitpay to pay they ask me for verify myself to pay the invoice ! what a BS service
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:15:48
bitstamp has btc over 6300 too
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:28:34
to people who say why you use bitpay service ! there is no alternative way , I WANT DEPOSITE BTC in skrill , and skrill linked to bitshit , so to deposite they will redirect you to bitshit , bitshit will ask you to verify to send them money , which is BS
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:40:03
yes sell your btc so others can buy it cheap...
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:34:14
i dotn use them , just because SKRILL use that shit service
