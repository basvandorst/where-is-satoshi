Note. Ukraine_Orphans is an anonymous fundraiser and appear masked in photos with unidentified children. Ukraine_Orphans refuses consequence to identify himself and mention any names of his partners in Ukraine. Many very simple questions is not answered. There are so many inconsistencies and much of what he says is quite unsubstantiated and not serious that it is questionable whether his cause at all will benefit these children. That's my opinion. Support instead those loverly Ukrainian kids by an American or European organization which operates serious in Ukraine.

And they are all on facebook. They don't need to hide anything at all.

Hello everyone.
If you already have donated funds to this anonymous and masked guy, go to Indiegogo and ask you money or bitcoins back. There are so many endless indications that this fundraising is more about to fill his own wallet than really helping these Ukrainian Orphans. It's true their home is destroyed but no matter what they are not homeless! According to this Ukrainian article from July 29th,  most of the kids are in Svyatohirsk and not in Kharkiv as claimed. Svyatohirsk is a little town near Slavyansk. The journalist also writes that the authorities are going to fix the orphanage. Therefore, the Ukrainian government does not need help from you and me to rebuild the orphanage. But Ukranian orphanages are underfunded so they can easily need ours help. Do not ever trust anonymous and masked people. they usually have bad intentions. If you want to help Ukrainian orphans with funds or clothes/shoes, here is a list of recognized and official organizations:
You can also google for other countries. Children all over the world can use your help.
Have i nice day.
