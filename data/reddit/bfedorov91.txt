Yup, another big shake down is coming.  Alt coins will follow btc though.. best to go fiat and wait for the dust to settle.

HODL ON!!!
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:14:53
I'll be taking a safety dump around then.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:35:24
what if it doesn't crash this time?  Sounds like you don't trust your exchange.. which is why I use coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:35:02
It has to clear from your bank.. it has nothing to do with the limit.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:17:40
You don't stay up to 3am for some good market action?
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:02:52
Because it is them.  That's exactly why btc hasn't been squashed and is getting some news coverage (mostly internet only).   Yeah, a decentralized currency taking over a world owned by banks.. Okay.   
I believed in bitcoin, read up on it for months, bought the hype, bought in a couple week ago.. 30 minutes into trading it is so obvious the markets are bots.  They do the same pattern for half the day, then sudden movement for a couple hours, then nothing for another 8 hours.  It is straight up gambling.  Period.     
Exchanges cheat people out of trades.  You place a trade at a certain amount and gives you another.  Exchanges get dos'd and stop working in pivotal moments.   Watch, more of them will go under and all the money gone.      
These people are buying a new super secure payment system for the banks and it will save them a ton of money in the long run.  They're out sourcing all the hardware and IT.  Eventually something will happen to bitcoin and something new will snake in.  It will be plastered all over the media and come preinstalled on every phone.. it'll be like btc never happened.     
oh yeah, and the guy that invented it doesn't exist.. how convenient.  
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:07:57
where will it stop????
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:19:09
But how will they allow scammers to ship back empty boxes and force payment reversals?  Ebay is such crap now.

Just placed a 5lb order.  Making the switch from a tassimo to a hario.  As someone that drinks up to 3 large cups a day, I'm pretty excited.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:02:30
If that is true, then price should stay high because of demand right?
@_date: 2015-10-28 14:02:43
I feel like this is more about collecting the data so they can sell it as opposed to collecting it to "watch you."  They need money.   Just look at who was for it and against it.   
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:13:04
Need places to spend it first.
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:16:01
He is still thinking of a way to steal everything and take credit.
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:09:50
It is not sold by sears.  It is a third party marketplace like every other large retailer.
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:14:41
Read the terms.  They have to tell you if they are pulling a report.
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:50:45
I thought that was a given..
@_date: 2015-10-17 05:25:53
    
Pops in my head every time I check price.. not sure if good thing or bad...
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:47:55
the auction imo
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:23:10
Just because it crashed last time doesn't mean it will this time.  I would set an alarm for the next large amount of movement and decide then.  I would probably end up buying.  If you don't you'll miss the boat.. if you do and it crashes, you still have x number of coins and it should go back up at some point.  Pretty sure bitcoin will not be a success if it stay at 350 or less forever.
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:31:13
If only they were authorized key resellers.  I'd rather not take the chance of having my 600+ game steam account banned for receiving a stolen key.   One day the ban hammer will come down and everybody will cry.  Do not support these companies.
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:06:41
Good stuff.. got me some silver a few months ago.     
Do they charge the cash price for it then?
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:50:31
The whole bubble hype was done on purpose so everyone would hang on and not cash out at 500.  They hyped it up to get people to buy in around the 400s and now they're going to collect that money.  It is going nowhere but down like I said.  Anyone with half a brain can tell the markets' movement are not natural.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:55:07
Should add, "Thank you for your BCC."
@_date: 2015-10-22 19:20:18
I reserved "Bitcoin" in my state last week.  Was surprised it was still available since I'm in the banking state.
@_date: 2015-10-31 23:18:21
Yeah, I was about to say... this time we have china.  Short during the day, buy at night ;)

A few publishers have pulled keys.  The key stores will give you another in most cases.  Farcry 4, published by Ubisoft, had a massive key revoke around release.  They ended up reinstating some.      
Go read the steam and pc gaming subs.  There are always cases of people with massive decade old accounts getting banned with zero reasoning.  It is probably because they buy half their games from these sites.        
Steam Subscriber Agreement.     
*F. Steam Authorized Resellers   
You may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve. The "Product Key" accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription. If you purchase a Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions regarding the Product Key to that reseller.*      
By activating a key from a non-authorized reseller, you are breaking the agreement.        
Far Cry 4 EULA
**The Product may not be re-exported**, *downloaded or otherwise exported to, or installed by a national or resident of, any country to which the United States has embargoed goods, or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders. You represent and warrant that You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list.*    
In addition to using dirty funds, the sites buy keys from other regions at a lower prices and resell to other regions with higher prices.   
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:51:58
No.  If they were getting keys from the publisher, the ONE place where the keys originate from, they would be authorized resellers.. but they're not.  They do buy some keys legitimately, but they will buy bulk keys (stolen) from third parties with dirty money.  That why they can undercut everyone else.   It lowers their cost per key.     
In addition, they allow third parties to sell keys through their site for a percentage.  Most are stolen.  Why do you think they sell you "g2a shield?"  If they were legit keys there would be no need for it.  
@_date: 2015-10-31 18:42:34
why can't it go up as quick as it went down?
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:33:44
I have a feeling that was the bubble.

Old news.     
But yeah, it is extremely obvious that that speech was handed to her monments before reading it.  She stops and reads ahead.  Then walks off stage seconds later.       
Moment of realization that her name will be the one in the history books when the dollar collapsed.  The fall woman.   
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:22:57
Yes, it's 1 to 1.  
Depends on where your BTC is stored.. ie, coinbase is not supporting it, so you won't get it.  If you get it, you'll have to transfer it to an exchange that supports it.  
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:08:53
ding ding ding.  I'm taking a dump till the next wave after that auction.
@_date: 2015-10-18 03:14:32
and one day your steam account could banned because they sold you a stolen key. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:03:31
I know people say it a lot.. but it really looks like they're getting ready to pull the plug soon.. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:12:00
check their twitter
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:30:14
its the auction
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:56:06
Pretty noob question.. but what would have happened if they were online?  If you tried to sell a coin to get out, who would be there to buy it?  The exchange would eat it if it dropped more?  
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:20:44
How do you know they're not doing it on purpose?  Not like any shady ever happens with BTC and exchanges....
