This exactly, greed aside, everyone who sells at any point besides ATH still makes it on top, it's not healthy to dwell over the coulda/shoulda/woulda

Not really, they (BCH) have a fork lined up for tomorrow that changes the way their difficulty changes. Furthermore, BTC difficulty adjusts in 20 days, we lost 50% of hashate but the difficulty is going to be same anyway untill the next adjustment, miners are probably going to make the same amount of money if they return.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:29:51
Instead of just blaming them, I think we should look into the validity of point 3. Bitcoin core devs need to take this seriously, cause those gready basterds won't stop until they lose all their money.

pretty fortunate that Bithumb crashed/ddos'ed/taken down. Now they are trying to say that they are under attack and that [BCH is not centralized]( when they already [admitted]( that it is yesterday.

Assuming they sell it on an exchange, it's possible to sell it directly to another entity without affecting the market price (except their own price leverage).
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:39:25
I don't know, to be honest, I only started looking into it after waking up to a portfolio that $2k lighter.
What I know is that the attack isn't over yet.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:10:41
Where are the mods?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:32:09
Bitcoin Cash has a fork lined up for the 13th that changes the way difficulty adjustment works. Makes it dynamically change every 10 minutes.
It was announced on the 31st of last month, so It's was defiantly made with this attack in mind.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:01:57
I'm not complaining, Made it back by putting into BCH and taking it out before it crashed, thanks for the pump and dump friend.
Also, I didn't get in before the fork, I'm pretty sure that there is a significant number of people lost confidence in crypto today thanks to your little tantrum.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:20:58
Dip isn't over, this might get us to 7-6.5k!
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:14:11
[Hashrate dropped by 50%]( thanks to the BCash attack and the [number of transactions due to the panic is huge]( Just hold on, it will eventually get processed. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:41:54
I'm actually pretty sure that if anything of this is true then the real result is 1) Bitfinex is in on the scam 2) Bitfinex is insolvent.
Any panic means that Bitfinex won't be able to actually give you your CryptoCurrency back.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:03:47
That's assuming they don't try to pump up the price like they did 12 hours ago. Also, we are assuming that miners switching to the profitable chain, but I suspect that they are getting paid to switch with what might be a profit guarantee agreement.
Otherwise I totally agree with you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:57:53
Why become a member of the market when you can own the whole market? Yeah pretty much.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:25:53
20 days from now, bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 20 days and the last one was yesterday. Miners pumped Bitcoin difficulty right until the difficulty adjusted and then started the attack by switching to BCash, smart move really.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:31:04
[Here]( and [here]( The second link also gives the next adjustment time and hash rate.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:45:35
It looks like a Monero type of hardfork, Just a version pump with some adjustments.
Buuut, I remember seeing a post on (Bitcoin Cash headquarters) about 12 hours announcing a fork called CASH, probably just some counter FUD. CASH is supposed to be the current bitcoin cash without the difficulty adjustment change.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:51:34
The other side of the world is sleeping, the real effects might show up in 12 hours. But, I hope this is the real effect, I wanted to exit at $8,500
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:18:06
How much did you sell? I sold 0.08220071 Feels bad man
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:59:01
What do you need the bitcoins for? Go for it you are planning to save it up, but I question the idea of selling your source of income in-order to make savings that you might end up spending.
But you are going to sell the bitcoins then just get cash, It's a minor hassle to convert it but let the buyer do it.
Either-way, You are getting Bitcoin at an all time high value, It might drop to $4000 next week or $6000 the week after so unless you are thinking long term or don't mind savings volatility do not get bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:06:04
Diffidently better to keep it on your own wallet (Electrum), just make sure that your Desktop/whateverdevice is secure and of-course backup the wallet seed key somewhere safe (print it offline).
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:24:16
Well, it ought to drop down again in a few hours....don't sell more than 20% until the Chinese finally announce something concrete.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:42:08
why not Electrum? It's free, just download the app from electrum.org (reminder: double check any url before proceeding to download)
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:43:47


Exactly what I say; Never think of touching CryptoCurrency with money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:34:24
I still tell my friends that they are idiots for thinking about investing their savings in bitcoin, but I do help after explaining the risk if they insist.
CryptoCurrency is very speculative.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:50:38
How much did you buy them for? Anyway, It's always a good idea to split your savings over multiple accounts.
I doubt you had a keyloger, check if you backed up your seed online somewhere like you email.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:55:51
wait, Bitcoin Gold and B2X are two different things? This is out of control.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:59:39
check google photos, microsoft onedrive, apple shitthing, dropbox, MEGA; All of those had automatic photo backup for quite a while and hopefully, you'll find it there.
You second best option is to buy a 9.5 bitcoin now ^^^^lul
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:54:21
Good move, just bad advice for people only thinking of selling now. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:52:13
Bad bad advice, not only is it too late to dumb (Never dumb on the dip) but at least 1% of the alts are useful.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:40:16
How do I get my B2X if I'm running my own wallet? (Electrum)
