What's funny is Yang actually advocates for automation...

For the necessary 8 years of education to be able to make real progress in the field, less than 100k a year is remarkably low, this is considering tenure as well.

Bitcoin Futures? Time to train a neural net on price prediction...

As a safeguard to automation. Tesla's can drive coast to coast. In 10 years, what will happen to the 4 million trucking jobs? What about when cashiers get completely phased out? When McDonald's automated Mcdouble production?
With no jobs for so many Americans, consume spending goes down, causing businesses to stagnate. This is a self-perpetuating cycle.
Thus UBI gives people breathing room, while also, under Yang, doing away with welfare which is readily abused and enabling for societies slackers.
People say UBI will make people lazy, but 12k a year? Can people really live off that doing nothing but sitting around?

He's not against automation at all, in fact he is encouraging it under the stipulation that the American people get there fair share of the resulting skyrocketing of business revenues.

All you anti-yang people are gonna be in for a nasty surprise with automation in 5-10 years if he is not elected.

Maximizing shareholder profit, the cornerstone of capitalism.
 I'll point out that under Yangs plan, inflation would not increase as no new money is being printed. As for cutting income tax, doing such a thing would disproportionately benefit the rich, as low income earners pay the least % off there paychecks.


It was also at an all time low in the 20's, and then the great depression happened. With macroeconomics, current indicators done predict future performance very reliably, particularly employment levels.


What if my desire in life is to do Quantum physics, but as such a career is not sought after in the free market, I am forced to work a dead end job? What Picassos, what Einstein's, what Steven Hawking's are out there, dying to utilize there gifts, some of which would arguably create a lasting, positive impact for humanity, but are unable to, due to the shackles of trickle-down economics?

What is your proposal for incentives for hiring humans?
The assembly line put tens of thousands out of work, but the result was cheaper goods for the consumer, and more technologically advanced vehicles. Are you willing to stunt technological growth, and artificially keep the price of goods inflated, just to keep people employed? What happens if other countries do go full automation and there companies want to sell us goods at drastically cheaper prices than our domestic counterparts? More tariffs?
That sounds like it would take a terrifyingly large government to maintain... Why not maximize individual freedoms, minimize government and safeguard people against automation by giving a dividend to all (legal) citizens? The revenues companies will gain from automating will far surpass the taxes excised against them to ensure the eradication of poverty, and the assurance of a bright future for all Americans.
