A world where bitcoin is the dominant currency would actually be quite dystopian. 
An economy where the return of holding onto your money exceeds any potential return on investment in productive capital is one where investment doesn't actually happen. Deflation serves as a wealth transfer from borrowers to creditors (or spenders to hodlers), it raises the real interest rate in the economy and it effectively raises the cost of capital so high that it smothers out what would otherwise be a virtuous cycle of investment in real assets and subsequent wealth creation. 
In this fictional world where bitcoin is actually used as money, the baked in deflation would function as an invisible tax which flows to holders of bitcoin from those who spend and use it for normal transactions. This combined with a range of other rents, fees charged by miners for clearing services, and the continuously escalating demand for electricity to drive hashing would replace what is a relatively benign financier class with an incomparably worse arrangement. It would be trustless yes, it would be decentralized, but worse it would be immutable, static and profoundly wasteful.
Gold was abandoned as a base for currency for a variety of reasons, but most importantly because it made for terrible money. Bitcoin is terrible as money, and gold is way better at being gold than bitcoin is.
Blockchain is great, I see immense potential for decentralized public ledgers of ownership for a variety of different assets , but I really don't know what bitcoin itself has to offer or does for me. That isn't to say that the technical implementation of bitcoin isn't fascinating or interesting in its own right, I just question the way it is currently conceived.
