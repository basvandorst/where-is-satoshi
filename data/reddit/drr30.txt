Ripple is a decentralised crypto currency. 
If you don't want trustlessness just put numbers in a database like Visa or a bank. It's like millions of times more efficient. 
They are promising big things but it's about what you actually deliver.

Literally the only shower available is a group thing and also a group naked sauna thing, so most people are just totally filthy.

Well it does work which is why it's illegal in regulated markets.  They wouldn't bother with laws if you just lost money every time.
From another text: 
"The most common form of price manipulation is ramping, or artificially pushing the price up"

Never works? It does work which is why it's illegal.

We should all get together and do this when BTC gets to 10K

I don't think his point was particularly well argued either - which is probably why he deleted it. Bit of a difficult subject and I don't understand this whole let's debate anything and everything on *twitter*

The way it works is big hedge fund slowly buys a bunch of a small volume coin which is gradually bleeding anyway. They then buy all available volume at increasingly high prices like a ladder until it appears the market is pumping that coin. At this point FOMO kicks in and everyone sell their ETH and BTC to buy the alt. The hedge fund mean while gradually exits during the pump.

He was making the point that if you think decriminalizing drugs doesn't cause harm then what about cp? 
I think he was trying to make the point that decriminalization isn't harmless -  not defending cp. But it will be taken out of context with just the one tweet shown of course... 
Dumb ass thing to talk about on twitter - not a particularly subtle platform. Smart guy but this was a bit insensitive.

I meant insensitive - while being insensitive myself :/ my bad - I corrected it.

He was arguing that if you think decriminalizing drugs doesn't hurt anyone then what about cp? He was saying drugs are bad not cp is good - but dug himself into hole. Of course will be taken out of context now - shouldn't be talking about that stuff on twitter anyway...

Well it's Turing complete if there is infinite ether for gas - but as a partial investor I hope it does eventually have a cap. In that most likely case then it's not Turing by complete as you can put a bound on the number of loops (halting problem).

I have a bunch of those from my grandfather. He sold all his assets when the new government came in and walked the money out as gold in his shoes. Bitcoins would have been easier !
