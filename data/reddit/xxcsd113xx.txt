Right but the people who call it that are wrong, we need to use correct terminology in this area

A node without hash power is a relay node, a node with hash power is a full node.  Has nobody here even read the whitepaper
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:33:53
There is no diffrence, if it is not mining then it is just a relay node, with hashpower behind it it then becomes a full node
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:57:37
Its a node, but it’s not a full node, a full node has hash power behind it, without hashpower it can only send the transaction info along to another node until it eventually reaches one with hash power

Thank you Very much!

intel core i5 ivy bridge, 4GB of ddr3 1600mhz, wd blue hdd

Thank you Very much, this helps a ton!

it is pulling around 200w under load

Every little bit helps, but larger nodes are far more reliable and more likely to first relay a block

A pi can run a node with only a few connections, I've been able to get around 9 before I hit 100% cpu.  If you overclock one I'm sure you could get a few more connections.

i like this idea. 100 bit

thanks for the reminder, i have revised the post to respect the rules.

Thank you Very much!

That and raspberry pi's work well as low power nodes.
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:56:34
thanks for the reminder, i have removed the rule offending text.

With 1.5k you should look at a hardware wallet, the ledger nano s is on sale all the time
@_date: 2019-10-13 00:42:55
Up to 21 million

You don't, but you also don't know your computer isint backdoored, your router, your phone.  How do you know your copy of the Bitcoin software you downloaded isint a malicious version.  You don't, at a certain point with all of this you need to trust that it isint

Paper wallets are fantastic as offline cold storage, hardware wallets are designed to leverage security while at the same time usability, with a paper wallet every time you want to use it you must reveal your private key and risk theft.  Hardware systems are the best of both worlds.

You buy another one and restore with the 24 words you wrote down and stored while first initializing the device
Or restore into any bip24 compatable wallet
@_date: 2019-09-08 07:49:32
You know, you could just instead get a cold storage Bitcoin wallet.....
Idk why you would purchase a secure hot wallet device and wish it was the exact opposite
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:03:25
If you want a wallet that is cold storage and only supports Bitcoin there is a hardware wallet for that it's called opendime.  Why wish ledger was something different when you could just purchase that different thing, I don't understand the point of your comment.
