It's hard to fight the invisible hand with shadow money.

A country recognized by 113 UN members doesn't exist, including all it's neighbors except Serbia?  
Sounds like it exists to me.

You countered my comment that the majority is social and domestic spending is causing the debt, therefore you are arguing that the majority is defense.  Unless you are arguing that one adds to the debt and the other doesn't, which would mean we aren't arguing the same thing.

It's actually increases in social and domestic spending that is mostly increasing debt.  War spending doesn't help, but wars can end and social spending never stops.

I can agree with that, and you're right you didn't write that.

The military is discretionary spending which requires approval in a law yearly, and makes it the most easy to cut.  Social and domestic programs are mandatory spending and nearly impossible to cut, and they keep growing, paid for by debt. 
You want to blame the military and the wars alone for our monetary problems, but ignore the true issues.  Yes war industry is a problem but not the biggest problem.

After two terms he had to leave, I wouldn't say he got away.  He delayed the crash, and so did Obama.  The big one is coming no matter what the Paul Krugman and his buddies say.  The government can only use debt so long to delay the crash before the can't anymore.  The economy needs a natural crash to fix our long term problems.  The market needs risk.

Dude, you are all over the place.  Everyone gets emotional about money, I know, but the solution requires a logical, not emotional, solution.  I am a Tea Partier, I'm more libertarian than most, but the Tea Party isn't really a one minded group, just like many movements.  It was mainly a movement that wanted lower taxes and less government spending.
Rome fell because of debt, we can fall just like them.  It's a good analogy because we should learn things from the past.  Common sense, what common sense?  Most countries has big debt, most countries want nanny and police states, most countries don't want classical liberalism or small governments.
Guess what, I'm in the south too, but the size off government has little to do with the protection of rights.  A large government does not mean freedom, usually the exact opposite.  But that all comes down to if you believe government can be "good" or it is a necessary evil.  A small but capable federal government would just as well create freedom without being a tyranny. 
I have no idea where you last part was going.  However the common defense is one of the few legitimate federal government roles.  The military should be limited, they should not be international police.

The war isn't cheap but you're still wrong about what is the majority cause of federal debt. Taking a look at the data over time [here]( and  [here]( we see that social security and medicare account for 2.2 trillion in spending with defense at about 1 trillion.  
You'll also notice that Bush added about 3 trillion to the debt but Obama added about 7 trillion.  Obama did much worse while "trying to end wars."  Not to make it too political, both presidents have been bad with taxpayer dollars with war, but congress is the worst of the bunch back here at home.

I never stated that, in fact I specifically stated "mostly increasing debt" as in the majority of increasing national debt is social and domestic spending, not defense spending.  I even went on to acknowledge the impact of war spending on debt.  You are being totally exclusionary towards other spending, placing the vast majority of blame on defense spending.  
How much does the US spend, as a percentage of government spending, on defense?

Some studies suggest low taxes with a board tax base and low spending is the way to go and I have to agree.  Stop the progressive tax, maybe end income tax all together, cut spending by a whole bunch, stop the managed economy and let it fail so the weak businesses fail, and last return power back to the states.  It isn't the emotionally easy way to go, but we need to pay off our debts or we will fail like Rome.

That graph is terrible at showing actual data, Obama made way more debt than Bush did.  Both presidents were bad for the taxpayers.

I just did mine and it was 1100 inclusive of the court filing fees.  5k is way too much, as a contested divorce here was 7.5k.
