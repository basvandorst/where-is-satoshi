eh, i mean... really if a hacker is going to hack his server and modify his code zip file... the guys going to probably forge the signature also. Especially since it says "there is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner"
That is typically the problem when you host the signatures and the verification codes on the same server as the file you are trying to verify. really they need to be stored on different services.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:23:56
only if they were willing to buy, and pay the price. i doubt the price would have been as much as they are getting from using the hack. Some people don't mind burning the world down around them.

That looks like it's a Thermal Printer. Those wallets are heat sensitive. I know you are not supposed to leave them laying around out in the sun or on your toaster but if they got exposed to some heat, it would make them unreadable.

People don't think rationally around these things they just think segwit will solve all their problems so anyone not on board is the problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:09:49
what alternative has your money insured? Segwit wont get your money back if they get hacked. A proven track record for attention to detail, testing and insurance do.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:18:00
I don't get how you can say it's the community at blame because they don't like a solution they were given. What if you went to a food place and asked for a burger and they gave you chicken fingers? Is that your fault somehow for not wanting chicken fingers? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:25:22
It's on their site they are fdic insured for usd balance and the whole 2% hot wallet is insured privately. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:00:32
I think its historically hard to change humans from something they already know and use to something new just for the sake of someone saying "we need to do this for the greater good!" They need a real tangible benefit to move. When you are talking about coinbase, an insured secure with a good track record bitcoin exchange, why would they want to move stuff somewhere possibly less secure because some dude on reddit is crying about segwit adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:58:26
Fair enough. But I believe it's more than almost any other option is offering. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:40:39
I think its honestly to late unless a merchant can start using lightning without having to re-write all their current bitcoin payment processing tech.

But if you get cut off from half the world the chain splits.... Seems like a problem.
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:21:24
But in that situation, say I'm on the losing chain with 100 BTC of transactions buying goods. The reorg happens... I send my 100 BTC back to myself at a different address at a higher fee.. That would confirm before all the rebroadcast transactions. I get my money back keep the goods and the sellers lose.
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:05:40
I'm not sure on that...I mean I don't know technically if you are right... But it's not something I have ever heard of... Transactions getting shucked back to mempool ? Where did you learn this?
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:36:48
Yeah but thi king about a long term situation like half the world is cut off for 3 or 4 years? How will that look when they talk again?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:19:21
but the under laying layer is useless when the fees are so high that the only way to effectively transfer bitcoin is through a layer2 system. that is the problem. That is why people get a little upset about the way this is handled. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:19:37
You won the segwit wars because everyone opposing segwit just decided it was easier to fork the chain and run their own coin, thats not winning. If you really take a look around the community it still is very much a war. bch vs bitcoin. Bitcoin may have the major dollars but BCH is valued pretty highly also and i honestly would not be surprised if they launch BCH in january as a trade-able  currency. Once they do that they will find out which chain is the one the people want and they will act accordingly. BCH is not on an even playing field right now because coinbase only supports BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:48
yyeeup pretty much. being butt hurt doesnt change the facts. haha. The real thing to watch is the long term. where does it settle?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:45:33
and now hes going to sell bch low, buy BTC high, and watch a correction come in and hes going to continue the streak.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:08:42
the fact that the Core wallet cannot even be bothered to implement the segwit gui addresses is probably your biggest problem. who will take it seriously if the creators themselves cannot be bothered?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:55:47

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:16:21
i dont think you can compare the two like that. The client in bitcoins case would be the wallet software. You would need some 3rd party to host TorLightning2 Channels that lay on top of the current tor nodes that gives you faster access to tor network data by being a trusted party to all the people connecting to it to access the data. and honestly who in their right mind would choose to use that?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:26:32

@_date: 2017-12-15 17:32:13
well unfortunately they do not use redditas their support forum so i doubt they pay that close attention to it. Also, i just went to top and looked through all the most voted posts all the way to about 5000 upvotes. i did not see one post about coinbase adopting segwit or a request for them to do so. Maybe i missed it, but assume it was a post that got 10000 upvotes. how many customers do they have? what percentage of their customers is 10000 people (who are just upvoting a post on reddit after all not submitting a feature request to coinbase)? I think you are a little off your mark here.  
For the record coinbase reported 11.7 million users in october this year. lets do the basic math and come to 10000 people on reddit is .085 % of the coinbase userbase. 
The HIGHEST upvoted post is 47.8 K...thats still only 0.4% of their userbase.

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:10:13
I honestly do not believe that block size increases will drive as much centralization as some thing honestly. At least not any more than it already is with 1 mb blocks. i mean how many days does it take to sync a full node right now? How many people just do not bother because it is a hassle. The only people doing nodes are the people that already want to put up with that, and that will always be the case. so block size is likely not going to push those people out of the ecosystem because they are the people who will be willing to go that extra bit to get that bigger disk drive or subscribe to a slightly faster internet connection. The only way you push these people out also is if the size of blocks goes up so fast that it outpaces technology growth, and that i dont think will be likely. Though it would be a great problem to have.
but again why wouldn't you increase the block size now like cash did? then when the Segwit/lightning stuff is in place and makes a difference reduce it down  again? it just does not make sense the way this is handled it is very... elitist.  "well that just adds complexity and takes away resources from developing lightning...well what ever. i guess you guys don't really want bitcoin adoption to grow because you are trying really hard to make it hard to use and unappealing to about anyone who would really want to use it. what happens if everyone has moved on in the next 18 months (1 year and 6 months, possibly longer)? lightning network wont be a whole lot of good if no ones bothering to use bitcoin at all anymore because it let this petty problem fester for years.
If you look at almost any other problem in any other product that is significant in size, you will almost always see a short term less optimal fix for it that gets things somewhat better, then a longer term optimized fix that overrides the sub optimal fix. Why is it ok to suffer these ridiculous fees now when we can help that now? it looks a lot like someone is scared that once the cat is out of the bag it wont go back in and they need the cat in the bag to make their product work in the short term.
I know this sounds anti-bitcoin, pro bitcoin cash but believe me it is not, it is a guy between two systems that that is trying to decide which one works better, and cash works better now, which means its more usable and desirable now. But i also think lightning network will be a huge benefit also to everyone but in the short term bitcoin has no real usable value unless you only care about speculating on the price.

They are getting compensated with the block reward. they would continue to get compensated with small fees from a large number of people in the future, but instead they are going to be getting large fees from small amounts of people because of the limit. I dont 100% know if lightning helps in all situations. i don't know a ton about the exact way it is expected to work for a company like mcdonalds or a coffee shop. Theoretically you pay 2 on chain fees to transact. how much coffee do you drink i n a week? if i have to pay 30 dollars twice to open a channel and to buy coffee, it doesnt make sense to do so still unless i fund it for a years supply of coffee, and even then thats a pretty good % of the money spent.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:40
what gloves? what are you going to do to coinbase? They are aloud to make their own decisions on what is best for their business. if that does not align with what you want, don't use the service. unfortunately the bulk of people will continue to use their very easy service to get access to crypto. So unless segwit becomes attractive to them in a way that makes them want to implement it before other things they are finding more attractive right now you are not going to get segwit from coinbase.

not to be a tin foil hat kinda person, but you have to wonder if all the miners in china were actually one operation and at any time could join forces to do whatever they wanted at any time. 
Do we have any proof that the bitcoins mined in china are being put into the spending pool and not hoarded by any entity? If they own a large majority of coins wouldn't they also be in a position to manipulate value?
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:00:29
Yea... i don't know either i was just asking this in another post. I have not done the deep dive on their system but from what i have gathered they seem to be using a security model similar to lastpass. lastpass is pretty secure as far as i know in terms of your data is always encrypted before they get it. 
I think there is a big stigma against online wallets because you have to "trust" that they are doing all the things they say they are doing. But with a phone wallet, i would never feel safe. Especially with these phones getting MMS vulnerabilities and so many others where all you have to do is recieve a text message and they could take over your phone. you don't even have to read it, just the act of your phone receiving it.
This one is patched now, but the vendors are not to quick to jump on getting patches out usually.

Some what related, but i have a question. Lets say the US were to trigger a huge depression like seen before, or maybe worse. If people cannot afford electricity or internet at their homes, how will bitcoin be useful them? I suppose had they kept them on paper wallets in small denominations, then sure maybe you could trade them but how could you verify your not just trading pretty paper? (ironically that's what we do now! haha)

Technically it is. They are not supposed to be able to say "you have to buy at least 5 dollars worth of stuff to pay with credit" etc. thats against the terms of service for Visa. Now, if you report that to the card industry what will happen? I don't know. Will they send a "secret shopper" to verify your claim? Probably not, they might give them a call and warn them... who knows, but to follow the rules they are not supposed to discriminate. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:12:56
I would suspect that the HUGE mining farms that are currently just for profit mine and sell back the BTC to cover costs of living and the operation will close down if they had not already done so with the very small rewards given toward the end.
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:03:38

i am not saying the grid goes down, but lets just say its a depression and people don't have a lot of fiat which is still the defacto currency, but lets say you have 10000 bitcoins. you cannot afford to pay your electic bill with fiat, so you have no computer to use your bitcoin to buy whatever else you might be able to with them? Maybe the electric company will start accepting them i don't know... I guess i just don't see why a potential collapse of the economy is a good reason to invest in bitcoin. if the economy tanks to badly the supporting tech for btc may not be sustainable. I am not even saying that the miners quit. I am just saying that if i have btc, and no way to transact them because i have no power, or computer..... 
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:29:59
I personally wouldn't re-use the Paper Wallet. Once you have your balance on it and store it. if you claim those coins at any exchange or in a wallet program, once they are moved throw it away and create a new one for you next paper wallet need. Once you sweep it the private keys for that wallet are possibly "out there". 
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:42:25
hmm, yea i can see that i guess. Assuming the rest of the world doesnt tank with the USA the bitcoin could be valuable still and perhaps useful to trade for goods. 
Makes me wonder if anyone will come out with a bitcoin wallet hardware that uses whispernet like the kindle does. you don't have to pay for the data connection but its super slow since it doesn't really need to transfer much. but it would be enough to sign and transmit a transaction, look up balance etc.
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:42:35
Yea, I really like Armory but the fact that it requires Bitcoin core client and then its own set of databases is a little much. it takes forever to launch. Plus i think it got close sourced recently or something so that's another reason to bail on it. 
I would never recommend a smart phone wallet. the 4 digit pins most use to unlock are too easy to break. 
I think, if you are using it for long term storage not day to day spend/receive a paper wallet is fine so long as you don't print it on a big corporate printer at the office, or generate it on a computer in a similar environment. Really its difficult and a hassle to properly setup a paper wallet that is secure, just as much so as doing a Cold Storage wallet or even hot wallet that is secure. 
 
I am guessing really in all honesty the easiest thing to do would be to get a hardware wallet that you can use. Then you just toss it on that thing throw it in a safe or in safety deposit box and let it go.

Gotta force that square peg in the round hole man. That's how it works. Everyone probably wants dedicated company support of the solution they support to make it harder for it to make sense for a chain they don't support to survive. if you have a weak chain that is not popular, but you force all the useful utilities onto it then it will by utility be a more agreeable way to go.

is blockchain.info wallet not recommended? I know they are an online wallet and all that but from what i understand they run it similar to how LastPass does their password manager and encrypt the wallet client side with your passwords and then transfer to the server so they don't have any backdoor. Seems to me with that type of security, you should be about as safe as a local wallet as long as blockchain.info is honest in their setup. I guess that is the key.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:31:31
is this thing useable if the company that makes it goes out of business? It looks like they have a chrome browser extension you use. is it completely local or does it require internet connection/pingback to their server to load?
I understand that you can recover from the seed key, but I'm more curious if the device relies on them to be around to function? Also is the recovery seed usable outside their software? Like with electrum or something?

Joinmarket would probably also be an agreeable way to produce some privacy. I cannot say i have used joinmarket at all, but i have it installed and it appears as though it should work. i just have not gotten around to actually doing anything with it yet. for more info.
Using shapeshift means you are relying on shapshift to maintain the secret of you having done the transaction with them. With joinmarket you run multiple transactions with multiple different parties to mix coins so at the other end there is not easy to tell whats come from where. All parties in the Joinmarket transaction are typically looking for the same thing, more privacy.

Could be that they just have a bone to pick. Considering Ver has been a part of trying to fork larger block sizes and being blocked, perhaps they would try to block this in spite.
I don't know anything about anything though, and i saw today that it looks like slush is the only mining pool signaling? I don't know how hard it is for a mining operation to switch to signal... so it may just need more time for other to catch up.... or maybe they do not intend to.

haha so much for bitcoin being outside politics. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:52:43
It is a bit of a catch 22. if you dont get in the next block, and everyone else is using similar fees, you end up in the same state you were in, maybe a smaller subset of the total tx in mempool are considered for the block due to the higher fees paid, but yes its still going to be sitting and waiting, but you will get in blocks faster than everyone from before... assuming they don't all use RPF to increase their own fees.
I realize your /s but i wanted to think it through a bit and write it anyway :)

I think there are a few coins that are actually truly gone for ever. anything sent to the 0 private key i'm pretty sure never come back from the dead without some kind of special exceptions being coded into the protocol.

You can attack specific bitcoin nodes or bitcoin based websites but bitcoin as a protocol will be fine. IE:
You can take down amazon.com or twitter.com but you can still go shop at ebay.com or goto facebook.com. 
Same as with bitcoin, you can loose access to blockchain.info, or maybe a node you would relay transactions through, but there are others that can get you what you need. 
Not the best comparison, but its the basic idea. Nice thing about bitcoin is that if a node or even a bunch of nodes get taken down, there are still others that can take that same transaction.
Perhaps an effective attack would be against the mining groups... either their pools or some how blocking them from registering new blocks they found... If you can stop the miners you stop bitcoin.

it is certainly not an easy problem to solve. i mean you gotta look at the anti GMO and anti VAX movements to see how real world scary that stuff gets. 
But, for around here transparency i think would be a big thing in that. And compromise a bit you know? it seems a bit heavy handed for a set of developers to just sit here with a network effectively crippled by high fees. And they are just like "No this is the right thing to do, you guys sit here and suffer through this while we work on this other 2nd layer stuff that might be out sometime in another year... maybe more, maybe less. we don't know. To some degree you kind of are making your own bed. 
I like segwit, and the 2nd layer stuff. but i also like an usable and fairly priced currency to use. I don't understand why we cannot get a bit of both. If 2nd layer is going to be great and useful it doesn't matter if the block size is 2 mb when it launches. If you are holding back the block size it just looks like you are not so sure about your 2nd layer techs usefulness and thus forcing it on everyone by making everything work like ass today so when it does hit it looks like a god send.

Not a bad idea. would certianly get them out of debt and a nice down payment on a house. I only wonder with their income levels why they are looking at a house so expensive. my wife and i have few debts 1 kid, and we make quite a bit more than they do and we only have a house worth little more than half the lower range. i guess i would chauk it up to being screwed by the USA. sounds like hes not in the USA so maybe their mortgages are much cheaper due to different property taxes?

Right, but where did the bitcoin come from? If it wasn't from coin base good luck proving its legit enough for a bank. Just saying it's something to talk about before you get started. That way you don't tank a deal you are excited about just because of red tape. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:57:01
Lies are a matter of perspective i think in this case. You are looking at two different ways to do the same thing and both sides have some validity. 
Control of the narrative around rbitcoin has been a concern for some while. That alone is hurting everything around bitcoin in general. How do you have open and meaningful dialog with your community if the only thing you allow to be posted is "That a boy!" patting your self on the back type conversation?

Yea. Its a bit of a balance certainly. Student Loan debt i think is one of those accepted expected debts you will have no matter what your financial past looks like. Like a mortgage. Just because it is considered normal...doesn't mean its optimal. Certainly i would rather pay off my loans all now and have all those payments as income for investments otherwise. It will certainly serve me better that way than postponing payoff in hopes of some windfall.

Well, i think the main "not enough food" complaint is that in 50 years we wont be farming enough food to feed everyone at current population growth rates. And it is believed that if we don't start working on solutions now then there will be a lot of hungry people. That's not to say we don't have some efficiency to squeeze out of the current system. that is certainly part of it. Lots of food is wasted every day by people eating more than they need, or stores over producing what they expect to sell and then tossing it into the dumpster. Distribution is also a challenge. I am glad you do your research and make your mind up for yourself but personally i do not believe there is some big conspiracy to poison the people of the USA through GMO crop growing. Maybe you are right and there is some serious problem and at the end of the day we will find out there is a problem with it. I am not saying there are not things to be concerned with. However to the best of my knowledge there is not a reputable verified scientific study saying that there is anything harmful about the stuff. Its only people who claim to know. 90% of it is fear mongering.

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:09:48
i dunno about you but i do not have records going back all the way to the first bitcoins i got. I guess you could tell them you mined a ton of bitcoins at some point but how do you prove that? if it was so far back you CPU mined for a weekend and just held? It might be easy, and they might accept it, but i wouldn't count on it. Criminals are very good at not telling the truth so they want verifiable information about the source of the asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:31:17

If the biggest the mempool ever got was 100K why did they ever bother with the 1 mb size? Seems like a wasted solution on a non existing problem. From what i recall it was in place to block spam attacks from blowing up block size cheaply.
Changing the block size is supposed to be relatively easy to do. 
I am also glad they are working on real solutions but telling people to "go use a competitor until we get our shit together" is not a valid response. You never want to suggest that your product is not able to get the job done. thats bad business. Your customers are going to start to realize that maybe they don't need your product anymore when other products seem to be able to work better at the current moment in time. Getting people back is a lot harder than loosing them.

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:17:53
i dont know if that totally makes sense to me. The blocks used to be unlimited way back when right? They put in the size restriction to help with some spam issue. So, now we are stuck with 1 mb blocks because its a bad idea to increase the block size at all ever again because some day maybe there will be layer 2. if the block size can go from infinity to 1, it can go from 1 to 2, then later back to 1 if that is what needs doing just do it. let people use the system now. Lets face it, the correct decision has a lot to do with making sure your customer base can use the system. How much of it is "we only do the best thing" and how much of it is "we don't want to do that because it might hurt what we are trying to do down the road"?

Haha, I do not take sides in this whole thing i try and watch both sides and understand each. That is why i say that i agree with segwit, i think it is needed and will be very useful. I think we do need some fee relief also. especially if its expected that layer 2 stuff is not going to hit for another 18 months. its just too long to be getting murdered in fees. I think perhaps there might be a disconnect between people trying to use bitcoin to buy stuff and people who hodl. if you buy to gain value as it raises in price fees are meaningless because you spend on fees very rarely. but a daily user to buy things is getting killed to the point they do decide to use bch or just not bother at all.

not to mention the way i hear things lately 5 dollars fee and a day later delivery is on par with how bitcoin performs, not to mention they have to take that bitcoin they got send it again to an exchange to convert it, so not only do they get the money at about the same cost as the 5 dollar fee by western union, they will probably get it approximately the same time, and they have to pay another fee to claim the cash. 
Edit: Unfortunately the fastest cheapest way to transfer a store of value is an altcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-07 13:34:36
the only way you lose coins as far as i understand it is on the other chain. so lets say you have 1 btc now, after fork you have 1 b1x and 1 b2x. if you send 1 b1x you also send 1b2x because of no replay protection. thats the coin loss everyone seems to be worried about. Its not a worry unless you are only interested in trying to sell the one fork coin for the other. otherwise you wait until the one chain fails and then you have nothing to worry about because the one chain will be the one everyone is using just like now, and the other chain will be limping along so badly its worthless and no one will care if they accidentally sent a coin somewhere with it.

Yes i am aware. But what is OK when it comes to your food? are you not eating artificial coloring? No preservatives? Did that Strawberry you just ate actually come from a line of strawberries that were selectively breed and hybridized? Is that really ok?  or were they dosed with radiation to increase mutation rates? I'll bet you wouldn't fine a convenient label on them for that process. The whole organic farming movement still uses pesticides. The whole anti gmo and eat natural movement is a little out there for my tastes.

you might consider double compressing/encrypting or getting something liek Truecrypt and making a file volume to store the file...
The issue with Rar is that you can open the archive and see the files in it, even if you cannot view contents. if someone gets a hold of the file and can see its a txt in there... then they might get curious and be more likely to try and break the password.
Truecrypt (or its replacement which i cannot think of the name of right now), creates a file that is just a blob of encrypted data. once you mount it with the truecrypt application, it acts like a USB drive. You see it in my computer as a drive letter. when you are done you dismount it store it where ever you like. Truecrypt is really solid encryption and as long as your password is masterfully crafted and you can reproduce it when you want to access the file again you are golden.
The file doesn't need any specific extensions or file names, so in my case i just named the file a bunch of random letters and numbers. no extension. If you view the file it is pretty much just garbage. But if you open it with truecrypt its 5 GBs of my documents that i keep scanned in an evernote database.
I think it lets you choose the size of the volume so you could do a simple 5 mb file maybe and just load on whatever BTC related stuff you need backed up. i mean you could probably even keep a copy of the wallet file in there if you wanted to or paper wallet private keys if you have any... 
Obviously all this needs to be done on a secure computer without key loggers or anything of the sort.

I would mostly agree here. This is a good way to do the backup offline, but i wouldn't rely on hiding methods from websites online as you can find that people may read sites like that and then come rob you. So, you also have to consider if your house burned down or something will your hiding place be destroyed? Paper burns easy. 
I recommended truecrypt in my other comment, its pretty good but you still have to put things online and thats your goal it seems but its not recommended. But you have to take some risk no matter how you do this so its up to you to decide whats more likely to be safe in your situation. I am sure you could get yourself an etching set, or look up metal etching online also, and get yourself some thin steel plates or stainless steel or whatever they recommend for the etching process and then get your seed down on some metal plates that will stand the test of time much better than paper.

you made nothing until you cash it out brotha. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:38:56
You really do have a hard time spending it easily. Unless you use a debit card that you load with bitcoin? that basically is like taking x bitcoin to the exchange and cashing it out and carrying around x bitcoin worth of dollars in your pocket around to buy stuff. If you are "spending" bitcoin you need to go to the super market and transact a bitcoin transaction in exchange for goods, or at your car repair shop for services. Until that is wide done and accepted im sorry man, you are dealing with something that is traded for cash to be useful. Most businesses using bitcoin are taking your payment in bitcoin when you send it to them and direct converting it to cash dollars in their bank account. Things are coming along and some of these stepping stones are necessary to bring it up to full adoption, but you are kidding yourself a bit if you think that its a currency at present. 
Currency: a system of money in GENERAL use in a particular country.
Currency: the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use.
Sorry friend i don't think bitcoin in its current state qualifies for general use or generally accepted. It has all the potential but you are not there yet. Go down to your local super market and grab a loaf of bread and when the cashier asks you for a dollar tell them how much bitcoin is that and what address to send it to. where will that get you?
I am on board and hope for a bright future but i am not deluding myself into thinking its more than it is. It maybe that eventually but its not today.

thats what i mean. you have not realized any gains or loss until you convert it to the base value system. Have you ever sold a house? you might value it at 200K but that doesn't mean you will sell it for that much someone might only offer 180K. Just because you have a house that people tell you is worth 200K doesn't mean you have 200K in your pocket.

It shouldn't be looked at as an investment so much as a gamble in my opinion. Similar to stock markets, you can find that your 10000 is worth 4000 in a few days. Though sometimes you get lucky and your value goes way up! It seems BTC has been on a generally upward trend over time, but you cannot guarantee that. Lots of people use bitcoin for speculation and thus the market can be very flip floppy.

Hydro Power usually, i know one of the towns near me has their own municipal water generation system and they sell to their own town at a really low rate compared to the big nuclear plant that supplies pretty much everyone else.

I think in the past this thinking was done by the merchant not the buyer. I mean you had your credit card and a % on that if you held a balance but that wasn't to hard to figure out or avoid assuming you were responsible. 
The actual transaction fee however was paid by the merchant so it was not anything the buyer was worrying about. It is something very different to sit there and think about how much extra you have to pay for your soda to make sure you can get your soda within a short time frame. There is probably not a situation where bitcoin would work very well at a brick and mortar store if the vendor is trying to get any number of confirmations on the transaction considering you will probably be waiting many minutes up to 10 to get first confirmation if you are the highest fee, and the miner isn't one of those that doesn't include any transactions or only specific types of transactions etc.

eh, consensus is a hard sell man. That thing stalled out for a long time and only made it through right before it was about to expire am i right? This wasn't a situation where "Hey we got segwit ready and we are putting it out there, everyone start upgrading" then everyone started upgrading. some people upgraded more just kinda watched. 
Lets say enough people were not in the consensus that BCH exists at about 1/6th the value right now. that's not a small thing in my book.

Bitcoin Cash is also an implementation of Bitcoin... This whole name thing is nonsense. Just because its called Bitcoin doesn't make it any better or worse than any other crypto. its just about the legacy of the name. Once people understand the services they will get from each coin the name wont matter. 
I dont care what you call them. i do believe that everyone should use the same name, and i do agree however that bitcoin.com naming bch as bitcoin is not right. But no existing branch of bitcoin as it is today is "the original bitcoin" that died ages ago when the forks started.

i have been saying it for a while the major driver for bitcoin right now is in fact people paying ransoms for ransomware. You are getting 100's of thousands of pcs infected with that stuff all the time and a portion of those practice poor network security and administrative practices having no backups, or backups so hard to restore that it makes more sense to pay the 500 dollars.  Seems ransomware has its price set just right. If i have enough data that restoring my backup takes to long, or requires extra effort, its just less friction to pay the man and get things restored in place. Process can be done in a few hours often, vs remote backups being re-downloaded, or admins coming in to assess, restore local backups which may even be a day behind thus causing data loss. Yall better hope this ransomware thing never gets solved because BTC going to crash when it does unless this bullshit with segwit and network congestion gets solved, even then you are probably going to see it drop.

@_date: 2017-05-21 15:46:35
haha. very possibly. I don't do much trading though so my only use of exchanges is converting any alts i get to BTC or fiat to btc.
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:26:47
Looking at 2016, it seems like the volume total payouts estimated was around 209 million. i would have guessed more. but that's the stat i saw, so that's only about 350 bitcoins for the year if you figure 600 dollar average price per coin. 
But i would have responded saying that i don't believe that the hackers would be converting directly to fiat. that would be risky to do. I would expect they would run through mixing systems for some number of months or years, maybe something like joinmarket. When you have a bill come due that you need money for, you would then withdraw. i don't know if these hackers would be relying on this btc to support themselves after or not. just seems like a bad plan. better to do it, hold the heist and let it mix and become more unidentifiable then use it sparingly for stuff when the need arises. So in that case you would have all these extra coins bought, and circulating in the system but not being sold back out to fiat. would make me curious to know how much transaction traffic is coinjoining efforts.
call this a conspiracy theory :). its just hard to sit here watching the price, seeing the network struggle like it is and all this infighting. how can anyone have confidence in a system that is strangling itself from the inside?
Correction the 209 million figure was for q1 so you could theoretically multiply that by 4 to round out a  year assuming the infections were not ramping up (which other charts in that article showed they were) The real question is what pushes up the price? how much do you have to buy at a regular interval... to put pressure on the supply. if it were 1400 BTC bought for the year, you look at 3.83 btc a day... the block reward easily covers that, but add that to the other regular stuff that is going on. and if ransom ware was not a think that volume would not be putting extra pressure. it has some effect you cannot say it doesn't.

as far as a paper wallet goes, it can be as easy as moving your BTC into an electrum wallet (or any wallet that gives you a word seed), and then write down that phrase many times, then test recovery of that phrase a few times over the next few days or weeks and when you are comfortable you can delete the wallet from your computer.

maybe for wannacry the amount being paid is low, but for many of the others i don't know how you would even track the addresses since each new infection has its own payment address. This wannacry stuff is something different than the typical cryto ransomware we have been seeing up to this point so i don't think it really applies. But you have not read the news articles about hospitals and other big businesses stockpiling bitcoin to pay off ransomware if they get hit? I work in IT, i have seen companies hit with it and the described logic is how they all played out. Certainly its not the best way to deal with it because it just makes it a successful endeavor and encourages more cryptoware.

I think  most big blockers feel that cost of storage will remain low through technology advancements and that everyone will be able to afford to host a node if they really want to. But i think the number of people that are going to want to be even bothered with such a thing as hosting a node is going to be a small fraction of the population. Like how people use Gmail over hosting their own email with a simple service like godaddy. its not hard to do, but why bother when it's easier to just let someone else worry about it.

Just gotta split your private keys between the two wallet types and then send the BCC or BTC to an exchange that can sell one for the other and then move it back out. not hard to do i don't think. i guess you risk loosing out if you make the wrong choice and one of the two sides tanks and you are on the wrong side.

Why should they not be? The only reason i can think of for them not to be is to try and funnel activity into the 2nd layer. Why should I be forced to suffer slow and expensive transactions just because i don't want to transact in the 2nd layer? I think this is why most big blocker types are a little concerned. You should not have to force traffic into the 2nd layer by making it to expensive to use anything else. Traffic should go that way because its a benefit in some way other than pure cost and speed. Features like privacy, or recurring payments, perhaps betting, or contracts. Instant transactions are a feature here where obviously on-chain cannot compete with that, but many of us have an expectation that we should be able to send an on-chain transaction for a small fee and have it confirmed on network within an hour i would think.

which at that moment was decided by one person. which is not a market value. thats an individuals value. he could have sold them for a dollar, would that make the market value 1 dollar? No, His value of them is 1 dollar. after they are all "sold" the value comes back up to what the market value is for them, which would likely be more than 1 dollar. 
If a person has a large supply of BTC that they do not value, and they want to manipulate the market they might do something annoying like, write a bot that auto sells any time the price reaches a value of say 600 dollars, and to sell off his specific amount at say 200 dollars per unit. Effectively speaking doing this, until he runs out of coins and cannot obtain more, is market manipulation is it not?  One individual imposes their will on the market. Now suppose someone starts to do this after some big event, or in response to an event. Maybe an investment event. Value of the coins is 600, and tons of coins are donated to a fund that will be used to build a wall around nyc to keep the honking sounds from bothering the rest of the state. This bot goes into action right after the donations. the value of that fund is now manipulated down to 200 dollars a unit which is 1/3rd the original value, and now the fund cannot pay for the project because the value is ripped out from under it. If, more funds are donated and they get to a point where they have enough and the bot goes again to reduce the value to 100, the project is blocked again. that's manipulation. Market manipulation is a thing. 
"Market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a security, commodity or currency."

In bitcoins current state sure that may not be a big deal, but if it were more of a backbone to society which everyone seems to want, that would be a huge problem. Disrupting global economy for even a partial day would be  problematic, and i doubt that a solution would be found within 24 hours. It would take time for new hardware to come online. Your fastest option would be developers somehow blocking the attacking miners, but how would they isolate them?
I am not a big fan of developers tampering with the system in that way. The system would need to auto correct. Also, assuming the 70% drops off and enough time goes by that the difficulty goes down, then the 70% powers back up, blocks would be found much faster than 10 minutes no? That would give the attacker a decent good advantage to maybe fork the blockchain to their advantage. 
Why anyone would want to do it other than to be a tool i don't know, esp as you say, you have to spend quite a bit of money to do it, but it maybe worth it to some organizations. Maybe they pool funds so its less on one group and spreads the cost out to all their mutual benefit.

@_date: 2017-06-21 19:00:43
yea well that is fine, but how do you benefit from this? if you have to make a new channel each time you pay someone why are we not just using on chain transactions? i assume the vendors have a channel that others can send funds into... but again its a little unclear but i have not read deeply on it either. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:27:56
kinda like going into the future to get lottery numbers and then coming back to buy that ticket. only you go back in time pre-mine up a ton of bitcoins that you know will be all over the place in the future. Nice.

The reputation for these things needs to be negative more so than just "well we got encrypted but we were able to buy our way out of it" it needs to be, we got encrypted and we lost it all. we were screwed. Then people will take security and backup policies more seriously don't you think?

I saw a demo of lightning network and i guess i dont fully grasp how its supposed to work for the channels to allow micropayments.
The demo showed that you fund the channel with a block of money you wish to be able to spend on the channel. then you send it, close the channel. you get back whats left over from the block minus a fee i guess. but how does that save anything for anyone? it only seems good if you leave it open indefinitely for something like buying coffee every morning on your way to work. Is it possible for a channel to be opened by the vendor, and you just join and contribute what you need to each time? I feel like i am missing something important here.

In my personal uneducated simpletons opinion, its good that the big holders of early sell out now while things are still wild. when things get higher and even more valuable you will probably want more stability so whales selling out then will be really annoying. But that, as i said is just an uneducated simpletons opinion. :)

I don't talk to many ppl about it that already don't know about it, but the one person i did talk to asked the same question.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:39:56
Yes you get 2 kinds. Think of it kinda like this.
You have a computer with a word document on it. every day you open the document and type a word. you do this without fail every 10 minutes every day. Now, you have a co worker who wants to write to your document also but doesnt agree on the words to be typed. He takes a copy of your word document and opens it and starts typing words. you both do this on your copy of the file. all the data before he took the copy is the same. so if you have a private key (which would effectively point to a letter in a word) that is from before he took his copy, your key would reference the same letter in both files. Figure he changed the name of his document from yours. if yours was called btc, and he named his ctb, your private key would give you letters in both btc and ctb.
This is probably a lame explanation but it vaguely gives you an idea of what is happening.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:46:42
So it's just a dual currency wallet? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 11:53:26
Well, i guess we would have to see how much drops out. If 70% of mining power drops out, and then the mining rigs are liquidated...a wealthy attacker(s), could buy them up at a bargain price... fire them all up and then have 70% of the hashing power right?
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:04:07
Stuck transactions just sit there until they expire or confirm. They have a lifetime. the thing that some people forget is that your wallet software will also remember the transaction and rebroadcast it if it doesnt see it in the mempool, so if you run a wallet software that does this then it will stay in the mempool until it is finally confirmed. To get it out of mempool you have to find out how to get your wallet software to stop rebroadcasting it then wait for it to expire out of mempool then you can try again with higher fees or send it somewhere else. 
as for where to keep the altcoins im sure there are some hardware wallets that can handle some of  them it all depends on what you are trying to hold onto.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:08:41
huh interesting. Thanks ill check it out!
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:44:07
The easiest is probably to continue using coinbase. you will have transaction fees in btc to move the coins back to coinbase from your offline wallet, and then you will have fees again when you convert back to fiat at coinbase. If you plan to buy and sell frequently it may make more sense to keep the bitcoins at coinbase to save on transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:17:56
i would think that backing out at the last minute again would effectively bankrupt bitcoin. It will probably be enough for most to sell out who have any idea whats going on. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:49:05
Yea but if i did do that then it would never have taken off.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:33:45
so what it wont stay there for long. let me know when it sits there for a day.
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:46:25
depends on a lot of factors and i don't really keep track of that type of thing so i'm not really sure honestly. I don't know who could give you a reliable number. Its hard to know what anyone in this world is going to do.

Yup, Whats the difference between tossing a paper Key in the safe in the basement vs writing down the seed and keeping that in a safe somewhere or worse your file folder under your desk or in your closet? WHen i get my first full bitcoin, i am thinking to transfer it to a paper wallet key and pin it to my wall as if it were "my first dollar" like they do with new businesses. Public key only of course :)
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:40:33
I think you have to double it or your btc will be stuck on the moon where you cannot get at them.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:33:36
Do i have to have a point? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:10:57
I honestly dont use a hardware wallet, but as long as you can get at private keys if you have to you should be fine. If there is a chain split likely one will die out,but if they both go on and one just lags behind you could theoretically sell the coin you dont want to use and buy into more of the coin you do want to use. You need to have your private keys to do that. if you leave your coins in coinbase they will probably be safe and all but you might not get the split coins if they decide not to support it. With ETH when it split into ETH and ETC, they did allow people to withdraw their ETC if they wanted to then eventually they stopped supporting it. but there are no guarantee they will do it again.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:14:23
Yea, that would be difficult. you would need your wallet software to assign a value to every private key when it gets funds, and some how redirect additional funds after the first batch to a different key thats new, so you can continue to do the same thing. then when you spend from the account, you could get the new value and if its more than what the value was when you got them, add in some extra to cover the tax and send it to a tax escrow address or something like that. it could be automated...
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:02:04
you should move the coins to a local wallet on your computer that you can export the private keys from. that is the safest thing to do. just make sure you look up bitcoin wallet security best practices prior to doing it so you make sure to keep them safe.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:56:09
if you mean you keep your btc on blockchain.info with their web wallet, i would just move it all back into coinbase and keep it there. you are using a web wallet either way. The only reason i would move out of the coinbase wallet is if you are planning to keep the coins for a long time, or wish to actively use them for other reasons than just trading back and forth.

Maybe It is where i live i don't know but i show up about an hour before my flight most times and easily get through it all and sit at the gate waiting for entry of the aircraft. There has never been a huge line for me, and I answer questions honest and quickly and i do not hassle them. I have been randomly selected for bag screenings and such before and they all have gone quick and efficiently. I am very comfortable with the process and its never given me any grief yet. 
It was more concerning coming back from italy where i just had to walk through a metal detector and send my bags down the conveyor to get on the plane.

@_date: 2017-06-27 17:19:44
That is kinda what i was thinking about initially. just a paper framed "first dollar" type thing like businesses do when they make their first sale. but thinking about it more, it might be worth while to buy a cheap tablet for 30-50 bucks and just install a wallet app on it that displays current balance and info. If you could get something that looked nice as a widget you could just put it as the only homescreen widget and throw on a nice background and it would boot up to the display and that would be really nice i think. only problem is you have to leave it plugged in all the time.

Securing your wallet funds with a 4 digit pin isn't exactly secure.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:30:25
What am i losing?  If the value is converted from btc to usd before it even gets to the merchant there is little value in using BTC like this unless you have some really cheap supply of BTC you tap regularly. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:35:34
No? If i have 1 million bitcoins i cannot drop the value by mass selling? If i have 1 million fiat i cannot raise the value by mass buying? I couldn't collude with others to some effect? I think it would be possible.  I cannot claim to know what the benefits would be to doing that, but I remember when that whale sold off and equalized the value to about 300 dollars a year or two ago.

If the incentive is to be able to still transact on the network after the switch you can believe someone will get on upgrading.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:32:43
So, this wallet is a bitcoin wallet that sends your bitcoins in exchange for stratis tokens, then the get converted back to bitcoins at the destination address you specified? Similar to how people might use changely or something like that for?

What most of the extremists seem to miss is that you have to meet in the middle. you can have both. you can have lightning network, and you can have bigger blocks. You need both sides to be flexible so that you can give the users the option to operate how they want to operate. If you lock in 1 mb blocks for ever you effectively force people into lightning network or whatever solutions come about. If you only expand blocks then you run the risk of hardware costs being to great for node operators. Truly they should get segwit in place and open up the block size and let the market decide how it wants the system to look. if people are happy using segwit and lightning network, then block sizes will remain reasonably small. if not then block sizes will grow and you will find that you need to deal with that problem. If lightning network is adequate for enough people then you should find that the whole thing finds a sweet spot and balances out.

with any exchange you risk them loosing your money. Its like you are giving 100 dollars to your friend and his house burns down and its gone, or he just decides to forget you gave it to him and keeps it. Most provide a service and thus want to have a good reputation so they wont knowingly ruin your day, but they do ruin your day unintentionally with hackers, or schemes. Coinbase is pretty solid in general in my opinion in terms of not intentionally screwing you over, though with anything on the internet you will read about coinbase horror stories. 
With any crypto you also risk the loss or theft of your coins when handling the private keys so be careful if you do that. they always recommend extreme paranoia when doing so.

Mt. Gox if i recall wasn't really a company built around bitcoin as a business either. IT was a Magic the Gathering Online Exchange hence the name mtgox. Seems like you are trying to compare a lemonade stand to a smoothie kiosk in the mall. Banks do the same thing. they lock away the majority of their money and leave enough in the quick access reserves to allow daily business. if you have a TON of money in the bank and try to withdraw it all at once you wont be able to. you will have to wait for them to fetch it. If you were crazy enough to hold a huge amount of btc with coinbase you might need to do the same.
