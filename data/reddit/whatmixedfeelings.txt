Why do you criticize “old men” as a group? Why do you believe millennials are automatically more informed?

Will this be "fixed" by Coinbase? They must be losing a lot in potential fees because of this.

Any pictures from *during* the event?

It won't be an overnight switch to crypto, it will be a slow market collapse where the dollar becomes worthless and those who switch to crypto *first* make it out on top. This will be the ultimate bull market for crypto, as everyone switches from fiat to cut their losses.

But Bitcoin can't always be in it's infancy stage. It has grown, it has matured, it has made a lot of us wealthy. Not *me,* but some of you other lucky folks who had the stamina to hodl all this time.

They probably didn't even do the math. They just thought, "Hell, 500% sounds like a lot and our ignorant readers won't know the difference."
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:52:55
They're one in the same. Kraken lists BTC as XBT, also. 
Edit: I'm not sure why so many redditors have had problems with Coinbase. I've only had one encounter with their team and it was because they caught me sending bitcoin to a gambling site (NOT RECOMMENDED).

Used to work there, can confirm. Suggested crypto to a couple of my loyal customers and they thanked me ever since.

This some gaudy shit

Precisely this.  I’ve tried making this point to a lot of people who just don’t seem to get it. “Backed by the full faith and credit of the US government” doesn’t mean shit if it’s 20T in debt and a financial collapse crumbles ALL major banks. USD won’t be worth anything at that point. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:24:55
Totally agree and to clarify, I didn’t say liquidating into crypto was the *sane* option, just that I can imagine a lot of people choosing that option out of desperation.  Personally I keep a cache of survival items to last a month, minimum, without electricity or running water.  As it stands now, crypto should be a backup investment; money you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:19:49


I disagree. I think power and communication lines would continue to exist, even if temporarily. Societal collapse doesn’t happen overnight.  I imagine a lot of people would begin dumping USD for cryptocurrency as the economy spirals, hoping to secure at least partial value of their life savings.  This is where crypto becomes useful as a store of value, rather than payment processing. 
If the power eventually goes out for an extended period of time, say more than a month, then I suppose bartering would occur with goods and services until it comes back online. Bitcoin would continue to exist globally until economy comes back, however long that would take.

Yeah. I was a bank teller in college and we had several irate customers because we wouldn’t give more than 10k unless they called ahead. It’s because the branch tries to keep its vault balance low, in case of a robbery.

You clearly haven't read the original HODL thread. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:25:19
Haha, exactly. I tried my luck, ended up losing money because i get too emotional when things don't go my way. Thus, a hodler was born.

Haha I actually got my mom to invest when it was $630. She's loving the gains. Although when I suggested she get into Ethereum, she was like "nah thats just a ripoff, bitcoin's the real deal."
Oh well, I'mma do both :p
