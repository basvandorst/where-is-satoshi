Bravo. Very good to see this carefully laid out

Not all banks are running against the same implementation schedule - some countries will ratify components of the accord earlier than others. This could create a healthy competition between banks on certain product differentiation, such as (possibly) utilising bitcoin for transfers - if they're going to lose that product base to market efficiency, they will surely attempt to package it and make it a service offering. A loss- leader if you will. 
Nice that someone's brought complex but relevant banking concepts into discussion here. Please keep it up.

can you create a view on this data that shows significant sales transactions of say 100BTC+ from any of the Top 500 wallets? Could be a simple 'early warning system' to the community for substantial exits in the market. Cheers

Thanks OP, this is an area of great interest

if explicit intention is declared (regulation), allowing another friendly nation to gain advantage - expect that affected BTC holders in the announced regulated region will sell, invoking a correction, then a rally as BTC finds its true value.
if tacit support is declared ("we'll do something, anything to stop it falling into another friendly nations hands"), expect a buying rally to true value.
if 'wait and see' is adopted, (effectively a tacit support), expect BTC will continue to rally in value.
What other eventualities are there?

to your point, and in advance of the CSD are you increasing your BTC investments this weekend?

Why stop at $1,000,000? Surely your maths provides for even higher levels of growth? maybe $1,000,000,000? Or even a quadrillion. Maybe a trillion quadrillion. Or maybe the maths is quite precise, and there is a really critical fundamental that I missed.

Yes, I’m interested to encourage more people to own and hold BTC for longer term - especially people who are just coming into contact with bitcoin for the first time, that might otherwise get too distracted by mining (a very distinct activity in its own right) and the wider portfolio of components we all work with. 
I’m even thinking of actually giving some mBTC away, and holding them on behalf of some new users, to really give an insight into the considerable value in holding long, and seeing past the market heat, towards the bigger potential of the BTC protocol and infrastructure.

that guy from ZipZap is a blow hard - he maintained he got a standing ovation for mentioning it. Many of us were standing. There wasn't much room. We clapped a bit.

Will be interesting to learn the outcome of the Third Plenum taking place in BJ right now. This is a fascinating announcement

I mean, the subject matter and general news on dealings (and the subsequent impact on market rates)

quite unsophisticated insights from senator

they have to establish the 'market overview/history' first
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:22:50
actually, they are carefully setting out criminality from the positive capabilities of virtual currencies - they will leave Liberty Reserve and criminality entangled, and BTC/coins will be separated out and supported

OP, hear hear
