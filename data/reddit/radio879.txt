your right it could be just code from electrum, but the files (were, i reformatted) were all over the place. My wallet file was in some folder on the root of the drive but there were so many changes I lost track....
Weird things started happening like porn sites like it would say "tom's porn collection" and be an empty folder (i don't watch porn on the computer) but it made it seem like it was going to do something bad with it so i recovered my wallet with another linux install and ended up sending it far away for now.
I just copied random files that had changed before i deleted the whole thing. The electrum folder on an old linux install was as it should be - the wallet.dat file was in its normal place.

its the default firewall of linux mint, i specifically did not fuck with any of it (as i like to do) i'll have a extra linux for tinkering. But i read that Mint/Ubuntu accidently left VNC on all the time, i'm assuming with default passwords. That's on them , not me.

i know i know have you ever been so fucking busy you skip over things you wanna do? i've been busy, that's all. I did encrypt the wallet and (if) they were going after it they couldn't get past my password.

preaching to the choir man like the rest of you, and it was only like a hundred bucks :)  i was going to use it and got distracted. wallet.dat is usually a temporary spot

I've been out of the loop i'm no stranger to bitcoin. If i would not have sold out, i'd be sitting pretty on a beach right now.
But of course i'm not and that is how life goes..for YOU (me in - anyway)
I'm a big poponent and i havebeen known to get in some arguments over it,i havebeen known to not take my own advice..
I don't know how more advanced cryptocurrency is going to do, but bitcoin being the FIRST real cryptocurrency, i don't see it going away and in is it 2021 the coins are going to run out? which means the price is just going to keep going up over a long period of time.
Anyway off topic. I'm no newb to php whoever sent that other PM, and there is something familiarabout what was written and i quickly skimmed thru (sorry  no time tonight)

We are looking to implement bitcoin at flymode.com - we are wondering if its worth adding to the new sites which will be a total upgrade. We have a stockpile of new condition Vintage clothes/shoes/etc (a LOT of it). I've been a bitcoin enthusiast since 2011 but been away for a while. I'm the only bitcoin guy in the office I would love to convince the boss to let me implement it. 
If you see anything on the site (we are going to upgrade the entire site soon) you want to buy, you can send me BTC and I will ship you the item personally)
Bitcoin address:
email tom 
Show me some love bitcoiners. Let me know if you think its worth adding as a checkout option on the new site. I think it is, but I love bitcoin. What do you think? Flymode.com and vintagedetroitclothing.com

I came here after (generally) being out of the bitcoin scene for a few years (was bummed when I heard it hit $1000, knowing I had 50BTC at one time) to see if its worth adding to website checkouts. 
Doesn't look good. Looks like if i showed this to anyone (this subreddit) they'd be like uh yeah lets just skip bitcoin.

Came here to check out the bitcoin scene after being away for a few years. My god. Need to get a 4 year degree specifically on bitcoin just to grasp whats going on.

Ahhh 2011. I burned out my crappy video card but was able to mine 3BTC on one of those networks. I had 50BTC in my wallet. I "borrowed" from a guy who disappeared off the internet. Was like 100 bucks worth at the time. Was supposed to pay him the $100 he disappeared.
I ended up selling them.. for like $200 or something. I don't remember. But I remember being bummed hearing about it jumping up to $1000/BTC.
One time years ago, I bought $1000 of Intel stock, and 3 days later, it crashed down to being worth like 1/5th (early 00's). I was broke years later ended up selling it for like $350.
Seems like its related to karma conspiracies or something.
