I'm not sure but I would keep transaction rates between once a week and once a month. Preferred once a month. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:56:23
 why's he going backwards?

Some mining pools, especially Bitcoin mining pools offer custom withdraw rates.  In order to minimize the impact of transaction fees, dont withdraw frequently.  By doing this, you should be fine to mine to your ledger.  The issue with mining to your HW wallet is due to microtransactions.  These need to be compiled into a larger sum when outgoing, which is too much work for the tiny device.  I had to deal with this for Vertcoin and Ledger Nano S.  In order to move them, i ended up having to move them in 10VTC bunches at a time.  This took a while, but now im able to move them all at once.  Now i mine to a legit wallet, and then move to the HW wallet afterwards.

Lol! I thought the same thing. Should say, "...for bitcoin" not with bitcoin as if the buyer will receive bitcoin along with the building. 
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:41:06
Yeah, I knew this was complicated and this just multiplied the complexity x10.  Think about token transfers back and forth between exchanges, finally into your wallet using eth to pay for transactions sometimes and the exchange pulling tokens to pay for fees other times. What a mess.

Is it just me, or was Roger Ver putting out a lot of misinformation and claiming them as fact?
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:07:34
If you are actually trying to make a point, re-read my comment and try and understand what I'm saying. In addition, think about how many laws are being enacted that are not voted on.  Democracy is becoming more of an illusion that people lean on. I understand what you're saying, and yes breaking into my home would be breaking **A** law that has value to society. Not all laws serve a purpose to better society, and instead to further provide power to those who already have it. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:55:57
You missed the point, but taking you're dookie on my lawn would be rather disgusting and serve no purpose when I could have let you into my home and used a proper toilet. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:42:25
I think that's the point John is making. If in your country, the law said you were not allowed to chew gum, would you then take responsibility and accept your punishment? Point is there are many laws and in this case he does not agree that what he may or may not have done was wrong. The gum chewing example comes from Singapore. 
Laws are a tool to force compliance. And people will call for justice from those who seek to go against "the law"
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:51:07
Nice break down. I wasn't out of arguments, just wasn't interested in getting into it.
My initial comment was just saying that the point being made is likely the same as Johns point. He doesn't agree with the law as it's being interpreted by those who are after him and so does not feel compelled to surrender. Im not defending his actions. Only saying that the point being made in the first comment I replied to is likely the same.  That's all. 
Anarchy is not the solution, I can agree to that.

Or people should do their own research and realize buying the coins will be more efficient.

Im impressed with the diversity of that crowd. Crypto supporters really come from all walks of life. Incredible and honored to have the opportunity to participate. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:07:15
You've done a much better job at explaining it. :)

Buying $1k of btc when its $3k, or buying when its $1k, would be about $66k difference if btc hits $100k.  So yeah, it matters. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:51:39
Sell if you need the money. If you dont, continue to hold and maybe buy some more below $6k, if it falls below. You never know what is going to happen.
Obviously, you make your own decisions and will have to live with them when you do. At the current price, its risky to sell with the intention to buy lower. The low before was $3.2k. If we are going to rise, we're getting close to a bottom.

WTF? A few $$ I'm thinking $20, maybe a few hundred.  Student expect a few thousand. Apparently I'm poor. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:02:47
I'll share what I've said before to someone else asking the same question. Basically no one knows what's going to happen. Buy where you feel comfortable in the amount you are comfortable losing if we never see a rise. Otherwise HODL on mah dude.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:57:03
Or, you know, don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Be smart.

Um...having ties to Bitcoin doesn't mean being bullish. He's taken the time to comment about Bitcoin publicly many times, so as far as a rudimentary algorithm is concerned Buffett is a CEO and he talks about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:14:02
Anytime friend. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:59:40
Google just took keywords and found CEOs with ties to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:51:00
I prefer BitDoge
@_date: 2019-08-15 22:41:09
Absolutely. It is a scam.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:48:08
What's worse is that it is thanks to bitcoins transparent ledger they were even able to identify and capture anyone associated with this site. If anything although it was their preferred method of payment, it was ultimately their downfall.

Do you have a how to on this complete setup? Including the lottery mining setup. Thanks.

Email addresses can be spoofed. That's not a good indicator. This is clearly a scam.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:23:31
Wow.  The fact any were returned is super impressive. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:34:34
What if funds are permanently locked into the contract until both parties agree to release funds. If neither party agrees, the funds are burned after a time period. Essentially penalizing both parties. This would be a solution as people would be less likely to defraud each other. Unless we end up with trolls purposely causing people to inadvertently burn their coins. Shit...
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:51:48
This is more like, what's it's like to try to buy a compete bitcoin, portions ast a time. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:47:58
Make seller only need a smaller percentage payment hold. For example, 1BTC from buyer, and 0.1BTC from seller, so it's not the only buyer at a loss. Yes seller can lose the product but the equivalent value is lost to the buyer. I think there is some possibility here, but still needs some sort of point system tied to wallets to block frequent abusers. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:09:37
It's because 700 sounds better than 8

I sent some bitcoin at 1 sat/byte. I also got a double spend warning.  30 minutes later it had one confirmation and warning went away.

Lol! I do the exact thing for signing up at sites as well. I have a compiled list of companies that have done the same with my email. From big names to small names, then all sell your info to outside companies that don't care and probably resell the info again. Everything from Viagra to kindly informing me that I've won a gift certificate. Just fill out a form for delivery.

I've never been able to solve a rubiks cube...ever....in my life.  I couldn't even reassemble it right when i tried to cheat by taking it apart.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:08:11
Are there any good places, similar to Craigslist, that one can sell stuff for Bitcoin?  I have been looking and the services I found have so many rules and policies that make selling for Bitcoin more hassle than it should be.

How'd you know?! Was it the big Fry's Electronics sign in the background advertising their delivery service? 
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:53:32
Exactly. Gold is used in large quantities in various forms. Electronics being a huge parts of it. In the future this demand will increase exponentially. Golds value is secure long term, more than trinkets.

I mean, say your house is on fire and you throw a can of gasoline in. Sure, you've accelerated things, but the house was still on fire. Gas or not, it was going to burn.

I was imagining Thor rambling on and on about bitcoin, and Loki was Roger Ver chained up in the corner trying to talk about bcash.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:27:56
I had a guy tell me about how he was able to create fake bitcoin that could get 2 confirmations before being determined to be a double spend or fake. I'm not sure how it works, but apparently there are ways to fool the system for a few minutes.
