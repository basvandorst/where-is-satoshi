I just went through and read Sec. 5316, and the definitions, you can find it here and apply the amendments at your leisure: 
This says nothing about criminalizing bitcoin or that bitcoin is a criminal currency, it says that if you move any digitial currency from one country to the US, or from the US to one country and the value of that digital currency is over 10,000 USD you need to file a report that you sent the money. 
It *is* sensationalist, because when you read this:


It gives the sense they are actively promoting digital currencies as suspicious which is clearly not the case. If you send 10,000 USD randomly to Morocco, any bank would consider that suspicious and call you to verify details, even if they don't call you they still report it silently, even if you send money to Hong Kong or the UK. Hell my bank called me when I wanted to pay the down payment for my car, it was less than 5,000 USD. This is overreacting on another level.


I know a lot of people here have an anarcho-capitalist hard-on, but come on, lawmakers are not supervillains sitting in their evil lairs twirling their mustaches at the plight of the common man

They work for the banks? So legally if I looked at their work history, their present occupation would be what? Branch specialist? Teller?
One day you will understand the world is not big, bad, meanie adults vs you.

What does lobbying have to do with the legal text that is right there in the bill? I don't care what you or some sensationlist perceives the bill to be, and neither does the law, the only thing that matters is what is written and what is written is nothing to be fretting over.
Simple as that.
