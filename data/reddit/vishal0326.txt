@_date: 2018-08-14 07:44:28

Will BTC ever go over $20k price mark??
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:55:44
and do you think they can do it ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:31:21
No you can not there are so many countries against crypto currency and a  big country like India as well. crypto still need time to get accepted worldwide.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:54:03
That's really harsh 
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:46:43
And bitcoin can not solve these problem and may be the government doesnt feel like its important to bring crypto currency in play 
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:53:37
What make you think that ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:59:59
Are we entering into the future ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:14:24
Any facts to support your point ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:31:21
After this news I think America got a new task to do.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:50:16
It need to have some kind of regulatory authority atleast if no government or officials are included . Government work for us . Mind that dude 
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:26:43

@_date: 2018-07-30 06:22:07
Is this going to stop somewhere or not?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:15:37
If i have to say according to market condition then it will but takes time . According to you by which year it should be over that price marks of $20k??
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:44:56
ok, that was very informative . 
Thank you so much. Every system in its early stages is like that. Do you Believe it will bring any change in the model?
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:32:56
we should respect other coins as well. There was the time when bitcoin was as low as those coins ."just saying"

 The sentencing of Ross Ulbricht sets a great precedent in that government may find the desire for privacy akin with an intent to commit crimes. During the trial, the prosecutors argued exactly that point. If courts rely upon this precedent, it could lead to the swift and large-scale erosion of liberty. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:18:27
WOW , glad after knowing all these , Thank u so much 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:15:18
LOL. No. You can not wash your hands with water because its wet.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:45:10

something new in town.
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:55:13
How much time does it take to complete that transaction?
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:06:39
I think its fake.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:14:30
but this shows they are promoting bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:28:40
Is the situation going to stay the same way?
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:33:00
Whats that ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:11:52
Are they promoting something indirectly?
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:26:50
what do you mean by world first currency ??
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:13:40
only a risk taker have the courage to invest in bitcoin. Its not for weak heart people.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:13:33
There has to be some places in the country which reminds you about your history, what so bad in it ?
Secondly, They are among the top economies of the world. Are you serious ??
And is it necessary that if they have over 30% or 40% people holding crypto then only they are moving forward ? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:38:38
Thats why i have a doubt on its future. If people tend to use it even after all those restrictions then government have to go more strict which make bitcoin more questionable. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:56:46
Its good that you know that your mind is fooling you but you also know that it cant fool you.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:51:46
how much time will it take to get implemented? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 07:03:07
crazy people doing crazy stuff just for publicity
