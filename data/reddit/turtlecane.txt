I gave coinbase over $100,000 of business, and one day they suddenly reversed all my purchases and banned me cause I'm running a business. 
Incredibly fucking stupid policy, it will be their downfall. The people in charge of Coinbase are no different than the bankers who have destroyed financial freedom in America. They try and prevent anyone else from being successful so that they can dominate the market.

Transactions up over 70% in the past year on average, get the cheese out of your eyes and look at the damn chart man.

Eat shit and diaf coinbase nazi
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:50:00
Regardless, transaction volume is up 70% on average this year and we are at record numbers of transactions. Thanks for letting me know some of the transactions were a stress test. It is evident that legit transactions far exceed the stress test transactions tho.

Welcome to the club. I got charged back roughly $5000 when I was a new trader and used PayPal. I disconnected my bank immediately and 'only' lost $2000 fortunately. 
Only way to sell BTC is via vanilla reload, moneypak, western union, moneygram, and cash. 
I wrote this article after my experiences with paypal:  
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:24:03
Yeah, cause the bitcoin foundation has nothing to do with bitcoin's future. It's just a way for some wealthy people to get richer and pretend they have power.
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:33:44
That's a BS service... unless they have 51% of the hash rate it wouldn't work. 
Also, a service offering 51% attacks is kinda bad.
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:41:13
It just feels like an accomplishment. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:49:00
Lol, your posts reek of paranoia and ignorance. Doge Coin is not a scam, clearly you don't understand the definition. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:38:30
Doge Coin is certainly not a scam, a clone maybe. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:27:31
Yup, the last 2 paragraphs cover how if you keep betting you will definitely lose, just a matter of when.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:36:10
I created almost all of that through mining, and I've only been doing this less than a couple weeks. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 14:01:00
It pretty much means I've bought/received 100 Bitcoin, cause I sell all my Bitcoin everyday
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:02:24
Thanks for the welcome guys! I'm completely re-adjusting my trading strategy from trying to maximize DOGE to maximizing Bitcoin earnings. 
It's no fun to watch your holdings go down 20-30% in an alt coin while the Bitcoin market is steady/slowly strengthening. It only makes sense to hold mostly Bitcoin, while doing some day trading with the alt coins for profit (mostly since I'm a scrypt miner).
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:36:42
I'm 99% sure that the accredited investor issue wouldn't have been raised if they weren't flagged for bitcoin investments. Just look at how the Texas SEC statement begins.
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:02:45
It probably isn't good for Bitcoin with the way governments slant things, but any investment is subject to the laws of the government. If a company commits security fraud there are big penalties, they would be enforced whether it's bitcoin or fiat at stake.
Other than that I agree with you.
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:54:51
Same idea as a 51% attack, albeit for a different purpose than double spending. I'd be shocked if they've even undone 1 transaction successfully. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:50:53
Maybe that's where the stolen Bitcoins ended up.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:08:33
Thanks for the advice! I'll look into BTC-e, already have a Bitstamp account.
Under what conditions do you usually buy, and what are the conditions when you sell?

It's real, I saw his IPO on bitcointalk when it was happening, and he posted a thread today admitting all of this (about a month after the IPO ended). He is known to have gambling and drug problems and people were trying to warn others to steer clear, but some people invested.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:48:33
I disagree. The money supply is the total number of Bitcoins, which is 12+ million right now.
The market cap is just a way of looking at the value of all the Bitcoins relative to USD.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:00:34
Good advice, I'm planning on only putting $100 aside and seeing what I can do with that, as a test of sorts.
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:04:39
Yup, I discussed trading for profits in the article. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:23:06
Very good point, thank you. Signing up for BTC-e asap.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:56:44
But how does that make Doge Coin a scam? You're going all over the place with your arguments. We get it, you hate Doge Coin. Thank you for spewing your hate

You can martingale as much as you want, but with the odds against you you're guaranteed to lose.

Thanks! This significantly increases my Bitcoin holdings :P
@_date: 2014-06-07 09:32:31
Hahaha, thanks for catching that. I fixed it. Must be a Freudian slip of some sort, cause ultimately it was a donation to this guy having a party for a month.
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:04:40
Accounts were being hacked left and right before this hack happened. I don't take their word for anything. 
I did lots of deals on localbitcoins, but never used the escrow since this stuff started happening.
@_date: 2014-05-09 10:20:57
The main problem is the dev of Shibe Coin instamined 10% of all coins before launch, without telling anyone, and then he lied about it.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:33:48
I see your point, but market cap is a well known term that easily illustrates the total amount of money involved with Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies. 
There is this website afterall, and I've never seen people complain about it: 
Are you sure you can refer to money supply in different units? I didn't think so. You could say the money supply is equal to $, euros, etc., but the formal money supply is the total amount of currency for that country in their native denomination. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:48:07
BitPay did give themselves a $160 million valuation, they control the firm that is in charge of the fundraising. 
How is this early stage? BitPay is not a brand new company.
It is easily 50-100 times overpriced given the valuation quoted. It's going to probably lose investors money even if they do well.
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:31:41
Indeed, the government is scared that they will lose control of currency if Bitcoin becomes huge.
They've shut down every push that Bitcoin has made into the main stream economy.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:21:33
Just did my first trade on Coinbase, bought 0.05 Bitcoin at $667/Bitcoin. :)
Lots of buying pressure hitting the market as this little dip bottoms out so it seems like this would a good moment to do that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:00:10
Coinbase has instant buy, so there's no delay really. 
I believe the fee is 1% per trade, and the withdraw fee is as low as possible, unlike some other places which rip you off at every step. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:29:00
Thanks for the BTC-e tip guys, fees look alot lower, 0.2-0.5%. Definitely trading there!
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:12:49
Yeah, there are a couple links to the bitcointalk threads in the article.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:06:33
I'm day trading with BTC versus DOGE already with some moderate success. That market has regular cycles which are easy to manipulate. 
I want to do some BTC versus USD trading too, some huge cycles in that all throughout BTC history. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:07:53
It will show up on the blockchain for at least a day though.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:15:51
It was $56, now it's $60 :)
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:27:22
100 BTC lifetime, not all at once :P
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:45:16
I consider all the price spikes + price crashes volatility. See the graph. It's a day trader's paradise and worst nightmare.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:44:16
And now it's $70, ridiculous! I bought a little more a couple days ago and it just arrived, so $85 in Bitcoin.
$85 today, eventually $10,000+
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:14:30
That's all covered in the article, this was an overview of what it is and what the outcome is. It's obviously just as dangerous as using any other technique in dice. 
I personally like the 33% martingale. In the simulation it went from 10,000 to 320,000 dogecoins when using an initial bet of 0.01, before going bust. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:36:43
I think coinbase is an excellent place to purchase BTC to avoid huge wire fees, and BTC-e is an awesome place to trade. Glad I'm using both.
Good advice so far in this thread :)

Yup, I talked about this towards the end of my article 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:22:29
And fees were 1.4% with the trading fee + the bank fee.... not bad.

Lightning is run by a centralized company! That is a fact. Banks do not need anyone’s approval to make their own Lightning-Esque network, and that would divert transactions and income away from the miners

Can you store a hash of the data on the blockchain without making all those addresses? This was just a rudimentary test with cryptograffiti and paystamper.
It's certainly not a waste, I'm trying to develop a de-centralized scientific journal. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:07:03
I actually can't do anything right now since I am banned, quickseller is clearly friends with someone who has global moderator powers and that is being abused.
His investigation into my affairs was disturbing to begin with, but I answered every single question he had and spent hours of my time doing so. He kept on attacking me regardless of what I said, I think nothing would've stopped him from giving me negative reputation. He wanted tons of information, the sort of documents only police would ask for, yet he wouldn't even tell me what country he was in. The default trust power is giving him power to coerce information out of others, and he is using his to increase his power and profits on the forum. And now I can't even defend myself against these accusations since I can't post.
I've sold thousands of BTC to hundreds of different customers, never scammed anyone and have resolved every single issue. Often BTC sellers are subject to scam accusations when a scam attempt occurs upon them, and these accusations are often public on bitcointalk. Literally any scammer could've called me out and quickseller would probably take the opportunity to ruin my rep.
I think this may have to do with Bitcoin XT, apparently quickseller is a proponent of XT, and I've made the most popular anti-XT thread on Bitcointalk in the main discussion section. That would explain why he singled me out while ignoring the person who actually tried selling me fraudulent gift cards. 
It's not just about my case though, I am one of many who has been put in this situation. Ultimately the behavior of quickseller and his cronies is damaging bitcointalk, it has turned a forum based on de-centralized ideals into a 1984 environment where anonymous 'trusted' members go out of their way to dig into your affairs, and if you show any opposition to this you get attacked. This scares away tons of Bitcoiners. 
I do appreciate you actually responded to this issue, thank you. I hope you can resolve this issue by talking to those who put him on default trust, or perhaps changing the default trust requirements so quickseller is no longer on it. I would push for this myself but like I said I am banned temporarily. It's only him and maybe a few other people doing this, so I think it would be easily fixed. A large majority of trusted members dont participate in this reputation abuse.
I've been dedicated to posting informative content on bitcointalk for years, and I was a beacon of honesty in the marketplace, so it makes me feel very rejected that I was treated like this. I feel like I've wasted years of effort.
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:32:02
I appreciate that you tried to help by bringing some sense into the thread, it's unfortunate that so many others 100% agree with quickseller... likely since he has dozens if not hundreds of accounts.
@_date: 2015-08-28 00:11:44
I'm definitely not going to store all the data in the blockchain, but will integrate the blockchain into this de-centralized journal program. If I make it right it won't need to store much data on the blockchain, just enough to broadcast the correct encryption for each journal article/comment
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:57:33
The sad part is I did literally hundreds of successful deals on Bitcointalk over the course of years, and contributed thousands of posts. Then it gets all destroyed by someone who I don't know for no good reason, he was out to get me even though I rarely interact with him. 
I'm sickened that the administrators literally did nothing to stop this, I was thrown away like trash. 
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:08:32

All of those individuals must submit to the government, that’s what this article is saying. If China said all mining operators in China had to upgrade to a new government version of Bitcoin they would have to oblige or go to prison

I took a deeper dive into how CME's Bitcoin Futures are definitely the reason for the bear market [ 
It's really critical news, that most of you understand from this article. But this article was broader scope, and once I realized what CME did to the Bitcoin market I had to write an article that focused on that alone.
It's time for Bitcoiners to get angry and to protest, and sue. We have rights, and this is illegal.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:01:00
Bitcoin itself is not regulated, it’s the same as ever. The centralized companies dealing with Bitcoin are the ones that have become regulated. You can open a bitcoin account, and transact bitcoin, without providing any identification info

I am saying do not let institutions control Bitcoin, or it will no longer be decentralized money, and then it is game over! There is obviously a fine line here, between corporations and banks using Bitcoin, and them buying up so much Bitcoin that they control the space. 
When Bitcoiners applaud institutional investment, they applaud the latter. This not about adoption, its about hoarding all the Bitcoins and manipulating the market. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:32:51






@_date: 2018-11-30 05:55:01
Yes, exactly. It’s pure theft, but the government allows it to compromise bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:14:11
Don’t be confused, I’m not talking about paper wallets. Paper Bitcoins on CME is a contract that represents bitcoin but fundamentally has zero bitcoin backing it 
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:06:29
Your reply is articulate, thank you. The danger is by the time we reach the medium of exchange stage Bitcoin might lose its decentralization. It would be better for normal investors, and regular people, to fuel Bitcoin demand. It will get to that level without institutional investors.

Perhaps CME can be sued in a class action lawsuit from all the people that lost money on Bitcoin since 17 December, the day they launched. The connection between CME's Bitcoin futures and the price crash is 100% clear, so much so the Federal Reserve issued a statement. [

The cc purchase is a point where identity is 100% known. I haven’t checked, but I assume Breez requires kyc off the bat if you’re using a cc, to prevent chargebacks, so not even a prepaid card will make you anonymous. Then Blockchain forensics can be used on the lightning network from the point you purchased with a cc
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:42:46
