100 billion USD left the crypto markets in the last 24 hours.  What we are seeing is institutional investors and super rich bastards locking in long term capital gains before the end of the calendar year.
we may not see a symmetrical recovery after this and my guess is not every crypto is going to rebound the same.  these investors will re evaluate their allocations and buy those cryptos that make the most sense

I'm wondering if the fork will cause the current price of one fork to be split as a ratio of the two forks.  Almost like a stock split.

instead of this they can just migrate to litecoin or bitcoin cash

I'm thinking we will see sub $1,000.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:22:23
this is what i'm thinking - at some point we may see parity with bitcoin cash and it could meet sub $1,000
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:31:23
by then, there will be more crypto currencies with established histories and high market caps.  bitcoin won't necessarily increase in value as this happens
