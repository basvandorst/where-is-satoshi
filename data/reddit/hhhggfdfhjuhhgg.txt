A HF can only affect people who install the HF. If you install segwit2x then around 90 days after the segwit softfork you will be hardforked off the bitcoin network onto a new segwit2x one. The original bitcoin network will still exist and still have segwit activated. It may lose a lot of hash rate and slow down for a few months though. The new segwit2x network on the other hand may have more hash power but it starts out with no users (only people who installed it) and very little in the way of support from exchanges and merchants. Its basically just another of the 1000+ altcoins.. The only difference being that everyone who owns bitcoin also starts out owning the same amount of segwit2x coin. This is similar to clamcoin, and the stellar and byteball free ICO giveaways. And very similar to  which is another bitcoin hardfork where everyone who owned bitcoin at the time if the HF now owns bitcore as well.

Both apple and Google sell physical gift cards for their appstores at retailers all over. The only difference is that nobody is speculating on their price appreciating.

They probably did you a favour as bitstamp won't accept funds that didn't come directly from your own bank account. Check out fidorbank.UK, fire.com and bunq.com

No its not possible. Transfer wise has a banned list of bank accounts that belong to bitcoin exchanges, and as in the text you pasted most bitcoin exchanges will only accept wires sent directly from a bank account in the same name as your bitcoin exchange account. Transfer wise transfers are sent from transfer wise, not from you. If you want to use Gemini you probably need to get a USD bank account. Ideally in the us so you can use ACH. I would suggest trading in EUR instead on kraken or bitstamp. You can use a fire.com or bunq.com account to inexpensively transfer EUR.

I don't think so.. The uasf "movement" is a specific proposal to activate a softfork. If someone comes up with a new proposal, it will have a different set of (probably fewer IMO) followers.

Segwit2x doesn't hardfork until 90 days after segwit is activated.. So it initially prevents a chain split that might otherwise happen between uasf nodes and normal nodes, but if people continue to run segwit2x after segwit is activated then in around 90 days segwit2x turns into an altcoin and does indeed split. My guess is that some miners may stop running segwit2x as soon as segwit is activated and maybe there won't even be enough hash power on the segwit2x altcoin and the remaining segwit2x miners will just abandon it too.. But if some persist then everyone will have some segwit2x coins in addition to their bitcoin..
