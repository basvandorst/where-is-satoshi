It was not tautological at all. OP posed a question about if anyone had been tracking a number of coins on the block chain. The post to which I originally responded asked the question "do we even know if they all exist". In a relatively simple manner, I responded yes because OP was referring to coins on the block chain.

I had no issues. Transferred a couple out yesterday and it was moved instantly.

This worries me, and I don't believe it's good news. It seems like an attempt to avoid acknowledgment that bitcoin is an asset.

All the coins on the blockchain exist. Only those on Gox's books could be questionable. How their books map to the blockchain coins is certainly an unknown, but if they owned an address and it contained bitcoin, then those coins once certainly were in their possession.

I would be willing to relinquish my BTC holdings for partial ownership of a new exchange. I would even consider working there. 
I currently live in Tokyo and work in electronic banking.

In the 90s My internet was down every time someone else in the house picked up the phone...

I was worried over all the reports of withdrawal problems this week so I transferred couple bitcoin from my Gox account yesterday. The transfer was instant.

And for Japan residents, it was the only one excepting domestic bank transfer in Yen.

Filing a lawsuit will only recover small portion. I personally would rather have my coins invested in a new business plan. 
I do understand that some may feel differently, especially if they need the money now. My plan was to hold my coins long term anyway I suppose. I was lucky enough to take half out before this fiasco so I'm in the black for now.

I don't believe he would keep quiet. There's nothing to lose by breaking the gag order. It would generate massive international support and make US look like the bad guy for ruining innocent lives.

The answer to the riddle is government frozen assets. 
Not lost, just temporarily stolen. Also comes with a side order of gag.

Thank you for fact checking my statement line by line, dipshit. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:28:42
In that case, why would there be so much stated about the theft of bitcoins and placing blame? If they are not liabilities, why even mention them?
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:49:10
Very nice... I'll donate as soon as I get those coins back :'( At least I have the exact number now.

I am curious if you are operating with US bank account. If so, you may have noticed that ACH debits on your account are allowed by default. As a result, someone can debit your account, as Square did. It's the same reason your can pay bills by allowing companies to debit your account, and do not need to contact your bank to allow it. 
You should also be able to disable this default and disallow direct ACH debit from your account. You may also be able to create filters to allow only certain accounts to direct debit you, such as vendors, etc. The only problem is you will likely need to pay for the service. 
Source: I work in cash management and we do this for all company accounts to prevent fraudulent debits. 
Check out this from citibank:

"Javascript/JQuery - you should be able to write your own code from scratch without use of plugins or library"
Isn't JQuery a library?

As long as they keep JPY domestic transfer, I'll be back. ThAt was the only reason I used it. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:50:22
Jesus Christ man, haven't you read that they can't withdraw!!!
Edit: Seriously, Japan domestic Zengin transfer is my best guess. It's free and instant.

What about issuance of a national security letter blocking access to cold storage? It's possible if using a US bank security deposit box. It would explain why no information has been given. 
I know... it's a long shot, but hasn't been mentioned and quite possible if terrorist money laundering is suspected.

He should just go to France and make his statement. His own gov isn't going to arrest him for breaking a US gag order.

My favorite part is that it actually says January 10th!!

What they have is worth quite a bit. Every one of the addresses is someone who is, (1) interested in getting funds back, (2) bitcoin enthusiast on some level, (3) or maybe japan resident who enjoy domestic funds transfer. Many in the last category will not re-enter the fold until there's another domestic option.

When there is a need to move large sums of cash, banks will request up to a few days notice so they can arrange liquidity and exposure to correspondents if necessary (we're talking billion In a Single transfer) such as large corporate acquisition deals, etc. Most of the largest banks are their own correspondent anyway, operating in multiple countries and holding an account at the central bank of each. In general, these large transactions are accompanied by cash maps to alert each participant of the impending cash flows.
