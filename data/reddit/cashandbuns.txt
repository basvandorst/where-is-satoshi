As a Brazilian, I've been pretty depressed with local news lately. This made me smile and motivated me to help a fellow Brazilian.

Anyone got the link for those bets?

If you're in Argentina (or anywhere outside the English speaking world), a liberal is someone who believes in civil and economic individual liberties, close to what Americans today would call a libertarian. So yes, there's a difference between the tradition of Locke, Mill and Hayek, and the tradition of Fourier, Marx and Gramsci.

Or maybe create a new website. Average annual income in Mozambique is about $600. I know talented people there who would be able to make that much in a week just by doing powerpoint presentations.

I share the optimism, but I think op's title is a bit misleading.

Twist: all of that came from ghash owners buying the AMD R9.

It's actually a bit surprising that the print edition of The New York Times is still being sold 30+ years later.

Wow! Thank you! I didn't know this existed. You guys ever tried to work with kipochi and bitpesa?

I agree! Although it's a flawed analogy, we should look at it not with engineering logic, but with psychological intuition. People usually interpret current events through narrative models. When communicating to a mass audience, don't think of BTC as Bitcoin the currency, or Bitcoin the protocol, but as Bitcoin the plot. Bitcoin and Napster share the same literary archetype: the trickster, the one that disrupts the status quo with his wits and secret knowledge. Now, we've got to accept and understand that role to move beyond it (and leave it to dogecoin).

How bizarre is our current balance of power that we have to trust on Russia's support of technological freedom.

Now everyone will have to mention *Newsweek* again when reporting the story. They haven't felt this relevant in a while.
