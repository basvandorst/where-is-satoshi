You're right - we've pretty much created one of most valuable currencies on earth, solely by all believing it has value and selling that idea to others. Good job.

Why, the decentralized police of course! &gt;Nekminnit NATO / NSA attempt to start a "decentralized" online police force.

I'd like to think that was a wittier comparison than deservant of the title "meme."

Thanks for the reply, lots for me to consider and I appreciate the input! The way I see it - The paypass credit option &gt;methodology&lt; is in use because it works, and incredibly well. Should it be possible to apply this to BTC in a manner that would suit the new system (backing any 'anonymous' wallet outright, while putting in bare essential fraud checks.) Could it be possible to decentralize the system also? I'll go and read his whitepaper shortly. 
Also in regards to funding, this would obviously be rolled out on a small-scale initially - and as you'd only need to charge enough to meet money lost, I'm sure any fees would be incredibly minuscule, while this model scales with the size of rollout perfectly.

I'm pretty sure someone knows where it went.
