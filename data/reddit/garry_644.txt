Still not a single username to show us? Why is that if there are "plenty of examples"?
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:16:23
Well, there are the excuses and downvotes. Exactly as predicted. 
This place is a riot. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:10:09
Plenty? Links?
And exactly how old does my username have to be allowed to post according to you?
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:24:18
Just like in the 200 similar threads noone will be able to point out ONE SINGLE paid shill. 
What does that tell you?
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:42:35
Sure. I believe you. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 10:37:58
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:22:09
Uh what?
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:19:25
Anyone who is critical of OP's post is downvoted to hell. 
I don't think i have to explain how thick the irony is right now, do i? 
Hilarious.

I must've missed it as well but i'm sure he will come up with 'plenty' of links for us now to back up his claim. I mean he would look quite stupid if he didn't.

Nobody has any idea if any of those will happen in the first place so how about we wait for that first. 
So far there is no sign of Wallstreet being interested at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:32:37
Why should it be sarcastic what he said? He is right. It's none of their business in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:00:50
Ok, well you're completely right. 
OP, can you please show me some botnets or paid banker shills, or anything like that active in this sub?
Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:33:46
Yes. They do this all the time. Yet people keep using them and them come cry here when it happens to them. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:29:31
Amazing. Nobody has thought of this before. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:17:18
We're waiting.

The only real voting manipulation i saw here was from a pro Bitcoin cultist who ran like 10 usernames and downvoted everyone who was even slightly critical of Bitcoin. 
But that was all fine and good according to this sub's residents because it was pro Bitcoin. 
I haven't seen any voting manipulation or anything close to paid shills from anti Bitcoiners so far. Yet i have to read 3 long ass posts, like yours, about it every day. 
Not one person has been able to point out a paid shill or something similar here. I would ask you to do so but i know you will fail, come up with silly excuses why and downvote me for asking, so i'm not even gonna bother.
