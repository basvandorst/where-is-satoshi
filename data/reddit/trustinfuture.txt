Thx for the comments. My mistake: I changed it in BCH...meaning Bitcoin Cash, BCC, BCH Bitcoin ABC, Cash...whatever other name/label has been put forward for the August 1 8Mb HF-coin.

Yep. In November the governance model will be put to an even more serious test. Can't wait to see the result :-)

With PR/marketing I not necessarily meant them promoting bitcoin as-is. What I meant is Core giving the public in general some insight in the way they operate (how they set priorities going forward) and their vision on how Bitcoin *might* evolve in the future. No high expectations...just an insight in the workings of Open software development and their ambitions. With PR I mean informing and educating the public....people like me who are not developers.

I'm a free man...I burn my money on whatever I want. If I burn myself in the process: my own fault. I know the risks. That is my responsibility. But my 80yo mother getting scammed by some slick talking financial person...Other matter.

Decentralization is the only thing that make Bitcoin stand out? Read the white paper again my friend.

How they scammed me: On the day I spend EUR100,= in theis sceme this EUR 100 would have bought me aprox 11 ETH. After 1 year cloudmining I accumulated roughly 6 ETH. So I'd been MUCH better of just buying the ETH instead of cloudmining Aprox 5 ETH better of....with now (16 month after the event) would be over $1200 better off. But hey... that is only after the fact. These days I just buy and hold. But of course you do what you think is fun. And we all make mistakes.

Thx for your reply, lowfatbiscuits. I Agree with you saying: " blood in the streets (...) before Bitcoin's story is told. This isn't going to be comfortable." 
I disagree with the 'first the community must understand.." part. 
Jihan's recent talk on the future of Bitcoin in Arnhem in The Netherlands was pretty clear about that: Milgram experiment, bandwaggon effect: The community will follow the leader willy nilly. His view, not mine.

You'r exactly right! Not only communication technologies...but EVERY new technology will be used for good AND bad.  I was not saying bitcoin is only bad (else I would not be involved: I believe ultimately it can do more good than bad for humanity)...what I'm saying is bitcoin (the technology) ALONE can never be the holy grail in finance.

I wander how you think innovation in bitcoin is suddenly going to stop after 8 years.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:20:23
Can't recommend it. Over a year ago I invested a small amount worth 11 ETH at the time in Hashflare. after a year I got a returned a total between 6-7 ETH. Worth a lot more now than my inital investment BUT basically they scammed me out of 4-5 ETH.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:47:10
I hope you not mind I disagree. Innovation in bitcoin never stopped...The IMPLEMENTATION of these innovations in bitcoin did. But thats the beauty of the governance model of bitcoin: no concensus...no change: Not 1 party (constituency) that can force changes in the protocol. 
So it LOOKS like there is no innovation in bitcoin. Yet the innovation is there but it needs time for the incentives for all constituencies to line up.

Since an aircraft-carrier is useless in crypto... there Americans have the SEC for 'protection'. :-)

Sure. So it SEEMS. That's the point: Bitcoins SEEMS stagnant and not evolving but the innovations kept continuing. Like for example Segwit (where all the fuzz is about these days).
Befor ideas like this can be implemented in the production environment of bitcoin they need to be developed but they also need to be tested. The latter can take years. During that time nothing seems to be happening in bitcoin. But in the background this innovation is wildly discussed, tuned, re-evaluated, rechearched tested again discussed again, improved again...all on a testnet....until it is considered fit to be implemented in the real world. These things take time.
Sure you can cut corners and rush them in....then you run the risk ending bitcoin in a disaster.

I wonder.... does it feel any better to be screwed by a bitcoin exchange instead of a banking system?

Here I disagree...among the first victims of the 'Nigerian 419 Scam' where university proffessors. Intelligence alone is not gonne save you (or me) from being scammed.

Thx for your helpful reply! As I understand your arguments 1,2 and 3 big companies don’t see any (financial) incentive to explore bitcoin at the moment: Too small a market, no clear regulation, their not feel comfortable dealing with bitcoin. Is that about right?
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:18:11
The question is: Does anyone KNOW...like in links to public statements, insider information or -preferribly- being the CFO of one of those companies and explain this here to the public ;-)
