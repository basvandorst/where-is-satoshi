Did you deposit it to your USD wallet or buy BTC/LTC right away?

Maybe it has been, but is bitcoin officially mainstream? At least as far as people knowing about it? My redneck cousin just bought some and that's saying a lot.

Now if you can put what you would he been paying loans into an ETF. Bull market now is getting 20-30% returns. Obviously not as good as what BTC got you, but at least your money will be making you money in a bull market.

New people panic because they were told this was a free money machine

So what plans are in place for the future? Speaking in terms of crypto all together. This is the 2nd time in a week coinbase couldn't handle an increase in traffic. Hard to get people on board with a new currency when you can't even get access to it.

Everyone who owned bitcoin was trying to buy and sell at the exact moment.

I thought coinbase went ahead and gave you your BTC when you initiate a bank transfer? It looked like when I bought mine is showed how much I got, and then 5 days later I had the same amount despite the rise in BTC price. Maybe not...

I think of bitcoin as playing any casino game. You could hit it big, or you could lose it all. Either only go in with money you can afford to lose.
