I agree, and it's instant. You don't need to wait for days for you to get your Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:44:29
Only possible if all countries prohibit bitcoin and when internet no longer exists, which I don't think will ever happen.
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:05:17
 Yeah, I have friends who got scammed at LBC and switched to Paxful. And they haven't had any issues with it, pretty decent. I'm a Paxful user as well. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 10:10:38
Umm, what for? It defeats the purpose of having bitcoins in the first place
@_date: 2018-09-18 07:57:31
Lol if you haven't heard the news already, LBC is dropping its trade volume and more users are switching to Paxful. Lol it just shows how bad Localbitcoins is operating cause they're losing their users. And still you're here try to revive LBCs name by telling people that it has a good reputation when clearly it's not doing any good at all. Come on tell us already, how much are you really earning from Localbitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:41:23
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:36:07
Pretty sure they're aware. Don't know if they're doing anything to improve their service though.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:08:46
God, that's awful. My friends had the same situation with LBC. I would never recommend localbitcoins to anyone, shit service.
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:01:59
I don't trust localbitcoins either. Although Paxful and LBC has a lot of similarities, I would still opt for Paxful over LBC. They have a much dependable customer support than LBC when bad stuff happens.
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:03:02
FINALLY! It's great that people now recognizes Paxful and how helpful + easy it is to use. And in case you guys didn't know, they also operate humanitarian projects and now they're building another school in Africa! SML :-)
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:13:51
And clearly, they don't read or watch the news. If they do, they would probably have an idea about what's happening to Africa and Venezuela and how bitcoin is helping these people survive the inflation.

There are lots of bitcoin wallets and each are built for different purposes. If you're planning on investing/saving your bitcoins, using a hardware wallet and storing it in a safe is ideal. That will surely keep your bitcoins secure from hackers. But if you're planning on purchasing stuff, try Paxful. Once you sign up, you automatically get a free wallet and they have more than 300 payment methods to choose from.
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:16:17
I agree but it gets creepy sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:34:10
I highly doubt it
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:15:01
same. better to play safe on this matter lol
@_date: 2018-10-01 08:17:20
Harsh but true lol
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:22:36
Maybe try paxful instead? Similar to localbitcoins but has better customer service and payment options.
@_date: 2018-10-09 07:30:33
Try Paxful, just look for vendors with fair rates. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:00:38
Try Paxful.
@_date: 2018-10-04 10:55:36
There are lots of ways to buy bitcoins aside from using a credit card. I don't really recommend using that cause it will compromise your anonymity. There are peer to peer platforms like Paxful that accepts gift cards as payment. There are vendors that doesn't require IDs. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:13:30
Same! I started with Dogecoin as well. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:00:54
Paxful, Bisq, or Hodl Hodl. Don't go to Localbitcoins, spare yourself the hassle.
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:52:41
\^Yup. And their website is user-friendly unlike any other platforms out there. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:06:49
But I really wouldn't recommend Localbitcoins, especially now that their quality of service is going downhill. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:49:28
This. I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:18:51
I agree. Or better yet, invest only what you don't need in the short term.
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:20:23
P2P platforms are great, but you might wanna hold on to it for now and exchange it to fiat when the price increases.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:00:32
I totally agree with this one. Lol. They fucking suck.
@_date: 2018-11-14 11:17:07
If they only knew that Localbitcoins can be a huge pain in the ass.. Maybe now they should improve their customer support FOR REAL. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:02:03
Yeah. Paxful's actually similar to LBC but way better lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:50:02
\^This. I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:03:36
They just want the moolah, tsk tsk.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:10:53
I think we all know that it's localbitcoins, lol. Just leaving it out here.
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:13:06
It's great that people are acknowledging Paxful now, it's actually a good platform.
