Is there an ELI5 on this?

 From the ATF - 
Illegal explosive devices are often manufactured and used during the fireworks season. The explosive compositions in these devices are typically extremely sensitive to heat, shock, electrostatic discharge, and friction that may initiate unexpectedly causing serious injury or death. The risks associated with these devices are further compounded because the persons manufacturing, transporting and using these devices often do not have the knowledge, skills, and experience required for such activities.
Many law enforcement agencies consider these explosive devices, commonly referred to as M-80s, M-100s, quarter sticks, cherry bombs, and silver salutes, illegal because they exceed the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's explosive weight limits for consumer fireworks. Additionally, these devices may also be illegal under similar state laws and local ordinances.

No the factory is still building it

Take the day off and look for it. If you find it buy a safe and put it inside of it.

Crash just means we all buy more since we're hodling anyway.

Btc is like the mp3 format. MP3's brought down and changed the music industry forever while the format itself is still pretty much unchanged. Competitors came and went.  Btc will do the same with money and the banking industry.

I'm holding and I want it to bottom out so I can buy more. It'll recover.

Down, down, down!!! I want to buy more at rock bottom prices. It'll go back up. Big drop right now as of this post. Going down fast and hard.

It looks like gouging.  Hundreds more is insane. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:13:26
Already back over $4800.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:44:20
I own it so I'm losing money but I get so pumped when it drops so I can but more.  Btc needs more fuel to get to the moooooooon!

!Remindme 30 months from now
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:45:21
Under that as of this post but no need to panic. It'll bounce back. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:10:30
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:57:52
Up $100 in the last 5 minutes!
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:03:09
It's done dipped a lot lower than your dip in the last few hours.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:18:09
This is not the dip. This is another moon shot. You'll know when it dips when everyone outside of here claims Btc is dying.

All these different exchanges/prices! What a pain.
