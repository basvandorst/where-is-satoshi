Apple updated their rules/guidlines for app store allowing virtual currencies. There's no 'getting around'.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:42:01
I tell ya, this is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:53:11
What term did you search for? I search for 'dildo' and it didn't turn anything relevant.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:13:08
Ok that makes sense though. I didn't know that.
Regardless, that sucks dude, hope you can get your $ back.
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:01:13
I call it in-control malleability.
@_date: 2014-11-01 21:48:53
Oh r/bitcoin, you're so silly!
@_date: 2014-04-10 07:52:50
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:31:30
This would have worked better IMO 
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:23:34
Well said.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:09:02
Dude, if I was ever sending $$ to an exchange first time, I would atleast send them the minimum amount required to them first to see and make sure everything is OK atleast.
The fact that you sent 12 grand at once. I don't know man. BTC-e might be a scam, but you had it coming. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:37:20
Yea, 2 customers! Whole 2 customers!

Na, came down to low 50s. I was there and I saw what it did. Still remember it like it was yesterday.

Is MtGox open source? Then why is that allowed to be discussed but another exchange needs to be open source otherwise it's can't be discussed?
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:43:25
My balance shows $0.000 WTF!?!?!?

It doesn't have any bitcoins. It's balance is 0. And don't share your priv key in public. Anyone could have claimed your bitcoins (if there were any).

5.4btc to 29 btc. Not bad at all. No need to kick yourself. Go to sleep. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:52:36
I am interested. PM me for details.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:12:41
If it makes you feel better, I lost quite a bit too. About 80%. 
I made about 65% of it back now day trading. Hang in there.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:44:39
Did you recently do this and get it within 24 hour? I wired it yesterday morning but still haven't received anything.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:43:22
Why diversify between 2-3 exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:00:12
My first tip. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:58:05
I bought at 240 in April. I sold immediately at 50% after the crash. Been kicking myself since. So sell now, and kick your sell 8 months from now. Or hold, and forget about it and reap the rewards later.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:52:38
Would love to see a guide on this. In the same situation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:39:36
It's gone. When it comes to generating BTC addresses, NEVER use an online wallet or key generating website. Who's to say the programmer of this website doesn't log the inputs in a database, scan every couple of days and cash out/?
People are so naive and gullible...
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:58:58
In volatile situations, like now, it's really easy. I trade during these times, but in normal not-so-bitcoin-level-volatile times, I sit on BTC as it appreciates. That's my strategy.
So yes, you can do this and you can make a lot of money, but only at certain times (volatile) and only if your are semi-good at least. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:09:11
Lol. Every once in a while, I take a peek into r/Bitcoin to see buthurt people touting slogans of 'SPARTAN HOLD'. And I am never disappointed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:58:00
Guessing what?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:51:10
Lmfao. That's too funny. Oh lord.
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:28:25
Can you explain what you mean by outputs? Are you saying that it is possible to send 1 cent (worth of BTC) given I pay a fee?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:12:38
I won't cash out. That was never my plan. Working on a btc ATM at the moment. I believe in btc. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:43:07
According to that graph, we are in return to "normal" phase.
@_date: 2013-07-01 15:28:44
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:50:16
639.44 and then rebound back to 822.15.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:55:15
80%. 50% of it is stuck in a wire, will soon be in btc.

21 yrs old, freelance programmer. Bought 5500 worth at 155, 6500 worth at 250. So total invested = 12000, current worth (given i can sell for 120) ~ 6000. Lost 50% in a week. FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD, THEY SAID.

I don't want to give you the wrong impression. This is a proper crash. I am not sure when you bought, but if you bought at 1000+, chances are, we are not going to visit those price for a while. My guess would be several months. And it's going to be difficult looking at the ticker. So just chill out and forget about it.
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:34:29
How about this:  ?

Blowing things out of proportion...I am just as excited as you, but keep it real please. Thanks.

'If bitcoins were 'worth' 130 before someone decided to dump 20k they are still worth 130 now.'
That's a BIG 'If'. What makes you think that same someone who dumped 20k to drop it down to 118 wasn't the same person who pumped it earlier from 118 to 130?

"I am watching you and I am looking over you." (implying they can/will regulate it in the future)
LMFAO. Doubt he even understands how bitcoin works. The fact that he said that shows his lack of understanding.
