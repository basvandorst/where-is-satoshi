inflation makes people who hold hard assets relatively better off than people with few assets. The asset values rise with or near inflation. HYPER inflation has been more rare to the point that it doesn’t always act the same as last time because it only happens if something bad is happening in the regional economy.

Oh, I wasn’t addressing anything other than if the natural gas usage to mine bitcoin was good or not. It is better than what would be done with the gas otherwise. It is using an otherwise wasted resource and not increasing emissions or heat. It would be better if they trapped the natural gas and sent it to homes... but that is not profitable.

Smart people do not honestly expect bitcoin to replace usd in the near future... the people who are claiming that are of a few groups:
1)dreamers- wishful thinking among people relatively rich in bitcoin and poor in US dollars 
2)no-thinkers- people who don’t understand economics at all
What I do expect to happen are that:
1)bitcoin will be used as a secondary currency
2)some banks will hold some bitcoin as a hedge against inflation
3)banks will allow bitcoin as collateral for loans
4)crypto-banks will come about (actually starting to see this- crypto.com is one example)
5)price of bitcoin will go very high as it is:
 
a better store of value than real estate, art, gold, and stocks
a better payment network than visa, MasterCard, checks, wires, PayPal, libre, and Venmo
And a better currency than usd.

If bitcoin actually gets used as legal tender replacing USD, then the economy would have to become deflationary... at least as long as users are being added. 
As more people are onboarded, the same about of bitcoin must be shared to more people. Thus value must go up. If value goes up, prices stated in that currency go down. That is deflation. Once/if full adoption is reached, then it will shift to much lower inflation than we have now (and it is predictable as it is written in the protocol) 
In a deflationary economy, people are encouraged to save money and spend less. Debt is discouraged. Prices fall (value of an item stays the same though). If you assume that constantly using more energy, buying more stuff, and using more of earth’s resources is good (current economic goal of infinite growth).
In an inflationary economy, people are encouraged to spend more and save less. Debt is encouraged because it can be paid back with inflated dollars. Prices increase. In theory wages should increase(haven’t in the last few decades though). As long as wages increase at the same rate as inflation, people are fine. Those with certain classes of assets will get richer (gold, real estate, stocks, bitcoin) because the price of those things usually go up with or above inflation.
Each year we use more energy, buy more stuff, and use more resources. Eventually we will run out of certain resources. Our continuous energy usage will change our climate.
I see bad aspects of both types... if only we could reach a steady state economy... like bitcoin in 2140.

First! Did you save the recovery seed somewhere (preferably two somewheres) safe?
Next do you feel comfortable with mycelium... like you think it will be easy to you. I have it on my phone, but I already use wallet of satoshi and coinomi so I haven’t tried it out much.
Finally with mycelium it is as easy as 
1) hit receive
2) copy the address at the bottom
3) hit send at coinbase
4) paste the address in
5) send a small test amount to make sure you have it right
6) repeat with the rest
But if you are willing to add one more step you can save some fees.
Pro.coinbase does not charge a fee to send out bitcoin.
If you go to pro.coinbase and then deposit from coinbase to coinbase pro, you can save some money.
Seems silly I know, but they want to make as much as they can in fees off of newbs in order to keep the more experienced interested in their service. I can’t even remember how much they charge as a “network fee” because I haven’t paid it in so long.

The trezor holds the private keys that allow you to send the bitcoin. The seed words can recreate the keys on any wallet. If a hardware wallet actually held the bitcoin, they would be the dumbest things ever. Lose one and you could lose potentially millions of dollars... but if you have the recovery seed, then you still have them.

The unused natural gas is currently being flared(burned) in order to keep it from accumulating and exploding.
Methane is also a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. 
if it just released, it works as a greenhouse gas and warms the planet by trapping heat and creates a safety hazard at the wellsite.
If you burn it to mine bitcoin, you take methane that would be released and making CO2 + water + bitcoin + heat. 
Basically you take the energy that will just be sent into the atmosphere and harmed a portion as a local generator to mine bitcoin. 
It drives up the cost to produce a bitcoin which causes less efficient miners to have to shut down.
It further decentralizes mining as well.
The only people this hurts are the people using dirty expensive electricity to mine... this is usually coal aka the dirtiest energy commonly used.

You don’t think that injecting 1.2 million a year into the economy of a town of 100,000 people will do anything?
I just checked my childhood hometown on census stats 
population ~90k. Adults ~66k
Total retail 1.02 million.
Adding another .8 million to that economy would completely change it.
The average per employee income is 23,452 
The median household income is 36,777
That for the 80% of households there with 2+ adults would be 65% raise.
Single people would get a ~50% raise.
For towns like this, the town is getting worse every day. People are getting desperate, desperate people do desperate things. 
Drugs and crime are on the uptick. Gangs are taking over once safe neighborhoods. Local stores are closing. Even national chains are closing stores. Shopping centers are sitting vacant and vandalized. Houses do not sell for any price. Former new car dealerships are being replaced by buy here pay heres.

Edit: for the record... I don’t know hardly anything about this woman. I had never hear her name until like a week ago. I am opposed to open borders and would prefer stricter limits on legal immigration. I would also prefer more funding for border patrol.
Ok now it’s clear. I was confused. You agree she got her citizenship legally... you just think we should create a new way for revoking the citizenship of a us citizen.
That would be very handy for people wanting to remove legal immigrants from the country.
If you want to use the current laws and regulation, you and people who agree with you need to find evidence that she lied on HER naturalization paperwork or interview, that she knew she was lying, and that she wouldn’t have been approved if she told the truth or that the lie influenced the decision.
The paperwork would have been in 2000 if you want to freedom of information act it, 
You might be able to find something in there... people lie all the time. She married the man you think is her brother in 2009... so that won’t help. Maybe she lied about something else important though. Maybe a lawyer could convince a court, appeals court, and Supreme Court, that her lie was important enough to revoke the citizenship of a woman who has been a citizen for nearly two decades And voted for by enough people to get elected to Congress.
I am opposed to open borders, think our immigration policies are too lax, and recognize that illegal immigration is illegal and should be punished. 
But if you want to kick someone out of the country, they have to have done very specific things... or congress needs to pass new laws that allow them to revoke it for the reasons their constituents want.
We shouldn’t set a precedent that people can be kicked out of the country for breaking rules the president doesn’t agree with... imagine if someone like Bernie was elected. Would you want him to kick out people who break rules he doesn’t like?

With those two features they can batch the transactions even further.

People need pay raises to combat inflation reducing their purchasing power. Inflation in usually defined as a decrease in purchasing power. 
That is due to supply of dollars increasing faster than the supply of users.
Technology is actually a deflationary force. It becomes cheaper in real value terms to produce most things over time. 
That’s why scarce things like real estate and stocks increase in price faster than inflation.
If there were no inflation people would still be getting raises for performance, but cost of living adjustments would go away.

You know that in order to take $1000 in vat tax, you have to spend over $10,000 per month. Even if there are no exceptions for staples like food, gas, electricity, mortgage, medicine, etc (which there will be), anyone that Spends less than 120,000/year would come out ahead. 
Anyone that Spends more than that will be taxed more than they receive. Who spends more than 120,000 a year on things other than listed above? Not lower income people. Lower income people hardly ever spend money outside those categories.

Well he isn’t a politician really. He was running a nonprofit helping entrepreneurs create startups in economically disadvantaged communities... he looked around and saw how technological unemployment was causing problems. He decided no one was going to do anything about it so it was up to him to do something. He wrote a book about the problem and was encouraged to run. So now he is running for president because no other politician even wants to admit it is a problem.

I plan to buy until 45k. Then sell small pieces on the run up to 75-110. Rebuy as soon as it is back below 50k. The last nearly a decade it has been moving between two logistic curves that are converging. If it hits the top line In March - nov 2021 that will be 75-110. Then if it gently kisses the bottom line after a year of falling, that will be 20-45k. Then 2-4 years after that around 250-500k

A couple of things.
1) market cap does not equal the amount invested so far. If you try and buy 1 million bitcoin, the price would skyrocket as not all bitcoin are for sale at all times. You can only buy from people wanting to sell.
2)many young people that otherwise were not saving any money are now trimming budgets to accumulate bitcoin. My investment accounts I have been accumulating slowly over 5 years are less than my btc holding... but neither are very high.

The exchange rate increase get people to hold a speculative amount. Then they get more comfortable and hold more as savings/investment as they feel more comfortable with the store of value.

My favorite analogy is the beads on a string. 
Consider some coin with a hole in it like the 5 yen coin.
You and another person decide to do business together. You put a 50 coins on a string tied between you. Since it is your money, the coins are at your end. They have strings connecting to other people as well. 
You decide to spend 10 coins to someone on this network. You pass a note to your partner stating how much you want to send and where. They add their name and pass it along to another person down one of their strings. Repeat until it gets to the destination.
The destination announces they have a route and everyone on this route slides 10 coins at the same time. You have 10 less coins on your side. Everyone along the way has the name number. The destination has 10 more. 
Repeat this until you need those coins somewhere else. Then you and the other person tally up how many coins are on each side, cut the string, and divide them up.
It’s more complicated than that, but the analogy works to show it visually.

Actually, the fed reserve has an inflation target of 2%. They want inflation partially because it helps gdp to “grow”.  They create money digitally by giving loans to commercial banks. They control how much partially by changing the interest rate on the loans.
They also create money buy buying treasury notes with “new dollars”
Then the commercial banks take this loan and multiply it. If the banks now have say 10 million dollars in dollars on their account ledger, they can give out ~100 million in loans. These are new dollars that were printed/created/whatever term makes most sense to you. Then you spend it on a car/tractor/yacht/drugs/etc. and it ends up back in a bank. They can then multiply it by 10 and give out new loans.
This ”grows the economy”. 
There is more us debt then there are us dollars to pay it back... And it is the same in any country I am aware of. The trick only works as long as they keep making new dollars to put into the economy. That is why a fast food cheeseburger/house/car cost twice as much every ~20 years.
If they let inflation get ”too low”, then GDP doesn't grow ”fast enough” and people get scared and stop investing, stock prices go down and they fire people, then GDP stops growing... That is what we call a recession.
This kills the economy, raises unemployment, incentivizes automation, which raises unemployment, and then we get a depression
A recession/depression can be (not always) just caused by the markets (just a group of people) freaking out about GDP.

If it stays between 13.5 and 7500 between now and oct1, it suggest this bull period is similar most have been that should peak around 95-105k near July 2021 and crash back down to around 35k
If it breaks that top this is going to rise much faster, have trouble reaching 80k, peak around January 2021 and crash back down to just over 20k
If it drops below that again it suggest a slower more prolonged run to 150-200k

But seriously don’t let this be the last of your learning, dyor( do your own research), learn about wallet options and choose a good one, and if you get in for larger amounts consider a hardware wallet.
If you end up with a life changing amount, make sure you have a will and include information about how to get access so your family won’t lose it. It could be as simple as “open the lockbox in the basement and take the words you find to uncle jimmy... he will know what to do with it.” 
If you have a little more, maybe replace uncle jimmy with a lawyer that acts with executor if your will. 
Ignore this last part unless you are an obscenely wealthy paranoid person with &gt;1000 btc or your tinfoil hat is on a little too right ;)
If you have enough that the lawyer would risk being disbarred to get it, then You are pretty darn lucky and you win! Buy a ledger, a trezor, and print a paper wallet for a 2 of three multisig wallet. Give the trezor to said lawyer. Etch the seed words to the paper wallet on a sheet of titanium and bury under the rose bush out back. Keep the ledger on your person and memorize the seed words.

Bitcoin node- no financial incentive unless your tin foil hat means you think other nodes are out to get you.
Lightning- if you put a fair amount of bitcoin into opening channels to other well connected nodes then you can make a sat or two per transaction that routes through your node. If you are playing the long game you would eventually make back enough to cover your channel opening fees... if you have free/nearly free electricity. 
But if your solar powered house is in a state where you can sell your electricity back to the grid, you would make more by turning off the computer and running the meter backward instead. Or having one less coffee a month. Or programming your thermostat better. Or switching to led lights. Or fixing that drafty door.

You got so much right about how the current system work... But also some very common misconceptions about the monetary supply.

Super quick overview of the feds favorite tool.
The do influence the size of the monetary supply... But do not control how much currency is printed.
Commercial banks actually create new dollars directly on their ledger books each time they give a loan. They create the new money according to the rules(reserve requirement) set by the central bank. The collect interest in money they poofed into existence. This makes them more money than fees do.

4)daily supply halving next year

6)6-10% growth of global fiat monetary supply
7)3.5% historical inflation of USD 
If 10% of gold plus fiat is replaced by bitcoin, 10 trillion divided by 15 million is $666,666.66! Bitcoin devil in 2023!

A slower less volatile growth would invite much less fomo. That would mean fewer people get in for more than their finances and risk tolerance can handle. And the correction from all-time high would be slower and smaller. 
I don't understand the people who are hoping for 100k this year. From the long term, trendlines 100k isn't possible this year. If it were to run up that fast, they would greedily hold out for 100k+. They wouldn't sell ( what they want to do) and it would go back down to 15k. Then they would be crying on here about losing more than they could afford.
From its whole history bitcoin has been moving in a channel bounded by two converging logistic regression curves on the log chart. This makes sense because the adoption of new tech follows the same s curve growth as an animal population when entering a new niche. If bitcoin’s price growth follows the same pattern as the adoption of nearly every technology, it should oscillate around a logistic regression... Like it has.

The saying around here is “not your keys not your bitcoin” 
Keys are basically the password to the computer encryption that allows you to move/spend your bitcoin. Crypto.com, cash app, and coinbase all hold your keys for you. You have to ask them to send your bitcoin somewhere. When you control your keys, you move your bitcoin whenever you want.

I mean I know someone who is worth about 10-15 million, occasionally carries around 5-10k in $50 dollar bills to look at a good deal on cars to flip and routine 500-1000 in his wallet. He doesn’t even lock his truck all the time... and he hasn’t been robbed.
And he makes his money in renting shitty trailers and houses to terrible, shady, people for cash... so plenty of people with motive know who he is.

Ok. That’s not anything like sales taxes we have now... I feel like what you are talking about is closer to excise taxes, but it’s been a while since Econ. The only issue I have seen for excise taxes is who gets to choose what is taxed and how much. 
I agree you could in theory make a very progressive tax system with this idea... it would just be very complicated.

I didn't say they lose 40 cents a gallon... I said their larger profit margin is on everything you buy if you come inside. The idea was that even if they have a small loss per gallon because of this, they make up for it because you came inside and thought a hotdog and a coke sounded good.

It’s a hard concept for some people to get, at least in part, because many people believe that bank vaults hold all the dollars the bank has... they don’t realize any of the facts regarding reserve requirements, loans creating new money, most money only existing in a digital ledger. 
If people understood those concepts, bitcoin would be obvious. I have had more luck explaining bitcoin to 80 year olds than 40 year olds. 
We are running out of people that lived through the Great Depression... no wonder we keep screwing with the banking system. 
My 93 year old grandmother is not quite sure she trusts bitcoin fully... but she knows she doesn’t trust banks, att, the credit card company, amazon, Walmart, and the news.

Well they also treat selling pesos for stuff if the price swung wildly. The irs treats foreign currency, btc, and houses the same. If you went to Mexico and got 100 dollars worth of pesos, then the exchange rate doubled, you would owe cap gains... But they wouldn't know or care because its too small to care. If you make 100k trading forex last year, then yeah cap gains.
I think a reasonable regulation would be that transactions smaller than x are untaxed with a daily or monthly transaction limit for the exemption. Wallet software could be adapted to fit that. It could still be gamed... But you can cheat on your taxes no matter what. But most people in gov, don't understand the tech well enough to really get it.

Until you have a stroke at the age of 31 and honestly forget all of your passwords and security questions. More common than you would think... probably more common than getting hacked for your .135 btc. 
Seriously people, take some precautions, don’t be stupid... but also unless you have enough btc to be a target be reasonable. 
And if you do happen to have like 300btc you probably need a 2 of 3 multisig with a lawyer/trust executor who has instructions about how to make sure your funds get to next of kin with the third set key in a safe deposit box your spouse/mother/brother etc will be able to access if you are incapacitated.
Which is more likely? You being kidnapped and tortured for your private keys? Or you being in a car wreck with your family knowing you had bitcoin but no way to access it...

The value of btc is whatever the buyers want to buy it for. When there are not as many buyers as sellers for a certain price, the price goes down. If the price drops fast enough people get scared and don’t want to buy until price goes up. So it goes down more. And then it is January 2018 again. 
On the other hand, when someone wants to buy btc, they must find a seller. If there are not enough sellers at a certain price, the price rises. When the supply of sellers start running low, you get nov 2017.
Both were caused by the lack of liquidity it seems you are worried about.
IMHO the reason bitcoin has such insane volatility is that there are not enough market makers yet. Market makers buy and sell at nearly any price. They make money of if the spread and get richer and richer. Yet right now they could make more by hodling. When the price has indications that it might be finding its price in a few years-decades, market makers will step in and stabilize the price so they can make money off the spread. And then we can use it as real currency again and as a store of value.

I explained bitcoin to my now 93 year old grandmother in late 2017. She has asked about it a few times since. She thinks it is a good idea because it is too easy to write fake checks and use cloned debit cards... but she also wants and alexa spot to watch her doorbell camera and control her lights because her iPhone screen is too small. And hopes self driving cars get a little better in her lifetime so she can have one.

Nearly every analysis of potential bitcoin price is missing 2 variables. Both of which lead to underestimation. Inflation of fiat currencies and that market cap does not equal liquidity. There are not 21 million bitcoin. Between lost coins/keys, user errors burning coins to invalid addresses, and coins not yet mined , you end up with estimates between 12-14 million.
Then... as price rises the sellers drop away until a certain point. The point is usually when the curve gets “too steep,” if bitcoin manages to induce a little less fomo, no one knows where the “too steep” will be.
If there are 13 million accessible coins, how many will “hodl” to their deathbed, how many won’t sell until the price they think it should go to, if there are only a few million for sale for any price and fidelity, Elon musk, bill gates, and a few Saudi princes fight over them? 
This is not a prediction for the next bull run, or even the one after that... but eventually there will be a final bull run. It will level off at some price and will track with inflation of the world monetary supply. Will that be 30k, 300k, 3 million, 30 million... no one knows.
I think we should start expressing these predictions as “% of the world’s monetary supply.” Right now we are at slightly&gt;0%

I'm just curious the reasoning... I have been honestly trying to figure out if they would want to watch their house burn down because they didn't read the terms and conditions of their fire protection program.
And considering a large portion of the population gets more in benefits from the government then they pay in... It only makes sense for them to hold that opinion of they make a very high income.
I mean 78000 of income/gains are exempt from cap gains tax... If I become a crypto millionaire, I just wouldn't realize more gains than that. You only realize gains when you sell... So just spend less than 78,000 a year as a married couple and have no long term capital gains tax. I mean even if I had 1000 btc, I still don't think I would spend more than 80,000 of it a year.
I would keep living my normal life, just never worrying about money again. I like my life... Just would like to be in a situation I never worried about money again. I think that number will eventually be less than 5-10 bitcoin.

The growth will continue to look exponential until the increase in adoption starts to slow. Traditionally with new technologies the adoption starts to slow at around 70-80 percent of the potential market. 
The real place where people are disagreeing (without even realizing they are disagreeing) is about where “full” adoption will be. 
Will bitcoin become a new asset class that is used like gold(target price .5 mil) ? Will it become more important than gold(1 mill 2019 dollars)? Will it become the new world reserve currency that settles international transactions (10 million?) ? Will I bring about the end of all fiat currencies (can’t even put a number on that— usd would be worthless). Or even will it become a forgotten Novelty(target price - .01 usd

Two reasons:
One- In the traditional banking system, your money (up to 250k) is insured against the company going bankrupt. In bitcoin, there is no legal requirement of that. If the company holding your bitcoin goes bankrupt, then you might get your money back. If you hold your bitcoin in your wallet, you know they are safe.
Two- if you want to send/spend them, you have to ask the company holding them to do it. If there are in your wallet, you just do it.
To set up the mobile wallet, read some reviews to find one you trust. I have used several but am using Coinomi right now. I have heard great things about BRD though. But when it comes to wallets don’t trust random links on the internet... people have downloaded fakes before and lost all their money.
Then you download it. Create a new wallet (depends on the app how). 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ! Save the list of words it gives you. Those seed words ARE your money. If you have those you can access it anywhere... if someone else has those words they have your money! Imagine that for a second... your money is as accessible as cash anywhere in the world you go. 
Now the easy part! Then send the money to that address from coinbase. It’s as easy as scanning a qr code.

Because people are apparently being hostile to you, probably through PM I guess since there aren’t enough comments to care, I will explain why.
For people who have either experienced or looked at data about the growth of bitcoin since the beginning, it’s pretty clear about the patterns it has followed in the past. It could be different this time... but expecting things to be different without a basis for that is like wondering why your girlfriend cheated on you for the 6th time.
Bitcoin has been following a pattern oscillating around a trend line ever since it became tradable for dollars. It slowly rises overtime, then new people hear about it because the price is rising. Those people don’t understand much about it, they Only know “others” are making money. They buy enough to make them uncomfortable. The price continues rising to ~10x the ath they buy more. Now they are nervous that they could lose it all because “it’s a bubble! , beanie babies, tulips, Ponzi”. It dips 10% in an hour and they fear the worst and dump it so they get out before ”everyone else dumps.”
Now btc is slightly higher than it was before all the newbs bought last time. And it flatlines for a while. Then it repeats except everything is 10x larger numbers. 10x faster rise. 10x larger drops each weekend. 10x as many people who don't remember this and expect it to move like last time.
But that's the simple version. This time ” it will be different ” 
1) the news will be cautious for a while... People will remember that they followed the advice on tv and lost money. It won't be news until 15-20k. At 50k they will lose their minds again and say dumb things and trigger serious fomo again
2) btc will be talked about on the 3rd or 4th debate by Andrew Yang. The only candidate who understands it even a little. 
3) fidelity, etrade, etc. Are going to open up the floodgates to peoples IRAs 
4) more hedge funds will get in and play mr whale God.
Basically in Reddit terms...

There is a presidential candidate proposing a vat to tax consumption. He has not quite come out to say this, but reading between the lines he want to start with a simple value added tax that takes 10% of the increase in value at each stage of the production process. From his more detailed statements he then later wants to Modify it to target gains made from automation that are reducing wages and eliminating jobs. 
I feel like you might agree with that part... the next part perhaps not. He wants to take this revenue and then give $1000 to every citizen over 18 each month. They have to opt in and forgo any other cash and cash like government payments (snap, disability, etc.) in order to drastically reduce poverty while lowering the cost of welfare by reducing the overhead required to run the programs.  This would be a net benefit for anyone that spends less than 120k a year. Basically it is an incredibly progressive way to do what you suggested while minimizing complexity. If you spend more than 120k a year your tax bill goes up. If you spend less your net tax bill goes down.
According to his data, ( which makes intuitive sense at least, but I can’t find his actual data) this would provide a huge boost to local economies (for a pop of 100k, it would be 1.2 million a month), lead to greater entrepreneurship ( I know the only thing stopping my wife from quitting her job and starting a small biz is that we currently need 2 incomes), and reduce the cost of our welfare programs as the automation revolution puts a lot of unskilled laborers out of work ( automation will create new jobs... the people who will lose theirs won’t be qualified).
It’s both an incredibly leftist ideal but implemented in a hugely libertarian way. It also addresses how to make up for income tax shortfall as the massive shift in employment needs will both create shortages for some industries while unemploying millions of people over the next 5-10 years in transportation, retail, and other things you would not expect. 
I teach computer science in junior high and we have spent 6 weeks each semester for the last 5 years talking about technological unemployment. I always surprises me how much more easily 13 year olds understand technological unemployment then 40 year olds... and then I realize self driving cars are not new too them, they have been around since they were 2. Some 40 year olds still think self driving cars will never work and refuse to use self checkouts. Advanced versions of Self driving trucks and self checkouts can replace ~30% of the American work force.

Is that where the wind shifts directions and floods all the lambos into the ocean?
Edit for those who don't know: a monsoon is when prevailing wind patterns shift and moist air from the ocean starts blowing inland. It often brings very heavy rain. Common on the Indian subcontinent and the American southwest. Phoenix will get 70 percent( made up exaggerated number) of yearly rainfall in two days during a monsoon.
This is often incorrectly confused with a typhoon...

Sales tax is incredibly regressive... that would mean that poor people would pay a much larger percentage of their income in taxes.
 I would be more in favor of a flat tax than just sales taxes.
To be completely fair, investment gains should be taxed higher than income. I mean how much work did you really do for that money if all you did was hodl? Now compare that to actual work. Which one do you think should have higher taxes on it?
This is why fidelity trading bitcoin will be massive. Think if everyone with an ira will be able to sell their mutual funds to buy bitcoin instead. Even though it has an absurd premium, I have more gbtc than I have btc because I can hold it in a Roth IRA tax free.

Not saying what I would do, or what you should do, I will merely pose an analogous situation.
You order a box of socks from amazon. You are expecting them to arrive by Tuesday. On Tuesday evening you call amazon and complain. They agree to send you another box of socks with faster shipping. Wednesday a box of socks shows up. Thursday a box of sock shows up. They may request you send it back. 
The same situation with a usd transfer would have a clear answer. They would just suck the dollars out of your account. For many the immutability is a feature of bitcoin. They can’t just suck the bitcoin back. For others they are concerned about how to solve problems like yours (among others)
Did you steal those socks? Do you need to return them? Are the answers to those two the same or different?
The business made a mistake. Did they give you any instructions or expectations on what they were doing to solve it? They might have written it off as a cost of doing business... they might have also thought they were doing replace by fee. The safest thing is to sit on it for a few days at least until you hear from them. 
If you have a larger moral grey area than others... they can’t force you to give those bitcoin back without a lawsuit. And the courts would ( if they find against you) likely award the usd value of the bitcoin at the time of the transfer.
If you consider your self a good and nice person, then contact them and offer to send it back minus the transaction fee.

Imagine how I felt in 2017 when I started hearing about bitcoin again... and then the kicker... my very untechsavvy wife in early November 2017 asked me, “ so what is bitcoin and should we get some.” And we were broke because she has just found a new job after being unemployed for a stretch.
But on the bright side, we are no longer broke all of the time, she has a better job, and I’m finally able to get back in at the end of the bear market. I’m up to .03.
Have a plan to get to 1 by the time the big run up starts (I think feb 2021 it runs from 20k - 97k in December 2021). Followed by crash to 40k in Jan then 25k over a year. Hopefully retire with 2btc in 2024 and a price of 1mil. 
Ive been calculating returns based on different times in btc history assuming holding for at least 3 years. Just about the worst possible time to have bought would have been at the top before the mt gox crash. You still would have gotten 34% annual return holding until this April... 3 times better than the average growth in stocks. Even assuming the growth slows significantly over time, by 2034 btc either goes back to near zero or goes over 1 million. I’ve got a much more detailed analysis that I’m working on to post soon.
