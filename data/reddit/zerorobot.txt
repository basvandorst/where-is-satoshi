I need to educate myself more on LN, but if this could actually solve Bitcoin's current quagmire of slow transactions and crazy high fees then it would be amazing! 
How far off are we from starting to see a larger adoption of LN that would actually make the fees come down significantly?

I certainly agree here, they took a very strong position around the scaling debated (blocksize primarily) and alienated a large part of the ecosystem by doing that. Part of the argument was that in was unnecessary because of other scaling solutions. Not delivering on those would mean that they left us out to dry. Not saying they owe us anything but it would certainly be questionable behavior.

People will voice their concerns about what they think is important. This seems to be important to a lot of people. 
Maybe you do not agree, but that does not mean other needs to stfu about it.

Right now it is only Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:30
I do view it as a currency. I have business that uses Bitcoin and relies on transactions with Bitcoins. 
It is very frustrating right now. My business can’t function with these kind of fees and long transaction times. A couple of years ago Bitcoin was all about replacing VISA. Now its all about... what really? Speculation of price?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:27:24
Good point. I actually try to use my Bitcoins, guess that puts me in a minority group :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:02
This seems reasonable, fees are through the roof and it makes no sense to do small transactions on the Bitcoin network at the moment.
It seems like this could force a lot of business over to Bitcoin Cash unless solved.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:39
Historical reasons. It has worked very well up until now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:25
You are probably correct, I mentioned Bitcoin Cash mostly because they say they will add it as an smaller fee alternative;
”Bitcoin Cash payments will allow us to re-enable payments as small as $1 or smaller. ”
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:50
At least that implies that Bitcoin keeps its value :)
My concern is that the value (price) will drop significantly when users figure out that they can hardly use it. A transaction now costs upwards $20-30 and takes hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:56:19
High fees and long transaction times is a problem these days. I wonder why this is not a big topic in this sub?
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:51:34
Maybe not the biggest news, but the site I usually play at just added bitcoin as payment method. Thought it was nice =)
They seem to use Coinpayments for payments, what is the general opinion on them here?

I agree with this. There are good arguments to defend the energy usage but the author is trying to make a really weird point here. It feels like he did not think this one through all the way.

I would also vote for Nitrogen. They have been around for a very long time and are trustworthy.

Checked it out, looks perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for helping out =)
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:49:10
This is the correct answer. You went against their rules. From the thread it sounds you would want to use a crypto only sportsbook.
@_date: 2019-12-09 09:58:42
Thank you for your detailed response. Breez seems to be non-custodial which I like. But TBH when I think of it I might be ok with custodial as this will be for smaller amounts for day-to-day spending.
I also want to use it to be able to demo lightning-payments for clients. Given that, which wallet would you say is the easiest to use and would showcase simplicity best?
\*Edit: I think I cannot use a TestFlight app for demo purposes so Breez is probably out until they have a proper release =/
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:47:51
Me too. If you want to gamble in crypto, use a 100% crypto site.
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:25:25
I went with Wallet of Satoshi. I want to demo lightning to other people so the simple interface is great for that
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:23:27
Two billion people don't have a bank account. In some countries less than 15% of the population has banking. While I do agree that making Bitcoin easier to use and content with credit cards is a good thing, don't forget that there is a lot of people out there that could benefit from Bitcoin as an option to banking. A large part of this demographics still has a mobile phone and data.
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:34:18
Thanks. Is the wallet custodial or are my private key and wallet with me? Not sure how this works for Lightning wallets lol
@_date: 2018-11-10 14:53:05
I am also using Wirex now. The only bad thing for me is that the Bitcoin to Fiat conversion is not at the time of the purchase. So you have to manually convert from Bitcoin to Euro \*before\* you plan on making your purchase. Coinsbank, Xapo etc. had conversion at purchase time which was awesome, because then I would be holding Bitcoins until I spend them, but they don't have any card going right now so not much to do about that I suppose.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:52:25
I complete agree with your point about being free. OP's post is something straight out of He wants someone to spend time and money on implementing a payment solution to fits his requirements and then expects to pay zero for that work. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:19:33
Will do. It looks like they offer Mastercard (instead of VISA). Are you using them yourself? 
Give me your referral link if you want - makes no difference to me =)
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:23:03
Hmmm it doesn't say anything about Bitcoin deposits. I would guess that they will not hold Bitcoins even if possible(?)
They also got a terrible rating on Trustpilot -  I will look into it a bit more but it looks a bit wonky tbh.
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:03:06
I know it is not aligned with the core values of Bitcoin. But I need to be able to buy stuff in physical stores and a BTC debit card allows me to hold more of my funds in BTC and longer. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:20:39
Most customer facing companies in my country prefer to use credit cards over cash since cash has a larger overhead in getting the money into their bank account. Similar with Bitcoin where you need to setup processes and possibly convert into fiat into your bank - that creates a cost to the company.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:07:30
Thank you taking your time with this explanation, but I think this is way to much of an opinion article than anything else. 
You continuously resort to ad-hominem and speculation about the intrinsic motivation of other actors. Thus it just comes off as biased and immature article to me at least. 
I am sure there are very good arguments against 2x, but you dilute them by your use of mud-slinging.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:16:24
Thank you for a well written post! I have a question regarding the whole 2X debacle.
I think that whenever people are involved, it is virtually impossible to separate the people from the more technical virtues being discussed. It seems to me quite obvious that a lot of the schisms at hand is because of people problem and generally bad communication (and an unwillingness to understand the other side).
However, disregarding any loss of face etc. *if* core came out and said something like; 


Would not that invalidate both 2x and bitcoin cash (in a way) and thus cement Bitcoin core's position here? As well as calm the waters around the whole thing, which I assume would be a generally a very good thing (i.e. stability = good).

Congrats for the opening! How many people have paid in total? I.e. what percentage has paid with crypto?
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:36:22
Are you in US or EU? I am in EU and  I am currently using Wirex. It works ok, the app and manual conversion is a bit clunky but it works. It's a great way for me to be able to use BTC when traveling. Other EU cards that looks ok would be Bitwala and Trastra, i have ordered a Trastra card just to try out.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:16:02
How many people are paying with crypto vs fiat?
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:19:16
No I was asking what percentage of your customers have paid using crypto (vs paid in fiat)? Example; if you have 100 paying customers and 2 paid with crypto then the number is 2%.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:47:36
It could indeed become a very good environment for startup and entrepreneurs around cryptos to thrive which could benefit the whole country.

FTFY ;)
Most of the world is actually very used to thinking in SI units like millimeter, kilogram etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:56:18
From Bitcoin's perspective this is a great idea. Having separate currencies like 'Bitcoin Cash' etc just confuses users and dilutes the brand Bitcoin all together.
However, from a Bitcoin Cash perspective it might be sub-optimal. I guessing they can derive value from being associated by name with the Bitcoin heritage they have.
If the forking and naming continuous like this then it will be a extremely difficult future for users.

Technically, Bitcoin is inflationary because the supply of Bitcoin increases over time. Right now about 1,800 BTC is created every day.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:48:58
I think most of the resistance to SI units comes from US users. They are not used to metric prefixes and perceive it as 'weird'. Just my perception of it though.
Personally I think milli/micro is the way to go. Starting to come up with your own naming schemes is how we ended with the dreadful inches/feet/chain/furlong system in the first place ;)

It seems that the core of his argument is that Bitcoin has hit bottom and therefore is a safe investment (as it won't go down further). How can you know that Bitcoin has hit bottom though? Just because a valuation drops by 70% doesn't mean it can't drop another 70%. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:50:50
Sure, I agree that another 70% drop is unlikely. But my main point is that his base premise that Bitcoin has hit bottom is far from certain.
