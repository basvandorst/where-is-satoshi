Ok, did you read this?
It's worst than i thought following OPs initial post... *In reality, we have protection in place to prevent us from losing money due to all bugs similar to this one*...
 The response is by the director of "Engineering". Who claims there are safeguards at a higher level to prevent leakage..
like i do with the pipes in my sink when i don't want to bother buying a new one... Alternatively i could pay the plumber who pointed it out before the whole fucking pipe explodes and water goes everywhere... 
Op clearly explains that there are several issues.. The mere fact you can have negative balances leads to a TON of other issues. Now if these issues result in losses on your part.. and you cover clients losses.. lol all the better, but you'll likely find elaborate schemes to ban the client, place the blame on them, and then use your "bureaucracy" (* And plus, the team that works with banning has no access or knowledge of the hackerone cases. This separation protects our customers' privacy.*) to make it impossible for that client to get his money/account back
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:10:13
The point is OP could have robbed you of millions, probably doesn't give a shit about your scammy service, but at the very least whether he be some sketchy russian hacker hiding out in thailand doing tons of illegal transactions or whatever, if he reported this kind of bug to you when he could have just drained you of the coins you steal from all your customers ... then he should get a reward.

Every company built to "provide" a service to bitcoin, and that assumes the status of "company/corporation" due to local registration is scummy.
Bitcoin is a self-managed technology, sure we can use services as training wheels while the technology is being developed to provide services that can't be done right now on top of btc, but to go out of your way and register it like a regular company which centralizes control to you, and imposes sanctions based on your biased interpretation/not proven events or transactions on top of that technology, destroys the enticing ideas behind btc. It looses all its value .... to me at least.
The least a company like this should do is provide you a chance to prove how much you can affect it, if you say millions then prove it, and then they reward you with a %age of that based on the amount of time they would take to fix it.

That sounds like a horrible idea, if you want something different, just fork the blockchain, don't couple individual decisions to a client side vote. 
IMO the blockchain should be as conceptually simple as needs to be and it's details hard constants voted on outside of the blockchain, and then implemented/modified/in the code. The choice would then be yours to mine one or the other fork of btc.
The idea is so simple, why create a new insecure mechanism where everyone *votes* individually.... it's exactly what goes on right now, in a very secure manner, although there's a shit tone of spam everywhere by the more vocal supporters of this or that feature, in the end, the decision is that of the miners. Simply those who work the hardest get the most say in what happens.

Just a suggestion: 
Maybe get a fancier looking (more graphical) one made for the key points?
Limit those to 3 points as well
something like:
- [question mark image] ask to pay in bitcoin
   +  sub text in smaller font: make sure you have enough, and internet is accessible.
- [some symbol to represent price convertion] quote your price in bitcoin with bitcoinaverage.com
   + tips are still payed in CAD, unless otherwise cited
- [some food image] Enjoy your meal
   + no returns in bitcoin
that point about quoting price in bitcoin made me think of a cool app: one that would read prices off the camera and automaticallly convert the menu's prices to bitcoin.

been following since 2011,
too much trolling and manipulation this time around, we'll get over it but it's really damaging to the community and price of bitcoin.
the inflow of people mining alternate currencies all dumping to BTC then cash immediately to cover their investment also are causing more BTC to be sold and downward pressure for the price. It used to be people would hold knowing ASICs would lead to price increase.
Then again the next gen of ASICs is coming maybe that'll have the same effect as last fall? 
Also, once the price gets low enough, big buyers who don't have access OTC deals will be able to buy their thousands of BTC on the market and that might instantiate a rally.
But crucial point is trolls have to hold, because the inflation right now of coins mined is HUGE, it's hard to imagine the price is even justified right now... if some whale decides to indulge ... we'll feel the pain.

I'll add that to the collection of responses i've had. 
Which are WRONG.
Now i'll let you find the tickets i've opened... many of which have been closed, and contained screenshots as well as detailed explanations of the problem.
You will see in those screen shots my 740 XPM balance, that is NOT NEGATIVE, there is NO NEGATIVE SIGN IN FRONT OF 740 XPM.
That is POSITIVE 740 XPM. I've explained it again here.
I've lost about 5 h today with you. Just find the tickets and figure it out.
What you describe above is YET ANOTHER BUG by cryptsy. That  bug should NOT exist on a site dealing with money, but it doesn't concern me much, i wont be using you guys anyways knowing you so casually fix bugs and ignore them.... what does concern me is that my 740XPM disappeared.

Bitcoin is not economics.
Sure, maybe in a few years they'll be able to understand how bitcoin works, but until then it's a new asset class, it's nor a good or service. It doesn't resemble anything they've studied. It's nothing like the corrupt economic system they've created. It's not something they can manipulate just yet. Not economists  anyway.
It's a  decentralized asset, whose available supply depends on code, as well as many factors, and whose demand is at the whim of users. It operates like a free market. I bet most 4chan users could give more useful information on these interviews than most of the economists.
Time and again they have been WRONG. 3 years ago, i felt put down when they laughed at me calling it glorified digital monopoly money, last year i regained confidence and laughed when they were calling Bitcoin bullshit, and all this year, i laughed when they started praising it (cf. professor bitcoin for the most blatant example). Each time i put money on it, and so far so good ;).

Some, maybe, 
But i think it's just people get excited on good news and put large buy orders just below the current price, and whales who might need cash see these walls as an opportunity to cash out.
Then others see loads of coins being dumped and panic sell. Add to that the hedging bets some are making and you get accelerated slumps in the market following good news.
Adversely, no news at all is usually a good opportunity for bitcoin to rise.

if you can use it to run a programming language with it, then it's turing complete. 
Basically the idea is that it'll be able to run on the blockchain/within the transactions (i don't know yet, but that's how i understood what they're trying to do). In either case i think it gives too much potential for attacks and worms to be created etc.
i could imagine one tx that had a miner coded into it, mining this coin then sending itself as a new tx on the same block chain. or something like that heh. then Ddosing the ethereum blockchain from within with tx's paid for by the parent miner..etc. All is possible with a turing complete language ;) of course all this is unrealistic speculation since i have no idea what they've coded yet, and this is probably stuff they've taken into account.
edit: ddossing = denial of service, basically bloating the network with transactions. And killing it. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:42:24
i disagree, 
Bitcoin breaks the corporate dominance by allowing individuals a chance to compete in a new, unbiased financial landscape. It does that by providing the technological tool and ability for anyone to join in.
Centralized hubs like coinbase work in the opposite direction of bitcoin by contacting Currently "dominant" corporations and offering them a chance to set a foot in the door to the cryptocurrency world. 
If you want your paycheck in bitcoin, just buy bitcoin when you receive it. You can buy it from someone on a forum, an exchange, or wherever...
coinbase goes after companies and tries to lure them in to be the dominant middleman to the cryptoworld, taking a commission on every transactions, which will likely rise as they continue monopolize the corporate world's access to a live exchange. Instead of simply educating companies about accepting bitcoin and leaving their own teams to figure it out.

That's a good question, someone probably did the math already..
And although the Buzzword when this question is asked is always "impossible" i'd like to know the details mining vs breaking ECDSA well, maybe can help
Also QC can break ECDSA, this has been discussed: imagine you invest X amount of money in building top of the [quantum computers]( instead of that same amount in mining ASIC.. apparently you can break ECDSA and and therefore get the privkey from the public key. But these don't do well for hashing/mining i think?
I mean you could invest X money, or gain access to a QC lab etc...
Then again, upon news of a compromised key and movement on the exchanges the price would dive to 0 so quickly you probably will scramble to make 1/1000th of a profit. but it could still be porfitable

Well, in 2013-2014 they started inviting more tech people to talk about the technology.
Then in 2014 they botched it again, completely now, either because some of these tech people got corrupt and ended up being obsessed with making money, or by inviting representatives of "bitcoin foundation" or "bitcoin embassy" or any other well marketd "legit sounding" organization. And  anyother professional scammers using bitcoin to carry out their scams. 
Whoever can make the most noise, and talk better than they can listen.  Or those that can summarize a technology by looking at headlines such as on reddit. 
Unfortunately these are the people that end up reusing R values instead of those that end up finding out how to exploit that.
They still do invite economists from time to time but not as much as before, before media was like "who the fuck do i call up for an interview on this.. oh i know Professor Bitcorn from Harvton university".

Whose feeding politicians all this BS about bitcoin?
Obviously their job is just to call the shots but someone is influencing their decision. The media (which we as reddittors) can influence, should emphasize important consequences to choking off bitcoin:
- providing the enemy/competitor a motivation to invest in the currency,  
=&gt; sort of what happened when US government was still iffy on coins last fall
- set back evolution in the already monotonously dated banking system
- isolate the country from the rest of the world, and lag behind! 
=&gt; this happened to france in the 90s when they didn't want to let go of their "minitels" and follow the rest of the world's adoption of the internet. 
Now if the intent of the government is just to close down big exchanges, that might not be all bad, because i believe these big exchanges are just  using bitcoin as an opportunity to become banks of the new bitcoin world. Bitcoin should be acquired the way it was intended to be acquired: OTC or mining.

I say bitcoin is amazing as a technology, it's because I see it as a great way to automate human actions (through incentive) to benefit solving computational problems, in a distributed manner. Specifically, synchronizing a ledger amongst all parties in the case of bitcoin.
This "reward" is part of the technology. 
I won't go over why it should be classified as a currency, from all the lists i've seen in youtube videos it seems to satisfy the necessary qualities of it. 
As I say above, currency or not, it has to have "value" to miners, at least, for the technology to function.

Mobile doesn't require 2fa, so pretty much all your security out the window. Someone just needs to log in to your lastpass account on their phone with the pass they logged from you. This is a huge seucirty issue, my ticket has not been resolved it's been more than a few months.
edit: To be more specific, the safe thing to do is to disable lastpass access on mobile. But it's ultimately not a solution... also, still the secure note problem, and pretty much everywhere you need to enter your password it doesn't ask for 2fa which is stupid..

The way i see it is that it allows two generals to keep synchronized.
If the general can verify independantly (hashing does not require a network) then you can verify that this "blockchain" of events, is in order. 
The work required to "find the hash" is significant, also that means that to create the blocks in the chain you require the majority of generals to trust you and add this block to their chain. The blocks are sequential by concensus (block chain with most blocks is taken as "The chain"), this means that you require (and will mostly not have) no FORKS (no blocks that break the sequence), you have a constant consencus.  This means you have an independantly synchronized network of generals (Network without what we probably understand to be a network...as in no communication to synchronize).  If they all leave the base camp with the same "genesis block" and keep mining messages, verifying with 6 neighbooring generals only, they will all build on the same block chain. and keep synchronized.
If a spy decides to defect, he will need to convince the majority of generals to follow him, or his block chain will not be used as "The" blockchain. On top of that, if the enemy wants to mess up the message they need to remine everything from the genesis block, which means they need way more mining gneerals to do all that work.
The hashes however can be quickly verified, so the generals can verify the blockchain and see that they are synced and decide to trust a message that says "attack on block 1234" for example, then they will continue mining until that block, and when it happens, they will attack.
It's possible for there to be forks (there was one in early 2013 on the bitcoin blockchain i believe), but in most cases, there wont be, and you can trust each party. When there are, you just prune the rogue chain, and ignore the insane general - this is why this is a "in most cases/99.largenumberof9's %" situation, and not a provable solution.
Personally i see this as mind blowing. Every time.

Ya, exactly like the world works on a greater scale. 
Bitcoin was created to remedy the problem with this corrupted greater scale.
If a business wants to figure out bitcoin they shouldn't have a single central place to look for it, else many richer businesses will invest in it faster than the greater bulk of the population has time to adopt it, and you have a new (albeit different) corrupt hierarchy for the same kind of centralization.
these "consulting businesses" just want to suck up the "early bird" bonus of gaining businesses trust, and reaping the juicy commission. Don't be fooled.

you believe yourself (cryptsy) to be an undeniably trustable authority, but you've said above several times that your systems were not capable of handling the inflow of users.
You've admitted to a plethora of bugs, (all not pertaining to the one i described, which incidentally could probably be used to exploit your site, and i believe i saw a post recently that detailed how to do that). And you refuse to pay attention to complaints.
I ask you to repeat the operations i've done that night 14th december in the same environment, and you will see for yourself. What you are doing and have done is just sent information that could too easily be manipulated, but i am not alone, there are hundreds of victims of your scam.

Perfectly timed manipulation on the part of MTGox, this news comes as the 3 day MACD happens, (exponential average crosses the average bitcoin price), it hadn't crossed since early 2013, so big movement was to be expected.
You can see it on the 3day chart on bitcoinwisdom, the blue line and brown line crossing, this is a BIG sign for automated trading bots to make a move, in this case the exponential average (indicating the latest movement trend) went below the average, this means the trend is downwards.
So MTgox preps up their sells, sets a weekend climate of "some big news is about to come out on monday, everyone keep an eye on your coins"
Then DROPS the bad news, and BOOM goes the dynamite. we have an epic crash.
Meanwhile MTgox sets up its orders on BTC-E around 200.
edit: FYI MACD is a classic indicator used by simple bots, especially on BTC-e.
edit2: i see all these big important Exchange people playing the good guys on this subreddit, but i don't like most of  them one bit. 
They either take monstruous comissions, or act like idiots and have incompetent exchanges (such as Cryptsy, who stole 740 XPM from me due to horribly coded website/trade engine). I think bitcoin is about NOT depending on a third party, and these exchanges are just playing the role of banks, except at least with a bank you can get some sort of insurance for your trade. Not with these exchanges. So the best way to deal bitcoin imo is to mine it or if you just want to buy, buy person to person or accept it for some work.
Obviously they do offer easier access for some... but we should strive towards abandonning these types of exchanges. (for coin to coin exchanges i really like most distributed exchange solutions, colored coin, bitshares, etc.)

How about we do this on the open forum, did you read my post above? i've contact you guys and i'm sure you're a new tech support agent, i've contcted a dozen of you about this. 
The issue is simple, i had 740XPM in my balance, and they disappeared in front of my eyes on cryptsy.
i did NOTHING, no trades/withdrawals at the time at which they disappeared. Of course i figured out another bug which could have caused this which i detailed to your team of dev's several times.
My tickets started disappearing as well, the ones with the "official" screen shots taken by your tool disappeared first, thankfully i saved screen shots on my computer.
You guys claimed it was due to another bug. I'm tired of Cryptsy bull shit and if you think this as far as i'll go with negative publicity for you guys, just wait until i actually have some time to do it. 
You stole 740XPM from me, if you don't kno what i'm talking about ask your colleagues. I'm sure they know, or search bitcointalk for 740 and you'll find more details.
But don't fucking come here trying to make it look like you'll attempt to resolve this issue until you actually do.
edit: here is my XPM address: ANEtn2F3zGvZkMQKCCHHQdgbLJjs3zpiuK you wanna do your job? stop asking the same question and blaming it on new 'random problems' and do your own research i've written an encyclopedia on your bug and i'm tired. Through the ticketing system, bitcointlak forum, etc. i've almost always mentioned it was 740 XPM lost. Send the XPM to that address.  Sang (on BTctalk) also was robbed by you guys a similar amount, by the same bug (we saw it happening live on the 14th december night).

yes, there could be a site that offers an API to check affiliation with these coins by looking up the blockchain, and allows receivers to decide whether they want to accept or deny the transaction.
Calling out the person using these. It's a distributed/consensus effort hopefully someone with more influence (bitcoin foundation?) offers such a service.  It's easy to do.

Edit: For reference, and because he's a coward probably working for cryptsy, this is what user: wrote above, which i am replying to:
[–]coins1204 1 point 8 minutes ago
*Missing out on trades because the exchange lagged doesn't make them a scam.
I've done hundreds of trades on Cryptsy and yes, I've had many problems with them. Most of the time, the issues were corrected automatically but every other time I simply opened a ticket and things were fixed within a few days.*
That is absolutely NOT the problem i had.
You are doing the same thing cryptsy is:
- blame another bug or problem on my complaint.
My problem is that my trades went throgh and were noted correctly for hours: i was buying @ 5, selling @ 6, i even have screen shots, and invited them to replicate the environment on their side to see for themselves.
They refused.
 Anyways, after a bunch of trades where my balance increased, i looked around on cryptsy, then mysteriously saw my balance first halfing then going negative.
THAT IS A BUG.
When you deal with thousands of dollars worth of goods, i don't give a shit if you need to build a fucking barbie house for your girl (the excuse bitjohn gave when i asked for assistance around the 20th of december).
You need to attend to your clients.

It's normal to have bugs, but refuse to admit and try to fix them, that's incompetence.

I agree, as a CS grad, there is too much marketing around this coin.
Turnig complete is a buzzword. I see a turing complete language on a block chain is like putting a rolls royce engine on your bike when it's still got training wheels.
The guys behind it seem to have the right intentions but ... this is ridiculous. We can do so much, an infinite amount of things with bitcoin as it is right now, and we have barely uncovered the tip of the iceberg.
Why not make it better first? I'm all about innovation, and i support the ethereum project because it is bold and definitely will bring insight on problems with having such an infrastructure on the blockchain. But honestly i don't think it's the best way to solve the problems they claim it will solve.
I don't know how they're implementing it but..following the fuss we've had with malleability with a non-turing complete language, i got a feeling this is going to be a HUGE problem with a turing complete language on top of ethereum

I'm all for bitcoin and crypto in general.
But following the trouble i went through with Cryptsy stealing my money (yes they stole 740 XPM from me) and saying that "coins are not money", i sort of wish the SEC clarified this issue, and how people like me can deal with getting their money back.
I think it's cool we have more exchanges available now by anyone who wants to create one, but it makes sense to me that in order to be able to retrieve lost funds or stolen funds as was the case with cryptsy stealing a ton of money from everyone, and eventually this MT. gox deal, there should be clarification on how this is handled. 
So ya, downvote this because you want there to be a wild wild web here, but i for one am all for technology, distributed exchanges would be perfect because they should in principle be logically sound.... something like cryptsy is shitful of bugs. They all are.

I disapprove of the foundation, the only thing i know of it is that it is a central entity often referenced as representing bitcoin, and speaking for it. 
I think they do some good things too apparently (fund developers?..etc.) but i don't like the idea of automatically christening new members based on substantial donations. 
Anything donated should be completely anonymous and not reflect membership to an association representing Bitcoin.
affiliation to such an association should be based on contributions and importance (freely decided by community) of these (like developers on github, personal work done to promote or explain bitcoin correctly etc.)
Similarly: I'm always baffled in cryptoforums to see "donators" get the full 5 stars of trust... It's the same thing in this case.

despite being so elusive, their practices so far have been legitimate. I understand OP's conversation as "we're going to lock down your account to figure out whats wrong" or perhaps a message lost in translation.
Cryptsy  is another exchange that is COMPLETELY illegitimate, and they are in your face about it. After stealing 740XPM from me, i've been told directly by Bitjohn that it's not money. 
This was due to a bug which i specified, took screen shots, and pursued for over a month, but i have not been reimbursed. These guys are huge scammers, they operate in plain light. i would be very careful with them.
BTC-e is justified in keeping its whereabouts secret, they hold so much and might not have access to the necessary protection in eastern europe. I'd wait it out op. Hell it's not even the 17th of february where i am yet :P if it doesn't get fixed, then you obviously have the option of doing a chargeback.

my last [post]( about lastpass not attending to my ticket got downvoted, i'm going to try again:
Lastpass 2FA only required during login to lastpass plugin on chrome, you can ask for the masterpassword to be requested during access to passwd vault or secure notes, but 2fa is not requested, this is a security flaw:
Your computer is compromised, hacker installs keylogger and now has access to your master password, the attacker can get access to your vault and all the passwords in it, or to your secure notes, while you look away. (something similar happened to a er during his sleep, and the hacker was playing around his pc with a R.A.T for example).
It would be not only more convenient, but definitely more secure to require 2FA during access to Secure notes or password vault instead of asking for master password again (which is just exposing the user to more keylogging if he wasn't "compromised" before).
Even better: every time you need to log in to any site, requiring 2FA would be extremely convenient (for example i would just press my yubikey button).
This is not perfect: it gives the hacker an opportunity each time 2FA is entered to compromise your account before you etc. but i think overall it's more secure, and makes it more complicated for the hacker. 
PLEASE, instead of down voting, reply with why this may not be more secure.

Bitcoin cannot be stopped, it will not go to zero, that is a garantee.
As long as there are humans alive who have used it before it will not go to zero. 
Yes, in theory it's possible that everyone ceases to use it, and i've been arguing the same thing as you to everyone: either 10 00 or 0, but i've changed my mind.
The original reason bitcoin was interesting beyond the technological novelty, is that it stimulated investors greed by giving them an easy way to make money, all the while supporting the technology itself! This has not stopped and there are now more easy ways to make money, from altcoin mining to ponzi schemes to what not...
People will find ways to quench their greed (greed is natural, not a bad thing).
I agree that too many people are jumping on board that have nothing to do with bitcoin and try to manipulate it the old fashion way or try to make money with it by promoting their business through it, and i don't like that either... these people should stick to their toilet paper money, until they understand how this is beneficial as more than just a tool they can convert to cash instantly..

Besides, exchanges are essentially the new Banks in the bitcoin world, we should heed them, and trade bitcoin person to person the way i twas meant to be traded.

Coinbase like elitism is anti decentralization. Coinbase is the biggest success of the corporate centralized world, but it is the biggest failure and enemy of the decentralized world.

All exchanges are taking advantage of the inflow of n00bs to this business to make their own rules; high fees, slow verification, 
and in the case of Cryptsy: exploiting fame to steal coins from innocent traders, blaming it on bugs, then going on an eternal goose chase to run a Bugged "audit script" .. working on the premise that their trade engine is not screwed up, when it's shit.
They are really the ones being their own banks from that point of view ;)

but ... but... but what about the blockchain?
Without competition bitcoin is at risk of becoming a monopoly as well. Miners who invested early and control the network will hoard for themselves all the coin in order to create their own form of "capital control", people who didn't invest early enough wont like that, jealousy is human nature.
This mostly applies to mining, as long as people will be greedy, and i don't think human nature is about to change, they will seek new ways to make money. Distributed currencies ... the altcoins and bitcoin.. based around mining prove that it's possible for a group of people to create this "verifiable asset", and hold it in order to rise the demand for it. Once the demand is high enough it's sold, in ways that will become even more decentralized as decentralized exchanges come to exist soon enough.
That is the main reason there will continue to be new alts. 
There are shit coins that will die due to the laziness of the devs/marketing/miners, but i'm not surprised if we keep on seeing a "back from the dead" cycle as has happened with a few coins that encountered technical or marketing issues. IE Megacoin before implementing kimoto well.
Coins will also become extremely useful as the algorithms and ledgers they keep have a meaningful purpose, be it primecoin, curecoin, ... DAC.. etc.
And finally, keeping only the bitcoin blockchain and using it as a back end for new layers of "distributed" technology means we'll be bloating it when it's just so easy to create a new coin.
Through Bitcoin, satoshi brought us the Blockchain technology. That is what holds the most merit from all his work. All the value, rumors, and BS like this article are speculations, by people with financial interest in the asset only... I'd ignore most of this.

I've been continuously ranting against cryptsy, this site is much more dangerous than MT. Gox, the team of developers there is clearly incompetent. Their "customer service" is incompetent as well.
Cryptsy has stolen 740 XPM from me at a time i would have cashed it out for 3000$. I am one of many victims of a bug that i clearly detailed to cryptsy since mid december. My incident took place on december 14th, there was at least one other person (Sang) on the forums who was a victim of this bug at the exact same time. It's a race condition combined with the plethora of other bugs including a rounding errors at the satoshi level, on cent coins which they are now closing.
The "defacto" response from customer service is: Blame users for being impatient, run a biased "audit" script that rounds things up in their favor whatever the bug. Ignore what you say, then if you try to reach the ops such as BitJohn,  and threaten further legal action they will argue: "it's not money" - BitJohn.
They have since kept giving the same response, and if this post gets their attention again (you can look at my reddit history for the last time i went over this with someone from cryptsy) you will see it again ;) i'm willing to bet 100 of these XPM (if they ever return it) that this wont be resolved.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:15:53
side note:
Cryptsy is a scam itself, their exchange has robbed me of over 740 XPM (worth 3 BTC/3 000$ at the time) and  i'm not the only one. 
In total, those that have contacted me due to the same problem we've lost around 10 000$ ( i don't want to take into account those i haven't seen, otherwise that number is much greater)
Big vern, bit john, etc. dont care.
The big red flag in the above message for me would have been Cryptsy.
Their exchange is crippled with bugs they dismiss as "normal", and they will not make the least effort to reimburse anyone affected by these. I've given proof, as well as a detailed explanation of the bug over 20 times to many people and posts, they couldn't give a shit.
Be careful, dont use cryptsy.

You guys are fucking pathetic and i hope my frustration shows in this post.

......you misunderstand my remark, where do i say 2FA is used for encryption?
2FA is used for authentication, but secure notes have the option of "requiring" the Master password for access, however not 2FA.
Furthermore, it's possible to require "strict" verification asking for Master password each time the password is entered automatically for site access.
The "master password" is not used for encryption either, it is used for authentication, however it's inconvenient and once it has been logged it's vulnerable.
Requiring 2FA for each credential access/secure note access does not secure the computer in case of a compromise, it makes it more difficult for the attacker to access all the passwords and content in the vault. Like i said above, it adds a layer of protection, and gives time for a compromised user to limit the damage. IE. he might have acquired my one exchange credentials and withdraws funds, but i can stop him from getting the rest with 2FA since he can't access the others without 2FA  (unless he's been there for a while and sees me access multiple accounts and i haven't noticed him)
However if without 2FA, simple access to the masterpassword gives him access to everything instantly.
Hopefully that cleared it up.

why do they always get economists to explain bitcoin when these guys have been trained to work with markets/tendencies skewed by a centralized banking system?
They often say the most BS as well. I would trust these guys if they were saying the same things about bitcoin in 2012.
edit: Bitcoin is a protocol, economists only understand the potential of this coin by looking at it's value and fluctuation. What they should include to explain bitcoin is a computer scientist. The best bitcoin interviews i've seen so far are interviews of CTOs and guys who understand the protocol:  and many more... I'm fairly convinced economists do not understand decentralization correctly.
edi2: You trolls have been downvoting me, but it seems i'm not the only one saying that economists see something else in bitcoin than the people who work with it, once again, bitcoin is so much more than a currency i believe it has no value, it's not an arm wrestling match with banks :

That is true, the internet is inherently not secure.. access is controlled by central server that can be circumvented: your password gets leaked from one site/cracked/you dont have any other security measures.. and boom your account is hacked.
Its not good to give confidence to people too fast, unfortunately if people start flooding the gates of bitcoin without knowing the risks, they will be putting their coins at risk, and losing it would drive them away once more. It's better to slow down adoption as much as possible now that bitcoin has reached the critical mass in the media and will keep having momentum.

That makes more sense; There is an offline local cache of the vault as a whole.
But that's an even bigger vulnerability in the design than i imagined then... 
If they were to make access to the individual credentials encrypted and stored on lastpass's servers, and only sending the required credential, once 2FA has been used.
If people want to risk keeping their vault for "offline access" it should be up to them. But it's a risk.

They have/had (probably still do) a race condition bug + rounding error bug on their trade engine, i was buying low/selling high (5 satoshi-6 satoshi) and everything seemed fine as my profit increased through the night.
After a few hours, my balance suddenly started halving and then going negative. I am not the only one this happened to, i was doing this trade on CENT/XPM there were other people (sang) and at least 5 more who claimed to have the same bug, this happened on december 14 2013.
I have since just made sure to bring it up at every opportunity, as i know eventually i will be able to pursue whatever legal action i can against these fraudsters.
The only "proof" i have was screen shots... which were taken by their screen shot system, which i backed up, and suddenly their ticket system "had a bug" and deleted all messages that week/month.

More than that, it went back around 1$ a few times in 2011.
Plenty of people in it back then. I personally was trying to figure out the technology and didn't massively buy back then though. The volatility was unlike anything i had seen before, and i didnt have much money to gamble anyways.. I was mining.
Then the first bubble came in may/june and that's when the first wave of madmen came in, then in 2012-2013 all the latecomers and n00bs flooded the ship.

It is, but i meant to suggest that the coins from the wallet were stolen some way or another, and possibly due to technical problems with how the wallet was made.

I didn't get into bitcoin so i could go through some payment processor scam like coinbase, bitpay, or any other payment processor thief.
I've seen a lot of hype from large companies "accepting" bitcoin through these processors recently but it is horrifying, the effect it will have is to just create a new pecking order for the distribution of digital currency, on a network of "virtual banks" that don't even have a sliver of the guarantees and insurances provided by regular banks. Albeit regular banks probably lose much more every day than these virtual ones, the fiat banks' insurances won't relay that loss to the individuals (some may reply with rare/unique examples, i won't reply with all the cases of centralized scams that caused millions in the cryptosphere, because you know them already).
By building this image of themselves as the "new banks" they're making people who get into bitcoin just now think they "Have" to use them.... i told my friend to open accounts on coinbase a year or two ago following a promotion they had so i could get them to try bitcoin, it was a huge mistake and i regret it. My friends ask me to send them bitcoins directly to their accounts, and juts don't pay attention when i explain to them that's not how you do bitcoin. I since then tell neophytes to use electrum, or armory or mycellium.
I will personally boycott any company that goes through these processors and encourage others to do so as well.

Wow, more info on his previous criminal/scam history?
I know some miners who bought the first batches of gridseeds through gaw, at a rebate, and had no regret, these were great apparently. I phoned him up as well at the time but he couldn't win my trust. (i detect scam by voice).
Later on his company still seemed legit as he sold hw, maybe once he hit cloud mining is when it turned to ponzi. This is similar to what LTC gear seemed to have done, however in my experience with LTC gear it was the lack of proper communication that put my significant order and funds in limbo for 3-4 months. Others seemed to be satisfied of it last year, but last couple of weeks i've been seeing a lot of accusations here too.

next one in line are the "futures" bucket shops and scam sites making a big hype and crashing bitcoin.
Probably mysteriously getting "hacked" and disappearing with people's coins. Or eaten up by some esoteric bugs.
In the immediate future (probably up to 2016-17) it will continue to lay low. It takes a distributed effort to bring bitcoin up, however there is no real "incentive" anymore to use of bitcoin as centralized entities control production as well as exchange of bitcoin, then dumping the price down for immediate profit. Instead of taking a long term risk in the creation of useful technologies on top of bitcoin. that make it interesting for people to use it. We'll see if people get working on these projects this year. 
Note: i personally am working on such technologies, i hope many others are.

Perfect solutions make perfect sense, the goal isn't to create a new fancy bank on some cool technology, it's to create a provable system.
marketers talking out of their ass about bitcoin and just complaining because that's their only way of "trying" to leave their mark.
If you want to create your new bank that farts gas or wtv 'cool' things new coins do these days, go make your own altcoin. 
Of course companies want to try to control bitcoin and continue having the biggest share, but that's against the very principle of bitcoin. 
Even if BTC somehow breaks because devs failed to scale, then perfect, people will leave, less transactions will happen, no more scaling problem, and bitcoin will recover soon enough minus all the cry babies.

It would be free to transfer that much in regular banks. Probably a lot more secure to access those as liquid money as well..

Do you know a lot of "DAO" investors with millions of dollars? 
What it looks like to me is some whales trying to leverage their pump and dumps to a larger scale, which might be created by the economy of the dao: few investors, similar volatility to ETHereum (something we've lost right now for BTC), much more liquid, much smaller Market cap but with all the same reasons to have a larger market cap that Ethereum promised.. I mean i'm not really pro ethereum but it is definitely going to be pump and dumpable for someone whose already made 10-20 M on eth pumps they're gonna have a hard time making more  but with this dao, if they invest a large amount in presale, and proper hyping they can probably move it significantly.

Apple made it impossible for my parents to sync family pictures on their 2006 imac by forcing updates that are not possible. They basically forced my mom to buy her 100$/month or whatever icloud service to now tell her she wont have access to her family pictures of my newborn nephew and niece because she did not sync the pictures soon enough, and made her believe they will 40gb of pictures will now disappear.

Cryptsy has stolen 740 XPM from me on december 14th i have been attempting to communicate with them through:
IRC, 
email, 
and the ticket system 
i sent tickets on the day it happpened that included screen shots of my balance and orders, the screen shots  tickets disappeared, they were closed without warninng.
I however backup the screen shots before that.
I collected a few emails of people who had the same problem as me, i am hoping to get enough people to pressure them into giving it back through negotiation.
If not, the amount we've lost together was worth at the moment over 50 000$ so it makes sense to pursue legal action. 
It has been over 1 week. 
If you have proof as well as had open tickets and similar issue, please contact.
My problem: I was buying CENT @ 5 satoshi XPM and selling it @ 6 satoshi XPM. The engine, the confirmations, my balance, everything was indicating that's what was happening.
However after a few hours, and a lot of trades, my balance started going down and went negative. It turns out their engine changed my trades, and inversed it to buying @ 6 and selling @ 5.
740 XPM lost for me (fistful_of_LTC), over 800 from sanghelli (irc)

Decide a scale of what can be considered "heavy load", when levels on that scales are reached raise the fee by a certain percentage. If you want to get fancy you can use automated solutions liek 
have a big warning on the trade tool that tells the user fee is increased due to heavy load. and recommend to slow down
The other solution is to make users wait a certain time between trades.
Or both.

pretty much but there could be a downside, maybe it doesn't apply to bitcoing because it's often converted to USD or other currencies.
If it's too expensive, it probably won't be practical?
Or does that not apply to bitcoins as it is similar to a commodity like gold.

I'm not an economist.
If you consider bitcoin is deflationary, and see how [inflation]( (2500% and some... don't be shy and feel free to add a few digits to that though :P) affected USD for example in the last 20 years, apply the inverse of that to a world wide free market (approx 20-30 times larger than US, and believe it or not, price isn't the most prohibitive in 3rd world countries etc, it's often access. Due to governments and centralization etc.) and you probably have a good approximation. 
Once again, i'm not an economist.
But i as talking with one about a subject related to that just yesterday, and indeed he pointed out ways to create "monetary mass" (my translation from french..), with colored bitcoins. Effectively making some bitcoins worth more than others, it leads me to believe that there will be a redistribution of wealth within a secure decentralized free market could happen... I'd explain how, but i don't know, nor do i have a time machine. Nor a crystal ball.

the are so many bugs on cryptsy
They stole my money due to one of these bugs.
The worst part is, i reported the bug, they replied to my ticket by giving a generic reply for another bug that affects everyone: Negative balances, because apparently if their trade engine is broken, it's your fault.
EDIT: FYI i am not trolling, there are many other exchanges, and i encourage people to create more... cryptsy has been behaving like a centralized authority, which i find horrible for decentralized currencies. The worst part is, at least if a bank website has a bug, you'll get your money back guaranteed. 
The ideal exchange would be decentralized, that has yet to come.

TBH i dont know who has how much... i imagine anyone who got into it before 2010 has a few hundreds at least, or thousands just from toying around and faucets or gambling or what not.
Some others have many thousands if they took em out of silkroad early enough.
And as you said, most have probably single to triple digit at best.
Personally i think the true strength of bitcoin is not in it's investment value (although everyone loves making money, and bitcoin WILL grow.), rather in how it is a decentralized infrastructure to access trust as much as the internet was a decentralized infrastructure to access information. At least that's how i see it, and where i see the potential. Essentially, this infrastructure has the potential of replacing/automating a lot of things that are currently done too slowly, or in a costly manner. All this money could go to bitcoin. 
Now as for the value, if you consider right now all the bitcoins in the world are worth about 2.5 Billion, and compare that to some [large companies]( it's a fraction of what their "estimated" worth (this list is incomplete btw..  WAY incomplete. There's a lot more companies over 2.5 Billion).
to reach 1 Million$ right now, it should have a total worth of about 6 trillion. Barely a dozen times exxon.
And with the rate of inflation as well working against that million, in 20 years it's more accessible. I say it'll be in the 100k-10M by then.
