You will double your coins, because they say so. There is not a public ledger. The value you will be shown is what they say it is, because you really don't know what you own. Only One Coin knows. Like Madoff who printed statements with made up information to his clients.
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:54:46
Excellent post! +1
Banks bank with member Banks of the Fed. Each night banks "settle" up with one another basically through accounting &amp; no physical dollars are sent anymore. 
An exchanges settle accounts within itself through accounting, but when it comes to moving bitcoin out of the exchange...that is done through physically moving bitcoin. And just like the stage coach back in old west days was robbed an exchange can get robbed too, it has &amp; it will.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:39:52
What was interesting to me is what is a Ponzi scheme? Madoff clearly was committing fraud as he was sending out false statements with returns that were not real. Same as OneCoin. I have no idea what Trendon was reporting.

They shill to make money, nothing wrong with that, but the community is welcome to refute. I am calling bullshit on their use of blockchain when they use a centralized database...but that is me.
In my opinion, IBM is slowly going out of business. Who can afford $300+ an hour? They hold no special knowledge and mainframes sales are declining...do they still do mainframes? Watson is just a rules engine...a dime a dozen.

@_date: 2017-01-10 16:29:52
Not to be a dick, but how does this site know?
If the data comes from the exchanges, then is it independently audited or do the post bitcoin addresses of their transactions?
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:38:12
I am not on either side, but you wrote a bunch of strange and confusing sentences.
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:44:48
If I was an exchange and you purchased or sold Bitcoin there might be no impact to the ledger. I could simply make entries in my own accounting system. But I could report this as volume.
The only way a transaction get recorded on the chain is if you move your Bitcoin to your own non exchange wallet.
So how can anyone validate this data other than the exchange? Once again, the exchange can report any volume they want, but only in the 2nd scenario is recoded in the chain.
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:55:16
What is to prevent you from printing up a bunch of notes with the same address on them?

I think IBM is a crock of shit. They are so desperate for any buzz that they will call a centralized Oracle database a Blockchain.

No kidding. Also why cant I remove ETH from the dashboard....what a waste of real estate.

Exactly! There is nothing like this anywhere in the world. 8 billion people on this planet and very few know about Bitcoin. This is still soooooo early. Thank God the code works.

How is this data calculated?
Is this self reported?
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:33:16
So they are making up the number?
Or is this an audited number?
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:37:44
How do you know over 90%?
Source please.
Are the exchanges in China reporting that they own the following addresses....so one can look in the ledger and see all transactions to get to 90%?
What am I not getting?
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:05:09
Which is?
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:36:04
No. Most cloud services run on a collection of wintel machines. Web services. They could be run on Mainframes, but that is old technology.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:59:49
I think they are like Paypal which uses Wells Fargo as their member bank. So you deposit money into Circle and can easily move it between circle members (xls entry). A Circle user to anyone within Circle's member bank (i.e. Wells) is fairly easy...maybe a day. A Circle user to any other Us person is an ACH.
My thoughts
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:35:36
I would be nervous. The legal process loves paper.

The beautiful thing is Bitcoin does both; it serves as a short term asset (very liquid) and as a long term asset kinda like raw land. What asset class can transfer ownership in roughly 10 min?

They had a feature to buy and sell Bitcoin, then took that feature away.
I used and liked the feature, but its no longer available. I am totally within my right to give a negative review. They should have never had the Bitcoin feature. Seems like a rudderless ship.

Money is backed by faith. Did the Germans at the end of WW2 care that the government backed the currency? Do Venezuelan's care today? Even if a currency was backed by gold...who cares...if the government chooses not to pay then they don't pay.
Money is faith. Fiat is faith. Bitcoin is faith.

I finished listening to the show and was laughing at how shocked you guys were. The markets are "crashing." Hyperbole is commonplace in the age of the internet.
Anyways, this election was about anti-corruption. Hillary was corruption. She screwed Bernie.
Junseth spoke about Jesse Ventura in MN. This reminds me EXACTLY of that situation. Reps, Dems and the Media despised Jesse while he was governor. He was no better or worse than any other governor, but he wasn't in their club and he couldn't take the heat.

You guys have a fun show, but you have so many inside references that I am left wondering what the hell are you talking about. To be fair, I only learned about Bitcoin about 1.5 years ago.

No blockchain needed...its too expensive and impractical.
The financial industry will keep their mainframes and windows based databases.

They are not. Bitcoin lives matter.

Maybe I am a cheapskate, but $100 for a Trezor is too much for the amount of Bitcoin I hold.

When you write "this problem" are you referring to dealing with multiple currencies?
If yes, then why not?

One argument I heard Roger make on Mitchell's podcast was that the blocks are full or nearly full with transactions. Is that true? 
Noob here...trying to understand his point. I have made 3 transactions in the last week and none of them seemed to take long.
@_date: 2016-12-15 03:00:29
And Hillary is honest!
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:19:14
We agree to disagree. There is nothing stopping lending against Bitcoin. Nothing! And you can lend as much as you want...just like fiat

The royals don't "own" anything. If you showed me title I would still call it an illegal transaction because at one time the ran it all.
@_date: 2016-12-31 12:26:08
I didn't understand the relevance of the link you referenced in your post 
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:22:09
Are we at a maximum number of transactions per block?
Noob here, I am trying to follow this debate and I saw a graph of transactions per day...i think it was per day. The line goes up over time. It hasn't appeared to level off, so I am curious.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:42:10
I look at like there will always be people that believe its a get rich quick scheme. No different than the stock market. People are emotional creatures. When people don't like Bitcoin I try to ask why.
I just like Bitcoin as a long term technology that I believe will change the world. I know that is hyperbole, but the use cases are endless for the world. Note, I am trying not to appear as I am a tin foil hat type :)
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:41:35
So in theory a miner could exclude a transaction with a juicy fee?
Not sure why they would do that but it is there prerogative.
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:22:33
I think you should use them
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:54:00
Not sure...does it matter?

You don't have to waste your time...don't use a CC. 
The reason it occurs is that there are bad actors and merchants pay...ultimately all consumers pay to remove their bad acts.
Bitcoin is a different animal...I love it, BUT THERE are certain transactions I will never use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:16:25
The Koreans seem to be a little behind the times...who is implementing Blockchain technology? 
Are they going to run Oracle on a distributed network and call it a Blockchain?
I am willing to bet IBM or Deloitte is behind this spin. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 14:09:19
You may be right, but it seems like Circle's only competitive advantage was Bitcoin.
They can't be a Paypall or Visa, so who wants a 3rd party app to route money around...banks already do that....oh well. We shall see.
@_date: 2016-12-11 05:35:34

I am such a noob to Bitcoin, but it blew my mind on the definition of money. Satoshi must have had an economics background

You are correct, but your prediction is the news :)

So what? If I have a nefarious transaction on my CC statement I call Visa and they remove it. Also, they call me. CC are great tools for consumers as long as they don't mind having their data shared.

I am such a noob though so I cant pass judgements

Isnt the big difference is that the USA has its own sovereign money and Italy is part of the EURO?
Seems pretty easy for USA to "borrow" more to recapitalize a bank here or there.

Why do you say its not possible to issue as much debt against Bitcoin?
1. I lend 1 Bitcoin to Fred payable in 1 year at 5%
2. Fred lends that Bitcoin to Sally payable in 1 year at 5.5%
3. Sally lends that Bitcoin to Jane payable in 1 year at 6%
All this happens within minutes of each other. How many Bitcoins exist vs debt?

I don't think all politicians are corrupt, but I do think the office draws a certain type of person to serve. Those types are highly corruptible.
What I love about this election is that people are starting to see the 2 worlds. Bernie had no shot as she rigged the game. Trump beat the Republicans rigged game &amp; they want distance themselves.
Is the only really difference between Bill and Donald is that Bill grew up earlier in a different time?

@_date: 2016-10-15 10:27:03
Per wikipedia (I feel like Michael Scott):
A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒn.zi/; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent.

Wouldn't someone be able to audit OneCoin? The business doesn't really sell anything, but hope. They take in cash "New Sign Ups" and upgrades. They payout salaries &amp; and expenses. The remainder is available for redemption of their coins.
If the cant bring in enough "New Sign Ups" and upgrade money, then they need to manage redemptions.

That fact that any government allows payment via Bitcoin seems crazy in my mind...it is a sign of legitimacy for sure. They never capitulated to the gold crowd and allowed payments in ounces :)
