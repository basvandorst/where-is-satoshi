"They use it as an alternative to gold. It's a store of value, it's a speculative store of value, like gold."  
Respectfully, what exactly is misleading to you?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:38:20
There isn't anything you can do about it, sorry about that but that's just how it is. It will eventually arrive though so don't worry. I advise you pay a higher fee next time for a faster transaction, or move it towards a different currency first with faster transaction speeds.
Bitcoin is very slow right now because it can't handle the amount of users it has, but that will change though. A team of people is working on something called lightning network which will improve transaction costs and speed tremendously. It's being tested on testnet right now and they are close to completion.

Nah it was funny. I just think that the joke went over the head of since he/she seems quite new to the world of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:34:02
I'm not sure but I think he was being sarcastic. The point of the blockchain is that it's decentralized and that there isn't any person that could change anything about the blockchain single handedly.

So what is the most important news from Consensus 2018 thus far?
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:00:35
Thanks, I'm an idiot!

I don't think that people scavenging for rotten meat in garbage bags and going trough the sewers to collect water have the ability to buy solar cells for themselves so they can use Bitcoin.  
You might have solar cells on your roof, you might not, but ask yourself how many people do you know with solar cells that are prepared for a government collapse complete with failing water and electricity services?

Altough I agree with you, that isn't relevant for those who feel regret for not selling at the top.  
Feeling regret is about what you could've done, not about what you've actually done.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:06:15
I agree, but the Venezuelans are worried about starving at the moment not about hedging money.
I realize I might sound a little hostile or stand-offish and I'm sorry for that. I've got close ties to people in Venezuela and the subject tends to make me respond a bit more emotional than usual.

If you really think ETH is shit you don't understand this space. There is enough room for BTC and ETH and they are both innovative and needed for this space to grow. Ethereum is not the enemy here.
@_date: 2019-11-10 09:41:52
What if thats what they wanted you to think in the first place.
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:48:29
Just use a [paper wallet]( for that.
@_date: 2019-11-07 08:13:36
Cuz if you sold at 20k and bought back at 3k you would have had 6 times the amount of bitcoin you started with

The people of Venezuela have been protesting ever since Maduro became president, even before that many people were protesting against Chavez. When you say 'this is what happens when people don't understand inflationary monetary policy' are you talking about Maduro and the people following him or the actual citizens of the country? 
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:45:37
Your wallet and public adres are basically just your bank account, the transaction is done on the blockchain itself.  
If you're spending your bitcoin physically you'd just hand over the paper wallet like you would with cash.  
If you're spending them online you'd be better of with a [web based wallet](

I believe the Vegeta training memes are Vegeta training for his moment to scream "IT'S OVER 9000!!!" at the top of his lungs. He's training for his moment to be used as a meme again. It's quite meta.  
That's why Vegeta is being used and not Goku.

That's what I want to find out.

Fortunately for you....everything that ever existed and will ever exist will eventually get old. That’s how time works.

Isn't bitcoin2x.org the official website? I have no idea how much truth/force is behind their statement.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:48:09
They do work... companies risk a fine of 15% of their yearly income if they don't follow the gdpr, but you're dutch so you should already know that by now.
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:35:26
Alright, seems interesting, I'll give it a read through. Thanks!
Is there a specific article you're talking about?
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:03:56
This guy wants less volatility in the price. He must be a long term hodl-er trying to manipulate the market with his logic.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:47:45
I don't, but I'm interested, could you explain?
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:22:26

Forget about natural selection in 1000 years we will have been genetically modifying ourselves for a long time.
In any case, if a nuclear war happened iodine pills aren't going to do the job for you. If we progressed without hiccups everything is useless since all objects are basically ancient. If we deteriorated to a cavemen society than the gun would be best but only a short term solution because you will run out of bullets. Therefore the hatchet seems like the best choice because you either won't need it and everything is fine or everything went to shit and now you have a long lasting tool to protect yourself and chop wood and other stuff with.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:07:30
Hmm sounds interesting thanks for explaining! I wonder if they have this in my country.
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:14:47
Why would it spur innovations in renewables, it just spurs innovations in finding the cheapest energy source possible. Which doesn't have to be renewables.

Don't worry about what wrote.  Any person that is unwilling to help someone asking for help and telling the person he's doing things in a matter he doesn't agree with at the same time is a complete idiot....He probably doesn't know the answer anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:15:08
I think you're right. I wish we could see the first letter :/ it seems strange to me that that lion would be used for a spin-off and/or that he would wear it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:43:45
IOU an apology then.

the best way to get more bitcoin now is to buy other cryptocurrency that grow quicker in value than bitcoin and then sell those crypto's for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:51:11
Of course! It might not seem like it but the knowledge and intelligence you acquire at school are invaluable. Trust me, being dumb and stupid rich doesn't get you far in life... You'll probably spend most of it before you're 30 on stupid things and by then you feel too old to go back to school. So now your stupid money is gone and you're only left with your stupid brain and stupid thoughts.
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:23:11
You're not wrong. The last time I touched actual cash money must have been at least a decade ago.

Buying a piece of land with a house on it in France is like a dream of mine. Especially with a house or "ruin" that looks like it was build atleast 200 years ago.
Do you have any tips for a foreigner on where to start looking for something like that?
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:13:20
Can you point me into the right direction to set this up for myself? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:09:16
Are you still doing this? You would change my life with 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:10:13
I would be able to pay my education with it.

dude menswear is all about irony these days..and you really can't be more ironic than wearing a purple/yellow tie. It's utter ugliness makes it great.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:23:32
I think it's going to do the opposite, everybody is going to sell of their BCC and buy BTC with it making the price rise.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:55:08
That only works on testnet correct?

Altough my previous comment says otherwise, I do actually agree with what you are saying here. It will probably, more or less, equal out. I haven't thought of it like that yet.
