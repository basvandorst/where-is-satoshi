6% fees, without and hidden lines. Try to get a coin flip on any traditional bookie. Those are the hidden odds you don't see from others which makes Wagerr attractive to people who understand

Check out Wagerr. It's got a lot of sports added now, regularly the best odds in the world, and is just about to add a convenient mobile app!
You will need to convert BTC to WGR, I don't think that will be a major hurdle for you

I don't think people realise the same can be said about fiat, and potentially more relevant

I would suggest you go check out Wagerr. This is a fully fledged sports betting platform and full of similar stories of people have been screwed over by supposed reputable companies. It's fully anonymous and will not limit you if you start winning (another thing all these traditional sports books do). It has a light android wallet, iOS arriving very soon, and has had over $15M in bets run through it so far. 
Whether with Wagerr or another crypto gambling business, good luck!

QC will be here in some form within a few years, not decades. And yes, there will be resistance... Called PoS! Haha

Addressing your two points about value and security there. There's pro's and con's to both

People are taught to be good workers and follow the rules... If you do that, your life will be okay.
There's a lot of media influence and when that changes I expect friends to circle back, probably when prices are 5 timed what they could have bought in for. But for many there's still too much risk.. Be your own bank? Do you really trust yourself in all circumstances? Or the wallet you choose to not have a fatal floor?
I've managed to interest a few friends but only because they've heard about it from multiple trusted sources.
Now for the more contentious part for this audience:
I am still not bought into the whole Bitcoin Maximalist. Understand it's stole a march on everything else and has probably already reached critical mass, but PoW is hideous. No major coin should be so detrimental to our one and only planet. And has no real technical use case: store of value can be any coin. I expect many specialist coins to prevail and the dominance of BTC deminish when it's no longer required as a gateway coin...

Interesting points, I don't see miner cost / effort being directly related to the price of a PoW coin. If BTC increases price 10 fold, would mining difficulty increase by a factor of 10 instantaneously?
Another arguement which BTC may not suffer from now but alts are, you can rent a lot of compute to create a 51% attack. The same doesn't apply for PoS. It's happened recently with several larger alts I believe. It could in future be a problem for BTC. Imagine all China miners shut off...

So perfect that Ethereum has seen the light and is moving towards PoS. I've not seen any refutable argument that demonstrates it's fine for our environment. I have read that a lot of miner energy comes from places with surplus energy, but I also see significant push back in those regions once miners start flooding in. When BTC was conceived, no-one ever thought so many miners would pile in, causing monstrous amounts of consumption. So no, saying it's been refuted is very different from being acceptable.

Agree incredibly difficult on BTC. This is only a major concern to alts. although have you heard of quantum computing? ��
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:54:53
That may be the case for many at present, but I don't think that's their aspiration... BTC is just ahead of the curve from that perspective. In many other ways BTC is behind
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:45:15
I think you're probably correct by compute power, but what a shame that the bitcoin network does nothing with that power except competing to solve a pointless calculation.
Wouldn't it be magical thing it something useful could be tied into all this power usage.
