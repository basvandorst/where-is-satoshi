I disagree with this. Bitcoin deposited by users likely would not be *their* assets. It belongs to the users themselves. If they held all user deposits themselves in combined wallets, then you might be correct but since individual users controlled their own individual wallets, you'd have a hard time arguing that the coins belong to BFX. 
Effectively, it was not BitFinex who got their coins stolen; it was the users themselves.

@_date: 2016-08-04 04:49:54
Yea but even if you can prove they had a fiduciary here (which I think they probably did, despite their TOS), it's plausible that the hack was *not* a result of negligence, at least from a legal standpoint. Even organizations who employ top notch security measures can be hacked. It happens all the time. Even if they had shitty security in place though, that doesn't necessarily mean that they were *legally* negligent, even if you and I think it's sloppy and stupid. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:11:40

Well, they really aren't though. I believe they are domiciled in the BVI. There's going to be serious jurisdictional problems trying to sue or file for anything when it comes to Bitfinex. Different jurisdictions will apply to different aspects of their business (e.g., BVI vs. Hong Kong) and you won't figure out the right move in time, if they don't want you to. 
Not to mention their TOS likely covers their asses pretty well.

Speak for yourself. I make plenty of money with BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:40:05


Well, you really don't know that. It would be up to a judge to decide whether or not they were negligent (assuming you were able to prove that they owe such a duty to begin with). There's no legal standard for bitcoin storage security, and if a judge decides bitcoin isn't even money in the first place, then you won't be able to argue that they had a fiduciary duty anyway. It's also possible that a judge would decide they exercised as much care as they were obligated to do and their security measures were reasonable. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:34:01


Well, for starters, you need evidence of embezzlement first. You also need to consider that was a completely different country with different laws and procedures.

The settlement would undoubtedly include an agreement that they agree to never speak about the case, give any details, or disclose the terms of the settlement. If they do, they'd have to pay the settlement back and possibly more. 
So no, the people who end up settling will not throw them under the bus. That'd be stupid.
Hint: I'd bet you good money several people have already settled with them without much effort just by having enough funds on their exchange to be considered a whale who is given preferential treatment. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:22:12


That would actually play a big part here because if bitcoin is money, then they have a fiduciary duty to their users that may increase their potential liability (though possibly not by much if they weren't negligent), but if it's not, then it might not. Even if they do have a fiduciary duty though, it's still difficult to say that they breached that duty unless they did something completely negligent.

Come on, you're not that stupid. No business in their right mind wouldn't work with counsel to strategize and compile the best defense possible in this situation. Even something ridiculous like "we thought it was the best course of action for our users" *IS* a viable defense strategy. To think they would just put their hands up and not attempt to defend themselves at all is just stupid.
Like I said, you have no clue about any of the things you're trying to talk about in this thread. Just stop. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:27:39


The difficulty here is you need to prove 1) That BitFinex and/or BitGo owed you a fiduciary duty, which may be difficult unless you have a judge that just happens to believe bitcoin *is* money; 2) That BitFinex and/or BitGo breached that fiduciary (or other) duty; 3) That BitFinex and BitGo breached that duty as a result of negligence. 
Those three things, IMHO, are going to be tough to prove. Not to mention the difficulty of suing them in wherever the fuck the proper jurisdiction is. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:57:17
How are they BFX's assets? If this was a different scenario and BitFinex just pulled an exit scam, would you still argue that the bitcoin you deposited on their exchange was theirs? I don't think so. Those assets aren't theirs. They belong to the individual users who deposited them.

I've already read it and "delivery" in the context of futures contracts has no bearing on the current situation we are discussing. The CFTC is a regulatory agency that deals with futures and commodities. That whole CFTC issue is completely irrelevant to the hack issue.
Regardless, the fact that the stolen bitcoins were taken from individual and segregated wallets only strengthens this claim. Did you even read the link about bailments?

Got that right. What a mess.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:33:36
Just being the caretaker or custodian of the coins may not be enough to prove a duty of care or fiduciary duty here, especially with the way their TOS is worded. It's also possible that they had enough security measures in place to not have breached any duty they owed their users. Just getting the bitcoin stolen is not enough to create liability on their part. You have to show a breach of duty and/or provable negligence on their part. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:05:35


There you go making stupid assumptions again. What makes anything about this criminal? This is a matter for civil courts. You have zero evidence that could be used to prove criminal activity *beyond a reasonable doubt*, which is generally the standard that must be met in a criminal court.

The market and leveraged traders keep pressure on both the upside and the downside. I wouldn't be surprised to see $1000 again in the near future, but it would be followed by some large drops as well. Volatility is great in bitcoin markets and very profitable as well, but it will ensure that there is never again the kind of strong run up we saw on our way to $1200 since there is now so many ways to long and short bitcoin and so many people doing both. Large scale run ups are much more unhealthy than the idealist hodlers realize. Be thankful the market is the way it is and learn to trade it profitably.

What? How is that embezzlement?
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:38:49
Can you cite any law anywhere, be it the US, Hong Kong, or wherever, that says they are legally obligated to cover custodial account losses with company capital before spending company capital on any other expense? I think you'd be hard pressed to find such a statute, or hell, even case law to that effect anywhere.
It's certainly possible that they could eventually be court ordered to do so, if they file for bankruptcy protection or are found liable for the losses for any number of reasons, but in my opinion there's a pretty slim chance of the latter happening unless proven grossly negligent and/or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to their customers. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:40:18


Only if they take funds/coins from the custodial accounts. They can spend the company's capital however they want right now until a court says otherwise. Also, as I've said before, they likely have no legal obligation to make customers whole if those customer losses are a result of the hack, unless a court rules otherwise.

That's because US regulations follow the user, not the business. US regs apply to any company accepting US customers, regardless of location. That does not mean a civil suit in the US would fly though, unless you could convince a judge that the jurisdiction is proper for some reason.

For the third time, I know what a summary judgement is and there's absolutely no way one would be entered here. Bitfinex has the right to defend themselves and they have plenty of things they can raise in their defense. Also, [here are the rules of the high court in Hong Kong that lay out what is required for a summary judgement there]( As you can clearly see for yourself, it's not going to happen in this case. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:31:52


Of course, and only in a criminal case, which is honestly quite unlikely in this situation.


Sure, but they have no duty to reveal any of this information to the public. They have not attempted to hide anything, they just refuse to release it, and likely under the advice of counsel. Releasing their books to the public would be stupid, no matter what.


I 100% agree on the bailment aspect. In fact, I pointed this out in several threads (only to have people argue with me about it, of course). I theorized that they are likely guilty of conversion by socializing the losses and I still stand by that. However, it's unlikely that it would be considered *criminal* conversion. It's a civil matter, most likely.


Yes, but there's zero evidence that anything they did would violate any larceny or embezzlement statutes in any jurisdiction, let alone the ones they are operating in. I'm not saying they won't, I'm just saying we don't have the evidence at this time.


That's debatable. It's definitely a violation of securities laws in the US and many other jurisdictions, but it probably wouldn't rise to the level of a serious crime. It'd likely be a regulatory violation that results in a fine and an agreement to cease and desist from violating securities laws. That's in the US though, whether or not it violates securities laws in HK or BVI is debatable and remains to be seen, as does any possible punishment if it does.


I can tell you with 100% certainty that their known assets are not reflective of their total assets, or even their total customer held deposits.


Most likely a combination, for sure, though any contribution made with company assets is unknown and undisclosed and will remain that way until they are forced, by a court of law, to disclose it.


They most definitely are.


I have no doubt there are firms that may take this case on a contingency basis, though I'm not necessarily sure that they are the firms that *should* take the case and lead the way. Given the multi-jurisdictional issues, I can almost guarantee the firms who are moving forward at this point are doing so with the goal of settling, not litigating.
Side note: Since you seem to actually know what you're talking about here, more so than the guy I was debating with, feel free to chime in to [the legal discussion on this matter here]( It's definitely an interesting situation all around, that's for sure.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:37:53
Well, you know when your debit card gets stolen? If the thief has your PIN, the bank will tell you they consider the transaction legit and they won't cover it. It's kinda similar here. The thief used BFX's keys to sign the transactions, so BitGo probably isn't liable. They will probably be sued though, and the legal fees may put them right out of business, but I'd be surprised if they are found liable when/if it all plays out. Again, that's assuming they weren't provably negligent in some way.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:32:29
The problem is there's a big difference between what is best for the company and what the community wants. It's in BitFinex's best interest to shut the fuck up and avoid saying something that can be used against them later. For most companies, the PR team would be working with the legal team to craft the public messages very carefully before saying anything. Of course BFX is not most companies, so they send poor Zane out to face the wolves and respond to everything directly.

No, the losses should not be socialized. Account holders are the owners of the bitcoin in their accounts. They never agreed to participate in a socialized loss system here for this purpose. Taking coin from other account holders to compensate people who got their coins stolen would be theft, plain and simple.

Yea, like I said, it's likely unconscionable and irrelevant, but my point in mentioning it was to show they actually do the opposite of guaranteeing security, by way of actually telling us of the risks upfront, so that could reduce their duty of care a bit, at least outside of the duty implied in any sort of other bailment.


Well my point in mentioning the possibility of them being seen as accepting liability in the case of a 'haircut' scheme is that it would set precedent for anyone who wants to sue them for the full return of funds, and all of the plaintiffs could probably skip the entire liability argument altogether. If you didn't agree that you're liable, why did you accept liability and start paying people back for their losses? Once you accept and acknowledge liability, it makes it much more difficult to go back on it and claim you shouldn't have to pay.


Unfortunately, I doubt we'll ever have full details on that information unless it's uncovered in court documents.


I appreciate the invite, but I spend way too much time on this shit already as is, haha. Thanks though!

Bitfinex didn't steal the coins, but yes, generally speaking, because it was spread out over so many people, the chances of any serious legal action taking place are somewhat low. The chances of any serious legal action being successful are even lower. 
It probably isn't feasible to pursue any kind of lawsuit in this situation unless you lost millions and I'm willing to bet Bitfinex took care of their whales and market makers much better than they took care of the general public users. 
But hey, if you wanna blow a couple hundred thousand dollars on lawyers to pursue a lawsuit you stand at least a 50% chance of losing, go right ahead.

Buddy I haven't traded in BFX in years. The writing was on the wall a long time ago. Their trading engine was shit so I moved on. I'm honestly surprised so many people still traded there despite the constant problems.
Regardless, talking on Reddit does no good. If you want to raise awareness, fine, but you're preaching to the choir here. Everyone on this sub already knows about the whole fiasco. If you want to actually do something about it, then go pursue legal recourse. My whole point here is you won't because it's not worth it. Most other people won't either. The few people who do end up going through the effort (and cost) of suing them will probably settle quietly out of court and you'll never hear about it.
Though if you feel better bitching about it on Reddit, and don't want to actually do anything about it, that's your right. Good luck to ya!
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:47:05


Oh yea, for sure. There will be a lawsuit. Probably several of them. I would expect BitGo to be sued into bankruptcy at this point. BitFinex will be sued as well, but they can probably afford adequate representation and defend themselves pretty well, then wrap it up and file bankruptcy if they lose (or maybe even before then).

So how'd that work out for you? Have you changed the world yet?
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:02:46


Well hacks and attacks happen all the time. That doesn't automatically imply negligence, at least from a legal standpoint. There's also no telling what kind of security measures a judge would see as perfectly reasonable and prudent, but I'd venture a guess that the security measures a judge would rule were reasonable are much less secure than the security measures people in the bitcoin world would want.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:44:22
No, see that's where you're wrong.
Let's use "maybe you can kill..." as a hypothetical example here.
If I walk up to you on the street in the U.S. and shoot and kill you, then yes, I have committed murder.
However, when I'm arraigned on the charge of murder I will still plead not guilty, even if I'm guilty. That's my right. I will then hire a criminal defense attorney to represent me who will build a defense for me. The goal of this defense strategy will be, in simple terms, to create *reasonable doubt*, since criminal prosecutions must prove that I am guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt*. There is plenty of room for reasonable doubt in many situations. Maybe my attorney can convince the jury that you were threatening me, or that I otherwise had a *reasonable* belief that my life was in danger. If he can do that, I get acquitted. 
It's my right to defend myself. It's the prosecutor's job (or the plaintiff's job in a civil trial) to prove their case. Just because you think a case is "open and shut" or that there's no defense to the charges, doesn't mean a jury will agree with you.
This is just one very simplified example, and of course I used a criminal case as the example, whereas the standard in a civil lawsuit is a *preponderance of the evidence*, but the example still fits. Hopefully  you can see why they most certainly have a defense, even if it ends up being nonviable in the end. There's a possible defense to everything.


Of course there were. Many lawyers would love to get paid to pursue this, because 1) there's a good chance they can get high value BFX customers who lost money to pay them a substantial retainer up front to pursue the case; and/or 2) there's a good chance BFX will settle out of court if sued, which will result in a decent paycheck for those lawyers. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:37:50
Just the fact that they were hacked does not automatically create liability on their part. You need to show, via reasons I laid out in another comment in this thread, *why* they should be held liable. That's the tough part.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:07:05


What makes you so sure? I'm speaking in terms of legal liability, of course. I know we all feel they are responsible for it, but in terms of legal liability, what makes you think they are on the hook?


Under what theory of law? You might be able to get a temporary injunction while a judge hears arguments, but then what? What jurisdiction would you even file in and what would the basis be?


That would only open them up to *more* liability if they did that without an order from a bankruptcy court and handled by a trustee appointed by the court. They can't just unilaterally decide to make everyone share in the loss, including those who weren't affected by the hack. I mean they *could*, I just think it'd put them on shakier legal ground than they're already on.

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:12:37
I think you're just having a hard time understanding the legal implications here. Think of it like a bank that someone broke into and stole all of the safe deposit boxes from. The shit in the box belongs to you, but it was the bank that got broken into. Banks are insured though, BFX is not.
The real question here, from a legal standpoint, is what duty Bitfinex owed to you beyond standard security measures. As much as no one wants to hear it, the answer might be *none* so long as they took measures that you agreed to and acknowledged (e.g., they can't be grossly negligent).
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:44:34


That's not how it works. You have to convince a judge that they had such a duty and it's not going to be easy in this situation. Like I said, first you have to get the judge to agree that bitcoin is, in fact, money. Then you need to convince the judge that BitFinex has a fiduciary duty to protect you from loss and secure the bitcoin in a way other than what they did. Then you need to convince the judge that they were negligent somehow, and that resulted in them breaching their fiduciary duty. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:31:59


I highly doubt that. That would create too many legal problems since no one agreed to participate in a socialized loss system for this kind of occurrence. From a legal standpoint, they'd be better off letting everyone unaffected withdraw their coins and cash and telling the people whose accounts were drained that they are fucked and there's nothing they can do. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:17:50

@_date: 2016-08-04 05:14:27


From a practical standpoint, no, of course not. From a legal standpoint, however, yes you do. Of course I have no idea whether that's true in Hong Kong or the Virgin Islands, or wherever the hell the entity that would need to be sued is domiciled. Every country has different laws and regulations and I'm only speaking on what would apply if this case played out in the US. 


That's debatable, really. Prior to the BitGo integration I would have agreed with you. Now though, they may have an argument against it that could hold water.


Where's the embezzlement though? You'd need some evidence that someone there actually embezzled and unless the hack is an inside job committed by one of the principles, you don't have that. Remember too that (at least in the US), criminal allegations must be proven *beyond a reasonable doubt*.

I have no clue what you're trying to say, but expecting them to cover $70million+ in losses somehow is probably a bad bet. I doubt it's even possible.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:55:58


I know they aren't, but that actually works in their favor, at least for now. They can really do whatever they want until someone sues them and a judge orders otherwise. It also means they have a chance to pay some lawyers a pretty penny to construct the best possible argument for when and if it ever goes before a judge. There's no statutory process or regulatory scheme that they must follow at this point, so naturally they (if they are smart) will pick the path that creates the least *new* liability.


I think that's where you and I seem to disagree the most here. All indications are that the funds are separated in one way or another in individual wallets per user. Via BitFinex's platform, each user can essentially control their own coins and do with them as they please (until they were robbed, of course). Whether separate or co-mingled is largely irrelevant anyway though, as I'll explain below...


To you and me, that makes perfect sense. From a legal standpoint though (remember, what's logical to us may not be the same as what a judge decides is reasonable), whether or not a user had their own private keys doesn't matter one bit. At best, BitFinex was a temporary custodian of these coins, but they were still the user's coins. Legally speaking, it's a *bailment* - *"[The temporary placement of control over, or possession of Personal Property by one person, the bailor, into the hands of another, the bailee, for a designated purpose upon which the parties have agreed]( In order to hold BitFinex liable for the losses, you have to show that they breached a duty of care in some way or somehow violated the terms of an agreement, whether explicit or implied. Not only do you have to show it, but you'd have to prove it by a preponderance of the evidence.

The caveat to this, however, is if someone can get creative enough to convince a judge that bitcoin is money and BitFinex owed a fiduciary or other duty to their users and were somehow negligent and breached that duty. That's a tough hill to climb though, IMHO.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:18:22
Well, whether or not they decide to close, and no matter what the exact number of missing coins are, I feel pretty confident saying there's no way they can reimburse the people whose coins were stolen. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:37:08


"Stole" is a harsh word (not that I necessarily disagree though). *[Conversion]( is much more fitting, IMHO. Slight but important differences. If you accept the bailment theory, you have a hard time pushing this into criminal conversion or theft territory, it's a civil matter instead.
I addressed all this in my other reply to you, so I'll leave it at that :)

You need a lot more than just a belief and it's a huge jump to go from civil liability (which is still questionable at best), to a criminal offense.

LOL. If that was true, you'd have no problem finding a statute in the jurisdiction(s) Bitfinex operates in that requires it, but you can't. 
You do realize, I hope, that different jurisdictions have different statutory requirements too, right? 
Also, we weren't talking about addresses and contact info, we were talking about executives. Neither one is required by law in HK or BVI though.

Law enforcement agencies won't care, this is a civil matter. Regulators might, but the wheels of regulation turn very slowly. Suing is cost prohibitive for all but the largest customers, and it's likely BFX has already quietly negotiated mutually agreeable settlements with those customers. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:31:10


You mean *IF* it is frozen, and that's a big *IF*.
At this point, it's highly unlikely and they also probably have enough funds spread out elsewhere to survive such a freeze, as well as the legal team necessary to get the funds unfrozen successfully in a fairly short period of time.
If any injunctions were going to be filed as part of a lawsuit, they'd already be filed. Now it's probably too late for it to help anyone.

Even if we generously assume the hack was 10% of their total funds and they currently still hold ~$630million of customer funds, a large portion of that will be immediately withdrawn once they reopen. Many people will refuse to continue using Bitfinex now as well, for good reason. People who lost coins will begin filing lawsuits, costing BFX increased legal fees at the same time as their revenue from transaction fees begins dropping like a rock. Complete insolvency is likely inevitable.

Successfully as in "too small to attract the attention of regulators"? Because what you're describing is quite clearly a security, and not just according to US law.

It is not an open and shut case at all. It probably *would* be if you could find a way to make a U.S. court the proper forum to bring a lawsuit in, but you probably can't. So, because of that, you're probably facing significant jurisdictional issues with their bank being in Taiwan, and their business entities being in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, respectively. That makes any case anything *but* open and shut.

@_date: 2016-04-17 00:28:36


That is definitely a much more accurate comparison IMHO.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:20:17


No, not at all. Gross negligence is "...a conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care, which is likely to cause foreseeable grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both." To prove gross negligence you'd have to show that they knew the risks of using BitGo and knew a cold wallet system would be better, but disregarded that knowledge in favor of the BitGo system despite the fact that BitGo being hacked was foreseeable. You'd also have to show that BitGo's system didn't rise to the level of "reasonable care". All BitFinex would really have to show to kill that argument is that BitGo assured them that their system was better and funds would be equally safer or safer, and they had reason to believe it.


The fact that no one else does it this way doesn't mean it's grossly negligent. I'm sure everyone at BitFinex thought they were using the best system possible, and I'm sure BitGo thought their system was better than a cold wallet system for whatever reason. Hell, even BitGo's website claims "100% security" - That's a big claim there. My guess is it's BitGo who is going to be sued into insolvency before anyone else, with stupid claims like that. Gross negligence requires the "conscious and voluntary" elements with "foreseeable" loss. That means that you can be wrong, or make a stupid decision, so long as you're using *reasonable* care, and what's reasonable will be up to a judge to decide.


Yep, we definitely need more information and we probably won't get a lot of it until this does see the inside of a courtroom, but the bailment, *reasonable* care, and fiduciary duty arguments will be the key elements here. 
Remember, Bitfinex never guaranteed anyone that their funds would be 100% safe. If anyone made anything close to that kind of claim, it's BitGo. In fact, Bitfinex says clearly in their TOS that they are not liable for losses. Granted, such a disclaimer is often judged to be unconscionable, so it's probably largely irrelevant, but the point is we all know the risk of sending coins to a centralized exchange run by people. Unless the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against them can show a breach of duty, negligence, and/or a violation of an agreement, this is going to be one tough hill to climb to hold them legally liable for the losses. In fact, if they try to employ a socialized "haircut" plan now, they might be seen as accepting liability and fuck themselves even further. Their best bet, as much as it sucks, is to let people withdraw the coins and cash that remain, and tell the people who lost their coins that they are on their own.

What exactly do you think a law firm could do here?
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:14:35

Facebook has done a fairly good job, at least compared to previous competitors, of eliminating fake accounts, but I do think cutting 10-20% off that number is a smart idea. It's still a crazy huge number though.


Gold's market cap is a different animal though. Granted, if people could trade and speculate on bitcoin in as many different ways as they can gold, then it may become similar. 


Bitcoin =/= blockchain technology. I think blockchain tech will eventually be used by nearly everyone on the planet in one way or another, whether they know it or not. I just don't think that has much to do with bitcoin or the value of bitcoin. Bitcoin is just one application taking advantage of blockchain tech. Soon, IMHO, similar blockchain tech will likely replace things like Fedwire and ACH, but I don't see bitcoin itself being used as widely at any point in the near or distant future.


Nope, I put a decent chunk of money into bitcoin in the early days and made shitloads of profit from it over the years. I have also been a bitcoin trader, with trades made almost every week, since 2013. I've made $100,000's taking advantage of the volatility with leveraged trades, longing upswings and shorting big drops, over the last 3 years. I definitely love and appreciate bitcoin as a speculative asset. Hell, I'm in quite a big long position right now and have been for quite some time. That doesn't mean I expect it to become something used by everyday people anytime soon (or ever). I don't expect everyday people to use cattle futures either! :)

@_date: 2016-08-20 05:30:53
English isn't your first language, is it?


Sure, but Bitfinex losing that lawsuit isn't necessarily inevitable. 


That's a big assumption and not necessarily true.


That, also, isn't necessarily true. There's a thing called [bailment]( which may apply here and may keep user deposits from being considered assets of BFX. Their decision to socialize losses may negate that possibility, but we don't know yet since nothing has been decided in a court of law.
@_date: 2016-04-16 23:45:39


That is exactly what I'm claiming. Why would you think otherwise? There probably isn't even 1 million active bitcoin users. Hell, there probably isn't even 1 million people who have used bitcoin ever in the entire history. There's only been barely over 120 million bitcoin transactions total in the entire history of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 00:29:40
What does that have to do with any point of this entire debate? Lots of things can increase in speculative value without a substantial user base. That just means there is people trading it on various exchanges and markets. It has literally nothing to do with how many people use it.

Says who? There's no statute, case law, or regulation to that effect anywhere that I'm aware of.
You might be thinking of the restrictions in place if they had filed for bankruptcy, but that's not the case here (at least not at this point). Even then, the court would likely consider the coins in their custody to be a [bailment]( and not Bitfinex's assets. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:02:58


That's not true. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 00:10:22
You could predict that about anything, but that doesn't make it accurate. Additionally, there's not even much in the way of evidence for a solid argument that bitcoin will become something used by the average person on a daily basis in 100 years, let alone 10.

You have no clue whether or not they have a legal right to do what they did. Besides, even if they did not have the legal right it doesn't mean they don't have a viable defense worth raising.

Private lawyers and individuals cannot "press charges." Only prosecutors can file criminal charges. "Press charges" is something you hear on TV and may occasionally hear from cops who are too lazy to explain what it means to cooperate with prosecution, but it's not a real thing.

Of course. Don't get me wrong either. I'm not saying bitcoin can't hit $1000+ again before then, and I think we'll be seeing it stable around $500-700 within the next 24 months (though it'll rise and fall quite a bit before and after that, due to the typical volatility), but I think anyone thinking bitcoin is going to become as common as Facebook is right now is just dreaming. It simply doesn't make sense for most people to use on a regular basis. It's a tool for tech-savvy investors and day traders, but not very useful beyond those crowds. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 23:44:07
Do you really believe that? Not sure if you're kidding, or just naive. Facebook has 1.23 billion active users. There has only been just over 120 million bitcoin transactions *ever*. There's probably less than a million active bitcoin users (perhaps much less, really) and it's really not growing. If anything, it's probably shrinking in terms of total number of users. Bitcoin sucks for daily use for anything other than a store of value or a speculative asset. It's not something the average person will ever be routinely buying coffee or groceries with, so get that thought out of your head.

The funny part is I was going to add "...that is not a case of actual hard copy piracy" to my request, because I knew that was all you were going to find. 
The big difference between civil and criminal copyright infringement involves *mens rea*. In a criminal case, prosecutors must prove that the defendant acted "willfully" and that one of the following three scenarios applies as well:
1. Intent to obtain "commercial advantage or private financial gain," 17 U.S.C. § 506(a)(1)(A);
2. Copying or distributing copyrighted works with a total retail value exceeding $1,000 within a 180-day period, 17 U.S.C. § 506(a)(1)(B); or
3. Making a copyrighted work available on the internet, despite knowledge that the work was "being prepared for commercial distribution." 17 U.S.C. § 506(a)(1)(C)
Because of this, it makes criminal prosecution of copyright infringement, especially in regards to torrents, virtually impossible, thus my statement that it's a civil tort. Criminal prosecution is extremely rare, and nearly impossible in the context that was originally discussed here (e.g., torrents), unless you're the person who stole a pre-release copy from a studio and seeded it yourself.

Cash is treated a little differently than electronic transfers. Bitcoin is an electronic transfer, but either way, yes you can and yes they do.


Coinbase has no obligation to serve him and they have obviously made the (wise, IMHO) choice to put an end to their relationship with him as a customer to protect their own ass from the feds.
That's all there is to it. 
You can bitch about it all you want, and I may even agree with you, but given the laws being what they are, Coinbase is being smart and proactive. If you don't like it, push your local congressman or senator for changes in the laws themselves. Don't blame Coinbase.

When the US Government starts treating bitcoin like a regulated commodity or currency, it will inevitably run into the same problems that caused people to turn to bitcoin, as opposed to fiat currency, to begin with.

I would agree with that. I think the unstoppable part is true, but I don't think they need to try to stop it though, that's not the issue. Instead they will create enough hoops, burdens, and regulation to slow it down and make it no better than any other commodity or currency. The price of doing business in cryptocurrency in the US will go up tremendously, to the point of being impractical for most, and the process of swapping fiat for crypto, or using crypto for anything other than in person p2p trades, will become a hassle. Bloating a process is what governments do best, if you haven't noticed.

I would love for you to cite the federal laws that require businesses to be clear about how they come up with their list of people to ban from their service. It's going to take a while though, because they don't exist. 
AML laws and KYC laws actually require businesses to err on the side of caution. If there's even a remote chance that the money is being used for illegal purposes, they are required to cancel the transaction and/or terminate the account and report the user. There's no civil rights law that trumps AML/KYC in this regard.

Personally, I think the SEC letters are the most troubling currently.

I *AM* right, Coinbase *CAN* do this. They have no obligation to provide services to any particular customer. They can terminate accounts at will and especially when anything even remotely questionable arises, as in OP's case.


Ever heard the saying, "Don't put all of your eggs in one basket"?


That depends on their policy, which is likely based on whatever advice their attorneys have given them with regards to KYC/AML compliance.


"Innocent until proven guilty" only applies to actions taken by the government, not by a private corporation such as Coinbase who needs to protect their own ass and can pick and choose which customers they want to service freely.


What you deem reasonable is irrelevant. They have no obligation to be reasonable.

The problem with that is it creates a situation where an individual or business can utilize crypto for his purposes, but may unknowingly (or even knowingly) break laws in doing so. 
Take illegal drugs for example. An enterprising organization or individual can make a lot of money with drugs. Drugs are illegal, but the drug trade was *designed to flow around these types of regulation*. That doesn't stop the authorities from arresting and prosecuting millions of people for it though. Also, just like crypto, the authorities allow certain organizations who have enough money to produce and distribute drugs without prosecution, even many of the same drugs that are illegal for individuals to use without a prescription or sell without a license.
The drug trade still flourishes, of course, but all regulation did was keep the smarter, more business oriented people out of it. All that is left is the average users, the black market shady characters, and the elite pharmaceutical characters. The average users, of course, have to suffer with dealing with these shady characters, risking life and limb, just to use the product.
Granted, I'm not saying drugs shouldn't be regulated, I have no horse in that race. Still though, the point remains: Crypto could suffer the same fate.

If you want to play optimist, go invest in the Iraqi Dinar like all the other people who invest on a limited (or wrong) understanding of finance, betting on their optimistic gut feelings instead of reality.

You're delusional if you think they are going to lose any significant chunk of their business because OP can't send bitcoin to a weed dealer. 
Regardless, my point is they don't *HAVE* to be clear with their customers with regards to how they come up with their list of people to ban from their service. It might be a good business strategy (or it might not), but there's no law saying they have to be clear about it at all, so stop using the word "have" as if they are required to.

That's the big question. That's why anyone who realized what this is was amazed that so many people in this sub thought GBTC was hype worthy. It's not. In fact, it's pretty stupid. I suppose if you want to expose your retirement account to bitcoin it's a good thing, but that's about the only purpose it has, and even that is pretty lame.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:09:54


It's probably some sort of automated anti-fraud detection algorithm that determines that. Nothing personal against you.


Yes but *THEY* are, so they are subject to US regulations which can include AML/KYC requirements. They have been getting a lot of regulatory pressure lately, if you haven't noticed.


It's not the bitcoin companies, it's the governments that regulate them.


Quit being a whiny bitch. Either deal with companies that are unregulated and offshore of the U.S. and E.U. (and don't complain if you get ripped off), or verify your identity when they tell you to.

Nope. People pay a premium for professional investment vehicles like that. You're paying a holding company to hold your bitcoin for you, just so you can buy it via your retirement account or brokerage. That's an expensive service, thus the price difference.

Except you're ignoring the fact that leveraged trading was largely missing from the scene during the big increases. Now people are able to take short or long positions at up to 50x (and more leverage coming soon), and that helps to keep the price in check. I don't think increases in the price are out of the question, by any means, but it's likely going to be a much slower increase from here on out (with plenty of dips and drops as well).

GBTC is not BTC. The value of GBTC does not correlate with the value of BTC except for extreme circumstances (e.g., if BTC crashed or suffered from a large scale problem, then GBTC would likely crash as well).
GBTC is an investment vehicle. It's a holding company that holds bitcoin. You are paying a major premium to pay them to hold bitcoin and be able to invest in their company via your brokerage, retirement account, etc.
This has been explained 100's of times now.

Agreed. The asset itself is related to bitcoin, but the price is not. GBTC could move one way, the BTC price could move another. They are not directly correlated and likely never will be. 
There seems to be a big misconception here that whatever GBTC trades it indicates the true value of BTC, therefore the price of BTC should rise to get closer to it. That is far from truth IMHO.


In a situation like that, you're absolutely correct.

It's more than that. I have a few clients that are exchanges (I won't name names) and it's quite the undertaking. First of all, you can literally spend millions just to get all the MSB/MTL and FINcen crap in line. Then once you do that, if not before, you have the insane development costs. If you build a decent exchange from scratch, it can cost you $1mil+ easily. If you license pre-existing technology (which is a better option, IMHO), it's still going to run you anywhere from $5k to $100k+ upfront, plus $5k-$20k/month ongoing, not including hardware costs. Then you have employees to pay, office space, and the basic business expenses. After that, you'd think you're good right? You're $1-2mil in, and you can finally launch and be successful, just by putting some big bucks and effort into marketing and PR right? Nope, wrong. You still have to fill your order book, maintain liquidity, and deal with fraud, scams, hackers, etc. It helps to have a remarketer system to deal with the order book, and an ID verification solution to deal with fraud, so rack up even more costs on that stuff... then you *still* need a minimum of $1mil-$10mil just to float your transactions, and be prepared for all kinds of banking nightmares (frozen accounts, red flags, sudden closures, etc)
Many, many great companies and people set out to build great exchanges a couple years ago, only to find out it's way harder and way more expensive than it seemed when they started. 
It's a nightmare for most. I understand why CoinX never became much, and I can't blame it on a lack of PR and promotion.

I am surprised how many people here don't understand what an exchange is.
LBC is a manual p2p marketplace with an escrow service.
Coinbase, as it used to be, is a wallet with a brokerage service that will sell you BTC.
Sites like BitFinex and the new Coinbase Exchange are actual exchanges with an orderbook and automated order matching (e.g. when you buy or sell, your order is matched with someone who wants the opposite).

It takes quite a big jump to go from Phil saying he buys coins when the price is low, and sells a few coins when the price is high, all the way to "Phil is unethical and fucking people over by front running orders on his exchange!"
If you can't grasp that and just want to run with your torch and pitchfork, that's on you, but it's irresponsible, and that's why I'm challenging it.

If the company is bankrupt, and you are unable to pierce the corporate veil, or even if you can, and the owner(s) have no assets or income, you're not going to get anything. Quite frankly, this kind of suit is not going to be appealing for any lawyer to take on a contingency basis.

This is such an interesting thing for several reasons.
First and foremost, she's a great face and figurehead. A well known figure in the financial world, and she's representing the crypto markets to people who wouldn't otherwise give a fuck about it. She's basically a bitcoin lobbyist in many ways. She doesn't need to know much about the underlying tech. She's a figurehead.
The interview was stupid. They really poked and prodded her for entertainment value. It's kinda funny, sure, but they knew what they were doing and it's pretty cheap, to be honest.
All that being said, her threats of "charges of harassment and slander" are fucking retarded. She has nothing there. Slander in this context is a tort anyway, not a crime. Any attempt to file a police report and push this to a prosecuting attorney in any DA's office in the US would result in laughter at best. She doesn't even have grounds for a civil suit here, let alone criminal charges.

@_date: 2015-08-13 01:11:22
LOL if you think that's all it takes. You'll soon learn, hopefully not the hard way, that where the operation domiciles is irrelevant. It's where your customers are located that matters. Why do you think companies like Bitstamp are filing for Bitlicense and companies like Bitfinex are blocking NY residents? Neither of those companies is located in the US, FWIW.
Millions is definitely not an over-statement at all. It runs $200k+ just to file for licenses in the states that require it, and get the bonds necessary for them. That doesn't include lawyer fees, which you'll definitely need to make sure you do it right, since it's an extremely complicated and convoluted area of law and you don't want to fuck it up. Just ask CoinMX, a company that neglected their legal compliance and ended up with criminal charges because of it. If you think all it takes is locating the company off shore, you're in for a very rude awakening. It doesn't matter if you're located on Mars, if you have US customers, you need to comply with US federal law as well as the laws of the states your customers are in and if you don't, the long arm of the law will find you and fuck you. Big time.

Are you sure there were counter orders to those unexecuted orders? An order can only be executed if there's a counter party. If you have a limit order to sell or buy, someone has to take the other side. If the market moves quickly, and no one does, it doesn't get executed. That's not the engine's fault.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:57:13


That's 100% false.
The Feds have been extremely clear that virtual or crypto currencies ARE subject to regulation.


Of course you could, and you could be prosecuted criminally for doing so. Believe it or not, the laws still apply to you. FinCEN specifically ruled that virtual currency is still currency, and that a person or company is "a money transmitter if the person accepts convertible virtual currency 
from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer 
of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.  The method of funding 
the transactions is not relevant to the definition of money transmitter.  An exchanger will 
be subject to the same obligations under FinCEN regulations regardless of whether
the 
acts 
as a
broker (attempting to match two (mostly) simultaneous and offsetting 
transactions involving the acceptance of one type of currency and the transmission of 
another) or as a 
dealer (transacting 
its own 
reserve 
in either convertible virtual 
currency or 
real 
currency).  " 


My facts are straight, I deal with this every single day. You obviously haven't even run your idea by a competent lawyer (no surprise there). You're the one who's wrong and I strongly suggest that you seek legal advice from someone well versed in the crypto sector and regulatory requirements before you shoot yourself in the foot.
Seriously, that should've been the *first* thing you did, way before begging for money for server expenses from Reddit.

How is it "reckless"? Bitfinex allows very little leverage compared to the chinese exchanges (up to 50x). I'm starting to think you just don't know what you're talking about. Bitcoin idealists hate day traders, I get that, but day traders are the only legitimate use case for bitcoin at the current time, believe it or not.
You're blaming the vehicle when you should be blaming the driver. You'd still be wrong in both cases, but it's a better viewpoint. Also, not sure why you're still isolating BFX when there's now a whole bunch of sites allowing margin trading, some with even shittier engines than BFX, but a lot more leverage.

The problem with all that is that operators are forced to comply with the regulations where their customers are located.

@_date: 2015-08-13 06:59:25
I don't think you realize the fact that regulations in the U.S. apply to the location of the customer, not the business. To simplify, it means a company must comply with laws where the customer resides, so if they don't comply they need to not allow customers of that jurisdiction. The customer gets the shaft, not the business. Compliance, unfortunately, puts ALL customers at risk and puts their privacy in jeopardy, so why, again, do you think this isn't a big deal?

You are amazingly stupid, which is especially evident in your other thread where you believe you can sue Bitfinex for your market losses. 
Good luck with that.

Why is margin trading bad?! Also, you do realize a TON of companies offer it right? Not just Bitfinex.
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:40:21
Dude, give it a rest. You have absolutely no grounds for a lawsuit against bitfinex. What would you even sue for? What tort did they commit against you?
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:46:16
They didn't "rob" anything from anyone.
Even if they did, to sue them for it you would need evidence to *prove* that they robbed you.
Stop trading if you can't handle the losses, for fuck's sake. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:58:44


No they don't. You have no clue what you're even talking about. One 30k sell order (if it even *WAS* one order, which I highly doubt) is not necessarily manipulative. People sell, sometimes in large quantities.
Seriously, trading might not be for you.

Do you not realize who you're responding to?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:14:39
You're relying *WAY* too much on a centralized exchange to control price drops. Markets are, by their very nature, susceptible to movements caused by sell offs (or, conversely, price spikes caused by large buys). Markets crash all the time. I can't believe you're actually claiming that Bitfinex owes you some kind of mechanism to stop the market from crashing too much. You got margin called, bro. That's how it goes. Are you new to trading?

Quite honestly, I'd prefer they change it back to the original name, The Seattle Center Coliseum. 
As far as the MS thing though, I disagree. The naming rights haven't been paid for for years now. KeyBank's contract is long up, but the name remains because it's so expensive to change it back. If MS wanted it, they would have bought the rights years ago.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:59:26
morons aren't in favor of margin trading of anything, at all.

That doesn't change the fact that the Bitlicense puts user information and privacy at risk in a way that Bitfinex doesn't feel comfortable doing.

Typically, in situations like this, the feds will release the "clean" money once they have isolated the dirty money. There will likely be a process in place for filing a claim. Stay tuned in to the court proceedings to find out when you can do this, or contact the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York directly. It's going to be a while before you get your money, but you will likely get it back at some point if you are legit.

How did you send the money? Did you send the exact amount the system told you to when you set up the transfer?
If you initiate a deposit within their site, it gives you a unique amount to deposit or wire that makes your transaction easily identifiable. From the sounds of your post, perhaps you didn't follow the instructions properly?

Even many of the ones that don't will still cooperate anyway.
I guess if you want to live in a country like Iran, who would probably punish you even worse than the US, then more power to you.
Regardless, as I and others have pointed out several times now, your entire suggestion in the OP is virtually impossible. Even the Isle of Man will extradite you. People work within US regulations because that's pretty much the only choice.

That is correct; customers are *not* owed any response. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:43:04
Again, I don't disagree with you. Many Bitcoin startups want to go international on day 1. Well, it's quite common for *any* international business to have big costs associated with launch, operation, etc.
By the way, I found the data I collected last time I researched this issue.
The upfront fees associated with getting licensed nationwide is about $200,000. The annual expenses would be around $140,000. This does not include the legal fees and you'd probably need multiple attorneys, or a high priced national firm to assist you. As you can imagine, it's those legal fees that would run the cost up the highest, probably well beyond the $2mil mark. While many people might suggest doing the licensing process yourself to save money, I certainly wouldn't recommend it.

Banks get robbed all the time. Governments waste money all the time. People still deposit money in banks and pay taxes though.

There's something called *chain of custody* when it comes to evidence gathered for criminal cases. If any of the agents accused of being corrupt are found to have been at *any* point in the chain of custody of evidence gathered against Ulbricht, then the evidence could be tainted on at least some level and this is something that can be brought up on appeal. 
At the very least, it's probably worth appealing at this point. Remember, someone accused of a crime in this country must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This kind of taint definitely creates some level of reasonable doubt. The fact that his defense wasn't able to bring this stuff up in his defense lends credence to the possibility that it was not a fair trial and he was not afforded proper due process. Whether or not he was factually guilty is irrelevant. Like I said, worthy of appeal for sure.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:14:47

No. You're wrong, and it's been pointed out multiple times now, complete with examples, the actual laws that apply, and more. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:09:26
It's because bitcoin is extremely difficult for the average person to get into. It's really pointless for them. Even if they decide to buy some and go through the painfully difficult and often long process of acquiring some coins, they then don't have much they can do with them. Sure, they can go out of their way to find some place that will accept them, but it's much more difficult then just using cash or their Visa/Mastercard. 
As such, the bitcoin userbase consists of two types of people: 
1) The idealists who treat it almost like some religion, where they obsess over all things bitcoin, spouting dreams of some crypto utopia that they foresee in their dreams and promoting anything bitcoin related or anything that accepts bitcoin.
2) The day traders. People like myself who will trade futures and bet on the price going up or down, even manipulating it at times, trying to make a profit every day.
The second group obviously pisses the first group off because it creates some sort of price-regulation in the market. When the price starts rising, people start shorting, betting on it going down. The days of big $100-200 pumps in a short time frame are long long gone, because you'll never get every trader on the same page. [As you can see right here]( as of the time of me writing this post, 45% of the traders on OKCoin are in long positions, whereas 48% are in short positions. Before futures markets for BTC opened up, everyone was, essentially, in a long position. There were no shorts.
That, my friend, is how the bitcoin world works and why things are the way they are now!

No, exchanges use order matching engines. That means when you put in an order, it matches it with someone on the opposite end. If you put in a market order, instead of a limit order, it matches it with whatever orders there are on the book, which can drive the price down. 
Brokerages may buy from you, but exchanges match your order with someone else. Either way though, someone is buying from you. You can't just sell without a buyer.

He was downvoted for the reason you just said, plus he's been posting bad non-legal advice on the sub all morning, about shit he obviously knows nothing about. Also, it seemed that the OP in the other thread was trying to avoid paying taxes on the money in his original post, since he clearly said it was above the tax free gift limits, and OP said "I've used bitcoin for situations exactly like this" - implying that he used it to evade taxes.

I don't think you understand how this whole procedural due process thing works. 
If you have corrupt agents, then you (especially you, the casual observer) really have no idea what evidence (including the diary) is legitimate and what isn't.
Just like in a criminal investigation against a common drug dealer, if the agents investigating him are stealing drugs from him and selling them on the side, the whole case against the dealer can be called into question if not thrown out altogether.
Again, procedural due process.

How do you figure? Any company that falls into the broad money service business category is required to have licenses in each state they have customers in.

That's funny. Regulators never get you "restitution" - If anything they fine or imprison the fraudster which makes it even harder for the victim to get paid.

Do you realize bitcoin most likely has less than 1 million users *total*? Uber provides over 1 million rides *PER DAY*!
Bitcoin has provided a lot of technology and concepts that have potential, sure, and if it can survive regulation and the current "civil war" it may eventually become something bigger than it is now (though that's questionable), but Uber is considerably more valuable at this point in time and the two aren't even remotely comparable. If anything, bitcoin is significantly overvalued, and Uber's value is actually pretty spot on.

I don't know how to explain this to you any clearer. Under U.S. law, courts can and will exercise jurisdiction over a party in another country whose conduct *constitutes sufficient contacts with the state to satisfy due process*. Because this jurisdictional test is ambiguous, courts in every state of the U.S. may be able to exercise jurisdiction over parties anywhere in the world. 
To put this a bit more simply, it means if a company located in a foreign country has a customer in the U.S., the federal and state courts have jurisdiction. 
They can use this to seize domain names, freeze assets (even in foreign countries), seize hosting accounts, compel extradition, and much more. You'd be hard pressed to find a hosting provider, TLD, or even foreign government outside of North Korea who will refuse to comply with the U.S. when the gavel drops. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:33:21


Companies have tried not doing so, like Trucoin, and look how well it worked for them. It's generally a bad idea to block potential customers.


I don't disagree with you at all. I don't think this regulation is necessarily a bad thing. I just always get confused at the sentiment in this subreddit. People are anti-regulation until shit happens, then suddenly they are all for it. There are genuine arguments for and against regulation.


It may very well run that high in fees alone, it's been a while since I've looked into the hard costs. 


Like I said, I don't disagree with you. People have a choice. They can utilize unregulated offshore entities and then stfu when they lose their money, or they can go with regulated entities and maybe have some recourse if shit goes down. What they shouldn't do, however, is bitch about the cost of regulation and/or the privacy they give up by choosing regulation.

There is not a limit. I get that yes, theoretically, there is, but it doesn't work that way and never will. Futures took it down, futures picked it up. Hell the entire pump yesterday was purely a result of futures, look at the 31kbtc margin call. The futures market absolutely controls the spot market. Spot is futures' bitch.
It's not correlation at all, it is pure causation to the fullest extent. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:13:09
Yes, you're right. BTC will be nothing without mass adoption, but for mass adoption it needs to actually solve a real world problem that everyday folks care about, and do so *without* being strangled by the regulation resulting from everyone demanding the government step in to help them when they lose their money. 
What an average joe reads in an article and thinks about afterwards doesn't matter at all. To them, bitcoin is completely irrelevant at this point either way.

I completely get how smart contracts work. The part you're not getting is how people work. Someone will always be willing to sue someone else, no matter what. Some people will always deny agreeing to something even if it's clear as day that they did. Some people will fail to understand what they agreed to. Courts and lawyers will have to hash things out... always.

There will still be disputes though. Language is subject to interpretation no matter how simple it is. That's why we have centuries of case law on the books, telling us how previous courts interpreted various things. 
Even the simplest contract contains language that the signing parties probably think they understand but don't.

They are required by law to comply with AML/KYC and BSA regulations. This means any transactions that are even remotely questionable, or even suspected of being questionable, require them to freeze the account and terminate the relationship.


What, would you prefer they don't comply with regulations and put their own business at risk? I'm not a fan of regulations, but you know, just as everyone else knows, that Coinbase essentially operates as a regulated bank and has to follow similar regulations. Being in the bitcoin business, they have to be even more careful.

@_date: 2015-03-19 17:01:57
It can never be that simple though. The types of contracts we already have, such as your lease, are language. One would think our language is something we all understand, right? So then why are there contractual disputes every day filling up courtrooms?
There will always be disputes, even when they aren't legitimate. A portion of people will always be shady, to an extent, and lie. 
Take a mortgage, for example. A mortgage is prime smart contract material. No need for the bank to handle a mortgage, since it can be tied to the blockchain and when you make your mortgage payment, it can be distributed to the investors financing your mortgage directly. That takes all of the administrative work out of handling the mortgage. Sounds great, right?
Now, let's say you stop making payments on your mortgage. Then what? Someone is going to have to handle the foreclosure process. Then, naturally, you're going to dispute it, and claim some clerical error invalidated the agreement or something. Or you're going to want to refinance or restructure the mortgage. Perhaps you'll even take a long shot and claim there is no mortgage and dispute the contract's validity to begin with. There's still a LOT of room for dispute there, see what I mean? Even if you don't dispute it, someone has to handle the foreclosure process itself. The investors aren't just going to come to your house and throw you on the street. They will have to take over legal ownership of the home, then follow proper legal procedure to evict you.
Like I said, still plenty of court and lawyer involvement, and plenty of room for disputes.

@_date: 2015-11-02 20:18:39
Yes, and my point is that they likely don't see enough demand for accepting bitcoin. Many companies who took the plunge simply don't see much in the way of use, and those case studies are keeping a lot of other companies from being willing to accept it. If companies see a benefit and demand, they will accept it. If they don't, they won't. It's as simple as that. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:20:04
Why would they accept bitcoin? The limited demand doesn't really justify it. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:56:11
Why would they buy it when they can just file a UDRP complaint and take it from you?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:44:53
Yea, that's a result of regulation. Federal regulations, plus burdensome tax and accounting requirements, make this a much more difficult space to navigate for pretty much everyone, including end users, merchants, traders, etc.

@_date: 2015-03-19 16:43:04
Sure, but when there's a disagreement, and you have to go to court to settle the dispute, are you just going to go in by yourself without knowing anything about court procedures? Kinda hard to learn everything there is to know about how court procedure works, when you can submit evidence or testimony, how to go about it, etc. without a lawyer or a law degree. 
Most people who try to do that end up not even being able to argue their side because they didn't follow the rules, didn't submit evidence properly, etc.

For the third time, it doesn't matter what a dictionary said. Police don't enforce contracts, don't handle torts, don't settle civil disputes, etc. There's no way around that. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just being dense.
Regardless, take contracts as they exist now as an example: If you and I sign an iron clad contract, it's very clear what we agreed to and who signed it. However, people still have disputes. They still sue. They still go to court. Hell, most people these days can't even understand a common lease. Most people who sign leases don't understand joint and several liability. They don't understand some of the most basic language in a contract. That will never change. Even with smart contracts, people will still make ridiculous claims later on that they didn't mean what the contract said they meant, that they were misled, that it wasn't them who signed it, that they got screwed over, etc. There will always be disputes and we will always need courts to settle those disputes, and lawyers to represent our interests, negotiate, and explain things to the parties involved in these disputes.

A friend and I found a private key in there associated with bitcoin address 1FMB6cHNSEnat87etkfnp9V5etfX7KQX5S, but the wallet had 0 BTC in it and has never been used. 
EDIT: Found another, associated with 1LKHKNbJuM2VYHxMC61qYmhFvNbURWQkab. Also empty.

Every week, on Thursday night at 11pm pacific time, the weekly futures contract settles out on OKCoin.com, the biggest BTC futures market out there. That always makes the market jump in one direction in another a few hours before settlement, and sometimes up until or right after settlement, depending on how it goes. Then it jumps again over the weekend as people reset their positions.

Your other option is to wire your money to an offshore exchange, but that won't be instant either. 
You can deal with US companies, but then you have to deal with the US regulations and shit like this. 
The final alternative is to buy bitcoin directly from someone who has them. Try LocalBitcoins.

Pay the lawyers for what? Is this a private civil action? I thought the point was pushing for prosecution?
This comes across as a half-baked campaign with little to no understanding of the legal system.

Holy shit, this is ridiculous. This is why people laugh at this community. It takes a decent idea and just throws it as far into left field as possible, wrapped up with all kinds of utopian idealist nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:57:19
I guess. Not sure it really matters though. Lots of people pump together, short together, and make moves together to get the market to do what they want it to. It's a relatively low volume market, so it's not all that difficult.

You are going to lose this. For one, it's against PayPal's TOS. You'll be lucky if they don't shut your account down for this.
You can complain to a toothless organization like the BBB but it's not going to do shit. The "authorities" won't care either because, for one, this is against PayPal's TOS, like I said. Your recourse is to sue the person you sold the coins to in small claims court. Of course if you're not local to them, this is going to be more trouble than it's worth. 
Consider this a lesson. Don't use PayPal to sell bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:43:58
Step 1 - Make a post on Reddit that claims bitcoin should be worth $88,888.

IRS guidance means nothing in this context. IRS doesn't regulate financial businesses, FinCEN does. To put it simply, a business is a MSB if the feds say they are. In this case, exchanges facilitate the transmission and exchange of currency, therefore they are MSB's.

Where the hell did you see an offer for $1,284.98 on LBC? Even if you're right, it was probably for something stupid like a trade for Transit Cards or something. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:24:07
Yes but the problem is the time required to complete transactions. The price can go up or down substantially in the amount of time it takes to get a few transaction confirmations, so that's not conductive to the process of exchanging or trading. That's why it makes more sense to put fiat *IN* the exchange's wallet, then trade/exchange. That way you can complete your trade in less than a second, as is required to secure the price you want. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:30:27
Um, ok. When you decided to use a highly regulated US based broker and exchange, what did you expect?
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:44:33
You must have missed the memo. I'll sum it up for you:
Rule  Everyone has the freedom to do and say as they please, so long as the "community" agrees with them. If the community doesn't agree, then censorship is ok.
Rule  Regulation is bad, until someone gets ripped off, then the "community" begs the government to step in and control everything, and wonders why the government didn't help to begin with.
Kinda funny, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:51:42
So what? What is your point?
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:54:13
You're probably not going to find one. Do you have the proper FinCEN registrations, MSB licenses, etc? If so, you have a slightly better chance, but most processors are going to avoid this due to the extremely high risk of fraud. Companies like TruCoin that accept credit cards for bitcoin have to implement large scale fraud detection and identity verification systems just to keep the chargeback ratio manageable, and even then, it's a HUGE undertaking.

@_date: 2017-06-22 03:43:31
Generally speaking, it's going to come down to whether or not you are buying and selling bitcoin for profit, and would be considered a business venture. 
If you simply invest in bitcoin at one point, then sell it at another, you *may* not qualify as an MSB. However, if it's an ongoing business venture, then you might be. It also often comes down to the MSB laws where the buyer is located, not just where you are located.
As much as you don't want to hear it, you really do need to talk to a lawyer.

@_date: 2013-10-02 16:49:43
No. He put the "bounty" on him with the people he owed money to. It's not like he tried to hire some random person to do it. "FriendlyChemist" owed money to someone and tried to blackmail DPR into paying it for him. Instead, DPR established contact with the people FC owed the money to and that's when the bounty was suggested.
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:48:48
Except we're about 4 hours from Futures settlement on OKCoin, which usually triggers some movement. Not to mention the weekend moves we've been seeing lately. 
All in all, you probably spoke a little too soon.

Hate to be the party pooper here, but Fabian is NOT the owner of Manwin. He is the *FORMER* managing partner. The company was built from the assets of Mansef, after Mansef got a ton of money confiscated by the feds.
There's a lot of speculation and mystery surrounding his own personal networth, but he is not and never was the owner of the company (he had several partners and was likely just a front-facing strawman for the real people behind the scenes), and the company was funded using loans (including one from a Wall Street Hedge Fund in the $300+ million range). Some people believe he also obtained large investments from [these two guys]( and/or is washing money for them (perhaps they are the real owners?).
It's also worth noting that most, if not all, of their acquisitions were bought on terms and if those terms are broken, the properties revert back to the original owners.

Because court procedure is very clear and he has a right to trial by jury, at which all evidence can be brought into question and argued against if necessary. 
That is, unless he takes a plea deal.

It's in [the criminal complaint.](
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:06:34
Could be, but now it's going to be used against him in court so if that's the case I hope he has some solid evidence to back up his story.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:01:26
What an idiot. That was really stupid.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:09:03
That's a nice conspiracy theory you have there, but if that was the case then it should be pretty easy for a good team of defense attorneys to see him cleared of all charges.  
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:39:17
Both sides persuade the jury. It works both ways. However, only the prosecution has to prove their side BEYOND a reasonable doubt. The defense only has to create reasonable doubt.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:26:00
I'm not going to write up the details of how court works, but if the FBI is going to "just add in" messages, they still have to prove they came from the accused party.
Additionally, it's the defense's job to cause the jury to question whether or not the information provided by the prosecution is accurate or even true. It's called "reasonable doubt." If you can maintain reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury, they must acquit. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:04:18
Are you implying it's all a lie the feds are using to indict DPR? Or are you implying that the entire thing is a hoax?
Evidentiary procedure would pretty much solidify this as true. If it's not, it'll come out in court. It's not like DPR won't be able to obtain a solid defense.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:53:39
They claimed it was "taken care of." Authorities, however, say there was no murder. In other words, it looks like it's possible that the supposed supplier FriendlyChemist owed money to was actually FriendlyChemist himself and he successfully scammed DPR.

And here, everyone, is the natural chain of events becoming ever so clear.
First, people rave about the unregulated currency.
Second, people invest their money in to the unregulated currency.
Third, people see awesome gains from the unregulated currency.
Fourth, people lose all their money in the unregulated currency.
Fifth, people demand regulation and bitch about the unregulated currency.
See guys, this is why we can't have nice things.
