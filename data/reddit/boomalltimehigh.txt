I'm aware of the block stats, that doesn't prove motive.  It could easily be something simple like human error.  Fact is they started mining full blocks later on and have continued to do it.  Do you have a more recent tweet that correlates to empty blocks and indicates intent?

It's not silly, it is a pretty big deal.  One troy ounce is how the price of gold is expressed by most humans.  Ask anyone on the street who knows about gold what the price is and they will tell you the conversion rate for 1 troy ounce of gold in fiat currency.  That's the way it has been for quite some time.  So it is a measure by people for tracking value and when you look at 1 troy ounce of gold on the charts it is pretty boring, gold charts are boring.  Bitcoin has come along and while having some of the properties of gold, it is wildly different.  It is gold on steroids and the way we commonly express the price of it has surpassed the way we commonly express the price of gold.  That's a pretty big deal.

You just have to look at the side bar to know that.  It's not like they are hiding the fact that this sub is about bitcoin and whatever implementation is the majority.

Bitcoin exists entirely because tracking real world assets using any method(today) requires trust and will be prone to fraud.  Whether it is gold, fiat currency or cars, you have to trust a system to report correctly and honestly.  You don't seem to understand why bitcoin even exists let alone how this new business opportunity may be prone to fraud.  But sure, rah rah this new shitcoin is the best!
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:24:49

That's not really true though.  Search this sub for ethereum or monero or anything else and you will find both.  Obviously people will tend towards bashing altcoins around here since this is a bitcoin centric sub so you may see more of that but I don't believe there is some sort of malice on the part of the mods.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:12:29
Too bad.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:41:16
That makes no sense.  If you plan a fork, you want to own as many coins pre-fork as you can.

Is that still true?  I think they changed the rules or we would be seeing a lot of newbies who got scammed coming here to complain like we used to.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:22:59
non-equivalent in what way?  They are equivalent in that they are the standard by which we measure the price and sentiment.  Ask most people what the price of gold is and they will tell you the conversion rate for one troy ounce of gold to your fiat currency.  Ask most people what the price of bitcoin is and they will tell you the conversion rate for one bitcoin to your fiat currency. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:24:45
Hey Bankers, if you are reading this, I am totally alright with you turning Bitcoin into a multi-trillion dollar market.

That's nice.  That's not guaranteed.  You may disagree but I believe the price would recover and holding a large stake in both chains would be preferential from a long term investment perspective such as my own.

As best I understand it, they can announce at anytime leading up to the deadline that the ETF is denied.  If they say nothing it is automatically approved.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:45:40
Precious metals markets are a bad bet because you have to trust everyone in the market to be telling the truth in order for it to work.  So it doesn't.  We don't have this dependency with Bitcoin because verifying is built-in to the protocol, you can do it at your desk.  Try verifying that HODLX INC really holds 537 kilos of gold or silver. :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:51:23
Moderators have loosened up a bit.  People like Brucey will push it again until it gets out of hand and the mods tighten it up again.  Then people like Brucey will cry censorship and go back to their hole(rbtc).  I've seen this cycle before. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:20:24
HODL was HOLD misspelled and everyone latched onto it.  You can call yourself a hodler if you hold through big dips where everyone is panicking.  I've been hodling since January 2013.  Bought bitcoin every month all the way up and then down and then up and then down and then up, well you get the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:37:46
Yea but I don't think they automatically side with the person who initiated the charge back like they used to.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:26:46


  
Sounds like they use a network of pools and that implies it is whatever those pools are running.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:10:18


  
I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion but I'm sure you see now that it was the wrong conclusion.  Bitcoin has always been a high risk high reward.  That might change in the future but it hasn't yet.

Fairness is like religion.  You can convince good people to do bad things in the name of it.  Be careful how you embrace it.
  
Segwit is implemented in core and core is the implementation that the majority embraces to enforce the rules of bitcoin.  Should that change, this subs moderation would change accordingly.  So I disagree that it is unfair, it is fair within the rules they have presented and I don't see anything bad.

People pushing FUD right now, probably trying to short the market.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:15:19


  
That view is Bitcoin and Bitcoin is currently driven by the core implementation.  They do allow discussion but are measured in their approach so that this sub is not ruled by special interests that can create a lot of noise.  A good example of this is altcoins and their pump and dump cycles.  You will notice that discussion about an altcoin becomes curtailed around here when an alt is on the move up and the pump atmosphere is at its strongest.  But later when it has died down, discussion flows more freely.  The proof is there if you want to look at it.  I think some prefer the drama.

People around here don't place a lot of faith in "The Gold Market" because it is opaque and likely fake.  It is a dinosaur in our technological world in terms of measuring and determining true market value.  I can't think of anything better equipped to find its true market value than bitcoin.  The market does not sleep.  I can tell you how many have been minted and give you real time metrics that you can trust.  Gold cannot compete.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:56:41
You should learn how the ETF is structured.  They have to hold .1 BTC for each share they issue.  So each share is backed up by .1 BTC and we can easily verify with 100% certainty that they control the correct amount to back it.  This is very different than a metals ETF where you have to trust that things are being reported correctly and that the metal hasn't moved and been "sold" again.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:39:05
It is the most recognizable denomination of gold right now.  Just like 1BTC is the most recognizable denomination of Bitcoin.  Both of those things could change in the future but right now we see this as a milestone as one recognizable and trust-able denomination passes the other.  Sadly we are measuring it using our untrustworthy whore of a fiat currency.

There is another insider angle.  If you knew it was going to be automatically approved with no comments then you know what the market is likely to do for a few days and you would know you had time for another pump and dump before there was too much pressure on the market.
