That's actually how I identified the problem in the first place - I got an SMS that they were attempting to authenticate as me, but they only forwarded phone calls, not texts.
I treated Coinbase as a bank account and didn't have a guessable password on it. However, I also have a persistent account balance of zero. There's just no point in trusting anyone else but myself with a wallet with significant funds.

With encrypted wallets, there's no point to trusting them, which is what saved me quite a bit of BTC... Now THAT password is definitely not guessable before the heat death of the universe...

Hopefully your email is encrypted.

Well they'd have to link it to a bank account or something first, right? My account was either unlinked, or I purposefully broke the link after I did my business with them.
It's possible they never breached coinbase, but I think they did. My coinbase password appeared to be changed (I reset it) and my phone was no longer verified when I got back in.

You're right. I think the strong password thing goes without saying. The point of the post wasn't security 101, it was to make people aware that something trivial like a Reddit account can still go a long way toward compromising you. My email didn't used to be interesting.
The net result of their attempt was about 45 minutes worth of cleanup on my end and one less sucker in the world (hopefully even fewer after this post). I'd love to get my old Reddit account back though.
