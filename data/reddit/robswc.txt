It’s ridiculous.  I would love my money to be secure but if that means higher fees and no leverage, no thanks.
Ironically, bitmex is the “safest” exchange.  If you want to trade $10k positions you only need around $1k to do it comfortably, that means you don’t need to keep the other $9k in a “not your keys not your coins” wallet.  
I firmly believe if you go in and lose everything that is 100% on you.  There’s warnings everywhere about it.

What a display of fundamental ignorance, lol
So any job that “doesn’t add value” isn’t a real job?

essentially.  I mean at the end of the day you're putting x amount of money in something that isn't 100% guaranteed not to implode and keep your money stuck in limbo.  I'll take $100 on a shadier exchange vs $10,000 on a "more legit one" 
especially if you're throwing in lower fees lol

I could lift a box up and down all day, it wouldn't be contributing anything.  I could work at a scam call center, that's moving things around.


So what if he's buying mined crypto?  I know tons of people that just mine and want to sell with low fees.  Everyone is screwing everyone else over, in that though price moves which creates winners.

how do you know?  I don't think any exchanges have a big neon "this crypto was mined" next to the orders lol


Many jobs involve just clicking something on a computer...


Leveraged trading allows you to trade with more than you have in your wallet, this is great for reducing risk by having too much crypto on the actual exchange.

Yea, I don't think he's traded in awhile.  Even says most his profit is pretty much from everything else.  I would respect it more if the dude was "retired" or reached "legend" status but now just looks like a course peddler.
