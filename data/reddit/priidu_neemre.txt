You probably lost them a long time ago then. IIRC Cryptsy had a really controversial clause in their ToS which basically said that they are allowed to seize all your funds if you haven't logged in for X days. Don't quote me on this though.

To anyone interested: Gavin probably made a typo here &amp; meant Ted Nelson's infamous vaporware project "Xanadu" instead.

@_date: 2016-01-14 16:55:52
I was merely referring to the fact that it's rather unlikely that either Gavin or Mike have some sort of ulterior motive (*e.g.* double-agent government shills sent to destroy Bitcoin) for publishing what they do. Human emotion &amp; imperfections are a much more likely explanation ([Hanlon's razor]( and all that jazz).
Your comment, however, appeared borderline paranoiac to me -- thus my reply in the form of a snarky comment (sorry).

To add to this, what the hell is a 'Bitcoin collision' supposed to mean in the first place?
EDIT: To clarify - we have key collisions (ECDSA) and address collisions (RIPEMD-160), or alternatively block id/txid collisions (SHA-256), but not 'Bitcoin collisions'. Thus, the naming is as bogus as the math behind it.
(Note: the above comment talks about address collisions (RIPEMD-160) specifically)

Agreed, the idea for the name is really good in itself (IMHO), but Mattityahu doesn't really have that ring to it (the way that Eligius did, for example) and is slightly clumsy. Thinking of a cool and fitting name can be so damn difficult, though. :P
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:55:10
No luck for you I'm afraid -- at least that would be the standard practice for most businesses in the space (*e.g.* Coinbase, Satoshi Dice etc). Your actions are your own and it's unlikely anyone will reverse them in your favour.

@_date: 2016-01-14 16:49:06
Yes, technically that would still be BTC. The only problem with your counter-example is that the probability of several large mining operations coming together to endorse such a policy is utterly small. In other words, it would not make sense economically, because it would defeat the whole system's purpose and destroy the currencies face value, essentially rendering the miner's investments worthless. (Something you'd probably know if you'd at least taken the time to read Satoshi's original whitepaper)
The only condition that could make this scenario possible is when an extremely powerful faction (such as GHash back in 2013/2014 with about ~45% of the hashing power) or another external entity set out to specifically destroy Bitcoin (regardless of their financial loss). In which case -- they could probably do it much more effectively via other means (*i.e.* variations of the 51% attack, en masse double-spending, mining empty blocks or spam-filled blocks only etc).

Luke, although I don't agree with you on a lot of things (Bitcoin and otherwise), I am really really sorry for how people are treating you on this thread. Just so you know -- not everyone on r/Bitcoin is like this.
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:14:02
You basically just described consensus as defined by Satoshi in his original whitepaper:


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them.  **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**
What's your point?
It's like with traditional market economy -- developers and companies can proclaim whatever they want; ultimately the customers (users, miners) will make the choice &amp; vote with their feet. Other, less savy users will obviously (as you pointed out) follow the more prominent members of the community -- that's human nature for you.

@_date: 2016-02-02 15:24:36
That's a one-way inference you're applying the wrong way, *i.e.* you're correct that micro-transactions are heavily correlated to to super low fees, but super low fees are not necessarily correlated to micro-transactions.
Essentially, that's like saying: cars and boats share some common materials (txns of various sizes share low fees) =&gt; hence both were designed to be driven on water (all txns must be micro-transactions). 
Not sure if you're really not seeing this mistake or just too stubborn to acknowledge it.
@_date: 2016-02-04 08:25:24
Yeah, I agree that the previous poster's rant in unfair. I'd say most wallets DON'T have HD support still.
@_date: 2016-02-02 07:26:12
Super low fees have been one of the main selling points for Bitcoin up until now. By your logic it would be easier to go back to using credit cards instead (like $.40/txn here) with no additional conversion fees + less tedious "materialization" process. 
Just because you use Bitcoin for ideological/altruistic purposes, doesn't mean other people will. With "as-high-as-credit-card" txn fees, there really isn't much point to using Bitcoin unless you're worried about capital controls/live under an opressive government -- or alternatively, want to do something illegal.
Also, as you will probably know, Bitcoin txns aren't instant (and "any sum of money anywhere" isn't really accurate either, since bigger sums tend to include a much higher number of outputs, sometimes leading to exorbitant txn fees). This is the same kind of hyperbole and misinformation as "Bitcoin = free transactions", which you are ironically arguing against here.

Super low fees == micro-transactions to you?
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:00:27
You've probably heard this one too many times already, but ISP-enforced bandwidth limits (especially "overly low" ones) aren't really a thing in many parts of the world :P (including most places in Europe AFAIK). That being said, 2.1 TB in one day (I presume?) does sound like an awful lot, lol.
BTW, the 0.12 feature that you mentioned sounds really great &amp; useful. Didn't know about that.
EDIT: It seems OP might've meant 2x170GB rather than 2,17TB, which sounds a bit more sane (but still a lot).

@_date: 2016-02-02 11:36:17
Who mentioned anything about micro-transactions?
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:29:57
TL;DR: everything you said in your previous reply is correct, however that doesn't mean the relationship applies the other way.
Anyway, better call it quits :) we're getting far from Bitcoin and deep into logic &amp; semantics now :)

Wow, that sucks. The only packages that have a hard limit/throttling here (northern europe) that I'm aware of are the (wireless) mobile access ones (*i.e.* EDGE/3G(UMTS)/HSDPA/4G etc), which have pretty low limits indeed (like 25GB/50GB/100GB etc depending on how much you are willing to dish out).

Read [this]( thread for more information. He also states that he used a throwaway on purpose to avoid revealing his identity -- because you know, he probably holds quite a few more coins (conclusion: nothing particularly sinister or interesting going on here).

Why the downvotes? Isn't this a valid opinion? I genuinely believe nothing will ever happen to the coins -- even moreso IF Bitcoin 'takes off' more than it already has. 
And please don't take me for a 'crazy old Bitcoin guy' &amp; crosspost this to [r/buttcoin]( Just consider the following -- any economically sensible entity would've sold all (or at least a fraction of!) their coins once the value soared by a couple orders of magnitude (and long before the $1k bubble -- maybe foolishly so, but hey, that's just human nature).
But then we get this guy called Satoshi who practically acts like a saint throughout most of his communication. If you go back and read his posts, it really is very hard to detect any other motivation in his speech than the love for this technology &amp; his long-conceived brainchild. And to top it off -- once things start working out for him and the community, he decides to announce his departure from the project (which is really the only way Bitcoin could've lived up to its promise of not having 'a leader' &amp; a 'single point of failure', if you think about it). So yes, I truly believe that the keys might very well be destroyed, meaning these funds will never move.
