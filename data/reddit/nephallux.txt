Neither does mine if you are on their chosen machines, but I was out of town and there was none around. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:43
What a bunch of retards, it's literally frozen nothing is happening
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:23
Go to gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:19
In cryptoland, 2 weeks is like 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:21
Totally got me wanting to pull everything I have out of Coinbase. What's the best way to use Shapeshift for that? Haven't used it before
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:26
14000 now
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:47
Now that’s pretty cool
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:43:34
Not in the town I’m in. Would be willing to move for the right opportunity 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:58
We’ve all been there. Take it as a learning experience 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:41


@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:39
Thank you! Worked like a charm
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:23
I sold all last night getting panicked and I’m regretting that this morning. Bought back in at 15k
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:40
If you think that you miss the point of cryptocurrency entirely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:16
I think he said he sold them all... why not move it out? I'm trying to figure out the best way to do so... suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:05
oh man they are going to be having buyers regret in the morning
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:11
Don't mind if I do, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:47
I got chocolates everyone
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:50:27
Couldn't agree with you more. I'm a developer and would love to be part of the growing cryptospace. However I'm also a husband and father and need my mediocre stable job to supply me with the funds to keep us going.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:55:25
ATM outside the banks network, we were at a holiday gathering where only cash was accepted. I normally only use my cards nowadays
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:02:46
That's a lot of dongs for a buck man
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:24
Ahh yes trust a 14 yo on the internet! But seriously I'm with you on that man
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:19
everything crashed
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:48
Dude I'm not going to lie, it's super entertaining tho
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:40:34
That’s not backing. That’s a cartel. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:03
You’ll say that again when it hits 40
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:39:31
Backing behind money these days is literally nothing. Please educate yourself on what happened in the last 90 or so odd years
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:31
Same!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:02:46
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:48
Sell to your USD wallet and then buy back using said Wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:49:08
If I reached step 10 does that mean I'm ready?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:17:42
If you can catch it
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:53:22
 Totally on board with this
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:24
How quick is the transfers? I didn’t know about shapeshift thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:59
Yup I just noticed it and saw it go down to 16k in a few minutes 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:52:54
Yup as I thought nowhere near me 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:43
Yeah I really want to get my coins out of CB now but man... probably will wait for this to die down a bit. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:04:56
I’d like to get away from banks all together and go entirely crypto. Let’s hope it happens soon ;)
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:38:59
That was just 3 days ago.. in crypto you gotta just ride the waves man. We you telling them to be expecting huge returns in short time?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:46
Well they money was already in the machine so.. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:12:10
Lol no and haven’t even wanted to. I’ve seen them go up around Europe and figured it was a way to get people without internet access to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:35
I feel that many of the people shitting on crypto recently have not even tried to gain an understanding of how the technology works and adamantly refuse to even try. 
Education is the key people. The more these people who spread false rumors and information the more it sinks into the mainstream creating a black cloud over it all. Just look at this last week. The only way to counter this is to make the technology terms palatable while also not framing it in traditional ideologies like “mining”, “gold”, “stocks” etc.
Simply put there hasn’t been a good analogy of crypto currency because nothing has existed like this before. It’s a new frontier and we’ve definitely not seen even the tip of what it can eventually become.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:59
Stop the Fomo and Fud. You’ll be fine! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:36:25
Bitcoin vs Litecoin exchange value has nothing to do with what I wrote about. 
But to answer your question it comes down to total supply vs current market cap. 
Someone else maybe able to give you an ELI5
Edit: your comment itself answers your first question 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:48
It almost hit 20k on Coinbase last hour
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:04
Lots of traffic after the BCH fork went live
Edit: Live might be extremely overstated lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:30
wow just wow
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:35
That was my plan the whole time, until I realized I missed the fork by a week. Whatever still the same lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:49
Just get in a little at a time 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:50:34
Not justifying the large fees for bitcoin just something to keep in mind as well
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:25
And my paychecks don’t come this quickly!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:36
why did you take a video in portait, just flip it on the side man
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:13
Not falling for a scamcoin tbh. I have done my research thank you
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:14
Isn’t that always the plan 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:53
was able to login just now again, but yeah they are removing BCH until January 2018 lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:42
Thank you! Just didn't need all the caps to understand
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:31
It’s the load from exposure in NYT
Don’t blame Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:17
Honestly I have the same question, anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:52
BCH is centralized and being pumped and dumped by the people wanting to destroy cryptocurrency. You make the conclusion however you want
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:00
Yay free coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:05
GDAX / Coinbase done fucked themselves
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:12
Also GDAX has been frozen on BCH  for over 30 minutes now. Fucking disaster
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:33
Bitcoin Cash price
8:59PM CST
Bitcoin price
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:01
Shit man wish I had that kind of disposable savings laying around 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:29:11
Buy in the dip, at the peaks and slopes and whatever curves awaits
