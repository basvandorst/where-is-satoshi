ok, thanks for the info!

Thanks! Yeah, it just doesn’t the feel right! So may I ask what the safest way in your opinion is? Preferably with a low transaction fee. People here are saying Localcoin... is there something like Gildera that is safer more trustworthy?

This is what I see on Square’s site:
Bitcoin Exchange Rate
Your exchange rate for buying and selling Bitcoin through the Cash App is calculated using the current market rate across the most popular U.S. exchanges, plus a spread determined by the size of your transaction and market volatility. The exchange rate may differ between transactions, and may also differ from exchange rates available to you from other buyers and sellers of Bitcoin.
Conversion Fees
You are not charged a conversion fee, or any other fees, to buy or sell Bitcoin through the Cash App.

Yeah I’m just curious and learning at the moment so wanted to put a few bucks in.. I have BRD and last night got to the point of inputting my bank account info with Gildera/Kraken and just didn’t feel comfortable handing out my bank account login info... hence why I’m at an ATM. So they are known to be more expensive?

Yeah I thought that but I mean would it just charge a fee? This just says the price is X amount with no disclaimer about an adjusted price...
