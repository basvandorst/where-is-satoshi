Never give a private key to anything that isn’t well know for a long time and that isn’t open source. You shouldn’t just find random services and start throwing around private keys regardless of how “legit” they look. Have you confirmed the source code? Do you know where it’s sending your private key or how it’s storing it?

Is this your first kid? Word of advice, read a parenting book instead. Or rub your wife’s feet/back/pressure points while she’s contracting. Not only will you get major brownie points from the Mrs but you’ll learn something you’ll need way ahead of time :-)
Definitely read this 10/10 book, but not in front of the Mrs while she’s giving birth.

Seems like the resell of hardware is your key component to profitability. Aren't you afraid that the re-sell market will change for one reason or another? That could cripple you.

Are you worried about your immediate family using the clues to track down your private keys while you're still alive? Would you notice?

Are you banking on Bitcoin price rising for profitability? If so, put $10k into BTC instead of miners. Less risk ;-)

Did someone hijack your account? What did the transactions say? Did you look at the login history? Did you have 2FA enabled?

Did you allow the API to withdrawal? Or did it somehow trade your money away?
