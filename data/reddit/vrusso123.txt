Thank you. I am a tile installer, the money to buy did not come easy. I figured if I drive this shitty truck for one more year them coins were pretty much free. If bitcoin does what I believe it will do, the truck will be free. ;)

making sure you saw this &gt; So, I cleaned out the Iphone. new IOS. it now only connects to internet when I use wi-fi. So, if I put bitwallet on it, link it to my encrypted Qt wallet which I believe is still secure(?), save my private keys elsewhere, and remove all traces of Qt  and keys from my computer, would I not have a secure cold storage device?
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:57:27
   I am a frequent customer of Panera Bread, and love your food. As Millions of others world wide are doing (for security of information, anonymity, fraud protection, and general ease of use), I have decided to start using Bitcoin as my payment method of choice. As I understand, implementing this new and exiting internet currency will save your company 2-3% of transaction fees with 0% chargebacks and can VERY easily be added to your new Kiosk System.
   We in the bitcoin community would love to add you to the growing list of more than 10,000 companies where we can spend our bitcoin. Hopefully we will see a "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sign in your window soon!
                                         Sincerely, 
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:32:39

   considering accepting Bitcoin as a payment option? There are a lot of us (bitcoiners) who are waiting to SPEND our bitcoin on the things we need, rather than sell them for fiat currency to purchase goods and services. It would be great to add you to a growing list of merchants that are now accepting bitcoin as payment.
                       Sincerely -

@_date: 2014-05-02 22:14:02
why would we want "our" currency tied to "their" crap?

"Since your Qt keys were generated on an online computer, even if you store your private keys someplace else (printing them out and backing up to encrypted USB stick), and then delete the Qt wallet, it's technically not cold storage. Cold storage keys have never touched a computer connected to the internet. You're probably okay with doing that, but just be aware of the difference. "
thanks, didn't know the difference.
"You could then send a portion of your Qt funds to each paper wallet, load the public addresses into bitwallet, AND THEN just load the private keys when you feel like spending them"
hmmm....could I load a private key from a picture stored in the phone?

can paper wallets be encrypted with a passphrase? would that "seal the deal"?
