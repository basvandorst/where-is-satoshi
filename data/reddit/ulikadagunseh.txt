Yea, lots of people here threatened the judge on the DPR case with death, and there were no penalties.

Cash.  100% of my cash transfers are free.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:29:48
is a subreddit devoted to people purchasing illicit goods entirely with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:30:09
Hahaha!  They spent as much on weed as on food?  Omg, that's so incredible.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:15:29
Because adult porn isn't illegal in most developed countries and doesn't need to be traded on the deep web.
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:57:29
Funny you say that, because I'm rich.  I'm not some broke struggling college dipshit hoarding imaginary money.
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:43:40
People suck, and because bitcoin relies almost exclusively on the honestly of random people, it also sucks.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:02:53
Without the internet or a phone, you obviously cannot.
@_date: 2014-12-25 09:18:05
You really think Americans want heroin and meth 100% legal?  You are delusional, in high school, or both.
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:29:58
The FBI?
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:07:53
Your downvotes indicate otherwise.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:37:27
@_date: 2014-09-13 20:48:46
This obviously fake story has 115 upvotes.  So sad.  
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:56:24
But take these pennies first.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:27:18
That author is an idiot.  How did he think that a place like Thailand would even be able to exchange Brazilian currency?  Why didn't you exchange the money before even leaving in the first place?  Who the hell travels to another country with so little preparation? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:34:01
16 upvotes for this trash.
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:25:54
Because he's in the business of making money, not losing it.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:31:09
Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:18:24
Ah, yes.  The Wimpy defense:  "I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a humburger today."
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:41:24
I don't bother to pick up a penny on the ground, I'm not going to bother to pick up the penny you gave me on the internet.
@_date: 2014-12-25 09:19:48
Why don't you poll college age students and ask how many of them support heroin and meth being 100% legal.  Do you really think you're going to get a positive response?
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:22:53
Actually, saving money IS in a way bad for the economy.  Consumers need to be spending to keep the economy going.
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:46:48
You realize that no one is going to take that seriously, right?
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:58:19


You sure?  You could throw more pennies at OP.
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:57:17


But one million didn't.  Just one did.  
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:14:19
That thread still has over 450 upvotes, BTW.
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:07:16
You could have just said; "no."  
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:18:09
Buttcoiner here.  Thanks for the laughs!
@_date: 2014-12-25 09:20:38
Give out free heroin?
@_date: 2015-05-17 04:39:46
Why does this embarrassing shit even have upvotes?
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:45:16
You mean like many of the people in this sub?
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:33:30
Because Silk Road was created EXCLUSIVELY for illegal goods?
@_date: 2014-11-30 08:06:14
Fortunately, they allow refunds with other forms of payment, like bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-13 20:47:16
You guys are eating it up, that's for sure.
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:12:54
We have black people, therefore healthcare don't work?
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:15:11
Nobel Prizes don't real.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:07:45
You guys just haven't modified the wiki page enough yet.  Keep working on it.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:03:55


It sure was. /s

It should be illegal to compare anything to Hitler that isn't Hitler.
@_date: 2015-05-02 14:35:45
That Jeep didn't cost that much new.
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:38:31
Scammers?  On my forums?  
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:34:58


You underestimate the gullibility of bitcoiners.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:10:58
Because bitcoin's strength is decided entirely on comments from reddit.
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:27:28
Of course.  Half of all redditors are afflicted with the deadly/genius creating disease.
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:15:27
Wow, that's just fucking awful.  
@_date: 2015-05-11 07:51:43
This is just ludicrous.  How does any sane person think this dumb shit will ever be widely adopted?
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:27:08
So, it wasn't in OP's local paper?  OP is a liar!
@_date: 2014-12-25 09:14:16
So, heroin should be 100% legal?  You realize that like 95% of Americans disagree with that, right?
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:35:51
Victim blaming?  Nice.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:15:00


Only when you guys get ripped off do you ever care about the government's role in something.  Too funny.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:54:43
Pretty sure a dream world has no perpetrators.
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:27:26
No, that's guns.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:45:51


He's not wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:08:38
The Chinese miners were the primary beneficiaries in the early years.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:36:52
If you have bitcoin, it's not a question of if you'll lose your money, but when. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:26:26
The fact that this thread already had zero karma didn't stop me from downvoting it again anyway.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:11:21
You're Chinese?
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:28:13
All the stolen bitcoins were returned?  Haha, just kidding.  That never happens.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:10:30
Buttcoiner here.  I just really hate scams and people that circumvent laws, so obviously, Bitcoin is in my sights.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:12:12
This requirement is bullshit.
