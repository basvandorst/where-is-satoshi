Lol it's public knowledge that Bank Santander has a whole blockchain lab and has released multiple blockchain apps. Banks are pro blockchain and everyone working on it knows where it comes from (Bitcoin in case you don't know), look at pics of their lab online, it's full of logos of different cryptocurrencies.

 \&gt;  Chances of this are extremely low.   
Chances are extremely low in mining as well, the important thing is the resources you have to invest and the potential reward for investing those resources, if BTC grows in price and cost of brute forcing goes down, this will become profitable.  
\&gt; They are wasting time.   
So is playing the lottery, I was just making an example of people doing it right now.  
\&gt; There will be no reason to get keys because they will be protecting worthless tokens. As in zero dollars and zero cents.   
This is incorrect as well since only old funds are vulnerable and people will need to invest high amount of resources just like in mining.  
\&gt;  It doesn't increase unless the whole signing scheme is replaced. **Hard fork**.   
This is again incorrect, a new signing algo is being included into bitcoin soon through a soft fork (Schnorr), and there are plans already to increase the key size or schema preparing for more powerful computers.  
\&gt; The last paragraph is pretty much complete garbage.  
I´m sorry if you don´t like it, but it´s true! most bitcoin since early 2012 is not vulnerable to quantum computers.  
You can ask questions (Me or outside) and do your research about it.  
In general, spouting something is garbage to people you don´t know just because you don´t understand how it works tends not to be the best approach to have a conversation. I´m just an engineer trying to teach what little I know to people.

You are right, it's not clear:

It sounds more complex and I fail to see the advantage.

That´s the challenge of consensus, finding a way among those 50 to agree on a single block. I assumed they used BFT consensus for that, to do that they need to communicate with each other. In summary, you would need a way for those 50 to produce a single block most of the time, ideally without communication and without using a clock.  
Miners´ role is to order transactions, they validate them in order to properly order them. You would still need a decentralized way to decide which transactions to include in which order, that´s the challenge. Otherwise I could spend the same UTXO with 2 people and to each of them their transaction might have arrived first, which would be valid?
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:36:53
No wait, I see a use case:  
If someone bans me from connecting to your IP, I can pay someone to route my message successfully.  
Cool!  
Mmmm but I think with the current implementation they would be able to read the message without accepting the amount, therefore the router wouldn´t get payed :/   
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:56:20
What? You can run a full node right now on Bitcoin without mining, that´s the recommended behavior, there is no need to change anything to the consensus to achieve that.  
Some (most) people don´t because it´s harder and more expensive than an SPV
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:11:33
PoW is not a consensus mechanism. Your intentions are good, but I think you don´t have full visibility about the problem you are trying to solve.  
Here are some points (I haven´t finished your post, there might be more things):  
Your solution reduces scalability and requires computers to have a synced clock  
Forces some nodes to be online  
Gives all the power forever to some addresses  
Your assumption that all nodes must be full is incorrect  
You don´t define how the consensus between those 50 works  
First seen rules are not proper for a decentralized consensus because of the latency between nodes  
But the main thing that people seem to miss is that they think Bitcoin mining is a waste, it is not, the resources spent on it make it harder to attack. In order to protect the network with a PoS system (Really similar to what you explain) you would need to spend the same amount of resources in cost of opportunity.  
Miners in your system would need to have a high opportunity cost to be in the top 1000 wallets, and therefore still demand the block reward if we want to achieve better security.
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:03:16
This is incorrect, not how the cryptography behind BTC works
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:21:07
" If a transaction is found in all 5 blocks you can take that tx is as good as in the current BTC model. "   
This is not how the current model works  
" If there is conflicting, ie double spends in those block you would obviously need to wait to see who builds on which block to see where that funds should go. "  
You can´t do this if you have an undefined number of forks every round, you will have as many forks as "Connected wallets" every round never reaching consensus. Look into how the nakamoto consensus works  
" NOT have block rewards anymore as they are not needed. " They are needed to protect the network, if you create a system where there are no rewards, attacking the network would be trivial.
 1) less carbon emissions   
Almost all miners use green electricity since the cost per KW is cheaper or use excess energy from main producers. You could use a PoS but it´s unsafer and costs the same amount.
  2) halting coin inflation  
There is no inflation, the supply is already defined, the existing supply is being distributed through mining but no more will be produced
 3) increasing security    
It´s much less secure because as is, anyone can create their own chain/selfish mine and fully censor blocks and double spend without any risk or cost (This is why we need rewards)
4) PoW is not needed if everyone validates  
It is not needed, we can use other sybil resistan mechanisims, but we need a way to agree in the order of transactions, your system doesn´t solve that yet
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:41:43
I don´t get how you are trying to challenge the "everyone should be validating in a POW chain". Care to elaborate?  
Everyone should be validating everything in an ideal world, I don´t see how your solution makes the validating process any easier. It sounded like a different way to reach consensus.
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:42:25
What I´m trying to say is that the initial premise of the article is not correct.  
If you lose the key to your bitcoins or send them to an account that doesn´t exist they are not lost forever. Therefore they can be sold just as soon as they are accessible.
Related to your comment:  
Since this can happen anytime you can´t account them as priced in long term any more than any other storage right?

Stratum v2 gives end miners the possibility to mine their own block instead of mining one proposed by the pool.  
How do you think this will affect the mining centralization concerns?
What´s the practical performance difference of using this system?
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:01:38
Experience tell us this is not always true. There were times where pools had over 50% of power and people didn´t changed pools. The pool itself asked people to disconnect and at the end the pool had to kick them off the network (Never in BTC).   
Slush has some graphs around their individual miners, hashrate and geographical distribution ([ and yes, the top 10 miners have more power than the rest, and HW manufacturing seems like the hardest problem to solve.

Ok you win, I´ll stop talking, your statements are wrong, and you are being rude.  
1 I´ve contributed to the design and implementation of new cryptographic schemas for distributed solutions.  
2 The address space is much much bigger than 50M, but it doesn´t matter, the address space is not used when performing these attacks  
3 The vector of attack of quantum computers won´t compromise most bitcoin users.  
Now you could have tried to ask questions, learn about how things really work, or maybe teach me something. But instead you were rude and repeated things you´ve heard online being rude to other people.  
Really hope some day you realize where that attitude is taking you, farewell!

How? it´s just a pic without resources, am I missing something or are we really this gullible? lol
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:39:46
Not gonna follow up on this further, those are all things you can do your own research on:  
Scalability is reduced because you require a group of people communicating in order to produce a block, and in order to know when the next block should be produced, they need to have their clocks in sync. Research further into sybil resistant mechanisms to learn why.  
The point is that you are giving block creation power to a set of addresses with lots of bitcoin, this leads to centralized mining, if you are a block producer, you won´t sell and you will hoard more bitcoin, creating a barrier of entry to new miners. Research on PoS to learn why and how can this happen.  
I was saying that the word MUST there is incorrect, with your system, you CAN run SVP nodes and they would still work
You have to define who among those 50 creates the block, maybe one of them prefers tx1 instead of tx2, you need consensus.
@_date: 2019-11-25 08:30:47
Not that easy.  
It´s based off IPFS, which is coded in go and js, neither of which are default mobile languages (You can run JS with some tweaking).  
Haven doesn´t use IPFS you are accessing a centralized server when you use it.
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:03:56
I probably am, I don´t get the gist of the idea yet, and I fail to see who creates the block between those 50, and how that entity is selected.  
BTW the reason the block rewards are there are to protect the network, if I´m getting 10btc I´ll gladly spend 9 in electricity or opportunity costs, if there is no reward, I won´t spend anything on protecting it. Someone else with a higher incentive to attack than the current rewards could successfully attack the network.  
Simplified example: If 500.000 were invested in the mining process in the hour, I need to invest 500.001 an hour to attack the network, if there is no reward, attacking would be much cheaper.  
Your intentions are great, you will find a ton of people pushing you down but keep thinking and you may come up with some cool stuff!
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:51:52
Seems heavily inspired on it.  
This solves some technical challenges like the performance loss of the pool verifying everyone´s block before the miners can actually start mining.
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:45:04
Why would you do that instead of directly connecting to the node and directly sending a message?  
Cool app and experiment thou!
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:54:54
By definition, you are not reaching consensus, if everyone in the network creates their own blocks and they are all orphaned there is not communication either.  
If you have multiple orphans per block every round, how do you expect reaching consensus long term?  
This is why every other PoS system has a way to identify a provable single producer most of the time.  
Still, I don´t see the problem we are solving here, even if this idea is developed and worked, what´s the advantage? We still need to pay block rewards and verify all transactions in full nodes to be 100% safe
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:21:06
Nope that´s a common misconception.  
You can find a key which generates an existing address and control the funds in that address, it doesn´t even have to be the same original key (Although most of the time it is).  
There are people right now generating keys, hoping they find one which can control "locked" funds. You can even rent "key mining attempts" in some markets to try and get control over one of Satoshi´s addresses!
As computers get more powerful, this process will become faster and people will be able to recover old locked funds more easily. This won´t affect regular users since the key length increases faster than the rate at which a an address can be brute forced. 
In essence, if you lose your key, or send to an address which doesn´t exist, those bitcoins are not lost forever. In the future either because your lost BTC are worth a lot or gaining control over your address is really simple, someone will recover them.
As a side note, quantum computers won´t affect this process since the vast majority of btc funds are protected from quantum computers attacks (Another common misconception). If you use any popular wallet since 2012 a traditional computer will likely always be a bigger threat than a quantum one.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:05:30
You are almost right, miners don´t matter on this context full nodes do.
Full nodes, (end users) would need to fork to keep their assets on a different chain, but this leads to a different asset, and a huge drop in the value of that new asset, at least for a while.
And you are right, attacking the network by running miners maliciously is really expensive and you will probably lose most of your investment on the attack.
The real problem is that there is close to no cost for china to take control of the pools.
We can fix this with decentralized block selection, instead of the pool deciding the block and everyone mining on it. Betterhash!!
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:59:23
You are wrong again, with more than 50% of the network they can produce a longer chain and censor all the blocks from the 49%...  
The assumption comes due to the usefulness of the net being reduced because is controlled by china, and the reduced security because the 49% of miners would stop mining since they can´t publish any blocks. This is a common assumption in the community, if this doesn´t happen, it´s even more profitable to perform this attack for them.  
But as stated before, most people don´t change their pool, we´ve seen this even in cases of several networks, and pools, usually it´s honest pools who have to drop the miners.  
This is all fixed with betterhash!
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:34:02
They are working on new solutions anonymous  by default, but you can create anonymous transactions already by using second layer or coinjoins

I agree with you.  
What other bitcoiners would say is: There is too much mining hardware in the world, you can´t just buy more than the existing hashrate because there aren´t that many machines in the world. (I don´t think this is right)  
Another difference is that theoretically, if you print x amount of currency, it should devalue proportionally. And china could probably take over the pools without spending currency.

You are wrong, China can successfully attack the network and earn profit while doing so.  
They can block all transactions which is around 1-10% of the reward they are losing and still claim the coinbase profits.  
As price goes down so does the cost of their attack, after some time they can stop, and as soon as people start using it and trusting it sell everything and start all over again.   
This way China only loses a potential 1-10% potential profit, since sizing the control of pools is almost free to them, while making 90% of the profit the pools are making right now.  
Also channels are not a real solution, since most of the capital tends to flow one way in them (Most people don´t get payed in lightning) and NFC bills are a horrible solution prone to double spend.
The true way to protect against this is not a hard fork or a new hashing algorithm, its expanding the use of betterhash.
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:31:57
Just to be clear about this:  
Libra is not owned or controlled by facebook.  
Libra is just a mixture between BTC and ETH (More eth).  
Libra says they will go permissionless in 5 years (Sounds like propaganda but they are trying).  
You can have pseudo-anonymus identities just like ETH, or use second layer similar to lightning for fungibility and privacy.
You own your keys.  
It's essentially a bcash where a limited number of corporations control the mining and it's purpose is b2b transactions, in the future it might even be backed by bitcoin.  
This can help some people in countries with unstable currencies who need something easy for day to day use. This will familiarize people with how bitcoin works, and once libra has any problem, will flock people to BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:12:38
The number of transactions per block is very loosely connected to the price. They do follow a similar pattern, but is much less affected by price changes. A price increase from 2.000 to 20.000 means less than a 20% increase on transactions per block. A price decrease from 20.000 to 3.600 means a decrease of less than 20%

I don't think you understand how fiat cash is traced.  
**AML and KYC are limited around cash and it's your burden to prove where you got them from. You can do the exact same thing with private bitcoin**. There is no need to have a global record where all the transactions are recorded in the same manner that we/governments don't need a global record where all the transactions are recorded.  
**I can hide my cash the same way I can hide my bitcoin, but no entity will accept a big payment unless I can prove it's provenance,** they perform an AML check on the money and a KYC on me.  
Please notice that I'm exclusively comparing **bitcoin to fiat cash** from the beginning not "money".

I agree, Facebook is worse than ViaBTC, no contest there.

From the writers perspective (Izabella Kaminska):  
1. Cryptocurrency supporters don't like to admit that their services are highly unfriendly.  
This major error, next to price volatility, exposure to scams and affiliation with the black market hold back on mass adoption, there is a lack of self awareness.  
2. Transaction fees are increasing, someone told me that you can pay less fees if you configure it. But no one is going to do that. Money isn't money unless its cheap to move on a microtransaction basis, and there everything remains conflicting.
3. I tried to pay 19$ in BTC and ended up paying 3.1$ in fees, even thou I overrode the system in order to pay less fees because it usually would be 5$.
4. In other news, visa is creating their own blockchain based solution B2B Connect. Is not descentralized and they are doing it for PR for a public which doesn't care.
She clearly doesn't understand a lot about BTC, how it works or how to use it, but she is the voice that most day to day people will hear...
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:04:20
You assume that global adoption means bitcoin being worth 1M$. People can and should be able to operate with fractions of a satoshi.
You are under the assumption that the current system to manage money is less wasteful, when accounting **only for energy**, is already around 3 times more expensive than bitcoin. (28.6TW for bitcoin vs an estimated 100TW for banks). 
About the 51% attack, more price means more reward which means more incentives to do the attack, but you are missing out on the fact that more price by default means more miners which means more network safety. The more expensive a bitcoin is, the safer the network is.  
Finally, something that is not very talked about nowadays, there are estimations by several developers from different teams saying that right now, the security of the network is too high for the requirements of the network, mostly because the limit of SHA256 based PoW is very close to being a physical limit, there is no need to have so many miners.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:55:38
I don't disagree on the concept, I'm just saying that the number seems arbitrary. It would be really interesting if someone came up with the number.  
Bitcoin energy consumption doesn't need to increase, the network is already uber safe, many core devs agree.  
With time, as the block subsidy lower, so will energy consumption, taking in account that the subsidy is around 80-90% of the reward now, we can expect a decent lowering of the hash power. Every 4 years, the profit of miners and hash power should heavily decrease.
The 100TW is only the energy consumed by banks in moving money, it doesn't include other services or salaries from all the people that are dedicated to it. There is likely an overlap with other services, but then again, I'm only accounting for electricity consumption and banks do many other processes.  
The problem with miners and unexpected hashpower growth came because of asics, now, since the hashing process can no longer be optimised in any way but making the dye smaller, we have 2 consequences:  
1. A ton of mining machines (Which means that the appearance of 51% of extra machines dedicated to mine btc is close to impossible)  
2. A lowering on the price which means that people in the future be able to mine at 0 profit and use the miners as machines with other functionality IE: heaters  
To attack the network with 49% of the hashpower and undo one block, although possible if you are lucky, you risk to lose more than half a million dollars, and you will lose that amount them most of the time, it's likely that you will make more just by acting honestly.
