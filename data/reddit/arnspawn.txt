Works for me 
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:57:24
I'm addicted to buying BTC too. Gave up on a new car and some holidays... Quit smoking and stop buying crap things, just living much simpler life.
Going to Portugal tomorrow so wish me good holiday, don't give up on everything, have some btc and have some fun too.

You can use coinbase pro on mobile, just have to use Web browser

If you send euro to bitstamp from revoult it will take about 24 hours to be able to use your funds, with coinbase it is few days longer that's why I don't use coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:13:49
Since they moved their account to Estonia I have to wait few days for money to be transfered and minimum amount is 1000£, I'm talking about coinbase pro.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:17:03
Not long ago top was 9000! now 10000 is the bottom? Smell bull run babe

In Formans basement.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:33:19
What about bitstamp in the UK? What's wrong with it?
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:35:11
Good luck , if I would have two houses I would put one on sale myself
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:07:20
I would buy but im afraid btc is going deeper. My faith is fading.
@_date: 2018-08-19 19:17:54
what merc is this ?
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:05:22
Well I trade some btc on gdax, should I stop? I'm getting some small profits but never though about coinbase like you, I think you right.

Will be easier to talk about bitcoin to other people when btc goes to new ath
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:26:32

What is karma ? Ive got over 100
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:37:20
My top is 20k, is where I brought.
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:41:42
Ledger nano
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:36:15
How taxman knows how did I spend 10k, it simply go out of my account and after few months is back again. Btc gains is on ledger nano and only I know I've got it. Isn't that right? Or government track every movement of my money?
@_date: 2019-06-14 00:04:52
Never heard of him. Now all of them old farts who are scared of bitcoin will be saying stuff like this. So easy to ignore them xD
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:21:03
They enjoy their lives I guess..
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:49:35
My first buy was around 16k , this month may be the first green month since Im into bitcoin. Never give up , hodl
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:03:38
They moved to Estonia and now I use bitstamp.
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:05:38
Thank You Sir!
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:01:20
I feel like im in green too! bought at ATH and was buying since. Feels good man!
@_date: 2019-02-24 12:10:48
You have 2 btc there, looks like 2500 a piece ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:18:35
If I bought bitcoin for 10k and 3 months later I sell some bitcoin and send my 10k to my bank account , do I pay tax on it ? The bitcoin leftover will be my gain which I keep.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:28:09
Do I have to have lighting node to use apps like this ?
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:04:59
Done both ����
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:41:55
Well sometimes I'm stressed more than 5 days a month becouse of bitcoin. But your right, spend a bit of money on clubbing and some restaurants and buy a bit bitcoin, balance is the key.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:47:14
what phone is that?
@_date: 2019-12-23 09:11:50
Thanks for reminding me that I will be reach soon ☺️
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:33:57
I told my brother about bitcoin yet he does not own any. He knows about halving and he told me he will buy some around march. Do you think there is a lot of people like him to buy just before halving? I think there will be plenty.

@_date: 2019-04-05 18:34:25

@_date: 2019-04-23 11:56:48
I've only sold fiat so far, I may buy some back if I need. I am glad I don't belong to people like you xD
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:01:47
I hope to break even, never mind 100k$
@_date: 2019-12-08 19:07:14
to be on a green side
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:37:21
Is this representing mining power? Fuk me I know so little about bitcoin. I might consider some book or something, is bitcoin standard book explain all?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:41:27
At what price we will be on the Moon ? and what price on Mars ?
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:55:31
I bought at ATH , I dont want to buy at next ATH anymore
This is good price for me, dont know about you. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:19:02
Even I know more about bitcoin than people who made the video. 
That makes me happy.
@_date: 2019-04-30 01:28:52
So to buy something you have to pay fee + some to coinbase and moon as well? If so that's a step back and fking joke
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:10:52
Maybe you never had a mortgage.

@_date: 2019-04-26 19:37:46

@_date: 2019-04-08 01:08:55
Higher price will attract more people thus faster adoption.

Hi, I use coinbase only, what's the reasons you talk about? I have never used any other exchange, maybe with your help I will leave coinbase.
Thank you.

I have checked Bitrefill, I can buy giftcard for amazon and then used it. Whats the point of that when I can just pay with visa on amazon website.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:51:29
My funds was on hold for 5 days before I could transfer it to coinbase pro. So you have to wait about 5 days
@_date: 2019-05-08 06:02:31

They must have changed something past couple of weeks becouse not long ago I transfer money straight from my online banking to coinbase pro and received it within 3 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:31:17
I don't need lambo too, I said I would like to have one, why not.. But I have a lot of more important things to spend money on, lambo would be the last thing on shopping list. Love lambo
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:56:02
I can't believe it will be that easy to turn few k to few hundreds k, are we really such early adopters or what? If I tell somebody that they always think is a scam.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:57:31
How did you started btm businesses? How did you get permission to put bitcoin machine inside airport?
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:37:02

Well today I sent 100gbp to coinbase pro and I received 100 within 1 hour, so if I got 100gbp on coinbase pro then I didn't pay any fees did I? Unless anything changed past few hours that I'm not aware of.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:22:28
