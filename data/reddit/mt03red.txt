Our economy is structured around ever increasing consumption. People exist to serve the economy, not the other way around. We destroy our environment and work far more than we need to, just to keep the economy growing so that rich people can keep getting richer. It's a trap our parents and grandparents accepted because they didn't know any better.
With a deflationary currency we won't need an ever growing economy. Rich people can just hoard money instead. People will be incentivized to only buy what they need and save the rest of their money for later. Better for our environment and the consumers.

You mean if its price was pegged to USD, the inflationary currency?
Bitcoin needs incentive to make up for its risk and to drive adoption. It can't do what it does without adoption and it wouldn't reach a critical mass of adoption if it didn't provide strong incentives for users to get on board.
It also provides freedom from inflation as part of its freedom from the banking system. That's one of its features, that its value isn't subject to a hidden tax on capital imposed by corrupt and/or incompetent politicians and bankers.
Of course I intend to get rich. Don't you?
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:39:43
Productivity will keep increasing because automation makes everything cheaper to produce. Housing gets more expensive because too many want to live in cities that are already overcrowded, driving prices up. Food gets more expensive because of inflation. We only really need food and housing. In relative terms we spend less of our money on food and more on housing and other things than before.
There is enough food in the world to feed everyone, if we would just distribute it more fairly. The reason people work so hard is not because the world needs their productivity, it's because the world *doesn't* need their productivity. Wages are low which means they need to work more to pay for the things they need.
Bitcoin won't solve all these problems alone but we are going to need a new economic system that isn't based on the value of human labor.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:55:49
Bitcoin. Based on the long-term patterns and upcoming halving we can expect another speculative bubble next year some time. We may pass 30k this year in anticipation of that bubble.

Think about it. Those with good education get good jobs with good pay and more vacation and can retire early if they save. Most people have little education and unless they're very lucky they will be paid very little for their work. That forces them to work long hours and sometimes more than one job to provide for their families and can not expect an early retirement. If their productivity had been in demand they would have been paid more for it.


I fully agree with this. However, there is a point for each person where more wealth does not improve their quality of life. Many in the middle class have already reached that point. If the trend continues with ever bigger middle class and fewer living in poverty, we will reach a point where more growth is a net negative on people's overall quality of life.


Yes. Wealth tends to concentrate at the top (trickle-up economics).


I'm not so sure about that. Inflation favors those with large low interest debts. That requires lots of collateral and enough income to service the debt. Poor people don't have much collateral and their debt tends to be high interest debt. Inflation also enables governments to print money (or rather is a result of it) and the governments don't tend to give that money to those who need it most, instead they give it to the rich and pretend that somehow benefits the poor (trickle-down economics).

1. The real cost of manufacturing goods has decreased due to productivity gains from automation and moving production to low-cost countries. This has been canceled out by QE.
2. Housing and stock prices have ballooned, making the rich richer.
3. Wage growth has been low, keeping the poor poor.
@_date: 2019-03-29 02:23:59
When debt spirals out of control, the market solves it by crashing. When central banks prevent the crash by inflating away the debt, the problem keeps getting worse while the solution is postponed.
Constant economic growth is not natural nor desirable. The economic status quo is a disease, and the QE scheme is simply a way for the rich to get richer while pretending everything is fine.

There is quiet optimism now that we seem to be on the rise but the real hype mania hasn't started yet. Compared to last time I think bitcoin has more media attention and especially more serious, positive and qualified media attention, where last time there were lots of jokes made about it and almost nobody in mainstream finance had any real clue at all.
I expect the sentiment to continue to build gradually as the price climbs to 20k and beyond, and probably turn into another big FOMO rally like we've seen many times before.

It took years from I first heard of it until I looked closer at what it actually was and decided to buy some. And I'm a tech savvy person. The halving will happen and most people who have heard of bitcoin won't even hear about the halving, or if they do it'll just be a blurb on the evening news saying the price has reached new highs but they won't wonder what the halving is because they don't care enough about tech/finance to even be a little curious about bitcoin.

This here is the correct answer. USD M2 has increased around 6% annually since the late 90's.

Native Americans were outcompeted by European invaders. The Europeans were able to do that because they had greater numbers and better technology, as a result of higher population density, as a result of producing more food, as a result of farming.

The market cap is simply the current price multiplied by how many there are in total. The price is determined by what people are willing to pay for it and what people are willing to sell it for.

Purchasing power isn't tied to any specific currency, you made that point yourself. If 1 bitcoin buys 1 unit of something, the price of that something in USD or EUR or JPY is irrelevant.
However in a situation when all fiat currencies experience hyperinflation, people will convert to alternative means of payment such as cryptocurrency. In that case cryptocurrency's purchasing power will increase because the same amount of coins will be used to facilitate more economic activity.

Media will write anything that people will click on. Bullish articles get clicks, bearish articles get clicks. They write them whenever they have the slightest excuse.
At least it's better than them not writing about Bitcoin at all.

Yes Electrum is good but there is one particularly insidious attack that people have lost money to on older versions, where a message will pop up in the Electrum client telling users to upgrade and sending the users to a link with a hacked version that steals their coins.
As always be very careful about security.

Lightning doesn't have enough adoption yet. Before it can get mainstream adoption it needs more early adopters to pave the way.

If you're just an average person, or even an average rich person, bitcoin is more than liquid enough for you. But for the extremely rich, bitcoin's limited liquidity is an issue. It also means that when big players buy or sell, the price moves a lot. That's great for traders who love volatility but it also means bitcoin isn't a mature and predictable store of value like gold is.

I think at some point people are going to keep bitcoins in their bank accounts. The great thing about bitcoin is that we have the option of being our own bank, but since most users don't want to be their own bank we need both options to be viable.
