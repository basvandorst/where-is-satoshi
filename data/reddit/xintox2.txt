if supply and demand were the only factors and demand is high...
the problem is you can't predict the demand on something like bitcoin. The blockchain concept is valuable, but so far only as a concept. Companies getting into it are building their own or even building the open blockchain. I hear very little mentioning of Bitcoin in these articles...so I guess you could by the coins and use them online. There will probably always be a demand for that to some extent. But I don't think Bitcoin will ever become more than a fringe crypto currency that only cryptogeeks use.

@_date: 2016-01-15 01:34:17
probably could be some calculation on the number of transactions per second and block size to figure out how many nodes are needed....this could be a self adjusting algorithm that enforces fees....if you start controlling more than .01% or whatever the number would be, your fees start going down.

i used gentoo for a few years. i was on alpha branch so i was spending weekends and nights just updating shit. it was always a drag everytime a linux kernel came out. My boss bought me a mac w/o asking me and i used it for about a month before i realized the time saved was worth every penny.
It would be nice to switch back to OSS But there are apps I need that simply won't work w/ no alternative on linux.

Freedom Block -- i like it! one of the core principles is the more computing power you hold the less fees  you get....if you control less than .01% of the freedom block your fees go up --- if you control over .01% your fees start going down.

well for starters some knuckle head managed to convince everyone that people would want to use Bitcoin (a digital currency)....no....not online...but at a fucking brick-and-mortor store. I don't know why, there has been this huge failed attempt at promoting bitcoin at brick-and-mortor for the past 3 years.
The only reason I use it is to purchase things online in which I'd rather not divulge my personal information or credit card.
Lately that's been mostly servers and streaming sites that offer an alternative to cable.
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:03:52
@_date: 2016-01-03 05:44:32


I LOL'd


This whole focus on Bitcoin for brick-and-mortar never did make any sense to me. It's a digital currency...use it for digital products.


Sounds like these guys have no idea how to run a business. Don't understand their product's applicable use cases nor their target market. A super bowl? c'mon. You should have sponsored a World of Warcraft tournament.

I would use it but I need shit to work, which means your left with just mac.
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:08:03


that's why i stopped using linux.
but i was considering switching back. i need a new laptop and i don't want to pay for a mac. its nice, but you're right gnome is pretty sweet now. The only problem is I use sketch and do iOS dev which you simply cannot do on linux.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:36:32
Because they aren't an exchange?
@_date: 2016-02-04 22:55:56
i'll check that one out. i just found the one i was thinking of: 
@_date: 2016-02-26 06:40:34
you could mail the private key to the wallet I suppose. but why not just use an escrow service?
also you're better off using an exchange than eBay.

its interesting you came to that conclusion on your own though. but i have to say, on all the groups/teams i've worked on, none of them could have produced something on this level. I feel like it was a lone wolf who brought people in as it grew.
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:50:32
I started watching it seriously at $4. When it went to $9 I signed up for coinbase. By the time I was verified I bought at $32.

 - also buying them is usually not anonymous unless you go to a meetup. However you can transfer them to your own wallet which doesn't need to be tied to id.
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:30:41
god damn. of course. this will be the cause of the next crash then it'll be another 2 years of nonsense.
