Lol Bitcoin is $5k and people are talking about going down with the ship. It was $900 last year.

I think once it proves it has some staying power you'll see far more, and better, ways to buy and trade bitcoins. 
For me, and my small mind, I think bitcoins success hinges on whether it is accepted by a major retailer in short order. With lesser transaction fees, someone like amazon could essentially solidify the market by not only accepting bitcoins, but also passing part of the savings on to the client.
Plus there are the niche markets. Don't underestimate the illegal stuff. Anonymous currency has a wide range of uses that range from buying presents you don't want anyone to know about, to illegal goods, prostitution, etc. 
But that's my peace. mtg.ox controls the market only in a sense that if their shitty servers can't handle or prevent ddos' or large trade amounts it'll cause a panic like we saw today. Eventually, they'll either improve or lose out to someone else.
It's still very early. Do I think it happens? Not overly optimistic. Is it possible? Very much so. And if BCs do become legitimate currency a single BC will be an extremely large amount of money.

Comparing a loan to a currency. 
You're not comparing apples to apples. It's like asking why pay for something with cash vs a credit card.

Not a bitcoin holder in any real way (I've mined 7 bit mills!) but I will go out on a limb and say they felt shitty. Real shitty.

I actually kind of expect another big dip. Rather, I hope (sorry guys) so I can buy it up. I kind of expect it to get to $50-60. I'll buy my coins and, in three years, I'll quietly retire to either Turkes or Caicos. Whichever.
People doubt the validity of illegal markets and anonymous currencies. Hell, specific hotel chains have become successful just because of how easy it is for prostitutes to host clients. 
The fact that illegal markets use it tells me that there are powerful individuals dedicated to making sure this is a success. Good enough for me.

This strikes me as someone who saw the computer in its original form and thought there would never be a use for it.
Yeah, the way computers used to be, nobody would ever need them. Then they got smaller, easier to use, and had a ton of features. This could be bitcoin. It could not be. But to dismiss it entirely is shortsighted.

This may be more prophetic than you know. 
A scary thought.

Prices at $220. Your boat might be turning back around. Just get on it this time, okay?

Even if they are we don't have the Fed giving them free bitcoin loans at 0% interest.
