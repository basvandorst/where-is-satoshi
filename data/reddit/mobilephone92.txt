Serious discussion point.
I'd be terrified if I was your everyday Bob from down the road.
The majority of people would be marginalised, only seeing Bitcon's (quite) bumpy past.
My point really, Is it going to be more a niche technology than as popular as say facebook.

If Gox have lost coins, then they should use the fees to make up this loss. They've made a fucking fortune over the past couple of years, they should pay up for their errors
But, you know full well it'll probably just be that they'll only let people have x% of the BTC eligible for withdrawals (it any at all)
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:04:58
Somebody decided to buy a big bunch of coins, this pushed the price up a little.
Onlookers jizzed their pants assuming that this slight increase signified good news (i.e. withdrawals resuming).
As such, BUY BUY BUY!

You're going to have to get some more content for people to become interested...
- Pay people per post to get some content/discussions going.
- Fake your own posts to make it look more lively.
Nobody is going to bother if you don't even explain what this is in your reddit submission...
Check out forums.digitalpoint.com for ideas to help get this going if you can invest the time and bitcoin.

From what I've read, the difficulty rate is based on the block generation average weighted across the previous blocks since the last change.
I.e. slowing down this close to a change would be like pissing in the wind.
Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
Also, 45 minutes may look like a long time, but in the next 20 minutes it could be that 5 blocks are found. All averages out over time. (Something I've witnessed a lot!)
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:51:00
In a week it has effectively gone from 200 to 400. I'm not quite sure how sustainable that is when there are still relatively few places to spend it (i.e. not yet mainstream.)
I'm not an economist, it's just my opinion and my reason for selling.
I hope it doesn't pop, because it would just be a feather in the cap of the naysayers. 
Also: I've made a nice bit of profit and would very much benefit from paying my credit card bill so that my credit rating doesn't get damaged as I would very much like to get a mortgage and a house soon.
If it wasn't for the above, I would've risked it.

In the UK we have something called Faster Payments.
Bank transfers and payments are instant, no matter the time of day, of if it is a public holiday.
Is there anything similar in the US?
It's stupid that banks don't process *automatic* digital transactions automatically. It's not as if somebody needs to click the 'OK' button for each and every one. How awfully archaic.

Seems as if block generation has slowed down massively.
The 7th block (on the front page of blockchain.info) was found 1 hour and 45 minutes ago. Approx 15 minutes per block. Which is hugely different to the average of 7-8 minutes per block it has been for the past few days.
Network hashing rate is currently 3,711TH/s (was c. 4,250TH/s last time I checked a couple days ago.)
Edit: 6 blocks found in 30 minutes. So, guess it all averages out over time. Really easy for panic to set in.

Wow, that's an annoying website (Having to like to read the article.)

Yeah, I withdrew £1000 from my paypal account last week, was in my bank account as soon as I hit refresh, about 5 seconds.

***Not sure if a coincidence***, but looks as if a lot of people disconnected their hardware before the difficulty increase, and then as soon as it happened everybody plugged in and we went up by 1.5 PH/s
It dips before the increase is due, then shoots up.
Are people not aware that the difficulty increase is based on the past blocks, and not the network speed at the time of the increase?
Ofcourse, it could just be the hardware shipping, but why the huge dip in the first place?

I sold at $365.
I may be wrong, and to be honest I'm not that bothered if I am, but it sure looks like it's gonna pop. Maybe not as bad as April, but it has gone up more than 100% in less than a week.
I may be downvoted for saying it, but at least my fiat is safe. If it does keep going up, good for those that took the risk.
I can't afford to take the risk. If you can afford it, best of luck! :)

Unless you're going to guarantee you received your order the next day, I wouldn't bother. And you'd have to be going in at about 1TH/s, or it wouldn't be worth the risk.
The rate at which difficulty is increasing (exponentially!) then the amount of bitcoin you mine is effectively going to half every 2-4 weeks or so. Depending on how quickly all these pre-orders go online. (1PH/s per 2 weeks at the moment.)
The above is an analysis for a 2TH/s miner going live in December (which is ambitious, even if Cointerrra do say they're shipping in December) Only those that have pre-ordered will possibly achieve this low level of loss
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:00:47
So why does it go up so much and then dip?
If I was receiving my hardware, I wouldn't turn it on and then turn it off after a while.
Miners receiving their hardware accounts for the general upwards trend, but the huge peaks that then disappear must be something else.

To be fair, you did post this before the block...
And this is what pretty much every bitcoin difficulty tracker was showing whilst waiting for the final block.

$0.5 BILLION within those 100 wallets.
No matter where you are, or whatever your currency, the majority of the wealth will end up concentrated in one small area. Not sure how I feel about that
On another note, you would really think that these wallet holders would be a bit more prudent in spreading their wealth.
Obviously the authorities are trying to send a message, but the others don't have an excuse! But the wallets of businesses or personal holders are quite a target. (The smallest wallet there has more than $1million)

As a buyer, I would prefer Paypal and using fiat, simply because of the buyer protection that exists.
This is going to be the single biggest barrier to widespread adoption. Consumers are used to having protection and chargebacks in the merchant fails to deliver. This mechanism does not exist for Bitcoin, and it's going to put a lot of people off as they will, for large purchases at least, fear that they're going to be the victim of fraud.

Not quite sure how countries that still use antiquated measurements (Liberia, USA) would cope with that in terms of mass takeup.
Not a dig, it's just some people in the US may not be used to dealing within milli and as such will refuse to adopt bitcoin if this is forced. (Some old people in the UK still struggle with money since it was decimalised from the old system)
In my opinion, it would be good for bitcoin.

Avoid ASIC mining like the Plague!
The only winner is the hardware maker. 
Those huge 0.5PH/s peaks in hashing that keep appearing on the network are because of the hardware makers are 'testing' their hardware.
They're taking so long to deliver because they can use their machine to mine the fuck out of the network. When they start sending it out, they're already working on their next release to further bend over those with the money willing to pay
