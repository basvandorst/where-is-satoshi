I like big blocks and I can not lie
You other miners can't deny
That when a blocks comes through with an itty bitty fee
And big data in your face
You get fucked, wanna pull your rig
'Cause you notice that power was wasted
Deep in the chain it's pending
I'm hashing and I can't stop bankin'
Oh Gavin, I wanna get with ya
And compile code with ya'
Other miners tried to warn me
But that block size you got makes me so horny
Ohh, Hash-o'-big-blocks
You say you wanna get in my block?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them chattin'
And to the hell with patents'
You're fast, big
Got it goin' like a Josh Garza
I'm tired of solo pools
Sayin that block rewards are a thing
Take the average miner and ask him that
He gotta mine more blocks
So, bitters! (Yeah!) Bitters! (Yeah!)
Have your blocks got the space? (Hell NO!)
Tell em' to increase it! (Increase it!) Increase it! (Increase It!)
Increase that damn block size.
Baby's got blocks.
*EDIT: Thanks for Gold!*

They've lost mine as well. They've stopped 3 separate deposits, and each time I've had to go through the whole 9 yards verification process.
1st Time - DL scan, wait 2 weeks. Approved.
**held again**
2nd Time - "Verification Purposes" -- wait 4 weeks, Approved.
**held again**
3rd Time - DL &amp; bill scan -- waiting on the 4th week now, no reply.
Ridiculous. They tell you "We'll get back to you when resolved" and you never hear from them again.
