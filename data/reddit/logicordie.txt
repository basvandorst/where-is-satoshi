This is a bad comparison I've heard several times. Very many network protocols exist, especially if you don't limit yourself to just the Internet; even TCP/IP isn't exclusive. All the very early protocols no longer exist. Lastly, network protocols are frequently replaced with newer, better, ones. While it may be a good comparison to show layered protocols, it is a poor one to make a point about signal dominant protocols.

@_date: 2018-09-11 15:50:26
I don't think I went more than two sentences the whole write-up without running into something I totally disagree with for technical reasons. There seems to be only one real point, about validation difficulties. The rest was nonsensical anti-altcoin fluff. 
The main point the article makes is that everyone *must* run a full node and extreme measures are needed to ensure that is easily possible. Contradicting this, Satoshi wrote that eventually only miners and large market players would run full nodes. I won't dismiss this wisdom carelessly. He envisioned that most normal users would use SPV to do only the validation relevant to them, instead of every user trying to gate-keep the entire Bitcoin protocol.  This is because the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin is built around the protocol being secured by miners, with hashrate as proof of work.  
Limiting Bitcoin's throughput to make it easier to validate blocks seems an extreme decision. Artificially limiting Bitcoin's throughput has core design side-effects like effecting the long term design of the block reward schedule, changing how transaction fees support mining, and severely limiting the usefulness of the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Sure Bitcoin will hit its natural limitation eventually regardless, thus finding the limit of its on-chain usefulness, and still finding the need for third party solutions. While third party solutions may take us closer to world currency or Visa throughput levels some day, these are some major decisions to be making with that focus this early. One should be careful of shooting their future winning in the foot, due to premature celebration.
If this is the strongest case for small blocks, then it is probably a bad idea.

You don't think this would hurt Bitcoin directly if Bitmain went catastrophic, aside from being FUD ammo? Bitmain's mining pools currently hold around 32% of the BTC hashrate and [just 2 months ago, people complained that Bitmain controlled nearly 51% of Bitcoin's hash.](

Since [Bitmain made $3 to $4 Billion in profits last year,]( they likely have plenty of revenue, despite their interests in an IPO. If they are not hurting for immediate revenue, then lamenting over their long term investments, based on the potential short term losses, is pretty silly.

I don't think the difficulty does anything to benefit mining distribution. I see it more as auto scaling mining rewards regardless of hash rate, but that could have been an intended side effect in the beginning, when everyone was solo mining and pooling mining efforts wasn't really a thing yet.

I think this article just misinterpreted what he said. He was saying ICO tokens will be wiped out, not crypto altcoins. Even the most garbage alts are up 100's of percents from 2 years ago.  If they aren't dead now, they aren't going to die. Garbage ICO's on the other hand...
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:40:46
I disagree. There is a single protocol to attack when only one protocol is dominant. UASF threats proved that decentralized protocol security is currently sketchy, if not totally broken. Digital scarcity is not a novel appeal, it is as simple as issuing a limited amount of tokens. No one crypto-currency will work best for every situation. An ecosystem of crypto-currencies providing a variety of focused services, sometimes working together, and sometimes providing segregated alternative ecosystems is the only realistic future I can foresee. There is great benefit in alternatives. Not everyone wants to use the Google of currency, many will expressly use the DuckDuckGo of currency to avoid it and its big currency problems. That doesn't mean one won't be largely dominant, frequently used as a go-between by other crypto-currencies. Yet, the most dominant crypto-currency is likely to be destined to be the least useful in everyday situations, instead just the work horse for settlement. When there are many crypto-currencies that can be settled with Bitcoin, alt-coins become the sidechains that makes second layer over-complicated and not very useful.

The first of almost anything rarely defeats the test of time. The most popular of anything is almost always co-opted and steered in poor directions seeking to be monetized by middlemen.

@_date: 2018-07-25 18:45:09
Because all ledgers are not created equal. There will be thousands of immutable ledgers. Banks and governments will have their own private ones. My state of Illinois already has their own private one, where they are experimenting with using a blockchain to sign and authenticate state issued documents. Some decentralized cryptocurrencies will be focused on payments, some will be focused on tokens, some on providing a platform for various services, and some on contracts and scripts. Some will be serious business only and some will be for experimental and playful innovation. The whole concept of needing to scale to support all financial transactions is a fallacy for short sighted people with rose colored glasses and superiority control issues. Scaling is simple, have multiple separate coins, with their own networks and ledgers. People get too caught up in cheerleading for a brand or group and forget the real goals.
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:15:44
I'd never expect, or *want*, there only to be only one currency. Decentralization is about having multiple options, that includes in protocol. Bitcoin can't be all things for everyone. Maybe the alternatives aren't quite that great at the moment, in these early stages of cryptocurrency infancy, but the whole concept of 'winning', dominance, and shunning/belittling other cryptos is self-harming fallacy that just makes one look foolish.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:06:09
Some ledgers will be very valuable, some will not. Some will be highly trusted and some will be widely regarded as sketchy scams. People will probably still use the scam ones sometimes too. Just like government currencies and everything else in life. Choice is a wonderful thing.
Bitcoin is not ideal for building everything imaginable on top of. Maybe a higher level altcoin built over the top of Bitcoin could be more useful to built things on top of, but Bitcoin on-chain first-layer isn't very useful to build stuff on. That is okay though, Bitcoin can't be everything for everyone. Let Bitcoin be good at some things and not others, instead of terrible at everything.
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:44:16
You don't always need IP. There are other situations, where addressing devices is as easy as a one byte I2C address. There are situations where addressing devices is done simply by asserting a select pin on a device connected to a SPI bus. There are situations where addressing isn't needed at all and UART is used. Those are just three main ones, but there definitely are many many hundreds comparable to IP and many hundreds of thousands comparable to TCP.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:07:09
UASF was a collusion of a small handful of important centralized economic members, threatening to change the Bitcoin protocol without consensus, by refusing access to relied upon centralized services to those who didn't follow. Blackmail for protocol changes. It exposed a repeatable flaw in Bitcoin's decentralized protocol security and should be a huge warning of how centralized communities can be manipulated to break Bitcoin's decentralization.
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:42:49
First layer Bitcoin has a built-in supply loss, that will seem somewhat like interest. It works by having a limited supply as well as through the block reward schedule, by gradually reducing new coin supply. Also, coins will be irrevocably lost over time reducing the supply and theoretically increasing the value. When you add 2nd layers, you can potentially screw up this careful plan, so all bets are off when you diverge from the original plan.
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:44:10
It is reasonable to have some concerns. The powers that be wouldn't just stop it. Instead, they'd co-opt it then manipulate it into changing into something more controllable, pretending to be a populist movement. They have lots of experience taking over uprisings and running them into the ground.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:33:25
No I did not state that. I was arguing against that this whole time. Why else would I give all these alternatives to TCP?
My main point is that we have TONS of competing base layer protocols for communications and no one protocol ever makes the best base layer. I feel that has proven its self the best strategy and its wisdom should carry over to crypto as well. I feel thinking Bitcoin could ever be the only blockchain and a base for every blockchain application/services is unrealistic, infeasible, and pretty seriously diluted.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:30:25
TCP is not the foundation, it sits on top of other layers. It also isn't ideal for every situation, which is why there are thousands of other protocols. 
Bitcoin is the same. On-chain first-layer Bitcoin has too slow of a block time, too high of fees, and holds too little arbitrary data to build very many things on top of it. Second layer solutions, such as LN, alleviate much of these problems and may facilitate such things being built on it, but LN doesn't have an immutable ledger and is not *actually* Bitcoins, more like virtual tokens backed by Bitcoins or Bitcoin IOU's.

Now you are just moving the bar. I've shown how the Internet is not one single dominant base protocol, TCP, as you said, but instead many thousands of protocols. I've shown how TCP is not ideal in every situation, and shown several very common protocols that do not use TCP at all. SNMP is a generic protocol that many (thousands) of protocols are made from, by just defining meanings for OID's and their fields. You are trying to force a bad point, using a bad example. It has train wrecked, but you keep doubling down. Face it, one Swiss-army-knife protocol is a terrible strategy and will never work for every situation. Instead of being good at anyone one thing, it becomes terrible at everything, by trying to be everything to everyone.

Don't you need space to fit the whole chain initially before pruning it, though?
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:38:13
I disagree. A blockchain is immutable any time it can't be realistically changed. You don't need the most hash for that, far from it. Even then, blockchains can have varying levels of security, they aren't either completely secure or completely insecure. PoW seems like a huge kludge anyways, that will be replaced when a secure alternative is found and proven. We have a long way to go for these future onion layers. More likely applications that want to build over a blockchain will be built on already existing blockchains that are friendlier and more accessible to applications, scripts, and contract, by being able to be used directly, rather than waiting more layers over Bitcoin. Bitcoin's blockchain can't be everything to everyone, which is why there will always be hundred of other ones heavily used for specialty purposes, such as hosting applications and services.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:39:59
I don't dismiss PoW as not being revolutionary, but like the steam engine, I expect something at least slightly better to replace it, like the gas engine. It may still be PoW, but it will be improved from what it is now. I don't think one PoW network (blockchain) to rule them all will ever be a thing.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:13:37
