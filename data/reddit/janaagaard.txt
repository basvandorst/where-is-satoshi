Probably because they can see that BCH is generating a lot of transactions on other exchanges, so they launched support as soon as they were ready.

That sure is a confusing graph. They should have shown how Bitcoin has performed the last 9 years instead.

Is it really that much worth comparing the amount of coins moved with the fee? As I understand it, you pay a fee based on the size of the transaction, and here it is more a question of number of inputs and outputs than the amount of coins transferred. I guess there will often be a relation between the amount and the number of inputs, but they are not directly linked. In others words: You could easily have a transaction worth $1 that would also have a fee of $0.19, no?

How is this possible? It's my understanding that Bitcoin is capable of about 3 transactions per second. Maxing that out, it corresponds to about 95 million transactions per year. Transactions on the Lightning Network should of course be included, but is there really 30 transactions per second on the Lightning Network now?

Ah, yes. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:51:39
Good point.

Why not simply send to the same address each time, and have just one private folded up key?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:15:10
I had 300 BTC. Yes, I know, that's difficult to understand, especially since all security advices are to keep coins in cold storage. I tried transferring some coins to a paper wallet a some time, but there was an error I didn't understand, and I ended up enabling two-factor-authencation instead, and then thinking that this was okay.
I actually tried saving some coins using Bitcoin Builder (BB), but I mixed up the withdrawal addresses. So when I finally thought I had saved some of the coins, and withdrev them from BB they just ended up right back on Mt.Gox. How stupid can you be? Well, just about this stupid, I guess.

Ah, didn't know it had been removed from the App Store. Can't find in any longer in the Danish App Store either, so it's probably a pretty global ban.

The current value for a bitcoin is about 500 US dollars. But the price fluctuates a lot:  I am mostly sad because I still believe that the price a of bitcoin could rise 50.000 US dollars or more if Bitcoins does indeed catch on.

What's wrong with CoinJar?
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:21:18
This guy probably sold instead if holding, though.
@_date: 2019-08-23 19:09:00
You certainly have a very valid point here. I still like the thought of a safe guard, but I have no idea how this could be implemented.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:43:56
How do you do this without paying a massive amount of fees to the exchange? Do you transfer large sums of fiat? Do you keep the coins on the exchange?
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:09:22
Am I the only one here thinking that it's a clever move from BitPay to have some kind of maximum, so that users don't accidentally transfer too much money? Yes, they should of course have some kind of solution so that you can confirm that you do indeed want to sent a big amount, but not without some kind of safe guard.

I'm rooting for Bitcoin Cash, but this is actually pretty funny. =)
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:14:17


Do you have a source for that argument? Never heard it before.
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:43:44
If that number is true, it sounds like they have just added up all the claims, without any filtering whatsoever, meaning that it contains a lot of bogus claims.
"Hey - I heard you can claim that Mt.Gox own you money, and you just have to enter the amount yourself. Let's try to enter a billion USD. We'll be billionaires!"

So you were a store creating Bitcoin inspired arkwork, that did not accept Bitcoin as a payment? Or is the ~5x increase because you started creating and selling Bitcoin inspired arkwork?
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:28:48
I think the exchanges will simply disable withdrawing coins for a while, until they have restored some of their cold wallets. And since they often charge a fee for withdrawing coins, I don't think they will mind at all. :-)

Why not simply link to the post?
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:03:20
Okay. And if I was later to sell the bitcoins on a MtGox or Bitstamp, I would have to transfer them to an account on one of these sites first?
I am just trying to understand the basics of bitcoin security. I should transfer my BTC out from MtGox to a wallet, so that I am protected against my account being hacked?

When I generate a new public/private key pair for a bitcoin address, what happens if I happen to find a pair that is already in use?

Pretty cool, but won't people be annoyed that the animation is looping? I mean, it's nice to animation the QR Code to the some attention to it, but will would personally be seriouly annoyed if the code starting animating all over bofore I got the time to scan it.

There are some good advices on how to handle bitcoins and backups in this new thread.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:06:14
I haven't tried - just read online that the funds were restricted to the local stores. I will certainly try it out then. Thanks a lot for the response. :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:32:24
I would really like to see Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.de.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:00:40
What time zone is this?
Could we make this data shared, e.g. on a wiki page or on a Google Spreadsheet?
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:00:35
Hehe. Thanks. =)
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:42:52
I have bought my bitcoins on Mt.Gox. How should I make a backup?

What exactly is it that Apple is blocking? I am using CoinJar on my iPhone and to me it seems that it does what it should. What am I missing out on?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:02:29
Is it possible to set the transaction fee in CoinJar? I can't find it.
