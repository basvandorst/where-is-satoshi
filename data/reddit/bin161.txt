A Bitcoin Steve Jobs won't be easy to come by though.

While what you are saying is true, it is also a half-truth. Bitcoin might be "regulated by mathematics and cryptography", but the entire **industry around Bitcoin** *does* need to be regulated.
Operating an exchange? Selling mining hardware? Running a BTC store? Web wallet? Money transfer? Gambling business? BTC commodities/futures? Escrow service? 401k/IRA? They ALL need regulation.
So while the act of holding a bitcoin or maintaining a ledger works fine on its own, anything you actually *do* with your bitcoins needs regulation, the same way it does for any other currency. Pretending otherwise is a delusion.

Or how about everyone stop giving him advice and let his lawyer handle it.

Why aren't these merchants giving me discounts to use cash, which has zero fees for them?
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:58:55
By the same logic, why did it bust through the $499 "resistance"?
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:02:29
Yes way! Only hiccup is that rather than pay at checkout, you have to load your account first. But what the heck!
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:44:30
You can be pedantic about it but that doesn't change the basic reason. There is more supply than demand, period.

Do we really need the same article posted from every single news site there is?
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:51:38
This is also a fun exercise in how easy it is to get scammed on the web.

You're just proving my point. If my goal is to preserve wealth, I don't want it to be volatile enough to go -80% or +400% a year from now. Bitcoin is a speculative investment, but NOT a store of value.
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:53:52
But I though fiat was bad because it is tightly controlled by a central authority?

Always knew Circle was full of shit with their "we don't charge fees when you convert funds to or from Bitcoin".

Looks like this Google website links to a lot of illegal torrents. They're going to shut it down next, right?

I'm sorry I didn't get the currency they invested the 1200 in. Could you be more specific?

As long as they properly validate some other ID it's still 2FA.
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:06:07
So how does this work? What are you "trading" exactly? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 08:06:53
Yup, thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:43:16


Do you *really* know this for sure? How much are they paying currently? Can you use Bitcoin for everyday purchases in rural Guatemala? How easy is it to convert from Bitcoin into local Guatemalan currency? What is the cost? Is there any service that hedges against price fluctuation? 
Once you have these answers, it should be easy to either (1) convince them that Bitcoin will help or (2) convince yourself that Bitcoin isn't there yet.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:36:00
But the order was filled. 
Edit: For your second part, yes it's not a marker order, because they want at least $300 per coin. Isn't that a *good* thing?
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:15:39
No one is going to complain if you tip a real amount ($3-$5). It's the $0.021 "tips" that are annoying.

This is pretty huge. You can now use Bitcoin for not only Xbox but *everything* Microsoft sells.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:45:38
More people are selling than buying.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:11:13
Lol, "hey mom, remember the $5,000 you lent me last year? I bought 5 BTC with it. Here they are." Debt repaid!

Yup, just ask Zimbabwe.

Don't convince me lol, convince the rest of the world.

They're doing quicker releases now. One major and 3-4 minor versions *every year*. I'm currently on 2013.4, works perfectly.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:27:18
For your own sake I hope you are a troll rather than actually this delusional.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:41:08
What's the guarantee that they let you go after you pay 2 BTC? (Hint: there is none.) You identify yourself as a willing target and the demands keep increasing.
Call a professional and get it cleaned up for less than the cost of 2 BTC.
Then buy some BTC for yourself just because.
@_date: 2014-10-05 06:11:30
Ok, so you essentially bet that the altcoins you pick will outperform Bitcoin over a predefined period of time?

It's already available on [Bing]( Using Bing would send a better message to Google than a random petition.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:28:44
Can someone help me understand this? All I can see is that someone sold a ton of coins.

Why on earth would anyone be ashamed to be a .NET developer in the first place? It is one of the most widely used platforms in the industry and has been light years ahead of competitors for a  while now. Microsoft has been working closely with the developer community for years and supports projects like Mono, as compared to sue-happy Oracle. It is now moving to open-source all of .NET. And Visual Studio is the best IDE out there by far (and is now free).
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:48:12
If you have to ask that question then it's a scam.

Considering how excited people usually get over $0.000002 tips, 30 cents is a lot of potential karma.
But my point really is that unless there is an independent third party to oversee the transaction or hold the bet, this whole exercise is pointless. No one is going to trust any real amount of money on your reddit reputation.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:32:46
A "store of value" that has lost 70% of what you put in it a year ago?
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:17:03
Not really. I haven't written one in 5 years.
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:42:56
You know why there isn't going to be a bubble? Because EVERYONE is waiting for one so that they can dump their coins (whether they want to admit it or not). Demand is never going to be an order of magnitude higher than supply.

On Bitstamp. Someone put a huge ask at $300. It was partially filled until the price reached sub-$300 (from $325). Now there aren't enough buyers to meet the ask.
I'm not getting the "pure manipulation" part of this.

Considering the fact that the vast majority of Bitcoin mining and trading is happening in China, why are you expecting the price to adjust to the US electricity rate? If a US miner turns off, three more are going to take its place in a cheaper country, which explains why the hash rate has been steadily rising the past year even though Bitcoin price is in decline.
