If you were 3 years in Bitcoin sure you would know by now that price is highly volatile and i bet you would not sell at this price now.

I am in that boat with you. Dont have much but working on getting more. Every bit i gather give me hope one day ppl who laugh at me now will shut up and join us in our nice boat. I think most of us who trust in that tech and gather what we can will be part of new rich elite. Even if not, sure that tought make my miserable living easier lol.

If anyone could double money in few days, he would double his own money.

Fairly new to Bitcoin and i will try this site
@_date: 2015-01-23 11:04:30
Also, profile stats dont work. Bitcointalk will still be my favourite forum but they should fix that asap. With funds and support they have it looks very bad if they cant have better hardware and backup server.
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:56:50
But sure Bitstamp will get more attention with tipping that fallon than if they tipped some random guy lol
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:25:36
Search option on BitcoinTalk does not work, hope that will be fixed.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:22:55
I dont see that mate. Bitcoiners and merchants are losing money so that could hurt adoption and miners stoping to dig so that will hurt network and slow down transactions. Bitcoin is weakening if i did not missed something. Sure i hope decline will stop.

very informative post for anyone new in bitcoin (like my self). thank you mate and keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:52:33
that is my only acc, on bitcointalk i am croato and on twitter also. I am fairly poor bitcoiner was trying to gather some bits, did not know that annoy ppl. Sorry for anoying posts, i am out of here.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:44:50
What you mean suspicious?
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:42:31
Noble cause, i will try to find if Croatian charities take bitcoins, we had great floods lately so if not i will try to make that possible. There is lot of poor ppl in my country and i would like to donate if possible in btc.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:05:38
tarot, cristall ball, cup of coffe, horoscope or...?
@_date: 2015-01-21 07:31:03
Nice, i will try it. If Croatia is included i can map lot of free wifi hot spots. We are small touristic country so this could be great help for tourists to find free wifi.
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:48:26
I dont see problem here at all. Ppl use service that fit them best. There is place in Bitcoin for small and big services. Insulting ppl and yelling like redneck on them will not make lot of ppl drop Coinbase and start using Darkwallet. Chill out a bit bud.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:03:20
In Zagreb, Croatia where i live, i have recently discovered caffe bar where drink can be payed in Bitcoins and there is also Bitcoin ATM so i t is my new coffe place. I am very happy with that and it showes Bitcoin have everyday use even in Croatia where all new things are years late.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:29:49
Idk if that is legal but there are forums which pay share of site revenues to users like  i am sure there are more of sites like that so i guess it is legal. Best you can do is to search bitcointalk forum and ask there in appropriate thread.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:46:43
i am fairly new to all that, reddit and btc so i appologise if for any reason my acc looks suspicious and i want to know why.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:23:16
I agree, tips are great way to show advantages of digital currency to ppl. Fiat and plastic cant match that in their wet dreams lol.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:43:39
with community members like you, bitcoin will become mainstream no sweat. changetip is excelent marketing for us bitcoin enthusiasts.
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:04:16
No. Lost Bitcoin are lost forever.

@_date: 2015-02-06 20:56:10
Wow, thank you mate.

I wonder how much teenagers buying drugs using fiat.

if i know how to make bot and find that piece of bitcoin i would do it but it is nearly imposible to find it just like that
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:27:41

Cool idea
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:31:25
noone can tell price in short or long term. but i believe if bitcoin survive first 10 years it will be worth a bunch. also if bitcoin survive next few thousand years it could be worth shitload of galactic credits.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:32:16
Thx mate
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:31:57
Agreed, maybe when Bitcoin grows then some speed alt with low fee for micro payments and fully annon coin for legal purchases with need of disscretion. I dont think both or some more with fancy features or high tech pos coins could ever (in early stage with Bitcoin under $10k have more than range 0.001 - 0.01 Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:03:14
Goverments dont realy want to bust thieves which steal bitcoins. Bitcoin is possible threat for their colloured, worthles pieces of cotton paper.
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:56:52
If Bitcoin become playground for few dozents of btc elite i bet regular users will find another entertainment.
