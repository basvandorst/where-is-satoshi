Hmm... a curious point. Although I'd argue that Bitcoin has a true inherent value (like gold). It just happened that, overall, it's has emerged as a successful cryptocurrency, and thus has a potential to become a 'reserve' cryptocurrency. 
In order for Bitcoin to have a true inherent value, among other things, it has to go through the test of time: meaning hundreds and thousands of years of being valued by people. 
Having said the above, given its success, Bitcoin is probably the cryptocurrency that everyone should have in their portfolio.

Like you said, Bitcoin is not backed by anything, not only by people's desire to acquire it (people's trust). For this reason it is a high-risk cryptocurrency. And its wild jumps Bitcoin owes to its volatile nature. 
In my opinion, it worth focusing on those cryptocurrencies that are backed by valuable assets. Like gold and silver. 
There are about 40 gold-backed cryptocurrencies on the market now. So a lot to choose from. 
Personally, I'm almost certain that gold-backed KBC has a bright future (it increased by 11 times in one year). Read more on my blog: [

Look, Bitcoin is about to be backed by gold! [
Ultimately, gold backed cryptocurrencies will always be the most valuable in good and bad economy states. Just like gold among the fiat paper money has always been the most valuable in times of economic instabilities.
