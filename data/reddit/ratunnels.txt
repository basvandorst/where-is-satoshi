Well that's only if you payed for the rig in bitcoin.

Don't worry, it was just disparaging one imaginary internet points system for some more imaginary internet points.

I'm sure that there are innovative/intellectual people who graduate college.

If you run your own business, hell, if you work any job, you want a STEADY income. There are monthly bills, food, and little bumps in the road that can only be paid in fiat/"normal money". Also you keep on saying 7000%, has it occurred to you that some people would rather not tie their fate to something that is so risky that it could go up to 7000% just as easily as drop down 7000%?

Wasn't the mantra buy on rumor on here?

Npr usually has fairly unbiased reporting, at least planet money does since I first heard it from there.

thanks for the ego boost, I hope your right and my parents definitely hope your right.

If you have an ar you should definitely have one of these.

They're paid to invest and make gains with minimal risk, that's why numbers might be conservative. Also, 1300 is about a 10% gain right now which is a very large gain when you're working with a lot of money.

Do you listen to planet money?

"the Nigerian prince" WTF man, attack the ideas not the man behind them.

I'm just wondering do you mine? Because it sounds like you're an investor who might have mined in the early days and is trying to tell me what to do. You can't solo mine anymore, hell, even the number of pools are dwindling. Also it seems like you generate wild conspiracy theories on could and mights, if someone really wanted to do a physical attack why not take over a shipment from BFL, they know exactly where they are located unlike the server which is probably hosted among a bunch of other servers with a ton of security.

I'd give it 2 more years, 8-10 years is about the amount of time between economic downturns.

He was hiding money from his ex.

I'm still figuring out if you don't know or your fucking with me. Supply and demand if you don't know, you're a bit of an ass hat if you're trolling.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:12:31
I was addressing the physical attack on the last one, and honestly, if you don't mine and haven't invested in mining you should stfu about caring more about bitcoin because at least I'm supporting it and making transactions go through, all you're doing is complaining from your armchair.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:19:21
Yea that's why I'm going out of mining (At least buying new equipment) and going to mine just for fun and maybe the chance of 25 btc. Right now I have some very profitable machines so I'd like to keep them that way for another 2-3 months.

I'm not going to say I'm smarter than them because my dad is a neurosurgeon and my mom is a government contractor with two masters, they both got their degrees while being dirt poor because they fled Vietnam (because of all the communists and war). I don't doubt their intelligence or work ethic at all and I am most likely not smarter than them, if I were, I'd be a millionaire by now. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:50:42
Ahh my mistake, I read to quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:07:35
No one claims that.

Not saying you're wrong, but do you have an article about this you like in particular?

I was one of those people who shook their head, but I finally gave in at the price of $5 a coin after the first crash. I vowed to sell 10% of my holdings every year on Christmas (minus that year). It's so tempting to sell all right now, but like a lottery ticket, I'm buying rights to have a dream if bitcoin is ever 10k
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:23:55
It sounds like you listen to it because there was a fairly recent episode on bitcoin and tide laundry detergent. It's not an insult and in fact, it was the first place it learned about bitcoin (2010-2011). It's pretty informative, and it provides a wider range of opinions/biases than most programs.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:49:32
link please, and I did run a pool in the gpu days.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:58:39
Sorry, I like to minimize risk after dropping a collective 30k.

I honestly feel a bit guilty because I went against my parents buying them. My parents felt like it was akin to gambling and that I would become some horrible addict if I bought some. I have a very very good life with no need for extra money. I went against them believing they'd be something more some day for really no reason, bitcoin was just another way to get money and the only reason to have money (at least to me) is to be happy; I was already happy, so was going against my parents for a few thousand dollars all that worth it? I don't know, maybe I'm just naive.
