Mmmmmm, I think I'm going for lower risk than that with the cash profits I've realized, but thanks.

I feel a little bad for saying this, but the kind of behavior we're seeing now, which has repeated multiple times since I happened upon bitcoin in early 2011, has changed my life.
It's been extraordinarily easy to profit from it, and the first rule is not to trade emotionally.  Sure, I've felt the psychological pressure, it's been hard.  But it's in those hours/days where I've felt extreme pressure to panic and bail out, that I've done the opposite, and it's completely changed the trajectory of my family's life.
I can say all of this, and people can be aware of the pressures to sell in times like these, and know what they probably should do, but most of the market won't - they aren't mentally tough enough to do it and many people are in waaaay over their heads.  I've been there to take what those people give away, and I'm so much the better off for it.

You can live link to bitcoincharts.com charts, which is apparently what the article author did.  Perhaps he wrote the article a few days ago and just got around to publishing it.
Just goes to show how quickly things change in bitcoin land.  Ha!
Edit:  Oh, now I see that the article was posted a few days ago.  So, yeah, he live linked to the chart he was looking at at the time, not realizing that, well, it would change.  If anything, he probably expected it to go even further down.  Oops.

I'm in the process of trying to secure a loan for a new house within 30 days of a very significant bitcoin liquidation*.  The bank I'm currently working with is actually being very helpful and trying their best to make things work.  Though, the issue as it's been expressed to me is sourcing the money, and there just aren't any guidelines for tracking money from bitcoins.
So, they want to see not just from what exchange the money came (which is easy to demonstrate), but the source of the asset (bitcoin) that was liquidated, where it was held (its "account"), and for how long I held the asset.
Luckily the underwriter has heard of bitcoin and is actually pretty familiar with it.  She's aware that she could verify my claim to have held the bitcoin I sold for over 60 days (I've held them since 2011) by merely looking up the address from which they were sent on the blockchain, but, unfortunately there are no banking guidelines for relying on the blockchain for verification like this.  This is uncharted territory.
Essentially, she's going to try to see if the bank can accept what will amount to something like expert testimony that my claims are true as verification of them.  The avenues I liquidated through all did their KYC/AML diligence and they're being helpful in providing as much documentation as they can, and they can also attest to the fact that the bitcoins I sold were held by me for well over 60 days.  One issue is whether the bank can accept the claim that being able to issue a transaction from a bitcoin address is proof of ownership.  Obviously, most of the relevant people at banks aren't experts on bitcoin, and without any guidelines on this sort of thing, they need somebody they can trust to attest to these claims and how the protocol works.  They can't simply take my word on it.
Worst case scenario is that we simply have to let the money sit in our bank accounts for a couple more statement periods and then this issue just doesn't come up, but our underwriter said she's willing to hang in with us to see if this route can work since she believes that as cryptocurrency popularity increases, banks are eventually going to have to sort all this out anyways.  We should find out how things will go by the end of this week, and I'll make a post about it when we do.
*We're not buying a house outright because with interest rates so low, the money we don't put towards the principal can be invested elsewhere long term and we can probably do better than the mortgage rate with it.

Haha, sweet!  Thanks for the doge!  I'm holding back 30% of what we liquidated for taxes, which is quite a bit more than we owe based on the advice I'm getting.

I've definitely not abandoned crypto.  I just realized an amount of profit that can change my family's life significantly, and I think it was the right move to make.
I'm still heavily invested in bitcoin, certainly more than any traditional financial adviser would be comfortable with, and I'm pretty optimistic about bitcoin's future in terms of its usefulness and what it will be worth in terms of USD value.
It was simply time to improve our life situation and get rid of bad debt.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:22:09
Fair enough.  I wasn't FDIC protecting my balances because I intend to keep them at those levels long term.  I did that as a first step because the amount of money that was sent to my checking account exceeded FDIC limits.

I'm clearly not rich yet, then.

Interesting, I was just looking into getting a custom bitcoin related license in VA.  I'm willing to apply.

I sold a good bit around $800 and am considering taking up a new position around the current price.  We'll see.

A billion USD attempting to enter the market in a relatively short period (a couple months or so) would move the market significantly and probably pretty violently, and probably well over 100%.
Daily worldwide volume is typically under 20 million USD (that's buys and sells).  20 million USD on Bitstamp executed as a market buy would completely wipe out all standing bids and push the price well past 5000 USD.  Nobody would be stupid enough to do that, but it's illustrative of how low the liquidity is versus a billion USD.
It's really difficult to estimate with precision what a billion USD entering would do the price because market depths adjust on the fly and you have to constrain your guess to a time period.  But, a rule of thumb is that the shorter the time period evaluated the more dramatic the effect is likely to be on the market.
We can likely estimate that far, far less than a billion USD came into the market during the move from $100 to $1000.  Granted, resistance is lower through those price ranges, but, again, I think doubling the price from here over a short-ish period is a very, very conservative guess at what a billion USD would do in this market.  My off-the-top-of-my-head guess would be that the price would go over $9000 ;)
Having said all that, it's not likely that a billion USD (of experienced investors' money) will enter the market in so short a time period as to move the market as violently as it's moved in the past.  Though, this is bitcoin, so who knows.
Edit:  I just want to add that I've dealt with SecondMarket and Barry's team and they are top notch and very professional, and I'm super excited and optimistic about their efforts to make bitcoin a more mainstream and institutionally attractive and accessible investment.

Good news, Warren, bitcoins can't be organized into a physical cube.  Buy!

My mom called me last night to tell me she had spoken to her financial advisor about bitcoin and was warned to avoid it.  Then she added, "and did you hear, bitcoin went under today".
She's older and, honestly and unfortunately, it's just not worth my time at this point.  "Hmmm, Ok mom, I'll look into that (with as much effort as you cared to).  Talk to you later".

I came on board in early 2011.  As a relatively early adopter, and having held through quite a few really volatile periods, I feel like I could ride that roller coaster while chugging a gallon of milk, and then afterward get off and go for a jog.

Thanks.  I've been poking around the Vanguard site.  Thanks for pointing them out.  Definitely something I need to learn more about.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:46:48
Oh, I agree with you.  Perhaps I framed the story poorly, but my point was about what she "heard" had happened to bitcoin; namely, that it had "gone under".  Her advisor told her that it had "gone under" and was "done".
I spoke to her today and explained that no, bitcoin hadn't "gone under", but that, yes, the advisor was right to warn against it because it's too high risk for her age with any significant amount of her savings.

I guess my concern with silver and gold is that I'd be taking from the pool I just liquidated and putting it back into something relatively high risk and volatile.  Admittedly not nearly as risky and volatile as bitcoin, but still pretty high up on that scale, I think.  I need to think about it some more and do some more research.  Perhaps I'll liquidate some more bitcoin into silver and/or gold.

We're in the process of upgrading to a larger house and are in need to quite a lot of new furniture.  I told my wife to check out overstock.com because we could spend some of our bitcoin there.
She just texted me that she's pretty excited by what she sees, so overstock could be getting $15k+ worth of bitcoin business from us.  So, yeah...
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:32:21
Yeah, I've set aside a few to give to her in a few years.  She's worried about retirement, and I think 10 bitcoins in 5 to 10 years could be pretty significant for her.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:56:34
I don't even know what that means.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:19:56
That's actually something I've given some thought to, and I plan to look into it more seriously going forward.
