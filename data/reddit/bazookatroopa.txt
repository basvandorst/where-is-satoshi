Gdax is Coinbase. Coinbase isn't a scam people are just salty about how they integrated BCH, plus there's a big push for Gemini here. If you go on Twitter there is a big push for bitstamp. Coinbase is still the biggest and best right now. They also insure your bitcoin from any hacks that are their fault and your USD is federally insured.

They are infiltrating this subreddit hard right now lol 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:30
Have to know when it's a good time to buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:11
Not a true HODLer unless you hodl through a crash. Last two months have been all bull market, let's see you shine 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:57
Yes. The difficulty in adding more bitcoin gets exponentially harder 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:03:30
Only GDAX matters unless you want to arbitrage 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:53:41
We were in the bear trap phase lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:04:57
Every 1k it drops I put in money to match what I lost 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:52
Which is why I am 50% bitcoin, 50% alts. I believe one of these cryptos will be a successful world currency. I am aware of the limits on bitcoin, but am still hopeful that the transaction fees will be resolved. The other issues you mentioned such as in fighting will happen with any crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:40:09
Coinbase or GDAX are good for buying. If you don't want to trust them, move to a hardware wallet. People unfairly blame Coinbase for the last dip, but it was all the BCH founders fault and the GOP tax bill. We back though. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:13:16
I think he meant on Coinbase which is still over 14k
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:36
They can't lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:50:04
The dip could have just as easily been a bear trap lmao. Zoom into the bear trap and it matches the current chart. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:35:28
Any bank app is like that wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:04:04
They are waiting for bitcoin to become stable, it's too difficult to deal with a currency that is not stable. Bitcoin is more of a commodity like a digital gold right now, but if it ever stabilizes will be more useful as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:22:09
Yeah those too, but they are still a problem for using bitcoin as a currency. Transaction fees can be fixed. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:17:09
Or they know they that they can use their money and influence to manipulate the currency, then use the new futures to profit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:32:05
25k or 5k
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:44:09
Just put like 5% back in bitcoin JIC during the next dip
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:12
In 2013 mtgox, the biggest exchange with about 70% of bitcoin in circulation, was hacked. Btc crashed from $1163 to $387. That's almost a 70% crash. No wonder it took 3 years after such a major hack. This crash is only 35%, that's something even regular stocks do. It was also $4k and crashed down to $1.7k a little under a year ago when China banned bitcoin. Stop spreading bullshit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:06:10
*thousandth 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:31:45
I agree 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:45
Bitcoin is 9 years old and has been through worst dips. There are many dedicated holders it wouldn't go all the way down. This is bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:16:26
It sucks we are losing net neutrality, but the effect of losing it is being over dramatized. There will probably be a dip and then it will go right back up like how the Brexit vote affected global markets 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:13:42
Tomorrow it's going to shoot up or crash based on how the futures end up 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:46
Hopefully $1 so I can buy 1000s
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:24
Proud of you mate let's do it together. Even though this already gone back 10%
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:41:58
If this isn't a meme.. Go get your stomach pumped. That's not going to kill you just ruin your liver and cause problems down the road when your mind clears out. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, it's supposed to be the future of transactions and a hedge fund against FIAT. Please calm yourself down these dips are completely normal for bitcoin. What you need to do is just wait a few weeks and watch it bounce back. Don't panic sell then regret this from your hospital bed in a few weeks. Take care bro please don't be stupid, I care about you and don't even know you imagine the people in your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:47
That tax law will only help bitcoin. People will stop trading it for shitcoins to avoid the tax. This correction will reduce weak hands. This buys us time to implement lightning network and segwit to reduce fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:15:11
If you are in the US use Coinbase /GDAX to buy 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:12:28
Just giving a hypothetical. I'm curious to see how the futures end up in the opening tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:01:19
Truth is they didn't do shit other than not announce the release early. They are the biggest exchange any move they  make will affect prices. They were against BCH at first and only did this after the community wanted their free BCH fork money. BCH is one of the biggest cryptos and from their value deserve to be on there, even if their founder is a dick. He probably gave out insider information, but I don't think Coinbase is at fault here. Fuck BCH though and all the people brigading this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:14:21
Maybe it'll jump up again after tomorrow... Or crash.. Who knows.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:32:33
Lol wow you weren't kidding. I agree constant forking is frustrating, but Bitcoin has beaten every fork so far though. I wouldn't count Bitcoin out entirely yet. Crypto is the future though regardless. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:55:53
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:02:00
Exactly, these big traders have the money to spend to manipulate Bitcoin. They can spend a few billion and use their influence to control the price. Bitcoin is worth over 200 billion. If they can turn 1 billion into 5 billion in a couple months, why the fuck not. That's significant money 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:28:10
This isn't miniscule. Remember when millions were dumped at a time when bitcoin was around $3k? They would have over 5x the money in just a few months. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:08:01
China desires to ban bitcoin also though... 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:53:03
It will drop again 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:11:51
It dripped to $1700 just a few months ago lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:53:03
It will drop again 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:02:04
Just don't panic and stick through.. Patience is always the best strategy. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:12:32
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:52:13
Inb4 quantum computing breaks bitcoin in 10 years.. Jk lol 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:55:28
I sold :(
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:59:56
Recessions have happened in the past on average every ten years or so, bull market doesn't stay forever. Although a recession would probably help deflate cryptos as FIAT currencies inflate  
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:00:23
I remember back when they were $200 after the first major spike and people were telling me to sell because of an "inevitable" crash so I did... Huge mistake. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:50:40
I bought in middle of the dip at 2600 I wish I bought at 2400, but it's stupid to try to time btc. I'm sure it's going to continue bouncing back and forth as it keeps rising 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:57:15
You are too late. Only way you would make money mining today is with a botnet of IoT devices...  Or investing in modern ASICs, but they become outdated within months.. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:52:32
That would impact any investment to some degree lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:51:29
Keeps the value high. If some of those people ever gained access to their btc it can cause some market crashes
