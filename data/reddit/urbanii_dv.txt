Sorry for your loss.

You might as well gamble 200K at a casino, better odds and you'll have more fun doing it.

At least they have tangible assets, you can't even say that of a crypto.


Compare the amount of money in their bank accounts with the amount in their digital wallets and you will know who they trust more.
If the market collapse you liquidate your risky investments to buy gold, bonds and blue chips.

The thing you just linked states BTC is overvalued by 3-4 times its marketcap and has a negative outlook for the next year.

Miners are worthless and they are not collateral if BTC goes belly up. 
The trend has been negative since the end of 2017, money is going back to traditional assets. 
Crypto won't disapear but the current crop will.

The very idea is repulsive.

People will flock into gold and out of speculative assets...

We jumped from Digg 4 to Reddit in one day...

I guess time will tell. Amazon has tangible value though.

Wait what? I never compared crypto currencies to the stock market, perhaps you could compare them to pink slips.
