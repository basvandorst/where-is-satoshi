You're basically saying that whales aren't traders, which is is most cases certainly false. Whales buy/sell as much as anyone, often times with leverage. The price is falling for a multitude of reasons, the CME futures is not a plausible explanation at all.

That's really untrue. Firstly, TA encompasses a wide range of technical indicators and tools, some more useful than others, especially as they pertain to certain assets. BBands, certain candle formations and MACD tracking certainly seems to have legitimacy when tracking bitcoin. Anyone who thinks otherwise, really hasn't done their own research.

If BCH wasn't a joke than why is it *barely* managing to hold onto 1/5th the value of BTC? I would think the flippening would happen faster with a bit more momentum if it were going to happen.

Actually I never said anything about predicting? You're strawmanning me here and calling me stupid at the same time..
Market cap means what it means. Theoretical circulating supply x last transacted price. 
I never said anything about trading or predicting markets. That was all you, man. Market cap, volume, order book depth - they are all real numbers. For you to claim market cap is meaningless is really dumb of you but go on and continue to fight a strawman! You're really winning!
By the way volume doesn't mean anything without price and recent price action (i.e. looking at candles) so again.. your claim that volume helps you predict [something] is really nonsensical.

@_date: 2018-01-14 22:59:37


Once again, it is you who doesn't know what you're talking about. Volume is the total value of transactions across a certain time frame. It's certainly not only viewed on the daily and it is definitely not the total number of transactions, that wouldn't tell you any useful information, especially if the numbers were inflated by extremely small transactions. 
I'm surprised you think you know what you're talking about here because you are making a fool of yourself. 
In addition to everything I wrote above, this had nothing to do with my contention that liquidity is different from volume. They are two different things. End of story. Live in denial of that if you want but you will continue to make a fool of yourself if you try to talk coherently about markets if you don't understand the difference between these two numbers.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:11:22
Scientific basis? No, I don't think anyone said that TA was scientific. The indicators are based on trading data and usually correlate to another indicator or metric such as volatility or volume. The changes in these values can give you information about the current state of the market that you can't gather from just looking at the order book and trade history. Additionally, certain candle patterns on higher time scales suggest certain market sentiments that are not readily available by just looking a line graph of the price or watching the trade history. For instance, a hammer on the 4hr chart is a pretty reliable sign of a bullish reversal (small box on the top with a long shadow underneath -
meaning the open and close prices were relatively high and the volatility reached to a much lower level). This info is available in a higher resolution on the 1m chart but it's not as readily apparent to the eye if you don't know where to look.
It's simply untrue that *none* of these indicators are useful for predicting movements of the markets across certain time frames. Again, something like BBands tightening in conjunction with volume dropoff is just an extremely reliable indicator that the price is about to break in one direction. Knowing just this much can improve a trader's outcomes significantly.  
edit: I would agree that there are self fulfilling aspects to it, as well. Things like resistance levels.

No, benefiting from insider info to the detriment of others is wrong. See the Coinbase BCH shenanigans. While this isn't technically insider trading, at least as it pertains to US laws, it's clearly unethical profiteering. Insiders bought BCH at the beginning of the pump, knowing that the news of the pairings would increase the price, then the insiders sold into the FOMO and bagholders lost out. How is that ethical?
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:40:11
Seriously, even your description defines two different things and yet you're claiming they're the same?? 
Liquidity is current order book depth (total value of orders on the books). Volume is a measure of cumulative orders across a time period (i.e. the flux of market orders across the book over a given period of time). Liquidity is a dynamic (and theoretical) measure of market depth in the present moment. Volume is a historical indicator or price action across the order book. Do you *honestly* not see how those two things are different? One integrates across a time frame and the other is instantaneous. These are two separate things. It worries me if you still don't understand this.


This is fundamentally unsound reasoning. I'll let you figure out why.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:59:51
Don't sink to their level. Let BTC stand on its merits, not news hype.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:28:39
You've got to be joking, right? As I just explained, the market cap is indicative of the price sentiment and circulating supply. You wouldn't refer to the price to compare the *current* market value of each, you would compare their market caps.
Alt price is $30,000. BTC price is $15,000. One might conclude that alt is valued more than BTC. In reality, alt only has 1 million circulating coins and its marketcap is actually roughly 1000% smaller than Bitcoin's market cap.
I'm sorry, but you are completely deluded if you believe this narrative that market cap does not have meaning. This number reflects the product of two metrics (price and supply) and provides a reflection of price sentiment in the market. There is simply no way you can deny that this number is far more important that the price of the coin.
In the end, the denominations are completely arbitrary. You're not actually buying 1 BTC or 100,000 satoshis or whatever decimal point people use. You're buying 1/21,000,000 of the total supply of BTC or 1/xx,xxx,xxx of the circulating supply. Market caps gives you information on both. End of story.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:32:06
They don't have nearly the same risk profiles. If BTC doesn't succeed, alts won't succeed. If BTC does succeed, alts won't succeed. BTC has enormous upside with a possible significant downside. The odds of BTC failing to gain traction are far lower than that of the alts, and it's essentially 100% certain that *most* alts will not maintain any substantial monetary value and will continue to have basically no inherent value.

That's obviously not true. I imagine you've only lived in places with decent internet access. 
Anyway, we're not talking about 1mb, we're talking about increasing blocksize to scale with user. This math does not work out once you start ramping up. Additionally, it just increases more and more spam to fill up the blocks. It kicks the rock down the road and eventually you end up with way bigger (literally) problems.

Yeah I'm not arguing that. All cryptocurrencies are backed only by their blockchains and mining network and, more fundamentally, by the belief people have in the value of these things. Beyond that, there are not additional assets that underpin the value of these coins. If, at this moment, nobody is willing to pay more than $1 and a seller agrees to that price, than that's the current "last" valuation of the coin. The market cap would also reflect this.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:32:34
Lightning network is a layer 2 protocol that works on top of Bitcoin. Its value is underpinned by the Bitcoin network.
Alts are clones that work outside of the BTC infrastructure. Pretty big difference there. Endless ICOs and people alternating between coins based on current fees is not a sustainable model. Alts are a bubble, only a handful of projects will have staying power and be worth anything in a few years. BCash offers nothing substantial and will die off in due time.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:28:16
You are completely misinformed on this, my friend. I'll try to explain it to you once more, the price doesn't tell you anything about supply, liquidity, or anything of the sort. Let's say, for instance, that you were trading MoronCoin (MRC). The last traded price of MRC is $5. You assume you can sell it for that price, so you login to the exchange and post a limit sell for $5. Your order never gets filled? Why? Well it turns out there is only 1 MRC in the supply and the last price was you purchasing it from John McAfee. Because you didn't account for circulating supply (and volume/liquidity), you didn't realize that the market depth / order book was not going to enable you to sell for the 'last' price. If you flip the example around and consider purchasing 5 MRC, once again, if you don't take into account the marketcap and liquidity, you're going to be out of luck when you go to make your order.
If you really think price is the only salient metric, I'm sorry but you really have no idea how markets work and you need to take a course on the subject.

I personally know people who don't have access to internet fast enough to run a node from their residence. This becomes more and more of a problem with larger blocks.
Bitcoin (and every other alt) is not ready for mainstream adoption. The tools need to be built before micro-transactions are feasible. Increasing the blocksize leads to more problems down the road and provides no real benefit, except cheapening fees in the short term. Nobody even transacts crpyto in this way so it's not a current use case that needs to be supported. BCH is a joke and LN is digging a nice grave for it right now.

Are you a moron too? Do you think price is meaningless? Obviously not because transacting BTC is *all about* the price and price is an indication of perceived value. Market cap is just the price across the supply. It doesn't mean that each coin could be sold or bought for that total, because price discovery is a dynamic process, but again this is the same thing with quoting the *last* ticker price.

What do you mean every single investment went down? Are you in alts? That's mistake number one. There are legitimate coins and scam coins. Scam coins are always a gamble.

This is stupid. The "cake incident" was discrimination, which is illegal for good reason. Imagine living in a world where you are turned away from business after business merely for the reason that you're gay or black or Jewish. Sure, you could always find a business willing to accept you as a customer but depending on the scenario that could be very difficult or even impossible. LGBT is specifically designated as a class protected against discrimination. The reason they are protected is because bigotry against them has historically been rampant. Personally, I don't want to live in a society where certain groups of individuals are considered second class citizens. It is necessary, in many cases, for the federal government to ensure that its citizens are protected against this type of discrimination. Look no further than Little Rock Nine for the perfect example of an infringement of rights and the federal gov't stepping in to protect its citizens.


So, so stupid. It was *a* government that did this. Governments change with time and vary based on location and demographics. You're painting a scary picture of government in principle by cherry picking a few examples. I could share some scary stories about the "free market" or "anarchist societies" and attempt to paint with a broad brush, but that would be disingenuous.

I don't really see how that applies here. The buy and sell side liquidity pools are dynamic. If support collapses in a really obvious way (say, for instance, a hard break below $5800), this is a signal to the majority of traders following traditional analysis to short or sell. 
Where do the contrarians come into play here? Yeah, you could see a whale or group make a move counter to the obvious, but there's no reason to think that that will necessarily increase demand enough to stave off the sell side. 
Not really sure how your conclusion follows. Seems like a non-sequitur. 
However, I do think that a majority of people (read: noobs) get used for liquidity by smart traders / whales to sell or buy into, particularly in very illiquid markets like Bitcoin and even more so with alts. In this way, the self fulfilling prophecy could work in the contrarian direction, but it's still a self fulfilling prophecy nonetheless.

It's undeniable in my view that certain technical patterns and indicators have merit and relate to making better trades. The tricky part is how you apply it. A lot of people are way too narrowly focused on one or two indicators or one or two time frames. I can't see how *that* is effective, but things like horizontal resistance/support, volume profiles, BBands, triangles and so forth can certainly be useful for trying to decide a moment to buy or sell.
You have to constantly be re-evaluating though. If something doesn't go according to plan then you re-assess and readjust your trades accordingly. People who think that TA can predict the exact price movements across long time frames are fooling themselves, I think. 
It's also unclear to me how much validity is due to self fulfilling prophecies. Me thinks probably quite a bit. Nonetheless, much like a placebo, if it works, it work.

This could be largely due to US holidays though.

Again you are referring to *government* as if it were some sort of unchanging monolith that can do no good. I'm not going to get into some big discussion about government philosophy because these conversations usually don't resolve to anything positive but your argument rests on cherry picking the worst things governments have done and making hasty generalizations about government as a *concept*. Given your success and stature with the Bitcoin community, I have to view this is disingenuous and not simply an error of reasoning. I believe you already know the errors your making when painting with a broad brush on this subject. I find it disheartening that the Libertarian / AnCap group can't really defend their ideologies with consistent principles, only cherry picked stories about Alan Turing or the Tuskegee study. Yes, various governments have committed atrocities because bad actors have a successful track record of co-opting the government for malicious purposes. It's an illogical leap to begin to make generalizations about "the government" based on these incidents.

It's a piece of software code, the *intent* that it has is applied by the people who use it. 


Voted to the top where? In this sub? Molyneux is a white supremacist and an unhinged lunatic. Falkvinge is a blowhard nobody who tries to talk tech even though he's not a developer and has no idea what he's talking about. He's just selling himself as a brand.


I never said Satoshi didn't have a vision. I said that Bitcoin doesn't have "intent" and that BCH is not "Satoshi's vision" (and that this is a wholly unverifiable statement anyway).


Trust me, I pay attention. I pay attention the fraudulent claims that are rampant in the BCH community. All sorts of made up propaganda to pump the price and shit on Bitcoin. 
Anyhow your point on mining is completely wrong. Do you realize that you offered absolutely no evidence for the statement: 


You're a [ Mining profitability is virtually the same between both projects and has been for quite some time.

Picking longer time frame is not *arbitrary*, it's accounting for volatility. In order to frame it as sinking, you have to put on some special glasses that ignored a vast majority of the data. BTC has dipped like this before several times, and then it went back up to make new ATHs. I don't see how this is any different.
The market moves in cycles. Being arbitrary is picking the top and measuring from there.

Again, now you're moving the goalposts. I never said anything about size. I said that the constitution set up the framework for a national (Federal) gov't. 


What don't I understand? Vote new people in, bro. This is a democratic republic. Don't like it? Vote.


What does this have to do with anything? Hold your reps accountable and vote the change into office. Simple as that.


What does this have to do with the Federal gov't as an entity itself?


Jesus Christ. How many red herrings can you throw at one comment? Who cares. What does this have to do with the underlying question?


Again, what does this have to do with the existence or lack of existence of the federal gov't or its various aspects? You're not making a compelling argument here because you keep going off on all these tangent examples of things the fed has done wrong (in your eyes). I'm talking about **fundamentally**, why is the federal government bad/wrong/unconstitutional *in theory*.

It does though because it's indicative of consensus. Furthermore, BCH has now lost its shot because 'Bitcoin' is a chain of contiguous blocks. The name referring to BTC now and BCH later makes absolutely no sense, even if BCH did overtake BTC in terms of hashing power and chain length. It's sort of a one shot deal. The network didn't follow the fork, so *that* is the contentious fork and therefore an alt.

No, those are *your* goals and they're not shared by everyone in crypto. Bitcoin is a piece of technology, not a political ideology.
You can't regulate Bitcoin. You can't ban Bitcoin. Bitcoin is borderless and it's about as an-cap as it gets.

Lol, you idiot, the Constitution *is* the Federal gov't. Duh. I'm not talking about what you think about the federal government's actions, I'm asking *in theory* what's different between taxes at the federal vs state level.


Again, this is just baseless conjecture. There's plenty the federal government does besides "wasteful spending". I can tell you that I grew up right down the street from Shay's Rebellion. 


If you don't support that, then vote new congesspeople in to change the laws. Plain and simple. Also, are you saying every military conflict is unjustified? We shouldn't have fought WW2? The Civil War?


How do you know that? I'm not defending unnecessary conflict but you're making an incredibly over-simplified argument that just reads like more &gt; The Iraq and Afghanistan wars will cost taxpayers at least 6 trillion dollars over time. 
Yep, these were expensive and misguided wars, particularly the Iraq war, which was a complete disaster. **Why does that make the Federal gov't bad in theory?** Your examples only show what bad leadership can do, not why the Fed is itself bad.


Actually the US is at a strong advantage by leading on the national stage. Unfortunately Trump's isolationist policies and idiocy have ceded a lot o America's power to Germany and China. 
Again, your arguments are so basic and misguided. You're missing all the counterclaims that could be made against what you're saying but you're so set in your ways that "The Big Bad Fed" is the enemy that there's little hope you can open your mind up to new information and ways of thinking.

1. There's scant evidence Jack is ill-intentioned or a bad person. People here (I guess) are largely conservative and hate Twitter's ToS, but that's a whole different argument. Twitter is dealing with an unprecedented communication network and is putting forth relatively lax rules in place to prevent things like harassment, coordination, Sybil attacks, etc.
2. The game theory of Bitcoin is designed to reach equilibrium in terms of price speculation. Anyone who is financially vested has two options, hold or sell. If a group attempts to degrade Bitcoin (or BCH, for a real world example), the price will go down and they will need to sell or lose money. This means that it's not profitable or sustainable to attack the coin in this way. You're ultimately only taking losses and hurting yourself by doing this. Conversely, it pays to improve Bitcoin, because improved perception means the value will increase.

You cannot select specific instances and claim a trend. You either need to look at the entire data set or a random sampling of sufficient size. 
Nonetheless, you're completely oblivious to the fact that it wouldn't be reasonable to expect balance in this scenario anyway, given that one side of the political spectrum is more likely to violate the ToS. 
And, further, are you saying that Twitter shouldn't be able to decide how to run their business? Are you saying that corporations shouldn't be able to decide their ToS?
You are seriously the epitome of uninformed Libertarian ideologue. You haven't even thought most of this through. You're just lashing out at Twitter because Tim Pool and your fellow conservatards told you to.

Holy shit, you are absolutely retarded. 
No, you cannot because 1. anecdotes 2. Selection bias 3. missing data and 4. balance fallacy


Yes, that's true. Conservatives are likely more apt to rage out and harass users on Twitter. Hence me bringing up the balance fallacy numerous times.


The rule is that you cannot repeatedly harass someone with misgendering. Yes.


Dude, all you're doing is just repeating Tim Pool's talking points.


This is not something that prevents conservative discussion. It's something that protects the harassment of users, which Jack and Vijaya detailed several times (but still somehow went of Pool's head and apparently yours too). There's nothing in the ToS preventing people from disputing transgender norms, you're just not allowed to harass transgender people by repeatedly misgendering them. How is this a problem for conservatives? Either 1. don't use pronouns when speaking with transgender people or 2. don't interact with transgender people. It's as simple as that, dummy. 


Uh, HURR DURR. I *did* listen. To both podcasts, actually.
Here's the bottom line. Twitters goals are to create a platform that maximizes productive discussion for the most number of users. Harassment discourages good faith users from conversing and therefore the ToS is aimed at preventing this discouragement of discussion.
Get it yet, buddy? Or is this still going over your head?

@_date: 2018-06-06 00:23:06
That's not the killer app for Bitcoin. The killer app is decentralized, durable hard money. Instant/feeless payment protocols can be built on top but their value add it limited, especially when technology has reduced friction between assets and payment processors to a high degree. Payment processing coins have to compete with centralized solutions and other cryptos that are focused solely on payment (BCash, for example). These payment networks will converge around a equilibrium where the value of the networks are equal to the fair market value of the tokens. Because they're competitive and non rent-seeking, the potential valuations are much lower than what we're currently seeing in the market for alts.
Bitcoin will likely be the only remaining high-value PoW, store of value coin because the network is strongest when it's unified on one chain. There aren't good reasons to have multiple cryptos competing to fulfill the hard money use case.

Proof of stake doesn't even work so far as we know. It causes numerous economic problems and its security is obviously more vulnerable and its attack surface greater. PoW is security. It takes work to break work. 
Perhaps you don't really understand the function of proof of work as it relates to securing the blockchain? It's pretty much the foundation for how Bitcoin works and stays decentralized. It's all about accumulating work and mining blocks. The fact that it's tied to actual resources is the entire reason it works.

How is Bitcoin "heavily centralized"?


lol, wut?


This is idiotic. Bitcoin's branding is tied to a specific chain. Twitter is not the one to decide and enforce this, courts are. But Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are poorly defined by regulatory bodies and that's unlike to change anytime soon.


No shit. 


You think Bitcoin going from $0 to $50,000,000,000+ in a **10 year time frame** is "the market is lukewarm".
You are a silly, silly person. 


How many times do you need to repeat the same thing over and over?
Th point is that you can *predict* which project is most likely to be successful. 
... this is not hard to predict at this point. 
You keep babbling about how bad utility is but I don't think you really understand what Bitcoin is solving for.

@_date: 2018-03-23 09:45:31


Electricity is likely to become cheaper and more distributed itself in the near future due to changes in energy sources. 
"Centralizing mining to a point" is a bit irrelevant. The only real threat is a 51% attack and even that is more-or-less not really an issue with a network this size. Any 51% attack would be quickly accounted and corrected for that a damaging effect would be untenable. The attack would be so unprofitable to begin with that the economics simply don't make sense for a party to do so. Remember, this is only talking about 1 block, as well. In order to mine backwards *and* mine forwards faster than the rest of the network, you need much greater than 51% (though, to be fair, 51% attacks are possible with somewhat less hashrate). 


This is not the issue. Yes, mining is essentially global electricity arbitrage and is not evenly distributed geographically or between parties. That is not the same thing as saying that Bitcoin is centralized. The nature of PoW ensures that so long as **one party** doesn't control a majority or near-majority of the hashing power that the protocol remains consensus-based.
Again, I can't stress enough that BCH is not a viable long term solution for the use cases that BTC primarily solves for. It's a big, clunky centralized database and nothing more once the blocks get big enough. Not trying to shill or FUD, I'm just making the point that there is a *hierarchy* of technicals and use cases and the foundation for the entire project *is* its decentralization. Without that there's nothing groundbreaking. Bitcoin Cash's sole distinction is Big Blocks. This is untenable. Not just due to storage but also network propagation. It's also just a really stupid way to go about scaling. There's no reason to include coffee shop transactions on a distributed blockchain. LN or something similar is the only sensible way to scale to that level of payment and beyond (true micropayments). If you create a massive blockchain, then virtually all miners and nodes are excluded and the war is already lost. If you keep the blockchain lean and abstract additional layers that are pegged to PoW on the blockchain, then you have a solution to *means of exchange* that retains its dependency on *store of value* and *unit of account*.

I never said anything about "typical," you're just continuing to strawman me. I'm saying that there are a reason why many traders and hodlers denominate their wealth in BTC. At least *some portion of the market* believes that the intrinsic value is vastly greater than the current extrinsic value. You're arguing a point you can't win. You've already admitted that there's intrinsic value in the tech but you're somehow claiming that *nobody* identifies this when investing, which is provably wrong. 
You said:


Again, even if it were just Peter Thiel and myself investing for the intrinsic value, this discredits what you're saying. Obviously, there are many more (look at back in 2012 or 2013) who have the same idealistic view of blockchain use cases, so it extends to those people as well. I don't know why this type of conversation gets you off, you are clearly wrong and instead of just qualifying your statement or just admitting that you were mistaken, you seem adamant about claiming something that I've already *proven* is not true. One more time, just so you get it through that thick head of yours, even if just *one person* is investing for its intrinsic value, it demonstrates that your hypothesis is wrong. Clearly there are more than a handful of people who identify as Bitcoin maximalists and would say the same thing. 
Grow up.

That doesn't make any sense. There are *baseless* predictions and then there are predictions that are based on data and reasoning. Nobody is saying that 'predictions' are in and of themselves are a fool's errand. It's all about how you arrive at your conclusions and this guy's methodology is beyond retarded. 
I have yet to see any sort of rigorous statistical analysis of the validity of his predictions versus others. All I hear is people referencing a handful of things he got "right" (again, the extent to which some of these predictions were profound is up for debate).
What is the UFO thing your talking about? I tried googling but didn't find much.
How many things has Clif gotten plainly wrong? He said the world was going to fall apart in 2012 (dollar failing, markets crashing, etc.), has made price predictions that have been grossly inaccurate (and then he explains it away with "the timing isn't always right") and predicted that Trump would win in a landslide (he didn't and the chances of him winning weren't that small according to *actual* statisticians).
What your buying into here is clearly snake oil but I'd be happy to be *proven* wrong. So far all you've done is provide a few vague anecdotes about predictions that he supposedly made with precision, though I even doubt this. Still, where is profound work? Where is the prediction that actually makes a compelling case for why is methods provide *any* sort of value? So far I'm just seeing a bunch of obvious shit with wide ranges of error. Plus, a broken clock is right twice a day.

No offense (really) but you are sounding crazy. This is the piece of evidence that supports your conclusion that Clif is providing useful analysis? That he predicted something that happens several times per year happened a few months after his report came out? You gotta be kidding me. This is not comparable at all to predicting a 20 foot baby from space landing on the lawn of the white house and then *that* happening a few months later.

He even claims to be a neuroscientist and an evolutionary biologist. This is absurd behavior, especially from a so-called academic. 
Watch Peterson hunch his shoulders forward throughout this whole debate, while Matt Dillahunty teaches Peterson rudimentary Logic. Peterson cowers to anyone that employs critical thought effectively.

It's speculative, you fucking moron. There are a lot of investors who can't even explain what a blockchain is. Real investors (Peter Thiel, Winklevii, Novogratz, etc.) aren't investing because of the media hype, they're investing because it's a worthwhile project and most big names have voiced a lot of speculation at the supposed value of alts. Bitcoin is fundamentally different from these pump and dump schemes for reasons already described. That's why the senate banking hearing yesterday described the two as very different. Bitcoin's *intrinsic* value has nothing to do with media attention. The value, once again, is the network itself. Who gives a shit what the price is? I'm talking about the *intrinsic* value, not extrinsic. The real issue is that idiots like you have jumped on the 'crypto' bandwaggon in 2017 and most of you don't know the first fucking thing about the technology and have equated all crypto as equally valuable in theory, when in reality nothing could be further from the truth. 
Go read a fucking book.

I literally just went over this. Did you read what I wrote? Nothing ties it to the "name" but people use the "name" to refer to the *chain*, if the chain is broken and gapped, then there's not *reason* to start calling that chain by another chains name. People can use words however they want, that's how language develops but there is fundamentally no good reason to start calling *that* chain Bitcoin. It's highly irrational. 


Because people reference the chain by name. They don't sit there and start rambling off HEX or what have you to describe the thing they're talking about. They simply say Bitcoin, when they mean the chain and network that is referred to by Bitcoin by other people.




Why? That would only confuse people more (Bitcoin Cash is already confusing enough). ONE MORE FUCKING TIME, the names are references to the chains and supporting network. Why don't we start calling oranges, apples?

It's not though. Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralized, consensus-based, immutable ledger system. It is fully operational and has the most hashing power, largest dev group and is the most tested. ICOs are mostly scams and even the ones that aren't don't really have inherent value, especially when compared to Bitcoin. Nearly everything blockchain related can be accomplished on BTC or through additional layers. There's not intrinsic value in redundant, duplicated tech that's fundamentally weaker in the areas listed above.

Another moronic statement. Virtually anything is possible with upgrades and additional layers. There is no economic model in the world that would support endless ICO inflation. You clearly don't understand what intrinsic value in crypto means.

Yes, smart contract functionality is not in high demand, given that contracts are managed effectively by third parties today. There may be some value in the concept, but it is certainly not a use case that's in high demand at the moment. Additionally, as I said, all of this can be accomplished as an extension of Bitcoin and it's a much better idea to do it this way because you get all the upside of Bitcoin without the downside of ETH.


It doesn't have a pressing use case. Counterparties manage contracts, just find today. I've never heard anyone make a compelling case for why we need this functionality *now* and, again, Ethereum is a massive hodgepodge of hackable code, forked chains and highly vulnerable attack surface. This would (will) be a healthier idea if it were run as an additional layer on BTC, which is simple elegant and robust, not managed by some central party in Canada.

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:36:41
They can call it whatever the fuck they want. It doesn't make it Bitcoin in the slightest. The only relation to Bitcoin is the shared history before Aug 1. After the point, it is an entirely different project and chain. Once again, in order for the chain to become the "real Bitcoin," it needs to flip at the time of inception. Otherwise, it will never make sense to call BCash, Bitcoin, even if it captures market and network dominance at this point in time, because all of the *Bitcoin* transactions between Aug 1 and the flip would not be included on the BCash chain. Therefore, the history would look like this: Genesis block -&gt; Aug 1st: both chains have identical transactions; Aug 1 -&gt; flip: Bitcoin transactions are only broadcast and confirmed on Bitcoin chain; flip -&gt; onwards: all "Bitcoin" transactions are contained on the BCash chain, except for those between Aug 1 and flip date.
I didn't explain that as well as I could have, but hopefully that makes sense. You cannot have a large gap in time where the chain is temporarily not Bitcoin and then is Bitcoin later on. BCash is now relegated to the alt class of coins and there's no coming back to the Bitcoin name (except if people decide to name the software projects, instead of the chains, which makes no sense, especially given that the software is open source and network consensus is the only validating feature of one project vs another). BCash can never be Bitcoin because they *were the contentious fork*. You only get one shot at a fork and flip. It's an alt.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:16:33
Are you stupid? It's not the original chain because all transactions on Bitcoin after Aug 1 are not on BCash. If you want to fork and take the name, you only have a short amount of time to capture the market and network before you are officially *not Bitcoin* and the original chain keeps the name. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:04:25
Yeah and that makes sense. If you're strictly looking for means of exchange *at this point in time* then BCH is fine so long as the merchants you use accept it as payment. Personally, I don't see many good reasons to not use credit cards for most services that accept them but I can see a few. In terms of the 'money' use case, I just don't see how BCH or any other alt is on the same road as BTC. People love to compare cryptocurrencies to companies and say things like "yahoo came before google, blah blah blah" but this is a meaningless comparison. Cryptocurrencies are open source (for the most part) protocols and money is a networked good, meaning that its strength and momentum increases with use (metcalfe's law). This is actually the reason why BCH has any value to begin with, because they hijacked the usebase of everyone who was using BTC before Aug 1st. Same thing with all of the forks, none of these had to go through the grueling work of establish a market and liquidity because the coins were just airdropped dividends to anyone who was holding Bitcoin at the time. I expect the value to fizzle out further over time because it doesn't even serve its purpose as well as LTC or XMR, which both have decent liquidity and distribution at this point. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:07:43

Yes, essentially. Trust is undermined by centralization. If central parties control the rules (as compared with decentralized consensus) then unit of account and store of value properties are dependent on trust in these parties, which is completely antithetical to what cryptocurrency represents. Central banking is predicated on the belief that these institutions will act with integrity, even though they've shown time and time again to not do so. Is this really what you want out of digital currency? Just a digitized version of the failing institutions we already have? 
There's nothing fundamental to be gained by tokenizing existing frameworks. The principle aspect of Bitcoin is that it's consensus-based and decentralized, meaning that it's trustless and immutable. Centralize that and everything changes.


This is false. Centralization of PoW means that over 50% of the hashing power is under the control of a singular party. Anything short of that does not qualify as centralization.


Wut? Please explain what you mean here. If this is true then Bitcoin is a failed experiment and not worth continuing to develop. Again, the whole point is that it remain decentralized so that key features remain intact.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:20:17


I would agree with this. The utility has value, the implementation, arguably, does not. My point is that there is not strong demand for a decentralized form of that use case, at this point in time.


Apologies - I have a tendency to conflate various comments that I'm responding to in a given time frame on various crypto-related subs. Indeed, there are complete shill/morons that I interact with who write such disingenuous statements that it's hard to not call out the stupidity or shilling for what it is. I'm increasingly tired of the influx of dumb people and scammers into the Bitcoin space and it's exhausting &amp; futile to attempt to introduce reason into the discussion because their logic and comments are circular and devoid of reason. I'm sorry if I pre-judged your comment as such.

Money is a fundamental aspect of society. Tell that to Venezuelans, Zimbabweans, Cubans, etc. Maybe you live in the States or somewhere that doesn't have monetary policy issues, but the third world is largely victim to central banking shenanigans. So you're completely wrong on this point. Sound money is integral for a trade-based society.  


It's entirely different. Ethereum is not decentralized in the same way that Bitcoin is. It's controlled by a company and person in Canada. It's premined. It's buggy and was hacked. The hack was reversed on chain, which just shows that it's not immutable. It's not comparable in any way to Bitcoin, other than that it copies the blockchain functionality, but again it's not decentralized and immutable, which are the fundamentally valuable aspects of a blockchain.


Who? Who cares if the thing is open to revision, as has already been demonstrated? 


Dude, you seriously don't get it. A blockchain that isn't immutable and based on network consensus is just a database with SHA 256. That's not at all like the Bitcoin blockchain. So many noobs in the space just don't understand what makes a blockchain valuable. 


Holy shit, how many times do I have to explain network consensus? I could also get into the economics of how value is derived from an open source protocol like Bitcoin and not by redundant projects but I'm guessing you wouldn't understand that either.
Sorry man, it's frustrating to see so many ignorant people in the space these days. 2017 brought a lot of money to the table but almost all of these noobs just don't understand anything about the fundamentals of the tech and go around spreading misinformation. It doesn't matter in the end, because good tech is resilient and duplicated shitcoins are not but it's disheartening to see so many people getting scammed and shilling complete falsehoods.

Except that BCH isn't a store of value because its model is highly prone to centralization, which undermines store of value and unit of account properties. 
edit: I should clarify that centralization is actually inevitable with ever-increasing big blocks. BCash is simply not a viable project across any significant period of time or scale.

Who the fuck is *them*?
I bought in when Bitcoin was $40. I didn't really give a shit if it went to $0, I was interested in its capabilities and possibility of success. Here we are 5 years later and the "bubble" hasn't popped. Who gives a shit what some people's motivations are for buying and selling, I'm telling you that people who understand what Bitcoin is are likely to believe it has a ton of intrinsic value that is not yet realized. I already gave you examples of famous investors an business people saying the same thing. 
Stop generalizing and stop pretending you know what you're talking about, if Bitcoin didn't have intrinsic value then it would've crashed to $0 by now.

Sure, it doesn't matter what the fuck people call it, the only thing that matters is the history of the chain. People can start calling Bitcoin, Titcoin, and call BCash, Bitcoin and Titcoin will still be the real 'Bitcoin.' The names don't matter, I'm talking about which is the real consensus chain, at that is most definitely BTC and will always be BTC. If another contentious fork happens and another developer group captures the network and market at inception, then *that* would be "Bitcoin" and the "core" chain would be something else. 


Do you not understand what network consensus is? Hashing power? You clearly don't know much about this stuff but you're arguing about something that you really don't understand. Bitcoin is fundamentally a consensus network that updates a distributed blockchain, nothing less, nothing more. The network determines which is and isn't the contentious fork. I could fork the chain right now and start calling it Bitcoin, but if the network rejects it, then it's not Bitcoin.

There is no way you could be confused into thinking there is more than one Bitcoin blockchain if you read the white paper.
Go take this revisionist history nonsense elsewhere. BCash is a scam because its promoters are **constantly** trying to trick people into thinking it's at all related to Bitcoin other than it being a contentious minority chain fork.
It's pathetic that you people just keep pushing this false narrative. It's been a year already and the ratio is **barely** hanging on to 0.1

No, the emergent consensus is *part of the protocol*, not orthogonal to the definition, as you're suggesting.


The white paper is *the* primary document on the topic of blockchains. Not sure why you're ignoring it (and claiming it's not a "reference document [it certainly is]), especially since I just showed you that it defines longest chain as accumulated PoW.
It's increasingly clear that you haven't read the white paper, because you have made numerous errors in referencing what is and isn't contained within. Maybe you should read it. It's only a few pages long.


It is defined as such. Longest chain of contiguous **valid** blocks. This is quite literally how consensus emerges and is the reason why Bitcoin works and double spends don't.


Firstly, I'm not referencing the WP as some sort of sacrosanct document. Quite the contrary. I'm just pointing out that these principles are clearly laid out in the white paper. Consensus, longest chain, etc. The fact that Bitcoin is a singular entity (blockchain) does not rely on the white paper, it simply relies on consensus. If you disagree that consensus is what establishes a *single* Bitcoin blockchain, then you are grossly uninformed.

This is moronic. Consensus literally means *not* the minority chain. This stuff is measurable and you pontificating about the greatness of BCash doesn't change that.


No, the **consensus** is that Bitcoin is the consensus chain. See how that works. Users drive markets, markets drive PoW. 
For more, look through the stats here:
This is really not up for debate. BCash is just another alt. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin, other than hijacking its chain and UTXO set. Beyond that, it's no different than DOGE, LTC or any other alt PoW chain.
Take your idiotic shilling to a different sub.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:28:50
Bitcoin is not just some random product. It is **the** consensus network. It's not owned or controlled by anyone and that's the point. To put *any* of the other 1500 cryptos in this same category is absurd and naive. 
BCash *is* a scam because it's marketed as such. It's a massively overpriced ponzi scheme, no different from BGold or BDiamond or any of the other forks. It's just a method of capitalizing on Bitcoin and BCash proponents are **amazingly** unethical in their promotion of it. 
It would be outright fraud and Roger and co. would be in big trouble for their behavior if this were a regulated space. It's not though, so it's incumbent on Bitcoiners and honest folks to speak out about it being a ponzi scheme scam, which it absolutely is.

I never said it wasn't, duh! Actually the white paper doesn't refer to *any* implementation obvious. Typically, all white papers don't do that because that's not the purpose of a white paper... duh.


Missing a comma, but at least you got the right form of "it's".
Sorry, bro. But the white paper is the document that outlines the principles of what Bitcoin is. The core concepts are still followed as outlined, only secondary aspects like SPV have been disregarded. The main tenants are still respected by the market and network.

That's not necessarily true. Alts bleeding is almost certainly a good thing and analogous to *priming the pump*, regardless of whether it bulls now, next week or 6 months from now. The more alts bleed out in the interspersing time, the better off everyone is.

You said that crypto value is not based on its utility. This is not true for Bitcoin, based on the reasons I outlined above. The utility is the consensus network and additional utility is built off of this framework, but the most important thing is the robust nature of the censorship-resistant network.

That's completely retarded. There is only one Bitcoin. There are several forks with different genesis blocks and now there are several with a shared history w/ BTC. BCash was the first of the latter kind (i.e. the first viable minority chain split). If you don't understand this, then I don't even know what to say other than that you need to re-read the whitepaper. Bitcoin is the network and blockchain, in conjunction with the node software that runs on top. The whole point of Bitcoin is to have a unified network and singular chain. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and everything else, including Litecoin *and* BCash, are alts. BCash is a chain split and Litecoin is a separate genesis block. Quite different.

Also, your claim that more money equals higher prices does not hold up. Unless monopolies exists, competition continues to drive down prices and increasing incomes doesn't hamper that effect. People will just spend their money on *more* things if they have additional money. 
This is discussed a bit [here](
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:28:10


Uh, nope. That's the definition I've been using the entire time. BCash is the first hard fork of Bitcoin. 
Sorry you can't handle being wrong... :/
Throw a tantrum somewhere else, bro.

Litecoin was a **Bitcoin QT** fork, not a Bitcoin fork. Very different. It wasn't a fork of the chain, which is the crucial component that *is* Bitcoin. It was just a fork of the node software, with a new genesis block (and different rules).
Both BCash and Litecoin are alts though. There is only one Bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is consensus around one chain. Anything that deviates from this is an alt, regardless of whether it's a fork or not. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:03:47
How so? 
Did you not say:


With regards someone dumping their BCash?
Not trying to misconstrue words. What am I misconstruing?
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:49:11


Except that it doesn't, you fucking retard. How does a centralized, minority chain fit the terms "consensus" or "most PoW"? You clearly haven't even read the white paper.


I'm not making any mistakes and, *yes*, Bitcoin is a different beast than what's laid out in the white paper, but that was also true of the first implementation of  QT. Nothing ever followed the white paper to a T. 
Bitcoin is much closer to the white paper than BCash. Nothing in the white paper talks about centralized, contentious, minority chain hard forks. Nor does it talk about the EDA or 0-conf. BCash is nothing like what Bitcoin was originally designed as.


Wow, I already quoted the exact part of the white paper that talks about this. Work = length. It says that in the white paper, FFS. It's always been this way. Height doesn't make sense because difficulty adjustments and block time adjustments would just enable any shitcoin fork to capture greatest height. In fact, BCash's height is several thousand greater than Bitcoin. That doesn't mean it's the longest chain.
You're incredibly obtuse. I'm not going over this again.


I don't know if you're just trolling or what, but the word you're looking for is "accumulated". It's amazing that someone who thinks they're so smart and knowledgeable, makes frequent grammar mistakes that not even my 5 year old nephew would make.

This was your reply:








Doesn't address my questions in the slightest and your "scaling" comment about BCash doesn't even make sense, given that BCash is doing 50 kb blocks and half the number of TX's as Dogecoin, FFS.
You're just oblivious to all this clearly, but you can't just admit as much. 
Another prime example of Dunning Kruger effect taken to the extreme. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:38:09
It goes beyond that. There's no reason to think that the network won't eventually converge on a single PoW blockchain, instead of many. There is much greater value in a single, ultra-durable chain, then there is among a variety of separate chains. 
The value is in the network and immutability. Every other use case is derivative of this value proposition, including low-value transactions. The game was never to chase fees down to zero and compete with the likes of Visa. The game was always to create extremely hard money. That's accomplished through strict rule adherence, not gimmicky features and centralized parameter changes. 
BCash is dying (clear), but it can't die fast enough. The fact that their sub appears to be on fire at the moment just speaks to the desperation. I feel bad for the innocent folks that got wrapped up and lost their shirt, but Roger and co. should be ostracized and exiled from Bitcoin permanently. These scammers should be deplatformed and exposed tirelessly so that they can't prey on future victims. Especially Roger and Faketoshi. Both of these people are beyond insidious and repugnant. It's good that they got their pet project, but if for some reason they try to re-enter the Bitcoin community at some point, the answer should be a resounding *"no"*. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:13:12
The value of Bitcoin is in is the durability of its network. BCash is just another shitcoin. 
It's foolish (and unethical) to recommend people invest in asset that don't have a valid first principles case. If you can't explain *why* a nascent shitcoin should be valuable, then the token itself should not be substantially valuable.
End of story.
Take your covert BCash shilling elsewhere.

Bitcoin is not a piece of software, it's a network and blockchain. How many fucking times do I have to explain that?
Here, from the first paragraph (abstract) of the [white paper](


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem **using a peer-to-peer network**.
The network **timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work.** The **longest chain** not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, **they'll generate the longest chain** and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and **nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.**
There's only one Bitcoin, as is **so fucking clearly outlined in the white paper**.
There are different types of Bitcoin forks, plain and simple, regardless of the fact that fork is an existing term. It means something different when you're talking about a *blockchain* than it does with Linux or anything else. The blockchain is what Bitcoin is. The network is a complete graph based on this fact and this is the whole reason why BCash and other contentious forks are opposed.
It's amazing that you can't understand that. It's literally right there in the white paper. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:26:59
This is not an internet argument. I'm searching for the answers to these two questions:
1. **How** would BCash possibly pull off an "upset"? (and what would that even mean in economic terms?)
2. **How** is BCash a hedge against Bitcoin?
If you don't know the answer, that's fine, you can just admit as much. You don't need to turn it into a big argument. I'm not interested in arguing, I'm interested in the answers to those questions.
Looking forward to your response.

BCash is fundamentally an attack on Bitcoin. It's incumbent on Bitcoiners to speak out against contentious minority chains like this.

Semantics? I have literally demonstrated about 10 times over at this point that *BCash was the first hard fork of Bitcoin*. That's how this whole "conversation" started, remember?
Unfortunately for you that is just a fact. Litecoin is a **client** fork and separate blockchain. CLAM was an air drop, which is **completely different from what a fork is**.
You can make a scene if you want and say I'm having a break down or arguing over semantics (neither is true) **OR** you could just own up to the fact that prior to today, you had no idea what the term *Bitcoin Fork* referred to.

Wow you have no clue what you're talking about. It's not "socialism", it's a social program, just like single payer healthcare or anything else managed by the government. Most of the countries with the highest standards of living and best outcomes and measures of success have strong social programs like these (Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, etc.).
The point is not that society goes "fully automated AI society" in 20 years, it's that vast numbers of jobs will no longer be economically or otherwise justified to be given to humans. Even if 10% of jobs are given up to AI or automation, that's a massive gap for the population that needs to be made up for. Re-training programs and finding new jobs for these people to work is only kicking the rock down the road.
It's amazing that you're so opposed to this concept and are shooting it down at every turn when you clearly don't understand anything about it. Maybe, if you're this clueless as to how this stuff works, you should be so critical and maybe you should open your mind and do some reading on the topic before spreading AnCap buzzwords and talking points that don't even fit the situation being discussed ("socialism"?

Good luck thinking that Bitcoin isn't a blockchain.
Isn't it funny how when you google "Bitcoin" and visit its (or "it's", as you'd say) wikipedia page, it refers to a single blockchain, BTC. 
Funny how the wikipedia page doesn't said "Bitcoin is a group of cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin and Dogecoin." It just says that Bitcoin is a BTC and then it lists all the consensus rules that apply to Bitcoin but not Litecoin, Dogecoin or BCash. 
Weird. Wikipedia has it totally wrong. Now that this conversation is over, you should go make edits to the page so that people aren't confused. People (like myself) are completely clueless to the fact that Bitcoin is actually a group of many different blockchains. 
Please go spread this important information, my friend.

Why? It *should* be called by a name distinct from Bitcoin. BCash is a better name anyhow but the point is to draw clear distinctions between the two projects, not muddy the water for the benefit of BCash scammers. 
It even says so right there in their precious white paper: *Most accumulated PoW*. BCash has been an alt since day 1 and its existence is an attack on the Bitcoin network, which is why people should be outspoken about its purpose and the scammers pulling the strings.

No, it *is* a blockchain. I already cited parts of the white paper that defines it as just that. Longest chain, etc. etc. etc. 




Firstly, are you retarded? The word is **its**! Pretty sure they taught that in... I dunno... **very** early childhood, from what I remember.
Secondly, no. Bitcoin is an active chain. It's defined **in the white paper** as the longest chain that follows consensus rules.


No! Go read the white paper, FFS.

He thinks that client forks of QT or Core are the same thing as *Bitcoin forks*. I don't think he understands the difference between Bitcoin and various node implementations.
The above poster seems to confuse forks of client software with forks of Bitcoin itself (i.e. forks of the blockchain).

I don't know why you keep attacking me like this? What makes you think I'm *emotional*? I'm just asking a few questions that you apparently are unable to answer and instead rely on attacks like these. 


Lol, again, these attacks are so weak. The fact that you just constantly deride what I'm saying as "emotional" speaks volumes about the insecurity of your supposed convictions.
Again, are you actually formulating this analysis with the risk and opportunity costs of one coin versus another? It seems like the answer is almost certain "no" and, rather, you're just flying by the seat of your pants.
This is called *gambler's mentality*.


What tantrum? I'm asking what could happen (what set of circumstances could occur) that would lead to BCash leading a charge? I'm genuinely curious and it has nothing to do with emotions and tantrums.

There are *reasons* why Bitcoin is resilient and virtually every other shitcoin out there is ultimately not (at least in terms of sustainable economic rent). 
Sound money is *hard* money and Bitcoin is hard in a way that BCash clearly isn't. This is why Bitcoin is a plausible investment and why BCash is just another shitcoin to be added to the pile of trash. Bitcoin is a network and a blockchain, not just a client software implementation.

**Part of the protocol is the CONSENSUS, SINGULAR CHAIN**


You are fucking dumb as nails. This is EXACTLY what people mean when they say "Bitcoin Fork". 
See here:
**or literally any other list of "Bitcoin Forks".**
As I already explained, there are multiple kinds of forks and Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc are forks of earlier versions of Bitcoin QT **but when people say "Bitcoin forks" they are talking about forks that split the Bitcoin chain, not software forks that are mined on an entirely different chain and set of rules**.
Bitcoin is a chain of contiguous blocks. If you don't understand this then you didn't read the white paper or you're too inbred to understand it.


Oh really? Then how come none of the above lists name Litecoin as a Bitcoin fork. Maybe it's because *you're* the one who's mistaken here. 
**BCash is the first Bitcoin hard fork that created a separate network and market on a split chain. Plain and simple. This is not up for debate. That's just a fact.**

You're just another protypical BCash shill, who whines about how unfair it is that BCash is a total failure. All you guys do is play the victim card. 
Go fix your BTrash if you want people to care about it. Otherwise, stop complaining about Bitcoin and the fact that the market selected Bitcoin over BTrash.

I never said what you're saying is "FUD"
If anything, it's just hilarious trolling. Most people here aren't under the impression that institutional money is in or flowing in at the moment. I think most here have a relatively long view over the long term. 
Bitcoin is just getting started.

But none of those forks have a network. Those were temporary incomplete graphs, nothing more. That's literally part of emergent consensus. This is literally how PoW is designed to work and arrive at consensus.

Are you seeing it now? See how it says "fork" and not "hard fork". Now do you understand?
Seems like you're the one who's having a bit of a spasm. Are you incapable of admitting you were wrong? You said Bitcoin isn't even a blockchain, FFS. It doesn't get more wrong than that.
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:01:47
Just two remind you. I had two questions.
1. **How** would BCash possibly pull off an "upset"? (and what would that even mean in economic terms?)
2. **How** is BCash a hedge against Bitcoin?
You have failed, repeatedly, to answer either. Therefore, I have no reason to believe you are at all informed on the topic of scaling, hedging or Bitcoin in general.
I'm not a missionary of anything and I'm not here telling people to invest in this or that or encourage something that is **not at all negatively correlated with Bitcoin** to be purchased as a hedge against Bitcoin (this is completely absurd, but apparently you can't understand that). 
All I'm looking for is answers to the above 2 questions. Not these stupid personal attacks and suggestions that I'm "emotional". 
You're a one trick pony. On second though, maybe you're a [two]( trick pony. You're exclusively yellow and orange. 
Please, if one day, you decide to address my two very straightforward and simple questions, outlined above, don't be afraid to reach out. I'd love to hear your thoughts.
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:35:03


Lol, well *yeah*. Bitcoin refers to the blockchain and supporting network. The software that runs on top of it is *client software*, not Bitcoin itself. Hence, the name Bitcoin Core or, previously, Bitcoin QT. 
Bitcoin is the consensus blockchain (longest chain).
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:00:33
No, again, you're stupid as fuck.
Bitcoin is a blockchain.
Bitcoin **Core** is a node implementation.
Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin Core.
BCash is a fork of Bitcoin.


Really? *When*? What are they?
I'm eager to hear the names of these various hard forks you're referring to. Especially given that you think CLAMs is a HF, when it most certainly is not.
Please, enlighten me, friend. :)

Lol, get a clue, bro. There *are* more than one type of forks obviously. Even when talking about a singular chain of contiguous blocks, there are still multiple types of forks. 
When someone says "I own Bitcoin" they're referring to Bitcoin, not Litecoin or Dogecoin or BCash. Bitcoin is the blockchain, not *just* a software implementation on the network.
Bitcoin *core* is the software. That's what was forked into Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc. 
It's unreal that you don't understand this. 
Still you have provided *zero* evidence to support your claim, while I have provded numerous links. 
Here's another: 


You're a dumb fuck.
Here's more:










Whoops! Now I bet you  feel pretty stupid... That's straight from the Bitcoin.org website too.
Ouch. Hurry, bro. Delete your comments and pretend this never happened because nobody should have to see this embarassment.
Go. Read. A. Book. I'd recommend starting with *Mastering Bitcoin* by Antonopolous. Otherwise, go find a less-technical hobby, Bitcoin is a bit above your pay grade.

LOL! Okay, hurrrdy durrdy. I can tell you're triggered. I'll stop for the sake of your cardiac health. Stress is bad for the body.
However, just in the interest of clarity...
Accumulative is an adjective. If you're talking about a discreet measurement in time, you need to use the past tense form of a verb. 
"Most *accumulated* work"
This is just basic English. 
I'm guessing English isn't your first language.

No, like I said in [my original comment]( virtually all UBI proposals are fiscal policy measures, not monetary policy (i.e. nothing to do with the central bank). 
The proposal is simply a redistribution of wealth from. Taxes pay for it, not new issuance of money. It's fiscal policy, not monetary policy. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:18:27
Where do you see BCH topping out in terms of global adoption? Once fees are cheap and blocks are huge, what's to limit spam from creeping up, causing fees to rise once again? This is the perpetual spam problem.
Seriously though, have you crunched the numbers on what on-chain scaling looks like for the number of transactions that occur on other payment networks? It's not pretty.
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:16:35
You have no clue what you're talking about. UBI is not only a great, well tested, well subscribed to idea, it's also the only choice we have for a future where there are no jobs because of AI and automation.
Grow up and venture outside your AnCap circlejerk from time to time. You might learn something new and realize that you are not as smart as you might think. 
Or don't and instead just remain in your tight knit circlejerk, fantasizing about abolishing the government. "but muh freedom!"
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:26:25


What? How is the core repository centralization? You realize that Core =/= Bitcoin, right?
Miners vote with their hashing power. There's no conspiracy here. BCH failed to capture the market and hashing power. Therefore it's the contentious fork and should be referred to by a different name.
Not sure why this debate continues to ramble on. Time to just accept the nature of the situation and refer to it as something other than "Bitcoin". 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:29:13


Prematurely? What, you think it will be called Bitcoin in the future? How does that work? There would be a giant gap in transactions between Aug 1 and that time where people buying "Bitcoin" were doing so on the BTC chain. Do you not believe that block**chains** are continuous?
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:25:20


This is patently false. The whole *hard fork versus soft fork* distinction comes down to whether the changes are backwards compatible. Segwit is a soft fork, it doesn't require changes to consensus rules to implement. 
The Core reference client doesn't mean anything in regards to consensus rules.
Not sure where you're getting your info from but it's completely wrong. "Soft fork" is not a marketing term and soft forks *are* better because they don't break mining/node consensus, not sure how you can honestly claim otherwise.


I said the **ratio** is down from ATH, not the fiat pairing (which is also way down from ATH). The general trend is definitely **not** upwards. Again, you're claiming something that is just objectively untrue. Not only is market volume for BCH completely in the shitter (which is an embarrassment given that it benefited from 8 years of existing network distribution before genesis), it *also* is [processing less transactions than Segwit addresses on BTC]( There's literally no way for you to spin this as BCH is suddenly becoming more useful, relevant or valuable. All metrics point towards the opposite conclusion. 
Please stop with this subversive astroturfing. The "facts" you're citing are not facts at all, they're falsehoods. If, ideologically, you support BCH for whatever reason, that's fine but to claim that the metrics are positive is just a complete falsehood. Again, volume, ratio, transactions, etc. all paint a very different picture than what you're claiming. This is what I don't get about BCash shills, these data are not hard to find and yet every shill seems to assume that nobody is going to fact check their claims. Come on, bro, at least be honest about the situation at hand - segw. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:51:14


Go back and read what I originally said. I said that Bitcoin is **its** blockchain and corresponding network. Apparently you can't read, because I said this several times.


Except it is. It's literally laid out within the first few sentences of the white paper. I already quoted it for you above. Go back and read.


LOL! Always some sort of excuse, huh? Can't you ever just own up to your ignorance? It's okay to admit that you don't know everything. Not a big deal!


LOL!!!!!!! **What**? 








Dude, holy cow. You are **fucking retarded**.
From the [white paper](


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. **The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.** If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.


decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.


decision is represented by **the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.**
This has always been the definition, you moron. Total work is is how the chain's length is measured. 
The white paper isn't wrong, it's always been accumulated work. 
What did you think it was, block *height* or something? LMAO!!
Height =/= Length
Dummy, dummy, dummy.... Get a clue.

Try searching the term on Google and reading the definitions.
Furthermore, you're committing a very common logical fallacy, *argument by assertion*. You're not actually arguing a point, you're just claiming (baselessly) that I'm having "spasms," but you have presented no such evidence.
Therefore, you shouldn't expect to compel me to believe your unfounded conjecture.

You are stupid, UBI is not an unfunded liability. Go research the proposals, you unsophisticated, mouth-breathing redneck. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean you're right. In fact, in this case, it means that you're completely wrong.
Also, debt and credit are a sign of confidence in the US economy. It's good to run some sort of yearly deficit.
I wouldn't expect you to understand any of that though because you're thinking skills are on the level of a 4th grader.

I'm talking about what people *mean* when they say Bitcoin Fork. You can play semantics games all day long but the colloquially definition of the term "fork" as it relates to Bitcoin and other blockchains is quite clear.
Remember when you made [this]( asinine comment?


Uh, yeah bro. Bitcoin **is** a blockchain.
Fucking retard. LOL!

That's horrible advice. Long term investment decisions should be made on the merits of the underlying asset, not just grabbing whatever is in the top 10 list. 
Terrible advice.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:25:51
The chain split was contentious (to the network). Segwit, being a soft fork, didn't trigger a chain split.
Sure, the *idea* can be contentious, but the effect on the network is not, which was my point.


Wut? The gap has been widening. BCH ratio is down from ATH and volume and TXs are in the shitter. How can you say that the gap is closing?

What do you mean "who cares?"? *People* care to use technologies that are useful. If Bitcoin continues to prove to be useful, people will buy it and hashing power will go up, in accordance with the value of block rewards. 
The energy is not wasted, plain and simple. It's performing work. You may not like what the energy is being used for, and may think that the energy should be conserved, but it most certainly is not thrown away. 
Bitcoin has value because the chain is secure &lt;-&gt; the chain is secure because Bitcoin has value that incentivized mining
If you're concerned about the planet, you should be lobbying governments to make institutional changes. Regulatory bodies are the ones who have the power to shift to green energy and regulate energy usage. Attacking Bitcoin is a total distraction from the real problem, which is unconstrained dirty energy production and expenditure.

Nodes only know the activity of adjacent nodes (open channels). Payments are onion routed so activity is obscured to observers. Improvements like AMP (splitting up payments across multiple routes) only improves on the privacy.

The energy "wasted" by the incorrect hashes are what demonstrate fairness and ensure Bitcoin's security. It's not wasted in the sense that the system needs this energy to produce a valid block. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:29:34
Like the person said below, PoS doesn't work. PoW works and is a very simple concept. Connecting the security to real world resources is what enables decentralized agreement on the chain. It's not an inefficiency, it's a digital representation of work. 
The car analogy doesn't fit. You can say that Bitcoin *uses* a lot of energy, but it does so efficiently in equilibrium with the price. 
Also, making mining hardware more efficient doesn't change the energy input.
