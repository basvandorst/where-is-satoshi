No. You are able to buy a miner only if ASIC manufacturer decides so, or some of the other miners decide to sell their equipment
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:21:36
What? My point was that ASIC manufacturing resembles more owning land than selling shovels. This is how it works. It doesn't come from conspiracy theory or something, it simply comes from fact that this is the way it makes manufacturer the most profit. Sell when you need to kill competition or your own equipment is getting old or replaced newer ones, otherwise just mine it yourself and have some power over coin you are mining.

That's just standard ASIC mining for you. Sell only when you have some old ones to dump out or competition to shake off and keep most of the hashrate yourself so you can execute things like spam attacks to promote your own coin with very low costs, maybe even profit out of it.

Most likely about altcoins without any critical look on have they really done something new or is it just throwing security under the bus as usual to beat Bitcoin in some aspect, given that how shitty the average crypto "news" sites are. Which is sad as there would be so much material and need for well written articles for regular people about new and upcoming cryptographic technologies. Articles about altcoins would be actually great if they analyze and explain them thoroughly and break down what their advantages are, is there really new tech (especially in terms of cryptography) and/or are they sacrificing something compared to Bitcoin or traditional centralized counterpart if that's more their aim  (like for filecoin).

I'm not confusing anything. You are not thinking through. What happens after said optimizations? People will bring on miners as long as it's profitable for them.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:16:55
No we can't. There is no way to improve PoW energy consumption. What ever PoW is, electricity consumed in it will reflect Bitcoin price. If it's profitable to mine, people will mine. The only way to lower it is to lower block rewards, and that's a thing that is already programmed in.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:45:38
Price of electricity is the most important factor. Can't get price of your miner back if you pay more for electricity than mine. Miners are pricey for consumers pretty much just because manufacturers tend to price them according to money they will be making, not how much building them cost. That's the way it will be, as otherwise they are just better off not selling and mining it themselves. Miners are marketed by their energy efficiency. Innosilicons newest miner has option to mine 18TH/s instead of 24TH/s because it achieves much better energy efficiency at that level.

20% is nothing. You get efficiency fluctuations like that just by having bad or good luck with memory and core, meaning that some good GPUs will be more efficient than average ASIC. More important thing is that those ASICs will be beaten by every new GPU generation.

It sounds little silly to talk about mans here. They are bitcoin addresses, not persons. For your information,  3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r is Bitfinex cold wallet, it's even stated in bitinfocharts list. I'm not really sure what is going on with 1JFd, but the flow of the coins looks automated. Most of it got splitted  to 211.79 bitcoins and then splitted to 10 bitcoins. Some ended up to Bitfinex cold and hot wallets, some sitting in 10 BTC wallets and some to at wallets with 1000 - 5000 BTC. I'm not really expert to say what was the point in the splitting and joining the again, maybe this was just some suboptimal automatic action done to smaller Bitfinex wallet?
Anyway, would not call it really newsworthy.

Small correction to number 2, difficulty is not adjusted only every two weeks, it's adjusted every 2016 blocks, which is two weeks if there is no need to adjust it. For example with 7 minutes block time it would take only 9,8 days.

You are kinda missing the main point here. It's about leveling the playing field, not about which device will dominate. It doesn't matter if ASICs start to roll out on market at the same time or faster than new GPU generation. What matters is that you have the ability to buy hashing power without restrictions/limitations and the new GPU generation forces ASIC manufactures to price their products to what GPUs are offering (instead of what the devices will produce in a year), assuming they want to sell.
Putting perspective on things, the 10-20% advantage we are talking about here is pretty much what new Innosilicon miners have on Bitmain S9. Still we haven't seen real firesale on S9s.. When electricity prices range from .3$/kWh to 0.05$/kWh just inside USA, getting good electricity deal is much more important than that last 10% off it.
As you said ASIC manufacturing will be cheaper than GPU. With only 20% efficiency to gain, I would expect that ASIC manufacturers actually would skip really even trying to hit maximum efficiency and just try to build them cheap as possible and reach somewhat similar efficiency than GPUs. Bitmain already did this with their first generation Ethereum miners, and there should be at least 100% efficiency gains possible.

The point of fighting banks isn't about destroying them. It's about leveling the playground. Even in total crypto world adoption and domination there would be still be banks. Some would of course die and their overall relevance would be smaller and their business models more diverse.

@_date: 2018-08-06 08:54:24
I hoped that you would have tackled [ProgPOW]( in this, but sadly not. Simply put, the idea is that the algorithm utilizes GPU natural strengths and has randomly alternating part. End game being here that ASICs should be able to reach only 10-20% edge on efficiency and some cuts on manufacturing as some parts like graphics pipeline isn't needed.

Entertainment brings joy in our life and helps us relax, which has positive effect on health.
I'm not trying to make it morally superior. My point was just to say that everything isn't so black and white. You don't know and I don't know how this dude makes his money, but if he gets it by entertaining people, he may benefit society more by this way than doing some brainless job. There will be always lots of people who can do that job. There isn't so many people who can pull out show that's entertaining enough for people to give them money.

You may have been over this topic many times, but as bitcoin rises and gathers more and more people and support, you should not expect that they do research. You should shovel the facts down their throats or risk make something like NYA look like a thing that everyone agreed.

Famous people have money? Where it came from? They entertain other people. Same thing as here. Yeah, they pay taxes. Money thrown at them could have ended up taxed some other ways also. What jobs they actually create? I think it's more likely that they actually "rob" job opportunities from smaller artists. People who would actually keep most of their money rolling back to society instead of just sitting top of it and chipping something to charity.

Using bcash mining as evidence of some pools being Jihan / Bitmain controlled is stupid. If it's profitable to mine, people should be able to mine what they want.

Cheaper option than a hardware wallet can become much more costly option when you eventually fuck up with your system and do something that compromises your keys. Also if you value your own time at all, hardware wallet becomes very quickly cheaper than spending time copying addresses and doing signatures manually.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:08:34
There is no next step after you buy your ASIC miner. The first step is to get very cheap electricity contract. After it you calculate how much profit your ASIC miner can do currently with the electricity contract you have and then you check how long it would take to mine back the money you spend on the ASIC miner. If the time is more than a year (or currently, further than the next halving, about 10 months), forget buying ASIC miner. The longer it takes, the bigger the possibility grows that even more energy efficient ASIC comes to market and destroys your profitability. If you are now thinking that "well hopefully bitcoin price rise should save me at that point", you should just buy the bitcoins now than waste it to ASIC.

Dude. With airgapped computer you have to make sure you really copy it right, with HW wallet you just glance over and see that they seem to match. Attacker being able to generate address that matches closely your real address is pretty much impossible. Typoing while you are copying them is much more likely and while it's also likely that you end up with non valid address and that saves you from burning your bitcoins, I personally would not count on it and would spend time double checking that everything is right.
Also, if you are sending bitcoins, with HW wallet you need to only check that the address matches on your computer and on the device. With airgapped computer you need to copy the address you are sending your money first to the airgapped computer, then you need to copy back the whole transaction what your airgapped computer builds for it, which is even more longer and tedious shit.

3. In case it was Bitmain, it might been even profitable for them. If the percentage of spam transactions you need to do to keep fees high is small compared to your percentage of total network hashrate, there is margin for profit.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:51:20
That's the thing you have already counted in when you turned on your million ASICs, this is just a bonus on the top of it. If anything, this could make your not profitable operation profitable again. Of course the rest of the miners would be even better off when they would get also part of the elevated transaction fees.

Main aim is to reduce power consumption, but at the same time that's the main reason cards get hot. Pretty much all the electricity GPU consumes turns to heat. How much power GPU is drawing depends more about how big voltages it is using, not how many MHz it's running on that voltage.

So did they have it, stopped it and then enabled it again or what? I have only read news about them enabling Bitcoin trading straight from their app.

Except when you are controlling like 60% of the hashpower and coin has decent amount of use. Do some spamming in lower levels and get 60% of your spam money back and 60% from the guys that actually use the coin and have to go higher price than your spam.

At least in my experience 90% dudes talking about "how Bitcoin just doesn't have it anymore" are new guys in crypto who don't really even have basic knowledge about how blockchain works and bought in some alt coin because it can do x and are clueless that this x comes in with price of either security, decentralization, increased node requirements or blockchain size bloating.

It's not nitpicky, just how the protocol works and I'm pretty sure there is good technical reasons behind it.

I recommend bitwala. You can use it to pay bills and you can also get debit visa card from them. Their fee is also very low, only 0.5%

From business perspective, 51% attack is not profitable enough compared to mining. Even if everything goes perfectly and biggest exchanges don't for example freeze their market, deposits and withdrawals when they detect big chain reorganization, you could get something like 1B USD before you run out of decently priced orders in market. You would have to have 500m USD worth of Bitcoin ready for this to do the double spends, so real profit is only 500m. Having 60% of hashpower nets you something around 6m USD per day if we assume 8000$ per BTC. You probably gain much more because your mining facilities are in cheap electricity locations in China and this is also without transaction fees, which are something like 1 BTC currently. But let's assume it's just 6m/day. Three months and you have already gotten more profit than double spend. Why do it?
Why not instead create your own coin that tries to compete with Bitcoin, get some fools fall for it and try 'flippenings'. Mine it couple days when EDA + Bitcoin difficulty adjustment + people you have convinced to try flippening. Watch Bitcoin mempool getting even bigger and bigger. Change your fastly accumulated coins back to Bitcoin and switch back to Bitcoin when it now is again more profitable to mine and get 4-8BTC transaction bonus per block. Profits are now more like 9M/day.

No, not fanatical supporters, just elaborate scheme of making more money from mining.

Well looking at that pair history, I wouldn't say that they have never been really stable. But why we should look anything else than pair of the biggest currencies in the world? That's what we are looking with Bitcoin, why we should do anything different with other currency?

Most likely those +1000sat/b transactions are from big exchanges. They usually do one input and something like hundred outputs, which keeps transaction costs somewhat low even with high sat/b fee.

Well it was kinda opposite in the Fall after 2x was dropped. What ever bad news hit or how much blockchain congestion there was, price just kept climbing. It seems that when either optimism or pessimism sets in, it's going to last a while, no matter what you throw at it.

I think altcoins and bitcoins have actually mutually beneficial relationship.

Oh, I worded it poorly. What I meant to say was it's retarded to say something along the lines "Bitcoin network **needs** 32TWh per year to get 6 TPS speed". Point wasn't about approximation or bad approximation, it was about connecting things that doesn't have anything to do with each other.

To me his 20M just seems rounding for the sake keeping things simple, as his estimation being already so vague that dividing with exact amount doesn't have a point.

It's not like it was news to anyone that there was no replay protection, or wipeout protection, or that decisions were to be taken unilaterally in that project. **Everybody knew that from the start, and that was what they signed up for.** For months they were completely silent on the agreement except for the occasional reminder that it's still on.
No, they signed for segwit and 2MB blocks in 12 months. What I have read on most of these leaving NYA announcements is that they didn't know on the time of signing that core isn't on the board with it. Some of them maybe hoped that either core would eventually turn around or btc1 get real development talent behind it, but the closer we get the date, the clearer it is coming that this isn't happening. "We haven’t seen this support and we don’t like what we currently see on the btc1 code repository in terms of technical considerations and open source collaboration."

Doesn't really stop there. Viabtc and btc.top are pretty well connected to them also.

Android flagships aren't also really worth it. It was different couple years ago when low end phones were laggy pieces of shit, but now it's more like that you are paying for 500 extra for facebook app opening 0.3s faster and camera being somewhat better.

Unless it's very shitty discount and/or you are using very shitty exchange to buy bitcoin, you would end up getting more bitcoin by using it and converting saved fiat to bitcoin.

Buy accidently BCH almost at any point from it's creation to end of 2018 and cash out now and you have a fraction of the value that you thought you had. That's how I interpreted the posts point.

So what's better way to show gratitude to a decentralized system than sending Bitcoins to a location where they can be never used someone? You effectively increase the value of every other Bitcoin out there by burning them this way.

Of course some amount of them is forming, it only makes sense in this kind of network. What is important is that it doesn't matter.

First of all, he could move coins that satoshi mined and prove easily that way that he is Satoshi. There would be no questions after that.
Also his writing style differs from Satoshi and way he acts compared to them even more.
If this wasn't enough, he had a reputation of being a con artist and patent troll before he ever decided to claim he was Satoshi.
He also first said that he will prove his identity with moving the coins, took his time and then later claimed that he lost the keys. If you were real deal, why would do this? On the other hand if you are con artist it makes a lot of sense.

If I had any clue how Bitcoin is going to behave in near the future, I would definitely sell and buy according to that. But I don't. On longer time scale I'm pretty confident that cryptocurrencies will reach wealth levels of gold and silver even if they "fail" and stay niche forever and with this target on mind I'm happily throwing some of my extra money on it when the price drops.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:00:37
Have several cryptocurrencies you trust. Instead of holding them, spread them out on exchanges. When there is difference between exchanges that exceed transaction costs, you do selling and buying simultaneously. Then balance your accounts. Very small risk that arbitrage opportunity goes south.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:25:20
What I've seen, this most likely triggers just sellAll function. Though I would like that also, best buying opportunity ever
