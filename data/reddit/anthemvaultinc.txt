Due to FinCEN guidelines we will not be able to accept Bitcoin for gold at Anthem Vault. We used to, but now that Anthem Vault has launched our HayekGold product (a crypto-based asset), regulations are preventing us from accepting cryptocurrency as payment.
We do support the Bitcoin community and hope to find our way back in in due time. Thanks for your question.

We never said everything was fine with Amagi Metals, not something we can speak knowledgeably on. We aren't affiliated with Amagi Metals. Anthem Vault made an asset purchase. We reached out to Amagi's CEO to find out why we were getting customer service calls for their company. He (CEO) said the phone lines were off and CSR was being done over email. 
Not here to advertise today.We have not had any control over Amagi's shipping and customer service. Thank you for your message, and I hope this clears up any confusion you might have.

No customer assets were sold to us. Anthem Vault only acquired hardware and software, no bullion.

Without registering as money service transmitter, we can not take part in the bitcoin ecosystem while simultaneously offering a crypto product in exchange . Our business model would be considered a violation in the eyes of the FinCEN guidelines. Government regulation, strikes again.

Anthem does have some wild, curly hair. :) However he and his company are trust worthy, with decades of transparency and passion as their foundation. To clarify, there is no connection between Anthem Vault and Amagi Metals aside from an asset purchase made back in April.

Hi! Anthem Vault here! 
To clarify, we are not a part of Amagi Metals, nor did we complete any buy or partnership with Amagi. That's why the post was taken down. What was explored, never followed through into a deal. I'd be happy to help the OP get in touch with Amagi Metals to the best of our abilities and as far as we've been told customer service is still active at support
Thanks.

Hi u/erikwithaknotac 
Amagi did not sell the company to someone else. Some assets were sold from Amagi to a new company. The details are in this [thread]( 
Thanks!
