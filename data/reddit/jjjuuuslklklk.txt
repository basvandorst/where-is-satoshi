I'd say buy few used S7's and start mining. Dunno if you're in an apartment or what (Dorm?), but keep in mind that these miners are loud as heck, I mean, annoyingly loud, and they put out an awful amount of heat. The heat makes it so you cant just shove them in a closet and shut the door, you're going to need to port the heat out. Even in a closet they would be very very audible, you would need to sound proof it if it's going to bother anyone. 
To give you an idea of the sound, imagine an electric blower for yards, on a low setting.

Sheeeit, I remember people in 2014 predicting 100k. There may be some people who guessed right, I don't know really; but the fact of the matter is it doesn't really matter what we think, it may go to 10k, it may go to $10, nobody knows, at this point we know the absolutely ridiculous is totally possible (whether that be $10, or $10k), so place your bets! My reasoning in betting on the higher bound of ridiculous is because I think the risk:reward ratio is good. Just picture what the price would be if a million people wake up tomorrow and want to buy one bitcoin. One million people is not that many people at all on a global scale. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:20:32
My biggest fear is bitcoin actually reaching the trillion dollar market cap. I've told so many people about how into bitcoin I am. What if they get jealous, or angry? What if bitcoin really does make fiat seem like junk, and the entire boomer generation's social security payments start to lose buying power even faster? Will they take out their frustration on those who supported bitcoin first? The ones who got it here? 
What if bitcoin really does threaten the sovereignty of states? Have I committed treason? Can they legislate retroactively to convict me, kill me? What if I get on CIA shit lists, FBI shit lists, global banking cabal shit lists... the shit lists go on...
So yeah, bitcoin actually doing what I think it will is pretty scary indeed.

It would have worked well for me, but I chose to support bitcoin by spending and rebuying. I still have some that I save, but even then I am actively spending, and the total I want to save changes from time to time.

Revenue is largely fee-based? I thought their revenue was largely based on the difference in electricity cost vs the cost of the BTC that they mine. I think that *eventually* the revenue may be largely fee based. I think 'partially fee-based' would be a better way to put it.

Localbitcoins was pretty cool. Buying bitcoins from a stranger in a coffee shop was probably the nerdiest thing I've ever done. I think I bought two or three  each, those were the days. Me and the guy definitely had a good conversation, but the premium kinda sucks. The benefit was that you can get your bitcoin that day, and it could be a fun experience. 
I used local bitcoins because I didn't want to wait 5 days to get my bitcoins from coinbase. Nowadays I'm more patient, and I really like their service because It works, and I've only had good experiences with them. I can't attest to all the other suggestions, only the ones I've actually tried. One interesting thing, check google trends for 'Bitcoin exchange' vs. 'Coinbase,' and you'll notice that coinbase overtook the 'bitcoin exchange' search term in volume of searches.

I have never had a single problem with getting a transaction confirmed ever. I use mytrezor for most of my transactions, and I am put in the next block *every time* 
There is 1mb of space per block, it's a limited resource, the demand is increasing, so the price is increasing. I can understand the sentiment that spending $0.25 to send $3 on the bitcoin network is very high, but at the same time it costs me $0.25 to send $10,000 anywhere I want, any time I want, and without anyone's permission. To some people, it's a bargain, to others it is not. Segwit + Lightning looks like a pretty awesome solution and I would really like to see it implemented.

I totally agree. I've been trying to think of a solution to this problem. At some point the current fee estimations will need to bid lower than the highest amount in order to keep fees lower, or else we're just inadvertently constantly 1 upping the next transaction. 
It's times like these I wish I were a better mathematician. It seems like you could bid lower and still have a sufficient fee. If we know the rate of change in which transactions were being broadcast at any given moment, perhaps there is some equation that would offer a means of estimating just how much lower that fee can be. Dunno if that makes sense.

There was a post a couple years back, something along the lines of "They're coming, it's happening, and they're going to try to take your bitcoin from you, because they want it for themselves. They will try every trick they can to get you to sell. They know it's the future, and they don't want a bunch of nobodies having more say than them." I believe the 'them' was the banking cartel.

If there is an attack, then I think it's a combo of attack vectors. A 51% attack wouldn't work, it's to obvious of an attack. If it's an attack then I think this is a combo of the 51% attack w/ concern trolling seizing the opportunity that is Roger Ver and BU. Similar to how the CIA would prop up small but legitimate movements in other countries to overthrow existing regimes.
Furthermore, if there is an attack component to what's currently going on, i think it must be coming from the state level because if it's an attack, it's an incredibly psychologically complicated/advanced attack that only governments have experience with.

I can't help but give him the benefit of the doubt, he may not have been lying, he could have been tricked into thinking they were solvent. Hell, Gavin was tricked into thinking Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. One thing is for sure, if he didn't knowingly mislead people into thinking Mt. Gox was solvent, then the video just makes him look foolish. It must be horribly embarrassing, I honestly feel bad for him because I have had embarrassing things happen to me too.
I think Ver is a highly emotional guy, it's very likely that Ver looked at Karpeles and said, 'be honest with me, are you solvent?' and Karpeles faked a sincere 'yes absolutely' and then they hugged and had a cry, and then went down stairs to have a mocha. Perhaps magic the gathering was involved, maybe later some D&amp;D.

If a bunch of communist chinese hash power and a few useful fools can accidentally kill bitcoin, then it's not meant to survive. I think this is a very important test, and I really hope nothing goes wrong and causes any sort of mass confusion. I'm coming to terms with the fact that there may be BTCu being traded soon, but after that bug got discovered and all those bitcoin unlimited nodes went down...I just don't see how someone smart enough to start a mining empire, and monopolize the mining industry, would put all that in the hands of developers who are clearly having some problems. 
To me that indicates there is something else going on that we're not seeing. Best case scenario it's just Jihan pumping alts and dumping bitcoin, he may soon 'change his mind' after he has sold his alts and re bought bitcoin. Worst case scenario the chinese gov't threatened to do bad things to him or his family unless he did what he was told.

I make a little extra from transaction fees. Somewhere between 6-9% extra usually. It's not much but it's nice. The thing is, I see payment channels putting bitcoin on a whole new level in terms of adoption increase. With payment channels bitcoin may be able to handle micro transactions on a global scale. Payment channels are anchored in a block chain based transaction, so there is a fee involved (Think transactions within transactions). If payment channels can do what they're supposedly capable of, then adoption will increase and may bring a huge increase in blockchain anchored transactions, which may even bring a huge increase in the money miners make on fees. It's all theoretical right now, but the lightning network may really do amazing things for fintech and bitcoin. I think it will, or else I wouldn't support it.

I also don't think you'll get condensation on the boards unless there is an relatively large difference between the temperature of the air and the surface of the boards. Kinda like where I live we get condensation on the windows durning summer when we run the AC and it's like a billion degrees outside. So one thing I wouldn't do is port in fresh cool humid as heck air directly to my miners. I could be totally wrong about this, it would be best to consult a chemist or someone along those lines. Also maybe look at the humidity levels in the areas where the large chinese mines are, try to find out if they have to do anything to avoid condensation. That's really cool what you're doing by the way. Please post pictures, or make a youtube video one of these days!

The genius part about bitcoin is the game theory behind it. Game theory is a *science,* you can win a Nobel prize for it. How anyone would want to risk the priceless network effect we have, by altering components of the game theory that got us here in the first place, not only blows my mind, but pisses me off. 
We have ONE chance here people, ONE chance to take the power back from central banks, so for all the people in the world's sake, I am pleading with you, take a few minutes to consider the facts, and at the very least make sure you have weighed out the risk to the best of your abilities. 
Right now what I think people need more than a network that can handle micro transactions, is a network that allows them to hide their money from the government. What do you think the cost of that transaction would be worth? Is $0.10 too high? What about $0.50, $1.00, $100.00? I've worked too hard for my money, traded pieces of my life for it, protecting the value of my money is important to me, as it is likely important to everyone else, and I'll be damned if I'm going to risk losing the best safe haven to be created since the big bang because I want cheap transactions. Rushing a hard fork for cheap transactions so that everyone in the world can afford them is just plain not a good enough argument for me want to risk ruining this sanctuary currency right now. If you can't afford a bitcoin transaction then go use an alt coin like litecoin, or go start BU as a new coin now if it's so fucking great. 
Edit: John Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994 under the heading of 'Economic Sciences,' 
From the wiki article on him:
**Game theory:** (Section 2.1)
"Nash earned a Ph.D. degree in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.[13][14] The thesis, which was written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium. **A crucial concept in non-cooperative games, it won Nash the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994."**

Begin rant: 
Everyone FFS,  blocks are not 'full,' there is 1mb of space per block and it is sold to the highest bidders, If you can't afford to get into a block that doesn't mean the blocks are full, *it means you can't afford to get your transaction into a block,* tough shit, stop trying to misconstrue it. Instead, go use one of the altcoins, something with lots of free megabytes. Hell, something that allows you to send the equivalent of 1000 satoshis back and fourth to yourself for free all day long. Or better yet, just *go start an altcoin to fit your beliefs if you think it's so much better.* 
Don't come here and lie to me about blocks being full, or complain about confirmation times when you're too cheap to pay a network fee, and then hide behind some bullshit altruistic attitude that... 
*Que music* 
"What the world, needs now, is cheap, trans-actions."  
...then in the same breath have the nerve to point the finger at the *core devs?* And you expect us to believe your conspiracies about them, as if many of us who have been around for years haven't become familiar with them, and thankful for everything they've done for the past few years? Do you *really* think we're that fickle?
I'm going to stop my ranting now and end with this:
Honestly, I want there to be competing cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrencies that compliment one and other. Like Andreas A. said, we are accustomed to having currency be a zero sum game, because we have to use the flag money of the country we live in, but ever since the original white paper came out, *it's no longer a zero sum game.* People are now starting to be able to choose which currency they want to transact with, and that's great!

I figured a 10% premium wasn't that bad, considering where I thought the price was going. Turns out I was right. I still kept on with the verification process at coinbase though, now I'm super glad I did. Instant buys are the shit, but you have to build a reputation with them to get a significant limit to your instant buys.

I think this is an attempt to garner enough support to make the implementation of a hard fork scary enough for a moderately substantial dip in the price. That way they can short the market and make a HUGE profit, and then buy actual bitcoin for a lower price. 
Think about people like the guy "The wolf on wall street" is about. He made tons of money pumping/dumping penny stocks.
The best thing for this alleged group is that there is no regulation in bitcoin markets. Pumping/dumping and spoofing are not illegal. This is prime time for a group of smart people to take advantage of this lack of regulation. 
This argument is not about wanting/not wanting regulation. I'm just trying to point out another possible scenario for what's going on. 
Thanks

It might still work out. Dollar cost averaging is great if you don't want to expose yourself to one particular price. It depends on how confident you feel about the current price. 
I think if I had dollar cost averaged my way in over 3 years my average cost would be $50 to $100 lower. But, I like to gamble, and I'm impulsive, so yeah, there's that.

Would the flex cap block size be implemented by hard fork or soft fork? I ask because to my understanding a hard fork is one of the greatest threats to the network effect; thus, a hard fork would be a greater threat to bitcoin's success. We need to protect the precious network effect, and not risk disrupting it's current growth trajectory. 
The reason I am so concerned about this, is because people have been pearl clutching over full blocks, yet to this day I have never had an issue having my transactions confirmed within 10-20 minutes. 
I understand that the current version could not handle micro transactions in its current state, but SW and LN may be able to mitigate that issue. If we rush into increasing the block size, or allowing miners to choose block size, we wont even get to see what SW and LN can do in real life; furthermore, we would expose the precious network effect to a higher level of risk of destruction. 
Like you said, bitcoin has the network effect, meaning it has the best chance of any digital currency of succeed. Why run the risk of destroying bitcoin's precious network effect when you can have your cake by starting a new coin? It seems evident to me that a superior alternative currency will have no issue garnering enough support for its own network effect, since the inferior small block bitcoin is doomed. Why not get in early?

You're right. There's no reason to conclude that we have only one chance. I'd just rather be safe than sorry, and assume we only have one chance in the eyes of the people hesitant to adopt bitcoin. I mean, Mt. Gox alone made most of my friends afraid to get involved with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. If I bring the topic of cryptocurrency up to them --let alone mention bitcoin specifically-- it's like I'm shitting at their breakfast table and trying to sell them a scam. I have no idea what the conversation would be like if we had a failed hard fork, or critical failure to the likes of the one that occurred early in bitcoin's history. The reason why I don't think that failure ruined bitcoin forever, is because It happened when there weren't enough people around to see it. We have no idea what would happen if a failure with a similar magnitude occurred again, and quite frankly I don't ever want to find out. It kinda feels like we're running with a cookie, thinking that if we drop it in the mud and it gets all dirty, we can just dust it off and sell it like it's a new clean yummy cookie; but nowadays millions of people interested in buying cookies are watching us run with the cookie they might buy.

Suppose we adopted this block size proposal instead of the SW soft fork, and initiated a hard fork to implement larger blocks, and it didn't work out well, and the warnings about bandwidth and mining centralization turned out to be true.
Now suppose that never occurred, and we went ahead with a SW soft fork, and that turned out to be a miserable failure. 
My question is, which of these options would be harder to roll back to where we are now and why? Then, if one were harder to roll back than the other, which one is more risky going forward?

Also, some people with old wallets choose to sell large amounts off of the exchanges, this could be old coins changing hands. It's a win win for both parties involved. The seller usually gets to sell above market price, and the buyer doesn't have to worry about the change in price buying a large amount may cause on an exchange. If someone buys 10,000 coins on bitfinex right now, the price would be ~$1020 by the time they buy their last coin.

John Nash won in 1994 'Economic Sciences.' He also probably created bitcoin, but that's a whole other topic and most definitely a conspiracy theory, haha. 
I clear up what I meant by having one chance in another comment in this thread. There's no way to quantify how many chances we might have, I know that, it just seems reasonable enough for me to assume that considering what we have to risk. 
Inflammatory or not, looks like we agree on at least one thing :) cheers. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:45:21
:) I talk about what I meant somewhere in this thread, but yes you're right I don't mean it literally, because there is no way to know if we will or will not get more chances like this one; however, I think it's best to assume this is the only chance in our lifetimes, because even though you're right - we don't know how many subsequent chances we will get - the *timing* matters a lot, and the timing seems *perfect* right now IMO. 
Considering what is currently going on in the EU, India, and Venezuela we now have the opportunity to lithify bitcoin's status as a hedge against central bank failure, and/or government overreach. Couple that with the fact that there are still millions of bitcoin left to be mined, thus an incentive for us non-cooperative parties to play the game. 
Even if we do happen to get a second or third chance, we don't know if the timing will be as good as it is now.
Edit: I should add that the fact that the person who created bitcoin has not moved a single satoshi is a huge selling point. Any subsequent attempts will unlikely be able to yield a founder who would be willing to never spend the hundreds of millions of dollars they are sitting on. Plus the allure of the mystery would be hard to reproduce. Subsequent attempts in the wake of a bitcoin failure may be subject to higher levels of scrutiny if the lead developer will not do it for free and never spend any, and not do a pre-sale, and never reveal themselves or speak again after a certain point etc. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:53:36
It's pretty much their last chance to destroy bitcoin at a reasonably low cost. It also could be people trying to do a HF for the purposes of shorting the BTC market. Even if they're not even close to having enough support for a successful HF, they may have enough support to make the implementation of a HF scary enough for some people to sell. So they might be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on this campaign, but they stand to make millions of dollars shorting the market, and then buying low after the dust settles.

The ledger nano S and Trezor are both equally great. One cool thing about the Trezor is that you can also use it as a password manager, and I think a 2FA tool as well. I have both and they both are equally great IMO. One difference is that on the ledger you enter your pin on the device, whereas on the trezor you look at your device to see a jumbled up number pad, and click the corresponding buttons on your screen. I think the trezor's method is a little more safe, because an attacker would need to see the trezor and the computer screen at the same time, as opposed to just the screen of the bitcoin hardware wallet.

I'm pretty sure only a handful of people will actually be spending bitcoin in Japan. 99% of these people who will spend bitcoin are probably already into bitcoin, or already own bitcoin. This is just PR for the businesses. It's a nice symbiosis, these businesses gain exposure in the Japanese media, and bitcoin gains exposure in the Japanese media. Adoption will probably hardly increase because of this, but I'm sure at least a few people will want to buy some bitcoin because of the news, but most importantly it plants seeds in the minds of many other people who may one day decide to buy bitcoin.

(One of) Bitfinex's bank stop processing their (USD) wires (Wells Fargo). They're (Bitfinex) having issues due to the bank's actions. Word on the street is that people are scared and are buying bitcoin at a higher rate on bitfinex, because bitcoin withdrawals are working fine on bitfinex. That would explain the difference.

I believe the resistance to change is a feature, not a problem. Much like a democratic republic, where the constitution can't be easily changed, unlike the hearts/minds of the people, which change on a whim. The 'consensus problems' are what protect bitcoin from the artifices of designing men. :)

I think they were waiting for 51% of the last 1000 blocks. I figure that would have been the best time to use it. Like Andreas said, if you fork the network at 51% you're only a few blocks ahead any given moment. This could have gotten them further ahead during that time. 
Covert asicboost could be used to gain more and more power in the network. Jihan could have used his extra profits to purchase more and more hashing power. He may have been using the profits to fund the purchase of a bunch of secret asics he hasn't turned on, but would have when the chain split. Pretty scary combination of attack vectors.  
I'm glad it was discovered, the network is even stronger now.

Unfortunately we can't just go storing any amount of data on the ledger all willy-nilly, there's a 1mb limit per block, bidding starts at 1 satoshi. You gotta pay to leave a permanent record on the decentralized immutable ledger. That being said, prices per transaction have only been exceptionally high during spam attacks. The rest of the time prices per transaction were pretty damn low, and I mean low *for what you're paying for:* Freedom and privacy.
Bitcoin most likely will never be the global transaction unit for every transaction ever. We don't even need a decentralized network to do that work. What we do need is a secure financial network that protects our ability to transact freely, privately, and without a centralized point of weakness. We must protect that at all costs! 
This song is dedicated to you bitcoin.

I've seen it go up or down 10-20% in a day on a number of occasions. 2k is feasible but *highly* unlikely, 10k in a day is probably about as likely as correctly guessing a private key. 
I know your struggle though. Although I feel like whenever I think it's going to go down and I wait, it goes up, but when I think it's about to go up and I buy, it goes down. Haha. 
Best thing is probably just by very small amounts, and avoid panic buying on sharp price increases, or panic selling on sharp price drops.

If I knew my taxes were really only going to good social programs, education, and infrastructure then I would actually totally be ok with it. It's the fact that they don't go where they're supposed to that gets me. I actually think that it would be cool if individuals could decide where their own taxes went, so if you wanted 50/50 schools/science then you could indicate that on your tax forms. An open ledger system like bitcoin could facilitate something like that, and allow for the individual to see that his/her taxes are being distributed where they're supposed to.

Pay your debts, don't gamble. If you get into a situation where you're able to easily make your payments on your loans, and pay living expenses, then consider buying bitcoin. 
Then when you're in a healthy position to buy:
Just do the math, there will only be 21 million bitcoins. Right now they're &gt;$1000 each and it's a niche thing. Now imagine if 1,000,000 people wake up tomorrow and want to buy a bitcoin. What do you think the price of a bitcoin would be by the time the millionth person bought theirs?
Now consider that 1,000,000 people on a global sale is not that many. 
I hope that helps. To summarize, no it's not too late.

This 'treasure hunting' may take on more forms than trying to guess at random private keys. There may be more investigation into the history of a particular lost wallet, like how modern treasure hunters look at the history behind a lost treasure chest full of gold. 
For instance, some known darknet criminal may be murdered, his public key exposed, and the type of wallet exposed to suggest he/she used an encrypted passphrase. Then people may take a psycological approach to figuring out what sort of words he/she would have probably chosen to form a password. Then brute force the wallet, 
but base the brute force on the educated guesses deduced from postmortem psychological analysis.

Just because people are heavily investing in a currency doesn't mean it will replace bitcoin. There's a lot of money being made fooling people into believing that (insert coin bad guy is heavily invested in) will replace bitcoin. That's where the money is right now, preying on people's hopes of finding the next bitcoin (insert myspace facebook analogy). It's true that another currency may replace bitcoin, but it's also true that you can make a lot of money off that potential replacement.

I'm just pointing out the flaw in your analogy, but I get your point. The main difference I see is that there's more to stake in money, than in religion, that's why I'm pointing out the token of value thing. I do sort of agree with you, but I do not find religion to be a good analog.

They're not inversely related at all. Any inverse price motion is either a coincidence, or timed market manipulation to make bch look like a hedge against bitcoin. 
BCH has been trending down because it was given to bitcoin holders for free. Yet somehow there are people stupid enough to buy it. Probably because they've been fooled by Roger Ver, and his army of misinformation trolls. 
Just do your homework. Rather than buying BCH like a fool, why not just cut to the chase and send Roger Ver your money directly. Not that it matters. If you're stupid enough to fall for all of his bullshit, and you're investing money, you're going to eventually lose your money anyway. A fool and their money are soon parted.

The banks should just embrace bitcoin. If they offer wallet services with bitcoin, people probably won't care that they could do it themselves without a bank, and would likely feel more safe using the bank. Within the bitcoin services, the banks could charge fees in bitcoin, and hodl the bitcoin they gain from the fees. People are ignorant, they won't fucking care if the fees are a couple hundred satoshis. 
Better yet, the banks should facilitate the 'spare change to bitcoin' thing. Oh man, there has got to be a young bank executive out there who sees the potential. Bitcoin is becoming cool, people are intrigued. They may even open an account with the bank just to use the cool wallet, or spare change service.

It's a money grab. No doubt, in multiple ways. Probably planned for years. Plan probably went something like this: 
1. Buy shitcoins like ripple for pennies. 
2. Politicize scaling debate.
2. Hire the best rabble rousers and astroturf specialists money can buy. Hire coordinators who know how to use the entire penny stock pump and dump playbook. Use rabble rousers to induce fear and pump altcoins by making altcoins appear to be in position to overtake bitcoin. 
3. Leverage Jihan Wu's interest in keeping all scaling on chain due to his monopoly on the use of asicboost. 
4. *Slowly* sell off the altcoin position over the span of the debate, sell slowly for months and manipulate swings in the meantime. 
5. Hard fork bitcoin. Try to make it as subversive as possible. Use bots to fake trading volume on 0 fee exchanges. Implement fake short term support for the price of the hardfork altcoin. 
6. At this point they've already made a ton of money. Improvise the next move based on the support for the fork, and the market reaction at the time. 
7. Short the alt coin market. All of it. Go long on bitcoin. 
8. Murder a young virgin, drink her blood, and feast on the rest of her. Hail Satan.

They could just cut off exchanges access to ach/wire transfers/banking accounts for anti money laundering reasons. It wouldn't kill bitcoin, but force  people who want to buy/sell to have to do in-person transactions. You gotta get fiat into bitcoin somehow for the whole thing to work.

Because doing it via UASF prevents us from going full retard and implementing the additional 2mb block size increase. Segwit already is a maxblocksize increase.

I don't think (Arbitrary number)mb maxblocksize increase is horrible, it's just not the best solution. 2mb + segwit is just redundant, because segwit increases maxblocksize. No need to do it twice.

Then you have alt pumpers jumping on in a sort of parasitic relationship, and I believe a few of the more dedicated and subversive buttcoin trolls of yesteryear (they are funny because they think they were helping people, but in reality they just took away a nice opportunity from anyone they talked out of bitcoin).

Of course no one wants to stall just to stall. The point is that they stall the ideas that are about to go through, so they can buy time to  have things their way. 
One way to slow the implementation of the UASF is by confusing the community into thinking they will be getting segwit anyway, so there's no need to keep pushing for the UASF. While in reality it's just a bait and switch. 
You're right though, no one wants to stall, they just want things their way. If it looks like they're not going to have things their way, they'll stall so they can get another chance, rinse and repeat.

I read somewhere that segwit is a capacity increase, which is technically distinguishable from a blocksize increase. Where segwit increases the *effective* blocksize. Is this accurate?

It can't steal your coins. In order for someone to steal your bitcoins they'd need your private keys. You wouldn't store them on/in your node.

I think it's silly to increase the blocksize twice (segwit + 2mb blocks). I know we've reached an apparent impasse here, but compromising just to appease both sides is not how you design good tech.

Segwit increases the blocksize, so it sounds like your saying 'You could agree to have a blocksize increase and a blocksize increase, which is superior to just a blocksize incrase.' 
There almost certainly won't be a chain split because bitcoin users want segwit (segwit is a maxblocksize increase!). Nobody will prefer to use the legacy bitcoin that can't use the lightning network (becauses it doesn't have segwit), that still has 1mb blocks (Unlike the segwit bitcoins), and that has the maleability problems (Guess what, segwit fixes that).
So you think a bunch of miners are going to keep hashing the non segwit version of bitcoin? No, they want the most money they can get, so they wont want to waste money by mining invalid coins.
There is nearly a 0% chance that there will be a contentious divide in the community after UASF activates. If you're concerned about a chain split, just consider the chances of a chainsplit to be inversely proportional to the current overwhelming support for segwit.
The UASF is happening, and we're activating segwit prior to the consideration an *additional* increase to the maxblocksize. ;)

If you have more that $1000 worth, get a trezor, or a ledger nano S. If you want to go cheap, you can get an Opendime (No backups for the opendime). 
With trezor or ledger you will have a 24 word backup seed and a pin. You'll need to store your backup seed safely as it is the only way to restore your wallet if you lose your bitcoin wallet device (whichever one you get). For backing up my seeds I use cryptosteel, and those go in my safe deposit box. 
I highly reccomend the trezor or the ledger nano S. The trezor is cool because it has some other uses, like a password manager, and a 2FA login key device (Sort of like a key to a car). I'm actually considering getting a second trezor just for that use. I hate resetting my passwords.

I think they have some tricks up their sleeves, but they have to be patient and wait for the right moment. They can't risk giving the enemies ammunition to discredit them, especially when it comes to decentralization. 
We only see the battle as it's played out on the surface, for all we know there may be state actors attacking bitcoin as well, which is very scary if you consider the fact that the state is the most experienced when it comes to manipulation of public sentiment.
We just need to be patient, and trust our own judgement for now.

There are always a bunch of people out there thinking "Bitcoin is interesting, next time it goes down I'm going to buy some." That was me not too long ago. I noticed the first 230 spike on the news, and decided to keep it on my radar. Luckily the silk road bust was big news, and it reminded me that I wanted to buy some. It also made me realize that bitcoin had value outside of the darknet, which made me want to research, i though "*why does this still have value?*" So I found r/bitcoin, did a bunch of research, asked a bunch of noob questions, got a lot of help, and I have been obsessed ever since.
I sold many of those that I bought back then on the first run up to &gt;$1000, I couldn't resist the urge to sell because I had doubled my money! Wow! lol. I've been buying little bits for the past couple years to average my way back in.  
Bitcoin changed me in so many ways, it changed how I think of money, it got me started programming, it completely changed my political views, I learned about the NAP, bitcoin is the best!

Perhaps, it would be interesting to find out. I guess we will eventually. I wonder if there would be disproportionate selling (GBTC vs actual bitcoin price).
Also, at some point the value of the flag money would effect the apparent price of bitcoin. I think in times like those, people flock to cash, pushing the value of the flag money up. This would make gold/silver have an apparent drop, thus bitcoin would too (I suppose). 
I guess it all depends on the nature of the drop in the markets. In 2008 people thought the entire world financial system was going to collapse, vs 2000 where the NASDAQ was just in a bubble.

Are you too impatient to make a sleeper account and post on r/technology, or r/programming for a while before concern trolling here on r/bitcoin ? I mean, it's painfully obvious what you're doing...
Edit: I think this is the lazyest troll I've ever seen. Check out his 2D low energy chess move down below where he links to a single comment of him 'supporting the UASF.' Oh wow you're so credible now!!! Oh wait! My bad, *use* to support the UASF but now he's 'done his research' he's no longer a brainwashed blockstreamcore zombie! **Totally not an obvious concern troll tactic, nothing to see here**. Anyone who frequents T_D has seen the same tactic 1000 times, "I used to support donald trump, but now that he cut in front of that guy, I question his diplomatic abilities derpity dur durrr." 
Here's a gem from the 'I'm totally not a concern troll' UASF supporter's comment history. I archived everything because I'm assuming he'll delete his comments and possibly his entire account based on this epic failure/concern troll unmasking. If you're shilling, they should fire you because you're literally the *worst shill ever.*

The asterisk denotes that the currency is not mineable. You can refer to the math below and come up with the same 'market cap' yourself, based on the numbers in coinmarketcap. $0.302807 x 38,305,873,865 (Xrp in circulation) =  $11,599,286,747
OP is answering the question  "Why does ripple have such a big market share" in the first line of their comment, as I noted in the previous reply. After answering the question, OP then goes on to state why they consider the market cap inflated. 
Your reply was then:

I think there will be an increase in demand, but the demand will not come from people who are buying to pay their ransom. The buys will come from people seeing bitcoin in the news, which is a similar situation to the silk road bust, where people thought bitcoin was done because the silk road went down, but really the price went up because people realized it had value outside of the darkweb. The recent news will simply remind the people who already had bitcoin on their radar that bitcoin is still here, going up in price, etc. It will likely get them to finally buy.

He is spreading the truth about the Tienanmen Square Massacre on the bitcoin blockchain in mainland China. He is standing up to the Chinese communist regime's censorship, and works to subvert them by using the freedom allowed by bitcoin, a currency which bypasses the PBOC which his business (bitmain) is entirely based on.

No it isn't. It's like raising the maxblocksize twice. This agreement is redundant, and I (among others) believe the purpose of this agreement is to impede the momentum that the UASF is gaining.
The UASF will activate segwit on august 1st, it will increse maxblocksize, fix malleability the issue, and make bitcoin ready for the lightning network. After segwit is activated, the community can then decide if we need to increase maxblocksize *again*.

The way I think of seeds, although this may not be technically correct, is by thinking of a seed as a 24 word list that is an encrypted version of my 50 character private key. 
So say your private key were 'hu23r8pwfeuiewfkjfwe98p62' (I just mashed the keys). And I wanted to make it so when I typed the word 'llama' it spit out that private key. Now instead of 1 word, picture 24 words that when entered in sequence would act like 'llama' and spit out my private key. I hope that helps.

Most of the criticism of bitcoin that's used for the purpose of pumping 'better alternatives' is based on the selling point that 'bitcoin can't scale, so (insert alt) will take over'. Once segwit is activated, that narrative ends, and all the alt money returns to bitcoin. Trust me when I say this, there will be a HUGE short term fluctuation when it it is evident that segwit is finally going to get activated. I expect this to happen a few weeks, or maybe even a month prior to the august 1st deadline.
If you buy bitcoin now, you're buying the rumor. Remember, buy the rumor sell the news.

@_date: 2017-05-26 06:45:58
Right on! They must be under the assumption that we're stupid, since they think we can't see right through this 'agreement' BS. Segwit will increase the maxblocksize, fix the maleability issue, and the best part is we'll be lightning network ready as of August 1st! After we soft fork to segwit, we can assess the situation and hardfork to 2 mb if need be, but only after segwit is activated via UASF.
FELLOW SPARTAINS! Run a UASF node if you want to help out, if not, don't let the concern trolls get to you, segwit has overwhelming support! UASF!

Are you waiting for a particular price point? It still may come. Although, when the price gets down there it will probably be hard to push through the hesitation to buy, because of the potential for it to go even lower. I've been there, haha, it makes me anxious just thinking about it. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:36:46
UASF not going through is probably my main concern right now, but I'm confident that even if it doesn't go through (It will) that segwit will be activated sometime soon after. It's just good tech, and an awesome upgrade that's going to make bitcoin way way way better than it already is. I welcome anyone who wants to continue this rally to run a UASF node ASAP. Cheers.

Isn't that what happens when someone tries to sweep a cold storage wallet, but only sweeps part of it? I remember something along those lines, where if I were to sweep my paper wallet, I would sweep all of it in one transaction to ensure this issue wouldn't happen. 
The guy this happened to was able to contact the pool that mined the block with his transaction, and they were nice enough to send it back to him.

Do you have a friend or family member that could go for you? You could even pay them a little bit. You're gonna pay about 10% premium on localbitcoins. I remember doing the same, but I didn't mind that because I felt that I would get that 10% back when the price went up (as I though it would).
Can you link a bank account to coinbase? The debit card system is probably way more likely to not pass their fraud prevention algorithm. I have not had an issue with the bank transfer method. 
The other thing you could do is wire money to bitstamp. This can be done without leaving the house for most banks.

Anyway, so they thought bitcoin had no potential when it was $250, but then eth gets a bump and they're all like "Eth is the next bitcoin," and I'm sitting here thinking "Well wait a minute now, you didn't see bitcoin's potential, and you wrote it off, but now eth is the next *bitcoin*?"

You're correct. I've been making a stable $12 a day worth of bitcoin  on average, this has been pretty steady even with the price increase and difficulty increase. One doesn't seem to be outpacing the other. I should note, I keep all my bitcoin mining rewards, I think of mining as a way of dollar cost averaging at a discount rate. On a side note, this other guy *really* doesn't want you to mine bitcoins. Haha
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:58:32
I think bitcoin is getting hit from a few directions.
I think you're right in that it's about influence in where the network goes. Next up is schnorr signatures which will help bring a lot more privacy to transactions. I heard that if schnorr signatures are implemented China will likely outright ban bitcoin, if they do then bitmain goes bye-bye. 
The 2nd angle is pumping alts. Make it seem like bitcoin is old tech and can't advance. Do whatever it takes to make bitcoin look bad, and the lower cap alt's look good.
Also, I think many in the eth community would like to see bitcoin do a HF, that way they don't feel so alone in their whole DAO eth classic fiasco. If you think people aren't going to mine the minority chain just to fuck with bitcoin, then I think you're wrong. It would be a great way to hurt bitcoin's reputation. All it takes is a few exchanges with no fees, some bots, and you have trading volume and a market cap, so it goes. 
So from the bottom of my heart, I really do not like you Jihan, Roger, and Jeff. Please just stop.

Which doesn't imply that Satoshi thought we *must* have on chain scaling in order to rival visa, nor does it imply that he thought we should. It simply implies that he thought on chain scaling *could* someday rival visa, which is a far cry from the regularly used statement that satoshi thought the 1mb limit was temporary. I think your misunderstanding is that since he thought on chain scaling could one day rival visa, that satoshi thought we must have on chain scaling to rival visa. 


This quote is from the context of a discussion about how a maxblocksize increase *could* be implemented. "When we're near the cutoff block number" is in reference to the hypothetical method in which the maxblocksize increase *could* be implemented. 


I'm arguing semantics, not pedantics. My point is that satoshi never said that the 1mb limit was temporary, however, he also never said it wasn't temporary. So no I'm not truly disagreeing that satoshi saw this limit as temporary, but that doesn't mean that I'm agreeing that he did see it as temporary based on the quotes people regularly reference.
I am arguing semantics, because without taking a close look at the context an meaning of the words, then the quotes can be used to mislead those who will not take the time to understand them. I've seen this happen a number of times on r/btc and on r/bitcoin. People regularly seem to mix up 'could' and 'must'.

I honestly don't know how to show my gratitude for the work you and others have done.
With the extra money I made from bitcoin I was able to afford a moderately priced used toyota 4runner, with pretty low mileage. It's the perfect vehicle for the job I just got because it's reliable and has some clearance for rough terrain. I wouldn't have been able to afford a reliable SUV if it weren't for all the hard work y'all have put in. I mentioned that I bought the SUV with the job in mind in my interview, and they were impressed with my enthusiasm, so having the SUV may have also had the added benefit of helping me get an entry level job in my field. 
That's just SOME of my gratitude. I am mostly thankful for the work you put in, because you're giving humanity a very important tool. I think you and other bitcoin developers will go down in history as the founding fathers of the financial renaissance. 
Thank you very much.

Wait a sec, you're unhappy about this? It's ok if people don't immediately see bitcoin's potential, some people just don't have that much vision. I was even skeptical at first, but came around in a few months, not because of a price increase, but because I understood the tech (and implications in regards to global finance). 
That being said, I'm happy about the fact that people are changing their mind about bitcoin. If everyone already thought bitcoin was great, and had amazing potential, I would not be able to afford even one bitcoin.

The alts also don't have bitcoins story.

There's a spectrum of use, highest being Bitcoin, and lowest being...I don't know, clams? If the demand for cheap on-chain transactions is so high, then I think it's great that there's a number of options to choose from. I'm not really afraid of lightning being too late for anything, bitcoin security is what matters to me. So provided bitcoin doesn't go full retard and increase the maxblocksize by 2mb along with segwit, I don't mind losing transactions to Ripple in the meantime. I think a lot of that money will return to bitcoin afterwards, but who knows. I'm glad you agree with me on the whole segwit being the right option thing. cheers. Support eth classic ;)

I remember a time when buttcoiners were actively trying to stop bitcoin adoption. They weren't subtle at all about it. I'm starting to think that many of those same trolls have disguised themselves as BU supporters. This accounts for only one faction of the trolls. 
The next faction would be the alt coin pumpers. There are a lot of alt coin supporters who can make more money by preventing bitcoin from upgrading. They can easily pump their alt as a better alternative because they have "XYZ and bitcoin can't even scale." What makes matters worse, is if there is a coordinated effort to do so, then they may pour some of their alt coin pumping profits into there efforts to block segwit. Rinse and repeat
The third faction would be individuals involved with a government, or coalition of governments who would like to put an end to the cryptocurrency menace. 
Its all a game. We have the best game right now, and there are so many people trying to out game our game.

@_date: 2017-06-03 22:18:18
This is another jihan move, possibly his final move before we check mate him with the BIP148. My intuition tells me that there will be a 'developed and proven safe' 2mb hard fork prior to UASF activation. 
If he pitches in on the MASF, the community would certainly consider a 2mb hard fork after the MASF.

I've never seen "average user" even defined, so what exactly do you want me to consider?

I believe ~1.7 mb is the upper limit with segwit. Would this not provide for "the average user" by increasing the capacity for on chain transactions, *just like* what you're getting out of a 2mb hard fork, or does that 0.3 mb make all the difference to you?

Doing a 2mb increase on top of segwit just seems retarded to me. If a capacity increase is the goal, and segwit gives us a capacity increase, then why the fuck do they want to hard fork to increase capacity without seeing if it's even necessary after segwit? 
I think there is a hidden agenda, because obviously a capacity increase is not what they want. They keep bargaining and pushing for this hard fork like a creep bargains and pushes drinks on a girl to try and take advantage of her. "Why won't you have a drink? You said you wanted to have fun? Come onnnn, please? Just one, for me, it's my birthday. I'll buy, just have a drink, one drink, on me."

I commonly see valid criticisms of eth countered with the Tu Quoque fallacy, like appealing to hypocrisy with the 'centralization of hashing' in the bitcoin network, which is convincing enough to people who don't know a lot about cryptos and just gloss through threads, but really it's a bad comparison. I have yet to come up with an explanation of why I just can't get into eth, but I bet there is an explanation based in game theory.  The proof of stake system makes me not want to play the game at all. I don't fully understand why. 
When I learned about bitcoin I thought the game theory was brilliant, neutral, and something I really wanted to participate in. Maybe one day I'll come across someone who can convey their thoughts better than I can, who happens to share a similar criticism. I appreciate your comment, thanks.

Why would we want to compromise with people who have tried to discredit the core devs with conspiracy theories, prevent bitcoin from getting segwit, ran covert asicboost, put backdoors in their miners? At this point, I can't help but put a high degree of scrutiny on anything that Jihan or Ver support.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:21:27
So how did you determine the amount of extra room we desperately need to accommodate the 'average user'? Have you determined empirically that segwit + 2mb will allow the 'average user' the equal opportunity for on chain bitcoin transactions? I'm really interested in your figures, I'd still really like to know how you've determined a 'fair' transaction price for the 'average user.' I assume as far as the blocksize goes, you're not just guessing at a number larger than 1 but not so high that it would cause an audible gasp from a large % of bitcoiners when you suggest it, you know, nothing too high, but something that sounds reasonable to the non-thinkers. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:35:32

The way he keeps pushing for a hard fork is just weird. It's like one of those guys who wants to get a girl drunk so he can sleep with her, and he keeps insisting on her having a drink, and he just keeps bargaining and bargaining and his hidden motive so painfully obvious that it's cringy and creepy. 
It's even more worrisome considering the whole antbleed thing. It just seems like he *really wants a hard fork* for the opportunity to do something. I think that he is compromised, and bought by the chinese government. They probably made an offer of more than he could ever make in his life with bitmain, if he could help them out. 
This makes me wonder if the segwit + 2mb comrpomise is actually what they've wanted since the beginning. He keeps on insisting on the hard fork and offers us segwit, like a drink, in a creepy way. It just seems like a segwit + 2mb bitcoin would be the perfect opportunity for whoever is pulling the strings to split bitcoin.
Imagine they split bitcoin into 2 chains. The spam the segwit chain, and start pushing how the 2mb chain has lower fees. If you think the shilling is bad now, just wait. They hit the web hard shilling and shilling and shilling. They've got control of the exchanges in china, they offer both coins, they manipulate the 2mb chain up in value, pumping it with fiat that they can print endlessly. Then they switch, and start shilling that bitcoin has lost it's place as digital gold, because it doubled itself. Egh, what a fucking nightmare scenario.

Just a heads up: It didn't work the first time because the minimum mining difficulty was set to 8. I hit submit, and went back and it was still on core. I typed 128 into the minimum mining difficulty box and selected bip148 and hit submit, and that locked in. 
Edit: I'm sure this is a no brainer considering the red text, but I wanted to mention it because the steps outlined by slush are 1, 2, and 3, and you're set. These steps as outlined by slush did not include changing the minimum mining difficulty. Can someone let him know? Thanks.

In other words, would an AI with it's own programmable money be superior to the AI's we have today?

@_date: 2017-06-22 21:19:33
Ah ok, hm, yeah I have a theory about big block propaganda that it appeals directly to altruist sentiment, where people think "everyone should have a right to onchain transaction, even poor people," so it's easy to scoop those people up on the big block side. The problem being that long term, everyone loses out due to the centralization that will occur from big blocks due to the bandwith issue in regards to running a full node. In other words, to people who don't understand bitcoin, you can virtue signal with big blocks. It's much more of an immediate reward to virtue signal and not think about the long term affect, so for the non-thinking virtue signalers, big blocks are the shit.

@_date: 2017-06-22 00:39:58
Are you saying that because the on-chain transaction costs price out smaller purchases, that bitcoin is not cash? Where are you getting your definition of cash? 
the definitions of cash that I find are 
"money in coins or notes, as distinct from checks, money orders, or credit."
"money in any form, especially that which is immediately available."
Also interesting is the origin: late 16th century (denoting a box for money): from Old French casse or Italian cassa ‘box,’ from Latin capsa. 
**The qualification of bitcoin as peer to peer cash is independent of the cost of a transaction, and there doesn't appear to be a standard basis of goods and services that any given type of cash is required to be able to purchase in order to qualify as cash.**

Someone can always release a new crypto with a new feature that's better than the other coins (Presale starts tomorrow!). Bitcoin won't always be the first to have the newest best feature, you'd need a centralized coin for that (Or a coin with an insubstantial amount of use, and a small community), and with that centralization you lose the ability to mitigate counterparty risk, which is why decentralization is a huge selling point for bitcoin.
Edit: You could start a new bitcoin right now if you wanted. One with segwit, and schnorr signatures, and yadda yadda yadda. Once you reach a critical mass of users/nodes/hashing power, your new bitcoin won't be able to upgrade very quickly and by your logic, a new technically advanced crypto would arise due to the 'governance issues'. So it goes. The only way to mitigate that problem is centralization, with that you get counterparty risk.

Seriously, I know what you mean, I see this happening too. They might try a false flag, pretend some millionaire lost a bunch of bitcoin during the soft fork (Or lose some on purpose for the same affect), if the core devs included bip148 in bitcoin core it would be easier to point the finger at them, if WE do bip148 then there's no one to point the finger at, or something along those lines.

"To the extent that current segwit disables asicboost, or not, that remains unchanged and unmodified."
So is he saying that to the extent that jgarzik's proposition disables asicboost, or does not disable asicboost, remains unchanged and unmodified? That just sounds like he's saying "to the extent that it may or may not, that remains unchanged," so it still may or may not. 
edit: also is 'current segwit' explicitly and clearly defined? Or could he be talking about any current version of segwit?

Provided we eventually enable segwit and fix the issue, I'm not too worried about it. Remember 28.8k modems?

I personally do not have any evidence to support OP's claim, but that doesn't make OP wrong. I would assume that someone with an agenda to pump alts at the expence of bitcoin, while peddling shitty alternative bitcoin clients and spreading lies and conspiracies theories to discredit our bad ass core devs, *may* want to keep their alt pumping agenda hidden. You know, so that way they can, uhh keep doing it. As an added bonus they can claim there is no evidence of their shenanigans, and then play the victim of 'baseless accusations' to garner sympathy.
I'll admit, I have no evidence, but lately the circumstances and my intuition have lead me to believe that OP is right.

@_date: 2017-06-03 23:19:05
That seems like a great idea, but I don't think litecoin is a good analog because there is so much less economic activity with litecoin. Imagine if dogecoin had segwit, do you think dogecoin would be a good analog to bitcoin in terms of how segwit is working? I don't think so, mainly because it's not used for economic activity nearly as much as bitcoin, but also because the exciting 2nd layer applications aren't going to be implemented on coins without substantial economic activity. In fact, I think developers would prefer to work on the coin that is used the most and has the highest market cap.

It has been incredible to watch this all go down. The level of this psychological attack is highly sophisticated, I feel like I've learned a lot about the art of subversion. I even think that they've been using the price of eth as leverage. I'm just speculating and have no evidence to prove it, but my intuition tells me that bitcoin is under attack by something much bigger than Jihan. I don't think we'll ever truly know exactly what has been going on, and why. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:11:48
Yeah I'm not sure how all that works. I assume the cost of the resource needed to accommodate huge spikes in traffic like they've been having must be very expensive, if the spikes are irregular statistical outliars, then they wouldn't want to overcompensate and spend too much on that resource during the mean time. 
I think maybe it's servers? If they buy too many (or rent too many) then they loose money. Then on the other hand, if they wait until a spike in traffic to rent more, and there is latency getting those servers up and going, then you have the same issue. So it seems like the problem is that you either over compensate with servers, or you deal with the shit down times and hope people don't leave, until you can afford to run more servers all the time. This is just speculation, I really have no clue what I'm talking about, I'm literally talking out of my ass like I know something, admittedly, so I'm sorry if any of you really know about this stuff and I've made you cringe and/or facepalm.
Nonetheless, they have not gotten the balance down quite yet, but I am confident based on my previous experience with them, that they will soon.

I appreciate the comment about this potential attack, I didn't even know that was a possibility.
I was playing blackjack in vegas a few years ago, and there was this lady at our table who I believe shared a similar quality with Jihan, one that we all need to be very weary about. This woman never cheered like the rest of us, or even cracked a smile when the dealer busted and everyone won, but she did get extremely giddy when she won and *everyone else lost.* She laughed and smiled, and said "I won and everyone else lost." 
I have a good sense when it comes to people, and Jihan seems like the kind of person who would act like that at a blackjack table. I think so many of us here think people act in a rationally self interested way, thus, he wouldn't do anything to harm bitcoin because that's what his business is all about. Jihan has already made a lot of money, and I can tell that Jihan would not give 2 shits if bitcoin were harmed by his actions, in fact, he would get personal satisfaction and joy watching us lose money. "I won and everyone else lost."

They leveraged fear (Altcoins are going to win if we don't fix this!), appealed to authority (Satoshi's vision), and were amazingly able to demonize the *core devs* (well to some people at least) by using the genetic fallacy (Banks are evil and want control, AXA helped fund blockstream, blockstream pays the core devs, therefore the core devs are evil and want control). Demonizing the core devs was the most amazing feat IMO, because they essentially got us to bite the hand that feeds.
Then they sock puppetted to make grass roots support for BU look way higher than it really was. They completely painted this sub with negativity, tried in every way to make things as contentious as possible. I remember when it started they were trying to get a whole trump/political comparison going, it didn't get much traction, but I think the purpose was to garner support from some a certain sample of the population of bitcoin users. Seeing how contrived and out of touch it was made me even more suspicious of chinese state involvement. 
I feel like I've learned a lot about psychological attacks, and the art of subversion by watching this all go down. Of course this is all theoretical, don't know if any of it's actually true, but I think it's worth considering given the fact that state actors know they can't attack bitcoin head on, they can't beat it, they'd have to subvert and divide, they know that a contentious hard fork is the only real viable way to kill bitcoin, and I know they know that :)

You can help out by running a BIP148 node and contacting your exchange. Since you agree that segwit is a good start Hop on board the UASF train, WEW LAD! We can assess the need for an increase of X mb afterwards no problem.

Noted, I'll make sure not to mention his name for the rest of the articles I archive and post. I just figured that since nobody likes him, that they might be more enticed to click the article version that doesn't pay him.

Do you think he would answer me? I'm just some dude, I feel like I'd be lucky if he even dodged my question with a vague answer.

Does anyone interpret what they read?
'Should reduce the chance,' not 'will eliminate the chance.'

20% of the miner fees of each transaction go directly to poor people through us bro, the rest would be decentralized renewable energy proof of virtue based blockchain internet of things, all we need to do is launch our ICO, together we can get ri..change the world!

I heard they're moving the blockchain over to mongodb, it lowers fees and increases the rich statefullness viscosity index.

Why would it need an additional measure if segwit already blocks asicboost? That seems weirdly redundant, kinda like how needing another capacity increase on top of the increase segwit already offers seems redundant.

I think they still want to accept it. They just have a huuuge disconnect between customer service and who ever is in charge of bitcoin implementation. 
I ordered a monitor from them, paid in bitcoin, and it turned out they didn't actually have them in stock. I got the email notification, and called the customer service dept (obviously somewhere in India) and they had no idea WTF was going on, they kept asking for the credit card I paid with, and didn't know what credit card bitcoin was. 
Went up the chain of command, and even the supervisor's supervisor did not know WTF was going on. They wound up having to send me a check. 
So I think until they can fix that disconnect, and be able to implement bitcoin refunds (I think bitpay makes it easy now), then bitcoin is out for dell. WHATEVS DELL, I'll just spend my bitcoin elsewhere until you get your shit together (I still love you, you make the best laptops IMO, please fix this)

"The wait time for network confirmations recommended for securing bitcoin payments is the biggest issue for retail stores when accepting bitcoin, according to Felica. Asking customers to wait in the store for multiple network confirmations has long been a problem for Bitcoin merchant acceptance. The company, therefore, uses a centralized system to confirm all transaction before broadcasting them. The end result is a centralized payment layer on top of a decentralized settlement system, which offers Felica users an instant payment in bitcoin."
