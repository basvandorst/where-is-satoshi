The arbitrage profits between bitthumb and other exchanges is all the proof I need to see the SKoreans are unaffected by this blatant fud.

He doesn't do a good job of explaining different wallets for different cryptocurrencies.

You're right, Ron Paul still sounds skeptical, as I would hope anyone would be if they don't understand crypto-currencies. Its sad that we are praising a healthy amount of skepticism but that's the world we live in.

I jumped on Bitcoin early but didn't have much money but still made a tidy sum over the years. I diversified into litecoin because of the sha256/scrypt difference, that was successful as well. I jumped on doge, believe it or not, because putting the face of a popular and growing meme is another stab at doing something different than what bitcoin does. I knew full well lots of btc and ltc people had a disdain for doge, but that gave it some validity in my mind. 
Its not a pure scam like Qrk, but that doesn't mean it will continue to succeed. Listening to the people who overinvest into one thing is never the way to make a buck, anyway. No surprise, really.

I know this isn't the Litecoin reddit but because Btc was accepted by a major company(tiger) that sells scrypt mining equipment, the value of LTC is going down especially in relation to BTC. Veteran LTC miners transfer their mined LTC into BTC so they can buy from tigerdirect, but the speculators who use LTC's price to predict where BTC is going have sold out into FIAT.

stop preording things that the company selling them has a strong incentive to delay your order until you can't make a profit

The chain of events that transpired before this is actually a blessing in disguise. The previous bad news from China caused markets to burst and re-inflate when the news turned out to be a non-issue for the most part. The news is actually dreadful this time, and in the back of everybody's minds is the knowledge that the value can and probably will go back up because it was able to before.

Whether the answers they get are unsatisfying or not does not make them less true. This is why Keynesians are so grandiose when they talk about their ideals, but have to make excuses when they fail in reality. 
They like satisfying ideas, or answers in this case, but the sane people in the world put that idea aside and gravitate towards satisfying results.

Free market means competition. If there weren't other cryptos I would be very, very concerned.
