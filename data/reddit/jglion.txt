Why do people assume that the market will react that way? Bitfinex will likely dissolve, its people will go in a million different directions, it'll all be corporate bankruptcy and the founders will create new companies that will pay them money.  
Losing customers isn't cheap but it also likely has nothing to do with whether the principals in bitfinex get paid or make a living.   So what exactly would the market do to correct it?  Unless people are getting offed for making this kind of mistake, the same people will continue on to other companies and they may or may not learn

Microsoft IPO'd in 1986 and remained pretty solid and stable with minor movement until they released Windows 95, at which time they started a modest growth pattern.  During that growth pattern they did not really fluctuate too heavily.
No, volitility was not present in microsoft and the market didn't need to "mature."  It was a very well valued stock in relation to it's company and has been all along.
 has the chart where you can see this.
Apple IPO'd in 1981 and also reacted in the similar manner.  It only became volitile around the post 9/11 recession and various key moments in the company's history (introduction of the Iphone, death of steve jobs, etc)
This person seems to be making shit up.

The whole point of a public ledger is that coins and transactions are fully tracked and vetted by multiple confirmations.  The best you are going to get is that people may not be able to tie an address to you personally, but you'll never get FULL anonymity.  (I define full anonymity here similar to cash or gold transactions, where you can purchase something in the dead of night and there's nothing tying you to the currency used or the sale itself)
