Laws aren't always right.

I use the one hundred trillion dollar bill as a bookmark. I loved it even more when I was reading "End the Fed".

I emailed them a few months ago about it with a long and detailed email about *why* they should accept BTC.
They sent an email back saying they'd thought about it but decided not to.

Theft is the price for civilized society? That doesn't sound very civilized to me.

To be fair though, she seemed to be nodding at nearly everything. She was also live tweeting the entire time so that can affect attention span. But if this is the case, that's a bit worrying.

I'm in an airport and everyone is probably wondering why I'm doing the same.

If I took money out of your next paycheck against your will and gave you or "society" something in return you'd be okay with that? Let me know if you are because I'd be happy to set this arrangement up.

Please, stop.

Avoiding taxes and then being forced to use a monopolized service that is provided through theft is not theft.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:55:41
I believe so.

Yeah that's the problem. Everyone upvotes the trash. I do what I can with my downvotes though.

That's why I said I'd provide you something in return. As in a good or a service.

It's often those who are so deeply embedded into an industry who can't think outside the box. You're challenging the status quo and their small minds can't grasp that.

Stop promoting governments who steal from me.

Again, it's provided regardless of whether or not you agree to it. Taxation is collected *against your will*. It doesn't matter if a good or service is provided in return. If the means to the end is against your will it's wrong.
Roads, police, firemen, etc., could all be provided peacefully through voluntary interaction just like any other service. There's no need for theft (taxes) to provide these services. And considering the fact that I'm an anarchist, I fully advocate this.

Stefan Molyneux. Sorry, should have specified.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:34:38
Cool story, bro. As Molyneux once said, "Somalia—what an anarchic paradise! Because, when a State collapses, that’s exactly the same as people understanding why. You know, like if a bunch of churches fall down you immediately get a philosophical understanding of atheism."

His real name is John Galt.
