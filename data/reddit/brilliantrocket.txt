How many of them aren't instantly converting their Bitcoin to USD? The number of businesses that actually keep their Bitcoin and use it to transact would be a far more meaningful metric by which to measure Bitcoin's success. If it's only ever used as an intermediary through which businesses can accept USD, then it isn't really functioning as a currency.

Don't want us to rock the boat? Too bad. Dark is going to be pushed into the mainstream, whether you like it or not. Another thing for you to keep in mind is that regulation will be all or nothing. They won't ban one coin they don't like, but rather all of them ( if they do at all). So if Dark goes down, we're taking you with us. Every time you disparage Darkcoin by associating it with criminal activities, you work to undermine the foundation that Bitcoin stands on. Just food for thought.

That's probably because the alternatives are where Bitcoin was in 2010, in terms of development. Also because most people haven't heard of these alternatives.

If it fills a need that Bitcoin isn't filling, it'll get users. Getting them won't be hard, they'll come straight from Bitcoin! It really is that simple. Also, the hard part isn't done, cryptonote coins still have a ways to go in terms of development.

Bitcoin isn't anonymous. Don't use some half baked solution in a attempt to make it anonymous. If you need anonymity, use one of the anonymous altcoins. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:15:43
Zerocash is really flawed. It can never be trustless, as there is a key that needs to be destroyed. If you use it, you have to trust that the developer destroyed that key. If the key were to be compromised, unlimited coins could be created and no one would know. Second, the project under which Zerocoin was developed had funding from DARPA. You'd have to be a moron to use it.
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:36:18
Cryptonote coins have anonymity built into the protocol. The fact that there's currently little usage is a temporary problem.  
@_date: 2014-05-03 18:26:44
Why support a centralized solution? It was a good effort, but I would never trust it for real anonymity.

@_date: 2015-05-10 18:02:53
Bitcoin has a transparent blockchain. When someone wants to conduct transactions anonymously, they won't be using Bitcoin. I don't see why so many from the Bitcoin community get defensive over this.

@_date: 2015-01-31 04:35:13
Mining is the most important aspect of Bitcoin, considering miners are the ones who secure the network. If a bad actor gets control of enough hashpower, they can undermine the integrity of the blockchain, and thus damage confidence in Bitcoin. With that in mind, how do you figure that mining centralization is not a serious problem? 
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:53:22
I can link you to the cryptographic proof which shows that ring signatures are indeed anonymous, if that's what you're looking for. 
Eventually, software will make tracing Bitcoin transactions automatic and trivial. We're already seeing exchanges using the blockchain to track their users, resulting in various undesirable consequences for those being tracked. 
Recommended methods? Ain't nobody got time for that. The solution needs to be a default condition of the currency, not a series of procedures that one needs to follow. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:02:32
Don't think so. I doubt that Bitcoin can scale to credit card transaction volumes. Plus the fact that it's insanely centralized and will only continue to become more centralized. If a cryptocurrency takes over the world, it will be something we haven't heard of yet.

My statement was that a deflationary currency can't work, not that every inflationary currency will succeed. Note that periods of economic depression are marked by either deflation or hyperinflation. An ideal currency would inflate in line with economic growth.

The risk of those coins being spent is priced in to some extent, but to such a minor extent that it's nearly irrelevant. The price of Bitcoin is not driven by paranoia over whether Satoshi's coins will or will not be spent. 
Indeed you can have long term upward pressure with an inflationary currency. Not everyone is a speculator.  Most people don't care about minutiae like a reasonable level of inflation, only that they can use the currency for spending. A currency structured to be a deflationary speculation token will remain just that. 
An inflationary currency can grow in value if the economy that it encompasses grows faster than the rate of emission. You're coming at this from the perspective of "What features are most likely to increase the value of my tokens?", but that perspective is not ideal for growing an economy. The proper perspective is "What features reduce the friction of obtaining and spending the currency?". Gains derived from a growing economy will vastly outpace gains derived from attracting speculators. 
As an aside, could you please point me to anyone who thinks the best way to grow an economy is to reduce the likelihood of people spending their currency? 
@_date: 2016-11-14 20:22:55
You don't need to know. If the coins are lost, the effective supply is reduced. Market value is a function of supply and demand. If there are fewer coins to meet demand, the price increases.

Investors (read: speculators) are cancer. So yes, I do think a coin with no incentive for speculation would be good. I'm interested in a payment network, not an investment product (Ponzi scheme). I don't think there's any value in enriching a bunch of speculators. If anything, it's harmful. What I'd really like is a solution that prevents any significant wealth gain by early adopters.

Growth will continue for the foreseeable future. Not a realistic problem to worry about. In any case, our world is only temporarily finite. I doubt we'll remain on this planet forever. 
A currency that perpetually gains value loses the essential qualities of a currency. It can only gain value temporarily, before eventually collapsing. It's a game of musical chairs. Smart people invest in areas that generate real value. Dumb people try to chase a delusion.
The inflationary model does have a future, as evidenced by the fact that all  successful currencies are inflationary.

If they start to move, and only then. Deflationary currencies can also be priced downward, as deflation is anathema to money. Money derives utility from being a useful medium of exchange, and if it isn't being spent, its utility declines.

It's the velocity of money that determines inflation, not supply. Imagine the US government printed a trillion dollars worth of currency and stashed it in a warehouse, never to be touched. Would the value of the dollar decline? No. 
The supply of a currency means almost nothing. What determines value is the supply that is in active circulation.
