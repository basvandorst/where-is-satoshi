It would be good PR if they could share more information on the issues and mitigation tactics they might be following (what are they turning off for instance). When things hit this point (over 30 minutes to just login, can't see any account info after though), they need to reveal a bit more than they usually do if they want to buy some good faith.
Happily been with them since 2013* but if this isn't solved in the near future (or greatly mitigated by turning sections of the site off - if that even helps at this point), it's hard to remain a customer.
*_and wish I knew them back in 2011, as I wanted to get in to cryptocurrencies then but most exchanges inspired very little confidence in terms of handling payment details, and Kraken was the first I felt relatively "safe" (as much as you could when using a fairly new service)_

They seem to have posted an update on the situation, let's hope everything goes well.

Agree. They ought to have come clean earlier and maybe perhaps even stop accepting new customers and suspending some markets (expediting withdrawal requests for affected currencies/assets) or secondary functionality.
For instance, Bittrex is currently not accepting any new customers (yesterday their sign up was 404'ing and today is redirecting to an help page explaining it).

So, and please bear with me, what would be the economic repercussions if we were to have the technical ability to mine and bring back to Earth gold from asteroids or another planet, within the next 100 years?

Is it also Tax Free in Portugal? Because if not, that's just yet another image propagating the ignorant belief that the Iberian Peninsula is just Spain, which it isn't.
