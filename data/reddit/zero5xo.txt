I agree with what you're saying entirely, but you can  look at Bitcoin right now as a *beta* for the real thing which will include being able to spend stuff in stores or online when vendors see it as a viable option while building other layers/side chains (lightning/omnilayer/RSK) on the Bitcoin network to give it more utility besides being a decentralised settlement network. A lot of people will ignorantly scream "FUD!", but you're kinda right. Especially when you look around online on discussions around Bitcoin, a lot more people are starting to admit they don't a shit about the decentralisation and the revolution but only want to make $ profits. Long term this project should go to the moon since fiat currency is a problem that needs something to keep it in check, but I hate to admit that Peter Schiff (who's still clueless about Bitcoin's potential ��) actually has a small point about Bitcoin just being a big bubble right now since people are literally saying they just want a profit and are not the libertarians we think they are. If you're in it for the long run just do your due diligence on it every now and then and chill, if not ride the alt pumps and cash out real quick before the fear/greed spectrum shifts for the worst.

Imo to eliminate the speculators.  Without a healthy correction more  people will just join the quick profit bandwagon and forget the point of Bitcoin. Acceptance of Bitcoin at vendors and trying to run a node is more important than the price of a Bitcoin.

Nope. You're worried if you bought Bitcoin to make a dollar profit, but if you see potential in the monetary revolution then you wouldn't care about the price right now. If you need the profit then sell, if not just don't look at the price until 2018

If you really want to make serious money trading you'll probably have to compromise and sign your details on an exchange I'm afraid. By the way why not just ask how to invest anonymously without stating it's $200'000? No offense or anything but saying that openly on Reddit doesn't suggest you're the type of person wanting to keep your wealth private.

Advice? Run a node, and support any Bitcoin vendors. In the grand scheme that'll do much more for Bitcoin than wondering how many $$$ you can make :-) Central banks need something to keep them in check, and this could be it

Imo new markets will take their place, then when the market starts booming again they'll return but with a much less significant position of influence than before. If they're really exiting, they lose out bigtime.

You're pretty spot on with your analysis. Most people are just speculating with it right now. But to be fair Bitcoin is more like digital Gold right now rather than a easily spendable currency as it's quite slow and clunky to transact while being very scarce. When the lightning network is deployed (which will allow lower fee micro payments and help Bitcoin scale for wider use) it'll become spendable. However if a lot of vendors still don't accept it or people refuse to spend it after the lightning network implementation, then it'll probably always just be treated as a "stock" to speculate on.

If this Chinese situation acts as a catalyst for this, then I wouldn't even mind if all the exchanges in China get banned to force people to adapt and evolve.

Thank you, blows my mind that people care about these people's opinions. Bitcoin brings the heat to them.

Lol hopefully. But at the very least Bitcoins need to scare central bankers and world governments enough to not use reckless monetary policies that pretty much kill currencies and people's wealth across the world. I'm not even American but have noticed that the $ index has fallen 10% from the highs this year, meaning every dollar buys less everyday. If Bitcoin becomes a spendable world currency people Central banks won't be able to mess with our money any more. And at that point expect to be very wealthy from just owning one Bitcoin.
But honestly that's just my sight on it, just do what you need to do to be fine and hope it all works out.

Occasionally a few hiccups but as a whole quite good. I buy for UK websites so I don't know about other countries but customer support is great. Literally got a email response within an hour so no complaints there, just wish they had more retailers.
