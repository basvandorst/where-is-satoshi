Is this from 2014? I wonder if I can still do this in 2017.

But the rate that coins will be minted is lower, isn't it? The rate is the same but the comoutational power has increased a lot, so the competition is tougher now. Or else?

There is a big influx of people right now so it will take some time, maybe more than a week. I use bank transfer. I don't feel that comfortable using credit card

I lost 0.1 ETH transfering from bitstamp to bitfinex cause I thought that smartcontract was the standard. I submitted a ticket but no response yet.  For me, banking system has been really robust and if anything happens, you call the call center. But when it comes to crypto, i have to raise my awareness a lot when I make transactions.

I am extremely curious  how did they hack into these exchanges if it's not internal affair or at least some sorf of secret cooperation.

I guess what he is trying to say is that insider trading has nothing to do with price whereas what you're describing is price manipulation. In insider trading, they use information that is not publicly known to give an edge to them. 
For example, suppose you are an accountant working in a big corporate and you get your hands on the upcoming finiancial report that will be published in a week. You notice that there is a 30% boost in revenue and earning so you contact your friend or relative to buy the company's stocks and hold it until the information is released and the stock price will rise. 
In this sense, insider trading doesn't rely on price cause it can be done at any price and still gain profits.
Personally, I agree with your idea about price manipulation and I think that this happens almost in every market. In stock markets, at least, when the fish come in, the price will change even if they don't intend to do so. What I've heard and I believe is true is that market manioulation is real and the degree of which it's applied is dependent on the market cap. And they don't usually do this alone. Big selling or buying can change the technical patterns and lure in technical traders to behave in a way that they predict.

Dunno whether you actually don't know. But NVDA is Nvdia stock ticker name

But these companies survived the crash whereas many others failed. I am holding both of them right now.

I can imagine these coins using blockchain. However, for mickeycoin, why do people want to trade it? I don't really see why all of the altcoins have to have floating market price instead of fixed price by the company. If I were to go to Disney park, I would like to know exactly how much I have to spend buying mickeycoin.
