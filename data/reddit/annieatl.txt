That moment when you get downvoted on Reddit simply for admitting you're a woman...

Thank you! As a woman who holds BTC among other cryptocurrencies, I definitely was irked by this meme. Your explanation is pretty spot-on. By itself, the meme is not offensive, but combined with all the "boys club" comments in this sub, it's just another example of that shit. Like when that guy posted about "recruiting" 7 women onto the "bitcoin train" and there were comments like "now there's twice as many women who know about Bitcoin" etc. that really bothered me. I bring up cryptocurrencies to people in small talk, just to put some feelers out (and hopefully help a few people make some smart investments). I've broached the topic with probably a couple dozen men, several in technology and finance fields, and not a single one knew anything about it other than simply having heard of bitcoin before. But instead of concluding that men just aren't smart enough to understand the importance of Blockchain technology, my conclusion is that most people of both genders (or however many there are nowadays) just haven't learned about it. So yeah, it's not the meme by itself, it's the overt sexism characteristic of any STEM community. If I posted a gender-swapped meme, I'm sure there would be plenty of comments about the "irony" that the wife holds bitcoin and doesn't think the husband can understand it. But hey, I don't let it get to me, I don't mind pushing a guy into cognitive dissonance when I explain Ethereum to him. I'll enjoy wrecking their preconceived notions while I still can. Eventually those who can't embrace the idea that women are just as capable of understanding Blockchain technology will find a happy home at r/incels.
