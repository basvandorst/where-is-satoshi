So you can point that fuckin finger up your ass!

I can't believe that this is a real word. Nice.

Depends on how you qualify the term "engineer" imho. There are heaps of machine operators, construction workers, IT monkeys and even plumbers who claim that title, but that's not exactly what I call an engineer. A broad definition of the term for me would be the capability to design some sort of system from first principles if necessary. I'm Manx and about to finish my Masters in EE, and am hoping to find employment on the island. Literature I've received suggests that the number of "real" engineers on the entire island numbers in the tens, and it's a dead-mans-boots sort of game. Luckily they're mostly old as fuck so fingers crossed. ;)
I realise this thread is also old as fuck btw, but just wanted to put it out there. Also the work-permit system here strongly discourages immigration, so any engineer-y types thinking this is some kind of mecca for them is probably going to be disappointed.

This is such a warped way of viewing the world. I honestly pity anyone with that mindset.

Lol damn what an idiot. Unless it's an elaborate meta-troll effort.

I don't think he posted it. He hosted a video chat and it was apparently sitting about somewhere in the fore/background.

Kinda wish OP had waited for suggestions before going ahead with this. In its current state it's never getting found.

I love how dwarves and south Koreans occupy the same level of potential reality (if not level of altitude) in your mind.

I'd say one SAS guy tbh. I doubt anyone in Liberland could stand against a highly trained soldier. You'd need 2 to occupy it for awhile, since even SAS badasses have to sleeping.

I actually usually see it non capitalised, ie 3.5m, but either is acceptable I guess.

So did you or not? If not why not? If so what was the upshot?

Sorry for the noob question, just saw this on so I'm not familiar with Bitcoin, but how would a company like Microsoft deal with the volatility of Bitcoin which was in the news recently? So let's say you add £10 worth of Bitcoin to your account and buy something with it, and then the value of Bitcoin drops sharply overnight. Haven't Microsoft just lost a fair percentage of money? Are they just 'gambling' (or speculating I guess) that in future Bitcoin will be a much more stable prospect so their stockpile of Bitcoins will eventually be vindicated in the long run?

Hehe. I only started using faucets a couple of days ago and after a quick calculation after using land of bitcoin where you get given about 25 different faucets, I worked out that the 2500 satoshis I'd earned in about half an hour worked out to around 2 cents. So I knew straight away that it wasn't exactly a worthy endeavour, unless the value of Bitcoin increases a thousand-fold at some point! But the worst part of it is that you have to keep doing it to meet the minimum payout value of either coinbox or the individual websites. So now I'm stuck doing it until I can at least generate my payout. At a rough guess-timate, I'd say this will take me about 2 weeks, and no doubt I'll earn something similar to you by the end of it. What's it work out to? About a dollar? 2 weeks of the most boring work on earth to generate a dollar. Fucking mugs game. Makes me wonder if everyone using those faucets are just noobs that realise swiftly, or whether some people continually use them and have just never stopped to figure out the futility of it.

Tbh I'd hardly call mirror writing "creative". To me it reeks of attention seeking. If you have something creative to offer you don't offer it in a form that's incomprehensible to the consumer. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:22:51
So this is completely wrong then?

Star Colonies is decent, not as much going on as MOO but still fun. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:01:13
Problem with that is that you have to work solidly at it for ages just to meet the minimum payout requirements of these sites, which is generally about 10,000 satoshis -- which represents visiting that website perhaps 100 times (and 100 satoshi is a generous rate!) over the course of a couple of weeks, or a week maybe if you literally have no life. In reality faucets are ad-cash generators for the webmasters, and little else.
Best way for noobs to get BTC is to use that intro website that generates a wallet and gives you a few hundred satoshi to play about with. All else is bollocks really, unless we see a hundred-fold increase in value.

Apple have done this with many applications and/or innovations over the years. It's surprising to me that anyone's surprised they're now doing it with bitcoin. Unless Apple has the already overwhelmingly popular app or software device under their direct control, they won't allow the possibility of third party innovation in their ecosystem.

I guess Japanese-Americans have given up on the correct pronunciation and just go with how everyone around them pronounces it.

I have to admit I'm sceptical too. Given the abuse OP took in the last thread, all of a sudden his actions get some form of validation from the people affected. How convenient. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:43:23
Honestly, that was a pretty awesome explanation. I know it can be simplified down to the "ID" metaphor the other guy used, but it's nice to know how it actually works computationally.

I personally dislike the whole idea of Latin writing on it full-stop. It's just such a tired trope to use this dead language as a slogan/motto for something in order to make it look more authentic. Bitcoin is a modern currency that's unfettered by the standard restraints of existing monetary policy, so why burden it with clunky old Latin buzzwords like it's some kind of 17th century institution? I much prefer the binary version, or even plain old English if you really feel the need to express some kind of slogan on there.
