Coinpayments.net is quite good and has an instant POS calculator to convert fiat to crypto. They’re based in Canada and have quite a good reputation. That’s what I use in both e-commerce and physical venue in the Philippines. Their fee is reasonable and they offer a lot of altcoins as well (Bitcoin fees make it quite expensive to use right now).

Please sell then, make it go up again! 
Seriously: lmao. If you’re in for the long time, just forget your coins for a while. 
People make no sense: they say we are early adopters, then panic when a part of this tiny fraction of the global population sell and crash the price. Think about the future, when billions of people will use crypto. This technology is here to stay. And for all the people panicking: if you believe in that technology, you should just relax and forget about your coins price for a while. For like 2-3 years. Only then you’ll see if your bet on the future was right (if yes, happy lambo ; if not, at least you had the balls to stand for something you believed in).

You’re right. But how do you do it when 1) you have employees receiving the payments in the physical venues and 2) online payments that must be created, received and confirmed automatically? Using a 3rd party seems like an easy way to solve the problems that each situation involve.
If you’re working alone in your shop and create and process yourself the payments, of course you don’t need anything else then your wallet and your knowledge. When you work with several employees who may not even know what bitcoin is exactly, you cannot take the risk of asking them to do something complicated (with high risk of errors, time-consuming and logistically complex for security reasons), you choose the solution that will simplify everybody’s task while accomplishing the goal (accelerating adoption). Same thing with the online payments: if you’re not a programmer, you won’t be able to implement your own code to generate, accept and confirm payments directly to your wallet.
So no, it’s not a total non-sense to use intermediaries who greatly facilitate receiving bitcoin/altcoin payments. They provide the tech that business owners don’t have the skills or resources to create themselves. If you know of better solutions, maybe you should let them know instead of taking your business away from them. It would be more helpful for the whole community.

That’s the right answer.

More BTC lost to nowhere? Or you keep a backup and will claim it if no one take them before next year’s Halloween?

That’s for today. Wait for tomorrow.

What does he mean by « eating his dick »? Maybe he just means « sucking his own dick ». And he’s practicing for it with a special hammock.

Lucky you! Now is much better time to invest (in every scenario - except if all goes to zero).

Make a video and post it to YouTube. This could launch a movement. Just need a good hashtag...  (or something better...)

Good you don’t have a reason to smile then.
