Basics:

Then it'd never come back, it'd be hodled instead..
@_date: 2019-03-31 12:35:21
Murphy's law compromised... :o
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:40:18
And what does Satoshi's Law say? XD
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:24:27
Dunno.. I can imagine for some it might actually be seen as more trustworthy or smth
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:13:32
Well it's always nice to go shopping around Christmas, right?

If you didn't care, you wouldn't post these few comments when people already told you how very not interested they are in what you achieved so far, because.... You are mean ;)
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:25:04
Well you take it too personally, no reason to worry about people's reactions, you do you... :)
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:01:27
Fiat is dangerous
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:31:05
Sure, why not?

You can get it on a tshirt from redbubble xD
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:37:59
Imo, Bitcoin being quasi private is ok. There are cryptos that are private by default, everything has its usecase. 
Also, for many, trackability is very important and a reason for why they chose bitcoin.

First things first, you never know what the new high will be and whether the current price is the new low or not. Look at the charts and listen to your heart, bro... Just never overinvest, keep it at the "money I can afford to lose" level, wait the dip and get in. :p
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:28:27
Oh! Good to know, i was about to get some of their stuff... :D
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:24:07
As banano is a meme coin... Have some for a nice content xD
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:12:41
It will go up to billion, but I'll still wait until it drops to 4k again so I can buy low. 
And now seriously. It is worth a lot, but it depends on what point of time you are interested into. If you're looking for getrichquickyohoo scheme, I'm afraid you might be 2 years late. I'm sure the price will have some fun around 2140 when the last mined bitcoin will come to somebody's address, so hodl it for your grandchildren may not be that bad of an idea :p

This is a very rare kind of comment on this sub.

Aka Betteridge's law 
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:50:09
Nice try xD
@_date: 2019-06-08 06:20:00
Isn't it exactly why we all love it so much? XD this market is a jerk and it's hilarious!
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:48:32
Can't find an untroll button on this troll... 
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:26:35
Sounds like it is time to run my own... :)
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:02:36
Looks like minecraft, but good luck!
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:58:21
Got some programming skills and deep networking + cloud knowledge. Also, I can make tasty pizzas
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:37:16
And now you don't, I guess? Haha
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:45:26
Welcome on the good side of computing, sir! 
I guess, sooner or later will see ya at hehe 
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:56:47
Let's develop one, then... �� 
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:50:23
Uhm... I'm sorry...? ◔ ⌣ ◔
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:07:50
We're in the same train, Sir! 
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:26:20


It's a great piece of advice!
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:04:51
Cool stuff! GL!
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:11:59
Yupp. It's already interesting... The dynamics with which prices change for parts few weeks... It's just barely getting any attention. I think that as soon as it catches more eyes, the charts are going to scratch the sky. Or ground, depending on the whales' plans :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:58:03
It must've been looking like a great deal back then... XD there are people who sold tons of btc for pennies thinking it was a great opportunity and great profit... XD
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:59:52
This one is Binance mobile app :)
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:19:33
And its all delivered to you by a Polish KSW... Remember when Litecoin partnered with UFC last year? 
Cryptos are going mainstream now, honey!
@_date: 2019-05-02 04:43:15
Hahah no idea, but definitely worth trying!
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:00:58
Haha, so there's still time before it starts feeling like November 2017!
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:28:31
Hahah I first need to hop back on Bitcoins, did sell for some usd profit, I'm greedy xD
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:24:42
Maaan it's so cool!! Is your work somehow related to crypto or did somebody just "paint me this on the wall"ed it?
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:31:07
I once sold my all fiat holdings when they lost 10% to dollar... ^jk
@_date: 2019-05-02 04:33:12
Well said. 
The only thing I'm afraid of is that in the end he will try to runaway from the consequences with gender change announcement....
