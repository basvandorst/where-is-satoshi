A lot of wallets and exchanges are gonna implement segwit in 2018!
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:19:26
Start with a coinbase account and go from there. If your limit is 1000, then put 1000, and choose bank wire, as it is cheaper than credit card, but you will have to wait a couple of days before you can buy anything.  
Coinbase Is very trustworthy, so don’t worry.

Then please tell me what the price is gonna be, Jan 1. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:47:19
There is gonna be a lot of talking, about bitcoin in the dinner table, like there was at thanksgiving. So it will probably affect the price positively, like it did at thanksgiving.

They forgot to multiply it with 2.5
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:21:10
You can also get a mobile wallet like bread wallet, where you can buy directly from the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:35:11
