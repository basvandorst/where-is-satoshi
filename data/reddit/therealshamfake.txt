Can't believe I saw this coming and bought BTC priced at $6,700. Small buy but still happy with it!

Your loss lady! You had the chance, you wasted it.

Congratz man! I'm still too dug in so it's only a little lighter

I understand what you mean. However, I feel that governments of the world are getting too comfortable and forgetting that they are serving the people, not their pockets. Time and time, they need a little reminder. 
In any case, it's the internet. Getting heated up over the internet discussion only hurts you more than it hurts the other party :)

Probably more than once but you know what I mean��

Seems like every 'Legal' and 'Financial' institutions are warning us. What're they trying to say?

I was being sarcastic. Take it with a pinch of salt and chill dude.

if that is his train of thought, tell him to never invest. It's a danger to him and his loved ones.

That's the whole point! Imagine him putting in a thousand dollars? How much of it would he blame on everything else? How much of it he'll make you pay back?
Don't put him, yourself and everyone in harms way. Just let him live till he's ready to start investing. Always make it clear to him that investing would mean a chance for him to lose everything. Only when he can accept that, should he start investing.

Whole point of crypto is to screw over the financial institutions and the government...
