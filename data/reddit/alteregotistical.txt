It's good to put your money into something stable. Bitcoin isn't stable and won't be for a looong time. Even gold is less stable than stocks and bonds, and gold has been around forever! Get a mix of stocks, bonds, gold, cash, and bitcoin. You achieve stability by diversifying across asset classes.

Good God, know when to just let it go.

[Indian demonetization]( and [Venezuelan hyperinflation](
Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, wants to phase out cash so that more Indians' commerce can be captured and taxed. Some really high percentage of Indians are supposed to pay taxes but don't because they use cash for everything. So now large bills are suddenly "demonetized" and made practically worthless. The process is causing so much turmoil, and Bitcoin is so ready for prime time, that people are turning to it fast. Thus, even *more* commerce is taken off the books, and the policy will end up being counterproductive. So pitiful.
I don't know much about Venezuela, but inflation is out of control there.

Oh, it's a bitcoin market "built on Wall Street"... that's exactly what I've been missing in this whole bitcoin experience... Wall Street.

That was surprisingly entertaining.
