Quadrigacx offers PayPal withdrawal.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:20:11
No it won't. With that much $$$ you could just buy all the coins and kill bitcoin. It's not big enough for wealthy people to care about.
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:16:30
Look at dogecoin for an accelerated halvening schedule. They ended up merge mining to keep alive after the halvenings ended.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:53:50
Yeah. But it's nice to see someone come to their senses and realize they are wrong. I'm glad we had this discussion so you could realize how silly you sound. Good for you.

I know it's his money.  He wants to buy the bitcoin throne.  I am voicing my opinion on a free open forum about a supposedly decentralized currency.  I'm not interested in buying a vote.  Buying power is pretty much against everything decentralization stands for.

Lol. You want a new regime because you think the current one is corrupt but you won't let the community decide who is in charge. How does that help decentralization?

Your fees are really high.  VOS charged $2.50 per interac deposit.  You charge 10x that amount: $25.  Will that ever change?  
edit: VOS had a minimum interac buy of $10, yours is $100.  Will that change ever too?

Will it really be a better store of value if the price is so volatile?  It hasn't really stored it's value so well thus far.  You can't count on the price being the same by the time 6 confirmations happen.  But I can count on my fiat to be worth relatively the same value when I wake up and when I go to sleep.  I like bitcoin, but I don't think that it's a better store of value than fiat, and I don't think that is changing with the next halvening.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:35:32

The beauty of open source is that anyone can fork the software and develop it.

You cannot send less than 1 Satoshi in bitcoin, but you can send less of that value with dogecoin. This isn't about your opinion on the merits of alts, this is about your claim that the author was ignorant, and so far, you are failing to backup your claim. Have a nice day.

how to make a screen shot... in ubuntu?
@_date: 2015-10-06 00:24:15
Meh.  They can just use google wallet.  They already send me microtransactions for doing surveys.  No lightning network, sidechains, increased blocksize, or debate needed.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:45:41
They just had an ad that said whales were welcome. What gives?
@_date: 2015-10-10 13:52:39
You sound like and it makes me afraid of bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:34:45
You're a dirty liar.
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:58:31
The only reason dogecoin is alive is because of merged mining. This won't help the fact that a fee market can't support mining given current figures.

Did you recently have daylight savings?

If you don't trust her/him with her own private key, you should seriously reconsider trusting her/him with your child. If they are too irresponsible to keep a number written down, they should not be responsible for your child.

Try contacting circle. We aren't customer support here

What if bitcoin took off it's pants and waved them around over its head.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:54:49
Thanks. Fun seeing you here too. That's what's fun about reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:43:01
So is dogecoin. But it's worth a lot less, so you can play with smaller values than possible with bitcoin. What was the ignorant part?
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:30:51
I don't know. I haven't used it since they changed. I'm just some dude.
@_date: 2015-10-15 10:42:08
Most exchanges have an api. Just code it in python.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:44:14
Is dark a wallet available for normal people or just beta users?  Can I use it without Tor or VPN?  Is there an android app for it?
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:40:22
These are the people from coinforcoffee.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:54:00
You do good work. This is my second T-shirt from you and they are definitely my highest quality t-shirts. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:04:42
How does that stop invasion of privacy?
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:08:18
How can you do this?
@_date: 2015-10-02 03:09:55
It will come online when they finish developing ConnectU.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:10:28
They can track you by your phone in the store by triangulating your signal  with WiFi access points.... If it's on. Then they can correlate the time, and location with your purchase. Cash or not, they have the info. Even if it's incorrect sometimes, from a business perspective it's okay as long as it works to increase profit sometimes.
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:22:30
Nothing. If you look at dogecoin as an accelerated test, you'll see there was no big pump at the last halving. Everyone expected it, but nothing came. Past performance does not predict future performance.

Don't listen to random strangers on the internet with regards to how you should spend your money.  Or just give it to me and save yourself some time.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:27:09
What about the whole monitoring spending and changing the terms by which people can access their money part of the post?
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:04:01
I had no idea they were so tiny.

If people are getting 0 money for their email currently, they will net more than that if they use this service.
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:04:42
Can you deliver people? Like a stripper? For science of course.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:22:52
They'll be chopping off fingers and pulling out eyes in no time.

@_date: 2015-03-05 12:45:13
That is what the word fee means. It's okay for business to charge for their services. That's how people make money and buy food.
@_date: 2015-10-15 10:55:43
Nowhere to spend their allowance. Thanks mom &amp; dad.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:58:04
Have you tried customer support? Sounds like it's just you.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:49:07
And pay capital gains tax on all her candy bars. Sweet.

Will coinbase open in Canada?

Read up son 
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:56:20
LOL.  Why would I ever buy paycoin?  It's a scam that is under investigation by SEC.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:51:21
The dogecar said dogecoin on it.  This doesn't say bitcoin.  It says bitpay.  It's nice, but it's not a bitcoin car.  Unless you use bitpay, it's not really a welcome to NASCAR for the bitcoin community.  It's really just a paid ad for one company.
