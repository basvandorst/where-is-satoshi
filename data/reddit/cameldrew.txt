Also making me uncomfortable. I want to take profit off the top so badly, but keep telling myself to hold it. Im probably hyper-developing a makeshift schizophrenia right now.

Dude holy shit what. I had seem this 'feature' like everyone else but had no idea this could be done. I'm a sucker for tickers.

You buy one (I recommend Trezor but there are a few others very well known), initialize it, and send all of your BTC to it. Now only you have access to your BTC.

The sheer volume of people in here who clearly have next to zero understanding of Bitcoin or even fundamentals of Blockchain tech and yet are spewing tons of bullshit about a ban, lack of exchange diversification, BTC value as a currency, etc, is absolutely staggering.
Think hard before taking anything you read in this subreddit as fact, because right now it's painfully clear how many users here are very, very new to this space.

I use Whaleclub. Its got the best UI I've seen on any exchange or platform so far, and a very active chat with well educated regulars. People shit talk it but I've been using it for months and experienced no issues, aside from some annoying lag when opening the app on my phone. Desktop version is 100% solid IMO.

Yeah trading view and whaleclub chatboxes are hilarious right now. Almost hit $5,900 on WC.

Goldman can suck my Sach with this shit.

This is somewhat unnervingly accurate as it also applies to the current price drop so closely.

This is gold.

Right now it looks like we may be hitting $1776 by lunchtime.
EDIT: We passed 1776 before I even had time to post this!

Photoshop props for a little actual effort.

I could watch the entire movie like this. Best crypto meme of this style I've seen. I dunno why but the SEC in the foxnest manning the machine gun killed me.
