The private sector can provide all these services you list more efficiently and inexpensively than the public.

No but WE answer to them. They are the regulator.

Legislation will only get coopted by corporate interests.

I have long believed that we will never achieve real freedom until we have decentralized internet, meaning without servers that can get manipulated and controlled by states and corporations. 
That would probably require much smaller, lighter, and higher capacity hard drives, but also decentralized power generation. As long as there is any kind of centralized 'off' switch, either a way to tap unto or 'kill' the internet AND the power necessary to run the internet, we will not have control over our own lives. 
I think the latest term is 'mesh networking'.

That's just the thing...I think everyone should be responsible for protecting their own stockpiles of value. As soon as you outsource that to any central entity, you start a monopoly.
In a world with less hoarding, less passive income, everyone will have to work harder to make a living. That means faster and more useful innovation.

Banks are VERY regulated. Currencies too. Hence THE CENTRAL BANK.
