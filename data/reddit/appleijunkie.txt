Well, I started seeing activity on my account earlier this morning and I've received credit for this transaction (for now). I waited around for an hour before selling and transferring my full balance. I'll know in about an hour on the transfer and Tuesday on the sell to my bank account. 
Still not one response from CB customer service on the whys though, which isn't a bad thing since I'm getting my money back finally but it sure would be nice to hear some kind of explanation. I emailed Customer Service after their non-response last week and then I sent a nice long message to Brian Armstrong via his blog asking for some mediation...even gave him my personal contact info and offered to talk about it over a phone call. 
Anyways, I'll be sure to post all responses I get (if any) and updates if something goes south with the transfers. 
Thanks again!

I transferred everything from my Blockchain wallet to Coinbase. Coinbase tells me I have a zero balance after the smoke settled, that my account "had more problems then others" related to that block problem, and all of my BTC should be accounted for. But, when I check sites like Block Explorer, I see a balance or 9.64 still unspent for my Coinbase address - see here  .

I only have 2 addresses in my blockchain wallet, both of which are referenced in that same TX I linked above. Do I need to see what Blockchain has to say about it?

0 BTC. During the time CB was fixing the problems related to that bad block, there were times that 9.63 BTC showed up in my transaction history and other times it didn't. It doesn't now.

Well, I apologize and I'm sorry you feel that way. I've been going back and forth with CB for a month now and they've been less than helpful with this even after admitting my account had way more problems than what they saw with others. I'm cool with any explanation, but I need better proof from them other than my balance is correct because it certainly isn't. I should have ~24 BTC reflected in my BC account and I only have ~15. The 9.63 in question is no where to be found and that's why I'm coming to you guys for an unbiased opinion on what happened. This is $250 of my money that's missing...not something I'm willing to just give up on.

Sorry for the whiny title...that's my opinion on the situation. The more I'm digging into it and PMing with folks here, Coinbase seems to definitely be at fault. I have no clue what kind of recourse is available to me at this point though.

What does that mean...a change address in my wallet? Basically, I sent 9.63 to my address @ Coinbase - the address ending in qamf - and it's no where to be found. 
*edit - So I did some research on what Change is. Seems straight forward as long as my assumption is correct - I should've received 9.63 back to my original sending address...correct? I didn't.

Here's my transaction export that actually showed the 9.63 BTC for a while (this was removed and added back a few times while Coinbase was "fixing" their issues. I was even able to successfully start a transfer, but it was cancelled. Note that none of that appears anywhere, it's just missing like it never happened. 
Here's my current transaction export:

Ya, it was in February. Reason for no transactions since is I'm not really trusting the BTC network right now ;). 
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:09:32
Ya, the TX I linked is FROM my blockchain wallet being SENT to Coinbase. My CB address is the address ending in qamf. That make sense?

Coinbase's story is much like what you started off saying. I sent 9.64, received 9.63 back as change. I've done everything from sending them transaction details from blockchain.info and block explorer to sending them those transaction exports. The CEO, Brian Armstrong, is very insistant my balance is correct and is sticking to the change explanation every time. 
What's the best piece of evidence I have here? My "smoking gun"?

Just to give an update, I emailed support the other day and received a reply. They didn't even read the email, and instead sent me a generic email related to some other problems this week. Man this is frustrating...

I've given up on the idea of transferring to my bank account for short term trades. I'm using CampBX right now and treating it as a savings account...I'll transfer out using Dwolla when I need it, which takes only 2-3 days vs. 3-5 with Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-03-18 16:17:00
I'll see what happens. Thanks for all of your help...glad to know I'm not going crazy :).

Zipmark &gt; BitInstant &gt; CampBX Deposit address. Faster and negligible fee cost compared to Dwolla in my mind.
