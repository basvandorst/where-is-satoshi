Want to Win?
START CONFIRMING

Value of the Coin: 
1 Coin = 1 Pizza
Then (maybe) people will start to ask: "how much is a coin worth?"
That one depends on YOU. YOU decide/change the price of the pizza (in alt-coins). = Depending on what you want.
 (in other words: YOU decide how much one coin is worth. Just get people starting to using you ALT-Coin).
"JUST WRITE THAT ONE COIN IS WORTH 2 DOLLARS)"
Whatever you want
*Another Edit: Create a company - put it into the stock-market. GO GET IT

I guess, after 3 days of no confimation is what you should concentrate on. 
Start to confirm I would say. Help others so they don't have to wait for 3 days like you did. Maybe some people want faster confirmations - maybe others want to wait even longer. Edit: Do whatever you want.
I tried to mine with my computer but it didn't seem to start - the mining software. (From what I remember it was something about some .dll file or files missing.)
Well, my objective was to confirm without trying to solve a block.
Because, from what I understand right now - if you start to confirm you will get "nodes/strings" for the next and upcoming blocks. 
From what I understand right now - the confirmations works like validation. When you confirm other transactions/blocks you will get "validated" by the blockchain/people who mine. You helped people get what the wanted (confirmed transactons/helped them solve blocks). 
From what I get, right now, is that you will get validated by validatin others. I think (right now) that that's how the  blockchain works.

Probably not verified/confirmed by other people who mines bitcoin. Just wait for it.

Let's say it's me.
Do you want to ask something?
