You had me at Lambos covered in spikes.

We will not take crap from Charles Entertainment Cheese.

I like iOS devices for phone and tablet usage.  Not a huge fan of MacOS.

Straight-up horrible, gonna be tough to forget that.  How could you do this to yourself??!  Over fucking Internet money??

Yes this happens with other commodities as well.  If gold goes down to $1,000 and it costs $1,200 to mine, then miners will shut down gold mines until they become profitable again.  The margins for beer are much less tight than BTC or metal mining however.

Very interesting, it appears that Trinidad and Tobago is 100% natural gas and has government electricity subsidies.

My guess is that the site is running Drupal, and was compromised in the last month or so in the "Drupalgeddon 2" fiasco.  I have seen a lot of Drupal sites with injected coinhive scripts recently.

I would never put my own money into diamonds because they are not particularly rare, and their price is controlled by a cartel.  That said, diamonds have been used to transport wealth discretely for years, far more compact than gold.

As do I.

What about silver?   No element on earth is more reflective, or conducts electricity or heat better than silver.

Well that escalated quickly.

Until lightening network is fully realized, I don't see merchants adopting BTC, at least not for inexpensive items.  During periods of high activity, I don't relish the thought of paying $3 in transaction fees to buy a $3 coffee.

Thank you, I'm glad there are watchers of the wall.

So should we start using cans of food as currency?   What about ammunition, you can't eat it, but it could be used to protect your food cans?

By design, there can be only 21 million Bitcoins .  Governments can print an infinite amount of currency.

I'm going to order 11 different toppings and simply eat them in a bowl, no pizza.

Good on ya!  Hope you see $10K and beyond soon.

I predicted a bottom of $3,300 earlier this year, we only saw BTC drop to the high $5K range so far.  Not sure we're gonna see BTC go below $5K in 2018.  Could easily see $11K or so on the upside.  Who knows, humans are bad at predicting the future in general.
