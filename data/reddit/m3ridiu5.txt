Wow look at those buys
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:07:38
Keep a copy of your wallet address
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:40
Lol, i’m Wondering what Monday will be like.  The CBOE may have an impact on the value as well.  Just don’t know what yet
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:51:42
I saw a lot of sells come through.... then it was flooded with buys.... DAMN
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:29
it's about to break that wall
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:06
Don’t you deposit from your debit into your USD wallet?  This takes 3-5 business days.  Then once it’s in your wallet you can make an instant purchase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:35
Use gdax.  And learn to use limit buys
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:49
Holy crap, sell walls are dropping faster than a (fill in the blank)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:04:59
has the transaction completed?  Is it in your open orders?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:53:49
yea, that's all I see.  It's like 50/1 buys/sells
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:09:54
I actually don’t think bitcoin will win the race in the long run.  It’s the front runner now, but there is another one I have my eye one.  I’m about to invest in it
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:53:12
holy crap, watch it go!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:12
What about ripple?  Their Blockchain logic has been picked up by Apple, android, and Amex 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:59
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:03
I have to think most of these sales are peeps getting scared.  I just saw a TON of sales on grad go through.  I bought at 14,500, a few days ago.  Not worried
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:43:25
Wow it’s dropping.  I wonder if some people are selling out of fear
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:30:08
What caused the surge in price over the past week?  Was it just a ton of new buyers and not many sellers?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:47:24
I didn’t.  I still have mine from September 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:40
You think that’s the bottom???
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:34:42
lol, you're welcome
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:54
And the wall is gone
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:30:29
Looking strong today
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:32:50
There’s a big buy wall at 13,500.  Don’t think it will drop past that until that wall is cleared 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:10:56
That’s a pretty cool gift
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:55
Saw it dip back to 15.5k before gdax went down
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:35:26
Nice.  I have to go back and look to see how low it dipped
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:34
Coincidence maybe.... it’s in an upward trend as of 6 EST
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:30:19
It’s been 30 min.  Can’t call anything normal
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:20
I’ll google IOTA.  Is that available on any exchange yet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:06
Over 16k
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:01:59
17K in a matter of minutes, just watch
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:09
Almost 1k up so far
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:52:50
I agree with you, this is just a correction to the price jump a few days ago.  Overall it will continue a the climb
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:01
Can someone explain this one to me....?
Bitcoin will be available on CBOE Monday for bitcoin futures.  And on nasdaq early next year.  What does this mean?  Bitcoin won’t be available for trading on those markets, right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:37
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:34:16
It means that 220 bitcoins are wanting to be bought at that price.  Made up of a ton of buy orders 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:19:51
That sux dude, sorry.  I just made my first purchase a week ago.  I hade to go through that 3-5 business hold... felt like torture.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:46:20
Do you think bitcoin will be the  crypto over the next 5 years?  I’m not asking what else your investing in, just if you think bitcoin will be the overall champ in 5 years.
I’m invested in bitcoin, but I have my eye on 2 others, about to invest in them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:07
You’d Be buying because of your belief that it will continue to grow.  True, you won’t make as much $$ as from the early investors but if you believe bitcoin is still growing, then you already answered your own question
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:32:33
Who bought during yesterday’s dip?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:21:36
Wow, didn’t notice.  It’s up about 50% over the past few days
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:19:53
wow a lot of buys just came in
