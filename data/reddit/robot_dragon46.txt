People are selling it to others that had BTC or USD on the site (post hack). So long as the 36% haircut gave them 100% reserves or more then its fine.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:56:45
which alt? ethereum?
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:19:49
I sold my tokens right away. I wasn't interested in hodling exchange tokens. If the hack never happened, and those tokens were introduced as a cryptocurrency, it is something that never would have fit my risk profile or been an investment that interested me.

Not if you were buying on margin. Plenty of opportunity for margin calls.

You waited a whole month?

Use Bitfinex. Just get ready to have the exchange hacked and lose most of your money.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:40:09
Whats wrong with transacting with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:24:57
Its a bad assumption really. Bitfinex is the top volume exchange right now, the trades are in USD. Bitfinex is an exchange located in Hong Kong. There is no reason to assume that just because it is Bitfinex that it is US buying.

They have repurchased 97% of those tokens?
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:03:42
Actually not really. They only are part of the sub when the price is rising rapidly.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:20:32
What a strange first post.
@_date: 2017-01-16 05:38:42
Why wouldnt you just torrent it instead then?
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:24:16
Yes I think that people should be required to pay taxes, and if they don't they should be "forced" to go to court to defend their case.
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:44:44
Sure I have read several libertarian books, such as the Road to Serfdom. I feel pretty aware of their arguments and what they want. I definitely do not agree with them, but I at least think I understand them.
@_date: 2017-01-30 18:36:37
Both IBM and Microsoft have blockchain projects under development. So I don't see how the argument you made really applies.
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:04:03


2008 was caused by the loosening of lending standards and regulations. Loosening regulations is very much a libertarian minded thing to do.
And yes, before you or maybe another poster, starts ranting about interest rate policy. Yes every respectful economist knows that Greenspan severely mishandled interest rate policy. But that was not the cause of the crisis, it did however make the crisis worse.

General inflation is not all about the money supply. Prices of goods and services is what measures inflation. Not a single variable. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:47:21
I would actually disagree with your premise that it is the "core" of libertarianism. I would argue that libertarian's core principal is autonomy.
I don't know what force means in this context, so I really have no way of knowing whether I do or do not agree.
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:56:20
I am not. You should go to jail if you don't pay your taxes.
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:14:59
Looking solely at the money supply is simplistic and wrong. That is looking at supply without considering demand. Inflation is not based on a single variable.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:18:37
Same thing that happened to Al Capone.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:40:44
Inflation is a function of both supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:19:37
Loosening regulations and gravitating towards laisez faire economic policy is very much considered libertarian. I don't think anyone would argue that the Bush years were a libertarian utopia, but yes loosening regulations is something libertarians advocate.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:57:02
Whats with the repost from 1.5 years ago?

If you are on the recieving end of a transaction and don't want to be able to be charged back by a credit card, then yes that is a very clear benefit over the traditional financial system.
But not necessarily comparing apples to apples. If the other side of the transaction were to give cash, then I would see no reason not to accept cash over bitcoin.

What newcomers are you talking to?
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:32:57
I was thinking the same thing. Every time the price goes up, there is some post about newcomers. Has the user growth rate somehow increased over the past few weeks?
Edit: nope

I know facts aren't popular here sometimes, but Bitcoin's money supply inflates quite rapidly at the moment compared to fiat currencies like the USD.
in 2014 btc added about 12.1% to the coin supply. Compare this to about 6% added to US M2 Money Stock.
Its really going to be out in around 2017+ that Bitcoin will have less supply inflation than the dollar.

You just described exactly how a normal deposit to Bitfinex works. You send your coins to an address (b58 encoded public key hash) that Bitfinex owns. Where does a piece of paper and off chain transacting occur like you stated above?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:48:08
Where do you put it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:13:24


You start by saying he would give them a paper wallet - not something view-able on the network (ie not making a transaction, just dumping his private key and giving it to bitfinex).


Then you accuse people of not knowing what they are talking about because what you said above makes little to no sense. Here, you change from a privkeydump to a transaction that occurs on the network... (Bitfinex generates a deposit address for Ver).


Then you get confused thinking Ver sent directly to the cold wallet, which did not happen. He sent to a fresh deposit address at Bitfinex, as is fairly standard procedure for deposits.


Now what you are saying is about how Bitfinex handles their deposits and whether they would be trying to manipulate markets by not following their standard procedure. Every comment in the past you were talking about either a privkeydump or about how Ver handled the transaction.
Either you don't know how to communicate or you don't really make "many bitcoin transactions". I am guessing it is a mixture of the two.
Have a good day sir.

It did go to a new and unused address.

Same here. I have ordered about 8 things from Amazon through purse.io in the last two weeks. I have been using purse instant buy because its the fastest and most reliable.

According to markets... yes.
@_date: 2016-10-05 15:42:11
    adjective: fringe
    1.
    not part of the mainstream; unconventional, peripheral, or extreme.
Austrian economics is a fringe economic school of thought. It is not mainstream. There are few universities that have Austrian econ programs, and only a small percentage of economists that consider themselves Austrian.
When calling someone a neoclassical (well at least in the economics department where I attended) it typically never meant a neoclassical microeconomist specifically, usually I have heard the phrase used to describe someone that ascribes to the neoclassical-synthesis (neoclassical micro with Keynesian macro). 
Also your quote is a bit cherry picked. It is from Veblen in the early 1900's.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2016-10-05 18:15:59
Its actually what saved the economy.
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:17:59
Thats pretty great.
The point I was making however, is that you seemed to be confused by Gross' understanding of economics when in fact his opinion is fairly well within the mainstream paradigm. 
I think a lot of self taught internet Austrian followers don't have a firm grasp on what the mainstream is. I think often times Austrian people think in black and white, ie Keynesian vs Austrian... hence your comment about how can gross be supporting both. In reality econ is much different than that. If anything, the battle would be much more accurately described as being between salt water and fresh water.
Anyways, try to read up. Or even check out if you are interested in alternative economic schools of thought (Austrian being one).
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:19:35
That is not why interest rates are low. They are low in order to fight off deflationary pressure. Fiscal expansion would also help fight off deflationary pressure.

I don't think that seeing value in gold or bitcoin makes you Austrian... not sure why you think that. I don't really see any indication that he is sympathetic to Austrian econ.
@_date: 2015-11-08 13:17:17
Poloniex is legit, but they don't have real USD pairs.
@_date: 2016-10-05 12:05:40
Yes I have a degree in economics from a school that focuses on teaching many different paradigms. Very familiar with Austrian economics.
I would venture a guess that Gross is more of a typical neoclassical rather than sympathizer to fringe schools of thought such as Austrian econ or branches of Keynesian such as post-keynesian.
I guess the point I am getting at is that it is strange that someone would consider fairly typical neoclassical opinion as "half austrian".
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:10:14
Why not just wait 2 weeks and buy some bitcoin then? Wait for the volatility to calm down, and the speculation to mitigate a bit.

That is what i was thinking. Buy low sell high is a great business model last time I checked. Same goes with sell high buy low.
