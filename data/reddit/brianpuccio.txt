You don't pay Visa, you pay the issuing bank when your credit card bill comes in. So OP wants his bank to accept bit coins for purchases made in his local currency (e.g., USD).
OP, I'll open up a bill pay service, I'll write a check to cover whatever bills you get (credit card, cell phone, ISP, etc) just like many banks offer but rather than auto debit your checking for the amount like your bank does, I'll just wait for you to send me the bit coins at MtGox + 1%.

Any potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed.
It's why so many tech sites say "hey, Logitech just sent us this new keyboard to review" or "Nikon has lent us one of their latest lenses, the ..." or similar things.
Here's another example, I'm browsing Yelp and I see that a local place has a bunch of new reviews, all of them glowing. Would it be useful to disclose that the owner of the restaurant not only paid for their meals, but also gave them some money to pay for their gas? Certainly.

Interesting story, thanks for sharing.


Neither is the dollar, it's a *Federal* Reserve note.
If by state they meant any sort of nation-state, that still doesn't matter. Take for example the Swiss Franc:


Money isn't (and hasn't) always been straight forward, nor have financial systems been set in stone (though stone was used to make coins!), they've always been changing and in flux.


Neither is the bodega on the corner where I withdrew $100 from the ATM.


They won't take Euros either, does that make it any less real?


My checking account isn't a "traditional investment account" (which I'd define as some sort of tax-advantaged IRA, Roth or otherwise, including 401k's and 403b's) either so that shouldn't matter.


On 1/1/1999, the Euro wasn't a traditional anything. In fact, there was no physical currency. But it was and is just as real.

People "day trade" forex which is 24/7 and is a better analogy.
What MtGox lacks that every forex has is leverage. Say you have $1000. You want to go long on USD/JPY. You have 50:1 leverage. You go half in, or $500 of your account. But really you get a $25000 position opened. If things go the way you want, say up 2% you profit $500, or double your money.
That's how you profit (or lose) big when trading currency pairs, leverage. MtGox lacks leverage.

In exchange for the ability to "make money with money", banks offer two primary things to customers:
First, they offer safety. Rather than stuff money in a mattress or on one's person where it can easily be stolen, banks offer safe keeping. And if the bank's safety measures fail, they are insured, guaranteeing customers that they can always withdraw what they've deposited. Whether or not you trust some company's ability to keep your bitcoins safer than you can, that's a determination you'll have to make.
Second, banks pay interest. Sure, now they're paying next to nothing, but it wasn't long ago that people would earn a decent interest rate on what they deposited into a savings account.
Third, banks offer other services (e.g., CDs, check cashing, loans, etc.).
Any bitcoin bank will need to offer at least the first two things I've mentioned before I'd even begin to consider letting someone keep my bitcoins for me. And they'd have to do it without fees.
Have I mentioned I love my local credit union? I'd be more interested in a bitcoin credit union.

I use them, free is great, but even neater for me is they do really cheap wildcard SSL certs. They're fantastic.

At the end of the day, two things that you need to face is that (1) local access trumps most electronic countermeasures and (2) rubber-hose cryptanalysis makes your encryption worthless. We just hope that when it comes down to it, neither of those things will matter.
If you store the key on the same machine where the wallet is, you have no security. Even if no one physically compromises it, any sort of exploit with your server that grants someone access to your wallet and the passphrase will sink you. It is recommended that you don't do this:

And if someone's account was accessed thanks to physical keylogger, malware, etc. by some guy using an IP halfway around the world from where you normally live, wouldn't that person be upset that basic protections weren't in place to detect that anomaly?
(I say this as someone who has had his credit card number compromised but never had a charge I had to dispute; the card network flagged the transaction and texted me, asking me if I was using my card in foo location instead of bar location because that sort of use is an anomaly.)
Second, if a government forces a company to do something, are you mad at the company for not breaking the law while not advocating your government for change?

Sounds like you've identified a need in a marketplace. Maybe you should try to fill this need and start a business.

The main difference between a bank and a credit union is who owns it, shareholders who try to profit from the customers (bank) or the customers themselves (credit union).

That's what so many say about bitcoin.
