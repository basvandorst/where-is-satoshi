Shaking out the weak hands, right?

This weekend has been frustrating, but I'm feeling optimistic. Let's see how I feel a week from now.

Gotta see how much we can buy with current buying power.

Yeah I'm worried it will go down to 8k, shake out the panicked small guys (admittedly scaring the hell out of me in the process), then either a) plummeting and drifting for a year (ugh), before skyrocketing again, or b) immediately shooting up to 16k (whew)

I love this sentiment, makes me want to go all in

Like myself! Ha ha ha

I bought a bunch when it crashed ~10% down (around $12k), hoping to buy the dip, but it never rebounded... boo. Caught a falling knife for my short-time trades.

You should reach out to him, ask him if his mind changed. Pretend to be a journalist interviewing the pretend journalist.

My trading timeline is both long and short. Long is making me very happy. Short is pissing me off.

At my rate of averaging in every paycheck, I'd be racking up the sats at 1k
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:42:24
Yeah, those are rookie numbers, I'm down... uh, a lot.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:03:07
Gotta stack those sats

Back then, the romanticized view was that natives were seen as savage, roaming, uncivilized enclaves spread out sparsely enough to be seen as an obstacle or a burden to overcome in the dream of "taming and settling" the west; our destiny. Us versus them. There was no "native american culture" perceived, only a backwards and uncivilized state that was pitied at best, hated at worst. It's a tragedy, absolutely, but it's also very predictable. Human nature gravitates towards dispacing or outright exterminating poor outsiders that happen to be in the way of what you want.

Doesn't that mean you should sell?

I loaded up my wallet with violent crime coins, none of those shitcoin white collar crime coins.

60% sure it is Nick Szabo, but I am still fascinated by the mystery
