It's working on my iPad. So rad... To the Moon!!!

That's actually a good question. I'd like to know the answer to this as well.
@_date: 2013-06-10 03:41:59
Nah. Just got a paycheck and deposited it today. I tried to deposit my payroll check at my primary checking - no issues in the past - and this message came up

Is ripple experiencing a ddos right now as well? I just got a 502 bad gateway
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:48:40
You are a genius and I am special... Thanks a ton... I was really freaked out there for a second

Look dude, the fact is, the majority of us average Americans use the big banks for our day to day transactions. I, for one, am sick of the restrictions imposed by our handlers. It would be awesome to use credit unions but its way easier to just pay the game and use Wells Fargo or b of a.

Hey fellow coiners - this is definitely a noobish question, but I'm not really sure what a ddos attack is and how it relates to lag and the current sell-off. Would anybody mind clarifying?

If its any help, I've used CampBx, via Dwolla, since January.  I haven't had any problems with them, and I much prefer their interface over the other exchanges. In regards to your question, any pending orders have easily been cancelled with the cancel order button on the far right of the pending orders screen.  I've cancelled several orders without problems, but ill take a look at it now just to verify. Hopefully this helps man.

Yeah thanks. I caught that before I uploaded the image but I thought it was too fucked up to gather any relevant data.

I thought the same thing myself. I scoured my transaction history of any indication of overdraft (I couldn't think of any overdrafts off the top of my head), and I have several investment accounts with the bank.  Which I guess is why I'm so pissed. 10 days to clear a payroll check? That's not only lame, its unfair. Bitcoin has dropped and I want to invest but I don't have access to my play funds because of some bullshit policy.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:37:21
Yeah I used this method as well. I love that the transfer from dwolla to CBX only cost a quarter. Way better than that 3.99% with bitinstant. Screw that noise.

I don't understand what you mean. Forgive, I'm relatively new to bitcoin (bought in in jan. and feb), but it seems to me I can make transactions using cash while avoiding the big banks.

Hey guys! Congrats on the milestone! I'm new to btc, actually just made my first purchase on mtgox today. One thing keeps troubling me though. I see all this speculation that the bitcoin economy could potentially oust traditional fiat currencies to become a truly global form of payment. But what happens when governments decide to make bitcoin acceptance illegal? I see a scenario where bitcoin is perceived as a threat to the US dollar or the euro and governments choose to simply ban merchants from accepting it as a form of payment. Thoughts?

I've actually been at my job for 3 plus years. I'm a paramedic and we don't have direct deposit. It's a huge issue right now. We actually just unionized and direct deposit is on the forefront of debate. It's shocking we don't have it already, I know, but that's the state of emergency medicine in Los Angeles 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:46:10
I think there's a ddos hitting several exchanges right now. Just the usual bs
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:38:04
Done. Let us know the results and good luck with your project.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:15:30
Coloreds don't work. Everybody knows that. Sorry, couldn't help myself. I hope I didn't really offend anyone
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:30:36
I'm in as well. Keep me in the loop.
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:27:58
You sound smart. Upvote!
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:31:08
Thanks man, that actually makes quite a bit of sense. Thats why i love reddit.  Its such a helpful, interesting community
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:30:52
Paramedic with a knack for sensing trends. Heard about TOR and the deep web about a year ago and realized BTC was the preferred currency funding illicit shit.  Pretty interesting stuff, I just kept following the cheese. Don't know shit about programming or cryptography, but I'm learning
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:34:23
It's happening to CampBx as well
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:22:16
BitCoin is my first real venture into the world of finance and I've learned a lot quickly. One thing I don't understand though, is what is meant by floors, and how to determine where they are. Would you line explaining in non-technical language? I'd really appreciate that
