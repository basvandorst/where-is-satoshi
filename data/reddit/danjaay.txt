I feel you but the guide is aimed at beginners, didn't want to make it too complex to someone new in the space :)
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:55:54
Harsh, what's wrong with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:14:36
Believe me you'll be selling on the first sign of a bear trend.
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:28:50
weird, that might have to d with the link shortener i used
@_date: 2018-09-01 14:45:37
Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:20:43
Fair point :D

No need to be aggressive,
ETFs don't hold bitcoin directly, the Bitcoin is actually held by a third party custodian which *could* rehypothecate the Bitcoin to another layer of third parties in the forms of derivatives and so on.
So what do you think about this situation?
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:38:44
Well... I bet most people won't go too deep into the rabbit hole so I can see custodians rehypothecating their bitcoin deposits in the form of derivatives just like your bank does your money in your bank account.

Gold derivatives are "paper" claims based on a physical asset&gt;&gt; gold.

Reef rekt.

It's down to the SEC in the USA, other countries could come up with ETF on their own though.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:39:49
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:24:11
Not literally selling it, more like leveraging it to create derivatives but yeah that's the idea.

I completely disagreed, she's doing a much better job than most imo
@_date: 2018-10-14 09:59:43
fair :D
@_date: 2018-10-08 08:07:42
I am also bored of pictures of giant descending triangles.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:14
Well, they're probably right not to invest now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:36:44
Time to take some profit!

Panic and Sell?
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:26:48
Next year maybe

Actual sentence:
The potential seems extraordinary for regulators.
...man crypto has changed.

His hostility for crypto really stood out for me, the rest of the panel seemed clueless, but not hostile.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:52:54
Back to March 2014 hopefully
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:20:21
Oh hi Mark,
A lot of people, particularly the ones new to crypto, seem to believe the Mt.Gox trustee is somehow single-handedly responsible for crashing the market... which seems like total bs to me. What is your view on that issue.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:58:34
Buy the red, not the green
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:20:13
Good news, finally...kind of... this could help tame Bitcoin's volatlity
