You often do that with passwords too. You get a hold of the password hash by intercepting the login request, maybe the session hash, then you brute force it offline.
The thing about brute forcing, though, is that it demands a whole lot of processing power and time, enough time for the session hash to be useless and perhaps the password hash too (I'm not sure, but I'm guessing secure systems frequently change their private key).
I thought everyone who makes login systems included a small timeout on 5 or so consecutive failed login attempts; hell, the beginner tutorial I read on making a basic login with python even had a timeout. To brute force it with a timeout in place you would need to try millions of combinations which could take years, if not decades to find the correct password.

Did you mean to say "paving the way"?

Oh wow! I've been using deluge for two years and haven't even considered that to be a possibility. A few questions though:
* Does the server handle the all connections and stuff, so you don't have to open ports for the client?
* Do the server cache the entire file, then send it to you, or does it send pieces as they're finished?
* When you choose download location, is that relative to your client or server? Example: If I choose to save it on my phone connected by USB to my client, will the data go web-&gt;server-&gt;client-&gt;phone without hassle?

For those of us running python 3:
    print("This is {0}".format(thing))

I also agree, but 99.7% (transaction fee).

Wait what? That's either a humongous coincidence, or the sign bearer made up the address ~~and it doesn't work~~.
Edit: Cool, I've learnt something today.
