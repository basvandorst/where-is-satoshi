That's great, thanks!

"oi" and "oin" don't make the same sound at all in french
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:46:01
Why is Electrum better than the rest?
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:52:06
yeah I got that, I honestly just want to see if my computer can even make 1 millionth of a bitcoin even if I can't send it to my account
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:56:49
I wanted to know what r/bitcoin say about it
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:06:17
This is so FUCKED!
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:32:00
That's what I thought, just want to test out if it will work. Does the unconfirmed reword update in real time on mining.bitcoin.cz? an any idea on how much I could make or where i could calculate the first 0.00000001 BTC I will make with 11 Mhash/s?
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:53:40
So basically you want a website where people propose BITCOIN related projects where people can vote for the ones they would be interested in?
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:20:44
Yeah let's not forget that it is a strong possibility, his username did intrigue me a bit with the fact that he has only been a redditor for less than 1h. For the mining part, I don't know dude, I know a guy who is 16 today and mined 2btc with not the greatest computer a while back.
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:24:55
ok thanks
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:51:36
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:30:46
I don't get it either, what's free about it?

@_date: 2014-06-28 16:28:38
I don't know where you heard that we think "The dog goes, "wa wa"" as far as I'm concerned, he goes "wouf, wouf". 
I feel so silly explaining this, I feel like I'm talking to a 3 year old... THE DOG DOESN'T GO WA WA, IT GOS WOUF WOUF!
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:28:28
Thanks for the great suggestions. Could Anyone give me simpler graphs as well plz
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:54:17
hmmm... 
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:53:02
^ ^
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:00:45
I'm very confused right now, what does this mean?
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:36:27
Good God! holy shit man thank you so much! I have had my wallet for about 2months but never really jumped in. I'm so glad you came along!
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:49:57
bitin.io looks more intuitive, Ill probably use that.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:05:41
What are the disadvantages? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:03:25
got it thanks, yeah I just opened the account while I was downloading the blockchain on my bitcoin qt wallet. I intend to erase the account when I get the money out of the mtgox account. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:34:27
No, the school was mostly rich jews where their dad barely cared and saw their kid.
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:43:34
What bills? Why would you pay bills in a hospital?
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:00:24
That's enjoyable!
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:26:45
Wow this is my lucky day! thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:26:44
good call
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:28:27
Thanks so much for the tip, any idea why I can't withdraw the bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:56:35
What the fuck is going on? Please someone explain simply.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:11:04
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:42:43
This makes sense. I just truted people saying that it's fine but know that I understand what happened I get it and I'm more reassured. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:46:44
It works now, thanks again man!
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:02:53
OMG thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:33:25
Any idea which one is better?
@_date: 2014-11-18 06:15:50
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:37:14
what are you talking about? I was 14 too not too long ago. Many 14 year olds couldn't give two shits about bitcoins and can't code. Keep in mind that the 14 year olds here are an elite.
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:32:53
I lived my whole life in Paris and have never heard anyone describe the dog sound as "wa wa" 
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:45:13
Electrum looks really good, how do they both differ? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:32:37
As I said, just for testing
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:46:13
whaaah... what?
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:59:16
lol so good, heard that one more than ounce, here is the rest of all bitcoins I own: 24.13 μBTC @_date: 2014-02-12 04:31:33
ok that's great thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:50:03
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:31:00
ok thanks
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:28:15
It's a great idea but it looks like shit
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:53:18
I think "digital" has worse connotations, it sounds geeky, a little unprofessional and less serious.
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:54:43
I fucking love jake and amir sadly they videos are very childish but can still enjoy watching some. I enjoy their "if i were you show" on soundcloud a LOT more. They mention bitcoins a couple times on there
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:21:57
Yes Bitcoinity is probably the simplest one, I'm looking for sources similar to this one, I know it doesn't get much simpler than it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:11:50
k, thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:15:16
The question is? I have qt now, should i go through the hassle of upgraded to core
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:40:07
I checked with the subreddit modand it's normal, he said it would be fixed in a few hours.
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:47:45
Happy Cake Day! 15 bits @_date: 2014-05-18 11:44:13
Just make a kickstarter kind website where all projects revolve around BITCOIN (projects like, bitcoin awareness campaigns, people making bitcoin software...). Obviously the projects would be able to be funded using Bitcoin. I know it's not exactly what you guys are looking for but I'm surprised it hasn't been done before.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:24:39
lol, mais tu sais pas de quoi tu parle
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:42:55
Thanks dude, That's my first ever bitcoin TIP!!!
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:03:19
Thanks! Really appreciate it as I am quite a poor in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:25:48
not "coi coi", no, it's "coin coin"
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:15:40
Thanks for the link?...
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:35:20
I'm VERY poor in BTC so this is very appreciated, Thank You!

Ah shit, just came back from Amsterdam!
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:52:37
That's great, let me know when it's up!
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:01:02
That's really funny, I came up with the exact same private key idea! I'm surprised this isn't a thing yet, I'm convinced it could really boost bitcoin if we had one such campaign!
@_date: 2015-11-25 08:26:02
I would rather see [CGP Grey]( make a video about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:33:43
Hey! can I get some? also, you should consider helping out @_date: 2016-07-17 16:19:35

Here is an example, this is the pokemon go server:
