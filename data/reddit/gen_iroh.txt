I wonder how that would be handled by the block chain...seems like you would need an intermediary to allocate funds because you wouldn't be allowed to transfer coins that you do not have.

someone correct me.  I've found that since transactions with Bitcoin take about 10 minutes to confirm,  retail stores and restaurants do not seem like great candidates for bitcoin.  I paid with Bitcoin at a restaurant recently,  and the guy didn't see any confirmation on his end for over 8 hours.  He was nice enough to let me leave even without knowing if I had paid him or not,  but i can't assume everybody will be that accepting.  Is this a valid criticism,  or an extenuating circumstance? 
EDIT: Seems like this is a problem with the coinbase mobile wallet.  However, this still seems like a Bitcoin limitation.  What makes a transaction "instant"?  It it because Blockchain is a reputable transaction database, so we trust that transactions handled there are the real deal?  Doesn't it still take around 10 minutes for the Bitcoin community to confirm blocks?  What would be the best way to address this idea with a merchant?

Here's something I've been thinking about.  Say a retail store accepts Bitcoin.   How do they handle returns?  Will they be expected to return in Bitcoin, or the equivalent amount in dollars at the time of purchase? Either way,  this is where it gets fishy because there is definitely a way to game the system.  Let's start with a Bitcoin refund: a clever dude realizes that if a store offers bitcoin refunds,  his receipt can essentially be seen as an asset.  I would be inclined to buy some regularly consumable product in bulk,  say,  contact lens solution.  If the value of Bitcoin stays steady or drops,  no problem,  I was going to use that contact lens solution anyway.  But if the value rises,  now I can return the items and make a profit at the expense of the store.   How about U.S. Dollar returns?  Its almost considered a short.  Buy the same consumable item in BTC,  wait for the price of bitcoin to drop,  return item,  buy more bitcoin with that extra money.  How does a store operate when it accepts 2 different currencies,  with one of them having large price fluctuations?

Thanks for the info!  I was a little discouraged about my first bitcoin transaction, but I'm gladI went through it so I know how to direct other people towards easier options.

YES!  Is that a known issue?  I went and got the Blockchain one after that little ditty, but still haven't tested it out at a merchant.

Yep, I agree.  You've also just reminded me of one of the big picture items that got me interested in cryptocurrencies in the first place: the crowd-funding aspect of it.  Tipping and donations are so easy!  I'll be sure to pay it forward, thanks!

How many people here have used a Bitcoin ATM?
