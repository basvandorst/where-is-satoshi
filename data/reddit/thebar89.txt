What is? The graph ? Graphs doesn’t matter on a boom don’t confuse a boom with a bubble. it could be either who knows . 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:45
Remind me of the people who take payday loan and go to casinos. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:18:22
Yeah but huge fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:30:54
Yeah but if will dip to 3000 everybody will sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:50:03
Yes. You bring it to your tax professional, when bitcoin it do your taxes. The exchange have your address and they obligated to report. 
Taxes on capital gain is when you sell, to USD. Take profits out of it. ONLY. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:03:52
You wait for ledger to support super btc or you use your btc seed to restore your super btc wallet.  But you need find a supportive wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:43:17
Because it will be big or it will be nothing in 10 years and no one knows. High risk investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:39
You need replace the wallet.dat file and then it will sync for hours and hopefully yours coins appear 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:57:04
Wtf this is great. Coinbase charge a lot to transfer to wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:29:37
No. Future can be bad for bitcoin if people short it and buy 1 btc for discount. . 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:18:41
Coinbase concert crypto to fiat. You we met talking about converting to alt which is between people so makes no sense it’s reportable 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:38:23
Yeah they been forked but no wallet has been released, no block chain yet. But then seem legit. BCX ,Super Bitcoin , bitcoin ultimate , bitcoin diamonds. The futures prices high but just speculation - till Wallet is out there’s no Blockchain or coins. Follow them on twitter see when they announce progresses. Bitcoin GOD is coming too bitcoin silver. Etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:27:07
You buy from coinbase and then transfer to private Wallet. No one keep coins in coinbase.  You report realized profits and then no issue with capital gain. If you never sell never tax. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:32:35
No because your coins are stored in the Blockchain not in the trezor. So no need to hide it. If you lose it you don’t lose your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:23:48
Yea I love it now
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:22
Please come back after it sync.

If someone use Gemini before and deposit via ach and the funds clear - how long till available from withdrawal in Gemini ? Should be immediately. It been very long. So asking for other people experience. I’m sure many here use Gemini for purchase. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:31:15
Got verified next day 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:22
It been a week. Cleared from my bank long ago .. they only let me withdraw 0.001 btc where I have 0.1. This is a ridiculous exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:38:32
Haha cool thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:10:32
Yea yea yea 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:01:45
The whole point of crypto is owning money annonimiously. Why bragging about it to your friends. Then you asking for it. You wouldn’t brag about have gold bars under your bed right ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:36:36
Shapeshift easiest
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:37:07
Try Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:08:22
Really? If dips to 3k is because everybody don’t want it and they selling. Then it can go to $2-3 again. Everything possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:49:27
You can’t afford to lose money which you don’t own. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:55:14
If btc is 6 million means no one uses USD anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:15:44
Gate.oi it seems. Also others shit coins forking tonight.  Bitcoin God. Also if you keep your funds in wallet you have the 12 key words for (seed) you can always extract your forked coins later. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:54:57
Can always recover. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:43:18
The Greek gov screwed everybody. Not only you. Go and withdraw cash and make sure convert it to usd before you fly out 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:09:47
Bitcoin doesn’t cost 1-2k to mine.

Get electrum wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:38:09
That’s why you don’t day trade. If you can’t handle these swings you will lose lots of money.

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:21:00
No one knows where it will be and not even 1% of population invest in it so even if it become 200,000 per coin many won’t be able to afford it by then. And most will sell it much before, like most of the original holders from 2010 already sold when it reaches few grands. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:02:24
Just have your 12 key word written down 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:45:59
Incorrect. You only pay tax when sell and exchange send you dollars to your bank. How you a cpa and dont know it’s unreslized profit till you sell for cash ? If you buy for 2k sell for 20k the 18k profit is realized profit, and you will get 1099. ONLY when sell to cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:44:13
But paper money hard to hide and easy to trace and tax. Bitcoin is the real cash !
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:01:28
Who will know you change crypto to crypto through shapeswift?   
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:56:44
I never would say if I knew I wasn’t 1000% right. I buy sell real estate , stocks, crypto - so I know what is capital gain. As long as you don’t cash out —don’t worry about getting anything from exchanges.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:02:36
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:51:25
If trade one coin to other even if profit this is not capital gain. It’s not taxable. Tax is on “real money” $$$ when you sell. I hope I made it clear enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:15:06

It doesn’t matter. If you get kidnap and you have 10,000 bitcoins you will send to whatever address they say. Even if hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:53:43
IRS dont care of incoming bitcoin, Just when you cash out. Exchange will report your sales. You can deduct the price the bitcoin cost you because tax is on capital gain. sale price - purchase price = cap gain 
Changing profit to diff coin no tax. Only when cashing out to cash exchange will report.  I hope I made it clear. You can also write off your loss if you sold in a loss (purchase price &gt; sale price )
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:38:13
As a currency. Mostly by criminals. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:38:25
If you use it for daily purchases 5-10 times a day you will spend $20-$50 on fees. So it’s not practical to use as digital currency. Just enjoy the pump hope developers figure out lightning network fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:42:22
When you sell you will get in the year end a 1099 tax form - from the exchange you sold it with. Till no sell no tax. If you buy a house with it - no tax. If use as a currency no tax. Only tax began sell.  Till you sell the profits aren’t “realized” so they not taxed. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:13:12
No ..transfer to a wallet where you have your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:04:59
Agents don’t hold the coins.  If you’re looking to buy a home with bitcoins in California and serious you can PM me.

Looks scammy
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:20:19
The coins aren’t stored from the ledger. Only accessible via the ledger. The coins store at the Blockchain you can always access them with your private key. Keep it secured !
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:43:31
It’s tax free that’s why it’s tax evasion. You pretend you live overseas when you live in the us and need pay taxes here. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:42:42
Buy you can use the key phrase to get the private keys and sweep it with a different wallet right ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:08:08
You don’t pay taxes when you buy. Only when you sell 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:00:22
Theoretically if you use foreign passport and address and you use Tor to hide your location it will work.  But it’s felony tax evasion.

Drag the wallet out of the installer to the desktop ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:12:48
Bad news cause sell offs. Not price targets.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:48
Worse idea I ever heard. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:11
Who buy bitcoins from some guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:15
I don’t think so. Government will be against it always they want you to use their own currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:05:10
No. Investing money isn’t yours which you borrow from credit card companies is the dumbest move you can ever do with investing.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:32
You issue her a 1099 for her capital gain (consult a cpa). Or make your grandma an account on exchange.

Yes you need to get electrum bitcoin wallet sweep using the private key and the bitcoins will appear.

Is your bank Chase? Chase started rejected payments to coinbase.

Yep same here now. Jamie Dimon damn you. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:38:54
I think people will take profit only if some bad news as far as regulations, as many already have huge profits. If the euphoria continues for a month it can be 14k.  If no bad news = no dip. I assure you. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:57:29
Of course dip. When you least expect it. That’s how it always is 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:28:08
No way. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:21:53
It will crash. People will pull out the cash to survive on. Now the economy is great people can afford spending 5-10k on high risk investments . 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:42:40
People were losing bitcoins because they were worthless and didn’t think it will ever be something. They just out of circulations, there will never be 21 million bitcoins. 
The more valueable they get the more you make sure you don’t lose them  
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:50:10
No recovery phrase?  Then you sol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:16
That’s what the atms do
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:36
Sounds like time to sell 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:04:39
Interesting, if a private key in a living-will it compromise the wallet. So how does it safely survive our generation to our heirs. Hmm. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:33:28
Yeah but it’s a gamble and high risk to risk your house. 10% of your net worth is ok. Not 100% in cryptocurrency even that it is most likely the future 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:54:48
They can’t as they located in Washington which has rules against it. “Know your customer”. And amazon isn’t relocating so - no.  
Laws change though. With time. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:55:52
When everybody expect correction it rarely happens. Also btc passed 10k in many countries. Not everybody use US dollars.

What about in Los Angeles what’s the price of the kWh do you know ? I see these machines in eBay cost 3 times as much as official website. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:22:57
Nothing just speculations bring price so up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:14:48
It’s retroactive. The price you bought is your price just need wait 10 days to receive.

I converted ltc to btc. Got this amount and where the rest of it go? It didn’t go back to ltc. I used shapeshift. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:20:14
When did this happen? Proof? I have chase never had issues account still connected 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:28:55
No one spend because price keep going up. In the future it will be stable like regular currency and then people will spend also
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:45:04
No the price you purchase at is the purchase price. So your up
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:40:23
went to me:

went to shapeshifter:
1BmcCqtQm5xDVuuF7Ayzw1JPEky9C5r46j	     0.03921841
Sent 21.3 ltc, got 0.19706316 btc,  0.03921841 is 4 ltc, they took it? what a scam, this is a rip off.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:34:50
or its going back to me as ltc?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:44
Sure can go down 100% but can go up more than 10,000%.  That’s why diversify and don’t buy coins with your entire savings. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:40:55
That’s what many asked at 7k and now it’s 9.5k. Maybe when reach 10k it drop to 7-8 but unlikely.

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:41
Yea no one really know but if you ask in bitcoin sub of course people will say to put 90% if your net worth. It’s risky 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:40:06
One Redditor was worried about this so didn’t get a new phone.  This is very messed up. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:23
Buy for 1 sell for 2 capital gain is 1 from here it’s 18% after write off losses if you sell in a loss. But ask a cpa for tax advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:58:40
Private key ? Yes it’s enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:48:29
Not true. The tax on capital gain is 1099 not w2 therefor the tax is 18% of total capital gain. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:34:27
so shape shift took $400 from a 2000 transaction? 25%?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:01
What happen when you die ? Your coins gone. Unless you write your private keys in your will but can easily be ripped off by greed.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:11:43
Yes USA. What you referring to is for w2 fillers. When you work and get w2 you pay payroll income tax. Capital Gains aren’t tax free till anything.  Just talk to a CPA don’t ask for tax advice in subReddit. 
If I buy Apple stock for 180 sell for 200 I have $20 profit. If 1000 stocks it’s 20k Capital gains. When you sell at a loss that’s the only time you write off losses.
