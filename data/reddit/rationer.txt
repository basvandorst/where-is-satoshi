and still this is very nice. We know that a lot of people would buy 4-5 different cars, some houses at beaches or in the city, travel a lot and so on. But at least he is doing something damn good...

Yes man, I know. My father has a few of btc on kraken exchange, but I agree. Nothing is safe except real paper wallet. Thanks for your time tho

Thanks dude. Damn it. I did this mistake by being in a hurry.
My bad anyway, cheers

Ok, before I used bitadress.org 
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:18:54
It is the right wallet
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:08:01
Yeah but how is this possible ffs?
It goes to a wallet with 7k of BTC?
I mean How? Without my private key and I verified my blockchain.info account with 2FA aswell
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:27:18
I am not trolling dude, I just fucked up. As I said, I used bitadress before, but with this, I was in a hurry.
Don't worry, I don't want someone's btc, I just wanted to have an explanation how I got scammed.
Answer was: that website. . . Thanks for the info

Well, my father's mailbox got hacked. In a hurry I created a new paper wallet. Scam site. During the hurry I didn't check it .. my bad.
DON'T USE THIS
I transferred a small amount first, check.
Transferred the rest to it, after several minutes all has been taken away.
100% my bad, I was in a hurry and didn't check it.
Somehow it has to be made easier for new folks especially
