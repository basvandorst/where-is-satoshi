That reducing n-locktime mechanism is redundant with the other techniques (spending with a hash input) as far as I know so there is no limitation. And your timelocks need to be specified in blocks not seconds so that other timelock transactions can get confirmed first.

Segwit unlimited was an amateur project that did in fact lead to orphans blocks and lost $12,000 for the kids running it

R/buttcoin has much higher quality content that r/btc....no, it really does

They don't need to interact with the network on a deep level. Talk to people that are working on hardware wallets and they know ever details. To run miners the protocol is not the core of their business. I'm sure they worry more about where cheap power is and the best way to cool hardware. Their knowledge of the protocol is superficial
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:53:53
Segwit unlimited doesn't exist. I just made it up because your question didn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:51:06
Miners and most people are not technical or don't know the details of the technology. Their evaluation is very superficial. From the an ignorant perspective it has "problems". This will be a long battle that may never be won 
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:12:02
It's nice in theory but in person conversation people operating Chinese mining companies do not understand the protocol. I've only talked to a handful but from those conversations your theory does not hold
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:02:19
This is very misleading. Current lightning network implementations require segwit and would have to be rewriten to work around the sigwit bug if sigwit is blocked. No sigwit no lightning network

Unfortunately for your business wallets like mycelium have refused to consider replace by fee as a feature.
This looks to be the obvious solution. There will always be a market for blockspace and their is no avoiding the need to use replace by fee. Either the ecosystem updates their software or these problems will continue
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:28:01
Jihans whole position represents a failure  of the technology. The incentives are designed so miners will compete against each other and by these selfish actions strengthen and create the trustless network. Jihans represents a cartel of colluding miners and is a failure of the system

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:21:32
He's right. It's only for segwit transactions. Segwit are superior and cheaper so there is no reason for people not to switch to them 
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:57:24
What are you talking about? The segwit proposal to increase the blocksize has been available since November. It's currently been blocked by miners.

Ver is a social guy who visits a lot the meetups and did a lot of work to promote bitcoin. No one is going to ostracise him because he has a controversial opinion 
People have talked with him for literally days about why we need segwit. Endless discussions. Nothing will change his mind. Although the Tokyo meetup is becoming a bit of a cult
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:42:49
Don't visit the cult at the Tokyo meetup. Your be ver-y disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:18:17
He just says that. He has zero interest in supporting it. And the ultimate proof is the github repo issue for segwit. No BU devs support segwit and they prefer the alternative FlexTrans

They moved on to selling bitcoin at a 11% markup. This crowd sale is their old scam and no longer relevant. Moving on
Mycelium has really changed. Wonder what happened to that project. I can only assume it was sold or the developers changed completely. 
They are also very anti Core

"then never on chain scaling again." 
Just flatly wrong, false, misinformation and misleading. Also incorrect, or maybe I said that already...  Core has a whole list of on chain scaling ideas in process. Check out their website

We do. It's just a low percentage that got stuck. It's annoying for the people it happened to but it was only a fraction of the transactions that got stuck during the transaction surge at the beginning of the year

FlexTrans was eventually submitted as a BIP. It's vague and hard to follow. You can find the review of it if you search

Please push wallets to support replace by fee. I asked mycelium devs but they didn't know much about bitcoin and were too focused on their crowed sale scam

Post for comedy purposes only. This man lives in China where the government killed 15 million people and you are not allowed to talk about it. But we all know that theymos banning promoting hard forking clients is more evil :D

They said they are pro big blocks and don't like core on their chat. I uninstalled their app after trying to have a technical discussion with them. They are more interested in scams now days than bitcoin

The miners are used as an direct way of measuring support of the whole ecosystem for a fork. The debate is for everyone 
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:27:31
Exactly. Miners only order transactions. It's their only function. They order transactions. That's it. Without a full node their ordering is meaningless 
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:34:45
This sounds insane. Why would you not use replace by fee? Why would anyone not use replace by fee? Why are your  transactions stuck? Why not use replace by fee? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:28:55
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:41:29
Yep no doubt it was broken. Most wallets refused to enable replace by fee which would have fixed the underlying protocol problem 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:52:22
What about 2 segwits and 0.5MB soft and hard fork?

He's used an all caps not to prove it. Proof by capslock. Checkmate

Nope. They don't want segwit. Check the github issue on segwit. They are in favour of FlexTrans

This post from Erik I find very misleading. I would not have high hopes from him
A simple replace by fee or child pays for parent  solve this problem. He's being misleading about the transactions
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:50:46
Yes they secure the order of transactions and make the order immutable 
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:25:49
Segwit means segregated witnesses. The signatures are no longer counted in the 1MB limit. 2MB hard fork plus segwit is ~4MB+ blocksize. But with a hard fork you need 100% node upgrades so deploy of a hard fork is around a year or more compared to the quick soft fork deployments
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:03:15
This is really not the solution to break the network like this. All we need is the wallets to implement replace by fee
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:46:14
Your wallet needs a replace by fee feature to send bitcoins effectively. Unfortunately no wallets support it
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:34:18
This is what makes it a soft fork. New nodes will reject the block and old nodes will see it as an anyone can spend 
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:06:46
Exactly. This is a failure of bitcoin wallets to not have replaced by fee. Mycelium when asked on their chat if they would add it and they said it was low priority. They were too busy running crowd sale scams and selling bitcoin will a 11% markup to noobs
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:40:39
If segwit fails the two best options I see are 1) fire the miners. Change the hashing algorithm so we can move forward with bitcoin progress 2) create an alt coin and move away from bitcoin
