What are the pros/cons with open/close source? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:41:42
Thanks for the summary mate!

It's deflationary characteristic makes it so. A lot of people want it to be mainstream and replace FIAT, but the *HODL* attitude keeps it from being used by everyone.

People's natural reaction to things they can't understand is Fear.

I think you can Google Escheatment Laws for your state for that.

I can taste the salt from here. I believe in my investments and don't need to justify how I choose to invest/spend my money, especially to some pseudo-intellectual like you.

Don't understand all the German but with all the Mt. Gox action at increased security and regulation, I believe crypto-vets see this as an opportunity to buy the upcoming dips. 
Plus with the groundwork being set to make sure no one has to be scammed again this would provide traction for confidence in crypto and hopefully by end of year we see the x2-5 marketcap

Wouldn't it pump the supply and decrease the value? Plus the money they're recouping, i'm pretty sure they ain't doing that for charity or to reclaim their good name.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I'm not exactly Goxxed, but my friend was.
Also after reading up on it a bit. They're proposing the returns via fiat? People bought BTC, why shouldnt they get BTC. Their money, assuming the incident didn't happen, should've raised in value, and will still increase if taken off the market.
Also, issues with claims, and surplus. It seems they're doing their best as they are now being chased by legal issues, but they should've done that shit way back.
This would be good news to some people, but this is just poor restitution that would negatively affect the market. I'd be glad to be proven wrong.

Is Mt. Gox just full of assholes?

Looking back on it, with the 20k boom a loot of people became *greedy*. Now we're dipping a lot are *fearful*. But at the start of the year, analysts' consensus is that we'll get to &gt;20k.
I'm just hodling. HODLGANG 4 lyf.

Correct me if I'm wrong but a country's currency value is tied to it's assets in gold/petrol/etc in the global market/reserves. If they go the crypto route, wouldn't it be better since it's a lot more secure and inflation proof? The only challenge were facing right now into heading in this direction is regulation, stability, and adoption.

Was in a client meeting with our SVP and they had a short discussion at the end about crypto (working for one of the major multinational US bank.)
He said that he doesn't believe in crypto as it's value is tied to nothing (which is technically true) and our client believes that it's a fad like the tulip bubble. These guys are getting 6 figure salaries while at max I only make 4. I'm still 27 but these guys are around their 50s. I still don't understand how they cannot see that this is the future.

Easier and harder to buy at the same time. More exchanges = easier, Credit Card company restriction = harder. For the selling, it's a lot harder, especially with all the FUDs, plus talks of regulation.

Aye, that's why we go for quantum resistant coins.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:41:55
This wouldn't be for another 100 years though, and they would have found fixes for maintaining the ledger other than PoW.
Would be more concerned with quantum computing in the near future, and the SHA-256 not being quantum resistant.

I'm glad ETF didn't go through. Well just get rightly fucked even more by the 1%. 
Also allows me to buy more at a lower price.

Wouldn't be surprised if true. Fraudsters are thieves at their very core.
