Assuming not, you are mistaken. Let me clear it up further.
I have personally run the c++ client and go client and created contracts and sent them to a testnet chain. It is much more than promises. It is software that runs on a computer.
It is my opinion that you should do more research into what actually has and has not been accomplished with this project so far. Your passion against Ethereum would be much better served if it was backed by truthful arguments.

It looks like the user doesn't have to control the bitcoin address where the money goes. 
An employee could accept bitcoin for a store without having access to the store funds.

Listen, I *get* that you don't approve of the funding strategy of Ethereum, but there is a lot to show for the project already. There is already a working, albeit rough, codebase, and there are talented developers working on interesting applications. There's no need to degrade your argument with half truths and vitriolic comments.

I realize you probably don't care about the actual answer, but here it is for anyone interested in learning about its status:
From the [Ethereum Dev plan]( page 14:

It *does* exist, albeit in a very bare bones form -- their v5 proof of concept. I believe their intention is to flesh out the client further before launch, so its usable without needing extensive technical knowledge, as is needed now.

How does this work considering the original codebase that OpenBazaar is based on (DarkMarket) is AGPL licensed?
Is there not a conflict there?

I've heard this as well.
To build off that: Bitcoin is very good at being money; it allows units to be sent between different 'accounts', it has various useful features for money(time lock, multiparty accounts) and there is a hard limit to the bitcoin supply. For the most part, people use bitcoins as units of value to exchange goods.
Ether, on the other hand, does not seem like it will be used primarily this way. There are no built-in 'money features' (other than the ability to transfer units between accounts) and there is no hard cap to the ether supply. Its primary function is to power the programs that live in the Ethereum blockchain. They even use the terminology 'gas' to denote the amount of ether spent on running a program. 
In this way, ether is the 'oil' necessary to power the Ethereum machines, and bitcoin is the 'gold' desired by humans.

You missed the point of my reply. I'm beginning to feel you are not here for real discussion, merely here to feed an agenda. That aside, I will explain for the sake of discussion.
Making a repo is easy. Making software that properly executes an idea is much harder. My point was not that "there are so many repos, look at all that progress". The point is, if you had bothered to read or run the code, that there are multiple *working software* that execute the Ethereum idea, and that there are *working Ethereum contracts* that that can act in useful ways. There are many people actively working on these ideas and actually putting down code. For you to describe that as "nonexistent" and to downplay this visible, tangible progress as "anyone can make a repo" is complete rubbish.

DNSChain is working on something like this. Just add a DNSChain-enabled DNS server to your /etc/resolv.conf

tl;dw: As we get accustomed to the bitcoin ecosystem, we peel back the bitcoin ideals and see that what has manifested is more of the same shit we were trying to escape from. At this point, most people put the blinders on and toe the party line, mostly guided by subconscious avoidance of the unknown.

I had the same issue. Damaged foil sticker, I figured it was just of poor quality. But it was definitely damaged enough for someone to have gotten access to the device.

TCP actually originally included IP
