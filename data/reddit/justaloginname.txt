There are elections other than presidential ones...

 Vote third party...


Yeah, it's almost like our government provides a relatively favorable and adaptable environment for business and development with a long track record of success.

Too true.

You're the one that's mad your vote doesn't count for more...
That being immature is just my observation. Good on you for not addressing any of the actual argument though. Telling. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 20:44:38
I mean...that's just not true either. 
Again, back to the boat thing. Some yacht deals are finalized by US citizens in the middle of the ocean to avoid paying sales tax. 
You can also commission and register in a different country. 
There are lots of things you can do.

Yes...because boring is a horrible trait in a leader?
Did you bother to see that part about voting in non-presidential elections?


The problem here is that you obviously haven't thought much of this out. You don't seem dumb, just too lazy to learn about complex systems and too egotistical to admit your intelligence isn't anything special.

A big part of what I do is knowing and understanding the tax system. One trick is to...you know...not break the law or incur penalties. 
I'm not going to argue about the morality of our tax system. I think we both agree that it's a mess and pretty unfair. The best anyone can do is vote and be educated.

You're basically bemoaning that you're vote doesn't have a larger influence on the winner and ignoring that it's meaningful to tally votes, even if you're on the losing side. 
I think it's immature because it makes you sound like you're mad about not being a special snowflake with more influence.

They don't even know how far off SF they'd need to be to escape US laws...it's a bit further than 12nm.

Meh, bitcoin isn't important...or at least not more important than any other high volatility commodity choice in an investment portfolio.
Why you would say its more important than voting is beyond me...like you have to choose to only do one.
@_date: 2016-09-22 15:30:19


Yes, which is why you should be educated about the tax code and what you can do to limit exposure. 


Just am immature way to look at it. 
First, there are elections other than the big presidential ones. Not many people vote in those...if you want to think about this like a "weight" problem.
Secondly, it matters how many votes the loser gets. Losing by lower margins translates to more legitimacy the next year. The candidate or party of your choosing could get more money, campaign better, and have a better chance as their perceived chance of victory is higher.

No. I did address it. I explained why I think it's important to vote even if you know you're voting for the losing party! Did you bother to read my response? Here, I'll repost for you:






Yeah, civilizations are complex and hard to manage. Our system has done a pretty good job outperforming the rest though.
