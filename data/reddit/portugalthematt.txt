Actually they confirmed today they would come out with multiple new product lines this year.  And you cannot sum this up as them being non-truthful

Yes, Google Play store reserves most of the same rights - except they are more lenient on the policy it seems.

That is for users who are physically unable to use the power button... and has a side use for restarting the phone if the power button fails.

Follow along with me here:  Most people are not bit coin users.  Most bit coin users are not Apple investors.  Most bit coin users that are apple investors don't invest on emotions.  Most apple investors that invest on emotions will not actually sell their positions because of reddit.

No, it's an emotional response.  In the case of your murder example, I would sell because they would get hit with a lawsuit, and the stock price would go down due to their loss of profits from it, or their senior management team would be fired.  Plus me being invested in the company does not help or impede (in the case that I sell) their illegal processes.  Same goes for PM and other controversial companies.


-Not a very good idea, plus we know he isn't just doing it to replace with a similar beta stock - which again is a terrible investment strategy - he is doing it because reddit is circle jerking anti-Apple...
