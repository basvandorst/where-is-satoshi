Is it possible the funds were in another coinbase account? When you log in, do you see a transaction history clearing out what you had?
Sorry to hear about this. :/

I just wrote a tutorial on how to crack passwords on USB sticks, complete with details on using DD like the good folks below recommend. Posting it here in case it's helpful for you or others who stumble across this: 
Good luck!

The process he is describing to obtain a minimum amount of data for cracking the password is safe and commonly used. Folks working with him should closely review the Python script he sends, which of course by default will be source code that is 100% visible. They can share that source code with a more technical friend for a second opinion before running it.
I don't know OP and haven't reviewed the script, but at some point people with lost passwords may need help and this type of service could be viable.
Nice work on the rig, BTW OP. Very cool.

You can use this free open source tool to recover your password:  There is a lot of info in this link on how to get started.
If you have a computer with a GPU, hashcat also now supports passwords from Bitcoin Core wallets. I'm halfway through writing a tutorial on doing this hashcat, I'll post it when ready.
Good luck! If you need help, let me know.
