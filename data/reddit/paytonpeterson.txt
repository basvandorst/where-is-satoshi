The Butterfly Labs website is now appearing online. Looks like the website was just offline for a while last night. Thanks for all your feedback. I will be updating the article as soon as I get my website back online.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:40:18
My site is clean. The main site is dorktech.com and my link shortening service is called dorkte.ch
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:12:44
If anyone has any information on what is going on, please comment on this post or on the website. Thanks!

Not sure when the projected delivery date is. I did calculate an algorithm to BFL's shipping methods: Projected date + time-to-obsolete + 4 months + 2 weeks shipping = delivered.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:33:21
I am aware. Working with my CDN partners to get everything back online.

They will always do whats most profitable - was talking to a casino manager last week and he told me they make $200K-$400k night just on slot play. Yea, now thats what I call profit.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:38:34
None of the such... I run the website (dorktech.com) and the link shortening service (dorkte.ch). I am completely transparent with both of my sites and they will not steal anything. I'm an ethical guy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:53:26
Thats what I was thinking! Wonder if anyone can prove it via examination of the blockchain. Probably take quite a lot of digging though.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:52:27
My apologies if my article caused any frustration. Most signs pointed to the website being down last night, and it was for several hours. With the context of the events of this past week, I assumed the worst before anything was confirmed. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:31:54
Yes - the link links to my website, (dorkTech.com) through my link shortening service (dorkte.ch). I link to my website because I wrote an article on why I thought BFL was offline.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:40:37
Sent out a couple emails and called their office. I will report if I hear anything from BFL. (Sidenote: Last time I emailed BFL, it took them 4 weeks to reply)

I would just go about not using Gox for my daily transactions as my form of revolting, and not try to hack them out of anger. Although don't get me wrong, I am very frustrated.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:44:29
Thinking back, why did we use those guys in the first place...?
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:29:09
They saw it worked for Mt Gox and figured they should do it as well.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:31:15
I'm pretty sure they did mine with their own equipment for a while before they were shipped. Most of the gear I got from them showed signs that they were used before I received them. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:16:35
If anyone has any additional information they would like to contribute on the BitSafe, please comment here, or on the article comments page.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:19:57
I actually have bought a few miners from them - took forever to get them and seemed used, but they did ship me products, so can't fault them there.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:31:58
It's *you're*. 
I've made about 10K doing crypto-currency mining. (would have been about 120k if MtGox didn't disappear)
Besides that, I have been mining for over 3 years, not to make profit, but because I believed in the idea.
Guess I should goto journalist school huh? :)
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:15:41
I will be adding that information to my article and crediting you. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:04:10
It could be - I just walked by "The D" on Freemont and took that photo and asked a bartender for details. They could have been doing this for a while, but the guy I asked said they just started accepting BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:30:14
Thats is a link shortening/tracking service for my website dorkTech. I wrote an article on it talking about my observations of ButterflyLabs being offline. The link shorting URL is dorkte.ch. So excuse my tacky URL - I just use it to run links through to track stats which help me optimize the website.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:37:01
Yes - I received the Reddit hug of Death. Working with my CDM platform right now.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:08:19
You don't understand how Bitcoin works...
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:34:23
I have have 90% of my bitcoins at MtGox, nearly three years of mining. Im extremely disappointed this happened, all that waiting for nothing? Does anyone think I can press legal charges against them?
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:09:14
I don't get paid by companies to endorse them. It's just my website, my opinion. Figured I would share some thoughts about CryptoDouble. I do not directly endorse them.
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:43:45
An article where I discuss my thoughts on CryptoDouble. Let me know how you feel about the service.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:46:40
You'd be surprised.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:37:56
Glad you came on Reddit. Hope to see concerned people ask you questions and get this figured out. We need to work together to make crypto the best it can be. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:57:37
What if it works?
@_date: 2015-03-24 00:08:52
I wasn't paid to start a discussion. I just want to see a day when crypto has more positive news and interactions happening than negative. To the outsiders - our entire industry is a huge un-professional mess.
I never wish harm or failure to any legit crypto company, because it takes a village. Who are we to cut out people and companies from trying to change, invent, or educate in the crypto industry - it really needs all the help it can get. 
I just think people jump to conclusions too fast and should allow time for companies to try to right themselves and improve their service/image.
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:55:21
Thanks for the link. How strange. It's unprofessional if they are using individual names instead of company names in the first place. Appreciate the find, keep digging.
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:56:19
From what I've seen, you can signup with your email on their website and wait for an invite. I'm in the same boat, waiting to try it myself.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:45:57
You're right.
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:06:51
So you want to see a company die that you have never been personally involved with?
@_date: 2015-03-23 03:29:47
So you're personally in this? What is your story? Did you loose money with GAW?
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:01:20
Long read, indeed. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:28:17
I disagree, fast confirmation times are important - it really is the base of what makes crypto great. To be able to have a network verify a transaction is pretty much the gearbox of crypto - so it does matter in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:50:27
Interesting... they are gifts from Josh's Amazon account - directly? Please show me where you saw this. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:39:12
If anyone has used this service, please let me know.
