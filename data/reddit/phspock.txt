Happy with Ripple...but centralised / decentralised? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:42:20
would now be a good time to use some of my HoDle BTC to but my favourite ALTs...NEO,OMG..and one more, but can't decide?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:20:29
I hear you Geeze! BTC for me, but that said, there are some worthy coins out there promoting IoT for example...
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:50:56
There's a lot of conflicting opinion on LTC, why's that? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:07:46
From Dec 2nd...  even so, Iv'e done my research and for me BTC is the king as far as I'm concerned. :-)) 
Believe it or not, this is a genuine enquiry... and I'm 100% sold on BTC long term. That said, can we have a look at the percentages without smart ass comments?
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:53:53
Have to stop somewhere...
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:58:48
I only use Binance at the moment, no idea when they will be listing this at the moment, but I am looking into XRB now...Hope I'm not too late to buy in with this.....

I have 64% of my portfolio invested in BTC and steadfastly remain a long term Hodler since December 17. However, with some really interesting ALTs out there, common sense tells me to diversify a bit further.  Let's take a poll for everyone's benefit... I'm at 64%....Be true!

You Guys are way ahead of me on FUD. In Crypto since late November...what the fuck?....
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:17:36
Thanks, 80/20

Interesting...many thanks. 
I'm thinking current noise in the marketplace is without any firm direction, when we talk about BTC in the community. There is so much division and uncertainty.
I believe BTC is a sound investment in the long term (1) on the basis that, as far as I can see, team are working on improving the tech, security and transaction times. (2) BTC has consistently weathered the dips and has been on an upward trend for so long. (3) Is the most widely Hodled coin there is (at the moment). 
Having said that, there are some fantastic opportunities to take part in the revolution....!  Exiting, but extremely volatile times, don't you think?
By the way,  ICX looks like it could be big, have you looked at any similar ICO's that may present competition, or do they stand alone at the moment. Any idea?
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:22:53
I think there may be...I would say 50/50 either up or down :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:28:40
This is a bit of a long read to say the least, but it has some very interesting observations about market volume....

Are you planning to introduce Fiat pairs - Binance ticket and their reply: 
What do we think about this?..........
I and many others in the UK and US love Binance.
Can you let me know if you have plans to introduce fiat pairs? I would be grateful if you could escalate this request to Management for a reply. I, and many others on Twitter and Reddit will support Binance even more; over other exchanges, if you introduce fiat. 
Appreciation your for the excellent suggestion so much! It is very helpful for us to improve Binance Exchange. We may not response the ticket directly, but you may see the suggestion will be part of Binance Functionality soon or later.
Binance Team

For all us Hodlers:
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:41:15
What to you sell into in between?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:50:03
Funny how we took so much crap from the 'he fell for the hodel' brigade. Hey.....

Well, after the mayhem over the last few days, we may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
This from BTCManager today:
"Back in early October 2014, a disappointed bitcoin holder dumped 30,000 coins on the market when the price was on its support from its previous all-time high. Someone thought the party was over and decided to cash out and almost drove the prices to levels seen in 2010."
The Gox Dump has has the same effect, but again the community has stood strong and there seems to be pressure on Nobuaki Kobayashi to deal with creditors in a less damaging way. 
If he distributes creditors funds in fiat, it could mean that no more large sell orders effect the market.
The upshot is that in October 14 the community defeated the Whale and that reversal fed back through the market in a positive way. 
We're not out of the woods yet but now it's clear that among other less damaging market factors; the Gox incident has largely been responsible for this fall, the public may again begin to rally in support of Crypto and recognise that the Crypto community remains united and stronger than these massive forced market swings.
The full article is here:

If I were that person, Sure I would share it with the crypto communities on here. Price manipulation by the whales has to be countered somehow and to that end we should all stand together everywhere..... 
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:28:02
I think we should anticipate the normal Sunday dip when the US wakes up, and reason why we shouldn't?
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:37:47
And now, the end is near; and so I face, the final curtain. My Friends; I'll say it clear, I state my case, of which I'm certain.........And through it all when there was doubt, I ate it up. And spat it out...........you know the rest......By the way, I'm holding, so should you.
