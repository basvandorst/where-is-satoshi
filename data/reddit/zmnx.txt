Enforceable "made up" scarcity of bitcoin is equal or better than "natural" scarcity like gold. If we suddenly discovered a ton of gold, say goodbye to gold prices.
Value is a construct of the mind. When there is consensus between two or more parties, exchange can happen. I agree that Bitcoin is not mainstream enough to warrant your support but that has little to do with how Bitcoin is valued versus dogecoin in terms of scarcity.

I'd rather use my card then.

Please tip me. Thanks bro.

I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

Doesn't look like budget pricing.

The point is that you're a blabbering fool.

Except your math is shitty. We value valid applications of math.

Bitcoin is great but I find it silly to make a payment like this.

I love Bitcoin but fuck this big brother bullshit.

You don't ever go full retard.

What needs to happen is that merchants need to give discounts for btc, enough to at least offset the costs of using btc for the customer.

Kind of like a brojob isn't gay because you know, it's a joke.

Accept bitcoin donations. Get elected. Ban bitcoin. 
I'll keep my money!

Coinbase has what you call the Vault.

you just did it again. check yoself.

your reply is similar to how she talks. but this time you trivialized the importance of a straight answer from an authority at LL. keep laughing or whatever, i guess?:

When asked if the larger hurdles have been passed and if the development is now more focused on honing the code, she gave an essay's worth of fluff. I stopped listening then and now am concerned about the ltn legitimacy.

You got trolled bro. The only way to win is to not play.

This is a joke of a survey. The questions are not very well thought out. If you need proof read the replies here.

What a great idea! A "bitcoin kit" containing all you need to get started for sending and receiving bitcoin. It would be great to give away or sell these "bitcoin kits" so that anyone can get started with ease.

You made an assertion and attempted to justify it with a generalization. Do you realize that can be problematic?
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:42:54
Notice how your reply is full of conjecture. That's why no one takes you seriously. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:09:12
The problem is that you're making uninformed statements.

Bitmit != bitcoin
