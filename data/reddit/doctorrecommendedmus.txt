And I guess we're assuming China isn't going to 'ban' Bitcoin again? I have a feeling if people in China are using BTC to escape the government's capital controls, they will almost certainly 'crackdown' on BTC exchanges.

Well it sounds like you know a bit more than nothing.
If you want to integrate Bitcoin into your business, you can do so with zero risk by using a service like BitPay. If you do so, you will be using Bitcoin the technology as payment processing system (one of many uses of the technology). You do not need to hold any bitcoins before of after the transaction. BitPay allows you to accept bitcoins and instantly convert them into AUD, USD, CAD, whatever you want. You do not need to use an exchange whatsoever.
However, if you looking to use Bitcoin as a speculative investment, which is what you said you were doing originally, then I stand by my statements.

Jesus christ this kid has better punctuation and grammar than 99% of internet users. That's fucking awesome.
Short answer, yes. In fact, starting small is much smarter than starting big - it will give you an opportunity to learn the market and technicals. In addition, you won't have to be as concerned if things tank.
Have you looked into how to keep your bitcoin safe and secure? Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into before you make the leap. 
It's also important to fully understand and consider why you're buying bitcoin. It sounds like you're interested in making a long term investment (ie. not buying things with it). If that's the case, now might be a good time to buy, but that is by no means advice.

Turns out my biggest problem (everyone's too actually) is that the majority of people ARE lazy. This is something I've learned to mediate in my daily life, and that involves not encouraging it.
As I said, bitcoin is a long way from being used by the majority of people because it is not friendly to lazy people in its current form. When it is, you'll be using and you won't be posting questions which have easily accessible answers if you're not a fucking lazy sheep.
I was using the internet when I had to plug my windows 3.1 computer with a modem @ 56kbs. 'Most' (lazy?) people weren't using it then, mainly because they had no idea how it worked and it took too much time to learn how it and its technology functioned. In fact, this is still true but the internet evolved into a form which made its incredible utility accessible to even the most lazy and/or incompetent, for better or worse.
Hey, you're using the internet now. Do you know how it works? Do you even know what HTTP stands for?

The real social issue, I believe, is apathy and education. The average/ignorant person doesn't know what money actually is, how it comes into existence, what the fed is, what inflation is, what economics is, etc etc etc.
Bitcoin is putting this discourse into conversations that normally would never occur, at least partially because there is a financial incentive to do so.
Bitcoin isn't political, people make it political - just like the internet. These are technological instruments.

Anyone who has been involved in Bitcoin for longer than a year knows that:
1) Mt Gox has a history of technical failures, including a DDoS attack in April of last year when they were the only exchange around which crashed the price. People then were shouting the death of bitcoin, and yet here we are a year later with massive growth in bitcoin startups and interest in general. I, myself, used Mt Gox to buy my first bitcoin but (not having my head in the sand) realized that fiat withdrawals were nearly impossible and moved my bitcoin elsewhere. Which brings me to my second point;
2) If you keep any large amount of bitcoin anywhere you don't control the private keys, you are taking a huge risk (didn't we learn this when people's online wallets were hacked? Or with Silk Road V1.0?). Some people take on this risk because laziness, greed, or a complete lack of homework into what they are investing. None of these are good enough reasons to have my sympathy. And finally;
3) The fundamentals haven't changed. Mt Gox IS NOT BITCOIN. Mt Gox might go away, but Bitcoin will not and if people are worried about what the rest of the world incorrectly perceives it is only because they are concerned about the price and most likely have NOT done their homework and have most likely invested more than they can afford to lose.
I'm sorry for your speculative losses, but crying about it on Reddit isn't going to garner my support when you clearly have no idea what you're doing.

Even after losing his investment, Collin remains a staunch bitcoin advocate and intends to continue to invest in the digital currency. “This lawsuit has nothing to do with bitcoin, its prospects or longevity,” he said. “Bitcoin saves people money and that bottom line is the reason it will thrive.”
“It knocked the wind out of people, so we’re sitting on the sidelines, refocusing, waiting for some paycheques to come in and maybe moving some stocks around. We’ll bring our money back to the table,” Collin said.
“It won’t happen overnight, but people like me will be back because we truly believe in the technology.”

Sometimes reporters play dumb because they're trying to get the professionals to answer common questions (ie. what the misinformed skeptics would ask).

While I agree that you shouldn't need your governments permission, they feel obligated to keep you safe from yourself and will punish you with the full weight of the law (or just take your money) if you don't let them.
Also, you'll probably make a higher return (as compared to 'fiat') if you just hodl your bitcoin. That being said, investing in Bitcoin startups is a great way to 'spend' your bitcoin and support the ecosystem. Caveat Emptor as usual though.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:52:37


It is risky. Anyone who thinks otherwise is incompetent, lazy and/or greedy, and anyone who 'invests' in Bitcoin without understanding (ie. a little research) and accepting those risks is again, incompetent, lazy and/or greedy. Don't invest in what you don't know, if you do and you lose everything that makes you an idiot not a victim.

By Brett Cole
A bitcoin derivatives trading platform created in Australia, btc.sx, is on the brink of securing venture capital funding from investors as it seeks to offer round-the-clock trading in the crypto-currency round from New York, London and Singapore.
A US-based hedge fund and Asian-based investors are negotiating term sheets with btc.sx founder Joseph Lee and chief operating officer George Samman, who this week departs for New York where he will look to establish an office to cash in on the bitcoin mania.
“When you’re in a gold rush you sell the picks and shovels,” Mr Samman told DataRoom in an interview. “Our business is growing hand over fist.”
About $US140,000 ($154,031) worth of bitcoin trades are daily executed on the btc.sx platform, which enables speculators to go long or short on the crypto-currency with leverage bets of up to 10 times.
Btc.sx’s prices are based on the European bitcoin exchange Bitstamp and since May last year about $US43 million worth of trades have been executed on the Australian platform.
Mr Lee, who worked at Barclays and Macquarie Group, now has a team of five working at btc.sx that is incorporated in Singapore and London, the latter being cheaper than Sydney in terms of technology development costs.   
There are about 12 million bitcoins in circulation with a market value of about $US6.78 billion, according to Mr Samman.
The bitcoin spot price is about $US565 but is volatile, with prices jumping from $US20 at the beginning of last year to more than $US1300 towards the end of 2013. The bitcoin price then collapsed to about $US450 after the bankruptcy and criminal investigation of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.
Still, Mr Samman says “bitcoin is the future of money”, as many have lost faith in central banks and governments that have re-inflated an asset bubble by printing money, ultimately devaluing their own currencies.
Bitcoin is not the only crypto-currency. There are about 50 such currencies, according to Mr Samman, including litecoin, auroracoin, ripple and peercoin.
Other firms, such as Coinarch, are trying to establish crypto-currency trading platforms.
“Many months ago we had spoken to people at Coinarch about our ideas and future vision,” says Mr Samman. “I guess they saw an opportunity too.”

I've also re-invested about 25% of my bitcoin into Bitcoin startups.
I'm not rich. I already have all/most of the material possessions I need (which isn't much - music gear, computers mainly) so it's normal for me not to spend fiat very often as well. 
In addition, I'm in Canada so places that I can spend bitcoin is limited (can't wait to buy my groceries with it). That being said, I donated more with bitcoin last year than I probably ever have with fiat - it's so easy, fast and transparent.

Keeping your money or bitcoin on any exchange is not best practice, especially if you have no idea who runs the exchange. People who have funds of any kind on btc-e are taking on that risk. Best practice is to keep bitcoins securely in some sort of [cold storage]( with redundant backups.
There are significant technical onramps for the average user which will be addressed by new startups in the industry.
Anyone can write anything on the internet (including Reddit), and it is recommended to do thorough due diligence before exclaiming anything as fact without the appropriate evidence to do so.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:36:37
I'm confused about the context here...
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:47:16
Absolutely. Well it, or something very similar. It will/could bring near-frictionless, international, instantaneous commerce to everyone who has access to the internet. It will/could allow many of the people in the world who have no access to a bank access and participation to a global market and self-banking. It will/could allow people to hold their money/value without interference and manipulation from their own or other governments (anyone for that matter). It has many other applications which I could go on about, and many other applications that neither I or anyone else has yet thought of.
Bitcoin is like the internet for money and in many ways that analogy is very true. It has the potential to change the world and that is why I got involved in Bitcoin and that is why it pisses me off when the focus is on the exchange rate and when speculators crawl Reddit looking for easy (and misguided) advice, because they are in no way interested in the technology, or supporting it, and only about cashing out their bitcoins when the exchange rate is high.

When I first started using the internetz, I had to use a telephone connection plugged into a 256mb RAM win 3.1 PC with a 56K DIAL UP modem. Holy shit did you have to be tech savvy to use the fuckin thing back then, and also very patient.
Today, the dumbest (happiest?) village idiot can put his/her finger to their mobile phone and do the same thing. The large majority of people who use the internet today have no fucking idea how it works, or even how it evolved, and yet they use it relentlessly, even to post amazing pictures of what they had for breakfast (/s). 
Yup, you're right.
P.S. I also remember a time when it was unwise to post any/all of your private information online, and not advisable to assume random internet strangers are trust-worthy. This was of course before Facebook. Gee I miss those days sometimes...

Pretty much this. The IRS took the same stance as Canada's version (CRA). If you've converted more fiat to bitcoin, than bitcoin to fiat, you haven't realized a gain yet.
You should be worried about taxes when making small purchases with bitcoin as much as you are when you sell something on kijiji.

Incorrect. Sorry, but it's fairly clear from your statement that you don't understand the internet (and therefore, most likely, bitcoin).
What does the internet facilitate in its rawest form? The transmission of information, or data. Therefore any previous mechanism for data transmission could be considered 'competition.'
Short list:
-movie rentals
Additionally, the internet isn't necessarily competing with previous technology, but could be complimenting it (ex. Netflix). The same can be said about Bitcoin and other financial instruments such as debit/credit cards.


Care to elaborate about your point here?

@_date: 2014-03-27 20:04:38
In order for bitcoin to be used a currency, the volatility needs to go down. In order for the volatility to go down, we need more liquidity (market cap). In order to get more liquidity, we need the icky banker/investment types.
Everything is going according to plan - the polarized politics will be kicking and screaming every step of the way. Pragmatism is required.
@_date: 2014-03-22 09:16:50
Yes you can transfer Btc to Havelock. Can't remember what the registration requirements where, but I removed the vast majority of my own Btc from there when they moved from Canada to Panama and CAVirtex suddenly delisted.
I'd recommend not putting anything more than you can afford to lose on there, although I haven't had any issues aside from what I've mentioned. I find they're security satisfactory.
Also, if you're a US citizen I wouldn't recommend it. There's a lot of legal grey surrounding 'securities' with Bitcoin, and it sounds like the SEC is taking interest.

@_date: 2014-02-21 01:13:09
A lot needs to happen with Bitcoin before it is used by the masses, including a much higher market cap/liquidity and overall usability. However, if you understand the fundamentals (which I doubt you do), then Bitcoin (or something like it) is the next logical step in this grand experiment we call the economy. And the fundamentals alone are plenty of reason why the masses will eventually use it.
Most people buying Bitcoin now either know how to use it in its current form (ie they are tech savvy) or are speculating. 
If you read about it *in* the news, and you buy some using that as your only source of information about Bitcoin, then you are most definitely speculating and most definitely an idiot.
I never said fuck anyone but thanks for the colourful language.

~~Wow that makes a lot more sense. My bad.~~
Am I reading this correctly? Doesn't the below paragraph speak to the price of one share equivalent to bitcoin?
'This bet resolves as No if the NYSE:BRK-A share trades at all points during normal trading hours on March 16th, 2015 over the USD value of 314.59764223 Bitcoin, calculated by taking the 30-day price average of the top two Bitcoin exchanges active on March 13th'
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:17:10
When you buy that $1000 (fiat equivalent) item, you're making a disposition equal to that amount, therefore;
$100 (ACB) - $1000 (disposition) = -$900 (you report $900 as capital gain)

@_date: 2014-03-26 00:38:39
This is exactly why we need a Reddit built on top of something like the Bitcoin protocol - so voting actual has and costs value. A vote could obviously be like $0.00001 (or whatever), and then spam/trolls would be forced to pay for it. The proceeds would go to [the] Reddit, and voila, monetization. I'd pay for that, since I already pay for Reddit, but with all the trolls lately, I'm way less inclined to renew my subscription.
BRB going to patent office ;)
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:53:54
Legally/technically: subtract that fiat 'disposition' from your 'adjusted cost basis'
Ex: $1000 worth of bitcoin (your initial fiat 'investment') minus $1 coffee = $999 adjusted cost basis.
You can also deduct any fees you pay, like exchange fees, from you adjusted cost basis.
Once your ACB is negative, you're now making **Capital Gains**! Yeah math!
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:13:04
Primer: 
“I’d much rather get to a floating fee system with NO hard-coded relay fee rule sooner,” Andresen has said. What he means is that ultimately, transaction fees won’t be hard coded at all.
Garzik calls hard coded fees a bug, and a dynamic system of ‘floating’ transaction fees is preferable. In this scenario, the free market would decide both the relay limits and the block inclusion thresholds.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:14:58

TL:DR DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH YOU LAZY GREEDY ASSHATS


This is misleading. Exchanges in Canada can't accept deposits directly because it makes them a money handling business which requires them to pretty much be a bank and follow ALL of those regulations.
Virtex ran into the account closure issue a few times last year. They've been able to avoid the whole scenario by partnering up with an actual money handler to accept the deposits which is then translated to your account on the Virtex web site/exchange. This is essentially what BTCChina is also now doing and Canadian exchanges will have to continue to do unless they become actual banks.
Now, I'm well aware many people are lazy and just want to get rich quick. This is why a new small exchange (who does roughly 10 btc a day in volume) can potentially have a significant misleading impact in the media when they release unfounded and sensational reports.
The only statements I've seen from the Canadian government were "bitcoin is not money, it's a commodity. Oh ya, and pay your taxes when you make a disposition on that commodity. Oh ya, and we're making our own digital-currency because we want to be cool too"

If you've been involved with Bitcoin for awhile, which I have, you'd know inviting speculators into Bitcoin is not something that is widely encouraged and not generally thought of as being 'good' for Bitcoin. Reddit is full of speculators and incredibly ignorant/incompetent/greedy people who don't know anything about Bitcoin except for the exchange rate. Sure there are a few people on here that are not, but most of the intelligent/experienced Bitcoin participants are well aware of the garbage on Reddit and generally don't waste their time posting on here.
I'm not here to convince people to use Bitcoin. I know it's value and utility and others will too when the time is right - that time is not now. 
The truth is Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption (as I've said many times) and those who are interested in supporting the technology right now aren't on r/bitcoin asking how they can throw money at it without knowing what it is. If you want to support Bitcoin, educate yourself first and THEN invest if you believe in the technology. By that time you won't have to ask random internet strangers the best and easiest way to get some (which is really not a good way to go about it).
People out there who are telling you to buy Bitcoin without first trying to educate you are probably only interested in the fiat exchange rate and are not doing you any favors. I personally don't care about the exchange value and, as it's been said many times before, the price is a distraction from the real technology.

@_date: 2014-03-24 02:59:10
Nope. People are learning some unfortunately costly lessons about security/greed/investing/etc.
I'm not worried about mass adoption either, it's not ready for it yet and I would bet most of the 'newbies' who are losing money aren't interested in much else than speculation. Those who have bitcoin for other reasons (spending, store of value, etc) know how to keep them safe (ie. not on exchanges) because they have done their research.
In my eyes, this is the evolution of a new technology/money. Evolution is the right word because things (people, businesses, etc) will grow and/or die. It's going to be messy, but it's unavoidable.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:54:34

Not really too cheap, to be fair. Like I said, it was an experiment. Months ago I recall a multimillion dollar transaction that went through the blockchain with no transaction fee paid and it didn't have any issues.

Let's not forget bitcoin is still very young and will admittedly function much better as a currency once the price stabilizes.  This will happen probably within a few years and most likely not until the market cap is much higher. However, as a utility for transferring any sum of money anywhere in the world with very little friction it will remain valuable for a very, very long time. 
In addition, I personally don't believe a society dependent on debt is good economically or ethically. Saving up and buying something (bitcoin) is much better for a stable economy rather than borrowing from the unknown and uncertain future (fiat). That's not to say I think all debt is bad (I don't), however it needs to be managed responsibly and that clearly is not being done in most of the world.

Back in April the market depth on Clark Moody was 70k+ bitcoins being offered. Lately it's been around 12k.

I stopped obsessing about the price months ago. I genuinely believe bitcoin has the potential to make the world a better place and view my investment in bitcoin as a soldier fighting the good fight. Hopefully it wins, but it's worth the fight either way.
That being said, I think it's natural to get a bit excited. Once bitcoin matures I think greed will subside.

Ya that was my plan too originally but it's a fine line between trying to be giving and offending someone by giving them what they think is monopoly money.
The honest truth is that Bitcoin is not ready for main stream adoption. It really doesn't have to be to continue increasing in value. This is like your average joe being able to buy Facebook stocks from day one, only it's a lot easier to get Facebook stocks than it is to get bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-12-02 09:18:17
    What made Bitcoin look promising enough for you to buy in / mine?
I had loosely been following Bitcoin since it started to make headlines in about 2012. After doing a lot of research and learning about the fundamentals I became convinced Bitcoin was going to change the world for the better. 
    How was your financial situation beforehand? What was your reaction to the recent price jumps?
Unfortunately I didn't have any money to invest until about May this year, right after the April crash. Because I knew and believed in the fundamentals, I wasn't at all phased by the crash and immediately took the opportunity to start plowing everything I could afford to lose into Bitcoin. While working at a 'real' job, I also traded in the spikes and started holding everything since October. The price is kind of a distraction and the fluctuations don't phase me anymore.
    What does the future of Bitcoin hold for you? Do you plan to stay invested or sell when you feel the price is right?
I have re-invested most of my Bitcoin and profits into Bitcoin related businesses, while I hold a small amount safely as well.
    If more local stores were to accept Bitcoin, which currency do you think you'd use more, Cash or Bitcoin?
Bitcoin. You'll never have to stop by the bank to get cash again. Aside from the many humanitarian advantages Bitcoin will provide, it will also make every-ones lives much more convenient.
    In your opinion, will Bitcoin ever reach the point of being a widespread currency used in most countries?
I think it's probable Bitcoin will, but I also think it's inevitable that another cryptocurrency will if it is not Bitcoin.
    For the most part, it would seem the majority of the Bitcoin community is friendly and generous, why do you think that is?
Most of the current community (early-adopters anyway) believe that Bitcoin has the potential to help the world. They are mostly libertarians and humanitarians (in the West anyway).
    When you first heard about Bitcoin, did you honestly believe anything would come of it?
I was never a nay-sayer. Once I got informed I was convinced something will come of it. Even if Bitcoin fails, the ideas and possibilities that it has revealed will never go away.

I've been involved with Bitcoin for awhile now. In October, I honestly would never have expect the price to be anywhere above $100 today. I'm not really concerned about the price, but I think there's some other data you should consider aside from just the exchange rate.
1) Many more exchanges in multiple countries have opened this year, and many more are set to launch
2) [Number of transactions excluding popular addresses](
3) [Hash Rate (ie. miners supporting and providing security to the infastructure)](
4) [My wallet number of users](
5) Most exchanges currently operating have massive backlogs of verifications, meaning many more new traders/bitcoiners are coming

I'm kind of surprised you have to ask, considering you're a law student and these points have already been discussed (dig a little).
If someone steals gold, what laws apply? If someone steals cash, what laws apply? It's the same thing with Bitcoin. No new regulation needs to be in place. Laundering Bitcoin, just like fiat, is illegal. Theft of anything that you own, is illegal.
The US is going to get left in the dust when it comes to Bitcoin, and it's all because of lawyers.

Indeed it appears to be the same article. The fact that it is on Canada.com is newsworthy though imo.
I don't think you're correct about Bitcoiniacs. I spoke to caVirtex on the phone on Friday and asked them a bunch of questions about their operations and they indicated they are working directly with Bitcoiniacs on the ATM thing.

They would only think they're losing their money if they don't understand the fundamentals. If they invested on the hype so they could get rich quick, then that's that gamble was theirs to take.
The point of the post was really only to laugh at the critics because everyone's attention span surrounding the exchange rate of Bitcoin is based on the 15 min chart.

How are they too expensive for you to afford? If you want gold, you don't have to buy an entire ounce. You can buy a smaller portion - just like with Bitcoin. You can buy as small as 1/10,000,000 of a coin.

You're pretty smart for a Mac owner. I think you're gonna make it ;)
The transaction fee thing will be addressed when bitcoin v1.0 comes out. It's a bit cumbersome now but It's not going to be an issue forever. There are ways around paying that fee as well if you're OK with waiting for long confirmation times. Personally I just pay the miner fee at the moment because I don't mind supporting the miners.
It seems pretty daunting at first. Take baby steps. If you do put in your own money DO NOT invest anything more than you can afford to lose. I believe in bitcoin, however it is still experimental. Remember 56K modems? Connecting to the internet was a process and a half in '94. Things will get better and as you learn the system you will become more confident moving around in it. And bitcoin will evolve and become more user-friendly.
Final note! If you do acquire an amount of bitcoin you do not want stolen, make sure you do some good research on how to secure your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:48:13
The KEY difference is the market availability. As the internet and mobile devices spreads throughout the globe bitcoin will be available to many more people than gold ever will be. Not everyone has the capability to store gold, let alone attain it, but ANYONE can use bitcoin if they so chose WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM GOVERNMENTS OR OTHER PARTIES.
Let's not forget that gold is mostly only valuable AS A STORE OF VALUE and the argument that it has intrinsic value because of industry I would argue accounts for roughly 5% of it's value.
So finally, the argument is: either bitcoin is worth a lot or it is worth 0. So tell me, how much $ will you give me for 1btc?

Brick and mortar stores accepting Bitcoin is only one small part of the potential use for Bitcoin and it's not ready for mass merchant adoption yet anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:06:49
He compared the wrong charts in my opinion.
Compare the USD value with either or both of these:  
One person repeatedly playing Satoshi Dice at 0.00000001฿ could add a lot to the volume disproportionately. Or bots on an exchange could as well. However, the unique addresses, I think, shows a more accurate representation of the user base.
In addition, I think it is important to consider the costs associated with the physical infrastructure that has gone into mining in the past few years and will possibly continue to do so for at least a little longer. Bitcoins have been exchanged at a certain value to buy mining rigs and this has without doubt contributed to the current price and, I believe, will continue to do so moving forward. This could have implications on the whole computing/processing industry if the dream of Bitcoin is realized (dream big!).
And finally, it's also important to consider the value that all the press has added. Bitcoin is not a brand in the sense that no one entity owns it, but interest will, again, without doubt, add to the value and, in my opinion, continue to do so moving forward.
There will be more challenges in the future for Bitcoin, but this honey badger don't give a shit. The proverbial cat is out of the bag. I think the Western institutions will have no choice but to realize the capabilities this technology provides and if they don't jump on the bandwagon, albeit with regulation I wouldn't doubt, they won't be able to compete on the world market. Bitcoin really does have that kind of potential.
Let's also not forget about the China factor and how much the marketplace has diversified (many different exchanges as opposed to just gox). This adds stability, and value, to BTC.
A bubble? Nah, I think we're just getting started. To the moon!
Some other interesting food for thought:   
P.S. This one is also relevant: 
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:48:48

I believe current market value for bitcoin is lower than it should be. Once a realistic value appears, mining will again be profitable. Part of the current upward price push is because of the costs associated with mining, imo. Miners have to sell their mined coins and take a profit which compensates for risk as well.

Generally speaking I don't normally spend a lot of money. I managed to get a decent job recently and have been putting a fair amount into bitcoin as savings. I say savings because I believe in bitcoin. If you don't believe it will succeed you may call it speculation. I do not have many (any?) places locally that take bitcoin, however I have donated a fair amount internationally online. I still have a fair parachute of fiat just in case though.
While I hold a little amount of bitcoin, I have re-invested most of what I have made into bitcoin related companies. If you were speculating, you'd call this 'doubling-down' probably. However, like I said I believe in bitcoin and see the added opportunity of contributing to the bitcoin infrastruction and economy.
When the time and price is right, hopefully I can buy real estate with bitcoin and continue to diversify my portfolio in other areas (LNG, gold, etc).
*Oh I should add that I paid my mom rent in bitcoin. I'm currently staying with her temporarily (moving out tomorrow wooo!) and insisted on giving her some money for utilities and what not. Luckily she's been able to get a close look at what I'm up to and was more than happy to take some bitcoin for free (she would have let me stay for free :) ) Since I gave her that $500 it's quadrupled 8-)

It's much easier to sell the idea that you can get rich to people rather than sell them the idea of a new technology that will benefit the entire world. As you said, once the claws are in, though, they will tend to educate/inform themselves a lot more about their investment.

Is 11% # 1? And no, weather you're buying chipotle lollipops, drugs, or saving it, it still counts to the total 'usage.'
96,000 bitcoins stolen in one day doesn't account for the same amount of bitcoin being used for drug trafficking in a single day. Your math is flawed.
If they were being 'stored' on a drug exchange then by your same logic this doesn't count for daily transactions.
And just because something is illegal in silly little US doesn't mean it's illegal everywhere. And thus we can add politics to the argument.

It's great to have some sort of clarity on this from CRA of all institutions. They seem to not really care about Bitcoin as long as they get their cut. I tried to read through all the legal fine print though and I have absolutely no idea what it means other than they want you to report your income. It would be great to get some clarity about what specifically we need to do if we trade on an exchange. I would assume you have to report income if you cash out your btc for CDN in the same tax year but I would hate to be wrong as I've been formally fucked by CRA before and would not like it repeated.
That being said, this is great news for BTC in Canada I think, just might have to hire an accountant for my taxes! Argh!

I've also set up a few friends with Bitcoin, payed my mom some rent (while I stayed with her for a month, I insisted!). She's saving (hoarding?) it and it's almost quadrupled in value since I gave it to her.
That should be enough to get your started! Congrats on having the balls and open mind to do this Matt.
I should add that I never exchange my Bitcoin back for fiat (and probably never will). Whenever I think the exchange rate is outpacing the 'true' value, I donate some of my Bitcoin profits to charities (when it will do the most good!).

I'm not involved with Bitcoin to get rich, although it might be a welcome side effect. If you have Bitcoin to get rich, it WILL fuck with your head. Some of the wealthiest people with Bitcoin, such as Roger Ver, don't give a shit about the exchange rate and [he donated $1m just last month]( He doesn't trade, all he does is hold. Take a lesson from him and [Erik Voorhees]( These are some of the most intelligent people you will ever know in the world of Bitcoin.
One thing a lot of people forget to consider when they're trading Bitcoin is that mr. Taxman is going to want his cut. If you hold you ain't gotta give up shit. I should add that, while I do have some Bitcoin holdings, most of my previous Bitcoin investments from months ago has been put towards Bitcoin startups.
Honestly, trading and speculating is the worst way to try to make gains in Bitcoin. Days like today (and this post) are proof of that.

And most of that was donated this month when Bitcoin was seeing all time highs over and over. So I'm sorry this hoarding thing is just a fallacy.

I've been trading on virtex for almost a year and I have an invested interest in bitcoin and some canadian bitcoin businesses. Robocoin is from the US and I would imagine he trades on a US exchange because it is harder to deal with international money transfers so most people like to use something local. Also, Virtex does charge some fees which I think are reasonable considering the amount of risk and energy they've put in to paving the way for this in Canada. They have been key in dialogue with Canadian regulators to get clarity about legalities and a big reason ATMs are going into Canada and not the US right now is for this reason. It is completely legal in Canada and the gvt has taken a fairly clear stance. In the US... not so much.

1) You should not store your bitcoins on an exchange. If you're going to leave them somewhere inactive for 6 months they should be in cold storage.
2) There are operational reasons to have this fee such as exchanges only carry a certain 'float' of btc to satisfy the trade demand and keep the majority in cold storage. Having inactive accounts with funds in it creates more risk by need of having more btc in a float.
3) The ATM is directly linked to the Virtex exchange. 
4) I've been using them for almost a year and don't have many complaints. New people interested in investing have to understand that the demand has outgrown certain infastructure that many bitcoin businesses are working swiftly to upgrade.
You are welcome to look for yourself but they claim to be registered in Calgary (I've spoken to one of their associates recently regarding the debit cards they provide).

Thanks for your help! I think I understand, but what if you exchange multiple times. For example, if I invested $1000 into 10 btc, then through trades back and forth end up with 12 btc for that tax year. Could I claim a loss of $1000 for that year. Then the following year I sell 12 btc and get $10,000 I'm assuming then I would claim a capital gain of $10,000 for that year?
Or would I have to claim a gain every time I traded?
Thanks again! Yeah Canada xD

For some odd reasons I was thinking of this QR tattoo as well and just had the epiphany of temporary tattoos for the QR code itself (as you said you did as well). Who knows what the market is, but you could probably start charging to put temporary QR tattoos on as well ;).
Permanent tattoo frame = $(rate)/hr
Temporary QR tattoo = $10 (or whatever)
edit: The temp QR thing came from a realization that a permanent QR would be 1)retarded and 2) hard to get right the first time?
disclaimer: I know nothing about tattooing aside from I have some and they hurt. Also I want moar.

I remember when I used to get on the internet by plugging a phone wire into a 56K modem in the back of my Win 3.1 desktop with 256mb of RAM. Some pages took so long to load, I could go make a sandwich and it would still be loading when I got back. Downloading a 3mb MP3 (an audio compression invented to solve this hideous bandwidth issue) took hours to complete, and if someone tried calling me at any time they got a busy tone.
SUCH A HASSLE. But man, those were the pioneer days! I feel old now... hold me.

[OH MY WHAT SPIN! Same news without all the FUD!](
Digital currencies are not officially recognized as legitimate by the Chinese government. Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China said that it would be "impossible for China's central bank to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument in the near future" at a forum last Wednesday.
But Yi also added that people are free to participate in the bitcoin market. And he thinks the idea of bitcoin is interesting and would personally keep an eye on the currency from a long-term perspective.
The remark is seen as a positive sign. And as its popularity grew, shops and companies are starting to accept bitcoin for payment. Baidu, the leading search engine in China, now accepts the currency for certain services.

Might be on the wrong thought train if you're comparing bitcoin to your experiences owning stocks in a company.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:55:26
He compared the wrong charts in my opinion.
Compare the USD value with either or both of these:
One person repeatedly playing Satoshi Dice at 0.00000001฿ could add a lot to the volume disproportionately. Or bots on an exchange could as well. However,  the unique addresses, I think,  shows a more accurate representation of the user base.
In addition, I think it is important to consider the costs associated with the physical infrastructure that has gone into mining in the past few years and will possibly continue to do so for at least a little longer. Bitcoins have been exchanged at a certain value to buy mining rigs and this has without doubt contributed to the current price and, I believe, will continue to do so moving forward. This could have implications on the whole computing/processing industry if the dream of Bitcoin is realized (dream big!).
And finally, it's also important to consider the value that all the press has added. Bitcoin is not a brand in the sense that no one entity owns it, but interest will, again, without doubt, add to the value and, in my opinion, continue to do so moving forward.
There will be more challenges in the future for Bitcoin, but this honey badger don't give a shit. The proverbial cat is out of the bag. I think the Western institutions will have no choice but to realize the capabilities this technology provides and if they don't jump on the bandwagon, albeit with regulation I wouldn't doubt, they won't be able to compete on the world market. Bitcoin really does have that kind of potential.
Some other interesting food for thought:

We're getting confused somewhere. Ideally your public address can be seen (even though it's more secure if you don't advertise it) and your private key will give access to the account. Therefore you really don't want your private key to ever see the internet or a potentially compromised computer. Like I said, ideally BOTH your public ADDRESS and private KEY, but at least your key...
If you're using a wallet on your phone and your phone is saving the key to the phone then you might want to think about doing a paper/cold storage wallet for any amount that you don't want stolen.

I encourage everyone to listen to the whole video. Bobby Lee is enthusiastic about the rest of the clarification regarding Bitcoin including the approval by the government of exchanges such as BTC China.
Bitcoin hasn't been used and wasn't being bought by many Chinese in order to buy goods and services - that market does not exist in China at this point (even before the statement by the government). Bobby Lee goes on to talk about how China is a nation of savers and many people there are buying Bitcoin and using it as a store of value (such as a commodity like gold), and the government has given the go-ahead for its use in this fashion. It's also important to note, as Bobby Lee did, that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon and there's nothing really stopping Chinese people from using their Bitcoin to purchase things in other countries where it is legal to do so.
In addition, Bitcoin IS NOT ready for mass merchant adoption. There are many uses for Bitcoin which add value (which Bobby Lee goes over in detail). Bitcoin needs to (and will) see a natural evolution over time and will not go from 10 billion market cap to its full potential overnight, nor would that be healthy or sustainable (ie. infrastructure, legislation, public awareness). The truth is, it is not going to really be viable for much of the world to start accepting Bitcoin en-mass until the volatility comes way down. This will happen when the market cap is much more (after some financial instruments have been built around Bitcoin, which I believe we will see starting in the US in 2014.
Posting just the small, negative part of the whole conversation clearly demonstrates the bias and/or fear of the OP (**Redditor for 8 Days**). If you're invested in Bitcoin it is your obligation to make your own informed decisions. If you make your decisions based on any Reddit post without fully informing yourself then you should not be directly involved in investing in Bitcoin.

I started trading btc in April. I have definitely had a net gain from trading overall. At this point in time, the only btc I might ever convert back to my local currency is the dividends I'm anticipating from when btc reaches its true value (as compared to USD). The cycle has been broken, me thinks.

1.7% comes pretty close to  in your books I guess. And saving your btc is still 'using' them to store value.
