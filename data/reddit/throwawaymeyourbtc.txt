If you complete the simple, basic task of upgrading to the newest official firmware when the unit is new to you then it will either a) not properly install, thus demonstrating that you can not use the unit, or b) install properly and wipe whatever was there before. Again, if a hardware wallet relies on the trust of the manufacturer or distributor it is USELESS.  No one is to be trusted when it comes to crypto.

I’m confused.  Did I miss the unveiling of Kleiman and/or Wright as Satoshi, or is this whole court case begging the question?

By systemwide I mean across nearly all asset classes, like we saw in 2008.  Though my guess is the next one will be far more destructive.  Historically, the greater the leverage employed in any asset class, the more value vaporizes in a crash.   
I also disagree that crypto as a safe haven has been even remotely priced in yet.  It’s barely a 10-year old technology.  I doubt even 1% of the population owns crypto as a safe haven asset, and of the minuscule number of funds and institutions investing in bitcoin they’re surely classifying it as the diametric opposite of a safe haven asset.  People and their short memories have moved on after the Great Recession and most wont even consider crypto as a safe haven option until it performs as one.  It hasn’t even had that opportunity yet.
Sounds like you might view markets from a different time and goal perspective than I do and that’s fine.  See you on the other side of a few trades...
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:11:39
What do you think he was trying to accomplish?  Did he just choose a dead person off the Satoshi suspects list and cook up the whole story to take credit for the project, and this lawsuit was an unanticipated reaction from the family of CSW’s unwitting accomplice?
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:47:28
 I personally see it as a sound and proven concept as well, but we’re in the minority there.  
I think there are also facets of bitcoin that we haven’t even discovered yet.  New tech will come along and drive even more demand.  
The only thing I’m absolutely certain about with bitcoin is that a decade from now it will either be worth zero, or many times what it is worth today.  I’ve been saying that since 2011 and each year the latter option seems to be more and more likely.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:34:29
I still disagree.  I’d wager that the overall leverage in the crypto market would barely even register on a graph of the leverage in other asset classes.  A handful of crypto day traders on a smaller handful of platforms isn’t going to impact price discovery remotely the same as the more established markets.
ETA: Additionally, I’d bet that a tiny fraction of the overall value of owned bitcoin is not owned outright.  We have plenty of volatility for plenty of reasons, but not the pressure of margin calls or inability to cover debt service on one’s crypto.  In a systemwide crash most people can hold, unless they have to sell crypto to cover other losses.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:33:42
If this article scares you, but you want to explore the coming cataclysm in more detail, I recommend “The Breaking Point,” by James Dale Davidson.  I read an excerpt from one of his earlier books that described cryptocurrencies in detail 15 years prior to their existence, so I bought “The Breaking Point.”  His predictions for the world economy, and the US in particular, are nothing short of dystopian.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:07:31

@_date: 2019-08-27 20:16:28
Even that name, “The Tulip Trust” seems to disprove his claims.  I mean, it’s a little on the nose, isn’t it?  Are we to believe that two computer scientists are working on this huge, groundbreaking project and they are prescient enough to joke that some day it might be compared to Tulip mania?  To me it sounds more like something someone would pull out of their ass when backdating a few legal documents.

Think financial controls and AML laws.  This is just another instance of big banks having a direct connection with the world’s worst criminals.  The reason they buy it is precisely because the gold is worth the same as long as it is legit, and I’d bet they get these at a discount for some explainable but false reason.

This guy is the biggest piece of shit of all time.  If it ever came out that—gag—he was even a part of the development of bitcoin I think it might make me lose a little love for BTC.  Fortunately, that doesn’t appear to be a problem.

How do you figure that?  Is there someplace I can buy bitcoin on margin or buy it with 0-10% down?  Do you think the options markets are even remotely as developed for bitcoin vs other assets?

Just because it was “gold backed” doesn’t mean we had the gold to back it.  The US was able to print more fiat than they could cover at face value, but it took decades for people to notice because not everyone wanted their gold at the same time.  Kind of like a Ponzi scheme.

It’s “Kleiman,” but I’m with you in your assessment.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:20:56
It’s fun to think that,  but it’s going to be extremely difficult for the Kleiman estate to collect anything on this judgement.  Also, debts pass to one’s estate, but not personally to their heirs.

Yes, exactly.  It would require more adjudication, but he’d be tee’d up and would have a very strong chance of prevailing.  
For the record, however, I agree with the comment above that CSW took advantage of a dead man and is now dealing with the fallout.

You’re probably referring to a language called Esperanto.  It’s been around for over 100 years and almost no one speaks it.  It was a good concept, but in the end the universal language will continue to be English.

OTOH, if it were to turn out that Dave Kleiman actually was Satoshi Nakamoto and his family stumbled over the keys to the 1.1 million BTC in Dave’s old highschool yearbook or something, CSW may have just entitled himself to half.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:04:01
Yes, it can make toast.  The term “scam” in reference to BCH is referring to the motivations and the methods of the people behind the fork.  However, if for some reason you researched it and decided you prefer BCH’s protocol, you can safely buy it and use it without fear of having your coins stolen by the developers.  The biggest risk is market forces driving down the price.  Someone may try to correct me and say you can lose your coins through a 51% attack or something, but that’s a completely different issue and falls under the category of “reasons BCH’s protocol isn’t as good as BTC.”
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:41:12
Thanks for your posts.  Kleiman is my personal top suspect as Satoshi.

There is a line between bullion coins and numismatics.  US gold buffaloes were sold by the Us mint as billion, but they became popular and now sell for many multiples of spot, falling in a category between billion and full numismatic value.  The same has occurred with many other contemporary mintages.  The Australian Gold Lunar series is another good example.

“Bitcoin” does no marketing so by definition it can not be a marketing ploy.  Because one altcoin chooses to cloak itself in a bitcoin suit (as a marketing ploy) doesn’t transitively imply that bitcoin is a ploy also, just that bitcoin is more popular.

What a fucking prick Wright is.  If the trust exists why would he fight his partner’s estate to usurp what is rightfully theirs.  It is either more proof that the trust doesn’t exist, or more proof that he’s one of the slimiest humans to ever exist.

And you have to remember that the reason Nixon nixed the gold standard was most likely because we’d printed too much fiat to ever actually have the capacity to repay the face value in gold.  I believe France was a’knockin’ for their gold, we didn’t have it, so Nixon was like, “sorry, gold window’s closed...forever.”

This again, huh?
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:49:28
I’ll check it out.  All I can figure is that CSW is really confident that Kleiman was Satoshi, or CSW just picked someone from the Satoshi suspect list who was dead so he could work a little photoshop magic and weave a narrative of himself being Satoshi, not foreseeing that the family of his pasty (for lack of a better word) might also be interested in the story he was telling.

I think what they were saying is that gold that is shady af is being melted down and passed off as gold from within the acceptable system.  Like blood diamonds being snuck through legitimate channels to appear respectable.  In This case the implication being that major banks are possibly linked to some of the worst of the worst in human behavior.  Which, no shit....
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:33:37
I hear that a lot, but I’m not qualified to personally make that determination.  There’s also the “I am not Dorian Nakamoto”  comment which was posted after Kleiman’s death.  He’s still on my personal shortlist, but I hate the idea because it implies that CSW actually had some degree of involvement.  
I think someone flagged my post for removal for being “off-topic” and you must have posted prior to that happening and looked back after the removal.  I suppose it could be argued that this conversation is more appropriate to play out in the comments of any of the numerous news posts...

This post appears to be just you and me at this point, so I don’t think you have downvotes to fear.  I’ve read all the same information and I don’t disagree that it looked bad, the problem is that the source of  information portraying Ross effectively as a murderer is a DOJ that has repeatedly proven their willingness to be deceitful for their own ends, numerous members of law enforcement have been fired or imprisoned for corruption directly linked to the case, and the overall narrative was twisted by the government due to their sheer terror over this new creation we now know as dark net markets.  Those are plenty of reasons for me to insist on due process before I’ll put any stock in the multiple-murder-for-hire-but-no-actual-murders spiel.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:49:44
I don’t think there’s anything I disagree with you about enough to try to refute.  He probably earned a prison sentence, though if I were king he wouldn’t be incarcerated.  I do still personally consider him to be a good guy.
I take major issue with people who lean on the murder for hire stuff because of the reasons I already shared.  As you point out, even those serious charges would typically warrant a much shorter sentence than he received.  And if they had been proved in court I’d agree he should be in prison.  Based on the govt’s claims, they basically had him dead to rights both federally and in Maryland. The fact it wasn’t charged is suspect.  Also, I’ve personally been lied about in the news by prosecutors for far less, so my experience inclines me to call bullshit. 
That said, the chat logs do seem to require one to at least consider the fact that he was involved with at least one of those schemes.  Again, if so, it’s absolutely the worst thing he did in my view and he should do time.  I’m not willing to judge his entire character on those speculations, though, even if I assume them to be correct.  Obviously not everyone will agree with me, but I think good people do horrible things sometimes and can still be considered to be generally good people. At least give him good, but with an asterisk.
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:55:19
Here we go again.  He was never charged with that.  Not “he was never convicted,” he was never charged.  Prosecutors claimed they had fucking TRANSCRIPTS, he was never charged.  You may believe everything the government, prosecutors in particular, say.  I absolutely do not.  I’ve seen the shady vilification tactics they use firsthand.
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:25:45
This is basically the same as the issue of precious metals prices being manipulated down via various forms of paper ownership vs physical ownership.  The difference is that the supply and current location of precious metals is opaque while bitcoin supply is extremely transparent, so the market will be as easily manipulated.
