Ballmer is a marketing/sales guy, not a developer. It wasn't his job to fully understand Linux. And the GPL at the time was hopelessly vague and poorly-worded, so he can't really be faulted for misinterpreting it as a direct attack on private-source commercial software, especially when Richard Stallman (architect of the GPL) had been extremely vocal about his disdain for private-source software.
Also, *The Register* always had a distinct anti-Microsoft slant, so their interpretation of Ballmer's comments was always going to be biased.

The new Coinbase API system lets you assign multiple API keys with different sets of permissions on your account. So you can issue an API key that only has permission to buy/sell BTC, but has no permission to send BTC anywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:05:20
This doesn't use your API keys; it uses OAuth, and it only requests permission to buy or sell BTC and view your balance, not to send BTC.

You don't think that a) Coinbase wouldn't notice what's happening and revoke the app's API keys, and b) go after the app developer to recover the stolen funds? You can't put apps on the store anonymously. The developer works at airbnb, for Christ's sake.
Some of you guys are just way too paranoid.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:33:03
It doesn't want your API key; it uses OAuth to authenticate with Coinbase.  It only requests the minimum set of permissions required to do its job (Buy/Sell BTC, view transactions and balance.) The biggest harm it could possibly do is trigger a gigantic BTC buy, which would potentially empty my bank account (which would mess up my cashflow for a while, but I wouldn't actually lose much since I'd have that value in BTC instead, minus Coinbase buy fees.)

@_date: 2014-06-20 15:26:43
This post is way too paranoid. Some counterpoints:
* This app uses the Coinbase API. The Coinbase API has a very small potential attack surface--the only truly dangerous thing it lets developers do is send Bitcoins to a given address, and that capability is guarded by both a user-controlled daily limit *and* independent verification from Coinbase (via SMS or phone call to the contact number on your Coinbase account, which the API does not provide).
* The App Store does not allow anonymous developers. At a minimum, you need a major credit card to pay for a Developer account in order to publish apps. Furthermore, the developer works for AirBnb. If the developer tried anything nefarious and stole people's Bitcoins, it would be remarkably easy to find him, prosecute him and recover the stolen funds. He has a lot to lose and not very much to gain.
I understand that a healthy level of paranoia is prudent when dealing with Bitcoin, but five seconds of thought should assuage anyone's concerns in this case.

1. No-one advocates for an unregulated currency. Bitcoin enthusiasts are fine with currency regulation, as long as the regulation is *fair*, *consistent* and *transparent.* No other fiat or virtual currency that I know of meets all of those criteria.

The last time TD Bank had a two-day outage like this, it was because they were deploying a brand-new version of their Online Banking web and mobile apps. New backend and everything. You'll still be able to do banking stuff during the downtime by going into a branch or using an ATM.
Normal maintenance happens every night for a couple of hours. This isn't normal maintenance. This is the equivalent of a major Bitcoin node provider taking all of their nodes offline to deploy a major update. If you rely on that node to broadcast your transactions, and you don't have a good connection to any other node, then you'll have to wait.
Bitcoin is still small enough that concepts like "major node providers" are still foreign to it. But if it does get as big as we would presumably all like it to, such a concept will very likely become a thing, the way we have major Internet backbone providers. When a major backbone provider has problems (which isn't unheard of), then suddenly large parts of the internet become unavailable to certain people. The same thing may happen if a "major node provider" goes down.

New bitcoins are issued with every block, calibrated to occur approximately every ten minutes.
The amount of new bitcoins is based on a schedule. Approximately every 5 years (210,000 blocks), the amount is cut in half.
Today, every new block issues 12.5btc. In about 3 years, that number will be cut to 6.25btc. 5-ish years after that, the number will be cut again, to 3.125btc. This will continue indefinitely, until it's down to a single Satoshi, and then zero, sometime around the year 2140.

So here's the thing: Bitcoin is supposed to be private. But the blockchain is a matter of public record. That's a problem, because if you send me money, I will know that the address I received it from belongs to you, and I could then trawl through the blockchain looking for other transactions involving your address. With enough resources, I could easily build a data-mining operation to unmask the owners of every address, thereby destroying the private nature of Bitcoin.    Bitcoin wallets solve this problem in a couple of ways. When you run the software and create a new wallet, the client will create at least 100 Bitcoin addresses. It will only show you a handful of these addresses; the others are kept hidden. You can reveal them if you wish by hitting the "New Receive Address" button, which will show them to you one at a time.The wallet protects your privacy by ensuring that each address is only used for a single outgoing transaction. That way, the people you send money to can't data-mine the blockchain trying to find out who *else* you send money to. So when you send money, it figures out which combination of addresses has the required number of Bitcoins and empties them all out. Of course emptying out all those addresses will provide more money than was requested, so the excess Bitcoins are deposited into another of your secret addresses, ready for the next transaction.What happened here is that you tried to send 0.5 btc, but the secret addresses used for the transaction had a total of 0.64490001 btc in them. They were emptied out, 0.5 btc was sent to your recipient, and the remainder was returned to one of your secret addresses.The wallet software keeps track of the balance in these secret addresses, but when you go check the transaction on the blockchain, it looks weird.

Here's my method for generating a brainwallet passphrase:
I went to a random city block and took the names of all the stores on that block (about a dozen stores). To that, I added a word composed of the first letters of the words in a sentence I use all the time, but is not associated with me.
In case I forget the store names, I shot a video of the block that I keep on my SkyDrive. Since it's a video, it's impossible to extract the store names. Furthermore, it's unlikely that anyone who saw the video would understand its significance.
Is that good enough for a brainwallet passphrase?

For small, incidental purchases, there's no need to wait for confirmations. Online Bitcoin payment processors already process transactions without waiting for confirmations.For larger, planned purchases, Bitcoin offers a way to pre-authorize a transaction on the blockchain for more than what you intend to spend, get that transaction confirmed, then once your purchases are complete, adjust the amount of that transaction to the final cost of the items without waiting for confirmation.So the confirmation time really isn't an issue.

I have a problem with the bolded part. If an attacker is mining on a private chain which no-one else has seen, the probability that they'll discover the next block cannot be expressed in terms of the public mining network. The probability that the attacker finds the next block in the private chain will always be 1, because *no-one else is mining on that chain*.

Bitcoin Mining Pools are groups of miners who pool their computing power. If anyone in the pool finds a block (and therefore gets the block reward), everyone in the pool gets a share of the block reward, proportional to the amount of computing power they contributed towards finding that block. 
They are appealing to miners because they offer more consistent revenue over time compared to going it alone. As a lone miner, you might find a block once a year and get to keep the block reward for yourself, but as part of a pool, you get a little money anytime anyone in the pool finds a block, which could be several times a day. It's a lot like an office lottery pool.
BTC Guild is the largest Bitcoin Mining Pool, with 42% of Bitcoin's global mining power in the hands of its members. That means BTC Guild's organizers (indirectly) control approximately 42% of all new Bitcoins issued. This potentially puts them in a position to wield enormous power over the currency, though realistically, the ease with which a miner can switch pools will prevent BTC Guild from doing anything truly nefarious.

I think using the blockchain/proof-of-work system to secure elections would only really make sense if we didn't have a first-past-the-post voting system.
In any case, here's how I see a blockchain/proof-of-work election working:
1. During the voter registration phase, a new Votecoin wallet is established for every voter that registers. Note that the wallet is not *assigned* to the voter, but it *is* assigned to the voter's *district.*
2. At the conclusion of the voter registration phase, all the wallets are seeded with one VTC, and the public/private keypairs are printed in the form of QR codes on scratch-off cards. These scratch-off cards are kept closely guarded.
3. On election day, voters turn up at their polling places and sign in, but instead of receiving a ballot sheet, they receive an un-scratched scratch-off card.
4. Voters can either vote with their smartphones, or use a voting booth. In either case, the voter would scratch off the card, revealing the QR code and their voter wallet ID in plaintext. Snap a pic of the QR code to enter the keypair, then create a transaction that sends VTC to the wallets of each candidate they wish to vote for. Said wallet IDs would be publicized well in advance, posted conspicuously throughout the polling place and in the app.
Voting is not complete until all VTC in each voter's wallet is spent.
5. Voters receive a receipt detailing the transaction they created, including their wallet ID and transaction ID. They can look at the blockchain and check to make sure their transaction was properly posted and confirmed. They can choose to keep the receipt and scratch-off card, or they can choose to dispose of them. Whatever they need.
6. After the polls close, the candidate with the most VTC in their wallet is declared the winner.

Armory allows you to create a wallet on a machine that is never connected to the internet; you use it solely to sign transactions created on a different machine.
You use an online machine to track the balance of that wallet and create transactions from it, but before you can broadcast those transactions, you have to sign them by copying the transaction file to the offline machine with a USB stick, signing the transaction offline, then copying the signed transaction back to the online machine for broadcast.
The offline wallet is seeded with a key which you write down on paper and safeguard as one of your most important valuables. Your private keys never reside on a machine with an Internet connection. If your private keys are lost, the paper seed will allow you to regenerate them easily. Hell, thanks to the paper seed, you never even have to worry about keeping private keys around; just regenerate them on the occasions you want to spend them.
This is super-secure for your most valuable wallets; an attacker would have to physically get their hands on your paper seed in order to create transactions with the bitcoins in that wallet. For the even-more paranoid, you can do things to obfuscate the paper seed; ROT13 is easy to remember, or some sort of keyboard-based off-by-one cipher. Or maybe you create your own seed using the colors of the houses on your block or something.

It's cute how you think that public access to the source code automatically makes it more secure.  
  
In the real world, open source projects have maintainers who control everything that gets checked in to the source. The public can collaborate and do whatever they want; the only people who have any control over the source code are the maintainers. If the maintainers accept bad or insecure code, then the project is going to be insecure, no matter how many eyes look at it or how many hands touch it.  
  
Or the project gets forked, adding to the confusion. Which fork is more secure than the other? Which maintainers are more security-focused? Are there bad actors purposefully checking in flawed code? Who audits the code? Do you trust the auditors? Have you audited the source code yourself?  
  
Bottom line, open source or not, you have no fucking clue. You just trust the maintainers and auditors to do the right thing. People who might very well be doing this in their spare time while holding down 9-to-5 jobs (because unless they're part of the Mozilla or Linux Foundations, they sure as hell aren't getting rich maintaining their rinky-dink open source projects.)  
  
I am not saying Open Source is bad. But lets stop with the automatic assumption that open source code is always more secure than closed source code. It is a retarded and simplistic assumption to make, and it has no basis in reality, only in asinine half-baked theory.

User-approved privilege escalation is a vital security feature of *every modern operating system*. Windows' implementation (UAC) happens to be the most user-friendly (because it doesn't force you to enter a password like other OSes do) and informative (because it shows authenticode information in the escalation prompt, which other OSes do not) implementation of this feature.
There is *no good reason* to disable it. If you aren't using it, *you are a moron* and should be kept far away from any computer.

I supposed I could have been clearer. Yeah, the initial pre-auth assigns the funds to the target wallet only.
And yeah, you do need to know the recipient's address, but you'd need to know that in any case. The store could post it near the door as you walk in, or on its website or something.

I don't think it's necessary to enable 2-factor support *everywhere*. Use it for online wallets in which you carry a lot of value. But I wouldn't bother using it with wallets you use for pocket change or day-to-day spending cash.
I maintain a wallet on Blockchain.info that I use for walking-around money--around 0.3BTC or so. I don't put 2-factor authentication on it, just a relatively strong password.
My Coinbase wallet, on the other hand, gets 2-factor authentication because it's where I buy my Bitcoins, and it routinely holds large sums. For that, I use Authy SMS so I don't have to worry about losing the Google Authenticator shared secret.
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:36:48

When you use the Electrum installer on Windows, the first thing it does is show a UAC privilege-escalation request that shows the name of the developer who signed it. If there is no digital signature, you get a yellow box saying the developer is unidentified. If the digital signature is invalid, you will get a red warning, and it will take a non-trivial series of steps to continue the installation. You must acknowledge the box before the installation will continue.
Electrum's installer is unsigned, so you get a yellow warning box telling you the developer is unidentified.

If you are going to do a brain wallet or paper wallet, *make sure the seed is strong enough!*
This is vital. Do *not*, under *any* circumstances use a seed passphrase that would turn up in a Google search. Don't use song lyrics, famous quotes, anything like that.
Ideally, you should use [Diceware]( to generate your seed phrase, making it as long as you feel you can comfortably remember.
The reason for this is simple. If anyone else is using the same seed phrase as you, they will have access to your wallet. There are people out there who have vast dictionaries of possible seed phrases, with access to dozens of addresses generated from those seeds. If your seed matches one of theirs and you put money in that wallet, they'll swipe that cash within seconds.

Yes it does. Changing the shipping address or payment method for a pre-order results in the pre-order being cancelled automatically. It's designed to prevent fraud and people circumventing pre-order purchase limits.
Amazon has tightened this policy in recent weeks such that you can't even pre-pay for the order using Amazon gift cards.
In some cases, Amazon customer service reps can change the pre-order without cancelling it, but that is at their discretion.

The merchant can send back a timeboxed transaction that will be invalid after *x* days.

The mining pool server sends each miner the transaction list (including the "block reward" transaction that assigns new coins to the mining pool owner's wallet) and a range of nonces (a 'nonce' is a random number added to the end of the transaction list before the block hash is calculated; the act of mining involves repeatedly hashing the transaction list using different nonces, until a valid hash is found.)
The miner takes the transaction list and the range of nonces and goes to work, hashing the transaction list over and over and over again, one nonce at a time, until it finds a valid hash, it runs out of nonces or the mining pool server tells it to stop (presumably because it received word that someone else found a valid hash.) If it runs out of nonces, it sends back the hashes it calculated and asks the mining pool server for more.
The mining pool server knows how many hashes each miner contributed, and that's how a miner's contribution is calculated.

It involves "micropayment" transactions. You can post a transaction to the block chain that "pre-authorizes" a certain amount to be given to the recipient; this transaction will deduct the specified amount from your wallet balance, but will not add it to the target wallet. This transaction takes the standard amount of time to post and confirm.
Once the preauthorized transaction is confirmed, you can post any number of transactions that push some or all of the preauthorized amount into the destination wallets. These transactions are *instant* and don't have to be broadcast or confirmed.
After a set amount of time, the unspent balance returns to the originating addresses (which is also instant, because it's covered by the initial transaction.)
It's basically escrow, with the blockchain as the trusted third party. But the idea is if you know you're going to be shopping at a certain store, you can preauthorize enough to cover your purchases before you leave home (or as you enter the store), the preauth will confirm as you shop, and at checkout, you provide final authorization for the amount of your purchase, which is instant.
This is all supported in the protocol today.

Ah, the "Open Source = security" argument, and its corollary, the "Windows is 'closed source' therefore it is insecure" argument.
Neither argument holds any water under  close examination, but they feel good to the Linux fanboys, so they get trotted out over and over again.
In the real world, source code access has an extremely small impact on the security of an application. As has been demonstrated numerous times, security researchers are perfectly capable of identifying vulnerabilities in an application, whether or not they have access to its source code. In addition, Microsoft makes Windows source code available to numerous interested and qualified third parties, who rigorously audit it for potential security vulnerabilities.
In the real world, Microsoft is one of the most disciplined and rigorous companies at developing secure software, and this is borne out in study after study.

Nope. Coinbase holds your money for about a week, then fills your BTC order at the then-current rate.  
  
So if you place an order today for 2 BTC when the price is ~$120, they'll take ~$240, wait until next Friday, then give you however many BTC you can get for ~$240. If the price has gone up, that means you get less than 2 BTC.

Mining will still be profitable because the price of Bitcoin and the volume of transactions will rise as the currency grows.  
  
And mining profitability is self-calibrating; the less profitable it is, the fewer people will do it, leading to reduced difficulty, leading to increased profitability.

I just chatted with an Amazon customer service rep to confirm this.
Changing the payment or shipping details will not cancel the order, but it will set it back in the fulfillment queue; it will be as if the original pre-order was placed "today", so to speak.
So while the console will still be delivered, the change could cause it not to be delivered on release day.
I apologize for the confusion.
