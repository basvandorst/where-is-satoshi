That helps, didn't know nonces had to be valid

I guess I got a head of myself, the nonces depend on the hash of the previous blocks so in order to add other blocks, all of my nonces would have to be recalculated

What if I wanted to insert some premined blocks into the chain, so I verify the current block and then add my own blocks and then just broadcast the new blocks to the honest nodes?

I agree, it's hard enough to get users to contribute to fund development, It might be hard to solicit trustless fundraising. To be honest though, with out a presence in Washington crypto will be held back

Yea I agree, I really need under $325 ETH so I waited but it keeps going up. I don't know if I should go in on ETH or BTC

It's a really easy solution, Apple has enough money to lobby, they have politicians on their payroll. So do banks, the financial sector has some of the biggest lobbies. Right now crypto is just a thorn in their shoe - all their CEO has to do is call us a fraud and the market drops. What I'm worried about is when crypto starts to threaten the banks then we will see them start to really lobby, banks will join with other banks and create lobby groups.
So what Apple is doing isn't illegal, they have enough lobbying power to keep it that way. Crypto doesn't even have enough lobbying power to get a law passed for a Bitcoin tax exemption for everyday purchases
