I have a countless amount of friends who have always been very dismissive of Bitcoin. Last year, since the cryptocurrency markets grew a lot, many of them started investing. They still think it's all a scam, but they invest because of the returns.
If my friends are descriptive of the general population investing in alt-coins, it means that the alt-coin markets are full of weak hands. The weak hands want to get out as soon as the value drops and there are no longer gains to be made. There's a lot of weak hands in Bitcoin, too, but I'd argue it's several magnitudes less.
Just as the picture tries to communicate, any alt-coin doesn't provide anything Bitcoin wouldn't (except for centralization and censorship, in case you prefer that).

Thanks for sharing your calculations. I'd really like to see upvote original research from current time over tweets and posts from Bitcoin early days.
I want to comment on your analysis that I think the biggest problem for scalability is not the block size, but rather the UTXO set size. Bitcoin works so that you only once pay for the transaction, and after that your UTXO's have to be stored until you spend them, or for eternity if you never spend. Lot's of optimizations are constantly landing to bitcoin-core for nodes to process the UTXO set faster, but if the transactions would be too cheap, the UTXO set size would still blow up and nodes would have a hard time validating transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:59:53
I disagree. To me, Bitcoin is not about challenging governments, but rather challenging the monetary politics.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:54:31
Note that full nodes are NOT required to store the whole blockchain for all eternity. In the long-term, all nodes will most likely be pruning old blocks. Full nodes need to store some new blocks (say last 1 year), but most importantly, they need the whole UTXO set in order to validate new transactions.
This works already now, with the exception of bootstrapping new nodes. New nodes have to build the UTXO set from scratch, and they do that by downloading the full blockchain. In the future blocks will most likely contain a hash validating the UTXO set, and that will make it possible to bootstrap a new node without downloading the whole blockchain.

"Smart contracts" is just a buzzword coined to scam noobs out of their money. Since the dawn of Bitcoin, it has had a built-in programming language. It is a very versatile language that can be used as a base to build higher layer protocols. For example, Lightning Network works exactly like that.
As for changes into Bitcoin consensus rules: it is by design that it is difficult to change them. This design provides political decentralization, resilience and ultimately trust in the network.

If we get Schnorr signatures, will it fix the UTXO consolidation cost for you? (i.e. fee would be constant regardless of how many UTXO's are spent)

For millennia, we had exactly that. The current system has existed merely decades.

No need for an alt-coin when Bitcoin is going to solve the very exact same problem.
If you disagree, you are free to post your opinions on or @_date: 2018-01-02 21:54:23
Thanks for the high quality references. Based on that bitcointalk.org post it looks like my understanding was flawed; the size of the transaction would not be constant with an increased amount of input UTXO's, but rather


compared to the equivalent transaction without using signature aggregation.

You get the discount when sending *from* a segwit type address.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:06:12
My understanding is that the witness part in SegWit type "addresses" has a discount, because they have no impact on the UTXO set. If you run a full node in pruning mode, you need to store only some latest blocks + the UTXO set.

To validate all transactions, you need to know all UTXO's.

So, you are saying that every time someone comes up with a new idea we should have a new alt-coin? What a nice feature for a currency that a new currency might pop up at any time making your old one worthless.
Fuck, it's because of trolls like you I wish moderators would still "censor" alt-coin shills. You are not here to discuss Bitcoin. You are here to promote alt-coins.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:16:25
It's easy to bitch on reddit, but harder to come up with real solutions. A simple blocksize increase it not the final solution by any means. Not only are hard forks painful, but moreover if we always hard fork to a bigger blocksize when fees grow, the UTXO set will blow up. Remember that the UTXO's have to be stored on all nodes for all eternity (until spent).
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:33:37
You need to open channels or otherwise you aren't really running a node. To open channels you need bitcoin that you can lock up in multi-sig transactions.

The value proposal Bitcoin has is scarcity, and altcoins make that value proposal void.
My original comment here is to show that Ethereum has also inferior technology and politics (at least for some parts), but I would stay with Bitcoin even if Ethereum was superior.
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:38:12
Bitcoin lost lots of "dominance" last year due to altcoins emerging and some old ones appreciating value, now altcoins are crashing harder than Bitcoin. That's literally all it means. Don't read too much into the metric; it can be gamed and it's not that interesting anyway.
What I would hope is that people would learn from the failures of Ethereum!
1. There must be no leader, but all changes must have consensus.
1. Never change the rules for newly minted coins.
1. Layer 1 does not scale.
1. Smart contracts on the blockchain are a bad idea.
1. Overly complicated system will create unpredictable and unnecessary problems.
1. Account-based ledger causes problems and has no upside. UTXO-based (as Bitcoin has) is superior.
edit: added point about account- vs UTXO-based ledgers.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:59:20
In account-based book-keeping you need two extra commands: one to create an account and a second to destroy an account. Now, because account creation can fail (say, due to network congestion), all application developers need to take this error scenario into account.
Even more importantly, because there is no incentive to destroy an old account, blockchain pruning doesn't work or needs extra complexity. With UTXO-based book-keeping you can prune outputs with no balance.

Very much this.
I think my father is a very brilliant man. When I briefly once told him something about Bitcoin, he immediately said he doesn't like it. I was a bit shocked, but more than that I was extremely confused. My very smart dad did take a strong opinion on a subject without knowing almost anything about this? How can this happen?
I asked him why did he immediately take such a defensive position. It was one of the few times that I've asked him a question and he clearly wasn't immediately sure himself. After a minute or so, he replied that change is frightening.
After this incident we've talked about Bitcoin one or two times and he hasn't had a defensive stance anymore. But for dumb people or especially the proud ones the initial feeling might guide the opinion for a long time.
If the monetary system were to change, it would be a big-ass change. The dynamic effects of the change would impact very many areas of our lives. Think about how many have been completely against self-driving cars. Many of those people are slowly changing their opinions. A shift in the monetary system would, however, have magnitudes bigger and more changes to our daily lives.

Yes, exactly. I'm super happy that the blocksize debate has become a big technical discussion about Bitcoin fundamentals. Unfortunately, it seems that the discussion is slowly polarizing and people are fortifying their positions instead of trying to understand the other party. In healthy technical disputes people change sides when they realize/learn new things.
@_date: 2015-06-05 06:18:22
At least in computer science patents just don't work. Look at where the real technological break-troughs come from: Free and Open-Source Software. Based purely on technical merits, the proprietary software is just complete shit compared to the free software.
If you're not in the industry or you happen to just be clueless (like a lot of people I've met...), just look at things like the mobile phone market or server market. 90-99% of the work is already done by others (like the Linux kernel, database applications, HTTP servers, list really goes on forever) and companies capitalize on some end-product that really is just 1% of the work or maybe 10% if you're Google or Facebook.
Patents in computer science are just plain stupid and only clueless people can think they're OK.

Ever since I saw the Bitcoin report made by Bank of England I've been thinking about how much we actually trust the banks to do their accounting right. How many have actually ever looked if their balance is correct? I think those persons are close to zero. I wonder why people don't bring this point up more often?
Furthermore, I'm getting super tired when most users here on seem to take for granted that everyone likes credit/debit cards. I have always disliked pulling and therefore I still today do almost all of my purchases/payments either with cash or using my internet bank account. Both are inconvenient.

I think that this problem would be partially solved already only by informing people. There are lots of people who have servers and seeking for services to run on them. I used to have one in 2008-2013 (then it broke) and if I would've know about how to help the Bitcoin network I would've run a full node (in the beginning for mining :P but later for relaying transactions).

How do you know what transactions they have seen by the time they mined the block?
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:59:44
The real problem with short block target times is network propagation. Once a block is found, it's not relayed to the whole network instantly. If you see a cryptocurrency with short block target times, but still not a considerable amount of orphaned blocks, you know that the network of that coin is not properly decentralized, but rather centralized.

Coca-cola and McDonalds are "good-feeling" or whatever products (I don't know how to explain this in english, sorry), Bitcoin is more about education.

Gratz, you're smarter than I am. But if it would've gone up all the way I would have been the smarter of us. Investing in general is risky and you cannot know in advance what the best strategy will be.
p.s. Even though I'm at loss, what I care about is what the long-term price will be. Right now I'm less confident than what I was in 2013. Mainly because of fear of centralization and fear of regulation. Also, I feel that the community has too many extreme political agendas which hurt the adaptation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-12 20:05:01
I would say that Bitcoin requires less trust than what we need right now with our banking system. How do I know some IT persons working at my bank aren't altering the amount of money on their own accounts? It wouldn't show up for anyone.
Also, if someone says that don't read the Bitcoin code anyway (even though it's open source), I would like to ask how many are anyway reading that the changes in everyone bank account add up to the bottom line? I would guess those people are very few.

I don't want to be rude, but I don't think you get it when I say "technically" and "theorethically" and you are using "theorethically" when you mean "practically".
*Theorethically*: Assuming the network hashrate is both known with infinite accuracy and the hashrate doesn't change over time, you need just slightly over 50% of the hashrate and you can, after an infite amount of time, revert any transaction.
In practice, you are very correct that 3 blocks is as good as confirmed for most transactions.

I agree with OP that many of the businesses we are seeing enter the Bitcoin space are not making much use of the possibility to create a decentralized market. Why? Exactly because vendor lock-in is such a dominating way of thinking for venture capitalists.
I have myself an idea for a decentralized movie rental system. I've been developing it in my spare time. But the problem is that there's very little incentive to develop the system because even though it would be a billion dollar business, developers of the software won't get rich.
My opinion is that we should go the Linux/GNU/FOSS/whatever way. Just do things for fun and then some of the systems will actually be good and usable.
The nicest thing with getting a killer service that is completely decentralized is that then everyone who wants to use the service is forced to use Bitcoin just like we are forced to use fiat while grocery shopping :-) even if the end-user would never know the system internally uses Bitcoin.

My bandwidth at home is very sufficient for a Bitcoin transaction relay node. The main reason I'm not running one is that I don't have suitable server hardware (my desktop computers are too loud and allocated for different use). On top of that I have an expensive electricity contract, so the server should have low energy consumption. I don't think I'm the only one for whom bandwidth is not an issue, but still not running a bitcoin full node.

I don't buy this argument at all. More possibilities of spending bitcoin actually has the direct effect of increasing the price. Why? Because people who want to exchange bitcoin for a product own more coins than they spend. For example, we have someone with 0 XBT and then that person wants to buy something that costs 0.149 XBT. That person might very well buy 0.15 XBT (or more), but not the exact amount especially now that everything is listed as dollars or similar.
However, I would argue that this direct effect is very minimal and all the other factors contributing to price movement are way more significant. Indirect effects of merchant adoption such as increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin builds up slower. That effect will be / is significant.
If you look for an explanation for the price movement right now I would argue it comes from the mining operations. People have been arguing that once mining becomes non-profitable people unplug their machines since it then becomes more profitable to just purchase bitcoin directly. I think this is slowly changing. Now some actors have invested big amounts on housing and hardware and have loans to pay back. For these actors it might be best to keep the machines plugged, but still sells the coins immediately to pay the loans.

Chances are hackers already know about your server (source: experience with my own server and discussions with my friends who also have their own servers). In that case you don't expose anything more than the bitcoind software. It's always possible that there's a vulnerability, but my gut-feeling is that you probably are already running some other software that's more likely vulnerable.
So, if you've never seen anyone trying to access your server, maybe don't run it (if you've never seen it, you probably run your server within a closed network or do not know where to look). Otherwise, I'd say go for it!

Politicians need to stop listening to lobbyers from such players like copyright holders whose business models are completely out-dated. Instead, look for what new ideas and business models are emerging and might be part of the future. Not an easy task, but politics aren't supposed to be.

Once it has propagated in the network, it's hard to double-spend. In general, the merchant should only care about watching the propagation of the transaction.
Even if you would get "lucky" and the transaction isn't included in the following few blocks, most miners are still not picking up your double-spend transaction. But obviously you could include the double-spend transaction by mining the block yourself. This is not feasible for small sums.

Actually yes, this makes sense, but not for the reason you said. There's more need for relaying nodes (i.e. what people in the Bitcoin context like to call "full nodes") when there are many transactions. On the other hand, with many transactions the transaction fees go up.

Very good analysis!


Since Moore's Law is only a function of time, bitcoin price will correlate heavily with the hash rate. If we see that price and difficulty diverges over a long period of time, we know at least one of them must be wrong. My analysis what this means in practice is that the volatility of the bitcoin price will continue to decrease. It will be increasingly difficult to have a fast rally or flash crash.

The Bitcoin network defines that you should always follow the longest chain. If you have over half of the processing power of the network, you will eventually have the longer chain even if you would not accept blocks from others. If you don't accept blocks from others, you get to choose which transactions are included to the chain.
I'm not a miner myself, so I don't know how this works in practice, but if you've setup your mining gear to execute orders of the pool, you could theorethically be part of a "51% attack" without yourself even knowing. The best solution I'm aware of is having some kind of software which follows the blockchain and verifies the honesty of the pool. I think the P2Pool solutions work like this.
Note that the Bitcoin network was never designed to work using mining pools. The benefit of being in a pool is the stable income. If the difficulty would stay the same you would do equally fine without being part of any pool, you would just get paid less frequent, but a bigger amount. Over an infinite amount of time you would get the same amount of BTC.

It's not whether Bitcoin becomes the "worldwide standard currency" but about the price. After 5 years the price will either be close to zero or a lot more.

I'm currently not buying because the price is dropping. It's simply is a bad investment. (note however that I have a fair share of bitcoin in cold storage, so I will do fine even if I would miss out on a rally)
There are lots of doubtful people now. People who have invested too much in either mining or bitcoin itself. My prediction is that once these people have gotten burned enough, we can see a rally.
I predict that the rally will begin at latest when the effect of the next block reward halving starts kicking in. If I'm wrong, it will happen at latest a few halvings later. Or then we go to zero.

Please provide some evidence or your comment is actually the worst crap I have seen on reddit in a long time.
There are several other reasons too why "the dogecoin community is so much nicer than the bitcoin", but for me the main point is that I'm not coming to too "see nice people and have a good time". I come here to see good discussions, and where there are good technical / analytical / whatever discussions, feelings often get heated. It's important to keep comments directed to the discussed topic and never to flame the actual user. Similarly, if one's comments get responded with different views, one should not take to oneself.

I disagree with some of your points. Having followed Bitcoin closely since the November rally, I must say I think Bitcoin has a huge imago problem. I think the number one reason why the price is not higher is that people feel Bitcoin is for nerds. People trying to find out about Bitcoin who end up here on will most likely feel very alienated when so many are talking about both technical possibilities people aren't interested in (such as untracable transactions) and illegal stuff (such as buying drugs/weapons).
The second biggest problem I think Bitcoin is facing is altcoins. Not because altcoins are a real threat, but because normal people who don't understand how Bitcoin works and try to check it up on the internet stumble on lots of altcoin propaganda. They don't understand that it's bullshit. They don't know that most of the technical differences implemented in the altcoins can be changed into Bitcoin too, if they would seriously be superior to how it's now. Pretty much only the distribution of ownership is what changes from coin to coin.
Then there are smaller problems such as usability &amp; end-user security issues, the exchanges could be better, too few merchants are accepting Bitcoins and overall immature market. These are smaller problems because they are being fixed already.
In conclusion: I'm currently bearish because of the imago issue. Fix that and I see the price increasing very considerably, probably ATH even. How to fix it? Make Bitcoin cool. Make it cool to take a selfie when you make a Bitcoin payment at the bar. Have some contests where people make short and cool videos of themselves paying in Bitcoin and upload it to youtube. Don't make Bitcoin look like the tool you use to fund illegal activity such as torrent uploading. Don't emphasize on the things Bitcoin solves when talking to people who don't have that problem (when was the last time you needed to send an untraceable transaction to another country? Btw you can pay the guy next door pretty much untraceably using cash).

For me the big thing is that Bitcoin is essentially is a proof of ownership. You have a private key which you use to spend your coins. You can't spend what you don't own.
A bank on the other hand can change their balance without any outisders noticing. Central banks print new money out of thin air. Criminals try to do that too.

I think you are oversimplifying. First of all, Bitcoin should **not** be a crusade. If you're going to another subreddit thinking that you're going to do some tipping there, you are, in my humble opinion, already going wrong.
If you tip a small amount, people not used to tipping will feel it's offensive and wont see the effort to even collect the tip. Your post will be just regarded as spam. On the other hand, if you tip, say, $100 they will easily get suspicious and think that it can't be real money or it's a ponzi scheme or whatever, because who would give out free money?
Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't tip when you see content that is worth the amount of money you are willing to tip. I'm just saying that it's better for the content to come to you. Just browse reddit like you casually do. Tip when you feel like it. Don't make it your mission.
And when it comes to tipping in our own subreddit I think it's not a waste since "readers here already believe in Bitcoin" or whatever. Personally, my own faith in Bitcoin goes up and down all the time. Tipping, and all the positive spirit followed by it, has most certainly strengthened my trust in Bitcoin.

OK since you're making such a bold statement then please correct me what I've understood wrong thusfar. My understanding is that someone is broadcasting transactions with changed data (TX id or something, not anything critical, but makes some wallet implementations confused if they use the original copy of the transaction). If you have just one server doing this, I don't see how you can manage to get enough penetration. For this to work on a large scale you need to have broadcasting servers (i.e. full nodes) around the network. One would not be enough.

I would describe in laymans terms the big difference of a decentralized system and a centralized one in the following way:
- If a decentralized system has grown big (as in the amount of usage and exposure) and it still works, you can trust it the same way you can trust 2 + 2 to be equal to 4.
- No matter how big a centralized system is, you can never fully trust it. You don't know if someone is spying it, it will very much likely be hacked into at some point and the operator can always at any point in time pull the plug.
If you don't care about leaking your social media posts, it's completely okay to use Facebook and such. With money you should care. If your credit card number is stored on a server, it will leak. Note also: even if the service provider claims to not store your credit card number, you cannot be sure.

Yeah an mp3 is copyable, so that's not the strength of colored coins. But a music stream is not (as trivially), so there it would be better applicable.
I don't really like this music analogy, so instead I will describe how it could work with a virtual ticket to a live video stream for a sports event;
* You do the normal handshake with the server.
* You authorize yourself using the colored coin.
* You get access to the stream.
Since the communication with the server is encrypted, it's not very trivial to share the stream. You would need to capture the stream on the end users equipment, then broadcast it forward (edit: another solution would be to share your private key). Doable, but a) not exactly what the average Joe does b) in court you can't say you didn't know what you were doing was illegal.
For the consumer I think the best thing is that you don't have to rely on unreliable services to authenticate you. For example, I'm using Facebook to authenticate to some places and I uncomfortable with that. But I feel even more uncomfortable with some other solutions.

Here's my suggestion: **Competition for bars to adopt Bitcoin as payment**
The competition would work out as follows: The contest with the rules are announced. The bars send their application and then a suitable amount of bars spread across the world are accepted, for example 20 bars, of which 5 in Europe etc. Then each accepted bar would create their own thread here on with information about the bar and their payment processing method.
The interesting part would be where customers are encouraged to go to the bar, buy a drink and make a video of all off this. Cool, not nerdy videos. People here on would then vote on the videos (that's essentially how reddit works). So, in other words, it would be important for the bar that the user videos are succesful too, because the final voting will most likely be highly influenced by these videos.
The final voting would be made by some predefined people, for example mods from and maybe some community figures. 3-5 judges are a suitable amount. Since they probably wont travel around the world to all the competing bars, it would be most fair if they wouldn't personally visit any of them.
The competition could be split into subcategories, such as 1) Bitcoin payment processing 2) How cozy the place feels (heavily influenced by user videos) 3) Bar own application and advertisement video.
* Many new bars would adopt Bitcoin
* Many new users would get the user experience of paying with Bitcoin
* Local magazines often love to write stories about things like this, would probably be much good publicity for Bitcoin
* Bars would have difficulties in adopting Bitcoin as a payment and the whole competition would fall flat. But if this would be the case, we would have a bigger problem than the competition failing.
If the prize pool would be $10k or more, I'm sure many bars would grab the opportunity and do this well. Even if they wouldn't win, only attending the competition would give them a non-trivial amount of publicity and customers.
Please, give me feedback if you think there's something I've missed why this wouldn't work.

Technically incorrect. Theorethically you can orphan arbitrarily old blocks (except for the genesis block?).
Each day there are around 144 blocks (6 block per hour, 24 hours per day) created. That means that to orphan a transaction that was included in the blockchain one day ago you have to mine around 144 blocks to orphan that block.

Even though I disagree with you, I welcome this discussion very warmly to this subreddit.
I'm by no means an expert in transactions of this scale. But when talking about transactions the average Joe does daily, the current trust-based solution is very expensive.
I can't remember the exact numbers, but in Finland it has been estimated that both credit card payments and cash payments have similar cost. Credit card payments have a cost because the payment processor takes their share. Cash payments have a cost because of security measures have a cost.
Right now almost all Bitcoin payments have a fiat interface and hence the payment isn't that cheap when all factors are taken into account. But once volatility and fiat exchange is gone, I could see the Bitcoin payments being a way to lower transaction costs.
You could argue all day that customers aren't paying the transaction costs, but we all are smarter than that. I'd say a expense for the merchant always turns into a cost for the customer.

Omg no. You misunderstood me totally.
I have capital and I don't spend it immediately. Some of my capital is in fiat and some in bitcoins. When I buy something, if I can buy it with bitcoins, I use them. The more I can buy with bitcoins, the more I change capital from fiat to bitcoins.

How can Bitcoin treat Dogecoin (or any other coin for that matter) in any way?
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:25:58
I upvoted you, but I want to counter your one point and add two of my own.
* The start-ups are not Bitcoin specific, but more about cryptocurrencies in general. If you buy Bitcoin, you need Bitcoin to get big. Most of the start-ups can, however, switch to any cryptocurrency they want if shit hits the fan for Bitcoin.
* I've not invested more than I can afford to lose. But it annoys me to be at a loss right now since my girlfriend dislikes every penny I've spent on Bitcoin as long as it's not profitable. I.e. if Bitcoin would go to zero, my biggest loss is my girlfriend making jokes "mwahaha do you remember when you invested in Bitcoin?". I would guess many have the same thing with friends and family.
* I invested into Bitcoin thinking it's a long-term investment (will not touch for ~5 years at least) and for ideological reasons. But since I've seen how fast the price can go up, it's annoying to realise that *my long-term investment will indeed be a long-term one*.
Essentially, I would guess many people feel uncomfortable about their investments because of psychology.
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:35:40
I don't have much problem of this really. It's just annoying. When I bought I asked her and she answered something like "you do what you want with your money". Now, if I bring up the price, she replies "so you're at loss now!". Needless to say, we don't talk much about the price.
Only one time did she bring it up herself. It was when I got a large bill from the social security bureau (they claimed they had payed me too much in 2012). I was all like "fuck this shit I just lost this much money!" and she replied "hey, it's in the same order of magnitude as your investment in Bitcoin!". She instantly backed up from that statement, though. But, if the price of Bitcoin would be double that what it was when I bought, she would maybe have said "you could pay it with your revenue from Bitcoin" (which I obviously would not do ;D).

Assuming the instances share the same bandwidth, why would there be any benefit?
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:13:07
Why do you need shorter block target times?
Note: 10 min target time doesn't mean there's a block created every 10 min. Sometimes it takes 2 min, sometimes 40 min etc. It's a random process.
The smaller the target time, the higher the chance is that two miners mine a block about the same time. Note that there's always a propagation time for the block to be broadcasted.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:37:24
This makes zero sense.
* Like pointed out, they have the keys to your BTC anyway.
* Like pointed out, the exchange would have to run on-chain, which is neither feasible nor secure.
* Furthermore, for security reasons, this exchange would have to move your BTC to new addresses each time you spend any BTC. Wouldn't be hard to track what the new address is, but I just wanted to point that out.

I don't get it. Surely you can't add the same transaction twice into a block. So do miners keep both transactions (until one gets verified) or just the one they saw first? My guess is they keep only the first.
To have good penetration you need to be all around the network. Otherwise the original will be too widely distributed before your altered copy gets too far.

Well, if the bottleneck would be CPU time, running several instances would make the situation only worse, because then you would have to verify the same transactions multiple times! :)

I've been watching SC2 a lot since 2010, even arranged a few tournaments myself and started the StarCraft club at our university (OtaCraft, hence I'm OC-Petrus...).
As much as I like seeing new money enter the scene, I don't think the ROI is the best ever. The problem is that people watching eSports is in general tech-savvy and just mentioning Bitcoin somewhere would probably not convert anyone (some people embrace the technology already and others have already taken a stance against it). The sponsoring deal should aim to achieve education of the viewers, not merely exposure.
But if you get a nice deal where we can have an educational video or someone talking about Bitcoin (HomeStoryCup has been doing this kind of things), then I would say yes, absolutely do this!

You use incorrect terminology. You mean that how long the coins have been laying in the wallet they are sent from.
Older coins are accepted with lower fees (possibly even zero fee) because there's less threat that they're being used to flood the network. You see, if there wouldn't be any fees, you could just send coins around to different wallets you own and thus cause a DoS attack on the network. That's not an issue when big amounts of coins are being sent from wallets that have been untouched for a long time.

There are several banks and several payment processors. But now this problem with SEPA affected each and every one of them! It had nothing to do with a single bank, a single payment processor or a single employer. It was the backbone system which failed.

Bitcoin works great for paying for decentralized services. I'm certain that at least if Bitcoin really takes off, we will see a lot of new decentralized services. They are a lot better than centralized since the lack of vendor lock-in will push prices down.

Yes, corruption in Finland is very little compared to many other countries. But there's another problem in Finland which is very similar to corruption.
For example, many government top job positions are not filled according to who's the best for the job. Instead, the biggest political parties have agreed to share those positions. Certain positions always go to representatives of certain parties. For many positions they also rotate the responsibility, so if one party had the position previously, next is the other party which gets to choose their candidate.
Also, we have this "hyvä veli verkosto" (good brother network) phenomena. In a small country the judge handling a case of a businessman might be a friend of that businessman. It's illegal, but it happens. Same goes for political decision-making and so forth.

I do believe that with time it will be.
The way conventional currencies work with central authorities controlling them is that you make all the rules and adjustments according to the idea that "money comes to money". The motivation is that without it there wouldn't be investments made, but rather people would hold on to their wealth. But is this true at all?
I do believe that the inflation was originally created to over-come other problems such as counterfeiting money. With Bitcoin it's not possible to counterfeit money.
After the bankers found out that inflating the value of a monetary unit actually accelerates their accumulation of wealth, they obviously wanted to hold onto it.
Please, if you think otherwise, educate me why I would be wrong in my analysis.

Merchants are also using payment processors and conversion to fiat. Especially once the conversion to fiat is gone, using Bitcoin can be a considerable saving for the merchant which then again, like you said, will turn into a saving for the customer.

I think the movie distribution industry is going to a terrible direction. Latest news is Netflix producing their own [movies](
With Bitcoin it could be possible to create a decentralized way of doing movie rental. It would open up the market a lot and hopefully promote indie production of movies (just like what happened to electronic games).
The thing could work so that you have trackers and streamers. Trackers list movies that streamers provide. If you agree to rent the movie, you put money into escrow on the tracker. After the streaming is done, you release the money from escrow. Movie producers could digitally sign the stream so that the receiver can verify the authenticity of the streamer.
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:17:52
That is correct. They might also simply add the transaction they see first. I.e. still not picking up your double-spend transaction.
The point I'm trying to make is that even if your previous transaction wasn't immediately included in a block, it doesn't necessarily mean your double-spend transaction will be. Only if you mine it yourself, you can be 100% sure.

BTW I mostly use cash and they check my bills very often, especially at the food shop. Barber shops and caffeterias not so much. Last Friday they checked my bill at the restaurant.

I'd say that is very disputable.
I think it's way better to go with what's accurate. I back up my view with facts such as the recent survey which said 11% of the Finns show interest in Bitcoin. IMO, that is already way more than what's needed to get the ecosystem rolling. I.e. I don't think we need to convince people who feel Bitcoin is "weird and dangerous". What we need right now is to tell facts to people who are interested and to get technical and political solutions to ease commerce.

If I wouldn't have had the conversation with my work colleagues that I had a few weeks ago, I would agree with you.

I disagree with your point about the wasteful verification algorithm. Also, I disagree with how you present the pressure toward centralization. The problem is mining pools, not the people owning miners themselves. I think there are still a solid amount of independent mining actors.
I also disagree with your third point. In which system would the verification be instant? Furthermore, your fifth point is just about how gold is better than Bitcoin, but gold is inferior to Bitcoin in many many ways.
The only point you present I think is note-worthy is your fourth point.
My list of technical threats would be:
1) Problemacy of the reward system which leads to miners join mining pools. However, if miners can verify (in technical means) that the mining pool operators are honest, this is not a huge issue.
2) The current network design would lead to an ultimately very expensive network if everyone would use 100% on-chain transactions. However, a lot of work is put into solving this. I haven't followed too closely any project, but there are ideas about side-chains, tree-chains and even completely wild ideas about rearranging the network is a vastly different way.
Personally I think the biggest threats for the success of Bitcoin are political and other non-technical things. For example, are people that have power and money going to resist the change? Is the current distribution of Bitcoin ownings too centralized? Will the economy model of Bitcoin work?
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:35:05
I'm not sure I'm following you...
Are you saying that you have a charge-back system anyway in place so double-spending is not an issue? If that's the case, you don't need colored coins in the first place.
How I've understood what NASDAQ is doing (and pretty much everyone else who wants to use colored coins) is to avoid having a trusted party who will solve "charge-back" disputes. Instead, the trust is put on the secure blockchain.

Digital stuff distributed in a decentralized way. It's not possible to do it when you have a bank in between, but with Bitcoin you can do peer to peer payments so it's possible.
* Data storage (for example storj)
* Decentralized replacement for Steam
* Decentralized movie rental/distribution (working in my spare time on this)
* Decentralized music playback like spotify
It takes a bit of engineering effort, but pretty much all digital content or services can be replaced with decentralized technology. It hasn't yet been done because it wasn't possible before Bitcoin.

I just finished watching [Andreas Antonopoulos talks Bitcoin @ Melbourne Bitcoin Technology Center (Full) ](
Well worth the watch for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
I'm especially happy that Andreas talks about the killer value proposition Bitcoin originally had for me personally. I have never trusted credit card payment systems because I've always thought they are broken by design. Pull is wrong. Especially since I as a customer can't know if the merchant stores my credit card information somewhere.
Things are actually getting worse as we speak. While I pay my rent, electricity and internet bills with internet banking, I use cash for my daily purchases. The trend is to lower the amount of cash payments. It's all the time in the news. But Bitcoin is the only alternative to cash that I currently trust.
On another note, Andreas talk also got me to understand why privacy in Bitcoin is important. From a personal privacy point-of-view I couldn't care less if my purchases would be visible to everyone. But from a security point-of-view privacy is very important. It's hard to point a gun on a guys head if you don't know who the guy is.

You are correct. The change will not be initiated by those who are today on the winning side of things. But why are you so sure the same thing what happen to the game industry wont happen in the movie industry?
The indie movie scene is actually huge if we don't look at the market capitalization, but rather at how many competent and passionate artists there are and how many movies are produced every year. They're just lacking a good distribution network.
What makes you think that there aren't "minecrafts" in the indie movie industry?

I agree, but it's also worth noting that routing in IPv4 is a pain. I mean, if every consumer would now get 1000x faster internet connections, core network routers would die.

@_date: 2015-05-09 09:52:06
I think there are at least two major flaws in your ideas.
1) Fee's should not be targeted to a percentile. That would mean you could split one transaction into 1000 transactions and still pay the same fee. That would be extremely bad.
2) If the target fee was X, everyone would likely just always put an X fee to their transaction. Therefore no adjustment to the block size.

It's not strictly "out of question", but it's dangerous. Last time I checked what peers I was connected to there were peers running over 2 years (!!) old clients.
Here on many make it always sound like you can deploy a new client in just a few weeks. Well, not to everyone. Of course, some people are on Ubuntu LTS (without Bitcoin PPA) or something, and those are a lost cause anyway, but even through normal distribution channels many don't get updates right away. Do we want to lose those peers? And it's not even only about losing the peers - if these peers run some business or something, they start following the old chain and could get burned.

What about UTXO set size growth?
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:07:16
Thanks. Did I understand it right: you, as the holder of coins, need to hold that extra data to prove your UTXO is that one particular leaf in the accumulator? Then, as leaves around your leaf change, you need to update that data? However, the fully validating nodes can build up the partial UTXO set needed for verification out of the accumulator (when provided with the extra data)?
I very much like the incentives here!
Yes, thanks, I'm familiar with UTXO commitments. I think it should be forked ASAP. As a bootstrapper you anyway decide freely how many old blocks you want. The security in Bitcoin is provided by the cumulative hashrate used. By just verifying like one year of blocks you get almost the same security as from verifying the whole history.
Fun fact: full verification in Ethereum is impossible because they had an exploitable feature that rendered one or several blocks impossible to verify. In Ethereum, you have to bootstrap using a flag to not verify. ��‍♂️ True 
@_date: 2019-03-14 09:24:10
Your math is correct, but your premise is wrong. Safe investments exist because we are in an inflationary economy. In a deflationary economy there are no safe investments. You need to be really smart about your investments in order to actually do some profit.
The challenge of doing profitable investments is why a deflationary economy seems scary. If no-one is ready to invest, the economy will grind to a halt.
However, the safe investments in an inflationary economy are not a blessing either. Today everyone and their dogs want to invest in index funds in order to combat inflation. This is dumb money that just inflates the stock markets. Can this process go on forever? Many have been saying for decades that the bubble has to pop eventually. I believe so, too.
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:45:00
I fully agree!
However, I want to add a few things. First, make sure that you actually run the updates and reboot your machine. By default, distributions such as Ubuntu are set to run updates for critical vulnerabilities automatically once a day. However, if you don't restart whatever application has the vulnerability, you are still vulnerable. If the vulnerability is in the kernel, you need to reboot the machine *. Personally I reboot once a day.
Furthermore, while official distribution channels provide a far better security channel than just downloading random binaries from the internet such as is the case with OS X and Windows, it is no golden bullet either. Especially if you are running a lesser known distribution or a rolling distro like Arch, you risk getting malicious software. Even with Debian (and therefore Ubuntu) there is a small risk you get infected software because there are just so many packages and it is at least theoretically possible some malicious code slips through even though maintainers would be benevolent - a competent hacker can disguise the code. This has never happened, but I would absolutely not risk more money than trivial amounts. If the amount of money to be made is enough, someone will absolutely try and eventually succeed in such an attack.
* There's live patching of the kernel since 4.0. However, there are some limitations to it.

Absolutely. Milk is the worst. Cow milk is something like 2-4x cheaper in comparison to milk made out of soy or oat. That is crazy considering that cow milk lasts for like 5 days and soy milk a year. Still, the supermarket next to me is constantly out of soy milk...
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:54:12
Also, out of own need, I've been thinking about a scheme where one stores coins with the help of "banks". While I haven't figured out all technical details yet, the need would be for something like:
* You make an agreement with N "banks".
* You can move your coins by getting a signature from yourself + one of the N "banks".
* You can move your coins by getting a signature from N-M "banks". (M is greater than or equal to 0)
With this scheme you aren't yet screwed if someone gets access to your keys. Also, with this scheme you aren't screwed if one "bank" f*cks up. Also, if you lose your keys, you can still recover your coins.
The only way the government can seize your coins is by raiding N-M "banks".
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:48:45
What fees are you referring to? All my payments have been just the € amount with an exchange rate that accounts for some transaction fees for the merchant. I haven't always checked afterwards, maybe I've been scammed some cents here or there. Would be most honest if merchants would clearly state "we add 10% or 10€ if you pay with bitcoin". Then the shop across the street sees the other merchant having success and they say "we add 2% or 2€". Eventually the merchants get good equipment and education (by experience) and don't need to charge more. In the end, they can charge less since they don't have to pay credit card fees, but that's a long way out...
@_date: 2019-03-22 16:02:59
I agree with the sentiment. However, even though I am a Bitcoin maximalist and have not invested in other coins, I have been made aware that many coins are exchanged for with Bitcoin. I.e. say you have coin A and want to switch B. You sell A for Bitcoin and buy B with the newly acquired Bitcoin.
Assuming this is true, the Bitcoin volume is inflated a ton.
Furthermore, the volumes reported by many exchanges are not reliable.

Yes. What I meant was that using the accumulator + proofs you can create a subset of the UTXO set. If you get all proofs, you can recreate the whole UTXO set.
Anyway, utreexo sounds very interesting! I can't wait to read up more about it. Also, it will be interesting to hear if it opens up some new attack vectors. As I understand it, it seems very good!


Let's pretend that between genesis and 1 year there was a cumulative amount of work X. If during the last 1 year there was the same cumulative amount of work X it means that by just verifying the last 1 year worth of blocks you have 50% security compared to verifying the whole history. Since the hashrate has typically been increasing at an exponential rate, the vast majority of work has been done for the newest blocks.


I tried to look up a source for you, but couldn't find it. It might be it was just a temporary bug in geth. Or it might be it was so slow that the Ethereum camp suggested doing bootstrapping without verification (they still do).
@_date: 2019-03-13 08:43:50

@_date: 2019-03-25 13:23:35
UTXO set growth is an attack vector. When fees are low, you can spam the network. Fully validating nodes must store all UTXO in memory. If the set becomes too big, validation grinds to a halt.

Now the market is starting to get saturated and there's real competition. Still, many restaurants don't want to serve stuff they don't know how to serve (which makes total sense). Some places making the switch initially set the prices for the vegan offerings very high.
In the supermarkets there's still not enough saturation of vegan options and many producers ask insane prices for sub-par products.

Thanks for the link, I watched the video, very interesting stuff! I didn't know about cryptographic accumulators. It's going to take some time for me to understand them completely.
If I get it right, with utreexo not even fully validating nodes need to store the UTXO set, just the accumulator(s). However, I think I've still gotten something wrong because the guy in the video explains that no hard fork is required...

There are lots of parallels between wanting to spend bitcoin and wanting to eat vegan food. Vegans are often willing to pay extra to not have any animal based products served. That is steadily creating an ever increasing market. Eventually vegan food is not going to be more expensive but cheaper.
I understand many consumers dislike the idea that you'd have to pay extra if you pay with bitcoin. However, I think that is the correct way to create adaption. Merchants need more equipment and experience. When there's one customer a year it just doesn't make sense.

You send to the wrong address, you are running malicious software etc.

This is a big question, so the full answer is never going to be simple.
In short: Bitcoin does not get updates without consensus.
You are possibly not asking about updates to Bitcoin, but rather about updates to the reference client, i.e. Bitcoin core. That one is being maintained by several people. However, everyone is free to implement their own client. If your own client follows the Bitcoin consensus rules, it will be part of the Bitcoin network. If not, it will split into an alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:40:52
Personally, I don't think two coins with the same hashing algorithm can survive. It's very likely that one of the chains has a lot more hashing power than the other. That makes the chain with the lesser hashrate susceptible to a block reorganization attack.
Obviously, as seen from the various scrypt altcoins and ETH/ETC, these coins can co-exist and get  speculatory value. But to become a real, stable currency I don't think is possible. There can be just one with a specific PoW algorithm.

You need to account for transaction fees too.
@_date: 2019-02-03 18:33:39
Sorry the late reply.
I agree with everything you just said! I think the attack you just described is a real one and it sets a constraint on how big transactions you can receive. I don't think one should consider a payment confirmed until at least several magnitudes more energy (in terms of cost) has been spent verifying it.
The way I see Proof of Work is that it is a generalization of Proof of Spent Resources. In Bitcoin that resource is energy. During early ASIC days that resource was unfortunately mining hardware, but I think that as mining hardware becomes more optimal it becomes harder to develop it further. Thereafter, the initial purchasing cost of hardware is not as essential, but it is more important where the cheapest energy is produced.
The security that the mining produces to the network depends on how much resources are spent, i.e. the cost of energy. If energy is 10x more expensive, mining can be cut into a 10th of what it was and we have the same amount of security. Due to the genius design in Bitcoin, this is actually what happens: the difficulty adjusts depending on how much reward there is and how much the cost of energy is.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:04:37
The whole point of your graph is to show that once the mining reward goes down, the energy consumption will too. I agree with this.
However, the mining reward will ultimately be made up mostly from transaction fees. That's at least the original plan.

@_date: 2015-08-17 19:01:45
You make good points, but I think that only the blockchain with the biggest hashpower can survive. If miners follow what the majority of the demography wants, the chain with alternative rules is toast.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:52:01


Yes. This is why so many have been saying for years that in, say, 10-20 years from now Bitcoin will either be worth 0 or millions. As the block reward is reduced, the price must go up and/or the transaction fees must go up.
Btw, I recently heard a podcast interview with Peter Todd where he suggested that in the future we would have a fixed inflation rate for Bitcoin (say, 1% yearly) in order to secure mining. Personally, I'm not sure I like the idea. In any case, I guess we are going to have a huge debate and more forks as the block reward gets lower, since some are going to want a fixed inflation rate and others want to keep the consensus rules intact.


This actually a really good point, I never thought of this!

The point is that the double-spend attempt is seen right away. Double-spending without revealing it before the block is mined is really hard and risky. Double-spending by orphaning the block with the valid transaction is even harder and riskier.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:34:12
Maybe you're right. I haven't been following scrypt coins very closely, just seen a few posts about how they can be - and have been - rendered useless by large pools joining in mining them for a short period of time. But maybe it would be different here...
It's just that I have thought that fundamentally Bitcoin is built upon the trust that there is no majority of hashing power that is not used in Bitcoin mining. This means that you can trust the blocks that you see - even if they are provided to you by an authority you do not trust, such as your ISP - just based on the hashpower. But if there is other bigger hashpower that is not participating in mining the chain you're interested in you need to make sure all the time that you're being offered the valid blocks.
I have to think about this a bit more...
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:47:27
You don't need to store the whole blockchain. You just need to store some last blocks + the UTXO set.
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:23:36
This is an extremely important question which anyone who is interested in Bitcoin should be asking themselves.
Changing the supply limit, or even just the issuance rate, would have significant economic impact on Bitcoin. Therefore, it is very hard to reach consensus on such a change since while some would win, others would lose.
This is in contrast to central banks which use different tools to stimulate or cool down their respective markets. When central banks do quantitave easing or similar measures, some win some lose.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:32:03
Is this correct? I think that what you're talking about is the backlog of unconfirmed transactions.
Mempool is the set of UTXO's (unspent transaction outputs) that every full node needs to keep track of because these are the outputs a transaction could spend.
Side note: At least on any sane operating system you don't need to care if data is kept in the "memory" or on a disk - or even on a network storage. The operating system makes this all transparent for you.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:56:21


This is completely assuming there is a block size limit.
If there wouldn't be a block size limit, the cheapest way to destroy Bitcoin would by far be to create massive blocks.


What is your suggestion? No offence, but spam has been a problem for communication networks since god knows how many years. I don't think it's solvable on that level. Especially since in Bitcoin you need to store every transaction until the end of time (except for prunable transactions).

Increasing the block size limit would not help you get your transaction through during a spam attack. On the contrary, both things I mentioned would help you.
Replace by fee: Double spend your own transaction with a higher fee.
Child pays parent: You send a new transaction that uses a UTXO from your previous transaction. Here you specify a higher fee. Both transactions get an elevated priority (because the second transaction isn't valid without the first).

First I want to state that I'm pro increasing the block size limit. The proposal of starting from 8 MiB and doubling it every two years until 4 GiB sounds solid to me.
But there are a few realities everyone interested in the matter should understand
* More important than the exact block size limit is that clients would start using adaptive fees. On a protocol level there are currently two solutions proposed; replace by fee and child pays parent. It could also be solved by other means than directly using the Bitcoin network, such as using a payment processor.
* Changing the protocol version (hard fork) is not as easy as many think. Just fire up your bitcoind and look at what versions peers connected to you are. Are you seeing lots of old clients? Yes, you are. Part of the problem is probably how Linux distributions stage new software. I would guess poor Windows users who don't have the luxury of a package manager aren't very keen on manually updating their software either.
* What I think is most important is that fundamental rules for our currency cannot be hastily changed even if there is a small majority supporting the change. What if Bitcoin would become the world currency and then some centralized authority would propose changes like changing the mining revenue? It seems crazy the average person would agree on that, but I would be my ass of the majority of Europeans think the QE was a good move. After all, the decision was in theory made by democraticly elected politicians.  
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:51:58
Well, we don't want spam on the network. Do you run a full node? I definitely do not want waste on my hard drive.
What we need is clients who use adaptive transaction fees.
Raising the block size limit because of spam is ridiculously stupid.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:58:18
Because the miners gets the revenue from the block (block reward + transaction fees), but every full node needs to store all the blocks and they don't get any revenue for that.
Without a block size limit you could attack Bitcoin by creating very big blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-01 09:39:26
Woah, you found my old thread :-)


Yes, you are correct. I didn't think about this when I wrote about using IPv6 multicast. IPv6 multicast is trusting centralized authorities by design and we cannot have such authorities filter transactions. Therefore, all transactions have to go through and the downside to this is that we're allowing spam.


I quickly looked through your comment history and you seem to have dug way deeper into IPv6 than I have :-) I have taken the basic courses. As far as I know, IPv6 multicast is not in wide use anywhere. But because of the hierarchical design of the IPv6 address space it should be easy to make it work. On the other hand, as long as it's not thoroughly tested we don't know all the attack vectors.
Still, I think that bandwidth demand for video streaming will be magnitudes higher than what Bitcoin will ever require.
By the way, I made my post before this blocksize debate blew up. Personally, I still don't understand at all why some people are saying bandwidth is the issue in scaling. If Chinese miners are having big latencies we should have longer block target times.

Yeah, I'm not too keen on "decentralized games", whatever that may be. The interesting thing is the stress testing of the Lightning Network. What happens when there are lots of transactions? Will we get consolidation of routes?
The interesting application of the Lightning Network are the "coffee purchases", i.e. daily purchases in brink 'n' mortar shops.
It's also rather interesting that if LN becomes widely used, it will hopefully be very low cost for merchants to setup receiving of payments. Right now, it's in many places not feasible to accept credit/debit card payments. On the other hand, accepting cash is a security risk and also a hassle, because one needs to maintain change.

I'm absolutely not saying it's going to kill Bitcoin. I don't even think there is an attack vector here.
However, this is relevant when designing fee estimators. It's also relevant when designing businesses that operate with Bitcoin. And for everything else I haven't thought of just yet.
Especially if the Bitcoin consensus protocol is changed, this is something to consider.

You don't understand how to design secure technology at all. You are proposing to open up a new attack vector on Bitcoin and vaguely backing up with statements like "gmail knows how to handle e-mail spam". That comparison is so stupid on so many levels I won't even bother dissecting it.
Note: I think the block size limit could be considerably higher. But removing it all together based on your analysis would be beyond insane and I would instantly sell all my BTC if the core devs would think that's a good idea.
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:26:48
I don't think they want to hurt Bitcoin. Personally, I think they've invested too much and they would not feel comfortable seeing Bitcoin have a low valuation - I don't know, maybe low for them is $50, maybe it's $500. They need the price to go up rather sooner than later so that they can sell a bit and not be so heavily invested anymore.
I'm personally at a huge loss with my Bitcoin investments, but I followed the guiding that's been given everywhere; don't invest more than you're comfortable in losing. Therefore, I care way more that Bitcoin is successful eventually. Maybe it takes 20 years, maybe I'm an old grand-papa then, just as long as it eventually happens and it works.
@_date: 2019-04-07 10:06:10
Hello, I just want to quickly chime in a point out that in Ethereum the problem with validation of history is not due to amount of transactions, but due to their "world machine" i.e. scripting language. They have some blocks containing transactions that (at least with the geth client) take a ton of time to validate. The same would not apply with Bitcoin because the scripting language Bitcoin uses is far more conservative. Also, in Bitcoin we only care about the current state. Old state is interesting only when bootstrapping (builds security, but you have gained that security once you validated, so you can throw the old states away after validation) or when doing blockchain analysis.
However, I think that if the blocksize is increased, we hit problems with block propagation latency and also the current state can grow big. Both are attack vectors.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:32:20
Hmm, OK, I misunderstood you. You were being nit-picky while I thought you were defending the actions.

Yeah, I agree. For security, it would be best if the bulk of mining equipment would always be turned on. Or at least it would make analysis a lot easier. Analysis such as "is the transaction confirmed or reversable?" and "what kind of fees do I need to pay to get my transaction included in the blockchain".
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:44:11
I'd guess it's cheaper to not go into mining in the first place then. Just send the spam transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:50:52


That's a valid point. But usually the pro big block commenters talk about how a rapid increase of interest towards Bitcoin would be problematic because of how long transactions would take to confirm. So, even if we would have a moon rocket take-off right now, it wouldn't take us as far as 8 MiB hard limit on blocks would.
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:19:29

You get it 100%! I think the post is confusing because it's lacking motivation and discussion. That is a lesson learned for me: it's confusing if I just share some analysis without also stating what are the impacts / why it would be interesting. I just wanted to share something I realized today and thought maybe someone fills in on the impacts. I admit it's confusing.
I think it is obvious this fluctuation is going to happen. The difficulty is determined based on how long it took to mine 2016 blocks. If mining equipment is switched off 90% of the time, the difficulty is going to be 10% out of the total hashrate.
I don't think countermeasures are needed.
However, this is important when considering how many confirmations are needed. It is also significant when doing fee estimation (RBF is absolutely going to be required). Also when considering network upgrades this has to be taken into account.

@_date: 2019-04-12 05:25:11
The point is that fees are going to fluctuate very fast. Everyone is going to want to pay as little as possible and therefore price discovery is going to be constant and fast.
However, retargetting is not that fast. Because of security reasons, it is done only every 2016 blocks.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:16:07
So how do you fix it? Let me guess: introduce an attack vector?
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:52:13
I'm not hoping for economic collapse. I'm hoping that the average people would understand the injustice that our current economic system is.
I would rather have the Bitcoin system where miners get some, because, while suboptimal, at least it's completely transparent. Compare that to QE, which is decided by few and the benefit the elite more than others. Or compare it to banks not letting you have your money - oh wait, it's technically not yours.
@_date: 2019-04-11 08:59:39
Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear with my point. After just a few block halvings, the fees will be bigger than the block reward. Since fees are going to fluctuate, also hash rate is, and this will mean fluctuation in expected block time.
Also, if the network rules do get upgraded at some point, it is important to keep this in mind. With the current rules I don't think there is any attack vector.

I agree fully that fiat is a bad idea. It is virtual and has to be centrally planned, giving unfair power to those in charge.
We should go back to commodity money. Gold is hard to store, hard to divide and slow to transact over a distance. I'm a Bitcoin maximalist, but in my humble opinion Bitcoin is still hard to store. It is also unclear to me if Bitcoin can be kept as it is, i.e. without central planning, or will we see more attempts to alter it.

The protocol can't be changed without consensus. Parameters that affect economy will probably never reach consensus, such as the blocksize limit.
Also, I think you have it backwards comparing mining to the cost of electricity. The security from the Bitcoin blockchain comes exactly from the cost of electricity. The more expensive the electricity, the more security per hashrate. We should hope for expensive electricity, not cheap.
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:50:49
They absolutely do not sign the same updated balance sheet. They have separate copies. This is the reason why you can't publish an old state. The updated balance sheet gives information how to get the whole balance from the other party if they publish an old state.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:33:38
Correct. I think that in this scenario it is of outmost importance that people don't know about ECC being broken. However, if these double-spend transactions suddenly appear, everyone will know quite soon and I'd imagine the Bitcoin network would be halted until a workaround has been introduced.
I think it is fairly unlikely this scenario happens since we will most likely get a heads up because a quantum computer would be first used for other purposes.
However, it is still important to use a single address only once because of the added security P2PKH provides over P2PK.
Interesting question nevertheless!
@_date: 2019-01-02 10:45:00
You cannot rig the difficulty change in Bitcoin. Difficulty is changed only every 2016 blocks. Also, the blocks contain timestamps, so you would essentially need to mine those 2016 blocks very slow to have a retarget. Say, you do that. Still, difficulty cannot drop more than to a quarter than what it was before. Note: this is a security measure in Bitcoin which is not there in some alt-coins such as Ethereum. A retarget attack works against Ethereum, but not Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-01-29 12:56:09
That makes no sense whatsoever. Why would the wallets make a bigger transaction when sending to 3.. addresses?
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:16:53
I love LN and I'm a Bitcoin maximalist, but I'm not sure what you're saying makes sense. The security from LN comes from the fact that you can make an on-chain transaction if the counterparty tries to rollback the state. The cost of the on-chain transaction must be less than the funds locked in the multisig contract.
So either a) on-chain transactions can't be too expensive b) we need layer 3 on top of LN or c) we need something else.

There are many things wrong with increasing the blocksize, on the biggest problems being the possible growth of the UTXO set.


Bingo. SegWit helps battling the UTXO set growth. In SegWit the transaction ID no longer contains the signatures. Therefore, the UTXO data per transaction is smaller.
Note: The blockchain can be pruned, but the UTXO set cannot.

The biggest lie I've seen are the numerous articles and blog posts about how in Bitcoin you can only make transactions that send bitcoin from one address to another. If people would know how Bitcoin really works, all alts would die instantly (expect for maybe one or two that are actually trying something new such as Monero).
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:35:00
No. There is another thing wrong in the video: You cannot end the payment channel without also the other party signing.
However, there is a security measure in place for the special case where the other party vanishes / lose their keys (for example, hardware failure). After a specified amount of blocks, the settlement transaction becomes valid without the signing of the other party. Your LN node must see the attempt to publish the old settlement transaction during this time. If your LN node succeeds, you get all the funds from the channel.

I don't understand, what do you mean by "decentralized standpoint"?

And to elaborate further, the important thing is how much security is added per newly minted block. The more it costs to create the block, the more security we have (because it increases the cost of creating a competing chain).
Bitcoin doesn't care how energy is spent, but how much that energy costs. If we want a greener planet, we need to have higher cost of electricity.

I agree with your first statement. I think this video just crosses the line. The video that simplifies things could just show a complicated contract that gets updated. Even better yet, it should show the user experience instead of trying to describe the technology behind it when it misses the most important part why it works in the first place.
There are loads of Bitcoin maximalists who try to fix misinformation, but it's super hard. I have seen lots of people on trying to explain how things work, but the reception is always "why do all Bitcoin maximalists always hold a grudge against ETH" and a ton of downvotes. Myself I have not been going to other subreddits to fix misconception, but I've tried to do it with people I know in real life. It's next to impossible and I have no idea why.
Just 2 days ago a colleague said "in Bitcoin you can't mix your transactions with transactions from others in order to hide your trails, but with a smart contract from Ethereum it should be possible". I tried to explain CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions, but to no avail.

This is incorrect. Say, you want to double spend the standard amount 6 blocks worth. This means that for 6 blocks you need to have more than 100% of the rest of the Bitcoin network. The cost of pulling the attack off is exactly that of the cost of the energy.
Everything in your comment is correct except for this one crucial part which makes your analysis wrong.
And to be fair, you didn't even explain how the security in Bitcoin would work in your scenario.

Agreed. I'm not sure Bitcoin is the solution, but I'm hopeful it contributes to trying out alternatives to what we have today.
I've always been skeptical of ideas like "trickle down economics" and fear of the deflatory spiral. During my lifetime, I just haven't seen our current system work the way it's advertised to. Unemployement is up, animals are treated very badly, the nature is not doing well, the average Joe is getting poorer and yet the richest are getting richer simply by distributing their investments. The system is rigged and unfair.
I'm quite convinced the economy can't grow forever, no matter what central banks do. It would be better to end keynesianism. But the rich are in control of the banks, what can the average Joe do? I can buy and hold Bitcoin.

Fair enough!
I have to admit that left-wing politics are a broad concept and I'm not even fully versed into all the different ideologies myself. Rather, I call myself leftist because I live in a country that has many things that most Americans would classify as extremely leftist and yet I fully support them. For example, we have public healthcare, free education (including University) and you even get paid for going to school! Furthermore, most people here trust the police and we have extremely low rates of police brutality.
However, I have to admit that free market economy is awesome when it works, and restrictions or subsidiaries are horrible when they don't. To be honest, I am very sour over the subsidized and restricted housing market that we have. People who can't afford living will get public money which - as a consequence - sets a floor for the housing price, which seems to mostly benefit investors. Furthermore, our capital restricts the quantity of new housing buildings meaning that the supply doesn't meet the demand.
Then again, we currently have a right-wing government, which wants to split up the massive public healthcare system into smaller parts. They want to do this so that the smaller parts could be produced by private companies which would then, in theory, be more efficient since they are driven by a free market. However, looking at how efficient our public healthcare is right now and comparing it to healthcare in countries where it is provided by a free market, I am extremely skeptical any efficiency would be achieved by this reorganization.
Anyway, even though I would have a lot more examples, I think this is getting very off-topic so I think I'll stop here. :-)

I think this is (one of) the reason(s) they didn't publish the data. Just because you can see the coins leave MtGox, then x amounts of transactions moving around the coins only to end up at some exchange doesn't mean the owner of the coins was the same all the way.
I wasn't around at 2011 and 2012, but I would assume many did bitcoin trading outside of the exchanges. Just like I would assume many do it now as well.
But this lead should absolutely be investigated by law enforcement. It's still a very solid lead. I just hope the skills of the law enforcement investigators are solid, too...

What makes you so convinced that you don't contribute anything?
Many investors and investing instruments provide good things. For example, if you short/long Bitcoin, it's good since it provides price discovery, which contributes to stability.
I think that mostly trading with instruments that are based on other instruments causing a cascaded system no-one fully understands is bad. Most investing provides positive value to the society.

Me too.
I heard of Bitcoin the first time in something like 2010, dismissed it totally as a "virtual nerd game". Second time in the sumner of 2012. It wasn't until 2013 I heard about the fixed supply and deflatory nature that I got interested.
Anyway, it is still early days and if Bitcoin works out everyone investing now and hodling will become rich.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:10:19
Yeah, but as a result I would assume many are hoarding fiat. I assume that because I'm doing it. Once we start seeing stable increase in the price it will go up quite fast and far.
Remember that because of the mining reward decrease scheme Bitcoin is destined to either go up in value or fail.

He didn't blame Bitcoin at any point. Initially, he incorrectly blamed Microsoft for the broken extension, but now he has corrected that it's the creators of the extension - which, by the way, is already patched.
Furthermore, he acknowledged that he made mistakes himself, too. And is even more harsh in pointing out how dumb the whole scenario is.

I'm leftist and pro grovernment, but I'd still like to see our monetary politics changed. I can understand why people want to make the connection between Bitcoin enthusiasts and anti-government people, but especially because of that I'd like to point out you can be one without the other.
I'm leftist since I think everyone should have an equal quality of life, and I think a deflatory currency that can't be manipulated by politicians and banksters would help distribute wealth more fair.

One of the corner stones of a real democracy is the ability to not vote at all or to cast an invalid vote. If the voting rate is less than 50% one can raise the philosophical question whether the vote result has any power at all. This is exactly the reason why candidates or proponents of ideas in real democracies say it's most important to vote and only the second most important thing is to vote what they represent.

You are right that Bitcoin is based on consensus. That is why forking is such a bad idea and frowned upon.
Consensus means that all have to agree or no change is introduced. I think it is a great idea because it provides robustness and predictability.

Players are matched based on Elo rating and I think this would be a big problem in your idea. The obvious problem is smurfing. But let's pretend we come up with an idea how to prevent people from smurfing.

Inflation is theft and it makes sure that without increasing exploitation of the environment and without technological advancements, the working class will have to work harder and harder to earn the same share. Historically, technological advancements have meant that employees can do their work more efficiently. However, today automation is starting to kick in which means the employee is replaced altogether.

Well, first of all, miners are always selling. For all intents and purposes, you should always base your market analysis on the assumption that 100% of newly minted bitcoin are being sold. Fortunately, the inflation ratio of Bitcoin is decreasing, as designed.
Furthermore, it is typical that in a bear market weak hands are being shaken off. Not everyone invests only what they can afford to lose. Also, some investors see that they can make better trades elsewhere, even if they eventually would have to buy back in at higher prices.
So, the motives for selling at these prices are definitely there. The question no-one knows the answer for is: how low will we go and when do we have the next rally, if ever.
