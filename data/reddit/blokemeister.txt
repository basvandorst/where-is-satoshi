you've been wrong every time so far, at least you're dedicated to making the same poor decision over and over.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:22:35
most day traders fail. They either make some bad decisions, or they just get eaten by fees. Buy and hold has been a good strategy, but with crypto you never know. Buy some real assets in something you actually have an interest/knowledge in. 
Stop gambling on magic internet money if you want to save yourself some pain. Make concessions to your living today so you are safe when you can no longer work by putting more into your 401k or whatever equivalent your country has.
Or just keep gambling, whatever.

after months of screaming about lambos, moons, blockchain magic, fiat evil moneys and demanding everyone buy bitcoin, the price crashed and they told me i'm stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:14:45
google 'the story of tether', those words should suffice. Then think carefully about what they have done in the past month, the current supply that exists, the lack of any evidence that this money actually exists and their refusal to provide any. And also have a look at the fine print on bitfinex, and also for shits and giggles, get yourself some tether and see if you can withdraw it for usd on the exchange.
Have fun!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:06:06

what evidence are you looking for? The only people that can produce evidence that the money is real is the people who control tether. The evidence that exists is merely persuasive in saying that this is a complete bullshit scam as they try to use a ToU to free themselves of any legal liability when it goes to shit all the while printing money faster than fiat while not letting anyone look at their books or submitting the audit report that apparently exists.
Not my problem if you aren't smart enough to figure out the scam.

i think my favourite part is the 3 step program for acquiring bitcoins and then doing absolutely nothing with them, it's basically the whole cryptocurrency ideology streamlined.

they don't care, they are bots. Their one and only mission is to spread bullshit about bitcoin being great. When in reality every single fact about bitcoin points to it being complete garbage. Insane fees, stupid transaction times, completely inconvenient to buy and hold, not to mention sell, extremely volatile, 0 force holding up its value or enforcing people to accept it, shady as fuck exchanges that can pretty much do whatever the hell they want, the cost to process transactions in power output is ridiculous.
Wake up and smell the bullshit.

In a roundabout way, you seem to think it's a conspiracy against bitcoin, but the reality is they don't give two shits about bitcoin, it is merely another tool for making profit. 
If they cared about bitcoin and really destroying it they would constantly remind you the facts about bitcoin that let you know it is a total garbage investment right now and possibly forever depending on how it all shakes out. They don't care about the fate of bitcoin, merely blowing smoke for the banks.

some nominal amounts of bits and a few satoshi's, probably note in your transaction that you expect it to be processed within 2 sargons to ensure miners are aware of the utmost urgency of your transactions.
