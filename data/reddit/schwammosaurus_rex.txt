Nope, because you are fundamentally not wrong, but neither right. I'm just fed up with the endless discussions around the topic.
r/btc vs. r/bitcoin has always been a pain and the fork brought nothing good with it apart from adding fuel to the fire.

Thanks a lot for the fast reply! But this kinda raised a few more questions for me:
- The bitcoin address derives from the public key? I thought they are the same?
- I understand that the private address is very random, but that doesn't mean it is unique, does it? THEORETICALLY would there not be a chance of 1:[very big number] for the private key already existing?
- If the public address derives from the private one, is it then not possible to invert the process and get private keys just by knowing the public addresses?
- How to clients know the private key is correct when I import them from a cold / papet wallet when it never synchronised with the bitaddress generator?
Sorry for so many questions, as you might have guessed I'm still kinda new and try to get my head around as many aspects of BTC as possible.

Even though you seem biased against r/btc (I don't blame you), you have a point. I am indeed not too familiar with moterating or even being part of very large online communities, so thanks for sharing this info with me.
Anyways, although I understand that moderating and deleting posts and comments is necessary, there are several instances where I think the policy here should be looser. I appreciate an open discussion and think people with different opinions should be able to raise / discuss them, too. 
But I understand the issues which come with this and don't know of a better way of moderating. I am just surprised that a controverse community like this gets promoted.

Thanks a lot, made things a bit clearer for me!
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:16:50
I did not say that r/btc is a good subreddit. I've just read a few stories/info about moderation / censorship here and came to the conclusion that I don't agree with several instances of deleting comments / banning people, etc.
This should not be seen as a complaint, each to their own and this is still a usefull subreddit to a certain degree. I am just surprised that a subreddit gets praised like this from Reddit itself, ignoring all the controversy around it.
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:00:31
Exactly what I thought. Bitcoin is great but not so sure about r/bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:23:43
If it is an amount that would seriously bother you if lost, then store cold. Exchanges can get hacked, go bankrupt, etc. They are just private companies, not banks.

Spotted the German!
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:29:13
Fair enough, never heard of it abroads, whereas in Germany it seems to be the go-to prestige item for every mid-aged housewife ;) they are good though.

TIL Thermomix blenders are known outside of Germany. The prices are ridiculous though so I don't think you need to buy one just because the presenter was a sound dude

For our fellow British readers: BILD is the German twin of the SUN. Right-winged, over exaggerating, run by people with their very own interests, not rarely making up numbers and references. Look for other sources or ignore.

I guess you are referring to issues like the MtGox collapse? That was indeed concerning me, I will have a look into how to store BTC offline, thanks.
I agree with your second point. It sounds it's more like buying into an idea rather than buying some shares.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:19:21
Thanks for your reply. I am currently in the process of doing that and have a rough idea of how it works. I understand possible issues to it's future value like Trump and the EU trying to ban it. I am not expecting to get rich, I believe these golden days are over but rather looking into an alternative to a savings account - with higher risk and possibly higher interest.
Any specific tips / ideas what I should be aware of?
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:08:47
I'll have a look, thanks! Currently looking into Bitkey first for storage of the coins
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:39:59
You are basically saying stick to them as long as possible as a long-term investment? Sorry I'm not sure I fully understood your comment
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:35:27
I understand, it is more like buying into the idea(logy) of the currency of the future rather than buying some shares. I am careful with taking and giving financial advice, but a collective of opinions is surely a first step of informing myself. Thanks

Can we please stop with this hodl circle jerk? Just keep em if you want but don't hold on for the sake of it. There are good reasons to, but “just because hodl“ isn't one of them.
Sounds like a creepy cult mentality at most or people being desperate for the price to go up

That's why you go for onion rings and order at a time when the network isn't too occupied for fast transactions!

Hush, before anyone notices. Reddit doesn't like plugs!
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:06:17
Not sure but I think a computer related sub would be better suited than the botcoin one. You can check the subreddit rules on the top right. This one is for discussions and news around BTC
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:46:38
I am NOT an expert. But my HD got corrupted toba state where I couldn't boot anymore last year. I would be surprised if the data clinic hasn't done something similar yet but it's easy to do and you don't have anything to lose if you give it a shot:
Download knoppix (an basic OS based on linux, freeware) and save it as a bootable OS (ISO-file) on a DVD. Set your boot setup to boot from disk first. Boot. Connect an external HD / USB stick / whatever and transfer all the files accesible from your internal corrupted HD to the external one.
Let me know if you have any questions, I hope it helps!
P.S.: I think this is the wrong subreddit for your problem so I hope you read this before it gets deleted

Nah, when I panic, I just hodl ;)
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:14:19
Thanks for the awesome advice! I'll re-think my strategy and try to play a bit safer

What makes it less stable than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:15:22
You are full on correct so I edited my post just in case the /s didn't come through fully

If not cashed out yet than I would probably hold on it right now. But who knows, might be worthless tomorrow (I don't have 330k, I wish)
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:02
Sorry I think that was me. Bought as well because FOMO and whenever I try to predict the market the opposite happens. Now back to hodl till I can sell at a profit :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:12:16
Fingers crossed. In the worst case I just have a couple of days without worrying when to sell or buy ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:53:41
I just googled gbtc and don't quite get it. What is it? For your question: I think it will continue up. For now...
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:04:49
Where are you based? The biggest ones are usually the most reliable ones too. But it might take a while until your ID got confirmed (which is required more or less everywhere)
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:02:38
Nah was only a comparatively small amount for day trading. Otherwise I wouldn't be in the mood for memes. Will just take a bit longer than expected till I can sell at 2750
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:28:28
Nah that was what I had spare for now. Waiting to break even now before I invest more. Just gutted I missed the dip but I guess that's part of the game
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:30:08
I felt overly optimistic in the beginning of the year and put down a prediction of BTC reaching 2000$ within June. I wrote the money off already but now it's getting so close! Don't crash quite yet pleaseee!
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:27:49
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:59:08
Like those accounts linked to the gold price? Seems overly complicated in this case, I think I'll stick to the real deal ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:25:09
Yep, missed all those sweet cheap coins
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:46:50
Even if your comment isn't full on serious, maybe consider cashing out a portion?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:28:20
I'm pretty sure he meant 1 BTC...
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:57:43
You must have hands of steel. Does it not tickle you to sell now and buy back more at a cheaper price?
