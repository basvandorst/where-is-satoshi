I really hope they jump on board with this.  Integrating it into their Google play store would be great for them and everyone else.  I would immediately start spending my bitcoins on several things there, and I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one.

I meant to mention that as well. There can always be a healthy combination of the two, but it will become less of an "investment," IMO, once the real value of bitcoin is realized and it is adopted by a majority of merchants. The more people who have "invested" in bitcoin going forward will hopefully someday realize they can easily use it instead of fiat for most of their goods, and the volatility will then be greatly reduced. The larger the ocean, the less effect a drop makes.

Edit - Um...try thinking of it as digital cash that is decentralized and (more or less) the same value across the globe. This helps with currency exchange rates and government inflation/deflation, and is basically immune to much of that type of stuff, but it's not without it's own dangers....? I really don't know how to explain it to anyone of any age. I told my coworker about it today and she basically just laughed. Here's a link that might be [able to explain it better.](

So if I had 10,000,000btc and sent them to a non-existent address, what would that do to the market? Just curious. My first thought is that the value would skyrocket, and I would jump off a very tall building (assuming I did it on accident).

Try localbitcoins. I haven't used but it's supposed to be pretty simple, relatively. I would suggest getting on the train before it goes even higher, but your money is your money. I wish I had more to buy in right now, but I guess I'll have to wait for a big correction at some point. You just never know when that will happen, or how low it goes..

@_date: 2013-11-17 01:56:49
I've told a coworker about it, and so now she asks "How's your monopoly money doing?" :-/     I also told my cousin-in-law about it and helped him set up an account at Coinbase and gave him $5.00 of btc. He really likes the idea but is terrified of it at the same time. I told him the usual stuff like don't throw in more than you can afford to lose and do as much research on it as possible. So I guess I'm batting .500?
And just for the record, if someone did what you did to me (before I knew about bitcoin) I'd probably think they're nuts, but I also *hate* talking to strangers irl...

^ This is correct. I wish I had a Visa credit card just for this purpose. It's not terrible that you have to wait for them to be added to your account, but it does suck if you want to buy more unexpectedly and you can't because you're waiting for the pending transaction to go through. Hopefully they'll change this (or at least shorten it) in the future.

GSpotAssassin donated an entire btc last night to the guy running the btc food charity from the "bitcoins still feed people" thread. There are some real generous people in this subreddit.

@_date: 2013-11-09 03:40:30
Almost, but a lot more complicated/time-consuming than that. I bought about $165 worth (after fees and such) and my 0.59223858 BTC is now worth $200. I'm not pulling out anytime soon, and I hope I can afford to one day have a whole bitcoin! /dream
Edit - just went down to $186 :/ 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:23:10
Its been a while since it was that low - not to say it won't happen again, but I would wait for it to hopefully go down to $300 rather than $200, otherwise you might never invest.. I suggest watching the charts constantly and get a feel for the momentum of it all. Then, decide when you want to throw your hat in the ring. Bitcoinity.org is a good chart to look at. The best you can do is inform yourself and *try* to put your money in at the perfect time. In the meantime, get a wallet set up somewhere and be ready.

Right now I have a sad 0.59223858 BTC, but I'm waiting (and hoping) for the price to drop a bit so I can put more in there. I didn't feel comfortable enough with putting more than $200 at the time, but now I'm regretting it..
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:58:11
Yeah that's true. Mine was from the same account. Maybe that was another reason they didn't let me use it. It's weird that they would allow some but not all, though.

@_date: 2013-11-21 20:54:12
With bitcoin, I see crashes as a good thing (as scary as they are sometimes). It usually means people can jump in for a relatively good deal. Also, each crash that has happened so far hasn't brought the price down below the ATH that was experienced with the previous crash, and I think that's a very good indicator of where bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:20:05

lol if you think 800 is normal you are crazy! it's currently the peak of parabolic growth.. it may continue past 800 and 800 will seem "cheap" and then BOOM the crash happens and everyone is like "damn i cant believe i spent 800 when i could have bought for **600**"

Probably pretty invested. I have only fractions of btc throughout a couple different wallets. But I'm sure a lot of people here have more. You bought in at a relatively low price (emphasis on relatively), and I can't imagine we've seen the peak yet. In any case, I wish you the best of luck. Spending btc only helps the cause, so go for it. But personally, I would tell you to hold on to at least some of it.

I bought some btc last week at ~$400, and got them on the day they told me I would, with an instant 180% return due to the value going back up by then. I can only imagine that a lot of their transactions that actually go through without a hitch don't get ranted about on Reddit. Calling them a *scam* seems fairly inaccurate. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:06:42

Hmm, I just figured they did at one point because I saw it [here]( and when I attempted to get it verified a week ago they didn't give me the message they gave me today. It *seemed* to have gone through, but obviously didn't. 
Edit - and it's not really a reason to downvote a post. Other people *might* be in a similar situation waiting for Coinbase to verify their debit card.

If you are desperate to get a bitcoin as soon as possible, you can purchase them with PayPal at eobot.com. It's pretty quick and easy, but sadly you have to wait 45 days to be able to withdraw it or send it to other wallets. You can switch back and forth from USD to BTC to LTC and all the other digital currencies within the site right away. Each conversion will cost you 5% but at least you can get your feet wet as soon as possible,
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:22:43
Yeah me neither. I'm happy with my Discover It card. Apparently at one point you could use a Visa debit card, but when I tried it it never got verified, and then I tried again and they told me they won't accept debit cards. Yet others swear you can use one..

This post again...if I wanted to see reposts I'd stick to On a nicer note - It's never too late to invest in Bitcoin, but don't put more money in than you can stand to lose. There's a sweet spot between too little and too much. Find your personal sweet spot and go in as soon as you can, and DO NOT PANIC SELL once/if you see the price dip a bit.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:54:23

@_date: 2013-11-09 05:50:47
You make a very astute observation. I'm sure there are a few financial institutions that have done the math and realize how much BTC could hurt their bottom-line in the future. Any blowback that can dissuade someone from buying is worth a little pocket change to them.

I was half-kidding, but personally, I think the value is going to go pretty high in the next month. Interest in bitcoin is increasing, and who knows how many people will buy bitcoins for the holidays. Then again...people may cash out for holiday money, too. Ultimately it's your call, and your money. I'm not actually a doctor, I just play one on reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:13:20
This happens with Coinbase from time to time. They have to "free up" other bitcoins somehow (and for some reason). It's been explained before but I wouldn't do the explanation justice.

I did the same thing. It sucks to have to wait 45 days, but I don't plan on doing much with my btc for a while anyway. I just wish I could convert portions of my btc to ltc. As of right now, I'm not sure how to do that.

@_date: 2013-11-15 09:01:39
I bought ~$175 worth (~0.599btc) about a little over a week ago after procrastinating for quite a while. I wish I had bought some sooner, but most people late to the game feel this way..my ~0.599btc is now worth ~$242. You live and learn... 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:47:24
It seems like it. I'm scared....If it keeps going down I'm definitely going to buy some more. It's not terrible news really. I plan on keeping my 0.59223858 BTC in for at least a month. Still scared though...someone hold me...
Edit to add:  My *uneducated* guess is that people in China are waking up and seeing the price and thinking "sell sell sell!" Which will only make people say "$300?? BUY BUY BUY!"

@_date: 2013-11-23 04:20:15
This is true. I've had to talk to banks about releasing authorizations on cancelled orders, and most will straight up tell you that you can't do anything to speed it up. Other banks will let you fax them something to speed it up (rarely). Every bank really is different, but most are douches.
That doesn't mean that Coinbase should be immune to all criticism. If they are such a large company, they should be hiring a ton more people to help with customer service. Not responding to your customers is one of the worst things you can do as a company.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:51:04
Actually there's a limit to how many btc coinbase will let you buy at first, but since OP asked how many can they buy per dollar, I doubt it will be an issue..

Click on the "Buy/Sell" button to the left, and then click on "Limits and Verifications" over to the right. You should be able to scroll down and see your current level and what you have to verify in order to become level 2 verified for instant purchases. I'm stuck on verifying my identity. They throw some pretty tricky questions at you, and you can only attempt the test once every 24 hours.
