The difficulty reduction will happen on both forks in the chain, to varying degrees (unless the global hash rate magically increases to the exact amount necessary to reach parity with pre-fork rates in each new fork).
I do think that a clear winner will emerge soon after a fork though, as I can't picture miners carrying on with a clearly lost cause (whichever side that may be).

I'm glad you asked. I meant no smugness by my comment by the way. It's just that I used to be confused by those terms because I heard them used in various ways, and just assumed they meant the same thing. I felt compelled to point it out.
in ELI5 terms, the [Turing Test]( is simply a test of the effectiveness of a computer program or machine at imitating a human. A person is supposed to try to discern which of the two they are communicating with (a computer or a human) without seeing them (text only communication).
[Turing completeness]( has to do with the power of a computer / programming language. There is also something called Turing equivalency which is useful in comparing languages. You can read more specifically about these things on wikipedia (linked), or elsewhere.

While both entertaining and thought provoking, it is important to remember that there is no real distinction on the blockchain between coins residing in addresses with lost or forgotten private keys, and those that simply go unspent due to user inactivity.
We can never have any certainty that specific unspent coins are gone forever, even though we can be very confident that some coins, somewhere, will be lost and gone forever.

I just wanted to point out that the Turing test (of an AI) and Turing completeness (of a language or machine) are two entirely separate concepts. That is all.

This is the comment I was looking for. Especially  Many of the FUDy claims about the dangers of 20Mb seem to skim over this detail, or blatantly lie about it. It makes me think they have ulterior motives (lightning.. etc.).

Outlawing the "laying of fiber" doesn't seem a good answer in this analogy. Especially since the "laying of additional fiber" in this analogy doesn't incur additional costs (i.e. raising the limit to 8Mb or 20Mb is the same in terms of deployment).
I think the point is that 1Mb is arbitrary, and the idea that the solution to the bottle-neck is to price customers out is silly. Luckily, this project is open-source, so people have the freedom to do what they want.

This "probability" is a changing quantity. I'm fairly sure this is the quantity that sapiophile is saying that miners will be considering when they choose a side. Miners absolutely have an influence on the outcome, which is why the fork is even being discussed. Consensus is crucial to survival, and the feedback loops mentioned in point  will be very real.
One analogy (not a perfect one, I admit) is the World Hockey Association (WHA) competing with National Hockey League (NHL). There is a large network effect, which can cause instability at times of close parity, and magnified trends resulting in a clear "winner".
There are, of course, counter-examples. E.g. Facebook vs. G+ comes to mind, in that G+ struggles to gain the same userbase that Facebook has, despite being more innovative in many areas. In this "analogy", there are core differences in philosophy about the networks.
While I consider both of these types of scenarios possible after a hard fork (i.e. domination by one, or long lasting survival of both forks), I consider the first scenario much more likely. My reasoning is that these two forks are otherwise similar (they don't reflect some binding cultural differences that will never go away), and one's bitcoin in the pre-fork chain is valid in either chain they choose. In any case, we'll see when it happens, but I wouldn't go flat out telling anyone that they are "Wrong." No one is that certain of what will happen.

This! The proof of chronology that the blockchain offers will change the world!

I'm wondering the same. Supposing the gold was on the Moon, my first thought is that the main cost would be getting the extra fuel out of Earth's gravity, that would be necessary to get the gold out of the Moon's gravity. There are obviously lots of other things to consider.. but those are the first big costs I'm thinking in terms of variable costs.
Then, assuming it could even be worthwhile, one would have to bring back enough gold to make the fixed costs less relevant. But going to far in that direction would also reduce the scarcity of gold.
Maybe the proper play would be to hedge against gold, and then bring back lots of it? Haha.. there are so many variables.. it's hard to even think about.
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:02:07
This just made me think of something interesting. I wonder if this thought experiment exists somewhere:
Suppose it was discovered that the Moon was made of mostly gold. What immediate effect would this have on the price / value of gold on Earth?
On one hand, the actual scarcity of gold on Earth would remain intact until someone began shipping gold back to Earth (would the trip be worth it?) Would the mere knowledge that all that gold is there for the taking affect prices here, via speculation? Could it even be worth the trip to bring gold back?

If there is a hard fork, I don't expect one chain to last very long. All the pre-fork coins are still valid on both chains, and the system seems to be very feed-back oriented, and thus would likely act as an unstable attractor. Pre-fork coins could be spent on both new forks, as the post fork histories are exclusive of one another. In a sense, 1 pre-fork coin would be worth exactly 1 of each post-fork coins.

When you say:


can you explain how that would work? I thought that the larger side would "win". If the miners keeping the original block subsidy only make up 34%, why wouldn't they be the "altcoin"? I'm not trying to argue, just legitimately curious. Is this because there are far more nodes than miners, or something along those lines?

Also, consider what it says in the 4th paragraph under "The San Bernardino Case":


This subtly implies that there *already exists* a backdoor. Otherwise, this statement would not ~~   ~~ could not be true.

I did. Not impressed.

Ok, I didn't mean to say I wasn't impressed with Monero. I admit I was being a little curt out of frustration. What I should have said was, despite knowing about Monero, and the education about security and cryptography one might infer from that, such informed thought is not evident in this particular discussion.

I fully understand what Tim Cook means. I'm saying that Apple's ability to even update a phones OS is a backdoor, IMO.
Consider a different security model: one in which a user has a passphrase at boot which decrypts the partition containing user data. With such a system, even if Apple was forced at gunpoint to "unlock someones phone with new software", they would not be capable of doing so.
The fact that they are currently capable, but not *willing* to do so, to me, is a backdoor.
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:17:28
I makes sense to someone who *understands*. Let me try to explain it simply. If the hypothetical software "which does not exist today" is even possible, it means that Apple has a means of accessing customers device data.
Think it through, logically.
@_date: 2016-02-18 03:39:33
You can simply not update your phone, unless it is not in your possession. The current security model is still not a "trustless" model. A user still must trust Apple. In contrast to an information security model having a user-encrypted data partition to which Apple has no special privilege, the current model is not ideal.
It would be better if Apple could say to the FBI, "we wouldn't do this for you and we *can't* do this for you". Instead of, "we could do this, but we won't".
@_date: 2016-02-17 22:28:48
That's correct. The very fact that Apple can, at will, push an update to any device to gain access via a "backdoor" is, in my opinion, a backdoor.
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:23:23
While I agree with you, in principle, I do believe the "hackers" or "unfriendly foreign countries" arguments serve as a means to convince those that blindly adhere to the notion that the government will act in their best interest.
In other words, these extra worries are a catch-all to convince the poorly informed masses that backdoors are a terrible idea.
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:30:33
Just wanted to confirm that you are correct. I hate that you are down voted, and it makes me think poorly of the folks in this thread. I have googled BTC so many times, and the price doesn't show up in the search results until I google something like BTC price. I have noted this "soft-censorship" numerous times, and I believe it could be related to competing projects like google wallet.
Sorry guys, but google is not always the good guy.
