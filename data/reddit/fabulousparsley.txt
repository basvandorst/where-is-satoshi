A money that is barely usable
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:22:30
Well it better get started sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:41:42
This presupposes that nothing better than bitcoin will ever come along and that once all the bitcoin has been mined it will still be the most in demand crypto. Remind me again which v1 technology has retained it's place at the head of the pack in perpetuity. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:21:48
Yeah and it could hit $0 or $1M or 40 cents. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:47:40
Lol banks aren’t running scared and they’re not going anywhere. Regardless of bitcoins success. Not as many people hate the banks as you’ve deluded yourself into believing. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:24:04
No one knows! it's use changes to whatever is most convenient for the argument at hand. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:18:56
Ahh the classic I have no idea what inflation really is, but will cite inflation anyway, argument for bitcoin. A classic go-to on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:36:57
Someone will be right eventually. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:44:36
Ahh, the old stocks are overvalued but some near useless internet coin which there are now thousands of is not line of reasoning. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:27:10
OP can’t do nothing right 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:40:45
Yeah, just a coincidence....
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:14:21
lol, regulatory development. Isn't one of the underlying fundamentals of bitcoin it's ability to be unregulated and decentralized? How are bitcoin supporters now claiming regulation is a good thing? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:17:10
Maybe if your data set this sub
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:36:41
If you’re so confident you’ve figured out how to time bitcoin you should put every last cent you have into it. Otherwise, just admit to yourself that no one has any fucking clue what the bottom is. Especially you. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:18:07
Okay and? Does that mean it has some majority support or millions lining up to take their money out of the banks and convert it to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:37:04
I see you use the term “invest” very loosely
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:20:22
Yeah, Buffet is just a hack with access
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:58:38
Yeah but why let facts get in the way of a cool looking graph with no context. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:05:35
Yeah, because bitcoin has proven to be a stable, easily used currency. Or is it a medium of exchange? Or is it a store of value? Tough to keep track. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:24:43
Really well said. Anyone who screams hodl just thinks bitcoin is a get rich quick scream. I’d actually respect the community a lot more if people just owned it. But sadly they don’t. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:54:00
Oh so people who believe in bitcoin trust bitcoin. Good news reporting. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:20:07
This guy's post is so absurdly hypocritical it's scary that people's brains can actually work this way.   
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:20:10
Fuck Wikileaks. They are an ally to no one. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:18:42
This has to be a troll post. It's so hypocritical and pseudo intellectual it is actually comical. It screams, "I've lost a ton on bitcoin holding and think I can wish the price up."
Your entire post is a call to buy bitcoin because it's against the tide of some evil "collective" and shows the inability to exercise agency. 
Yet, while you ramble about how people should think for themselves you are too blind/ignorant/delusion (take your pick) to understand you're entire post is only asking them to follow your own direction. So I guess people should exercise agency in so far as it's in line with your personal beliefs. Otherwise you're just another sheep, right?
Do you really think this post is going to help you make back the money you have lost over the last couple of months? Because it's a pretty weak, albeit transparent attempt. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:02:10
Interesting reality you have created for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:31:15
So did the people at Long Term Capital Management. Ask them how it went. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:32:09
Who is spending and on what?
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:25:00
I mean, Assange has done everything short of pledging allegiance to Russia. Wikileaks is not just an threat to America but to the entire world in general. Anyone who still thinks they are non partisan or have the best interest of the people in mind is either ignorant or entirely delusional. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:03:30
Yeah, an agreement with you and a response to OP
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:47:57
I thought bitcoin was supposed to be a good hedge against the general market. Guess not. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:49:57
Calling bitcoin a currency is extremely generous. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:06:46
What are you talking about? This sub is a giant circle jerk when bitcoin is posting gains. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:06:23
Don't trade. Invest. Trying to time the market is futile.
