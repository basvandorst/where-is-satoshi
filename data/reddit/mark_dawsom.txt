it’s hilarious how the Bitcoin crowd initially was all about disrupting the banking industry and now you hear them cheering whenever some big name Wall Street bank says they’re getting into  crypto.

Whaaaat? Someone with deep pockets in a unregulated market can manipulate prices?! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:54:03
How is that relevant to “being your own bank”? My point is that it has turned into a major price circlejerk.

Holy fucking shit! You guys forgot the severe butt fucking you endured by Mt Gox? All the crying and whining all over the place? Wouldn't you have wished for your money back?  At least this team is looking after the community. Is a hard fork right to do? No but their attitude of not turning their head the other way is nothing but admirable and you Mt Gox rape victims should know that more than anyone else.

Couldn't find any report by Kaspersky Labs so yeah fuck this shit.
@_date: 2016-06-05 06:51:50
I wasn't referring to you mate. Now you know :)
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:57:36
Don't worry about it man. What happened?
@_date: 2016-06-12 08:34:46
Miners' reward will be halved so they either have to process more transactions I.e. mine more or have the price increase in order to stay profitable.

Sherlock got it.

Wait you actually waited for Teamviewer to get hacked in order to realize you shouldn't use it on the same computer?

I've read the text and the comments, they arrested him not for trading bitcoins, but for trading bitcoins *for US dollars*. Commercial exchanges in currencies other than the country's official currency are taxable.

ITT: People don't know what a loophole is.

Don't be quick to discard the whole of it. Tunisia, who kickstarted it, seems to be doing quite well.
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:01:53
They are not hard-forking. They are proposing a hard-fork. It's up for the community to decide, and unlike Bitcoin's centralised mining power (*puts on Trump mask* CHINA) Ethereum's isn't.

A big Smart Contract implementation had an unintended feature that someone exploited to transfer 3 millions ETH to another account, however the funds cannot be withdrawn yet so the "attacker"  won nothing from it directly. Why are you still reading about it here after 2 days? Butt hurt Mt Gox rape victims, who are ought to have empathy for the people who could **potentially** lose *some* of their money, need something to vent at.

Boy if I could go back in time to when Karpekes was jizzing on these people's faces..
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:45:19
So is your mom's ass. OHHHH
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:43:22
part of ETH?   Hacked? 
It's like calling the internet hacked because you defaced a single website.
It wasn't a hack.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:54:44
Okay, okay, I've seen this comparison a lot but I have no idea what the significance is. Why does this matter?
Market cap means two entirely different things for a company and a currency.
A more meaningful comparison would be the market cap of various bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:29:57
What? You mean consensus? But dude it's a blockchain! Hurr durr /s
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:08:43
Dude if I was referring to you I would've said so. There are always hundreds of people who adjust their fees and run into the same problem, I was talking about those. I didn't say you were one of them, I have nothing against you and I sincerely wish you all the best!
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:05:13
Huh? You do realize ETH was not hacked right?
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:14:55
Don't pay anyone anything! Your coins WILL return to you eventually. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:27:12
Most wallets do but that doesn't stop idiots from poking around thinking they've outsmarted the system. *sigh*
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:54:57
Either ways this can't be good for him. The media reported him as an authority that verified Wright's claim so this shows that he's either an accomplice or technically unreliable. As a core dev I think both are as bad.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:23:26
Why drag news-outlets into it if it's a geek's game? They could've posted it to the community and the news-outlets would've picked it up. Going directly to the media says something.
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:00:55
How much did they have in'em? lol
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:03:22
TIL I am a 21-year old who's jealous of 4-year olds for having cool dads.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:48:31
The only question now is was Gavin an accomplice or not.
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:35:51
U wot m8?

Oh yeah? Where's the blog post?

I see.
I was actually asking for an ELI5 explanation about Arrow's theorem cos I've seen it tossed around here quite often.
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:37:07
ELI5 please

Is he autistic?
Honest question.

Matonis here, why you keep forgetting about me :(
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:34:02
It's way simpler then the whole "Gavin was hacked" or "The Electrum network was compromised" scenarios. Plus say everyone bought the bait and believed Craig to be SN, I am almost sure SN will then come out in support of Gavin's block size agenda. So yeah.

It's to prevent double-spending. On page 8 of the [white paper]( you can see that the probability of success of a double-spend attack decreases exponentially as the number of confirmation increases. Why 6 precisely? I think it's because it was suggested early on.
