Unless I am mistaken, the Liquid code base isn't available for review so to make claims as to it's operation is a bit overreaching.
Confidential transactions break various portions of the protocol that require knowledge of the transaction value, such as dust prevention.
To get to the point, a federated sidechain solution is unacceptable in some high volume use cases such as what I am developing.  While it does address the needs of such volumes, sidechains are not even publicly prototyped and what you are suggesting requires that industries simply wait until the technology matures.  It took almost seven years for Bitcoin to mature to the point where it may be considered a truly immutable data store and serviceable for those applications which require it.  I would not trust the operations of a multi-billion dollar industry on a solution that isn't as well developed or mature as the Bitcoin blockchain as it currently stands.  It would simply be irresponsible.

The debate ignores realities which brought us to this point that are not events widely held in the public consciousness as being important or having value. 
It's the talking around these old, painful issues that have created the toxic environment we currently enjoy. 
There are still no sufficient economic incentives in Bitcoin to allow someone to admit they have an agenda or made a mistake.

1a) it's only a HF from a perspective of the protocol as dictated by the Core client. For BU it's just another block. 
1b) Perhaps, but my professional experience leads me to believe that there's a more elegant, pinpoint solution than what's on offer. YMMV
2) My business model is to use Bitcoin as it is designed and implemented. The rest of your commentary is, as such, invalid. 
3) To say that 4,800 lines of code that extend across a multiple areas of the protocol is "minimal" simply because it's being offered as a soft fork is simply inaccurate by any measure. 
4) I wouldn't donate to Wikileaks because I know John Young. I suggest you support  instead. Making specific examples means they may be defeated equally as specifically. 
Again, BU only creates a problem for Core clients that constrain block size through the consensus layer. It isn't a problem for BU or any client that removes the restriction.

That's one guy that makes money from making mining equipment and selling a consumer version.
Personality politics makes it easier to dismiss points of view that disagree with your own.  
If Bitcoin is a truly trustless system then the names don't matter and the data reigns supreme. 
The data says there's a miner's decision being made in regard to protocol implementations that is not trivial and involves a high degree of risk. 
Depersonalize the discussion to the core (pun intended) facts and the toxicity vanishes and we all actually have something to discuss constructively. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:21:12
I'm a "fork it" guy. Two implementations strengthens Bitcoin as it entrenches standards in the protocol. I don't see any problem with two implementations but the fact cannot be ignored that cooperation is always more efficient and therefore profitable. Conflict costs money. Collaboration saves money. There are software development paradigms that don't disappear just because a blockchain is involved. 
Edit to add: my only criticism is in that collaboration should  not be replaced with cloistered competition.

Not in the manner suggested such as a poison block attack, no.
Let's assume EC becomes a thing and miners can select a block size. 
What incentive do miners have to allow for blocks which do not validate in a reasonable amount of time?
I would offer they have none, and assuming I'm correct that a simpler solution may be implemented to solve that problem that it would behoove miners to solve it. That takes the pressure off of other to find a solution to problems they don't have to live with.

That wasn't specifically stated and I'm not about to make assumptions or jump to conclusions on such a hot button topic. 
If you believe that LN nodes will not be subject to regulation then I have a bridge to sell you as such thinking is completely naive. Any regulations that currently apply to payment processors may very well apply to LNs since they perform the exact same function but using different code. If you're suggesting that there will be so many LNs that they will be unstoppable then we go right back to high fees to move between LN segments and it's a brand new problem and I have evidence of Nazi bases on the moon that may interest you.

If you're under the impression that Bitcoin achieved its position through anything other than a collective of human beings then everything we've ever been told about Bitcoin is a lie. 
There are no protocol standards for Bitcoin. These conversations are as much a part of Nakamoto Consensus as the code, itself.

Now it's gets more and more complex and the appeal to everyday people starts to go down and that has nothing to do with the fact you're attempting to circumvent the law.

1) True, however this is a problem right now as has already happened. It has nothing to do with block size, but the inputs used. Larger blocks do not make such an event any more or less likely. I would suggest there is more than likely a possible solution that doesn't require 4,800 lines of code.
2) This is a straw man argument. My application for the music industry utilizes on chain transactions for payment verification. This verification lasts forever, meaning you never lose license to your music so long as you never lose your keys. LN is insufficient for this purpose because it's not a data store with potential permanence as a blockchain is.
3) There's no rule which says that every single aspect of the protocol is required for every single application. The current implementation of segregating data via witness forces every implementation to comply with that alteration: from simple address validators to OpenBazaar. This argument of economics is from simply a so narrow perspective as to be wholly inaccurate.
4) While attractive from a crypto-anarchist point of view, federated instant payment networks work just fine now. I can send BTC from my AirBitz wallet to a BitPay enabled vendor in zero confirms. There's little difference between BitPay and a LN from a consumer point of view and BitPay (and Coinbase and GoCoin and a dozen other merchant services) work just fine now. 
When's the last time anyone was defrauded using one of those services? What's the difference between using one of them and using a LN provider?
As for points 5 &amp; 6... my opinions are less than popular, but they are just opinions. Those points, and my opinions on those points, aren't technical implementation details. Who really cares if 1,500 unsupervised nodes suddenly go offline? If it becomes that big of an issue 1,500 more will pop up. I also think there's an argument to be made that as SegWit has never seen the light of day on a live network the size and scale of Bitcoin that it's quite possible there are errors yet undiscovered. How long did the buffer overrun error exist before it was abused and fixed via a hard fork?  One must then also concede that emergent consensus is nearly as equally untested, however the community effected by that change is much smaller than that effected by SegWit, as individual nodes can simply turn off block size validation as a rule of consensus and any incompatibility is solved.

1a) I disagree that block size is as critical as the emission limit, but you're welcome to your opinion.
2) If it requires the Core client to hard fork it is by definition a matter of consensus. Initially it was simply a choice of whoever was producing blocks and clients would accept whatever was constructed with valid TXs. We can also discuss how it was originally 32MB as well if you'd like. 
3) I'm not going to recap information others have already explained in great technical detail. Let Google be thy guide.

Interesting point, however I don't believe that's the perception that regulators will have based on previous opinions made both in public and private.

If we are going to speak for Real Life Users (TM) then let's be real. Real life users already don't care how money works. They only care that it does work. That being said, they just want their transactions to show up when they send them. They don't want to worry about them disappearing from the mempool and never getting confirmed. They would rather not pay fees that approach or exceed that of wire transfers or PayPal. 
Someone must write the code everyone else uses. Those people need to eat and pay rent and live a life. That means somewhere in all this someone must foot the bill for software development. There no getting around it. The corruption of the BTCF lead to its defunding and its inability to pay developers, which one may argue directly lead to this impasse.

1a) BU's change forever removes the block size debate. It's worth the lines of code for a solution that works in perpetuity and forever removes protocol developers from the issue. That's just my opinion. I'm sure that Core will have incentive to take steps to prevent replay attacks should that become a present danger. Aren't you?
2) Satoshi also had the block size in the P2P layer. Who moved it to the consensus layer and why?
3) Malleability solutions were offered by other Core devs within 3 days of the MtGox attack and were rejected. Creating two UTXO data sets...creating another problem trying to solve a problem...isn't good development.
It's a problem for those who wish to adhere to Core clients. It's not a problem for Bitcoin and not BU. Your argument regarding Ethereum is invalid. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:54:01
Your characterization is completely unfounded. What "fringe actors?"  Bitcoin miners can only attack SHA-256 chains. What you see is the market moving away from SHA-256, even in light of greater infrastructure support, precisely to get away from the threat of being harmed by Bitcoin miners. 
If you want to call 140Ph/s a "fringe actor," which was been evidenced in some destructive events, I wonder if your understanding of the exact scale of the problem may require a bit of adjustment.

People complain all the time about not having a vote in the ecosystem unless they are a miner. The ETF is a sure fire way to influence Bitcoin in profound ways that are difficult to understate and the only thing you have to do is ... nothing. Absolutely nothing. The more Bitcoin you buy and hold is less Bitcoin available for the ETF to vacuum up.
The ETF is *validation* for Bitcoin which the broader markets require for major investment. 
If you want Bitcoin to become a global reserve currency - or a long term store of value - this is the first step. 
With all of the divisiveness of the block size debate, the approval of the ETF represents a winning situation for everyone involved in the ecosystem, regardless your hopes and dreams for how this new economy takes shape.

1a) If we are going to quote Satoshi then he said that not everyone will run full nodes. Old argument.

3) You want your argument addressed in the way you framed it when your framing is inaccurate. That's not my problem. DYOR. Try John Blocke's medium blog.

Trying to guess what someone wants is pure folly when there is data in your face. The only result of such thinking is to ignore reality until there's no choice but deal with it. 
Instead of trying to attribute motive without any sort of factual basis, why not look at what the blockchain data indicates and draw conclusions from that?
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:12:25
I've been saying the same sorts of things. Both teams fail in completely different ways and both would rather play word games and social media politics instead of having open and honest technical discussions.
The sentiment that this is the third attempt at a scaling solution from what has now evolved as a status quo is dismissed as "attacks" when such rhetoric only reveals more about the zealotry of the individual than it does about the issue itself. 
If this fails there will be more, however what I see as more likely is the BU implementation being driven by miners from a development standpoint, whereas one may argue Core is developed from an economic standpoint. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:55:23

Software development is the least important factor in the entire ecosystem. That the protocol developers have been elevated to such a status is a function of cargo cultish money worship. If the Core devs didn't exist protocol development would most likely be decentralized among miners and be equally as robust and secure as it is now. 
It's also important to keep in mind that the BTC Foundation was corrupt to its core (pun intended) while its existence was ostensibly to provide for protocol development. Now that process is privatized by the same people and for some reason there's this expectation that corruption isn't equally endemic now as it was then.

May we be honest?
The constant trolling makes for a poor business decision for a startup in this space not to support some version of SegWit + HF.
That being said, I have stuff I can't do until this matter is resolved. A ledger which is immutable and incoercible due to the process of mining is very attractive as a permanent proof of purchase, which unlocks thousands of commercial use cases and that requires no additional technology beyond changing one constant in the Bitcoin source code.
I know the issue seems really complex if you try to follow it every day, but if you are busier trying to build things to add value and then you take a look at what people are trying to do and the first reaction most CEOs have that I've spoken with is "WTF?"

That's the first paragraph outlining risks between the chains. 
The risk to the BIP148 chain that is ignored is that it will have less POW while the main chain chugs right along, which isn't an incentive for economic support. 
Edit to add: until a difficulty retarget businesses on the BIP148 chain will lurch to a halt

Let's be accurate: market manipulation is responsible for the increase.
Anyone who thinks his is legitimate is a fool, and anyone buying LTC at these prices is a bigger fool.
There is no demand for LTC. It is not spendable at thousands of retailers like Bitcoin. It is not programmable money like Ethereum. Blocks are not full. It can be easily hard forked.

Gambling has always been a part of crypto. The markets themselves are one huge poker game. 
You're fine. Even the much touted use cases with funding, like kill switches in cars for nonpayment of loans, find legitimate friction to implementation. The U.K. recently ruled such kill switches were unsafe and immoral. 
Nobody wants a Skynet-Terminator-Robots-Run-Everything future but the people pushing their favorite pet smart contract project. 
Blockchains are good. They contain basic ownership assignment smart contracts like Bitcoin. They work thousands of times a day. 
Anything of any greater complexity has proved to be risky, expensive, and/or impractical. 
Will we get there some day? Maybe. In like 100 years. If anyone cares that long. 
I think the world is going to get better because these things exist, not because anyone actually uses them. Sometimes the threat is as good as the delivery.

Ummm... if BIP148 has a minority hash rate it will still have to mine blocks at the current difficulty.
Proof of work may be submitted to both chains at the same time until the POW required for either chain differs. 
Should only 30% hashrate adopt the BIP148 chain it will take almost 3 days to mine 100 blocks, not 16 hours.

Bitcoin is Turing complete as it has two stacks.
nChain has a war chest of cash without deliverables and may now de-distort the narrative more towards objective reality unfettered by the conflicts of interest created by Digital Currency Group. 
I love how this works. No SegWit. No DCG. No more manipulation by VCs for profit and in the end the original mechanics Satoshi set forth to prevent Protocol corruption are proved worthy.

Your linked post actually concedes the point that such things are indeed possible with two stacks but would need to be built.

If you're familiar with the language Forth developed in the 70s, it was a two stack language. Yes, it's inefficient but a data stack does serve purpose in stateful systems. "Bloat" is a Core trigger word and nobody else cares and if it's mental masturbation then to say such a thing is a gratuitous assertion anyway. You can't have it both ways.

Except LTC requires a completely different investment from BTC, so the comparison has different economic considerations depending on the intended target.

The problem is that cost of the fee is disconnected from the value being transmitted and that's a feature not a bug.
Cost. Price. Value. Three words with three different meanings and if you use them incorrectly you look stupid. 
The price of a Bitcoin transaction is 200 sats per byte. The cost is what fraction of the US dollar that 200 sats represents. The value is purely subjective based on the perceived importance of that transaction entering a block in a specific time frame. 
There was a time when Bitcoin was "fire and forget" because there was no transaction expiration. The 72 hour limit creates a situation where the value is *extorted* from the user with the *threat* of their transaction expiring and never entering a block. 
Now comes the fee market...which only exists because of a contrived environment of fear. 
Want to change the entire dynamic of the debate?
End the unnecessary expiration of transactions in the mempool and watch what happens. 
Edit: I had to edit my post because I realized I misused the terms myself. That's how tricky it is.

You don't understand how all this works. 
Let's say I got 10BTC from someone for doing work, and they send that 10BTC to me in 1,000 transactions instead of one transaction.

Well by your own words the "only" thing that changes is the removal of mining from the consensus model. Since it's clearly defined in the white paper the role proof of work plays in the consensus model I don't think characterizing the change as "radical" is out of line.

Altcoins are Bitcoin's viral network effect, as well as natural inflation that any monetary system requires.
That being said, we've seen countless developments and strategies and schemes for this tech in alts that have been largely ignored by Core developers. In private conversations alt devs are generally outraged at the half truths and misconceptions being offered. 
What is the difference between a Lightning Network and master nodes from the consumer or the node hosting it in the final analysis? Very little.
And yet when compatible, battle tested code is in the wild there's this hubris of thinking that whatever untested nonsense is offered by Core devs should be swallowed because they are the "experts."
Honest developers will tell you there are no experts and any idea that works is better than one that hasn't been tested.

It isn't wise to count on economic support until the retarget. You're asking businesses to risk potential loss due to double spend while the short chain slogs towards a retarget. 
Until the retarget there's a distinct and unmentioned danger of a total reorg of the UASF chain from selfish mining. 
Your theory is flawed. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:08:14
That's sorta the thing. One must think adversarially, which is because nobody can dictate how anyone uses the network. That's when we get into things like "fungibility" which isn't something you want to mess around with lightly. 
When one starts to dictate in code or regulation who may or may not use Bitcoin beyond its original vision then there is simply no denying that one is attempting to manipulate the protocol for their own desires and quite frankly your desires are no more valid than mine or anyone else that wants to use the network. 
That's what real consensus looks like.

Bitcoin commentary, especially that attempting to craft a historical narrative, usually depends on the story one wants to tell. 
Mircea Popescu started his own client. The Conformant team did their own client. THEN you get things like BitcoinXT and Classic. 
When a startup goes IPO usually the leadership changes because the folks who built a company are rarely the folks to operate it at a new level. That's really what we are seeing in these growing pains. 
There's no reason anyone would ever step aside gracefully when they are no longer good for Bitcoin. They must be coded out.

It's called Bitcoin. You can tell because it's the closest thing to what Satoshi launched. 
I don't know how we got to the point where so many people think it's a good idea to diverge from that path because of one person when the solution is simply to invest money and build and use miners. 
That's what Bitcoin was designed to do. I don't think it's a failing of Satoshi's vision that China can produce cheap and efficient electronics. I don't think it's Jihan's fault for having a vision and the skill to execute it. 
I don't think it's good for there to be a trend in Bitcoin to punish people or degrade them for being successful at playing by the same rules everyone else played by.
