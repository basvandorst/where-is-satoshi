What is the problem with you? Do you understand English so badly? Тогда мы можем пообщаться на вашем родном языке - русском.
Answer my specific question.
1. You got a real selfie and a passport photo on July 7th.
2. You told me for 2 weeks that you are conducting some kind of investigation.
3. July 19, I told you that I know that you are from Russia and I know all the information about you.
4. And on the same day you started talking about video verification.
Tell people what investigation you conducted from July 7 to 19? In    Russia, you can not do anything with JPG  pictures, because for    Russia you are criminals yourself. The only thing  that was available   to  you is blockchain. But it perfectly shows that I  own funds for 5    years. To understand this need not more than 5 minutes.  So I repeat. By    what right did you hold my funds for 2 weeks (July 7 to 19)?

I will say that your brain work badly, so you can not understand the essence of that post/comment.

# Brigading  is prohibited on Reddit. Your gang has no right to manipulate votes and  send false complaints. I warn you. When the administration gets to my  question, you can get sanctions for it. Just do not ignore the question,  but give a honest detailed answer.
Explain please why you fled your office a week ago? (as soon as Russian sites wrote about your illegal activities)
**St. Petersburg, Ligovsky prospect, 50, building 13, office 28**
Why, when someone calls **+7 812 646-96-32**, **Konstantin Brumm** refuses to give a new address?

You  call yourself a legitimate business. Why do you run away from  your  office and keep the new address a secret? What are you afraid of?  After  all, you have everything under the law and Russian police will  protect  you. So what is the problem?

REPLY TO MY QUESTION. USERS SHOULD KNOW THIS
What could you investigate for 2 weeks?
In    Russia, you can not do anything with JPG  pictures, because for   Russia you are criminals yourself. The only thing  that was available  to  you is blockchain. But it perfectly shows that I  own funds for 5   years. To understand this need not more than 5 minutes.  So I repeat. By   what right did you hold my funds for 2 weeks?(6 July -  19 July)
