There is still so little info about it right now, I don't think any of this has been made public yet.  I don't think we will know more until January.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:23:33
I don't think anyone knows the answer to this other than Kim Dotcom right now.  More details are coming in January.

I admit that I hold bitcoin, so take my opinion for what it's worth.  Personally I think BTC will at least test it's high again, sometime in the next month or two.  I think it will struggle to break that high but will eventually do so, sending BTC to the $25K range before the end of March.  Just my opinion, and please remember I do have Bitcoin in my portfolio.

I would say no.  For retirement, you want safe investments which don't fluctuate a lot but go up in the long run.  Stocks and Bonds.

Umm, why would citibank say this? Source or it didn't happen.

While it is a bubble, the bubble may not pop until it hits $200K.  You never know.

Markets don't just go up without a correction.  After every large BTC spike we've seen about 30% corrections.  There is a lot of support at $14K, and that also represent about a 30% fall.  I would be led to believe we will see it bounce off of $14K.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:48:14
There is strong resistance at $14K and $11K.  My guess is it bounces back at around $14K but that's just my opinon.

Another attempt by BCH to push down the price of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:18:14
No, Roger Ver, Insider Trading is a very serious crime.   
Ver just knows that he's a millionaire because of insider trading.

The price is different on different exchanges, but typically is pretty close.  Any large differences end up being fixed via arbitrage.

I too have heard that Gates was not a fan of the internet.  He never thought it would survive because he simply did not understand it.

Mark my words.... This scammer will be locked up.  It wouldn't surprise me if he is already under federal investigation.

Twitter should implement a micropayments solution using Bitcoin, "Like" and then "Bitcoin Like" :\)

This is true.  I sold all I could that I had in the exchangers.  Too bad I didn't put more in the exchangers before it split.

Gambling is based on odds that are never in your favor.
Bitcoin is based on Supply and Demand in which odds are never against your or for you.  They are 50/50.

$8K is a solid floor.

The real question is if governments around the world begin accepting it as a legitimate currency similarly to what Japan has done.  
Each country that does could send BTC up $500-$2000.  What would send BTC up a crazy amount is if a country were to officially adopt BTC as their currency.  Even if a small country were to do this, BTC would jump to $50K easily.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:15:34
Awesome.  Why doesn't America embrace Bitcoin as much as Asia?
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:10:54
This is really huge news for the demand for Bitcoin.  I wish we'd see more US based companies do the same.

Good buy.  I have a lot that i bought back when it was $90 that I'm still holding.

This is so true.  what BCC will exist I doubt it will ever be worth more then 10% of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:20:10
If everyone were required to read this, Bitcoin would be the mainstream currency and worth $500K per coin.

A little more details:  
A Greek police official said U.S. authorities accused the man and unnamed associates of running a website that carried out bitcoin conversions for proceeds from online hacking ransom, drug running, identity theft and tax violations. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because the information was not yet officially disclosed.

The SEC stuff is centered around Tokens.  If anything it will be good for Bitcoin.  It may effect Ethereum since most of the tokens are bought with Eth.

Once Segwit2X is confirmed 100% I think we will see Bitcoin break the $3K barrier and before bouncing between $3K and $3250 for some time.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:18:48
Off to $5000 soon!

I think this spells doom for ICOs but in the end will benefit Bitcoin.

WOW!  Just Wow! This man will be serving a hefty prison sentence!
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:11:57
It pretty much takes a book to explain this!
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:11:43
Basically people are raising money (hundreds of millions) by releasing a white paper with plans on what they will do.  Most of the plans these Tokens have are already capable of being done by Eth or BTC.  It's useless and the business models will fail.  Most of the CEOs know this.  It's a scam!

This is definitely a good problem to have

Why can't this happen in the US?  That is what will really make the prices soar!

What effect do you think the formation of national cryptocurrencies have on Bitcoin?  Do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the value and use of Bitcoin?

Ethereum will always depend on Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin fails, Ethereum will as well.  The majority of people buying Ethereum do so with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will always be

I've noticed this too.  CNN hasn't been reporting on what could be the largest investment gain in some time.  I wonder why...
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:35:51
I almost invested $2750 for a 1/1000 ownership in Coinbase when they launched.  Instead I got too lazy and didn't want to filed the paper work.  Now that share would be worth $1 million based on the $1 billion valuation!

My guess is he wants to wait til the aftermath of Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:17:08
The crytos currency pump and dump.  The SEC doesn't regulate cryptos so is it even illegal?
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:54:58
The darknet may have driven Bitcoin initially but what has carried it is the acceptance by legitimate companies and governments.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:17:20
I'm a little confused because I don't see "cryptocurrency" mentioned anywhere in this bill.  Can you point out the text that mentions crypto or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:13:53
I doubt that 70% of them even understand what Segwit is.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:21:34
This isn't surprising.  I'm waiting to see Bitcoin trending on Facebook and Twitter.

I'm sure there are a lot of people out there like this man.  I know of a few who paid $150 and now see it valued at $2500+
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:55:45
Huge news.  This has the potential to really make Bitcoin bounce.  If they begin accepting it, so too will other investment platforms.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:19:07
Wow, great prediction.  I think we will ultimately see Bitcoin hit around $20K over the next 5 years or it will completely fall to $0.  It's a risk I'm willing to take!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:00:13
It could cross 100K easily if governments of countries declare it their official currency.  Likely?  No, but possible, yes?  If a country like Russia or the UK or America said they want Bitcoin as their main currency the price would probably come close to $500K.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:25:07
I don't think this is true.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:27:31
If countries adopt it as their official currency, then yes it could go to $1 million.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:19:05
Japan is leading the charge in Bitcoin value.  All it takes is one country to establish the crypto as a legitimate currency.  Japan is doing just that.  Now if other countries jump aboard we could see Bitcoin hit $10K
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:11:44
Must be a signal that it is about to shoot up to $100,000!

The questions is..... "Can we break the $2500 mark?"  If we do, this will soar.
