first pizzeria to only accept payments in bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:55:23
apparently they can do this somehow:

nope a bitcointip is not a transaction on the blockchain. It is off blockchain from on "tipwallet" to the other. So there is no transaction fee. There will be only a fee if the user withdraws the tips to this bitcoin wallet, but he can accumulate tips before doing so or just tip his btc to another user

No i can't as I am not the developer. It's in BETA testing and not open source atm afaik. We will see once it will be finished. Nevertheless I am intrigued by the concept

I'm currently trying out mining at middlecoin (7970  Now thinking about buying a small ASIC miner (will not point it at ghash.io obviously). What ASIC miner could I realistically get for couple hundred mBTC?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:07:12
at the moment i guess it would be possible because Darksend isn't implemented yet!
But I hope we will get it soon!

no mining with the pi definitly not. But you can connect a usb hub to your pi and run some USB ASIC miners.
Here's a tutorial: 
But as I said do NOT expect to make a profit mining with those!

Then nothing - I didn't say that its super effective

they will buy more hardware if more people buy GHs...

"From memory, is it easy to recall what a μBTC (microbitcoin) is? Or that a mBTC (millibitcoin) is 0.001 of a bitcoin? Do we really need a bunch of different hard-to-remember names and acronyms?"
Seriously? Is it hard for you to remember that a millimeter is a 1/1000th of a meter or 0.001 meter? How is the metric system hard to remember?

They can ignore the protest all they want. I don't think the protest is primarly to get Apples attention but to get the attention of other consumers. And they can then protest with their wallet

Buying is the only reasonable option. You could get some usb miners and a raspberry pi if you have fun playing around with it but be aware that it's almost certain that you won't get your investment back. Forget the faucets.
So yeah if you want to invest in bitcoin buy some.

i think the differences is that with darkcoin the coinjoin is implemented in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:44:02
It's one of the few altcoins that isn't just a clone. I never said that it will surpass bitcoin in usage. But nevertheless I think it's doing important work for privacy in the cryptocommunity
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:26:00
But the coinjoin is not decentralised afaik. Don't get me wrong I think darkwallet is great but I think Darkcoin also is doing great work for securing crypto user privacy

the bitcoin network is getting more and more centralized. Won't that happen to Bitcloud as well so we will again have large companies offering the bandwidth?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:13:19
no progress the time just increases.
I'm running 0.93.1 as you can see in the screenshot
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:23:47
will try, thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:14:44
I think it's properly configured :)
Armory starts Bitcoin core on its own. If I start it manually and then start Armory it says "Please close Bitcoin QT"
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:23:37
No unfortunately not...
I followed Zyklon87 suggestion and disabled the checkbox "Let Armory run Bitcoin core in the background" and started it manually.
It synced fine but now my watch-only wallet shows 0 BTC Balance.
But if i check my addresses on blockchain.info their balance sure as hell isn't 0.
Really strange...
I'm running 0.10 and I'm using custom directories. Don't have listen or addnode in my conf

When I'm not hungry I hardly buy anything and then I have to go shopping again as soon as I get hungry^^

just send an email to an equivalent german site  (pizza.de) notifying them of this and asking them if they will accept bitcoin anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:42:05
As far as i know they only accept cash, paypal, visa, mastercard and giropay
EDIT: Just did some research and apparantly lieferservice.de is already accepting bitcoins. Damn I could've mentioned that in my mail to pizza.de
