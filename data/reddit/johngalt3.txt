The reason schemes like this are rarely not a scam is because he could easily get capital somewhere else at a better interest rate. There has to be some loan shark that charges less than a 200%+ APR or whatever he is giving out.

Yes this is exactly what I mean. If everyone would just send their money to wikileaks directly wikileaks would gain 9% more money on average.
If you play this game you are just siphoning money to you. Every bet can be seen as a ~91% donation to wikileaks and a 9% donation to you.

As long as they don't start to take the other side of bets in secret to encourage action then I guess you are right.
@_date: 2012-09-15 06:52:02
I think I'm not mistaken at all. Let's say a user makes 8 bets for 1 btc (8 btc total) and every number is hit once:
Discounting the jackpot: 
Total payout to wikileaks = 3+2.1+1.5+0.5+0.05+0.001+0.0001+0.00001= 7.15
house takes 8-7.15= 0.85
Of this 0.85 0.085 is added to the jackpot?
So basically if someone were to donate directly to wikileaks they would get around 9% more instead of you getting it. Now tell me where I am wrong exactly.

Someone just sent him 0.005.
It's also already tagged as scam. Is there any way to automatically tag addresses on blockchain.info?

Completely disregarding the component of technological advancement in economical growth.

Problem is there are only about 10 million bitcoins in existence at the moment :).
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:35:55
Nobody said anything about them accepting bitcoin, it's just some nice exposure on a very high traffic site.
@_date: 2013-01-30 23:56:52
Still do to the nature of ASICs if they can make one fully functional unit they should also be able to make many more. (Unless they are looking at huge fault rates of course.)

Have you been living under a rock?
The monday surge has been going on for a few weeks now. Fundamentally, who knows.
@_date: 2013-02-11 14:57:07
Yes bu their revenue comes form people gambling and a bitcoin at $10 is easier gambled away than a bitcoin at $25.
On the other hand a lot of gamblers already hold many bitcoins and they might gmable more once their bitcoins are worth more because they feel richer.
So either way I think it can definitely have an influence.

show the two lines in the same graph to see if there is correlation.

About 30% harder than before the adjustment.

They probably got a batch of older generation FPGA's at a special price. ASICs are a whole different ballgame.

I still don't think it's smart to leave your money in a controversial gambling site for long periods of time to maybe get a small percentage of profit.
@_date: 2013-03-31 08:16:29
If they don't accept do you go back to the end of the queue?
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:18:57
Without reading the article, no, because they can keep it all in safe cold storage.
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:20:43
Thanks, that clears things up.

Blow to the arm is a stupid translation of "slag om de arm" which basically means they're not so sure about it yet.

He means was it an inside job or not?

He could just use bcrypt with a huge cost parameter, which is a much better solution than yours.

This is not a coincidence at all, it is the very definition of the term, like Starensen mentioned.

You say "thus", but this does not follow from the above. Tell me why that value cannot exceed some arbitrary amount of power expended. If  the market values bitcoin at $xxx it values it at that price regardless of  energy expended to mine them.

@_date: 2013-04-16 02:39:15


This is not true at all. 3 litecoin block confirmations is MUCH more solid than an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction, since you need very significant hashing power to redo 3 litecoin blocks while you can potentially double spend an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction with some luck and no hashing power.

Nope, You had to actively click a link for the exploit to work. Also the email trade validation would have stopped it.

Still the way unicode works if you include the whole character set the amount of entropy can be as high as a 12 character ASCII password. So that's not really fair.
@_date: 2013-02-04 09:29:48
That's going to take a while to eat through.

So did I, just seems risky to see if it will go down to 700 again.

Personally I'm fine with you trying to make a buck, but I hate the gambling spam on all the time.

They are just taking educated guesses though.
