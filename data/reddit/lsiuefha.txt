Isn't it a little silly not to dare calling it "Bitcoin Cash"?
I'd like to think we are grown ups.

When BitcoinXT came about, people were banned from this forum for even talking about it. How come we are allowed to talk about Bitcoin Cash nowadays? 
Will I be banned for this comment?

Know this can change fast - if you made decisions based on data like this you end up in a similar situation as AOL or Nokia. Seeing into the past does not mean winning the future.

I know things which are not "too the mooon" comments get downvoted here - but please humour me because it's a honest question. 
While there will only be 21 million bitcoins - there is an infinite amount of currencies that can be made. What other than first-mover-advantage would mean bitcoin stays dominant in value? I fail to understand how Bitcoin can be &gt;50% of crypto currency worth in 20 years or so.

I'm reading both this and Thank you for sharing your thoughts. My question is to the r/Bitcoin community - can a post like this advocating for raising blocksize be posted here or will it be removed? Will that poster be banned by mods, rather than downvoted? 
Both changes discussed (segwit &amp; bigger blocks) require change in code, which is why I'm considering my support for either.

I'm staying in Germany at the moment - and am a lazy bum ordering food now and then. Sadly choosing to pay cash, because that gives me the security of only paying when food is delivered. It has happened that I missed the delivery guy and had already paid (they didn't ring the bell twice and left), leaving me 15 euro out. 
Would have loved to pay in Bitcoin at the door. 
My 2 satoshi...
