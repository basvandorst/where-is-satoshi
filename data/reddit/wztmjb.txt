Yeah, right, I'm going to jump right on refuting unsubstantiated bullshit.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:59:19
In my case, it was understanding the subtleties of the problem, after thinking it was just "replace 1 with 2", as it's portrayed by the other camp. In addition to inherent scaling issues with broadcast networks and technical issues specific to Bitcoin (quadratic complexity for signature verification), increasing the block size now would make it seem like it's a valid scaling solution. There's no reasonable block size that would support a significant portion of the population using Bitcoin, so increasing it now would just put us back into the same position very quickly. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:58:46
Yeah, I thought so too, but at this point I don't think the blocksize is limiting the adoption. The "pay-for-coffee" use-case isn't very realistic even with empty blocks due to confirmation times.

@_date: 2016-06-21 18:53:51
Personally, I view Lightning as an absolutely genius evolution of Bitcoin. Even taking confirmations out of the picture, the main network was never going to scale to the level where anyone can pay for coffee using it. It's just not possible when every single transaction is public. It's much better to truly scale it now, than scramble years into the future when blocks are huge and there's no more increasing them.
@_date: 2016-06-25 00:54:08
It's no longer a discussion though, it's just one side repeating the same statement over and over, while refusing to listen to arguments. Once it gets to this point it's just a distraction to the rest of the community, so letting it go on here is of no benefit for anyone.

So the people capable of implementing this don't consider it worth doing. Think about why that might be the case.
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:43:12
I assume in part it is people reaching for easily identifiable reasons against SegWit, as their scaling preference is a blocksize increase (I understand that Segwit is an effective increase to ~2MB)
Yup, I think this is exactly what's happening. The issue is that people technical enough to have a preference worth listening to don't share this view, and convincing someone without sufficient background is proving impossible. It's easy to understand changing a single constant, it's much more difficult to understand why a major refactoring is needed, and why it has to be done all at once in a decentralized system.
Though given 2 choices for the future that can be performed in either order ( I understand the ordering is controversial though I am not convinced )




There is no proposal for implementing this, though, that has the needed level of technical consensus. If it existed, it would be a no-brainer, but it turns out that there's much more to it than just changing the constant. On top of that, the teams proposing or implementing these behave in an unprofessional manner, which results in the frustrated divide we have now. I'm somewhat subjective here, but there's a world of difference between how Core development is done, versus the other variants.
In the light of this where should we direct our energies? (this is not meant to come accross as ungrateful from an armchair coder who hasn't picked up Stroustrup for many years, and has only just started a full node)
Trust the technical community, and rally behind SegWit. There is no alternative on the table that has been reviewed and tested so much, and it enables future capacity increases well beyond simple blocksize changes, just due to linear signature verification alone, not to mention the L2 possibilities.
As an aside do you know (please be gentle or/and direct me to relevant work preferably accessible to said armchair coder)
If we transition to Schnorr signatures for transactions in SegWit (if this is even possible) would it be possible to aggregate all the input sigs into one signature? *(edit clarification i mean all input sigs form 1 transaction with many inputs not all sigs from every transaction in block)*
I'm not a cryptographer, and haven't looked into this in detail, but as I understand it Schnorr does exactly this - all input signatures in a transaction are replaced by a single one. I don't have any links for you, sorry, and I should read up on this myself. I believe SegWit makes it possible to add Schnorr and other things like Confidential Transactions without going through a soft-fork signaling phase, but I'm not totally sure about this.
and by extension if we could hard fork to a new transaction type that used Schnorr would we be able to aggregate many input sigs into 1 sig thereby gaining SegWits UTXO benefits.
We could, sure, with a hard fork we can do anything. But the risks are significant for a crypto currency with as much use as Bitcoin. There's a long list of possible changes we'd want in a hard fork (Google "Bitcoin hardfork wish list" or something like that). If we're going to disrupt the network and cause people to lose money, we better get a lot out of it. 
Thanks for the discussion and your work on Bitcoin.
I don't actually work on Bitcoin, I'm just a mouth-foaming enthusiast :)

Here's what you said about P2SH:


Here's what you said about a hypothetical softfork: 




This implies that the witness separation in SegWit has a material difference in an "undo" scenario compared to undoing P2SH. To demonstrate that this is true, you first have to demonstrate what it would take to undo P2SH. If you were to actually do that, you'd see that there's virtually no difference between P2SH and SegWit in this case.
"Undoing" either is an equally nonsensical proposition without a specific stated purpose. If a bug is found, it will be fixed. There's no "undo" once outputs are in the blockchain, otherwise you're taking money away from users.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:44:01

Usually change goes to a brand new address, which the wallet creates, for privacy reasons. But in some cases, like when spending from an offline paper wallet, for instance, it'll go back to the same address. A paper wallet has a single private key on it, so change has to go back to the same address. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:28:34




Specifics, please. How, specifically, would you "undo" P2SH?

Sad, isn't it. It's down to a few people, they're always downvoted, collapsed on the bottom. Trying to participate there is very draining. It's gotten worse recently, too, it wasn't that bad before. 




Exactly. Something so fundamental needs to touch lots of places in the code. In a normal, non-consensus system, you can do this kind of thing in stages. In a decentralized system, the only reasonable way to do it is in one shot, to activate all at once. There are some clever hacks for backwards compatibility, but any soft-fork is going to have that. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:43:49
My apologies for the tone, usually these threads with SegWit detractors end as soon as I ask for details, and it's frustrating and draining.
I don't take concerns about undoing SegWit seriously, because no other soft fork had these concerns brought up. Now all of a sudden everyone is concerned about undoing SegWit, due to the supposed complexity - but there isn't any **additional** complexity, really. Let's say we want to undo P2SH, without confiscating anyone's money. What does that even mean? You have to preserve the ability to spend P2SH outputs. So do you remove the ability to create P2SH addresses, so no more can be created? Fine, but existing ones still need to be spent. So maybe you keep existing logic, or add new opcodes, or add a new transaction type to spend them. It's a hard fork, by definition, so we can do anything we want, pretty much.
The approach for SegWit is identical. Whatever way you're adding to spend SegWit outputs is simply going to handle witness data in whatever way you want in the hard fork. Want to keep it with the transaction, but skip it while calculating TXIDs? Go for it. Want to stick it into a new section of the block, instead of separately? Sure, it's a hard fork, you can do whatever you want. This is a trivial engineering decision compared to everything else in this hypothetical "rollback".
The problem I have with all this is that nobody defines what they mean by "undoing" SegWit. It's a nonsensical statement once it activates and outputs exist in the blockchain. If there's a detailed description of the rollback is supposed to accomplish, I'm all ears. I haven't seen one yet.

@_date: 2017-01-13 23:31:20
BU's approach is a non-starter by design. It makes the network irrelevant, and gives miners the power to select the block size. What's worse is that BU's developers and supporters dismiss these concerns, so it's impossible to even have a discussion.

Currencies nobody cares about have hard forked, true. That has no impact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:20:30




Where does the witness data go? What do we do with the data in the original block? How do you reflect the difference on costs on the network between witness and non-witness data? 




"drastically reduce the fee per block"? How? More transactions per block means more fees, so clearly mining SegWit blocks is more beneficial in that case.

In this scenario, B can broadcast the transaction they have, but it will just settle the balances, effectively closing the channel. The secret values are used to counteract an attempt to broadcast the previous state, so the two parties won't roll the state forward until the previous secrets are known.

The smart people in there are almost always downvoted and spend their time arguing with the rest of the sub. I can't think of anyone we might want "back" who doesn't fit this description. Who are you thinking of specifically? 
I do agree with you about being scared of complexity, however that doesn't really bode well for that place. SegWit isn't complex to anyone who actually understands it, and expecting to be listened to just because one has an opinion is a ridiculous position. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:03:24
For B to reclaim the funds in this scenario, he needs a secret value that only A knows, in addition to the signed transaction. B gets this value from A after the transaction is signed by B.

Endorsements from a bunch of diverse engineers working in Bitcoin space do say something about the qualify of potential changes to Bitcoin, of course.

I have no idea who you are, or why your opinion is worth anything. I've read plenty of discussions about FT, none of them have any technical arguments, just technobabble which makes no sense to a technical person.

No, any block produced by that miner will still be accepted by the network. Specifically in case of SegWit, the miner will miss out on SegWit transactions, so they'll make less money than they would had they upgraded. But they'll still earn whatever is in their mined blocks.

Even without getting into the details, that's 2 people out of like a 100. Climate change deniers have similar ratios. 




Quadratic signature verification problem is one obvious technical problem. A more in-depth solution would address the UTXO growth incentives, and use an adaptive block size instead of simply changing the constant. Bitcoin is incredibly inefficient by design, the only reason it still exists as a decentralized network is the block size limit. Hard fork risks are real too, and can't just be dismissed. 


Zander's manufactured drama with enum values in XThin alone has shown that he can't be taken seriously. He constantly makes a fool of himself in technical threads, and stops responding. For instance, read the quoted part at the very top of  . It's technical gibberish, and nullc explains why. There were plenty of other cases like this, showing staggering amount of ignorance for someone claiming to have the expertise for  Bitcoin development. 
BU's stunts with blog-posts about Core bugs instead of bug reports (the bug didn't even turn out to be real), childish BLOCKSTREAM_CORE constants in the code, dismissiveness of "emergent blocksize" criticism are unprofessional. Then there's their "hardfork Segwit" proposal, which is binary-incompatible with actual SegWit, for no apparent (or explained) reason. 
In general, competent professionals in this field approach their proposals with the attitude of "here's my proposal, tell me what's wrong with it". Any other approach is a red flag, same with designs that require the entire market to collaborate (BU's approach). 


Greg is just the voice of Core, he's basically doing all the talking so that others can write code in peace. He doesn't have the social or PR skills to do it "nicely", but after seeing what he has to put up with I can't blame him. 
The real development happens outside of reddit. There's plenty of discussions on IRC, Github and development lists. If you look solely at then of course it looks like it's Greg against the world.


Hard fork means a chain split, which by definition means that some transactions will be on a non-valid chain. Each of those transactions is somebody losing money.

Let's just say that Bitcoin today isn't for the faint of heart :) In the long term though, the longer the network exists, the less likely is the value to disappear. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:25:40
Nah, that's normal for this sub. When price breaks through new highs, it turns into a euphoric memefest until reality sets in :)
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:18:41
The narrative is that the economic majority wants big blocks, so if that were true, they'd all immediately migrate to the chain with them. Considering the "two bitcoins are better than one" statements, which everyone rallies behind, forking would be a logical next step. And yet... 
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:03:40
Blocks weren't full 1.5 years ago though, that's a more recent phenomenon. The fees from around that time were roughly half of what they are today. Not to mention that SegWit won't make more space available immediately at activation, so it's unclear how long, if at all, it will take for the fees to change.
But the OP wanted to drop "price elasticity" into the conversation, so why let reality stand in the way of that.

This has been the case for a very long time. You can easily make up your own mind by seeing which subreddit runs out of arguments in every single thread. One of them responds with technically accurate facts, supported by links to evidence, with prominent developers pitching in. The other one repeats statements with no supporting evidence other than links to threads on the same subreddit, with lots of childish personal attacks sprinkled in. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:11:33
So two lookups for every transaction hash, and two code paths for every transaction? That doesn't sound simple. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:39:37
1 and 2 are mutually exclusive, which confirms my initial reaction that you're starting with an impossible premise on purpose.
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:16:08


There are plenty of technical reasons it can't, supported by the vast majority of technical community. Bitcoin is a broadcast, flood network which persists everything until the heat death of the Universe (hopefully). It's **very** different from any other technology which came before it. Increasing the limit and hoping that it will work, because "there's no reason it won't" isn't a viable approach. It's basically the equivalent of "hold my beer bro, watch this!". Red flag  for any seasoned professional


With BU, I have no idea how many confirmations to wait for so that I can consider my transaction "committed". The chain can fork at any time, or I may be on the wrong one, or payer and payee can be on two different chains entirely. None of this has been tested, the arguments are dismissed with "we hope it won't happen / miners aren't stupid / you don't get it". Red flag  for any seasoned professional.


Miners don't make controversial decisions because the network of full nodes will reject their blocks, and they will lose money. They're rational, they're not benevolent. With BU, the network will converge on whatever the miners will do. That's the difference. 


What happens to the network and payments on it while these users are "pulling the levers"? Not to mention that very, very few people actually bother to change the defaults, so expecting the network to somehow come to agreement on the exact right settings  to keep it operational is incredibly naive. Red flag  


Core's entire development process, from major changes only in minor releases, to 95% acceptance criteria for softforks is designed to prevent taking control (note that it's the exact opposite from BU). They believe that raising this parameter will endanger the network, the rest of the "market" trusts them and runs their software. If Core were to introduce changes that the "market" disagreed with, it would be treated exactly like Classic and BU were. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:55:22


I don't believe that's true. If it ever does get enough support to actually "activate", Bitcoin will be dead to me (a failed experiment, if you will). 
Bitcoin, like any highly-technical systems, aren't democracies, there's no compromising to make something flawed a reality. You don't expect the public to vote on design choices in the Large Hadron Collider - this isn't any different.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:27:45


Previous soft-forks just required updating the node software. SegWit needs actual changes in miner/pool software.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:00:05

The rally goes against their narrative, as there are no "big blocker" events to tie it to. That sub gets much more active when the price drops. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:50:14
That post is a one-sided, misleading and inaccurate writeup by the original developer. It's been picked apart multiple times, and I explicitly asked for anything different (and coming from somebody else). 
BIP numbers don't mean anything, anyone can get them with a little bit of effort. For SegWit, we have a [long list]( of endorsements from all over the ecosystem. We also have an unbiased [cost analysis]( from the developers themselves, as opposed to single one-side writeup. That's an entirely different level of professionalism. If you're not willing to invest the time to actually figure out the technical details, at least judge the merits of both proposals from that perspective.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:34:33
I don't understand if you're being dense on purpose or just wasting my time. Lightning nodes will have an address, and wallets supporting Lightning will have an interface to open a channel with a node, given a node's address, by funding it with an onchain transaction. Once that's done, you will be able to send payments to addresses of other users on the Lightning network. Those addresses may look like Bitcoin addresses, might look somewhat different, I don't know those details yet. What is unclear here?
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:56:55
Unless I misunderstand what you're saying, there's no "balance" between block size and transaction fees. There will always be more transactions than block space, as long as Bitcoin keeps growing. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 01:37:40
The private key is only needed to sign a transaction, everything else can be done without it. The private key enables you to sign the transaction so that the network accepts it. So only the signing has to be done on an offline computer, and that process just deals with raw data in the transaction. The data itself is generated on an online computer, just without the signature. For Electrum, you can have a watch-only wallet, which shows the balances for your addresses, and can create a payment transaction, you just won't be able to broadcast it. Once you have the transaction, you can save it to a flash drive, take it to the offline computer, sign it there and save it back to the drive. The signed transaction can then be broadcast from the watch-only Electrum, or even pushed via various other means (blockchain.info/pushtx, for example).
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:50:38
Instead of resorting to insults and throwing around big words with no understanding of what they mean, why don't you take a look at actual transaction fees per block. I even provided a link, if you don't know where to look. The fees have at most doubled when blocks filled up, so even if they go back to that level once SegWit activates, the miner revenue will at worst stay the same. There are always more transactions in the mempool that don't make it into blocks at all. Transaction demand is always greater than supply these days, so bigger blocks via SegWit mean more revenue for the miners. 
If you want to compare Bitcoin to Starbucks, you'll find a lot more agreement in the other sub.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:15:27
Production-ready software is indeed expected to be functional from day 1 of production. If BU was only deployed on test networks your point would stand. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:26:09
Of course, a block size increase is still an increase whether it carries a "SegWit" label or not. SegWit, however, has actually been heavily reviewed, tested, follows current engineering practices and allows for much more careful future capacity increases than just raising the block size. It's the difference between developing for worst-case and best-case - this isn't biased, those are two fundamentally different approaches taken by the solutions. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:28:44
The ability to prune data that's only used to validate transaction and currently cannot be pruned is the evidence. Rejecting that with no evidence to the contrary and calling it "hard facts" doesn't exactly position you outside of the set of "simple minded users".

@_date: 2016-12-16 22:59:43
Great, let's assume the Bitcoin network consists of BU nodes, with 85 percent using the default AD setting of 4. A miner with enough hash rate, or a few colluding miners, can now produce a sequence of 4 blocks of arbitrary large size. The network will accept the new chain, kicking the remaining 15 percent off the network entirely (strictly speaking only those with an AD larger than 4, but that's immaterial). The blocks can keep growing until only the largest nodes can keep up, effectively knocking smaller nodes off the network.
I'm not even bringing up what happens to transactions in smaller chains that will be be orphaned when AD setting triggers.

It's not settled, but the price shows that Bitcoin is valuable enough as it is today. Block size debates are mostly about how to make Bitcoin a useful payment system. Right now it works well as a store of value.

Oh, interesting. Why does malleability affect the ability of third-parties to monitor closures? Isn't it just a matter of examining more than transaction IDs? A "deep packet" transaction inspection, if you will. 
E: Ah, I think I get it. You can't pre-sign a transaction for broadcast if the ID can potentially change.

Unbounded schemes, such as this one, are effectively offering expensive, highly replicated storage space without accounting for the costs. I'll happily use such a system to store my backups, but eventually usage will rise to the point where the UTXO can only be served by a datacenter. A system that centralized has no value.

Segwit means more transactions per block, so **more** fees per block.

If Bitcoin is susceptible to politics, it will die. Bitcoin can only exist in a very narrow technical equilibrium, and if populism appeals can change it there's no value to it. This is basically the divide between the two sides - one side gets it, the other one doesn't.

I'm really not interested in arguing with you. Claims made by others are stated as opinions, they're not presented as "facts".

Bitcoin isn't a good **payment system** today. It's a good store of value, though, and work is on the way to make it a good payment system too.
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:04:42
These are both political arguments, there are plenty of currencies already out there affected by politics. The entire point of Bitcoin is to be agnostic to politics. SegWit is already a compromise, anything else requires technical arguments and support from the development community. Pleasing miners was never the point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:30:47

@_date: 2016-12-01 17:13:53
The network may completely flood with 2MB blocks - it's how broadcast networks work. I wasn't even talking about quadratic complexity of signature verification for transactions, that's a much lower-level problem. Sure, it "might" be fine, but hope isn't a strategy here. SegWit is a block increase that the technical community considers safe enough to deploy, it's seen lots of testing and review, and increases capacity in ways which does not endanger the network. No other proposal has been through anywhere near this level of scrutiny. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:51:09

Yes, of course, and I can certainly relate to how you feel. The network today though is a known, working system with value.

It's much easier because it ignores backwards compatibility (pre-signed transactions that haven't been broadcast), and requires everyone (wallets, exchanges, miners, nodes) to upgrade at a coordinated time.

The fee depends on the size of the transaction in bytes, the value has nothing to do with it. The fee also changes based on load - check out  which estimates them :


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 20,340 satoshis (0.15$).

I'll copy my earlier reply:
Bitcoin transactions spend inputs to an output (technically you can have multiple outputs in a transaction). Inputs are outputs from previous transactions, and each input has a specific size in bytes. The more inputs you have in a transaction, the more expensive it will be. So if your wallet has received 20 one dollar transactions, and you're trying to send someone $20 in Bitcoin, you will pay roughly 20 times the fees versus someone who has a wallet which has received a single payment of $20 or more.

Of course you can have your own views or have different opinions about how things should be done. Stating obvious falsehoods repeatedly, however, isn't much of a vision, and having that sort of "debate" is very frustrating. You say "Core does not really want to do hard forks at all" - that's clearly false, there's a hardfork wishlist on the wiki, there are hardfork plans on the Core roadmap. Core doesn't want to hardfork to just change the block size in the most naive way possible. That's where things stand today, and it's a very different statement from the one you made.
Similarly, the 75/25 block weight split for signature data in SegWit has nothing to do with whether it's a soft fork or a hard fork. The purpose of that is to discourage UTXO bloat. The only difference would be where the merkle tree commitment would go, which is literally a difference of a few lines of code. Is this the first time you're hearing this?  
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:07:46
Ah, I thought it upgraded the wallet. I guess you'd have to delete the old wallet.dat to get a deterministic wallet after upgrade.
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:12:23
Well the fees paid when the exchange sent you that transaction would depend on the number of inputs it uses, yes. However, once it's in your wallet, if it was sent to a single address and as long as it's larger than the amount you're trying to spend, you can just pay the median fee. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 01:51:58
Then you can easily provide multiple links to those statements, no?
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:04:48
That's not how LN works. You open one channel, and it will be routed to whatever peer you're sending money to. A channel-per-peer isn't needed. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 02:01:16
I'd love to address a scenario where you're not an idiot, but that's clearly not happening.
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:37:50
It probably needs to sync, but that version is way old. Do update to the latest one (0.13.1), and make a copy of your wallet.dat file first just in case. 
Also, after you update, make a backup of the new wallet.dat file, since your old one won't be useful anymore. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:56:01
The scenario does not exist today, because the network will not accept the blocks. Miners will lose money if they try this. With BU, the network will follow what the miners do.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:19:41
Use JoinMarket, there's no counterparty risk with it.

Electrum supports this. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:47:30
Sure, but Tor is a very different system. Same arguments don't apply to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:52:05
The risks are that the transaction won't confirm or will be double-spent. There's no way to accept them reliably, you may do it for small amounts if you're ok with losing them altogether. Lightning will make instant Bitcoin payments finally work, until then there's really no other way than to wait for a confirmation.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:48:54
Lightning nodes will do the monitoring for a small fee. Nobody is suggesting for wallets to do that.
@_date: 2016-12-05 00:32:02
Sure, it makes sense, if everything else is free and we ignore the technical details. The reality is unfortunately much more complicated than pure economics.

Of course it increases capacity. Why repeat these obvious lies?
@_date: 2016-12-19 22:03:20
Bitcoin transactions spend inputs to an output (technically you can have multiple outputs in a transaction). Inputs are outputs from previous transactions, and each input has a specific size in bytes. The more inputs you have in a transaction, the more expensive it will be. So if your wallet has received 20 one dollar transactions, and you're trying to send someone $20 in Bitcoin, you will pay roughly 20 times the fees versus someone who has a wallet which has received a single payment of $20 or more.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:04:57

Uhm, how about upgrading Core, like the message says?
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:45:16
Because it's very easy to take Bitcoin, change a few lines, and "create" a new cryptocurrency. Then, if you get enough people to buy into it, you can make a nice profit. 
To be fair, some cryptocurrencies are attempting more innovative approaches than simply cloning Bitcoin with tweaks - the vast majority, however, is just that.

The future where Stop and Shop is on the LN has an active LN with lots of users and active channels. They route their payments to Stop and Shop through their LN-supporting wallet, there would be no need to open a channel directly with Stop and Shop.

So far, Bitcoin has been immune to politics. If politics prevent SegWit activation, so be it - I'll take Bitcoin as-is for eternity over one that can be influenced by populist methods. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:14:13
Other systems will have the exact same issues with more load. Bitcoin happened to be useful for small transactions early on due to little usage. That time is gone - there are plenty of ways to buy coffee today, Bitcoin isn't needed for that. There is no other way to store value without counter-party risk. That's what Bitcoin is for.
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:04:10
No, not at all. You're not seeing the implications with BU's behavior, so I really do want to see which one of us has the misconceptions. If you answer the questions we can go from there.
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:00:28
Just one channel. LN will route along a multi-hop path, so you don't need a channel-per-entity you're dealing with.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:00:46
Mining hardware works by taking a small value, and increasing the nonce in hardware and hashing that, repeatedly. Using it to hash unique values one-by-one is going to be much less efficient, spending all the time on USB I/O. 
The nodes will have to do this as well, without mining hardware, even if it did help. Assuming 5 megahashes/second, that's 17.2 seconds, which isn't actually that bad, and 5 megahashes is on a low end, so ignore me - it'll be ok for quite a while :)
Though to be fair, this assumes everything is in RAM, which won't be true for all nodes, especially in the future. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:25:31
I didn't call anything a conspiracy. So we'll add "reading comprehension issues" to "dismissive asshole" for a complete diagnosis.

@_date: 2016-12-15 02:11:04
Of course it's on the blockchain. How it's stored is irrelevant. You're misunderstanding how this works.

Great argument, as usual. Go back to they miss you over there.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:43:05
Sure, you do spend less, but you do spend. I'm not sure what your point is - of course if you're hoarding you're not spending. Historically merchants accepting BTC have reported increases in BTC payments with each price run-up. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:15:47
You have to forgive the tone of some of the responses here, we're very used to childish behavior from the "other side" and sometimes are guilty of it too. Core and their supporters see Bitcoin as an incredibly inefficient, fragile system that's very easy to break with rushed or not fully tested changes. For a broadcast-only network such as Bitcoin, load increases non-linearly with block size - whether it's quadratic, or worse (or better) isn't known. This isn't about "olive branches", or "compromises" - it's about science and technical competency. Stating "beliefs" and "feelings", without any data to back them up isn't going to work. The network today works, there's no certainty that it will keep working with 2MB blocks. Therefore, it stays as is until we know better. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:25:27
Not sure. I've only done this with the desktop version.
@_date: 2016-12-13 01:36:15
Great analogies. Too bad none of them apply to Bitcoin.

That's not what I said at all.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:38:03
Oh did that sub lit up then! 
This year has been surreal, very reminiscent of 2013, but a much calmer, slow-and-steady version. Reddit is very different today too, though unfortunately not in a positive way :(
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:54:26
Where was the testing run? Any links? I'd love to read the results and the test cases used. The link you sent just has some cherry-picked minor issues in Core code, even if I'm to take it at face value and ignore the fact that it's been debunked multiple times. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:06:26


Do you even know who you're talking to here? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:40:52
This is only true for 0.13. Earlier versions required regular backups. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:17:33
Not so much exaggerating but completely making stuff up. Not you personally, but that sub as a whole. There's no evidence for any of this, just circular arguments with links to other Reddit threads, which often say the exact opposite from what is claimed. I'm yet to see someone competent making a solid argument against SegWit, other than the risks listed on Core's page.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:03:27
Ah, finally someone who really understands everything. Enlighten us.
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:00:00
We've been pretty much **telling** them to do it for months, there's no permission required. That would show exactly how much support exists for BU, though, so of course they're not interested.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:37:03
Whether it's possible or not is kinda irrelevant, as it would undermine all the efforts to get SegWit rolled out with overwhelming consensus. If you have to pay people to use something then it's not worth implementing. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:03:46
No, not much interest or understanding why it's needed. That's how I expected it to turn out, to be honest, but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:24:43
No, that's not what it does. It gives miners the power to force the network to accept whatever size blocks they decide to mine.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:32:44
As long as there's growth, demand will always catch up with whatever capacity is available. There's no block size that lets the world use Bitcoin while it stays decentralized. 
Calling BU's approach "market" is disingenuous, what it does is hand control of Bitcoin to miners (there are other problems with BU's approach, but this one is important for this point). Nobody controls Bitcoin now, which is where its value comes from. If that changes, it'll be worthless.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:38:03
Whether I understand it or not is irrelevant, since I don't see that being the case today.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:09:18
A simple solution to the same problem is always better than a complex one for **production** code. Complex solutions do work, sure, but they require orders of magnitude more testing and peer review, neither of which are happening with BU's changes. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:51:56
Because it takes some effort to support it from the miner side. Some pool software isn't even updated to support it yet. It's going to take more time, there's a reason the activation window is a year.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:36:50
Better fee estimation is the reason to switch. Your transactions will confirm faster with a better wallet.
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:08:09
Yes, if the channel is closed remaining funds are returned via an onchain transaction. That transaction won't be instant, but the ones in between will be.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:36:56
Nope. Why don't you read up on LN before arguing about it.
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:29:22
Don't worry, your other posts make it clear you're an idiot too. This was just icing on the cake.
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:25:39
That's all of that sub summarized, basically.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:15:57
Nobody really knows, anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Personally I think it's the reduced supply, both due to halvening and people not willing to sell. Most of the price movement comes from western exchanges, as far as I can see, with very thin order books. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:34:01
You asked why you're being downvoted, I'm telling you it's because you're coming across as a bitter asshole. You can argue with me if you want, that's only adding to the perception - I couldn't care less. 
Facts are statements supported by evidence. None of your posts match that description. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:06:52
You send a payment to Stop &amp; Shop via your open channel, which LN will route to whichever node Stop &amp; Shop is connected to. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:40:10
You should read [this]( I'm not going to do it justice here. I don't recall which part covers it, but it's there. Basically it's uses the same mechanism for a chain of multiple peers. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:52:37
Bitcoin is a **valid** chain with the most proof-of-work. A longest proof-of-work chain does not become **valid** automatically, only in BU's world. This has been pointed out to you multiple times, and this mistake makes the rest of your arguments shit. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 02:12:02
It is getting hashed though. The commitment is in the block. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:54:26
Sure, user anonymity may improve with more users. The network would only get more decentralized with more users if they all ran full nodes, though.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:37:49
Multiple people, one channel per person. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:11:55
Nah, that has nothing to do with it. Most of the market has no idea SegWit even exists. It's reduced supply, with increasing demand. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:20:07
Nope. Bitcoin does not behave like any of those systems.
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:57:34
Lightning is a mesh network made up of nodes. Nodes provide liquidity, meaning Bitcoins for the other side of payment channel opened by a LN user. The nodes can also route LN payments to their neighboring peers, taking a tiny payment for the service. This makes it possible to send a Lightning payment to any user of the network, no matter which node they connect to. 
Users and nodes are separate concepts, you don't need to run a node to use the network. Once you open a channel to a node, a wallet with LN support will allow you to send a payment to anyone on the network - the network will figure out a route. So, in your scenario, if you have an open channel to any node on the LN, and a merchant has an open channel to a node as well, you can send them a payment. So you don't have a channel per entity you're doing business with, you have a channel with the network, which routes payments to anyone else on it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:04:23
The evidence you've provided for this statement is overwhelming. Of course, why didn't I think of that!

ipv4 addresses can be expressed in ipv6, so it is backwards compatible in a way.

That can't be right, Bitcoin is broken! Clearly your screenshot is fake, I can tell by the pixels. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:05:07
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:33:00
Yes, this is true of course. As the value of your holdings grow, though, you tend to spend some. Historically Bitcoin has been used for payment the most after sudden jumps in price. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:09:18
The fee doesn't look fixed here, so it may have just been congestion. It's hard to tell without an actual transaction id. If the wallet offers higher-priority fees, try using them next time.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:26:22
Does Stop And Shop accept Bitcoin now? Did any vendor accept Bitcoin in 2009? This question is ridiculous. Vendors will get on LN  as it gains traction and users.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:59:07
The difference is that one approach involves hoping for the best, and another one doesn't. Whether Bitcoin has value if it's based on hope is an exercise left to the reader. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:25:09
That's due to growth though. Demand caught up with blocksize, which will keep happening for any reasonable blocksize in any scenario where Bitcoin remains in demand.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:14:50
You're posting negative, unsubstantiated garbage in every thread celebrating the price rise. What kind of reaction do you expect? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:23:31
No, they couldn't, Bitcoin is designed to prevent this from happening (and the advances in mining technology make this even more difficult). 
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:05:20
Yeah, wallets contain many addresses so block explorers will only show per address activity. That's good, it makes your addresses more difficult to tie together from blockchain data.
@_date: 2016-12-10 22:32:41
Oh man, that's hilarious. Anything that doesn't have to do with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant is an attempt to change the economics with you people.

I'd like to be whitelisted as well, for the same reasons. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:30:07
Right, because the number of active nodes has been going up as the blocks filled up. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:12:54
OK, one of us has a misunderstanding here, so let's try to find it by starting with the basics:
What does BU's AD setting do?
What value is it set to by default?
What is the percentage of users that change default on installed software on average?
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:58:02
PayPal has lots of users, does that make it decentralized?
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:17:34

@_date: 2016-12-04 20:59:38
I hold the exact opposite opinion to pretty much everything you mentioned. 75% weight limit can be changed in the future if data shows a better number, nor does it have anything to do with SegWit being a soft fork. These are narratives that have no basis in reality. I'm not going to bother debating them, as it's been explained multiple times by various people more qualified than me. Stating these things today just shows that you have your view and will abide by it no matter how many times it's shown to be incorrect.

@_date: 2016-12-17 14:48:32
Core's hardfork plans include much more than just the block size.
@_date: 2016-12-14 03:28:38
Plenty of people believe in it as a store of value, however, as evidenced by price, fees and queue of unconfirmed transaction. I certainly believe that you want it to be a payment system, but it's not there yet, nor is it the main selling point. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:26:54
The other parameters you mention have no effect on the **load** of full nodes and bandwidth. That's the difference. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:48:47
I don't know where you're getting your "facts" from, but here's the [pull request]( for SegWit. It's a little over 5300 lines of code, most of them tests. Core 0.12.1, which I happen to have the source code for, is 500k lines of just C++ code.  1 % is a "majority"? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:05:05
The price rise on such small volume, and the long-term sideways movements with no volume, all indicate lack of supply. Basically nobody is selling, so anything on the market keeps getting bought up, raising the price.
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:57:39
Is this a Jaden Smith's tweet?
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:46:03
LOL, thanks for literally making me laugh on this one :) Estimating delivery is almost impossible when one is leading a software project, doing it for a decentralized payment network trying to break new ground is a complete crapshoot. Based on my understanding I'd expect it to go live sometime in 2017. If SegWit doesn't activate it'll delay LN, since they'll have to handle the additional complexity of malleable signatures. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:15:48
Those are the use-cases I mentioned other than store of value, their effects on price are tiny. The price is determined by exchanges. The way I see it, the recent steady rise is due to diminished supply, both due to the halving, and due to people holding on to their coins instead of selling them. That's why we get steady rise on very low volume, over time. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:10:56




You can take precautions in a closed system you control. Decentralized, by design highly inefficient systems are a very different story.

@_date: 2016-12-19 17:13:31


No, that's totally not how Bitcoin works. Longest proof-of-work is used to pick one valid chain over another. More proof-of-work does not automatically make a chain valid, only in BU's implementation. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:28:16
I'll take Bitcoin as-is forever over one that ended up forking to raise the limit. Lightning can run without SegWit, but an overtaken Bitcoin is worthless.

You're expressing an opinion about a value of a parameter in a distributed network. That makes it a technical opinion regardless of whether you think so or not. "Everyone knows" isn't a statement you can make in this context, technical discussions don't work this way.
I realize it's difficult to understand from your perspective, but this is sort of like poking your head into a design meeting between aerospace engineers and saying "everyone knows the 787 wings can be twice as long". 
 
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:23:08
Bitcoin has the luxury of being a social and political experiment at this point ONLY due to getting the technical decisions right. Many of those decisions are counter-intuitive even to seasoned software engineers, and it only stays viable if right decisions keep being made.

@_date: 2016-07-13 19:13:08
We're mostly in agreement. Once additional point, though - keeping the block at 1MB provides incentives to work on real scaling solutions now, instead of scrambling later on down the line, with much bigger blocks and struggling network (in addition to seeing how the fee market behaves).
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:54:48
That's exactly right. Developers won't have the motivation to work on something that's not needed, and even if developed there would be no incentive to actually deploy or use it.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:55:52
That's because it's the best option for those guys, despite the fees and confirmation times. Outside of those markets, there are plenty of centralized payment networks that are much better than on-chain Bitcoin transactions.

This assumes that the DAO saw all that investment for its declared purpose, as opposed to pure speculation. That's a pretty big assumption.
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:30:38
Bitcoin Core has a JSON-RPC interface you can use for all that.
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:56:41
Think of Bitcoin as digital gold instead of yet another payment network, and Lightning as the actual payment network. That's the reality today, and that's what makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:58:02
There are plenty of physical limits to using gold for transactions, which is why nobody is using it for payment. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:53:06
The reality today is that Bitcoin is not a payment network, regardless of block size. Transactions that take 10 to 120 minutes can't be used for payment, no matter what the fee is. This was the case in 2011, so this isn't new - Bitcoin has failed to gain any traction as a method of payment. It did, however, gained traction as a store of value. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 14:50:19
Lightning provides cheap, instantaneous transactions which bypass the Bitcoin blockchain entirely while still being secured by it. It's the  way to get Bitcoin usable by a significant fraction of the population.

If the bitcoin-qt that the address came from is showing a balance, you can spend it from there.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:51:32
The biggest misconception is that you have to own an entire Bitcoin. Bitcoins are divisible down to 8 decimal places, so you can own exactly as much as you want.
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:26:07
I think you're severely underestimating the median size of a Darkmarket transaction :) But sure, if the fees ever get to a point of 10-20% of a median transaction in those markets, users will look for other means. That's roughly the level of taxes on cannabis in Colorado, IIRC, which people are fine with. We're likely to have viable off-chain solutions by then, however.

Just use the testnet.

You'll need the password if you provided one when creating the paper wallet.

I'm not sure what your point is.

Mycelium on Android has this built-in. It's the easiest way.

If you replicate the database it to the new master first it'll be at most a few seconds of downtime.

Yup, this kills the idea right there, I completely forgot about credit card fraud. Even if everything else is addressed, even if the price is higher to pay for it all, stolen credit card numbers break this approach. 
Too bad, I really hope someone will figure out a way to buy BTC with credit cards eventually. It'll significantly lower the bar to getting them.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:44:56
You don't need bitcoin-qt in the future, just dump the keys from the wallet and import them somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:00:38
Yeah, thought about that too, there are a few ways but fraud is the ultimate show-stopper.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:43:34
This isn't true. bc.i keys are encrypted and decrypted in your browser, they have no access to them - only you do.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:28:47
mtgox doesn't like tor anyway, they'll flag your account and require verification if you use it. All they have to do is require verification via email if a withdrawal from a 'weird' IP is requested.

So while I understand the Bitcoin side of this, how does mutually assured destruction work for cash? Do you accept cash deposits as well? Or do I need Bitcoins to buy more Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:31:27
As far as I know, 401k loans are only penalty-free and tax free in case of a one-time withdrawal in case of hardship or purchasing a primary residence. I'd research that thoroughly first. 
Also, your scenario isn't considering what happens if BTC loses value next year. Are you comfortable spending another 4-5 years just to get back to where you are now?  
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:47:52
I expect a significant price drop over the weekend, easily to around $600.
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:51:43
Wow, ton of negativity in this thread. I keep my bitcoins on an encrypted loop device, that I only access from a live-CD Linux VM image from a remote connection. VM mounts the loop device over the network, so the wallet never exists in decrypted form outside of the VM.
Alternatively I can access the loop image from a live-CD booted laptop, to avoid the risk of keyloggers on the client machine (I consider that risk negligible right now).

Replace "bitcoins" with "dollars" in your post and ask yourself if it makes sense.

Until you can live your life without ever converting Bitcoins to fiat, there's going to be a need for government approval. Or, looking at it the other way, needing government approval for fiat is exactly what makes Bitcoins so attractive.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:22:45
You're not trying to "earn" money, you're trying to get paid for by "wasting a few good hours". You can't get Bitcoins that way for the same reason you can't get dollars.

Watch-only addresses don't need private keys. Mycellium on Android can do that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:32:47
It shows buys AND sells as "leaks". Pretty, but useless.

Sigh, still handling people's money with coffeescript and node.js.

I don't recall anyone complaining about high interest payments when Cyprus banks were doing well. Now that there's a correction, all of a sudden everyone has problems with it.
It was actually handled quite well, all things considered. Insured amounts were untouched, larger investors, who are most likely foreign and can deal with it anyway, took a hit. Taking the historical interest rates into account, actual "hit" is likely much less than the percentage being taken right now.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:41:29
Just use HTTPS for that, mtgox supports it. Using Tor with them is a really bad idea, you're just asking to get your account locked.

Mortgage interest rates are fixed (well, for mortgages worth taking, anyway).
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:11:19
It appears to be treating buys and sells as "leaks". Seems misleading.

It's too early to tell, really. It did legitimize the exchanges somewhat, but only time will tell how the public will interpret this. Looks like China just woke up and decided to sell off a bit.

Great wallet, I love the single-key workflow - exactly what I wanted for ages. One killer feature would make it absolutely perfect (and I'd gladly pay for it) - being able to sign a paper-wallet transaction offline, and broadcast it using a connected phone, via a QR code. That way the private key is never even on an internet-connected device, and I'd feel completely safe spending from my "savings" wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:20:19
Financial institutions can't trade Bitcoins, and prices can't be quoted in Bitcoins. Everything else appears to be business as usual.

Donations are tax-deductible, but not tax exempt. Basically whatever you donate gets taken out of your income, and you're not taxed on it.
