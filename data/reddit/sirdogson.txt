6 francs of BTC, please.

I see... I missed that statement. 
So does that mean by moving to undermine both BTC and subsequently S2X, BCH stands a better chance of surviving?

Gross FUD

I don't think it's strictly regulatory capture as described by Stigler (1971) as there is no regulator to capture.
I do agree that it is an attempt at take over and control.

There's a reasonable amount of 'uneducated' (for want of a better word) money flowing into the system.
They want to buy 'bitcoin'. 
If you manage to have your coin recognized as 'bitcoin' and they buy that instead, you can benefit from the inflow. 
S2X was setting up to attempt to take the name, and now BCH is making a concerted effort. Effectively diminishing the the chances of S2X doing so.

If it is not clear what people want; what is clear is that there is no consensus.

It's a deliberate ploy by BCH to misdirect and capture new entrants.
Sorry to see you caught out, and hope it's resolved well. Hopefully what's learned will be free.

Closing out any high interest non-deductible debt should, in most cases, be a priority. 
A zero% card transfer if available is your first best move.

What a strategy.
Create infighting.
Profit from protecting people from infighting.
I'm going to buy a glazing business then kick a load of windows in.

BCH bait and switch in action.
