It's not a double standard. Just because you think it should be illegal for a corporation to minimise tax in the way they are doesn't make it illegal.

I think that's the problem. So many people are just buying into bitcoin as an investment because they think it's some get rich quick phenomenon.

You should not be making a claim like that when someone is looking for investment advice. It is incredibly irresponsible and naive to even suggest that it won't go lower ever again than what it will here. For all you know, it could be worth a million in a year's time or it could be worth zero.

Two-Bit Idiot can't seem to comprehend that it is the manner in which he posts that turns people against him. Sure, if he leaked the Gox documents and left it at that, then that's fine. But his purpose is for the promotion of his own blog. Even down to the point where he was creating Reddit threads with "breaking news coming in a few hours." He is doing the same thing here with the Bitcoin Foundation. 
Just post your leaks and leave it at that. Stop trying to dramatise it for self gain.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:23:33
Fair enough. Hopefully OP comes through with the video. Thankfully no money tied up in Gox!

Because that's a different exchange and a different time period. The OP is data for the MtGox exchange across a day or two. What you've linked is a two month period at a different exchange (bitstamp). In your link, the vertical axis on the left hand side is the volume traded, and the right hand side is the price in usd. This will help give a better understanding:

It's not reasonable to expect users to have to withdraw bitcoin to keep it safe. That sort of mindset would be disastrous for adoption rates.

Not too many people would be willing to put 43,000 people out of job and start a worldwide recession over this. It's far more productive to fine them for their indiscretion, and have HSBC make changes to avoid it happening in the future. It definitely isn't a fair outcome, but such is life.

Very misleading title. Nothing in the article points to them taking on bitcoin. Not recommending it to large investors =/= opposing it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:06:29
The difference here is that they are out of circulation. As a result it's as if new bitcoins are being created. When they were taken out of circulation the quantity of available bitcoins (supply) reduced.

I can see what you're saying. You would hope that Mark would have the self-motivation and integrity to keep running the business to the best of his ability or to resign.

@_date: 2014-02-21 14:06:46
That's the whole issue. People can't withdraw bitcoins from MtGox so they are cashing out in fiat instead because it has some legal standing if Gox goes bankrupt. As a result of everyone dumping their mtgox stranded btc the price per coin on Gox is tanking. People are willing to get ~150 usd per coin just so their money is in fiat and not btc.

No, I don't think so. And if they have, then the price should have risen when the coins were confiscated due to a drop in supply. Therefore when the coins are reintroduced to the market, there should be a decrease in price.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:43:06
Swap the coins out for any other commodity or asset. The price of the company/entity would decrease if a key asset is not able to be used/out of circulation.

How does it make sense to the world economy as a whole? The closure of HSBC USA would likely trigger a worldwide recession.

In all fairness, as it currently stands it is still very complicated for your average person to purchase Bitcoin and get involved.

That's only because it is as clear as day. Usually anyone who has a clue about it wouldn't make it as obvious. The problem is that people scream for prosecution when things like insider trading happen in the corporate world, but with bitcoin there is no enforceable punishment. How can the bitcoin community stomp out well executed inside trading and the like?

- Government weren't able to prove that HSBC knew where the money was going - unlike Shrem's case.
- HSBC acknowledged that its AML wasn't up to standard and were fined.
- If HSBC went to trial they would lose their banking license and approximately 40,000 Americans could find themselves out of work. (you can preach the old 'too big to fail!!' sarcastic line but the reality is that it's true. Closing down the bank over these charges is not worth the economic cost that would result.)
- Shrem's case appears to be nothing like the case against HSBC.

He is obligated to run an effective AML program. That includes reporting suspicious transactions. You can see in the email transcript between Shrem and the co-owner that they knew the transactions with BTCKing were suspicious. It also includes identifying customers with over $3000 worth. He helped to avoid those laws.
Edit: you can find it all on page 7 of the complaint

Regardless of what medium they use to offload them, it's still an increase (I haven't used the word redistribution because the coins are effectively non-existant with the FBI at the moment) in total supply in the amount of coins available. The price should drop.

And it's also why no individual country has control over their currency. It's called the impossible trinity. You can only have two of the following: control of monetary policy, full capital controls and exchange rate stability.

As a local this is cool to see!
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:34:33
Obviously, but it takes a very long time to tumble that many coins in appropriate proportions. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:33:23
Bitcoin is now too large for amateurs to mine with their standard home setup and be profitable. A few years ago you could've made quite a bit doing it this way. It's still exciting, it's just far more commercialised now.
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:27:28
None, don't bother mining 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:46:12
This is true but it's an extremely optimistic outlook. I don't believe big coin can succeed based solely around that notion. Not enough people would conform to change.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:37:29


I can't see how this is good news. To me it appears that the Chinese Government is concerned about Bitcoin undermining their currency. As such, I feel like this could potentially be the first step towards more stringent measures.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:36:37
Is this good or does it make it seem like just some 'cool' currency that no one takes seriously?
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:11:51
China knows that if any of their financial services get involved with Bitcoin it will take off. It's the first step towards attempting to regulate it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:40:31
How is this good news? I've interpreted that as the first steps towards China making sure that Bitcoin doesn't threaten their currency. They may have more stringent measures in place if it continues to have such an impact.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:48:19
Sure, there's a market for it. But that market is extremely limited due to the fact it's illegal. If the currency is illegal it will never prosper and will be extremely limited.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:31:14
I don't disagree with this. But if it can't be spent on legal goods then the growth of the currency will be capped and cannot grow exponentially.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:05:19
The problem I can't see past is why any government would let Bitcoin grow exponentially. The fiat system is what governments and financial institutions are based around. Whether people like it or not, if those institutions were to collapse, so would the economy. If Bitcoin threatens these institutions in such a way, they can shut the entire thing down with the blink of an eye. China's statement seems to be them saying that they are keeping a very close eye on it to make sure it doesn't do exactly that.

The SilkRoad story is going to give Bitcoin more exposure than it has ever had before. It will bounce back.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:28:35
Until bitcoin settles down it won't be acceptable as a form of currency to pay for anything. No one can accept payment of something this volatile.
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:58:24
This is what I don't understand. He does indeed pay less for the hit than the blackmail. But the target of the hit, owes the killer $500k? The killer is only receiving $150k. So the killer is happy to kill someone and put himself 350k out of pocket? Unless I misread I don't quite understand this part.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:13:58
If retail outlets can't accept bitcoin legally it will have zero value outside of illegal activities. It can't ever go mainstream and it's value would be capped.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:08:29
Bitcoin was probably my only legitimate chance to become a multi millionare in my lifetime. Bouncing around 600-900 now, that boat has set sale :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:30:40
The trouble with the recent volatility of bitcoin is that now there is so much media coverage of bitcoin prices that everytime bitcoin crashes I think it would have to deter a lot of the general public. Given all of the new Mt Gox accounts that were being created when bitcoin was $120-$250 I feel this will scare a lot of the people who purchased at these prices away. If these crashes occur every few months then we have a major problem for all the new users.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:40:20
Well, I think bitcoin would die if that were the only path it could take. Its purpose is to be decentralised
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:09:58
Sure, but it will never be a legitimate currency if it can't be used to purchase things legally.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:42:10
There will be. But like I said, it will kill any chance bitcoin has of being adopted by the masses and its value will be capped by the limited number of users.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:15:52
How can Bitcoin overcome this? Banning exchanges / vendors from dealing in Bitcoin will destroy any value it has.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:43:24
There's a difference between being optimistic and being naive. Like I said, I'm all for the bitcoin movement, but, literally every time a news article is published about bitcoin people are making out as if it is the greatest thing ever. Case in point: the news coming out of China.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:39:01
holy shit, more like this: 
allegedly he did have someone killed already...
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:12:48
Which means in a way it is controlled by government.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:46:17
The government has no reason to support bitcoin. It appears they are concerned that bitcoin could undermine their currency. If financial institutions get involved, bitcoin would take off and make it more of a threat.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:20:51
I can't help but think this is only the beginning. Why would any government let Bitcoin gain serious traction? It threatens governments and the financial services industry. The news coming out of China just proves how easy it is for Bitcoin to be regulated (which is exactly what it's supposed to prevent). Take away the merchants and suddenly Bitcoin has no value.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:18:13
Then this just means that bitcoin will forever be controlled by government as it is susceptible to policy
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:49:33
Is it the bank's fault that an uninformed consumer took out a mortgage that they could not afford? Sure, it's immoral. But just as much blame lies on the individuals who do not understand the system.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:31:46
So Switzerland calls it a currency and China calls it a commodity. If it's a currency then more governments will clamp down.
@_date: 2013-06-20 10:07:19
These types of occurrences would be having a huge impact on adoption rates of Bitcoin. This is not good.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:55:30


Because the idea behind it is that there is no central authority. 
Well sourced, but that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that there's no REASON for them to support it. If bitcoin fulfilled its purpose it would severely hamper the control of banks and governments. Why would they support that? 
There's a big difference between recognising it as a means of online payment and a legitimate currency that is used in real life.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:41:25

How anyone can try and spin it as good news is beyond me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:22:51
There has to be a huge crash coming. This news is only getting worse. No government is going to let Bitcoin threaten their existence.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:42:55
how can the world's largest bitcoin trading platform not be able to handle DDOS etc? they're turning over 100k a day in trading fees. Surely by now the DDOS excuse is getting old....

It was only a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:34:45
When you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a day in revenue, isn't it a bit old now to keep blaming DDOS attacks? without a reliable exchange bitcoin cannot thrive. Mt. Gox is not that reliable exchange.

That's completely different to impacting an entire currency
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:34:18
I wrote here a couple weeks ago how the December 5th announcement was just the beginning of the regulation. Bitcoin continued to undermine their currency and regulation is the result. There's zero reason any government or financial institution would support bitcoin.

I bought 1000 BTC when it was at .80c a few years ago. Sold at $4. I almost cried when I woke up and saw it at $250 one morning
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:05:17
Well said, OP. There is absolutely no reason any government will let bitcoin grow to the point where it undermines their own currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:53:39
There's a massive difference between that and the amount of USD (for example) in circulation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:47:34
I agree. But it needs to be kept in mind that the people are also at fault. Everyone prefers to just blame the banks to make themselves feel better. It's a two way street.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:10:39
I'm all for the Bitcoin movement but lately this sub has just become nothing but a Bitcoin circlejerk. Not every bit of news that comes out about Bitcoin needs to be spun as being something positive.
Edit: please explain down votes. Just look at the news coming out of china as an example..
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:29:00
I hope the people who insisted that the news was good two weeks ago feel pretty stupid right now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:02:02


Central banks don't devalue fiat holdings of all non-governmental accounts. They can increase or decrease the value of the currency with the use of monetary policy, in response to the current economic climate. 
I think a lot of what you've said is more so 'best case scenario' type stuff for Bitcoin; 100 billion worth of bitcoin spread worldwide won't have any real impact on inflation or deflation rates of a major economy. 
As it currently stands, just the process of obtaining bitcoin alone is still far too technical for it to impose any real threat on fiat. 
But yes, in many many years to come, perhaps this could happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:43:23
Sure, go with some. But it's not enough to make it a revolutionary currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:40:28
It's been mentioned hundreds of times. I submitted a thread on it. It just got downvoted because 'the news coming out of china is good!!'
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:33:01
Why would any government or financial institution support bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:05:03
For a revolutionary 'internet' currency OTC trade isn't exactly practical.

@_date: 2013-12-17 01:06:27
If bitcoin became illegal it would be the end of it. There would be a cap on the growth of bitcoin  and it's intrinsic value would be close to zero. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:40:44

@_date: 2013-10-02 16:37:56

@_date: 2013-12-06 15:15:00
The fact that governments still do have complete control over Bitcoin defeats the very purpose of it. Government regulators could easily ban exchanges and vendors from using Bitcoin. If that happens, Bitcoin will be destroyed. If Bitcoin can't be spent it has no intrinsic value.
edit: i am all for bitcoin. I just feel the news coming out of China is devastating.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:02:43
If you have no means of obtaining bitcoin in the first place, and that it can't be redeemed for a legitimate currency, what value does it have? Zero.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:22:47
Surely this isn't a surprise to anyone. There's no reason for financial institutions to support bitcoin. The same applies for government. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:40:47
How is this good news? I've interpreted that as the first steps towards China making sure that Bitcoin doesn't threaten their currency. They may have more stringent measures in place if it continues to have such an impact.

Here's the indictment showing the first murder that DPR thought he paid $80k for- turns out the guy he paid was undercover.

I thought the same. It wasn't very well written or edited.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:36:54
How does that relate to **proportionally** devaluing the fiat holdings of all non-governmental accounts when the purchasing power gain by one person is offset equally by the loss of the person not receiving the printed fiat?
I don't mean to be coming across provocative, I am genuinely curious as to what you're saying.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:15:31
How in anyway is a government banning bitcoin a good thing? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:13:03

@_date: 2013-12-17 07:02:35
Exactly this. I think this subreddit has become a delusional circlejerk that lacks any economic understanding. If bitcoin has no means of being spent , there is no value in it. The problem is that the government still controls the entire concept. Ban bitcoin and it would basically die.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:53:38
Or, they are asking the banks to steer clear because if the banks got involved then bitcoin would really take off (whether people like it or not) and threaten their currency even more.
Why would the Chinese government have an interest in seeing bitcoin succeed? Why would any government want to see bitcoin succeed? It threatens the entire system
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:11:13
Why would it return to norm? The news from China will devalue Bitcoin. That's how markets work, and that's exactly what we're seeing. It's massive news.

Bitcoin may not require banks but it does require means of spending it in order for it to have any value. This news is a lot worse than anyone in cared to admit. And finally, the markets are reacting correctly to it. I've said all along this could be the first massive crash of Bitcoin.  Quite frankly, it should be. 
I'm heavily invested in Bitcoin, but I am still being realistic.

@_date: 2013-12-17 04:50:25
Clearly they do. The market reacts appropriately to ever single piece of government news. If a currency becomes illegal the bitcoin has no value outside of black markets. As such the value of the currency will be capped and cannot grow.

The difference this time is that the market is reacting to some very bad news coming out of China. Governments may clamp down harder on it. There is absolutely no way they will allow bitcoin to flourish. Banning China's financial services from getting on board was the first step towards stopping Bitcoin. They are aware that if the financial services got involved, Bitcoin would have taken off. It's the first sign of regulation.
