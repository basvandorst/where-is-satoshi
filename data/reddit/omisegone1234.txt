McAfee made the viruses they fixed. Would not put much trust in to him.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:12:43
So how low is it going to go? 1k or should we just buy back in at 3k?
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:54:20
In all honesty you could be correct. It's like people in 99% of the coins that are not legit hold on until the guys just walk away and stop updating the site. I actually bought in a ton of ICOS and never got my coins and some are still going like they are legit lol. I message, hey, can I get my coins lol. I don't have to tell you what their answer is.

This is a typical bull and horns formation used by the Zulus in the past.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:55:21
That would be amazing! I will buy the dip then it will drop to zero.
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:29:34
That's for sure the ant farm forming and will head in to the iron triangle form the the wax on wax off phase will kick in. Pat morita will come back to life and then the rocket ship will form and to the moon.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:05:09
If the moon is in the center of the earth I might believe it.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:50:51
Ever heard of a falling knife? We are not in a dip.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:02:37
Why? crypto is fun. I'm not married and have no kids so money to me is nothing. No responsibilities. It's like going to Vegas without having to take the time and fly there. I just don't hodl, think it's stupid. You need to sell to get some money. Think I want to be the next Soros and spend my money at the end to try and destroy the world? No. Just enjoy some good steaks, good women and good drinks.

Some people did some things.

Nothing ever happens to the rich and powerful. Maybe they will have to pay a fine.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:44:17
I know you are joking but you are not buying a dip. bitcoin is up massive this year. This was the second bull run since 2017, it only hit around 14k so now wait a few more years, probably going back to 3k.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:31:34
I bought the dip. [

The life boats are lowering. Get one before it's to late.

I heard after we Build a colony on Mars and have it a thriving new world in the year 2400 bitcoin will hit 100k. Wait damn, never mind. Mars bucks will be out by then and bitcoin will die.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:03:43
They are shorting all the way down.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:47:21
So funny. All the youtube kids and people on tv always read the charts after the fact but the 100% thing is they never have one clue about the future.  Very bored suckers watch them and think they are smart. Hey look! See this triangle here, look!! This one is called the elephant leg, see it !!!! seee it!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:47:20
Lets make a toast to waiting another 5 years for bitcoin to moon. Guess we have a long time to build up more fairy dust. I mean, bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:48:05
When moon?
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:03:10
Bitcoin just has a little gash. Blood in the streets will be way down around 3k again.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:52:50
This is the 400th time bitcoin is dead. lol.
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:23:22
Yes ! When Elon musk starts his colony on Mars bitcoin. Will be his new worlds currency. he is going to change the name of mars to bitcoin musk land. Technically he could stake claim to mars. He will set up a billion computers running on solar to mine bitcoin. That's the real reason hes going to mars. He will also create his new cologne,  Elon musk fir men made on mars. Only purchasable by bitcoin 10 k per bottle.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:45:23
We have had a good year. Get ready for the drop back to 3k and repeat next year. Next year should be a nice run up again but this year is over and done with accept for the market crashing.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:59:18
Why not hope it drops back to 1 buck? Why 3500 , you scare me. You must be rich. Eh don't want to buy btc for a buck. 3500 is fine with me.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:46:31
That is called the drooping elephant trunk pattern or the crazy kangaroo leg. What type of TA guy are you?
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:45:08
It was a good time to buy at the start of the year. Not now!.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:00:55
What happened to moon? All the youtuber TA guys said moon incoming?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:15:46
I zoomed out and see a death spiral happening. Time to wait a for more years if it ever reaches ten k again. Probably going back to under 3k in the month.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:20:43
Can't wait until it goes below 5k.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:14:53
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:06:10
There is no such thing as experts. If they where experts they would be rich and never talk to us. It's all about manipulation but the rich. Always will be.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:53:50
The dip is like 2k.
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:49:06
Think buying around 1 dollar was a good time but now? all these clowns keep saying bitcoin to a million are just con men . When the stock market crashes it's going to take crypto with it so let's be honest, bitcoin could easily drop back to 300 for years.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:42:14
Hodl? lol. Why hodl when you could sell now and buy bitcoin for 2k in a month or so? I've been sitting out for months now. Hmm 120 billion cap to 380 billion cap in a few months. should it drop ? YEAH! I am still not buying now. I don't see the point, the market is so manipulated. The big money want's to kill crypto. I came up with my own strat. First is that you have to realize there is no such thing as investing. Being in stocks and crypto are like me telling my friends I'm going to invest some money in Vegas in blackjack. Rule number 2. Don't lose. I don't care if the market gets away and runs up. I lose zero if that happens. The only way I can lose is if I put in the money. Right now I'm shaking because I want to buy in but I could wake up today with the market down another 50 billion. I have my target. If it hits 150 billion cap again I will be foolish and go all in. If It drops from there I will keep buying more.  Bitcoin is still up massive this year. The drop could be brutal.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:02:24
Think big! 10 bucks.

I really would have rather been a farmer in life. Plant my corn and sell it for profit. If I failed I would have a million corn dildos to shove up my butt.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:51:07
You get drunk, pull your pants down and see your own penis staring back at you after bitcoin drops 20% in a day and you talk to it and touch it. You then realize you had shorted it in a very drunken state. You cheer and touch your self more and yell how much money you made.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:17:25
Abandon ship! get the life boats out!!!
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:25:04
I hear they get broken in to all the time, the locals are looking for the bitcoins inside the machine.
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:01:17
So it's actually the Beer coin. Awesome.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:19:16
Buttcoin is going back down to 3k before any run up.

Yeah, like the south park episode. ANNDDDDDD It's gone!
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:14:54
You can hodl until bitcoin goes to zero. Nobody cares. This is the last time to cash in in the history of bitcoin. Why do you think all the rich people are saying it's going to 1 million? They are cashing out. I'm sure there will be pump and dumps for years but it's never hitting even 20k again.

Bitcoin bums are the future.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:14:01
I think with this drop most are using it to buy drugs and drink.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:12:58
Snail head pattern forming right now.

I bought a cheap metal detector and found tree fiddy in my yard.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:52:29
Its clear. The market cap is going to drop to 100 billion then after the rich load up it will moon.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:42:45
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:48:41
Leave them alone. Future homeless people are still people.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:47:33
Bitcoin died again. Damn. This is like the 400th time it died.
