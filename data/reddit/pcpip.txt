While I like this idea, if u/rekcahxfb was going to do that, why not run the giveaway that way from the beginning? Everyone's a winner and coins are going all over the place.

Unfortunately, the bank "accidentally" giving you extra money is still considered theft and is punished with jail time if you don't return the funds. Mt. Gox "accidentally" giving you extra bitcoins has no repercussions.

Promo isn't working. The email's fine print says "This offer applies to purchases made on the Fancy website and mobile applications."
Try to check out with bitcoin and the discount isn't applied. Their live chat knows nothing about bitcoin or the promo.

Wow, I logged into Mt. Gox not less than 10 minutes ago.

That looks really secure! Thanks!

We added Bitcoin as a payment method to our online store in the beginning of December with Coinbase. It's worked very well and is handled completely separate from any other gateways or processors. JPMChase isn't going to know you take Bitcoin unless they shop regularly at your site.

I run a small a small home-goods online store. I added Bitcoin as a payment option right after Thanksgiving. I didn't do any publicity or marketing alerting the world that we were now accepting Bitcoin. 
Through the holiday season we had far more Bitcoin transactions than I ever would have guessed. Many of them came with a follow-up email saying they were happily surprised to see Bitcoin as an option during checkout and they thanked us for supporting the crypto-economy. While we didn't cash in on or exploit the Bitcoin 'buzz,' we got a really nice warm feeling that we were doing something to support a growing community. I think that's what it should be all about.
