Greed won't raise the price, that will only backfire. Hype is empty without intrinsic value. There is no reason to believe there will ever be a usage, and there is no reason for anyone to start using it, since trading in it costs more than it's worth. Current currencies are stable enough to survive multiple economic disasters. If there ever is a global currency, it will most likely be constructed like the Euro was.
I'd say an extinction event is more likely than crypto ever raising as it once did. Sorry to tell you, but it ain't looking good.

A currency purely used to trade isn't a currency, it's a middle man. You might as well have your bank convert the money for you.


I don't think so, I don't live in your fantasy land, so it seems kind of unlikely.

I can confirm, I can't read computer.

So not only do you have to invent a super out of the way example for this to work, but you also ignore that this transfer costs quite a lot of money, so you'll be spending 2 bucks on a transaction of 20 bucks that arrives as 19 bucks only to be retrieved as 18, because you still can't use bitcoin. On top of that, you also have to be a dick about it.
I'd say any way other than bitcoin

crypto bubbled because there was a belief that is no longer there. The hype has properly died down, and people who invest now can see from history that they stand to lose a lot of money.
Many countries in the EU are managing debt quite alright. It's a country to country thing, so it's very hard to comment on. also, I'm pretty sure "fiat growth" is a made up term. It is also strange that you're talking about monetising debt and immediately devaluing it.


Really good, thank you?


While there is a certain potential here, no government on earth would back it. The question is raised however, if bitcoin is used as a currency, would it not essentially function like the gold standard? Why would we want to go back to that?


Citation needed. A lot. It really can't trend to 0 though, can it?

This is a terrible comparison. Gas is a product, its price is based on supply and demand. In fact, since it is based on a finite resource, we can say with certainty that it will inevitably go above $3. It is something we can observe and we can compute an optimal value for.
Crypto currencies on the other hand are not products, they are currencies. But they're not connected to any type of economy, making them even more unpredictable. There is currently no practical use for it other than making money off it. There is nothing to stimulate the value of bitcoin to go up.
All this response shows is that you don't know economics, and maybe should consult someone else to check your personal financial decisions for you.

Ohhh, you mean printing money.


Ohh, written off. Say that then. And not both, I'm sure. Also, will it really?


Fiat currency, the current system that is working around the world. 


That's what I'm asking you?


Are you saying british people could afford 20 times as much tea 100 years ago? What statistics is that based on? Doesn't purchasing power grow continuously?
I feel like you don't have an economics degree.

I feel like the belief that Bitcoin is going to grow beyond it's top value ever again is more ridiculous than any religion. Not only is it based on nothing, it's actively against the current trends.

It literally has no use. It's a thing you put money in hoping you'll get more back. It's basically a slot machine.

There is no good reason to believe it will happen again.
