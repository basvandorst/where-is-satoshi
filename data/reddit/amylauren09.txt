If you choose cex.io, First of all you have to verify your identity and card. You have to give high quality pictures for verification. If not they they ask resubmit again. Yes, You can buy btc fast and easy but I would recommend to buy eth because btc transactions fees are little bit high now. It depends on what do wanna do with btc.

Mining is good but not cloud mining that's why. I talked about cloud mining not about hardware mining.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:32:32
The stupid thing is you are willing invest large amount of money on cloud mining. I have seen your previous activities. You already spammed cloud mining sites on here. Sounds like you are going to recommend cloud mining sites for us lol :P

If you are newbie day trading is hard for you. You can buy some altcoins to hodl long term. Holding is one of best way to make money from bitcoin.

I personally do not recommend cloud mining because it's sucks. You don't have any idea invest that money to good ICO or buy some good altcoins? Idk you are beginner or not but that's better than cloud mining.

Localbitcoins is good if you find good trusted buys. You can withdraw your bitcoin using cex.io and coinbase too.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:35:53
You can choose trusted seller on localbitcoins. I woul recommend cex.io is good one to buy bitcoin with your card or bank account. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:30:25
Don't sell your bitcoin just hodl and will see what happens.
