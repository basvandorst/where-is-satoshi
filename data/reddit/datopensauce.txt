If you use the currency's software client (i.e. run it on your machine rather than use a website) then you can generate a wallet while offline.

That's terrible mate. Good luck!

That and there's no universe in which I'm gonna pay 60 fucking quid to withdraw in GBP. Fucking bonkers!

I read that Medium article the other day. Where can I read about this sub's side/view on things?

I don't think so really. They're still on copper phone lines so they can only max out at like 72Mbps.

Huh, skids did something good for once.

Just noticed myself. Not looking for a new pool though. Anybody know why? They don't have a blog post or anything detailing why they're shutting down.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:23:17
Same. I don't really understand the drama. I don't think I care too much either.

That tweet is from 27th November, not 27th April lol.
Probably got hit by market saturation. Oh well.

Awesome! I use Electrum now but if I had enough storage space I'd run a full client.

No. We need someone who knows the necessary hashtags.

Unless you use a thin client like Electrum, the best way to do this would be to torrent a 'blockchain bootstrap' or something like that. I remember years ago when the blockchain wasn't even that big, we'd torrent down the bulk of it and put that in the client's directory. It'd pick it up and sync the rest. I don't know if people still do that these days.
