That's the same business, there was an issue with the original domain that is being sorted out, and in the meantime the site's been moved to  ;-)
@_date: 2012-08-02 02:50:14
I'll do that, thank you!

I think maybe the address you were sending to was an email I'm no longer using, I've updated the address on the site, but here it is in case you want/need it:  bitpantry
I'm glad you got your package, thanks!

Hi, I apologize for the delay, our site was down for a few days and I'm getting caught up on orders now.  I shipped a few out a few days ago, and am shipping the rest out tomorrow.  What was your order? I'll let you know the status of it.
@_date: 2012-11-14 00:22:06
No problem at all, and again, I apologize for the delay.  I've shipped that order, I think you should be receiving it in the mail soon!

I'll go ahead and make a notation on the 'Welcome' page about which items can and cannot be shipped internationally.  We have shipped cookies internationally (to the U.K.), so the stance we've taken thus far is that the baked goods can but the bacon cannot.  Shipping costs are automatically figured for you once you get to the payment and shipping sections when placing an order.  Sadly, I don't think we're quite to the point of being able to open franchises yet!

Working on that, thanks for pointing it out!

It's true, for right now international shipping is a bit steep, unless you're ordering several things all at once.  We're sorry about that, but we'll be looking into any possible ways to make that better for you.  Also, we'll be adding more items that aren't quite so time sensitive in terms of freshness, like beef jerky, which won't have to be shipped via Priority and so should cut down on the shipping.

Just thought we'd let you all know there are some new items on the site, including beef jerky!  Check it out!

Agreed, we always like to hear feedback from our customers, it's what helps us become better at serving you!  Just FYI, there are reviews of the items on the site from previous customers ;-)

We are happy to work with any type of dietary restrictions for any items.  With some things it's obviously not really workable (like the candied bacon), but I'm more than happy to modify or create entirely new recipes based on a customer's specific requests.
