Switched to Gemini a couple months ago, never looked back.

Are you in the USA?

I'm guessing your tag was wrong. As long as the receiving address is correct, Bittrex can find the transaction and credit your account.

It's the same goddam sheep that knocked him down twice. Fuck that sheep.

at least I got to experience the joy of downvoting it first.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:20:48
What was the response from Bittrex?

I know someone who has also been in touch with Patrick, going through the same back and forth for years. Poor guy is losing his mind over it. Way more than 15.5 BTC.

Love was changing the minds of pretenders

Haha, I thought the same thing when I saw this post.

Bitcoin isn't a product, it's a currency. It's like asking if dollars go on sale for black friday.

I really don't think $550/month will raise any flags. Just be sure you pay your taxes.

hodling is a full time job.

Ledger Nano S was the best crypto purchase I have made.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:24:26
Look up 'Long-Term Capital Gains Tax'
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:27:55
how does that work?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:44:22
Is this clickbait? The answer won't surprise you.

I consulted my bank who helped me with the wire transfer. If you have questions, your bank should be able to assist.

It depends on the tax laws where you live.It might fall under income or capital gains tax. Would be worth it to speak with a tax advisor.

Unless you filed a claim before the deadline... they gone.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:57:32
may as well add Bitcoin Gold into your equation.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:29:47
Thanks Danny, I guess my question is what is the benefit of doing this? Are taxes different?

Get rid of the tape and have that sucker framed.

I only have to sell a couple BTC to make the market pump... 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:18:04
yeah he's real thankful... lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:25:27
Looks sold out. Will there be more prints available?

Save your secret key and you will be able to recover with an alternative application (ie. Coinomi)

I know someone who is part of the mtgox settlement. He said he "might" receive the value of his coins at the time of closing in today's BTC. So basically approx 1/10 of today's value... total bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:55:46
zoomed out... still stressed.

Sadly, I've invested in most of them.
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:12:07
I'm not sure. I just used it as an example.
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:11:14
I sold at 6350... you are all welcome
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:22:50
