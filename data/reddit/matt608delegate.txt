It needn't be made into an abstract philosophical issue when its actually quite simple. Everyone knows that a relatively stable currency is better and we all know they're not perfectly stable.  It doesn't need to be perfectly stable, as long as it's stable enough, which the major fiats currencies are (USD, EUR, GBP, CNY etc).  We cryptoheads dislike fiat for other reasons, not because of its stability.  If bitcoin could be as stable as USD that would be great.  And it can, bitUSD by BitShares is stable crypto.  It works.  Why bend over backwards to attack a strawman about the impossibility of absolute stability, which no one is even asking for it?

This was a great episode.

This is why I'm so interested in BitShares DPOS because it is a voting system that is going to evolve into something potentially useable by the world to govern itself.

People interested in this should check out BitShares Play.  They are developing a system where in-game items are put on a blockchain and tradeable with items from other games... it's pretty awesome.

It's the title chosen by coindesk.

You can use the real bitGold, bitSILVER, bitUSD, bitEUR, bitCNY, bitBTC all on the bitshares decentralised exchange from anywhere in the world. Metaexchange is an instant bridge into the ecosystem.  We at BitShares are a decentralised community so there is no official party line about whether we believe in bitcoin. Personally, I think it's network effect is unstoppable. 
It's time for the real blockchain bitGOLD to get recognition.  A decentralised service for a decentralised future.

BitGOLD is a decentralised solution that is fast and not cumbersome at all.  It's gold on a blockchain available for the whole world without limits.  Plus holders earn a yield and can buy tiny fractions of an ounce, it's the 3rd bitasset asset listed here:

Ouch, hope you get it back.  
Don't trade on centralised exchanges.  Use the decentralised exchange - BitShares.org.

bitGOLD meets your exact requirements, here are the BitShares assets:   You'll see Gold is the 3rd one down, the collateral rates are shown too, that is locked up BTS which will buy back the gold at the price feed within 30 days if you put it up for sale.  It's a cryptocurrency that trades at the gold price.
This system is open source and decentralised, like bitcoin and unlike the alternatives proposed like bitreserve or coinapult.

Well, those who do won't lose their coins like the people trading on bter, poloniex, mintpal, the endless list.  Survival of the fittest.

A safe place to store BTC is in bitBTC, which earns interest, by using metaexchange.info as an instant bridge.   Keeping it on the bitshares decentralised exchange as bitBTC is the future, then people can trade it against bitUSD without hacking risk while getting exposure to the same market.
I hope these thieves are caught and the money returned.

Fiat is based on fractional reserves.  1 bitBTC is exchangeable for 1 BTC worth of BTS which is exchangeable for BTC.  So the difference compared to fiat is that with bitBTC you can see the collateral reserves backing it, which insures that your bitBTC is exchangeable for real BTC.  
The collateral reserves backing bitBTC are at 240%

You can spend bitUSD + bitFIATs anywhere you can spend bitcoin, or least will be able to imminently (in a matter of weeks).

Convert... to fiat?
but why
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:13:48
Yep nothing is safter than cold storage.  But you can't trade from cold storage.  With bitBTC you can trade against USD, gold, silver etc because the exchange is in the wallet.  It's the most secure exchange for trading.  It's the future of bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:44:14
Correct.  BTS has a known price as determined by price feeds from exchanges e.g.
