Where did you get that 210k btc number? ballpark is fine, just want to know your source.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:39:11
How do you know that?
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:18:31
He can see hidden orders, he can see where peoples stops are, he can see where liquidations will take place, he can see when there are big deposits of btc or fiat, he is privy to information such as if a large client (individual, hedge fund or institutional) was inquiring about use of their exchange, etc. It is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL and shady.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:29:35
What percentage of your total bitcoins that bitfinex held does the 120k btc that was stolen represent? answer this question, stop dodging it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:04:04
Why do you refuse to answer the only important question? What percent of the total amount of btc that finex held does that 120k represent? A rough estimate will be fine, thanks in advance.

You have no idea if he uses other accounts, you have no idea if he is uses someone else as a proxy, you have no idea if he is trading on other exchanges based on his insider info, he can see hidden orders, he can see where peoples stops are, he can see where liquidations will take place, he can see when there are big deposits of btc or fiat, he is privy to information such as if a large client (individual, hedge fund or institutional) was inquiring about use of your exchange, etc. It is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL and shady, and no it is not at all ridiculous to say that if you work for a bitcoin exchange that you cannot trade bitcoin on your exchange, it IS ridiculous that you pretend that what he is doing is okay.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:11:18
You are so anxious to correct the definition of CSO, but you don't deny that he trades on his own exchange while having access to insider information, any idiot can see that is a clear conflict of interest.

during a real crash people dump all the "safe haven" assets to raise money, just look at gold in the 2008 collapse. it was supposed to be a safe haven but just went down with the rest of the market.

if your average is higher than this then you have made some seriously bad decisions
@_date: 2014-09-25 00:01:29
Well you can limit your loss by limiting how much is in your account on a given exchange. And technically even when you are margin called you usually still have 10% or so of your assets left in your accounts, so it's also not a total wipeout except in the most extreme of circumstances. Anyway, it's not like most people are keeping their net worth in fiat on an exchange to short bitcoin with like some people are keeping virtually their entire net worth in bitcoin.

You are 100% correct but people here are more interested in having a witchhunt rather than thinking logically.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:35:27
Yes, you clearly have not tried shorting there, or any of the other places I listed.
Finex does indeed have maintenence requirements where they liquidate your position, as do all of the other entities that I listed. Thus, you cannot lose more than you have in your account. If there were losses incurred beyond that due to market volatility, the exchange and the lenders would be on the hook for that, not the person shorting.
You don't seem to understand how shorting works via all major bitcoin trading platforms, which is different from shorting in equity markets or naked short selling. 
And yes, you do need an "account" to short via every major bitcoin trading platform. In a fringe case where someone drew up a contract to borrow coins directly from an individual to short, then sure, their losses will not be capped. Good luck collecting on that in court. In any case, such a situation is not what people are referring to when they discuss a possible short squeeze and is thus irrelevant. Virtually all bitcoin shorting takes place using the platforms I listed and when shorting via any of them, your losses are capped to the amount that is in your account. Feel free to ask anyone who has actual experience doing this (which you clearly do not) and they will corroborate this.

lol. "for some reason"
no one knows how many btc were stolen from gox while they were warned about it for months and months. only gox knows if its a negligible amount or a catastrophic amount.

@_date: 2014-09-23 17:04:07
Please tell me how I am going to lose more than the amount in my finex account by shorting. I look forward to your reply.
Maybe you should try it before you contribute to the many misconceptions concerning shorting that permeate this subreddit.
Whether I am shorting on bitfinex, bitvc, okcoin, 796 or btc.sx, the most I can lose is the amount that is in my account. That is what I mean by "or wherever", this is irrespective of the amount of leverage used.

So, someone explain this to me. China has comprised around 65-70% of market volume with most of that being at Huobi. If big volume is suddenly back at BTCChina, and if there is not a corresponding decrease in Huobi volume, then what is China's share of overall market volume going to be now? 85%? 90%? This is just getting laughable at this point.

I'm reposting my comment from the other thread here. I really hope this gets followed up on.
This looks like pretty damning evidence to me. Even if there are some issues with the exact web traffic stats it seems to me that you are still doing an apples to apples comparison so the concerns would still be valid.
Also on Huobi's own website they themselves disclose page views, I can tell you that each time I refresh one of their notices I see the view counter go up by one so it is not even just tracking unique visitors. I know that I myself go to Huobi's announcement pages fairly regularly as do several other western investors from this very community. So how many of those page views are from us?? This seems very strange and like it could be a smoking gun.
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:54:21
When you short bitcoin via finex or wherever, the most you can lose is the amount in your account, so your risk is capped in precisely the same way. 
"The sky is the limit for what you risk to lose by shorting bitcoin" is a totally wrong statement.

Hi Roger. Congrats on scamming okcoin into accepting your totally one-sided contract. I hope you paid CZ well. If you have a case, take them to court. But you know you don't. You know your contract is not legally enforceable and would be thrown out of literally any court on Earth. By the way, thanks for all of your assurances regarding Gox. Truly, you are a pillar of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:50:07
lol you are being used buddy congrats
@_date: 2015-05-26 11:02:32
Roger Ver got some idiot at okcoin to sign a totally lopsided and absurd contract that would never be upheld by any court. Changpeng is an idiot to accept that contract in the first place and I'm not at all surprised if Ver bribed him to do so. If Changpeng was not bribed then he is simply a moron. The contract is ridiculous and so is all of the hand-wringing over it from people like the OP. In fact the OP probably is Ver considering it is a brand new account that has done nothing but comment on this issue.

you are the bagholder bitcoin deserves, but not the one it needs right now. so we'll dump him. because he can take it. because hes not our bagholder. hes a silent buyer, a watchful pauper. a dark hodler.
