Lol I'm not sure what you meant by reducing the golden state to dust. We're not doing that bad I think. But then again, we're also having to carry the rest of the U.S. in terms of producing gdp for the nation. So maybe if we didn't have to do that...

We should let Trump come and run our state. It would probably make triilllioonsss. And we would have a yuuuuge wall around the whole state!

There is some truth to what you say. I think people who venture into politics and policy making here in Cali tend to have their idealistic views checked pretty hard rather quickly. It does suck that we have gangs, a lot of which actually we're started by Americans here in the US. And we also have to cope with the rise in income inequality. But I feel there is some value in caring for the lowest, most forgotten citizens in society. Other countries that model this behavior have proven that people can be rehabilitated back into society after experiencing extreme poverty and maybe addictions of various types. I think the whole borders argument just serves to distract from the real issue which is higher education that is just too expensive and access to clean healthy food, which we are doing better on here on the west coast. Naturally people want to live in desirable places. It's no surprise that a lot of people in the US and other countries continue to move to California. This place is freakin progressive and open to ideas. We practically built so many tech related industries right here in California from nothing.

This I agree with.
