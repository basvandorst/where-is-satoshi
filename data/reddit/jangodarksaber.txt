I'm confused as to how the system works. If a merchant accepts Lightning Network clients as payment, can the buyer use any coin?

He's talking about credit/debit cards.

I'm only upvoting this because I want other people to suffer like I did for having seen this.

I never said it does?

Serious question from an outsider. Do you expect Electrum to see widespread adoption within the next 5 - 10 years? The coin itself looks promising but without people accepting it as payment what's its actual worth?

And acceptability

With the price of all these alt coins being very volatile, how would that effect the seller's wallet if say a buyer paid with a coin that was quickly devaluing?

In 1998 $20 was worth about $30 in 2019.

This chart is skewed and misrepresentation.  The graph shows the difference between $1 and $3 as the same as the difference between $13000 and $24000. Any newcomer seeing this will see a misrepresentation of it's performance.
Bitcoin isn't going to crash to zero but we shouldn't be trying to trick people either.

You do realize sometimes companies/stocks go under and never recover right? Bitcoin is no different than any other coin other than reputation.
