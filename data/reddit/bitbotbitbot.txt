Bitcoin doesn't need to be able to process every single transaction in order to suck a large portion of global value into itself. The virtuous cycle of it's value incentivising the increase in it's security, which increases it's value, coupled with it's unparalleled origin story, censorship resistance, and immuntability are the reasons that is happening. 
And no, you can not scribble on your napkin and determine the value of this revolutionary invention of an entirely new asset class, I don't know why anyone would think they should be able to. The only thing you can do is watch as the market actors collectively make the determination. All *you* can do is decide whether or not you will control any portion of the rare units of value measurement yourself, or if instead you be convinced to forgo this and acquire the wooden and iron pennies that people are constantly hawking as cheap knockoff alternatives.

People have been predicting that bitcoin was going to "go to zero" for like 7 years or more, since before it hit $1. Any prediction as to when this is actually going to happen?
At this rate it will be over $100,000 in a few years and you naysayers will still be on here telling people how it is about to go to zero at any time.

Dude most of the entire history of bitcoin has been characterized by abnormal growth, that's what it does. Your strategy is flawed, you are just looking at the chart and guessing when the price will drop, you are not using any discreet definition if "parabolic growth", and even if you were it wouldn't change the fact that what you are doing is essentially a variation of a Martingale. You are virtually garunteeing that you will miss out on potential large future gains, should bitcoin do another exponential run-up, because at some point in the beginning of it you will look at the tea leaves and convince yourself that you can sell and buy back lower, except it will never go lower. Do realize that there are lots of people that sold at $15, and $75, and $150, and $1500, and $5000, and $9000, all hoping to buy back in "on the dip", except it was a dip that never came and they missed out on their chance to own thousands, or tens of thousands, or millions of dollars worth of bitcoin?

[unforgeable costliness](
The demand is based on the enforced scarcity due to unforgeable costliness. 
Anything with this quality that is also easily transportable, fungible, and durable is likely to come to be used as money (bonus if it is easily hidden). Bitcoin is costly to produce because of the hardware and electricity required, and to a lesser degree cooling and internet connection. These things can't be faked. It was purposefully created having these qualities.

Buffet won't buy OR short bitcoin because he doesn't understanding it (a good idea), which he admits. In the time that he has been saying it is a bubble, 4 or more years have gone by, and bitcoin has gone from $200 to over $10,000. 
Buffet is good at valuing old-school companies but he isn't technically able to grasp bitcoin, and I don't think he really gets the historical context of [money as a ledger system]( and how much it can change in a relatively short period of time.
 [Marc Andreessen and Balaji]( are much smarter and more informed.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:07:49


This is completely unnecessary. Bitcoin can store value in whatever portion of the coins remain. Coin scarcity is a core strength, not a weakness. The only way individual satoshis can become rare in comparison to the value that people desire to store in bitcoin is if it grows to a world changing degree, and then we will just move some decimal places or use an additional layer pegged to satoshis. If that ever happens there will be technical, social, and economic problems that none of us can possibly foresee. But a lack of coins will not be one of them. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:58:37

Yep. Unforgeable, provable, costliness. I don't see how proof of stake can ever match this. The tokens are simply not costly to produce to the same degree that pow tokens are.

@_date: 2018-01-11 12:01:04
It is costly in a self referential kind of a way. I didn't say that proof of stake has no value proposition, just that pow is a much stronger one. I takes real physical resources to generate bitcoins, silicone and electricity. There is no way to fake this. Satoshi can not generate more coins just because he has coins. The generation of new bitcoins has provable, unforgeable cost. POS is just entries on a ledger replicating themselves.

LOL. Do you realize that there are thousands of poor suckers like you who don't have any bitcoin because they thought they could sell in the rise and by back on the dip?  People tried the same thing the last time it went to $1 and $3 and $10 and $40 and $100 and $500 and $800 and $1200 and $1750 and $4000 and $6500 and $8000. If it goes to $14000 today you have no way of knowing if it will ever go lower again.

High volatility is acceptable to many people when it is accompanied by a high expected return.
The USD value of my bitcoin savings account has fluctuated a lot over the years, but like any one else who has stuck with it for years I have benefited greatly from my preference for a deflationary currency with inelastic supply.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:16:49
I'll take 10x gains and 50% corrections. It's worked out very well so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:55:37
I think it is quite possible that we go higher than 100,000. People underestimate the implications of a borderless currency with true inelastic supply.
When you try to time the market and sell off when it rises to buy lower later is almost guaranteed that you will miss out on huge gains like that should they happen. Because when they do happen the price will go through many points where you are certain it has to come back down, but it won't. I sold bitcoin to buy a new car when we hit $2500. I was foremost simply using my savings to buy something I needed, but still, I *did* hope to replace then coins when it dropped back down, which of course I was pretty certain would happen. And we know how that went...
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:07:21
Me too, except I have sold about half. I didn't sell to buy the dips though, I sold to buy stuff, which is why I earn and save money, to buy stuff.

It might be more fair, but money is not fair.
Some people got to pick up gold nuggets off the ground in california in 1849. If I go pan for gold all day now I probably won't even find a gram.


It is actually BOTH, there is causation in both directions. Bitcoins do have a high value because they are difficult to generate, and are difficult to generate because there is a huge demand, and thus competition, for them. This is the way it was designed to work.


You might think it is more fair, but bitcoin's pow has a stronger value proposition and is more secure. Like mining gold, it takes actual resources to create new bitcoins. 


That may be technically true but it does not matter. When it comes to value it is the human perspective that matters, and what humans have always valued and used as money are items with provable and unforgeable costliness, which POS tokens do not have to the degree that POW coins do.

I use bitcoin as a savings account. I can deal with risk, as I judge the potential return high enough to justify it. I don't cash out after a certain amount of gain, if so I would have sold everything long ago. I sell bitcoin when I decide to spend some of my savings on something I want. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:13:10
I see it as a lot of potential value that will most likely flow into bitcoin as most of the alts will fail to have staying power. There are not many that offer anything novel, and if it is just a cryptographic store of value that holders desire they will gravitate to the dominant implementation of the original blockchain.
The people shilling and cheering for alts remind me of those who bought into the hype and thought McGregor was going to beat Mayweather before and during the early rounds of their fight. Bitcoin is a vet, the original implementation of the invention of Nakamodo Consensus, implemented by Nakamodo himself. It was around long before most of these loudmouths and will still be standing when they are TKO.
There will always be some alts with value though, because some existing alts are interesting variations, and new ones will be created with new ideas. But mostly because people will always regret not getting in early on bitcoin, and will try to recreate the experience by diving into new projects, jealously trying to chase the dragon that they only ever experienced vicariously in the first place.

You have to accept that if you buy when the price has gone up 20x in a matter of months that there is a good chance it's gonna go part of the way back down. That's the risk you take for the chance to be in on the gains if it keeps going up.

I love I laugh with you but also at you. You guys have been so spectacularly wrong for so long. A lot of the excitement around bitcoin is uninformed hypebeast nonsense, which does deserve to be made fun of. 
Still, look at it this way: has been doing it's thing since early 2013, which is when bitcoin had a run up from $13 to $100+ (what a BUBBLE, am I right?). If at the beginning of the year they, instead of investing their time as ametuer comedians, had merely invested 10 weeks wages at an U.S. average hourly rate, those bitcoins would now be worth one million dollars. But hey, snark. Upload it to Buttbase and see what you can cash it in for.
 So I do get a chuckle when I see you guys still yammering about "bag holders". It's already been 5 years, and now you want 5 more? What are you going to say in 2023, that you need another extension, maybe 10 years that time around?

If not, then there is nothing new or interesting about it. If it can't be transferred and/or held off of Facebook then it will be nothing other than "store credit".  
If it is transferable for bitcoin it will be a giant boost for the bitcoin ecosystem.

The energy used is not based on the number of transactions. Miners essentially "bid" for bitcoins by making trillions of calculations, the more calculations they make the more chance they have to win a block reward (the reward is now 12.5 bitcoins, it cuts in half every 4 years). Since 12.5 bitcoins are currently worth close to $200,000 miners will use a huge amount of electricity in order to try to win the block reward.
The amount of power used is based on the value of bitcoin, not on number of transaction.
The reason bitcoins are valuable is that they are expensive to produce/acquire. It is this way by design.

Yes it is simpler to do with bitcoin but that just means that the stuff happening in other commodity markets is more sophisticated, not that it doesn't happen. And with regulatory capture there are all kinds of ways actors can manipulate and then leverage the laws in their favor.
None of this affects me much since I don't try to trade. I use bitcoin to buy things when it's portion of my total assets goes above my threshold, like it did in the recent run up. And buy a little at a time when the percent is low.

The origin story of bitcoin includes the invention of the mechanism that makes blockchains and digital scarcity possible. This gives bitcoin a degree of authenticity unmatchable by any other cryptocurrency. It is not all about level of adoption. Historically, iron and copper coins were more widely adopted than gold and silver, because they were more available than the rare metals. But gold and silver have always been more valuable and a better store of value, because their value is authentic, while the value of iron coins, which were minted by kings and merchants to facilitate more transactions than gold and silver could handle, was artificial and unreliable. 


There is only one original, and therefore completely authentic blockchain, and so fractions of this network have some degree of rarity, no matter how you slice it. That is why they have value. A single bitcoin is certainly valuable, single satoshis are of course not as valuable, being one hundred million times smaller.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:23:55
It would not get mined unless it did indeed have more value, in which case it would be a bargain at half the cost. The value and cost of production are in a virtuous cycle, a kind feedback loop.
In any case I never stated that the unforgeable costliness is *sufficient* for the value, but that it is *necessary*.

Continuously buy a little not to profit any time soon, but so that you have some in case it becomes widely used years from now, in which case the price will be way higher. If that happens, use it as needed, either directly or by cashing out to your favorite soft currency.

But here's the deal: I think it is reasonably possible to see $50-$100k within a few years. This makes the chance of it going down, even to $0, acceptable. Asymmetric risk ftw.

That's what most people don't get. They think it is all network effect and first mover advantage, so they use things like Yahoo being eclipsed by Google to try to understand the crypto ecosystem. What are talking about is something much deeper. Bitcoin is the [Schelling Point]( among cryptocurrencies due to it's origin story and longevity, the security and immutability buttress this strength. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:52:17
No, keep it if you can afford to. Who knows what will happen after the 2020 halving. The supply will really be getting squeezed then.

It is not inflation at all. To inflate you would need to inflate the total supply, not just create more divisibility in the current supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:05:11
What we are talking about is "granularity". Like how a bushel of grain has so many individual grains that it can be divided into any portions that are needed. There are about a million grains in a bushel. If you wanted smaller divisions you would have to ground the grains into smaller particles. That's what adding more granularity to bitcoin would be. It would only ever be needed if the value went up an extreme amount. If that were ever to happen there would be loads of new factors that came into play, things that no one today can even imagine.

@_date: 2017-12-23 06:55:04
It will usually work, and you can make a little extra this way. But here's the thing: 
Do you think bitcoin has the potential to go to $50k, or $100k, or higher? 
If not, then it is not worth the risk to keep or buy something that could lose so much value or that could fail altogether and go to zero. In that case you should sell it all and invest in something else.
And if you do think that it could go up a lot, then you are taking a big risk selling and trying to buy back lower. Because of we go to $50k or higher, it is likely to look like the rise to $100, and $1000, and $10,000. Meaning that at some point it is going to spike up hard, you are going to sell so that you can buy back lower, and then it is not ever going to go below your sell point again. So if you take the risk of trying to time the market like this you are very likely going to miss out on massive gains while trying to make much smaller profits. 
It's not worth it. If you are going to take the risks that come with investing in bitcoin, you should make sure that you are going to be rewarded if it does indeed go to the moon. If you don't think there is a good possibility it will, then it isn't worth the risk in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:54:39
It might not be a discount, it might still be way overpriced. People were spouting the same "discount" line in early 2014 when the price was $750, but if you waited a bit the same amount of money would have gotten you 3x as much. 
It could very easily drop below $5000 and not come back ever or for a long time. And it may never go below $10,000 again. 
Your statements make it obvious that you think you have some kind of special insight into what the price should be and what it will be in the future. Everyone but you knows that you have no such insight.

You want to generate the key pair on a secure offline computer to be safe, but you don't have to do anything special. Just send the coins to the address. You do want to triple check that it is the correct one. There are viruses that will change the public address in your clipboard, for example.

The deliberate, persistent deflation will tend to more than cancel out the 1% fee over time if you keep some money as BTC. And if you don't, 1% is not too bad of a fee considering the security benefits. 


You do not have to do it all yourself, there are third party sites like Blockchain.info with a much better security track record than Visa. But you **can** do it yourself with Bitcoin, if you want. That is the difference.
 


Yep. An update for the internet era over the forty year old stagnant  legacy system we are currently stuck with. Oh, and it includes a brilliant invention which, for the first time, allows the digital cash to be transferred with *zero counter party risk or interference even possible*.

Why would you want Bitcoin? At that point it is even more usable than now since you could easily change it for Amazoncoin, if you have one you have the other. There would be many reasons to buy it: to use at places that don't take Amazoncoin, to hold value and trade later, to speculate and trade, to buy Amazoncoin. 
The scenario you propose would quickly increase the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as well as the incentives to build even greater infrastructure. Most likely this would result in increased Bitcoin use and value, even if the new coin comes along and takes it's places alongside, or even ahead of, Bitcoin.

There is no "normal" to "return to". For all we know $300 or $400 is the "normal" price for 2014 and 2015, and we have been "returning to normal" all year.
I mean, I hope not, since I paid more than that, but we don't know what is going to happen. To many variables, too much depends on the future behavior of people who don't even know what they are going to do themselves.
Edit: I still might buy a little more on this drop though, in case this is the last chance to buy under $600. Like I said, you never know.

That would hurt the network, bitcoin is simply a protocol, which is an agreement to follow the rules. If enough people stop following the standards, then they become worthless, in the same manner than the concept of a minute would be useless if we couldn't generally agree on how many of them there are in an hour.
Something like this would be more likely to be used by a griefer to intentionally harm the network than by miners in order to collude on time-shifting the future bitcoins to the present.

Even if that is the more likely scenario: 1) There is no there other coin right now with even close to the amount of infrastructure, name recognition, percieved value, ect. 2) Even if that is the more likely scenario, even a small chance of Bitcoin becoming the dominant player makes $700btc a huge bargain because of the massive potential of the technology.

It might not be priced into the market because in a sense the market moves on perceived supply and a lot of people thought they had btc that did not. There might not be as much out there as people have thought.

You may or may not be able to prove it was stolen, same as if you left your bar of gold in your friends safe and he says someone came in and cracked the combination or forced him to open it . It is still theft though if it was taken intentionally. 
I agree that bitcoin in it's raw form is not a product for the masses. Right now it is a niche product for those who like the unmatched electronic fungibility that the invention of the blockchain has made possible. The thing is, even in this niche there is massive room for growth, and the programmatic and open source nature of the currency almost insures that overlay protocols will emerge that are more secure, universal, convenient, and far cheaper than anything available now, so it may just be a matter of time before every other person has bitcoins on his or her phone for convenience.
As far as not having consumer protections for your 10 cent transmission fee, well, it depends on how you look at it. I can't send a dollar with Visa without giving the recipient full access to my details and thus my account. Sure, if they steal my money I can probably get Visa to refund it eventually. But if I had used Bitcoin to send the dollar they would never have had my details to begin with. Thus the consumer protection in Bitcoin is built in rather than after the fact.

Bitcoin is protected from debasement by math and from confiscation by the fact that governments and banks don't have back end access to the funds. As long as we are asking people, ask the people of Greece how safe money in a bank account is.
The FDIC doesn't have anywhere near the funds to handle any large scale problem. Still, you will probably be OK in the US. But many other countries have ALREADY confiscated funds from people to fix grand scale financial fuck ups.

If your economic theory does not account for a new asset class which enables, through consensus rather than centralization, digital scarcity in a distributed system, it make not be applicable to blockchain based digital currency.
Bitcoin is already a working system. I bought a Chromebook with some of my Bitcoin yesterday, cheaper than possible without Bitcoin, and more secure too since I did it without giving out credit cards details. People get gold and silver delivered with bitcoin every day, faster than money orders or credit cards it looks like, since it is, again, more secure. 
Sure, overall Tigerdirect.com is tiny compared to Bestbuy, and Overstock is small potatoes compared to Amazon or Walmart, so Bitcoin is still tiny in the big picture. It could just be a "bubble", as you say, it's value could collapse. (the invention will still be around, but that's a different discussion than whether or not buying btc to hold is a good idea) Not all, but most people who invest in crypto-currencies realize this and are constantly on the lookout for new information with which to update their outlook.
Now I have to ask you, how much more penetration does Bitcoin need before *you* reevaluate the soundness of *your* economic theories? The ecosystem is small now, but what if Amazon does get on board? What if two or three years from now you can buy Bitcoin at Walmart and pay for cheeseburgers with it at McDonald's? Exactly how far from reality can your economic premises be before you consider them to be falsified or at least fallible?

Check out this deal: 
Tigerdirect is now winning the price war on some low margin, high demand items when the $20 discount for paying in Bitcoin is included. And they can afford to do it because of the savings in greatly reduced fees and the elimination of charge backs. 
I have been curious about how functional the new cheap tablets are. I am tempted to order this one now that it is available for &lt;$100 if paid for with Bitcoin. These new cheap devices are kind of a big deal because as the price drops due to technological advancement they become available to poor people in third world countries who can't afford any investment in technology more expensive than a low end steel bicycle or a cheap cell phone with no internet access. These new devices are going to change the modern world by providing these people access to it.

The tech bubble in 2001 was decades after the technology that made the internet possible was invented and integrated. People were online via modems in the early 1980's. By 2001 AOL and others were completely mainstream. That is just one of the reasons your comparison falls flat. 
The fact is, disruptive technologies come along from time to time and change the rules. Human history is full of examples going back thousands of years. You have presented nothing against the arguments in favor of the invention of the distributed asset ledger being the next in the long line of inventions. Your argument essentially boils down to: sometimes when people think a technology or a product is in the beginning stages of widespread adoption they are wrong, so in this case they are also wrong. You leave out the fact that sometimes they are right. The internet being the most recent example.

One mBTC is 100,000 Satoshis, or one [lakh]( Satoshi, and should thus be called the lakh.


The benefit of this is that we simply use the Satoshi as the unit, and an existing number system to name an intermediary denomination. People in many parts of the world are used to thinking of their native currencies in terms of lakhs, and it will be easy for others to adopt. And we don't have to do any readjusting later when one lakh Satoshi is worth as much as [one lakh Rupee]( (about $1600 for Indian Rupee).

I think there are a sizable number of old holders of Bitcoin who are taking this as an opportunity to buy goods directly with Bitcoin, bypassing the dollar. Those sales will tend to have a downward pressure on the price in the short term, as those btc get traded in for USD, but this process will make the overall system more mature and valuable in the long run. I don't mind if the price drops to $700 for a while, even though I paid more, if this essential part of the maturation process is the reason.

Well you can already buy a house for 100 BTC, just not a very nice one. 1000 satoshis for a house? I agree that is very unlikely.
The point is that the price of btc alone does not keep anyone out. It takes exactly one X-Box one worth of dollars or Bitcoins to buy an X-Box one at Tigerdirect.com or an ounce of gold's worth to buy an ounce of gold, which you can do right now with either dollars or Bitcoins. If you can do it with Litecoin or Tulipcoin in the future then it will take one x-Box worth of Tulipcoin to buy an x-Box and one ounce of gold worth to buy an ounce of gold.

Verified public bitcoin addresses tied to Google accounts of creators of original content, and optionally displayed in search results. Please.
Digital content with verified public addresses of it's creators included, searchable in various ways related to the address, ie highest amount received, with Google's anti search result gaming strategies applied as best as possible. Please.
Create a blockchain based smart property protocol for land ownership.  It would probably use ARC GIS or something similar. Facilitate claims on bounded areas of the virtual Earth's surface, limited by a self adjusting mix of socially beneficially Turing tests like the reCaptcha process, and small amounts of btc. A user could buy his or her way out of most of the Turing tests, which would subsidize the transaction cost of those spending nothing but their time. The digital representations of plots would have an upkeep that would simply be the cost of moving the coin in the associated address to a new address, this payment to the miners should be proportional to the amount of bytes added to the blockchain by the description of said property.

But if &gt;50% of nodes start colluding, even informally, to break even the soft rules then the value of bitcoin will suffer, and so generating more coins is not an incentive for this collusion.

You don't have to be a libertarian to understand the disruptive potential of new technologies. In this thread you are dancing around but not really addressing a very important issue: the economic theories who's axioms you keep repeating to us were formulated in an era when centralization was a technical requirement of any system that could store and transfer value at the speed and scale that the Bitcoin network does it. Thus, the theories have limited value. Anyone, whether they are a Bitcoin advocate or skeptic, who is certain that they know how this new innovation is going to affect the future is surely foolish and over their head.

The money in your bank account has more protections except for the most important ones, protections against being debased or confiscated.

If Bitcoins are successful enough that 100 buy mansion, then Litecoin and other alts will probably increase along side.

If they stole the coins then they committed theft. Call it "FunMoney" all you want, people buy gold bars with bitcoin, so it obviously has value.
The fact is, it is easy for third part services to steal coins and claim they were hacked, but that is a risk inherent in third party services that is not fundamental to bitcoin. Over time services will come and go and some relatively reliable ones will emerge from the chaos. Until then, giving someone else your bitcoin to hold is probably not a good idea unless it is someone you personally trust.

The only time that the rise made me desperate to get bitcoin was when I didn't have any in 2013 when I first learned about bitcoin. I read the whitepaper, and I took note of how smart bitcoin's proponents are, and I already had an idea of how forward looking the cypherpunk community was from knowing it's influence on computer science, early internet culture, and science fiction. I knew it was likely to retreat from $1000 back then due to how steep the run up was, but I wasn't sure and I wanted to get control of some in case it kept going up like mad.
Then over the next couple of years the price dropped down as far as $200, giving me the opportunity to get more. It took a bit of discipline to remind myself that the risk that it would keep diving was worth taking, because of the large open ended upside.
Now the way I look at it is that if the price goes crazy I will already have my modest little fraction of the 21*10⁶, so I don't need to add much to my bitcoin total as it is going up (I do round up a little when replacing what I spend). If it goes back down a bunch then I will increase the fraction a bit more. I couldn't resist buying a little when it went down to $800, but I won't be triggered into really loading up a bunch more unless the price tanks a lot harder than that.

The second part of my sentence, the one you didn't quote, negates what you are saying here. I said it was no longer arbitrary once coded it. It could have been 2.1 million or 210 million, but it was not, it was set, arbitrarily, at 21 million.

What I said is that it has structural similarities to a Ponzi. If new money does not come in to buy the new Bitcoins that miners are cashing in to pay their electricity bills, or if the demand for money from early adopters trying to cash out exceeds demand for Bitcoin by new users, the price will collapse. 
It is not a Ponzi, however.
It is quite clear to those of us who have bought Bitcoins that this is how it works, and we buy in anyway because we believe in the value of the protocol and it's tokens, and like the user experience. We know that if we cash out or spend Bitcoins at a place that cashes out, we are depending to a large degree on new users entering the market to prop up the value. In a Ponzi, new money keeps things afloat while maintaining the illusion that the payments are the result of some fictional characteristic of the brand.

The network still works just fine though, and in a lot of ways is superior technology to the system in general use, and superior tech tends to win out in the end.

It is better to use something with relevance outside of Bitcoin, rather than expecting people to learn a whole new scheme. And one coin being 10^8 atomic units is an arbitrary scheme that no longer makes any sense, regardless of what prefix is used.
And it would not be hard to switch at all because it makes more sense, if a sizable minority adopted this scheme, then the majority of new adopters would use it as well, since it so much more intuitive.

That was just wishful thinking. 
It may happen someday, and there was no way to know that this last run over $1k wasn't the time it went way higher and never looked back. 
Just hold on to what you have and forget about it, regularly add a little more over time, and you will be along for the ride if bitcoin ever really becomes to value what TCP/IP has become to information. If there is even a 1% chance of it going over $100k, which IMO there is, then it is worth risking $1000 per coin, even if all of the other 99% of scenarios are 0$/BTC, which obviously they are not. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:51:17
There is a decent chance that bitcoin will eventually go much higher than now. It might drop down lower than it is now first, but it just might be in the early phases of one of it's big jumps. If that is the case this will be the last time you will be able to get it at this price. So my advise is to spend what is to you a smallish amount of money on it now.
If you are someone for whom $1000 is just spending money then get at least a whole coin or two. If not get a fraction of a coin. If you have more money sitting around available to invest then get a lot more.
This is just insurance against missing out in case it does go up from here a bunch and never looks back like it did from $1, $10, and $100. 
Then, keep buying more a little at a time. If it does end up going down you will end up getting a lot more for your money, and if it goes up a bunch the small amount you buy now will end up being a significant amount. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:53:02

Huh? It sounds like for some reason you believe that fiat is the only kind of money or the ideal form of money, both of which are completely wrong. Fiat is the historical anomaly. 
Bitcoin is designed to be as close to ideal as possible. For something to qualify as money requires certain properties, namely durability, portability, divisibility, and fungibility. Bitcoin is the best money ever to be utilised in terms of the first three of those four qualities, and is proving to be fungible in practice as well.

I suggest continuing to buy over the long term at smaller intervals, something like $100 or so every week to every month. I started out buying a little the last time it was at $1000 three years ago, and have kept buying ever since. 
There is a decent chance that one of these times that it goes over $1000 it will keep going way higher and never come back, like it did when it went over $1, and over $10, and over $100. The extra couple hundred dollars (or five hundred if it goes to $500) that you paid for your coin was insurance to insure that, if this was the time that bitcoin was going to go astronomical, you wouldn't be left out of the run. Considering the true scarcity built into bitcoin, IMO that premium is well worth it. In retrospect it would have been better to save a little bit more fiat to buy in the future, but you had no way of knowing that this pullback was coming.

This is so dumb. 
Bitcoin is a newly invented form of money. Money is useful to humans because we can exchange it for things, namely things with value, things that are useful. Some of the useful and valuable things that bitcoin can be traded for are units of *other forms of money.* 
As long as there are other valuable forms of money, which will be as long as human civilisation lasts, bitcoin, should it continue to be viable, will be exchanged by those who use it for these other forms.
So do not tell me what to exchange my bitcoin for, nor when to exchange it. I will hold on to as much of it as I feel is in my self interest, for as long as I consider it to be in my interest. And I will exchange it with who I want, for what I want. Bitcoin is not a cult, nor is it a club, it is a new asset class with value, which can be utilized in new ways. I am not on your "team". 
Bitcoin is and will be held and used by people who have completely different reasons of doing so, it will be used by people who are enemies of each other.I hold and use it not to help "the community", but because it was brilliantly conceived, designed, and implemented with an incentive structure that motivates me to hold and use it. The same goes for anyone else with any sense at all.

No, to paraphrase Nick Szabo, the first asset class was the durable skeletal parts of our prey. It even seems that Neanderthals were using parts of rare birds of prey as a form of proto money. 
You are making the common mistake of using your experience to predict the future value of something that you don't have experience with. 
This isn't about first mover advantage or network effect. It is about game theory. There is a great deal of arbitrariness that goes into determining what humans use as ledgers to keep track of and store value, and this arbitrariness magnifies the cues that we are given and makes them determinative, absent other overwhelming considerations. 
There is a point in these discussion where metaphor simply breaks down, but I will try to join you in using them anyway. We still use "feet" and "meters" to measure things. These standards are thousands and hundreds of years old respectively. Why, when there are so many other systems that could be used? The reason is that it is mutually beneficial for humans to have shared systems of measurement. It does not often even matter much which ones we use, as long as we use the same ones to measure the same things. 
And the standard for measurement of value in this new era, an era ushered in by the invention of functional digital scarcity, is the *original* and thus the *authentic*, implementation of this invention.

Without a time machine another cryptocurrency can not match bitcoin's 2009 origin and resulting GOAT history of uptime.

This is consistent with the dominant view among economists, but it is wrong, or at least incomplete. It does not take into account how absolutely powerful proto money and then money was and is for humans, and the role it has played in our domination of the planet. A substance that is durable, fungible, granular, easily transportable, and unforgeably costly to produce or procure is useful to humans because it is able to act as a ledger, a counting system that allows us to cooperate to an amazingly unprecedented degree for vertebrates. There is nothing especially useful about the eagle claws that Neanderthals collected with what must have been great effort. Nor did early humans in Africa gain much utility from the beads that they spent hundreds of hours creating. Legacy economists will explain that these things were "adornments", but this doesn't explain why so much effort would be spent making and acquiring them. What explains this is that  the items were a form of proto money.

People usually talk about network effect, which is a good reason in of itself to expect bitcoin to be the cryptocurrency that succeeds.
But the underappreciated factor is that bitcoin is the obvious[ schelling point]( in the overall crypto world. 
To a large degree what we assign value to and what is therefore useful as money is arbitrary. And so bitcoin's identity as THE original blockchain makes it's token a more naturally instinctive and therefore more likely place for people to decide to store value. It is in a very real sense the one and only *authentic* crypto token, and the alts are the cubic zirconias to it's diamonds.
For the most part the altcoin phenomenon is the result of people witnessing the story of bitcoin and experiencing jealousy and regret for not hoarding coins at an earlier date, and comforting this regret by trying to duplicate the entire accomplishment and hoard a different token designed to appeal to just such a regretful mindset.

You misunderstand and severely underestimate the importance of bitcoin as the original implementation of Nakamodo Consensus when your comparison is companies and first mover advantage. Bitcoin is a protocol for measurement, like the  imperial system (which goes back thousands of years) and the metric system (which goes back hundreds of years). At the same time it is the original and most valuable implementation of a new asset class. In this way it is comparable to gold, which has been a valuable store of wealth since before writing was invented. Even when gold has been too rare to be utilized in daily transactions, and iron and copper coins were minted by trusted parties like kings and merchants, it still held it's value. There are all kinds of things that have been or could be used as money. It is a combination of game theory dynamics and the properties of the substance that determine what is preferred.

Considering that bitcoin's potential user base consists of anyone with internet access, and that it has powerful never before seen capabilities, the 10-100x scenarios do have real chances of playing out.

Bitcoin is not a company though. It is a protocol for storing, measuring, and exchanging value. So, this is not a matter of first mover advantage, as many people mistakenly believe. And it is not primarily a function of network effect either, although this is a necessary secondary and reinforcing factor. 
The importance of bitcoin being the original implementation of the invention that make cryptocurrencies possible is a matter of game theory more than anything else. Bitcoins represent the [Schelling Point]( for value storage among this new asset class (and possibly among all assets, to a degree, but if that ends up being true the world will change in ways we can not imagine).


Before bitcoin the idea of something being digital and scarce seemed like an impossible combination. How can something digital be scarce when it can easily be copied millions of times over? Satoshi's brilliant invention created a way for digital scarcity to be functionally implemented, by creating an immutable distributed ledger utilizing [public key cryptography]( where the tokens can be moved to new public adresses by the controller of the private key, but never duplicated.

I sure hope so, I need to buy back what I sold at $12.5k-$17.5k in order to invest in my business. $500 bitcoin will make that very easy. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:30:14
Like I said it is a mildly educated guess. 
It is based on my explanation of how bitcoin went over $1k and 2k and stayed there in the first place. That did not happen by everyday working class Redditors buying $100 here and there on Coinbase. 
The best explanation is that one or a few of the wealthiest people in the world started steadily accumulating some time ago. There are a handful of risk taking, technically accomplished people who could buy every last bitcoin available for $1000 each and still be seriously wealthy. And some of them have even made positive comments about bitcoin.
It is likely that they stopped accumulating at some point between $1500 and, $2k or $3k. At that point the momentum driven speculative mania took over. And they knew this was likely to happen. If it didn't happen then they could just keep on accumulating a higher and higher portion of all the coins. So if they thought bitcoin had a good chance of lots of future adoption and utility they were in a win-win scenario. It is a reasonable risk for someone like that to take when they would still have tens of billions or so, no matter what happened. 
That is how I estimate where the floor is. And I think it is likely to go down some more towards that floor because $7000 or $8000 bitcoin changes the calculations entirely (and they already have lots of coins from previous accumulation, so no need to follow the price up), and is a very high price to maintain with 12.5 new coins being mined every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:28:34
I buy it knowing I will probably (&gt;50%) lose money, but also know that I might (&gt;%10) get 10x returns. It's a more complicated decision matrix than that because there are many other possibilities, but the expected return is still positive, because of the nature of asymmetric risk. This was my thought process when I bought on the way down from $1000 to $200 in 2014-15, and it turned out to be a great investment. I still believe that the same principal applies today. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:47:03
It's not what they want, it's what they expect to happen. 
Even if I want the price to go up, if I expect it to go down I will tend to sell, and thus I will be a bear. (This is a simplification that doesn't take into account asymmetric risk/reward)

People do not live forever. I know that bitcoin is likely to keep going up over the years, but I spend some of it anyway. What good is saving money if you never spend it? When it rises and becomes a larger portion of my assets I use it to buy things. When it falls or stays low and becomes a lower portion of my assets I save it and/or buy more.

Share price? There are no shares of bitcoin. 
This is all speculation, no one knows for sure how much money it will take because no one knows when or for how much holders like me will sell.
We do know some factors, however, like the available supply from mining, the upper limit on the coins available now and that will ever be available, and roughly the available amount of money in the world and a rough idea of who has it. We also can make educated guesses about who has the proficiency to be able to understand the potential value of bitcoin, based on qualifications and experience. And we can get a rough idea of where demand has been highest based on trade volume and price differentials. During the run up from $500 to $2000 the price was consistently higher in the areas from where these people would have most likely been accumulating.

There is intrinsic value to ledger systems made up of substances/subunits with the following properties: divisibility, rarity/unforgeable costliness, fungibility, durability, and transportability. The value is a result of the system's potential to be used as money. [Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money by Nick Szabo](
The intrinsic value of the system gives intrinsic value to the tokens which give the system utility.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:31:24
I don't agree with you completely, but this is a very good post. Thank you.
Bitcoin was the first implementation of Nakamoto Consensus. This gives it an authenticity that is unmatched currently, and I don't foresee an obvious way that this is likely to change any time soon. This makes it the strongest store of value over the long haul. You points about developmental improvements are completely valid. But it is unlikely that any particular token will overtake bitcoin's top spot in terms of long term deflationary value storage. The ones with more transaction capacity but less security might possibly even facilitate more transactions, but in that case they will quite possibly become something like what iron coins were in the past: good for day to day use, but bad for storing or transacing large amounts. 


I think this became true during the run up somewhere between about $1500-$3k. I suspect that the run up to that point was cause by one or a few of the people on the world's richest 50 people list doing some serious accumulating. They likely decided it was a win-win situation, if the price would have stayed low they would have been able to accumulate a very large portion of available coins, and be in on any future mass adoption in a big way. Or alternatively, like has happened, they knew that the upward price pressure caused by their accumulation could spark a speculative mania that would decrease the amount of coins they could buy with the money they chose to commit but also make the coins they did manage to acquire worth far more than they paid for them.  Some of the folks on that richest person list are both very technically proficient and willing to take risks. Especially when they could risk and lose billions of dollars and still be among the richest people in the world.

Don't worry much about whether you are up or down day to day. I know it is hard not to notice. But it is better to just wait until you are waaaay up. So up that it is ridiculous to not spend a little here and there. The smart bet on bitcoin is to make sure you have some in case it every really becomes a real significant part of the global economic system, which is reasonably likely, but not certain. If it does, you will look back and $10k will seem like a pocket full of beans.

Bitcoin's authenticity is what sets it head and shoulders above other cryptos, USD and especially gold are even more authentic if we are talking about assets generally.
There is no way for a new asset class to bootstrap it's way from being worth pennies and then thousands of dollars and then who knows how much more without volatility along the way. 
Even gold is not all that stable, though it has been used for 9000 years. For many people like me the risk that comes with the volatility of bitcoin's price is worth it when weighed against the potential upside. There just are not all that many bitcoins, and there are very many potential users and use cases, and the supply is virtually completely inelastic, unlike gold, which is only inelastic in comparison to  manufactured goods or fiat currencies.
Unlike the Zimb or US dollar I can send a bitcoin to anyone anywhere in the world without the approval of various governments and financial institutions. That is very powerful technology.

Bitcoin is not a company, it is a protocol for storing and transferring value. Analogies therefore don't work that well in understanding or explaining it.

Yes, but 21 Inc also has to get practice building and supporting these devices, and they had to start somewhere. I would bet that in future versions the premium for the miner will come down. If it gets to be less than $50 more per device to be bitcoin enabled, and you get a tiny bit of that back over time in coin, these things could really take off. And if they do, being familiar with their operation from the beginning will end up being worth far more than $400 to a developer.

I'm not sure what all the drama is about, I just sent .5 BTC from Coinbase and it immediately showed up in my Mycelium wallet.

This is exactly the same sentiment that was common the first time it went over $1000. Before it went back to $200. Not much all has changed since 2016, other than an increase in demand relative to supply. And there is no way at all to know if that is temporary.
I am hopeful too, and am holding on to my coins. But I am also realistic, and I don't let euphoria get in the way of a reasonable skepticism regarding my own and other's thoughts about the future of bitcoin. 
I can tell you one thing for sure. I really hope that I never have an opportunity to say I told you so.

No, that is not how it works. Bitcoin transactions are created with a private key but the private key is not discoverable from the transaction, which in a wallet like Mycelium is produced client side.

So much potential here.
Here's one for you: 
User pays $50 in bitcoin for a mini quad copter with HD cam, set up in an interesting location. User flies quad remotely. If quad is returned to it's station the user gets most of the $50 returned.
A few years and this could evolve. Imagine anti poaching surveillance drones, deployed to protect elephants, that are piloted by people who fund them in real time. That is some very direct feedback on one's investment.

Quadrocopters with hd cameras are as cheap as $50 and getting cheaper.


Yes batteries. Make the cost high enough to cover a new one every 10 or 20 flights. Electricity cost is negligible.


Surveillance. Read. Crowd-sourcing both the monetary and mechanical Turk requirements of the surveillance from the same person, who is motivated to provide funds by getting to participate directly, all while having a shot at making a great safari adventure video. Find poachers, alert local good guys to intervene, likely the conservationists who set up the system.

Buy some to make sure you have some, in case it never is lower than it is right now, which is possible. Save some money to buy more if it goes down some, which is more likely.
Remember that the last time it crossed $500 there were people that waited for it to go down before buying in for the first time, and many of them never got in. Same goes for $1000 and $2000, and the same might happen at $3000.

First you challenged me to pick any time period where you lost half your purchasing power, which is very easy, then you limited it to ten years, and I pointed out that you have lost half of your ability to purchase gasoline, precious metals, and wheat, which were the first four things I looked up. I also happen to know that you have lost more than half of your purchasing power in that time frame, in terms of farmland.

All my searches have turned up are the same little blurb in the help file of multibit telling me to search for ~~wallet.dat~~ multibit.wallet, the default wallet, but it is nowhere to be found. I made a second wallet and opened and closed and it is still there and the ~~.dat~~ .wallet file is still there. I don't think the wallet was hacked because the .25btc is still there.

Bitcoins might never really be a secure way to keep money because, while the protocol is secure, there is no way to use a wallet without the private code existing on an internet connected device. There might always be as much incentive to steal passes by whatever means than there is to create secure clients without back doors.

What cracks me up is when people say that everyone will be afraid to use it because of the volatility.

I bought some at 1000 not because I thought it was going to keep rising but because I thought it *could* keep rising and I did not want to be the idiot who realized the potential and got left out while trying to predict when the price was going to fall. Think of the premium as one for insurance.
Then when it started to fall I bought some more. And when it fell more, I bought more, now I have more than 2 BTC, and I paid an average of $830 for it.
When it fell to $500 I did not sweat it for one second, I just sat back and watched the drama, breathing easy. I knew the only way the volotility was going to fuck me was if I freaked out and sold, and there was no way I was going to do that. I want more Bitcoin not less! (I have a goal of trying to acquire 12.5 BTC before the price rises out of the range where I can afford to buy hundreds of mBTC at once. That would give me 1/1,000,000 of the bitcoins in existence.)
And you know what? As of right not the price is back to $740. So I would lose 10% if I were to spend it right now.
In practical terms that is no different than what happens to people all the time with USD and other currencies. I don't know if you have noticed but with the USD you can look away for a mere moment and lose 10% of your ability to purchase food or fuel.

Stealing requires intent to permanently deprive someone of their property, which you **obviously** did not have, since the first thing you did was post a public offer to return the property to the rightful owner, on a forum that the owner was known to frequent. **This is not stealing**, it is the same as coming home to find your neighbor's kid left his bike in the street and putting it in your garage until he comes home, in order to keep it from getting stolen or ran over.
You should **demand a retraction** from Business Insider, Bloomberg, and any other news source that slanders you. Do not let them get away with this.

Anyone who didn't think Bitcoin could fall after going so high so fast is an idiot.
I only heard about Bitcoin during the $800-$1200 run up and I bought some knowing it was likely to fall. In fact my gut told me that $400 was the likely floor.
I bought some anyway because I did not want to miss out on a chance to own Bitcoin while waiting for it to go back down. Even if it was likely to go down I was not sure that it wasn't going to keep rising to, say, $2500, and then "crash" back to $1500, never going under $1000 again. So I bought at inflated prices as insurance against this possibility, even though I considered it unlikely, because of the large possible long term upside that I realized existed after reading about the Bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:15:05

The banks get away with skimming, but if money straight up disappears into the ether out of an account there are people to go find and yell at.
I think what will ultimately drive bitcoin is the utility, in the medium term anyway. People will consider it risky but will be willing to risk a little spending money because of the cool things you will be able to do with it. That still leaves a lot of room for growth, just not to x1000 levels.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:08:19

What you do not understand is that bitcoin is an API for programmable cash as much as it is a network or a currency.

Even if someone is hoarding a bunch as it climbs in price, they are going to shave off a few thousand Satoshis to buy something that they previously could not afford, or to purchase a product or experience that was made possible by the bitcoin ecosystem.

Bandwidth was limited in the early days of the internet so if someone was camping on 1/10th of the packets it would have hurt everyone's performance. Bitcoin's price does not effect it's usefulness for new adopters.
There is a decent chance that Bitcoin will be widely used in the future, in which case it could very possibly be worth many times more than it is today. Everything that made Bitcoin go from 1 to 1000 is scale-able upward 10x or 100x more, as far as we know. With those realistic upside potentials the large risks that Bitcoin could go down drastically are worthwhile at this early stage.

Mobile networks that are or will soon be capable of handling transactions via SMS cover almost all of the populated areas in the regions where the 1.5 billion people live who use lakh to mean 100,000. It is the only widespread common language shorthand for 100,000 that I know of. Same for 10,000,000= Crore= 1/10 BTC.
Having these shorthand names would immediately place things in terms many people with inflationary currencies understand, not just in South Asia. People are already used to working in those large numbers. And in S. Asia it would have the opposite effect of OMG one coin=$1000. If bitcoin kept going and went 10x higher people there would still be thinking they could load up on one lakh BTC for $10 or about 500 rupees, for example.
And having one form or convention does not mean the other isn't used. mBTC just does not sound like a good folk name for a unit of currency, in the way that one BTC is a full "coin", especially since there is already one for 10^5 and 10^7 in a language spoken by a billion people who also speak English. 
Also, many people in Africa and East Asia are familiar with this terminology. 
10^5 Satoshis = one lakh Bitcoin
10^7 Satoshis = one crore Bitcoin

Bitcoins are valuable. If you don't agree, do not own them. If you do agree, then only trade them for other valuable things. Do not fool yourself into thinking that your day to day guesses about what the market is going to do are valuable. They are not. You can not predict who is going to decide to load up on btc later today, or who is going to unload their new riches and buy something.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:35:46
There is incentive to use it, or else it never would have grown in value at all. The incentive to use it is that it works so well. It is going to be able to do more and more as the ecosystem evolves. This is not an assumption. There are thousands of people working on implementing these capabilities right now, and there will be more and more people doing so all the time and for years to come.
Also, people will not just keep hoarding as the price climbs, they will cash in and enjoy their returns. Especially if there is volatility and risk in the market. Just look at Las Vegas. People enjoy risk and volatility! 
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:58:32
Humans are the same, but this situation is different than anything else in history.
Bitcoin is a distributed global asset ledger with very low cost to use.
It disrupts the fashion in which human emotions will drive market trends. It's not that they won't continue to do so, it's that Bitcoin was designed to take them into account and utilize the force to suck a large part of the global economy into itself. It changes the rules, and so there will be different trends, and you will need new conceptual tools.

If you already have Bitcoins, Gyft works great. But it is not a motivation for people with fiat to buy Bitcoins, since they can more easily buy the goods directly with fiat.

I have the version that Armory prompted me to install. This is the first time I have ever used Bitcoin-qt, and likely the last. There are only so many days a reasonable person can invest in something like this before cutting losses and moving on to something more productive. And even if I were to get it to work, the fact that it is this complicated to actually control your own Bitcoin severely limits the utility of the network, and thus caps the true current value of btc at a low level.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:06:25
The same controls can exist if he tries to put it in a bank, but the same controls can not exist for Bitcoin because they are impossible, is there is no central authority to appeal to.
But if the addresses of people who fund terrorists are known, their transactions can be watched and if suddenly someone is spending the Bitcoins in America they could possibly be tracked and investigated.
It is a real issue, but it is unavoidable that a transformative technology will also have a transformative effect on crime.

You may think I know it all, but as you can see from my post I did not follow my gut feeling, I used tried and true buy and hold, with a little dollar cost averaging thrown in, because I think that Bitcoin is a good long term investment, albeit risky. The people who think they know it all are the ones day trading and freaking out.

Bitcoin to Houston: Inventions don't get uninvented.
The Bitcoin protocol has proven itself to the point of holding billions in value and transmitting millions daily. The concept is proven.
At this point in it's trajectory claiming with certainty that Bitcoin is not going to the moon is as presumptuous and ignorant as saying that you are sure that it is.

Multibit deleted my wallet, i'd say it is a scam.

People will play with risk they think they understand. This is why I think the price volatility arguments against bitcoin are faulty.
But people aren't going to buy into something when they do not understand all of these convoluted mechanisms that are needed to secure it.

There is a good chance you will lose it to an accident or a hacker. The bitcoin ecosystem is fragile as fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:03:52
Certainly a possibility! Cheers.

AJE is biased as shit. Ask a Shiite from Bahrain.

Not me, not if the underlying protocol remains.

It is worth the trouble now to get Bitcoin since you can get **one lahk satoshi** for only about 75 rupees.
Seriously, we need to use lahk for mBTC! Tell this sub Andrew, tell them how there is already a word for 100,000 in common usage!

The next big milestone is one oz of gold.
$1029 for Bitcoin right now. $1245.72 for gold.

Again, this does not help security since any money you put on that card will be able to be stolen by the card company's tech guys with no consequences or recourse.

I did not make a backup because this was my "cash" wallet. I only put in $1 at first and that seemed to work fine, then $50, only then did I put in .2 BTC. Multibit was promoted as one of the safer and more well regarded clients, I expected it to work consistently and not just randomly delete the wallet file from my computer. I am sure that is what happened because the BTC has not moved and it has been several days: 
I assume that it would have been moved right away if it was something malicious. 
Sure I failed in making a backup, but Multibit also failed, and it is a big part of the ecosystem.

Of course they do, since that is what most people in the world use.

high risk/high reward baby. You didn't think you had a chance of 10X returns without a chance of losing it all, did you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:57:39
That has been one of the uses up until now, but the excitement about the future is bitcoin as programmable cash. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:38:06
funny how I do not need a whole new device to use my bank account or ebay right now.
Bitcoin needs special protection like a fragile kid who is allergic to everything and is always sick.

Finally got it going by deleting the DB and re-installing. Thanks.

Also, you have to be approved to even post there:

Note that Stross didn't predict that Bitcoin *would* die in a fire.

Now you are getting desperate. Your comparison does not work. Bloomberg mistakenly showed the private code. One of two things were going to happen. Someone was going to take the Bitcoin and keep it, or someone was going to take it and give it back. The owner got lucky and a good Samaritan came along before a thief.
You sound like one of the types of people that would sit at a broken stoplight all night if it was stuck on red.
