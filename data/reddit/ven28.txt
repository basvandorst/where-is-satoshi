It is a big deal. 
I see no real sense for Chase to do this: Cash deposit is the only really reliable way to get money transferred immediately to another person that you can't meet face-to-face (and **it's free**). The $10,000 threshold is there for something, anything larger than that being deposited into the same person's accounts would trigger alarms, and no serious money laundering criminal would get involved into the logistical nightmare of laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars by such small transactions.
Let's see how other banks react...
By the way, this was announced a few weeks ago:

No. Look at forex, for example: $5.3 TRILLION are traded on any average day. This number was around $3 trillion only a few years ago, and currencies are not more stable nor volatile than before.
The thing is that Bitcoin prices are decided on the last trade that happened on a given exchange. In moments of low volume (low liquidity, low depth) a few bitcoins can move the price much more than in situations of more volume (more liquidity, more depth). You can see that there are many markets (derivates, for example) that use the *weighted average* to avoid this.

But why wouldn't I just switch to USD to protect myself from inflation, a currency with much lower volatility than BTC? (Honest question, Venezuelan myself).

Yes, mainly because that's what the government gives us, USD. A BsF/BTC trade makes nearly no sense.
Also, you won't go to jail if they catch you negotiating in the black market, no one will catch you because no one is looking.

If you work with Venezuelans, you know they are not getting paid $3, which is where your 5 million people figure comes from in the first place.
People, and mostly merchants, sell most if not all of their BTC: One part in Bolívares, other part in USD.

Because I think it is not supposed to add up the way you are portraying it. 
Some more context here: it is near impossible to get a USD account in the country without traveling (which is restrictive because of the passport situation). Also, many Venezuelans are now taking freelance jobs from the US, Europe, etc to earn living wages. Those jobs pay in foreign currency, so these freelancers are turning to Bitcoin to be able to use that money in Venezuela.
Many merchants are also accepting Bitcoin. This is a solution for the large chunk of the population that doesn’t have Zelle.
Bitcoin is also a solution for those living abroad to send money to their families back home.
So, many actors involved here beyond the population only earning USD $3 a month...

I've actually being thinking the same the last few days, and I support your idea of holding the BitCoin from the *issuer*: this shouldn't be a problem since they are getting immediate cash by selling the option, they are getting paid for giving away the right to use that asset for a certain period of time.


Remember that you only do that when you expect the market to go *a bit* down, because the profit expected by the issuer of the Call is limited to the prime paid by the buyer (while the loss is theoretically limitless). If you expect the market to fall, you buy Puts on the asset or sell it, since the fall might be farther than your limited profit from the Call option.
I either have not resolved how could Put options be implemented, but I would love to have an Options market for bitcoin.

This is the most logical one and also saves you a good few $ on transaction fees, which are usually high for international wire transfers.

Yup, thanks for explaining it better than I could.
For example, *more than 64% of Canadians pay their credit card balance in full each month, the interest rate for two-thirds of credit card users is zero.* [Source]( That's the good personal finance management I was referring to.

Yup, if you order on Friday-Monday you'd get the BitCoins by the next Friday with Coinbase. 5 business days.

On what reasoning do you think this might happen? Given that the supply is limited (only a certain number of bitcoins will ever exist, with no *monetary policy adjustments* possible), the price for BitCoins will keep going up as more people want to use it and go buying, increasing demand.
I actually don't know *what* economic or social force would actually stabilize BitCoins: Government regulation? A technology barrier? The more countries develop (think Latin America, Asia, Africa, etc), the more people will be able to use BitCoins and keep the pressure up...
Also, I wouldn't say BitCoin has suffered from *bubbles*, given that it has recovered pretty fast from this "crashes" people actually believe BitCoins are worth more. Assets are valued from its intrinsic value and on future value, that future value is what's pushing BitCoin, I believe: its potential growth and its establishment as an accepted currency.

Well, it gives you *credit*. 
Its nothing more than a small instantaneous high-interest loan: if you manage your finances well it's a great instrument to use IMHO. Unfortunately, most people fail at the first part...

Theft? You just described the basic monetary policy of every country on Earth! The money multiplier is decided by the central bank on the basis of how much money they want in the economy, which in turn is based on the central bank's reserves, If you want an extra 1MM you only put a fraction of it and banks will multiply it.
In practice, those who received the loans will spend it to buy products and services, not let it sit in cash at a bank (otherwise the interest would eat it up) and people will get paid and then also consume more products and services than before... **that's how economic growth happens.**
If the central bank didn't put that money on the street the currency would overvalue and terribly hurt the economy.


1. Most economies are stable enough for this not to be a risk
2. Basilea III already establishes a great number of ratios banks must follow to maintain reasonable liquidity, capital, and exposure to financial risks. The financial crisis in 2008 happened thanks to financial institutions that violated the rules on asset-pricing.
You may hate how some players have cheated the system, but it's simply moronic to call fractional-reserve banking *theft*. I'm sure any nearby community college to you will have an *Introduction to Macroeconomics* class that will explain it better.
