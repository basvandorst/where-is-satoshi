Sorry, not sure exactly where it is or how to do that.  But took a look at my notes, looks like the quote is in the first third or so of the video.  If you've gotten to deflation/security you've gone too far.

Where does the name 'Factom' come from?

But wait! U missed it. 
US attorney refers to Bitcoin as a currency. Twice. 
A bit of a departure from the US stance to date of treating bitcoin as a quasi commodity. 
But then again, I guess the US government gets to change its classification when it's convenient for them. 
I don't anticipate Bitcoin to ever fall squarely in one category or the other.

Really cool stuff, wondering if we could dive into the cointegration of these factors to determine where the causation coming from. For example - this paper studies the cointegration of bitcoin, gold, and floating fiat exchange rates:    
Here's some info on cointegration (the math is a bit beyond me but I think I get the concept: 
It determines that floating fiat exchange rates lead to volatility in the price of gold which then leads to volatility in the price of Bitcoin.
So it's as if there is one really big dog (fiat exchange rates) pulling around a smaller dog (gold) pulling around a drunk (bitcoin). 
At first glance it sort of looks like transaction volume is leading exchange volume. 
If we could prove that and then we could prove that exchange volume is leading price we could be onto something interesting.

Its pretty simple. 
You haven't missed the boat - but you are on the wrong dock. 
People call me an idiot for investing in alt coins (doge, nxt, ppc, earth...) At least one of which will increase many orders of magnitude in the coming years. 
People will call me an idiot when I invest in the new wave of alt coins that have yet to even be created. 
Soon - you'll be calling me "lucky"
Downvote away suckas :)

Factom will implement its own token.  Mastercoin and Counterparty cannot clear transactions fast enough to drive the protocol long term.
There is a chance that we may use a Mastercoin token as a stop gap measure.  But we will run Factoids on their own chain in Factom.
We are interested in exploring if Counterparty or Mastercoin might want to try and run their protocol on a Factom chain... That might be interesting, transactions that take seconds rather than several Bitcoin confirmations, and no more arguments with Bitcoin devs.

Yeah, I'm not a heavy user and neither is my friend.  But that's the crux of the issue isn't it?  Just another needless hurdle that we won't have to jump in the future...

Good quotes from Andreas Antonopoulos (
"Napster suffered a fatal flaw - centralized network controlled by a centralized organization, which was a registered corporation.  It got sued to hell. 
Kazaa centralized corporation, centralized software, decentralized network.  It got sued to hell.  
Bit torrent - decentralized corporation, software, network.  Had to go after individuals.  
It was an evolutionary processes whereby the government attacked peer to peer systems and helped them to evolve into a fitness function of surviving government attacks.  The government cultivated bittorrent and made it an absolutely unstoppable network protocol."
And we took those lessons and created bitcoin.  The world will never be the same!

The author in the post above shares the same falty premises as all alt bears - he assume that Bitcoin has been crowned the winner now and for forever.  
The fact is - we are in the absolute infancy of the digital currency movement, for all we know the person who develops the 'gold' of digital currencies hasn't even been born yet.  
The world we live in can switch standards faster than ever.  Granted, global financial instruments are much more complicated than social media networks, but there is a non-zero chance that BitCoin could go the way of MySpace if a strictly better digital currency is created (and I'd argue a small number already have been) or friendster should there be a Bitcoin technical issue.  
If you're in agreement that the world will be a better place with digital currencies, how could you argue against having multiple?  Alts provide breeding grounds for innovation, a security blanket if things go poorly (or governments try and intervene), and a means of accountability for the BitCoin creators and community.  
After all, the only way users have power is through choice.
