Wealth inequality is not caused by government and taxation but by heads of private corporations monopolizing the gains from improved efficiency caused by technological progress. Just look at the charts of GDP per capita (or per employee) in past few decades. You'll notice steep growth. Now compare it to median wage adjusted for inflation. You'll notice stagnation or even decline. The fruits of this improved productivity are collected by the top 1%.

I'm not arguing that bitcoin is cash. It has different properties, it can be more secure in some ways (multisig, brain wallets) it can be also less secure for some people (virus infected computers, no deposit insurance, no chargebacks... yet).
I have an issue with your 'violence backed' term. What does it even mean? The value of fiat is certainly not violence backed (see various hyperinflation events in history). I presumed that you wanted to say that fiat savings are protected by government while bitcoin is not (which is not true, government will try to help you even if your bitcoins are stolen) but maybe by "violence backed" you meant that you are forced to pay your taxes in fiat and accept fiat as payment in your shop?

Yes but with 2000 transactions per second, that's 2000×60×60×24×356 = 61516800000 transactions per year. With 0.0065 USD transaction fee, that's 399859200 dollars for miners to buy their hard drives and network bandwidth. 3 TB western digital hardrive costs $120. For $399859200 you can buy 3332160 of them, plenty to store the 92 TB of blockcahin data.

You mean why are people working for corporations under those circumstances? Because they have no other choice. The bargaining power of employer VS employee is asymmetric. Without unions the employees are forced to compete for jobs among themselves. Also with technological progress lots of positions for unqualified workforce is disappearing and not everybody is intelligent enough to graduate from college/university. Free market won't solve those problems. Yes, there is charity, but it is IMO generally just a band-aid for the bad consciousness of the rich. It is free market solution for problems caused by free market/capitalism itself. We need more than that. Watch for example Perverse guide to ideology by Slavoj Zizek if you are interested in alternative views on current social and economic problems.

Note that i understand their situation but they will not make their living by NOT releasing the movie or by releasing it year after filming when it is already outdated.
And i'm ignoring the fact that the movie will be pirated and put on torrent sites immediately after release on the platform of their choosing.
The whole problem is of course caused by copyright law or absence of better system/regulation which would ensure money for creators without artificial limits on distribution.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:23:35


Crowdfunding is IMO only part of the solution. Without additional regulation, you have the same problem as without any copyright regulation at all. Everybody would be just waiting for other people to fund the project and then get if for free once it is finished.
I think that the best solution would be to replace copyright with another kind of regulation - make it mandatory for people to spend part of their income on intelectual property. They could decide what to fund but they would have to fund something. Than, you could have the resulting works in public domain, everybody could use them as they wish and creators would have their money. Much better than copyright if you ask me.

I'm on this subredit and i'm not agains smart regulations. Of course i'm against dumb regulations.
There are many people on this subredit, some of them spread misconceptions about bitcoin such as:
- bitcoin is not regulated
False. There is no law which would extemp bitcoin or other cryptocurencies from existing regulations. Maybe it is not clear how is bitcoin regulated in various countries (as commodity or as currency) but it certainly is regulated like anything else you'd like to trade. Some exchanges were already shut down for lack of compliance with existing laws.
- bitcoin is annonymous
False. Bitcoin is tracable, there are no provisions in the bitcoin whitepaper/protocol specifically put in for the user annonymity
- bitcoin will replace government
False, how would that even be possible? Bitcoin cannot build roads or schools.
The main reason bitcoin was created is to have currency/store of value without central authority (which could control creation or destruction of new units) and payment network available anywhere in the world. Most of the regulations which prevent scams and thefts in legacy banking industry are desireable also for bitcoin and will come to it eventualy as it matures.
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:34:21
How exactly would bitcoin help with money-state separation? If government institutions adopted bitcoin it would make them more transparent but i don't see how bitcoin would prevent corporations from buying laws from politicians with bribes. On the contrary the pseudo anonymous nature of bitcoin would make bribes easier to hide and harder to trace.

That is no bitcoin-specific problem. There are many ways to avoid paying taxes and i'd argue that using bitcoin is not even the best one.
I agree that civilized society needs to collect taxes and we should reform tax law in such way that it would be hard or imposible to avoid paying them. For example don't tax income which is easy to hide. Tax property/land which is always registered to someone and so it is always clear who should pay for it.

This is quite important. We need to ask the right questions first before we can try to come up with correct answers. 
For lots of people it seems to be impossible to even think about some change to our capitalist system with its untouchable private property rights. Communism was discredited by soviet era. After cold war no one could speak about it as an alternative without being ridiculed. Francis Fukuyama wrote about this in his 'end of history' book. 
The value of occupy wall street movement is not about any answers or about political unity of its participants, it lies in the fact that we are finaly starting to ask questions what is wrong with our current system, what is wrong with distribution of wealth and power. What went wrong with the communism experiment (in theory, it sounds like nice idea) and can we learn from it? And how we can fix current situation?

What other option did he have? Report it to police and go to jail for several decades? Why is it bad to protect yourself from person who is extorting you?

Personally i don't understand this change. It kills colored coins which use one satoshi outputs with appropriate fee unless you send them directly to mining pool which accepts them (and by doing so, you lose the decentralisation advantage of bitcoin). 
Why is the transaction fee itself not enough to combat spam transactions? With this patch, one satoshi transaction with 1 bitcoin fee would be seen as dust and not relayed by default client. This is IMO wrong. The indication of the importance of the transaction and the resulting incentive for the miners to include it in the blockchain should be the transaction fee and not some arbitrary number in default client. In other words, small output transaction Gavin see as spam could be important for other people so much that they would be willing to pay high fees to get them into blockchain. It is not OK for Gavin to restrict them in doing so.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:02:50

It is IMO correct to say that bitcoins are backed up by the processing power. Your desirable monetary properties are only possible with the proof of work blockchain constantly computed and verified by the processing power of the network. Without it, the bitcoins value would disappear as you would be unable to securely keep, spend or receive them or mine them. Sure, you wouldn't get any spent processing power back for your bitcoins but this is afaik not the only meaning the words "backed up" could have in English.
@_date: 2013-07-16 14:58:45
For me, the overhelming evidence that anarchy (no government) is worse then some government is that there is currently no place on earth which would function well and long-term with no government at all.
Also it's clear that if there is no place without government (because it probably doesn't work wery well) there are no crimes caused by this non-existent system. But it doesn't mean that no government is better.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:29:57


I suggest that transactions are dropped or processed/relayed based on transaction fee (and possibly other parameters like coin age, transaction size and value) and not size of the outputs only. This way, it could be still possible to send one satoshi ouputs if high enough fee is used.

How not? Imagine you have large sum of dirty bitcoins you stole from someone. To clean them is currently quite simple - just use some of the numerous mixin services available. At the end, you end up with clean bitcoins.
I can understand the motivation behing AML laws. When someones lifesavings are stolen from his bank account, he is not very happy when the bank tells him it doesn't know where were the money transfered because the transaction was anonymous. If this happens to large amount of people they will push politics to accept some kind of AML laws which would protect them from such situation.

It is an issue for existing projects. You cannot change the value of your color coins easily. You would need to start new project.

It is different. One of the purpose of bitcoin is the store of value. Purchasing and holding (not speculating on the price and selling high!) bitcoins is very much in line with its intended purpose. It doesn't make the currency unusable for the others, rather it makes it more valuable for everyone.
On the other hand,  squatting domains without using them in any meaningfull way is in direct conflict with the purpose of namecoin or any other domain registration system. It makes the system unusable for normal users (all of the common domains are already taken by squaters). If you want to help namecoin grow, you can just hold namecoins. No need to register and block domain names.

Money laundering can have real victims. Let me give you simple example:

Person A reports the theft to police which tracks the money to the money launderer - person C.
If person C has not laundered the money, police could track them and return them to person A. But by enabling money laundering, person C effectively helped person B to steal the money from person A. This is hardly victimless crime.

OK, no upvote for you, this is my version of text i sent them:
To: donate
Subject: donations for wikipedia in bitcoins
i see there is another donation drive for wikipedia going on and bitcoins are still not accepted. That is
very sad because the other payment options are inferior and i refuse to use them for security/moral
- paying with credit card requires me to give credit card number and personal details to any web site i
want to pay to. It's only a matter of time before the site is compromised and my personal details abused.
- using paypal is out of question. This company shuts down its customer accounts based on ideological
reasons. In the past they terminated services and froze funds to p2p tracker sites, wikileaks, bitcoin
businesses etc.
- Amazon payments also require me to hand out my credit card number and other personal details to U.S.
based company which would surely have no issue to provide them to U.S. authorities on request (or even
without request in the light of the recent Snowden leaks).
Bitcoin on the other hand has no disadvantages listed above. It's digital currency which anyone in the
world connected to the internet can use. There is no need to give any personal information or pay high
fees to payment processors. Accepting bitcoins is also easy. Just install bitcoin client and provide
bitcoin address on your donation page. You can also sign up with service like bitpay ( 
) which will for small fee automaticaly process bitcoin payments for you and convert them to dollars or
other fiat currency of your choice.
If you are realy concerned aboud funding wikipedia and have a real need for as many donations as possible
i urge you to accept bitcoins payments as soon as possible.

Yes but what about small amount of microtransactions? Like one? Why would i be prevented from sending single small transaction regardless of the fee in next version of client?

Why not? I  would gladly generate restricted address for my saving account, from which withdrawals would take significant ammount of time.


Maybe there is no cryptographical way but there could be other posibilities.
For example with delay, the attacker cannot launder his stolen bitcoins immediately after the theft. This gives you time to report the crime to authorities, get confirmation from them and label the bitcoins as stolen in some central public database. Then legit clients could be modified to not accept or relay bitcoins marked as stolen, which would greatly decrease the incentive to steal them in the first place.

How are speculators helping with liquidity? Without speculators, there would be legit buyers, who don't plan to game the market for they own gain by selling the bitcoins later for higher price, but instead want to keep their value in the bitcoin economy.
Speculators could pose huge danger for the stability of the market. If one of them decides to cash out their large amount of bitcoins, they could begin a panic sell which would drasticaly lower the exchange rate and make everyone savings less valuable.
Also speculators don't "always" provide liquidity. They provide liquidity only when it suits them. Try selling some of your bitcoins to speculator for recent price whet the bubble is bursting and the exchange rate is on the ride down. I think none of the speculators would be willing to buy from you then.

Colord coins exploit the fact that every bitcoin amount has a public history of transactions stored in blockchain so any coin can be traced to its origin.
Some well known public entity can take some of the bitcoins in its possesion and claim that they now have some colour, let's say blue. The entity can now issue very small amount of those blue coins (units of satoshis or whatever the underlaying protocol allows as minimal transaction) to its customers and promise some services or goods for them.
The coloured coins can be traded securely and in distributed manner just like normal bitcoins.
Thats basicaly it. The concept can be used for applcations like stock exchanges etc.

For example flavoured cigarettes are banned in some parts of EU. They say that flavoured cigarettes are entry point to smoking for young people, so they banned them. Anecdote: former german chancellor stashed himself with hundrets of mentholl cigarettes packs fearing they could be banned in germany: 
If you ask me, it's the same bullshit like banning other drugs. Represion costs us much more money and wasted human lives (jailed people, people killed by poor or too pure quality of the street drug) then legalisation. I'm not even mentioning that it should be human right to do whatever one wants if this behavior is not dangerous to the rest of the society. 
Instead of represion, we need to focus our money and efforts into educating kids about real effects and dangers of various drugs and addiction to various things in general.
This quote from the DP Roberts pleased me very much: "We have an important message, and the time is ripe for the world to hear it,” says Roberts. “What we’re doing isn’t about scoring drugs or ‘sticking it to the man.’ It’s about standing up for our rights as human beings and refusing to submit when we’ve done no wrong.”

At some point, yes. Otherwise, you would starve before the rent-paying time comes up.
In my opinion, deflationary economy is better then inflationary one. 
Inflation supports wasting. Money in your bank account are losing value constantly, so you want to spend them as soon as possible even for stuff you don't quite need.
Deflation on the other hand supports saving. You would still buy stuff you need, because well... you need it, but not more. It is IMO more stable and responsible way of managing your finances, it gives you more freedom. 
Is it bad for economy? I'm not sure but i don't think so. The current inflationary model depends on continuous grow which is IMO more dangerous in the long term.

Transaction value is IMO not enough to determine propper priority. Imagine 0.5BTC transaction with standard 0.0001 fee and smaller 0.1BTC transaction with large 0.5 fee. Which is more important?
The propper way to determine transaction priority (which should be used by miners to include it into the next block and by clients to relay it over the network) should be based on transaction fee, value and size (number of inputs and outputs). 
The current development, where small transactions are thrown out and not relayed by default client regardless their fee is IMO not good.

Nobody is pointing gun on you for not paying taxes. Actually lots of corporations find a very creative way to avoid paying taxes. Also, if you don't want to pay taxes, don't do it but don't use any tax-paid service then (public education, roads and other infrastructure, juridical system, police protection etc). You mentioned contracts. By using any tax-funded service, you are subscribing to contract with gowernment and you are obliget to pay taxes for it. If you use any gowernment service without paying for it, you are thief.
Don't kid yourself, nobody will say a word against you if you don't pay taxes but also don't use public roads etc. The problems with  people like you is that you want to use those public sertvices buyt cry theft when the gowernment wants you to pay for them.

Nobody is asking for large amount of small transactions. Colored coins don't need large amount of transactions. We are asking for small amount of small transactions, in other words, we are asking for posibility to send one satoshi with high enough fee so the miners would accept it. Why is it not possible? Bitcoin can handle small amount of small transactions without problem. The value of transactions doesn't matter for the size blockchain. Only the count does. With this change, Gavin is not only limiting the total number of transaction that will go to blockchain, he is also preventing every small transaction to get into blockchain regardles of the fee. This is IMO completely unnecessary restriction as reduction of the number of small transactions in the blockchain could be achieved using fees only.
Explain to me: instead of blocking every transaction with dust output, why doesn't the default client block only transactions with lower fees then some function of fee, transaction value and size?

Why do you think this is very relevant to discuss in bitcoin subreddit? I think it's quite offtopic. There is nothing in bitcoin which aims to replace entire government (and the need to pay taxes as a consequence). Bitcoin was designed to take control of money printing from government/central banks but it will not replace public schools, health care, well fare, juridical and defense system e.t.c.
I think anti-taxes anarchists are just abusing bitcoin to further their own agenda. 
We should keep the discussion focused and on-topic. If you want to make political post try to specify clearly what role will bitcoin play in your scenario, so others can dispute it. Crying "government is bad, taxes are theft" is childlish and has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:08:31


Because Bitcoin has so much advantages over traditional money. You can send it to anyone connected to the internet, it has potential to become good store of value, you can build completely new functionality  using bitcoin technology (colored coins, zero coins, name coins etc).
You can think that bitcoin shifts the power over the decision to pay taxes from government to citizens and it could be partially true for the moment but i think this is just temporary situation and the state will adapt to this new technology by restructuring the way we pay taxes. (For example you income tax could disappear as it is easily hidden using bitcoin anonymity but property/land tax would increase as you can't hide your house very well.)
There is no reason to think that bitcoin will replace all the government functions GP mentioned as the anti-regulations anti-government anarchists are trying to tell us.
