Very stable prices for the last few days . What do you think btc will do next?  Pure speculation I know , but do you think it will pump %5 out of nowhere or dump %5 for a while only to pump %15.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:29:46
It was around 4%
I wish it was 10
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:26:08
I hope it goes to $1000 , then I buy up and it goes back upto 13k
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:36:16
I wouldn't ever hold. If it dropped more then 15% from when I brought I'd bail out and wait. Otherwise like you say you just have money tied up forever.

Not worried about Facebook coin?
@_date: 2019-12-01 03:54:45
Orange it is
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:51:31
You're assuming btc will still be a thing in 2030?
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:53:32
And alcohol
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:34:03
You can die easily from helium.

Crypto in general is a giant gamble and the game is rigged.  Going all in for Bitcoin is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:44:40
Bitcoin sub is a ghost town any other time
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:35:54
Waiting till it goes to $20 then I'll buy
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:51:38
PayID is instant too
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:23:18
So if BTC isn't worth buying what will people look to ? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:11:44
You never win day trading
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:27:22
They won't ban if it it self destructs on its own.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:23:31
Too late!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:00:45
Because the graph goes from nothing much to absolute dogpoo out of nowhere.
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:51:12
Bitcoin needs to fuck off so everything else can grow.  Hope it goes to zero. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:03:11
Quantum is pretty funny though.  Imagine if Google did start to mine for shits and giggles , they could destroy btc in a few mins by the sounds of it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:19:41
She reads and follows too much social media. Getting made news for you makes you live in a bubble.
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:04:02
I think around 2k. We'll see.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:16:25
I'll buy at 2k
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:46:39
I think if quantum can break a code that would take conventional computers 100,000 years to do then I think a homemade code would be easy.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:44:59
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:14:29
Yeah it will
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:50:15
It can mine all the Bitcoin in a few mins. It's a cool work Xmas party trick.
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:49:45
Not on reddit
@_date: 2019-05-28 07:08:11
Yeah we'll Chu is full of it and can go eat a bag of dicks
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:24:12
The fact that BTC isn't regulated might be the reason for it's demise
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:31:49
Better off to sell now and buy back at the bottom. The ath of last year won't happen again. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:30:03
If people have no idea about btc then it's going take a long time to work out even how to buy it
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:26:36
I wanted to buy btc years ago to buy weed at the time with it and couldn't work it out. It's probably just as weird to new people now.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:26:49
I brought and  held for a week at the ath before I abandoned ship.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:58:08
Bitcoin is so non eco friendly that it's setup to fail imo.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:25:48
News in Palu have scared the whales I think.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:48:48
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:44:16
Pump - dump. 
Easy money.
This is non regulation for you.
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:23:45
Because his anti virus software said so
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:24:03
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:50:11
The longer BTC stays down the harder it will be to bounce back. The way it's setup is not efficient.
