Interesting responses. While I do think a deal will ultimately happen between Greece and the IMF/ECB/ European Council(collectively troika), the implications for the Greek banking system and thereby Greek people will be astounding. Right now, ELA(emergency liquidity assistance) funding for banks has stopped, along with other factors, opening up the likely possibility of capital controls. Syriza government is another pawn in the banking game in that they will be used to milk Greece dry to pay the "international financiers". If a deal is done, the troika will rollover the majority of the debt but still extract significant amounts of capital from Greece and impose crippling austerity measures that will be disguised in one form or another. But, once a deal is done, will Greece passively accept the new terms? I bet they will. 
All said and done, I am not too optimistic about global financial markets with the exception of bitcoin. As fiat currencies fail, as they have throughout history, I expect bitcoin to gain more traction. Lets see if Greeks start the movement.....

I agree that a flight to the dollar is usually what happens during a crisis. We are seeing that now with the strong dollar. But, let's say the Fed starts another round of QE, which i believe will be the more likely outcome over a rate rise. How confident are people in the dollar at that point? Conversely, if the Fed were to raise rates, the entire financial system would explode very quickly. Even based on the possibility of a rate rise, bond markets globally are experiencing incredible volatility on a daily basis. Dollar strength is a confidence game that the Fed will lose within the couple of years or shorter. BTC could play a part in the financial system once confidence in fiat currencies diminishes.
