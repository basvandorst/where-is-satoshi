Basically there was an opposition MP who was living in a state paid apartment. It has been publicly revealed that he used this apartment to run currency mining (tho it was an alt, not bitcoin as PM said). His "excuse" was that he did it to warm up the apartment during winter.
The MP was from the "Pirate" party, which positions itself as a "technologically advanced" party in our system. They are a bunch of naive idiots, if you ask me, no better than the current politicians. But they have been getting some attention from younger voters.

Growth in the economic sense doesn't mean that we are gaining more stuff, it just means that the numbers get bigger. Personal economical growth can be acquiring a house. Surely you don't want to save up money until you are 65 to buy a house, that's why people take mortgages when they are 30 so they can buy a house now. That doesn't need to be a new house, resources just change hands for, preferrably, higher price than they did so 30 years ago. In fact, saving up for 30 years is directly discouraged by inflation - something that bitcoin sucks at. If your money is more valuable the longer you wait, you have no incentive to spend, which would send the monetary system into hyperdeflation.

I know very well what the PoW represents. To elaborate: the current PoW is too easy to parallelize and thus incentivizes too exponential hashrate growth, which prompts more growth. There are ways to make it basically only run on CPUs with moderate to high memory requirements, but obviously now there is a huge lobby which is already invested into their hardware and will fight any and every change to the system.

Things like this really remind me how fragile our internet culture, for all its greatness, can ultimately be. A power with enough physical force can enforce anything they want. People using bitcoin? No problem, make all ISPs block traffic that contains transactions. People are using encryption? No problem, make all ISPs ban all TLS traffic (the old China route).
Internet was the greatest thing for democracy that has happened since.. ever. But it's good to remember that someone determined enough can take it away just like that.

As long as you live in the bitcoin microworld, pow is seemingly fine. But you have to remember that it's real electricity and real hardware that is being used. There will come a point where it breaks down, if it's not after the next halving (~2 years from now), I'd be very surprised, but in theory it may work as long as the price of bitcoin keeps growing without bounds. Which is the 2nd connection to real world commodity, no single thing in the economy can grow without limits without also forcing everything else to grow limitlessly, and we have seen in the past that circumstances where the economy is prod to show exponential growth only leads to bigger crashes down the road.

Yes, there was too much debt to begin with, but this is not exactly something that you can fix by taking inflation out of the equation. Creditors lend money knowing that inflation makes less valuable, that's why interest rates are adjusted for the current expected inflation (or you get current Turkey situation). Lending money is not a risk free business, when you lend money, it's your duty to asses the risks. Would a "sound monetary system" prevent a country from borrowing too much? No. But it would make it freakishly hard to amend the situation. If creditors lose money because a country borrowed too much and has to inflate its own currency to be solvent, that's on them. What you propose would rig the game completely, basically making it that as long as the world has an interest in certain countries not defaulting - ever (and instituting bailouts), then you can never lose your money. And if the debt was measured in an a global currency, then this applies twofold. Imagine no one in the world has the power to control the inflation of a global currency, debt no longer makes sense from the debtors point of view.
And before someone says that's a good thing - it's not. Debt is necessary for healthy growth of economy, personal or global.

You don't understand how bitcoin works. What you just wrote relates in no way to what the problem with pow is. But I'll bite:
Traditional banks do not have exponentially growing maintenance costs, with uncertainty in the future, no less. In fact, it's been getting a lot cheaper for banks to provide services in the past 20 years, which is why you now have free bank accounts, free transactions, free pretty much everything that you want from a bank, thanks to competition. Miners do not represent to bitcoin what banks represent to fiat.
You are simply comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin accounts are safe for now. When tech (or math) advances are inevitably made, they may be vulnerable for at least some time. Swiss bank account is backed by the bank, unless someone invades Switzerland and nukes your bank, that's where your money will be, at least figuratively speaking. The 2 services are something different completely.
Bitcoin's price is designed to be influenced by the market. 2017 has seen some manipulation, some FOMO, some late adopters coming in. But most of all, the price has looked more like a pump and dump scheme rather than a stable, growing currency (which is what you seem to want). 
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:15:19
The pow mining model is not sustainable long-term, especially if bitcoin is to be used more frequently in the future. It's something that works now, but will have to be exponentially improved (segwit or ln shits aren't good enough) or replaced entirely (pos has it's problems, it's an open question).
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:29:12
Except electricity costs will never disappear. I read your post and looked at the link, but despite my skepticism, there would still be manufacturing costs, maintenance costs, replacement costs, you have to put it somewhere, so there is estate costs, ... All that + the usual mining costs which are NOT related to electricity. There is no free lunch. And you would do well to remember that.

OK, so, tell me what you think happens in a world where you are not incentivized to spend your money, and saving money increases the value. You wouldn't spend past your immediate needs, increasing your wealth but decreasing your standard of living. The rich would get even richer even quicker. The more money you have, the faster your absolute net worth grows. The more you need to spend to stay alive, the slower you can get out of the situation
Borrowing money becomes incredibly expensive, because not only does the interest need to beat the growth of the currency, but you are also missing out on profits from saving the money you need to pay now.
You're an idiot if you think deflationary currency produces better economy than an inflationary one.

@_date: 2019-04-29 08:38:46
This is a very short sighted view, especially as you compare it to fiat, because what you are basically saying is that "this money can be trusted because of the process it's created and used", but that process can invariably be subverted in unseen ways down the road. If in 5 years someone comes with an algorithm or hardware that fundamentally cracks the process used, continuing to use crypto is 100% trust in the system, exactly like with fiat.

The drop isn't continuous. What you are describing would amount to mostly linear decrease, or exponential in extreme setting. But the price drop happens in teeth, which means there are only few entities actually selling the bulk.

Every 2016 blocks mined, the network looks at the average time taken to mine those blocks and adjusts difficulty such that if the hashrate of the network stays the same, the next 2016 blocks would take exactly 14 days to mine (or 10 min per block).

Ok, probably pointless to respond, but here:
The title is sort of correct, but retail market has a significant lag compared to online trading + the cards have been paid for in advance, at some vendors possibly for months to come and new ones are not due for a couple of weeks. Add to that the fact that NVIDIA has increased pricing to keep the cards somewhat available to non-miners, it will take a few months for the market to stabilize again.
The text itself though.. that's some top kek memes.

See, in many products, the barrier to adoption is notoriety. People simply don't know about your product. But this is no longer the issue for Bitcoin, my fucking grandmother, who uses internet once every month to read email she gets from family members, knows about bitcoin. Most may not fully understand how bitcoin works, but they shouldn't need to. Most people don't need to understand howTV works to watch it.
The problem now is that people have no motivation to use bitcoin en mass. And that will not change, not even given enough time. No business that wants to stay in business will stop accepting fiat, so the pressure of having to use crypto to even get what you want won't be there. It will stay a relatively niche product for a niche group of people. The rest just wants the fatx gains that they saw other people get.

That's just an ill posed question. It's like asking how much FPS in Far Cry 5 can you get out of all the thermostats in the world. Most of the hashrate comes from machines that aren't designed to do anything else.

Duds6, nobody reliable hires programmers you don't know over the internet anymore. Companies that used to do it figured out they were losing more money than it was worth that way and small business owners got burnt way too many times with projects either falling way behind or not being delivered at all.
The best they could do is start a company that does contractor work, but I don't know if that's allowed in Venezuela. Either way, the last thing the world needs is another country of shit tier programmers.

There are in total 21x10\^14 sats available when all btc is mined. There are about 24x10\^10 g of gold if we mined it all. And now I'm even being generous here, because the smallest amount of gold traded measures in tens of troy oz, not grams (1 oz = 31g).


Right now, there are a lot more things I can buy with both gold and fiat.


We don't, yet a large majority trust exchanges. My estimate would be that 80&amp; people who own any kind of bitcoin bought it and stores it on an exchange.
So yeah. BS thread, but nice try. Bitcoin is not the end-all be-all of currencies, but it's a step in a new direction.

If you want to be responsible with your money, you don't have to trust anyone with gold either. Your other points make no sense either, really.
As for gold being a function of demand.. well, so is bitcoin. And just like it gets more expensive to mine for bitcoin with increasing power of miners, so it does for gold. Have you seen some of the shit people do to get even a moderate amount of gold? Yeah, it's scarce alright. 
Gold jewelry is like HODLERS, taking away from the supply, increasing the scarcity. Except you get to show that you are a gold HODL, bitcoin not so much :)

That's my point. Healthy growth is steady. Getting excited because of a jump, a real strange one at that, is not good, because that doesn't mean the market is growing at all.
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:50:39
You just have to accept that there is no such things as "true value". Supply and demand is what dictates most prices. There is a changing supply of dollars and a changing demand for goods. If the supply of $ wasn't increasing, all but select few would quickly become collectively poor. In 5 years 1 bitcoin will buy you whatever its value in $ is. Currently it's not different from asking "how much will amazon stock buy me in 5 years?".
@_date: 2018-07-01 04:51:01
I agree with you on the fact that volume and price do not have to be correlated. But when the price jumps up almost 5&amp; in the span of a few minutes, it most definitely needs to be correlated with increased volume at that time to be "normal behavior".

Some questions are rather meaningless for someone who wants to be a user, rather than a fanatical follower. Like.. you don't need to know the name 'satoshi nakamoto' to understand and use bitcoin. 
What does ETH have to do with BTC? Or the 3 symbol ticker at all, for that matter? I'm pretty sure 70% of people couldn't tell you their homecountry fiat ticker symbol. Same with wallet incarnations, if you understand the principle, why bother with brands, it would be like asking a programmer how many text editors he can name.
SHA-256 is not a program, it's an algorithm (it's even in the name, dummy, secure hash algorithm, 256 bits of digest), and it doesn't encrypt anything. How much data can fit into a block is an implementation detail.
