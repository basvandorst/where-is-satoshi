E-mail various exchange support mails and ask hem If they have the control of that wallet and If they do that please they freeze the funds so you can provide them with a verification that LCB sent the funds and that you are indeed, the owner of that amount bitcoins. You have to do this fast, if the funds are withdrawen from the exchange then you are fucked and you cant do nothing. You may have some luck, binance did something simelar in the past. Best wishes.

The dude got scammed in LocalBitcoins, the dude withdrawed the coins from LocalBitcoins to another exchange, the blockchain is inmutable so you can't get your coins back except that you have the keys, in this case, the exchange has the keys so If he want to have the miserable chance of getting something he has to contact to LocalBitcoins and to the exchange who received the keys, with some luck LocalBitcoins would sign with theirs keys, the other exchange would verify that bitcoins are from OP and then he could have them back. Probably the scammer already withdrawed the funds from the exchange so there is nothing he can really do.
Edit: If you still don't get it; OP didn't touch the coins in any moment, he didnt hodl them in a personal wallet, he didnt send transactions; nothing. All was moved trought different exchanges.

Dont try to get reasons of why the market crashes or pumps, nobody cares, unironically it's all about the technicals, this move was predicted. And so was 6k to 3k and everyother move. I learnt this  after losing a lot of money; if you want to be a succesful investor you will have to learn, hopefully you dont lose that much, because you WILL lose, period.

what the heck is that?
60:6 = 10x profit.
60:3 = 20x profit. 
That means that if you buy $1000 worth of btc at 6k at the end of the day you would win 10k.
Otherwise, if you buy $1000 worth of btc at 3k at the end of the day you would win 20k.
I don't know your thinking but I believe that a 100% win or your gains matters.

BCH chain is splitting into two:
ABC (Supported by Roger Ver)
SV (Supported by Craig)
Craig is saying that he has the hash to do a 51% attack on ABC, indeed, he has. But the ABC suporters are saying that they count with the help of some btc miners. So it's probable that one of these chains go to literally zero.

Ok, lets begin; You sell at a loss, the other people stop selling their precious lemons temporaly (and even they start buying your lemons) you bankrupt and the other people start selling their lemons again.
If you don't like that example don't worry, I have another, lets suppose that you dominated the lemon industrie and managed to kick off your competitors, you know start selling your lemons at $12. I see that and say "what the fuck with this dude", I realize that I can sell your exact lemon for $5 and still make profit so I start selling them, and kbom, you are out of business, but this happens again; other dude sees me selling for $5 and thinks, "I can sell the exact lemon for $3 and still make profit" and kbom, Im out of business,  and so on and so on until the price of the lemon reaches the previous equilibrium price.
Natural Monopolies aren't bad, Monopolies that are created by the help of the goverment are the worst thing that can happen; when that happens you have an industrie that basically haves no need to compete because the goverment is blocking others to do so.

It's not a "thinking" it's maths soon, people that buy at a determined price have specific targets depending on their investment, what I am saying is that buying half the price will give you double the gains, if you think that doubling your gains is "not important" and it doens't make the difference, be my guest.
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:31:51

He didn't "put" the coins in wallets, he mined a lot of coins when the hash power was practically nule, for each block he mined, he received 50 BTC as a reward in different wallets, for example, you can see that the wallet that received the reward from the block 20.000 (50x2000 = 1M) is intact so it is said that he probably is in posesion of those wallets.

70% of energy is renovable, confirmations usually get done in less than 15 minutes (1 second trought Lightning Network) fees are super low, more than 120M$ with a fee less than 5$ (1 sat/byte trought the Lightning Network), little progress is being made to improve the network: LN, Liquid, Segwit, and more things that you can search by yourself. Anyways, you can go and support the shitcoin of your preference, but stop saying that you are the "next btc" because that is never going to happen.
