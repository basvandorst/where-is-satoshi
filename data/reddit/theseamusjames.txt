This is super, super useful. Thanks for that.

Fair point, but their initial rush was a lot more powerful than our initial rush. When we get more data down the road, I'll post an update.

Don't take it so much as a comparison to Overstock, but rather a test of the hypothesis that accepting BTC as a payment method is in itself enough to generate sales. There was a time when that was the case. It seems that time is gone.

We do ship internationally. I'm not sure where you can read reviews of our stuff, but I can tell you we have a very large, very dedicated fan base of our brand.

We actually surveyed our existing customers and a large majority said they would like to see Bitcoin offered as a payment method (we're also big in the tech scene, so that may be why).

Given the choice between paying with BTC vs. paying with a credit card, though, you would prefer to pay with BTC?
Would having that as an option make you more likely to buy or is it the product alone that's going to influence your decision?
I guess I mean if you like a jacket on our site, and you like a similar jacket on a different site, do you think you'd be more likely to buy on our site because we offer BTC as a payment option.
We're trying to judge the novelty factor of offering it against the business value.

We're consulting a lot of different sources, but I figured I would still ask those who actually DO use bitcoin.
We're a clothing company. Betabrand.com

Here's some of our recent press:
* [Buzzfeed](
* [Huffington Post](
* [Time Magazine](
* [Washington Post](
* [The Today Show](
We are a startup. Side note: I just checked our site status and we seem to be humming along just fine.

Fair point, but as a business decision, we have to weigh how much of an advantage having BTC as a payment method could gain us, both in notoriety as well as strategic positioning as an early adopter, against the cost and risks associated with building and maintaining the code required to accept it. It's certainly not my decision to make. I'm just on a fact finding mission.

I was wondering about that myself. Why spend BTC at $450 when you could wait a while and get twice as much product. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
