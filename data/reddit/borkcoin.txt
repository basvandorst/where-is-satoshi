re 1:
perhaps I'm missing something but the way I understand it the effort involved is 
1. develop test and merge code to:
  
  a. allow miners to indicate their support for 2MB blocks.
  b. detect a supermajority of miner support indicated by a. and     start a grace period countdown (and notify all unupgraded nodes)
  c. increase max block size to 2MB once b. has been detected and grace period passed
now I understand that PRs for such code are already available and basically constitute the bitcoin classic branch so what are the coordination efforts involved  ?
re 2-3
segwit being ready will further increase the tx capacity to effective ~4mb size which should be welcomed by all players as far as I undersand

I understand that eventually everyone must upgrade for a hardfork but it seems miners are a special class in this particular case since they are the ones who produce the blocks, so if you wait until a supermajority of them are ready and begin a grace period is there a reason to believe that the non-mining full nodes won't upgrade without an explicit coordination process taking place ?
re 4mb block size  - it would be an effective-tx-capacity with segwit but the max physical size being 2mb  so in what way  won't it work under the current conditions ?

that's an interesting point (which i'm not sure is widely known by their detractors, do you have more info on that?) but: having a large sum of bitcoins unlockable in the future provides only partial incentive alignment with the rest of the bitcoin owners - if for example in the future the cost of creating transactions will vary greately for different classes of bitcoin owners. also in principle blockstream could have provided them with other forms of compensation such as equity or stock options.
but it doesn't directly address the question - what are their objections to a 2mb max blocksize increase while still going forward with segwit/rbf/LN ?
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:32:06
so basically the main objection is on the grounds of it being a hard-fork whereas segwit/LN  can be done via soft ones ?
wouldn't the fact that it's consensus-triggered remove the main concerns of a hard-fork, that is bigger blocks won't actually appear until enough miners have upgraded and opted-in ?
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:12:07
thanks !, by consensus-triggered I meant miner consensus (supermajority) with a grace period which is indeed different from full-node consensus, could you elaborate on the objections that you heard against *any* increase in block size ?
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:24:35
with a block out every 10 minutes a 1mb to 2mb increase would mean roughly 4.5gb vs 9gb per month consumed by a full node, that's equivalent to watching one extra netflix movie a week in medium quality, it's not little but if this kind of increase makes the difference between being or not being able to run a full node then sounds like bitcoin has a problem already where this sort of capping takes place.
how will segwit/LN  reduce the bandwidth required to run a full node ?
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:37:44


right, so my takeaway from this would be that people with such caps are already unlikely to be running a full node so a 2mb max block size  probably not gonna cause a sharp decline in full node count. btw what *personal* incentive does a non-mining user even have to run a full node today ?


ok i'll need to read up on this more to understand how it works
