It's a strange misconception that censorship, authority etc only have meaning when they are "by the State". After all, the state is just a lot of people agreeing on a rules. There can be authority and censorship in any group of people working on anything.

I'm also a Russian and if there's any rule which has 100% prediction power with our government nowadays, it's "yep, they will do it". Three years ago it was unthinkable that we'd have a way to block sites without court order or even warning in hours for basically an excuse (any part of this was unthinkable). Nowadays it doesn't even feel strange. As long as there's no powerful government ally for Bitcoin (and so long I've only heard of Gref), it *will* be effectively blocked here because there's nothing which keeps our government in check anymore. And at the very least, BTC-e is not going to be able to trade with Russia. 
But knowing how Russian citizens think nowadays, it's not impossible that they just close to not anger the government. Or maybe move somewgere else, if they do that fast enough then BTC-e may indeed stay.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:10:09
What are you going to do with bitcoins if there's nothing you can buy? And there's nothing, because business is risky as it is. If you're openly going against government, you're basically giving them card blanche to ruin you.
And it's not like bitcoin works by magic. It can be banned. My provider already does DNS hijacking so that even google's 8.8.8.8 does not resolve banned sites. 
Amongst the hardcore users Tor is prevalent as in "I know Tor exists". But the majority of users only use VK (Russian Facebook) and a bunch of other sites all of which do not need to be blocked because they'll bend.
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:40:47
Bitcoin needs at least some support from major governments. I'm sorry, but most goods and services are still sold in country currencies and to have a chance at gaining adoption, bitcoin needs to be bridged to those. For a long time, and maybe forever (unless it really becomes the predominant means of payment everywhere, which is not that likely).
Governments cannot block bitcoin once and for all, but they can do it a lot of harm. They can block its protocol. They can stop exchanges and make it very, very hard to buy bitcoin. Foreign markets? They can be blocked. Person-to-person exchange? Blocked. Sure, every block could probably be circumvented somehow, but not many will bother.

This one will be passed. It's a part of a larger set of "anti-terrorist" laws which tighten the screws on the internet users. It's a question though if they'll care to enforce it with bitcoin, and what exactly they do. Ban the protocol? Ban foreign exchange sites? Force local exchanges to keep tabs on users? (They require providers to keep half a year of your browsing history within the same set of laws)

Honestly, it's a good question and "no one" is a bad answer.  It's idealistic. No one owns the protocol, but there *are* people who design it and code reference client, and people are going to accept their choices by default unless they're really bad, and maybe even then.
Answers like "no one controls it" are a good sales pitch, but these people are going to regulate bitcoin, and they have to really understand it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:08:35
I think rarefied is right. Without a private key, you *cannot* create a new transaction, not before, not after, not with 51%, never. Other clients will not accept invalid blocks. So if I just asked you to pay Sally, even with 51% you may either do that or not, and that's it.
The problem with double-spending is that you may first pay to Sally, as I asked you. Sally then waits for 5 more blocks and reasonably believes this transaction is accepted and not going to change. She then gives me what I paid for (e.g. a burrito which I eat). And then you decide you changed your mind, hash 6 more blocks starting from the block where I have not yet paid Sally, and that block chain becomes the longest and my coins are officially back in my pocket.
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:58:09
It's not the answer. The protocol cannot be created by "all participants together". If you think for a moment, it's obvious. It's just a way of saying that most people agree on what's happening.
It's not that different from how countries are supposedly run. Who controls the U.S.? "People do." In theory, yes. In practice, not so much. People do exert some control. Everyone's agreement is needed to some extent. But there's still someone in power. That's what they wanted to know probably.

Yeah, if you think about it, people trust banks because banks know what they're doing. Of course banks screw people but it's a managed risk, because there's society which is supposed to stop banks if they cross the line and take too much.
So in the end people trust society.
It's like an implied insurance. You can still lose everything if you screw up really bad, and you will still lose a bit just by playing this game. But in general, if you act *more or less* reasonable, you're going to *more or less* preserve your funds.

It's not difficult at all for a state to shut it down. Ban trading in it, crack down on anyone listing prices in or accepting BTC. Ban BTC traffic or subject it to torrent treatment ("Oh hi, we noticed you've been mining bitcoin, this is your last warning").

You're in for a huge surprise then, telling you that as a Russian. The thing everyone realized in Russia and barely anyone seems to get in the outside world yet is that we're already back to USSR. For at least two years now our govt has been cracking down on freedoms and passing stifling and outright totalitarian laws left and right. Bitcoin is nothing to them. They don't care about innovations, heh, we're in the biggest shithole since the fall of SU and going down with an amazing speed. Basically nothing is developed here anymore. Any "innovation" is someone stealing federal funds with full approval of the government. We don't have any technology. We don't have any ambition. Bitcoin? Fuck it, who cares. I mean, obviously some people care, Gref cares maybe, he's more or less a smart guy. So there's a chance. But if not for Gref, mostly everyone in the government is only concerned with stealing and keeping people frightened, passive or dumb. 
Bitcoin? DHL, UPS and FedEx all ceased to deliver private packages from over the border starting this week because our customs now require a copy of the buyer passport, a copy of the document which proves that you live wherever you've ordered the package to be delivered, a photo of what's inside the package, a warrant to handle customs on your behalf (original document) and a scan of a credit card, which should be owned by you, the same person who bought the package, and the same person who will receive it. (And a written explanation of why addresses are different, if they are!) I'm not fucking joking. Yeah, and also you can only pay with credit card. Bitcoin, nope, lol. Not even paypal.
Next week Duma's debating the law under which you can only order $150 of stuff from over the border a month. And I bet my socks over it, they're gonna pass it. Duma hasn't been nicknamed "The mad printer" for nothing.

You don't have to prove in a mathematical sense, you only have to prove beyond any reasonable doubt.
For instance we know Mark controlled that wallet which moved today because of the transaction earlier. It was possible he lost the keys but since the coins moved this is refuted. Perhaps someone stole the keys, but if you ask witnesses and they tell the keys were stored in two or more locations, this is also refuted. He once had the keys to 200k, he had two or more locations where the keys were stored, the keys were used today - facts point to that he still owned the keys today.
It's possible that he stored the key only in one location by mistake, and that location was hacked. That too can be fact-checked. Detain Mark so that he can't destroy the evidence. Ask the witnesses and build a list of all places where key backups could have been stored, and the procedures to access/update the places. Retrieve any logs (for example if this is a secure bank cell, they probably track who accessed it when). Retrieve all data. Ask Mark to tell all required passwords if it's encrypted (I think he has to, having declared bankrupt).
It's possible this would lead to nothing and there would still be reasonable doubt that Mark really was hacked / had no key backup. But it's also possible to find some evidence against it.

Of course trusting the app with your life savings just because it has 4.5 stars is stupid, when you put it like that. I'm not saying this particular error is somehow okay.

Trusting 4.5 stars was wrong, but it was not methodically wrong. It was a brain fart. Brain farts happen, there's no method to avoid them.
What *is* methodically wrong? Out of the top of my head:
1. Handling all your money at once. One mistake and you have lost everything. Handle in $1500 or 25% batches at most and then wait for at least a few days.
2. Investing all your money at once. Never invest more than 30% in one place, no matter how surefire and good the opportunity it is.

What's the point of waiting 24 hours though? Small chance the owner will notice the turmoil and move funds in exactly this small window of time. You're adding more to the chance that someone will steal it before you.
If you find it acceptable to claim funds, claim now. If you want to maximize the chance to help the owner, maybe it's best to move the funds to a safe wallet and leave some kind of note explaining how to contact you and what proof of ownership do you expect? I don't know what can serve as one, though. Probably an explanation of how the funds arrived there, with proofs.

Compared to fully random long password, words are easier. But the guy above was suggesting a method. If his methods gets known, you only have to brute force the parameters:
1. Number of decimals he uses.
2. His postal code (it's even cheaper because he uses only a few last digits).
3. Number of times to hash.
4. Name of his first cat.
Reasonable sized lists can be generated for all of this. He's kind of protected by the fact no one knows his method though. But not all methods are hard to guess.

You're describing the survivor bias. You're right that it exists. But it works only while the chance of this happening is realistic at all.
In other words, if you take the whole population, the probabilities must dictate that someone *has to* get lucky. If you have a 1% chance and 5000 people, someone's almost certain to win. Claiming that on skill would be survivor bias.
But if you have a 0.00000001% chance and 100 people, and one wins, that's not a survivor bias. That's skill. Which is why I said that at some point you have to recognize the results.




If I flip a coin 20 times and it always comes up heads, I totally would. I would be quite dim otherwise, wouldn't I? The coin that comes up heads 20 times in a row is certainly not random.

That's kind of correct. Though if he had a lot of good days in a row, and then one bad day to wipe it all, that's still a fair deviation from random that might say something about his skill.

@_date: 2018-02-03 10:18:23


Math doesn't work like that. For all 7 billion altogether, having 7500 is quite probable. For any single participant, having 20x0 or 20x1 is 1/20^19 and having a rigged coin is more likely. It doesn't change if you run billions of other draws. It's still 1/20^19. Their intuition is right.
Survivorship bias only works when you look at all the 7.5 billion draws together. If anyone who got 20x0 was sure to come boast, you who observes all 7.5 billion would likely get 7500 people anyway, and getting just this much does not tell you of their skill. (But if you got 750 000 with 20x0 instead, that would still make it likely that coins are not fair.)
You can't really avoid this. If you're getting results improbable by chance, it is probable that this is not just chance.
The lottery example only works because you *know* it's a fair dice, and don't have any other explanations for why your weird sequence of numbers came out. If you imagine a maybe-lottery where you're maybe drawing a fair lottery ticket, and maybe a rigged one, and you win, and then asked if you think it was rigged (you can't look at other participants) - well?


Sure you should think it's in large part due to luck. I fully agree on that. I'm just saying it doesn't have to be "pure luck"/"pure skill": both are likely involved, and it will show on the results.

A set of all 20 long sequences which our intuition recognizes as clearly unique and interesting is small, compared to 2^20. Your intuition is not comparing one 20 long sequence to any other, it's comparing "getting a sequence out of that set" vs "getting any other sequence". And it's right that it's improbable.
What's more, with 20x0 in particular there are plausible explanations. It's hard to imagine how a coin could non-randomly come up heads and tails in a Fibonacci sequence so it's a bit less probable, but "always comes up heads" totally can be done.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:10:32
Scoff all you want, if you throw a coin 20 times and it comes up all heads, in the real world, you know you'll think it's not random. And you know your intuition will be right.
Now you only have to explain to yourself why, if your understanding of math says otherwise. Meanwhile, I know why :)

That's an interesting idea, but what should the network do while waiting for your data block to arrive?
Should it start looking for a next key block right away? But what if your data block never arrives? The whole network is stuck waiting for it -- for how long?
Or should it continue looking for an alternative key block while receiving your data block? Then you aren't really "the czar" until you finish transmitting the data.

Blocksize increase means you have to send and receive large blocks quickly to be able to verify what's happening. Their suggestion loosens some requirements. The data is distributed evenly through the time it takes for a new key block to be found. Though of course there might be a lot of drawbacks.

Not because of that. It doesn't matter whether the protocol is "native" or not. All sufficiently advanced payment protocols can be used to pay for goods, as well as web page views, no matter what underlays them.
It was defined as "reserved" because it was only outlined, not laid down as clearly as say 403 or 404. Not all implications and use cases were clear.

Because if that's true then I don't really care about their backstory, this is indeed ridiculous. And if not true, then they're simply lying and their backstory is again irrelevant.

If an intelligent mind knows how you expect not-them to behave, they can always emulate that. No amount of being unlike Satoshi Nakamoto proves someone is not Satoshi Nakamoto.
Which is why it is much more interesting that it was the only time Nakamoto's account ever reacted in any way to the witch hunt.
After being silent for all these years, he broke his silence just to clear the accusations of someone who's not really looking like Satoshi Nakamoto anyway! How strange is that?
If I were to assign probabilities, it's more probable that Satoshi Nakamoto's account was hacked.
But if it wasn't, then indeed no matter how unbelievable that may look, this gives certain support to the idea that Dorian Nakamoto is not so unrelated after all.
And there's enough evidence around the guy that it really starts to look not so unbelievable. He worked as a software engineer and then pretends to not have a clue about modern technology. Two people confirm he said "It's been turned over to other people, I'm no longer involved" and then he explains he assumed he was being asked about his government work. Was his government work called bitcoin?
Then he comes and holds an AMA here on reddit where he answers questions in a "that's not me but if it was me, here's what I would have said" fashion.

There was an article on this subreddit about how programmers are not economists. It convinced me that unfortunately, bitcoin may indeed be doomed to remain a get rich quick scheme.
I don't have the link now, but the key idea was that deflation is extremely bad for a currency. If the coin rises in price, there's simply no reason for anyone to give it away for goods. The only logical strategy is to hold to it. But the currency which is not used for trading is nothing more than a bubble.

I was always wondering, couldn't these "fair dices" just let their own addresses win? There's no way to check who's playing. To make it less noticeable they may let people win, just somewhat less often, and the bigger the stake, the bigger the difference between the expected probability and the real one.
E.g. you play 50% dice and get:
* 1 BTC  49% prob of victory
* 2 BTC  47%
* 4 BTC  44%
* 8 BTC  40%
etc, so that it's always improbable that you spend enough BTCs to play enough games to prove that the distribution regularly isn't fair in your case.

I think they imagined this as a way to measure what *everyone* wants. Instead they learned that a relatively small number of their customers wants bitcoin *a lot*. Every single of those say 5% of customers went on and voted for bitcoin, while most of the remaining 95% just didn't know/didn't care to vote for what they want. But that doesn't mean they want nothing.
To put it in another way, if Dropbox spends time to add bitcoin support, it makes 5% of users happy. If it instead polishes the UI, it makes 25% happy. That's what will happen despite that bitcoin suggestion is at the top. So they saw this and realized the whole idea was flawed: it wasn't a way to measure what the majority wants, it was a petitioning tool. The results still mean something, but they probably thought it's better not to let anyone have false impression that they are going to implement what's on the top first of all - only first of stuff that's on the same list.

It doesn't really mean that. First of all, there's no clear "meaning" to most Japanese names, they aren't even words. There are names which are words and separate kanji have some meanings, and at times they combine to form something meaningful, but other times it's more like a feeling: "This name has POWER in it, it's a strong name".
Second, there's usually no combined "meaning" of name and surname, they're different things.
Third. Naka is "inside, at center", moto is "ground, base". The kanji 賢 means "intelligent, wise, clever"; it's not read as "Satoshi" in texts as my dictionary tells me (it's a name-only reading), but there's a word "satoshi" which is written with different kanji and means "guidance, admonition". So it's probably "wise" in this sense.
Make what you want out of it, but it doesn't seem to me that they planned to tell anyone anything with this name, except maybe for choosing "wise" as a name.

At the time bitcoin wasn't that big. The most likely explanation is that he simply died; people die all the time. In fact, someone should take the registers of deaths in the week after the date for the suspected countries of origin and study it, that may be the shortest route to discovering his identity.
By the way, does anyone know if this is the last ever *action* performed by him? I.e. was he still mining after that? For how long? Were there any transactions associated with him?

If they find torrents for pirated software on your torrent tracker, it probably won't help if you say "I just let people upload random data here, since it random it might resemble illegal torrents". This is a joke of an excuse.
Now, judges are not robots and they may to some extent accept that "this is just a blockchain", but this alone *just doesn't solve it*. They'll require you to delete it, perhaps implement some measures to prevent it from re-appearing.
You just can't get away with "Yeah, anyone can distribute any CP to all participants and it'll be there for ages, and we are not going to do anything about it, just don't look at it". That's ridiculous.

Yes, but if you want to be smart about it, at least read some books on investing. I'm sure most of them will say something about diversifying risks.


Even if crypto currencies succeed, it's highly possible in 10 years there will not be a trace of bitcoin left. I'd plan for 1 year investment with the possibility to extend it if successful.

You didn't? How did you expect it to be protected then? Basically, anything you can do with your PC, a program can do too. If you can open your wallet without typing password, a program can, too.
It probably just scanned the memory for anything that looked like bitcoin private key and sent out those.
@_date: 2013-05-02 12:51:17
Unfortunately yes. I think it has something to do with psychological investment people do into bitcoin when they invest currency. They associate themselves with bitcoin, any criticism they take as a personal attack.
They might not notice that, but if you criticize something else, say some promising cancer cure they believe in, they'll just shrug their shoulders and say "time will tell". But not bitcoin. If you doubt bitcoin, you're stupid, you're brainwashed (or brainwashing), you're part of conspiracy, uneducated, how can't you see, etc etc.
Take this case. Some guy I've never heard about wrote some article which criticizes mining... who the fuck cares? Really.

Technically, there's not much which stops you from exchanging dollar for services. That tomorrow you can buy less for it is not because government interferes with the exchange protocol, but because it influences its valuation through its actions.
Mt Gox influences bitcoin valuation, though to a lesser extent.

Holy fucking shit.
If you're not a troll, this is what you do: whatever you have in cash, you give to your sister and never, ever, in your whole life, under any reason whatsoever, touch.
Whatever you currently have in bitcoin, you keep in bitcoin and never, ever, for any reason whatsoever, sell at least for half a year.
Not even "sell and then buy back". Nope. Not for any reason. Not a single trade. Never.
Half a year later you give everything you own in bitcoin, without selling it, to your sister. She will decide what to do with it.
This is the only strategy that will work for you. If you do not follow it, you're doomed. You will ruin your future, and worst of all, you will ruin your sister's future.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:34:46




Uhm, you're the reason. If you say that they "haven't learned anything" from bitcoin rise in price then *the thing you've been teaching them is that it's a pyramid scheme*. More people join, more people bring real money, existing bitcoins are valued more.
Don't you see it? They're just logical. You ain't saying "you can pay in amazon with bitcoins now", you say "the price will continue to rise". That's the definition of a bubble scheme reasoning.

1. Wikipedia is not the place for advocating for or against bitcoin, for establishing or maintaining or discrediting its image. Please keep this in mind.
2. Anything which goes into the article **must** be backed with sources. This is your main weapon. It's hard to back such a broad and vague as "has been associated" (by whom? how do you define "general population"? where's the proof?)
3. In turn, if you can back two things: a statement and it's relevance to the article, with sources, when you have all grounds to add it to article.
4. You will probably not be able to back the idea that "all currencies has been associated with crime". This is vague and irrelevant. (You may mention it as an example, but don't actually add it)
5. You most likely have a ground to request making that sentence more specific or removing it. For instance "According to [source], in 2012 more than a third of all transactions through bitcoin were made on illicit sites" is a valid, factual, backed statement.
6. Although all currencies are dirty, the idea that some currency is *predominantly associated* with crime is a valid idea.

Bitcoin has miners and users. Miners should have been called "managers", actually. They receive transaction requests from users and add those to blockchain, and then at some point one of the miners finds the solution and their blockchain additions are accepted.
Users don't really need to have the blockchain as they can't influence it anyway; to add anything to blockchain you have to mine that block.

Unless you're a mining pool and you prepare a block beforehand, and then bet on that you could hash and attach it fast enough after making a dice bet. With high return dices this will be profitable.

While I agree with your position, it has worked. I don't know about modern generation, but if in the USSR it was practically unthinkable to not understand fractions. Almost as bad as a person who can't read.

That's not being neutral. "We ARE neutral. Lots of people just don't feel blacks deserve the same rights as everyone".

Russian here. Gref does talk about Bitcoin but he doesn't seem to understand it very well. [Source](






Background: Yandex.Money is a relatively cool payment service which was developed by Yandex (itself a relatively cool company, founded by a liberal, scientifically minded Segalovich, nowadays dead from cancer, sadly), then sold to Sberbank eventually. Needless to say, the technology behind YM has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
I don't know much about Gref but I remember hearing from people that he's relatively smart, compared to our other politicians.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:14:53
It's post-factum explanation (and not proven, at that). Sure you can tell the difference between "it was planned like that" and "we invented a reason why the thing we do just because it's sometimes profitable suddently turns out to be also good for others".
Remember, we're not arguing now whether it's profitable or not, but whether it's "the same thing".
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:12:55
They may, or they may not. There's just too many factors in this equation.
 * There are technological limitations in bitcoins most of which are hand-waved with "I'm sure someone will do something".
 * They are hard to use. Tell this to BTC maniac and you hear "then don't use it" but the next moment they're assuming everyone eventually turns to BTC.
 * A new crypto coin may emerge. Again, BTC fans say this is absolutely impossible because of BTC's hard-earned trust, then invest in litecoin the next day.
What can be reasonably assumed is that for some period of time (say 1.5 years) within a certain population (mostly, educated computer users) bitcoins will probably continue to gain favor.
They will also continue to be used for shady transactions and their monetary value will slowly grow over time. (Compared to the $15-$30 they had before the bubble)
What happens in two or three years is completely unpredictable. Anyone who says that "it's obvious" or "it's highly probable" is getting carried away by the enthusiasm.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:18:26
This is actually a pretty reasonable prediction, if not even an optimistic one.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:45:40
There's a huge difference, and it's obviously in that wordpress is many times simpler. You take a page from the DB, apply some filters and send it through the network. *In addition* to this Gox has to actually process transactions and they have to be super careful not to lose money.
Now, I'm not saying they're not a joke. Maybe they are. But OP's reasoning proves nothing.

Yes, I too think this is some stupid idea that you have to be "balanced" or you're wrong. There's plenty of cases when it makes no sense to be balanced, and it's sad that people cannot take someone's opinion as a mere *viewpoint* instead of either "the ultimate truth" or "a lie".
Viewpoints are different in that you can consider many of them. For instance, you have to punish those who break the law, but you have to be forgiving. Both are viewpoints and if I think that our society is too harsh I might write an article "Where's all the forgiveness?" but that doesn't mean I don't support punishing at all. I just stress some point or detail I want to bring to attention.

It's not the similarities that make things "the same", it's the lack of major differences. Working for wage and buying represents the exchange of services. You do something for others, they do for you. While playing on the market, you earn and lose without doing any additional work. There's no exchange of services, only exchange of their monetary representations; this is a byproduct of a way our society makes exchanging services easier.

I think at this point no one cares about bitcoin **network**. There's been tons of decentralized networks in the last years, it's not even a novel thing that we can build something which is, protocol-wise, not easy to take down.
I suppose, technically people expect bitcoin to just work. There's nothing to wow about. It works, just as torrents or emule or email or jabber do.
But bitcoin is not only a network, it's a currency. And it's being compared to other currencies. And when people say it's a **decentralized currency**, they mostly don't mean it "okay to be controlled by a single entity as long as the network is up". They mostly mean no one can control it, protocol-wise or otherwise.

While you can do whatever you want with what is yours, money laundering is hiding the traces of illegal activities. In any society breaking the law will be profitable, and any society needs to put obstructions to breaking the law.
Do you respect private property? Those who intrude on private property are evildoers. But when a bunch of people band up and share their land between themselves, suddenly intruding on that land is "arbitrary, very hurtful and should not be called illegal immigration".
"But, but, the country is more than everyone's private property". How so? Split US in 300 000 000 parts, each part is private property. Part of that is in "private property, private use", the rest is "private property, shared use".
"But who gave them all that land?" They took it themselves. How else do you define initial distribution of properties? Saying that "country took it and then gave to them" is just adding another step. People claimed the land as their property, this way or another. Intruders are not allowed.
Or are you an anarchist and deny any law? But we don't even know anarchy works. Of course you want it to work. It seems obvious to you that it would work. But there's tons of ideas which were obvious like that but didn't work. There's so many problems with anarchy it's even more of a fairy tale concept than communism.
