The weakest hands had already folded, the rest of us were expecting something tether related to happen so not exactly a surprise.
Just another day in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:28:47
Really? Thought they'd done that already.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:13:39
There's too much temptation for the bot developer &amp; serious money involved.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:51:23
BTC thrives on adversity, Schnor to deal with spam, cross chain swaps replacing bad exchanges, LN for scaling, SegWit to fix mining exploits. So.... all good.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:27
Nope, its still the very early beginning of the beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:54:08
Hell yes
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:21:41
You're probably right, which is sad.
It might redefine 'loyalty cards' - open a 30 day channel for your usual gas purchases &amp; you wouldn't want to buy gas anywhere else.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:07:23
Apart from charts on my desktop &amp; alerts on my phone, hardly at all :-)
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:18:35
Excellent! Good for them. 
The world needs more smart people who can take the inititive because lets face it, we're drowning in a sea of stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:41:26
Not at all. 
I made a nice profit, then bought coins I believe have a future.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:41:49
Let me see... there's the South Korea FUD, Coinbase spamming, 'Ver-de-mort's groupies doing their thing, mempool is full, memepool is boring &amp; Kraken has been down for nearly two days.
Other than that, its been a bit quiet really.....
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:00:32
Schnor will make it expensive to spam.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:10:25
Would you like a Ritalin? ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:12:12
That would go on the 'nice to have' list.
I'd prefer the devs focused on Segwit/Bech32/Lightning for now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:25:24
Jochen's node was probably reset

Fees get reduced every time there's a '*really good meme* - we've not had any recently so fees went up.

They'll all get one of my wallet seed words, first one to figure it out wins.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:08:36
Yup, you got it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:47
Probably both
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:13:15
No point in running more than one full node in one location.
You need a good internet connection. Initial sync uses just over 150Gb &amp; you get a new block to store every 10 mins.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:15:05
They wont.... fast transactions on LN will make the exchange prices converge.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:19:43
Seriously? Nothing better to do than trawling day old posts ?

Paypal to *anycoin* is a problem.
I've offered to buy ZEC a couple of times from folks who posted they're selling for GBP, but I'm just 'some random guy on reddit' and there's no way to get around the obvious trust issue with paypal.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:41:04
Really doesnt matter much - short term price wobble then the difficulty adjusts &amp; back to normal.
Kinda hope they do it - nice buy opportunity &amp; then China can't cause any more problems.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:39:52
10k has been tested many times now, looks like a floor to me - just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:19:55
Everyone would freak out, weak hands would sell, price would go down, mining difficulty adjusts, smart people buy, price recovers. Rinse &amp; repeat.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:24:23
Seems everyone who doesn't write code wants everything done right the hell now.
The devs should take all the time they need to do it right, review everything, test it properly, trial it, then carefully deploy.
......this isn't Win 95/98/ME/XP etc, it's far more important.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:44:00
I agree, however there are bad actors with deep pockets who can influence exchanges/wallets devs.
In time Darwin will sort it out, they'll die out as more people become aware.

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:45:55
Scaling is a massive challenge for all decentralised coins, the little ones are too small to notice and no decentralised alt has a viable solution.
BTC, as always, gets to feel the pain first, then fixes it properly.
Imagine what will happen when LN deploys.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:46:09
More likely to commit to LN nodes &amp; grow investment through tx fees.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:37:39
Interesting question.... perhaps you can pay one channel with the other.... anyone?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:28:59
Sure they're trying, their spelling has improved.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:39:52
I buy at a target price that I feel reflects its value, and I expect that price to increase over time otherwise I wouldn't do it. I also hold my imvestments for a long time.
When people get caught up in FUD/FOMO its a bad thing, emotionally driven investors make poor decisions, they usually lose and it amplifies volatility. Hence my comment.
This isn't a race, its a marathon, and in my opinion its only just getting started.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:21:38
Without at least 150Gb it a'int gonna work, so not looking good for the Pi project.
As for location/owner, the more diverse the better. Geography doesn't really matter.

Spammers gave up, they probably ran out of other peoples money.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:00:01
There's plently of mining outside China, the difficulty adjusts automatically to fit what is available.
It would make the price wobble &amp; a great time to buy. Afterwards, no more China issues.

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:47:06
Not 'pushed', but 'available', and I don't consider it 'full of bugs'.
Alpha/Beta releases dramatically increase the number of testers, which is essential for proper testing in real world circumstances.
Its so those who want it in their products/services can get an early start. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:29:14
...and it ends with 'Why wont Coinbase implement SegWit'.... hilarious. Well done!

All of the above - plus the strategy could easily be to build a 'pump-n-dump' botnet for their own benefit.
There's just too many ways this could be abused &amp; no real way to earn the trust such a bot would require.

Hard forks are Bitcoins way of getting cancerous growths removed - not really interested in what happens to the tumors afterwards.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:29:24
Not even slightly. Anyone can open a channel to wherever they like, makes no difference to the user.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:21:54
Lightning gives stupidly fast transactions for a ridiculously small fee and scales massively..... so problem solved as that's almost here.
Try it on testnet, if you want to be one of the 'brave/reckless' first adopters you can join the intrepid few on mainnet, or just wait a while for it to be tested/deployed with the careful rigour a multi-billion dollar network deserves.

@_date: 2018-01-21 20:37:24
There's a strong 'sense of economy' here (hopefully a delicate enough way of saying it) - and few who know anything about crypto apart from mainstream media.
We do have an exchange (ChileBit) - their daily volume reached 1 BTC yesterday, not exactly liquid but trying. Santiago does have a Bitcoin ATM, just one, not sure if it works but its a start.
Its early days, I'm very fond of my adopted country &amp; sure it'll catch up.

Please call it 'btrash'.....
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:13:39
Possibly - it depends on how 'normal people' consider BTC compared to traditional hedges like gold. Think the price would spike, but probably not 'explode'.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:37:15
Coinbase deserve some pain but this wouldn't work.
Just move to another exchange &amp; encourage others to follow.

@_date: 2018-01-28 00:32:10
Perhaps you could tell us just before you trade?
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:33:52
If I've understood correctly the wallet does support it, although the GUI isn't finished yet.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:47:11
Think that depends on how many transactions they route in the early days, after all you have to connect a wallet to  somewhere. 
Maybe they're wallet devs, maybe an exchange (which would be nice), who knows? I would happily open a channel via an early adopter to use LN for my own needs and if they get a % thats good.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:53:42
So empty the cash register &amp; stuff the fiat into the ATM....  
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:34:29
Excellent, I'm sure that will push the price up.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:24:05

Anyone worked out the cost per square metre?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:42:42
Its naive to think petitions will influence a bad actor - best to vote with your money and move to another exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:57:42
Perhaps, there's always a 'learning curve' for people switching to a new site but its not *that* bad.
Willing to bet other exchanges would love to eat Coinbase's lunch, if 'making it easier' is what they have to do then they're probably already on it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:49:48
I disagree. At this *very* early stage developers are key. 
You can market the hell out of a donkey, but it'll always be a donkey.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:41:43
If Facebook uses 1.5% and Bitcoin 0.2% then its a no-brainer - turn off Facebook &amp; the world will cheer (and probably get more done!)
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:05:57
Transactions go via the lowest cost route, whatever that happens to be at the time.... with stupidly low fees *nobody will care* if they go via a hub.
A channel to 'somewhere reliable' and another 'somewhere local' makes sense - that's what I'll be doing when its not considered '
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:38:59
The first exchange to do it will make a massive gain - any that don't do it promptly will wither &amp; die. Just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:38:35
Candles are green going up, red going down....so, yes, green is good.

Hardly a surprise, but there are other exchanges.
When enough people move Coinbase gets dethroned.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:41:45
Agree - difficulty adjustment makes BTC immune to this, even a total ban would only have a short term effect.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:58:30
Yep! There's some serious money changing hands today.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:33:11

@_date: 2018-01-12 15:52:01
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:50:24
Yup. Its a hell of ride but fun/profitable for those who dont panic.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:11:56
Its a good thing to try.
It proved to me I was a really shit day trader so I stuck to mining/hodling - much more profitable.

Not here, at least not until you can recognise FUDsters &amp; shills.
Focus on the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:57:20
Here y'go :-
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:28:13
Now that's just silly.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:58:50
Its a working SegWit wallet - which was not what was claimed.
The GUI is expected soon anyway so I don't see what the fuss is about.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:54:30
Not that bothered.
Its been expected for quite a while &amp; the market had already priced in most of the bad news.... just another day in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:36:11
Its ALPHA code, which means its reached a state where it can be played with BUT expect there to be bugs. Good to learn on but not ready for real money, it gives exchange/wallet devs a chance to start working it into their systems.
BETA code will have less bugs, after that you have a release candidate thats ready for general use.
Never hurry testing/release, the risks are too high. Remember what happened to the B2X fork ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:37
I just dont want to see the DragonballZ memes again.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:40:29

Maybe we can crowd-fund.. it'd also give a huge boost to world productivity!
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:51:09
I doubt that.
Ridiculously low fees and stupidly fast transactions, adoption wont be an issue.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:14:40
Hodling practice
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:22:01
True. It might also encourage people to upgrade, there are a hell of a lot of old nodes out there.

Welcome to 'Troll Spotting' on @_date: 2018-01-21 14:51:44
The first exchange to do that will have one hell of an advantage over the rest. Suspect we won't have to wait long.

Really? I was hoping for the guy riding the rocket......
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:17:33
All I've done so far is send coins to my exchange which supports SegWit.
There's some fiat/alts there for my next BTC buys &amp; when I'm done pretending to be a 'day trader' I'll move everything back.
Not sure which wallet I'll use next, not talking millions so a phone/desktop  wallet will do for now. It was going to be Electrum but was a little spooked by the security update/alert.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:06:07
Not a dip, its the end of a spike. 
It'll start creeping up again when all the hysterical newbies have left.
Just my humble opinion. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:00:00
Probably. I treat them as buy signals :-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:04:34
Exactly, its excellent progress.
These early birds will also be able to route a lot of transactions when LN starts deploying and make a commission - well deserved in my opinion as they're taking some risk. As more nodes crank up the fees will drop dramatically. All good stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:21:49
1. Yes, legacy to segwit is a normal transaction, but they're really cheap right now so its a 'good thing'
2. Segwit to legacy is a segwit tx, so you save.
3. You'll need segwit to start using LN, so its also a 'good thing'
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:24
At least its not a Vegeta meme
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:55:09
Thats why I'd open two channels, probably one to somewhere 'big', another to somewhere local (probably the pub).

If they're do the same with fiat withdrawals as BTC, its because they want to pay you in pennies.....
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:22:09
Thats a good idea, easier to ignore the FUDsters.
Maybe a bot to sweep them into one thread?
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:20:04
Yup, early adopters, although a lucky (or smart) few were even earlier.
It has a long way to go yet, crypto tech has to scale massively before that can happen, and as usual BTC gets to solve that problem first.

That's a good question 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:23:42
I think you're wrong that it will snowball, but everyone is entitled to their opinion.
I like seasonal dips, they give me the chance to get more &amp; as crypto is in its accumulation phase (and will be for some time!) I think its a good strategy.

Sorry, I don't believe the last time you looked at porn was on a 14.4k modem ;-)

Its almost Christmas, people are spending spare fiat on presents, food, booze &amp; having a good time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:44:06
I'm sure they do, but after they've seen the same memes 1000 times it takes a special effort to amuse them.

Not much of a gamble then  ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:42:26
I believe this is just the very beginning, we're a long way from 'early adoption'.

Network capacity scales up with efficiency, even more so with off-chain transactions.
Too much capacity means less profit for miners, so they stop adding capacity and an equilibrium is reached.
More efficient miners make a profit, less efficient miners have to either quit or upgrade to stay in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:15:50
I bet you're great fun at parties!
There will certainly be a correction at some point, but I dont think it'll be that bad or last more than six months.

The final chapter :-
Ten seconds later Alice raced back into the living room with the Ledger Nano in her hand and a victorious smile on her face, jumped over the couch, into the kitchen and plugged it into her mothers laptop.
‘Ok Dad, now, think, what did he say ?
‘He said ‘apple doughnut dog banana picnic sugar orange pickle coffee btrash vermin sandwich moon’
Alice carefully wrote down the words, wrinkled her nose, then looked up at her dad.
‘You’re sure?’
‘Pretty much’
‘But that’s thirteen words, it can’t be, only supposed to be twelve’
‘Did he say anything else?’
‘No, I’m sure the last word was moon, seemed really important somehow’
Alice sighed, looked at the list of words again, and clicked the ‘close’ box on the Ledger.
‘We’re going to have to think about this’, ‘Hey Mom, what’s this Youtube you’re watching?’
‘Its one of those things your Grandpa sent me, but you shouldn’t watch it, you should turn the computer off now because its late’.
‘Why can’t I watch it?’
‘Well, its a bit rude, you know how your Grandpa is, so please don’t….’
Alice had already clicked play, then clicked pause at just the right time to catch the interviewee making an ‘internationally recognised finger gesture’, she started to giggle.
‘Alice, it’s not funny’
‘Sorry Mom but I just figured it out – according to him ‘Its not Bcash’ - and I think he’s right!’
‘The list of words….’, Alice quickly started up the Ledger again, muttering under her breath as she typed in the words, 
‘apple, doughnut, dog, banana, picnic, sugar, orange, pickle, coffee’,
‘Skip Btrash because its not a ledger word’,
‘vermin’, for some reason Alice smiled as she typed that in,
The room fell silent as Alice &amp; her parents gazed upon a ridiculously huge number and the beginning of an ‘extinction level event’ for traditional banking. 
‘Alice, did Grandpa give you that pink thing for Christmas?’
‘He showed you how to use it?’
‘Sure did, he even put $50 in it for me as a surprise present’
‘Lets get him something nice, he’s always liked The Bahamas’
‘We’re going on holiday to The Bahamas with Grandpa ?’
‘No, we’re going to buy them for him’

I'm sure it happens - the 'canary' I watch for is when Monero spikes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:57:18
That would be nice. 
Miners have high operating costs so if spamming made them risk going offline it'd be a strong deterrent.
Obviously a much better solution would be a swift kick in the nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:27:49
I think the miners get paid main chain fees by the LN channel owner, but the LN channel owner gets the LN fees from whoever makes the transaction.
I could be wrong, thankfully there are smarter people  than me on this sub &amp; I'm sure one of them will comment...

I've found the price slides when mempool/fees/delays have grown and are being FUDed, so thats when I buy a little more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:49:01
We only just at the beginning of the beginning, so a little patience is necessary. LN is a game changer.
My investment in BTC is really an investment in Lightning, as its already alpha mainnet its not much of a gamble :-)
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:43:35
A proper scaling solution must be able to handle more transactions than Visa x 1000 - Bcash &amp; BTC have gone in different directions.
BTC is going with Lightning, which among other things will allow hodlers to make a profit from running nodes and routing transactions. Each node strengthens the network, pushes tx costs down, increases scaling. BTC has lots of hodlers.
Other coins have gone with huge blocks which can work for a while. Dinosaurs ruled when size was an advantage but needed huge resources to survive, which made them vulnerable to change.
Bcash gets support from those who want control over the resources, Bitcoin wants decentralised everything. The two will never agree as there's no common ground.
Crypto is a world of rapid change, coins that cant adapt will wither. Some will find niches where they can continue, like crocodiles, but a mainstream coin has to be a small furry mammal - preferably one of Andreas' mutant rats that can survive anything.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:22:03
Sorry about that, we're all at the pub, back soon to buy more.

I think ZEC has the right approach. Sapling/zk-starks are supposed to make it light enough for a native phone wallet.

I heat my office with a mining rig, which makes me 'carbon neutral'. :-)
Think about the energy used by GLOBALLY by traditional banking, all the data centres, the power bill for every bank office, ATM, etc. 
Now look at how the efficiancy of mining hardware has gone up over the last few years, do you seriously think it wont continue to improve?

If I've understood correctly the LN transaction fees go to whoever opens the channel &amp; they get to pay the BTC fee when the channel is closed.
So... I could use my hodlings to operate a channel, charge a small fee for its use &amp; make a profit. I would certainly get into that &amp; offer minimal charges to encourage use - I bet many others would too.

Interesting &amp; well said, but I think it unlikely to happen with crypto. 
There are so many ways p2p networks can operate, strong encryption, tor, etc, and many people who would work hard to make that happen if necessary.

The paramedic reaches into hodlers jacket pocket &amp; takes out an old beaten up leather wallet.
He opens it up looking for some kind of ID but all he can find is a 'Toys-R-Us' discount card from 2009 and a crumpled $20.

No, its just part of bitcoin growing up.
Once the news is out on mainstream media its already 'priced in'. Sure, the price wobbled a little but not by much and has almost recovered already.
Now imagine what would happen to a traditional stock if the company received the same attention. Bitcoin redefines resilience.
Just my humble opinion.

@_date: 2017-12-24 02:10:24
If its paid for it has to be processed, otherwise trust is damaged.
A strategy for spam email thats a favourite of mine is a 'tarpit'... the spam gets processed extremely slowly so it ties up the senders resources. 
Perhaps something similar, maybe a 'tarpit mempool' for spam transactions.

No ugly hacks please - LN is a game changer and I prefer the devs take all the time they need to do it right.
Have faith and imagine what will happen when its deployed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:53:39
You're right. I was thinking about when wallets are dumped with 'dust' in them. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:32:51
The rest of the story :-
An ambulance arrives to take the poor hodler away, slipping quietly down the darkening street into the distance with its lights and siren off, leaving a sad empty feeling behind it.
The passerby continues home, warmed by the greeting from his exuberant nine-year old daughter as he opens the door. He pours a scotch, settles into a comfy chair and turns on the television to watch the evening news.
‘…...and in local news, earlier this evening an as yet unidentified elderly man collapsed downtown. Medical services responded promptly but unfortunately he was pronounced dead at the scene. If anyone has any further information that could help identify this man or his family police would like them to call on the following number…..’
‘I was there, look, that’s me on the news, talking to that cop’
‘Really????’, says his wife, ‘That must’ve been terrible’
‘It was sad, some poor homeless guy folded up on the street, only an illegible card in his wallet, think he was Mr. Notamoto’.
His daughter stops teasing the cat with a ball of wool, suddenly intensely focused on her parents conversation, which was something that almost never happened.
‘Nakamoto?’, says the little girl in a very quiet voice, then holds her breath.
‘Satoshi Nakamoto?’
‘Could be’
‘Did he say anything? Anything at all??’
‘Yeah, just some rambling words, didn’t make sense, something about a dog and food’
‘Daddy, I need you to think very carefully and remember exactly what he said, its really important.’
‘OK, but why?’
‘Because we’re gonna sweep the trash out of that wallet and sell it for 1 cent, but we're keeping the Bitcoin’
‘We’re going to do what?’
‘We’re going to be rich beyond our wildest dreams and have some fun’, she yells as she runs to her room to get the pink Ledger Nano that grandpa gave her for Christmas.

When efficiency goes up the miners use less power which reduces their costs, they're *highly* motivated to upgrade and do so all the time.

Debt is created by loaning money, banks operate on fractional reserves which means loaning money they don't actually have. No state privilege, just business as usual.

Depends what you want to do.
Phone wallets are for 'walking around money' but the worse kind of storage, a desktop wallet is better but not brilliant, a hardware wallet is the best solution.

ATM's are an expensive way to buy.
Better to set up an account on an exchange, deposit funds with a bank transfer, then buy your BTC. Also, on an exchange you can set a buy/sell orders with the price you want - worth the effort IMHO.

@_date: 2019-03-01 15:57:05
Think you need to factor LN in that.....
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:02:58
Think its the other way around... Bitcoin is the answer to the renewable energy problem.
Mining creates demand for power which is an incentive for more renewable sources.
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:03:11
Yes, Segwit fixed 'transaction malliability', which LN depends on.

Lots of Venezuelans here in Chile, many send  money home using BTC as its their only safe option.
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:24:50
Perhaps, but its a wonderful place, plus we have an exchange that allows LN payments.... so there's that. :-)
Think you're missing the point, BTC is providing a way for these folks to send funds internationally when they simply can't trust (or use) the banking system.
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:24:49
Depends - here in Chile you can buy BTC &amp; the exchange allows outbound LN payments, its all very simple &amp; they even have a nice app.
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:04:51
It means receiving to the same address, its a 'bad thing' as it makes an obvious connection between accounts, its also unnecessary.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:51:03
Excellent news! Bien hecho ;-)
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:35:49
It went South??
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:37:38
My 'local' exchange here in Chile has already done exactly that.
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:46:40
Its on mainnet, there are wallets, even my local exchange supports it.... so yes, its here.

I think it'll drop below $400, too much downward momentum for a smooth landing plus there's all those  coins stuck on exchanges to consider.
Might be in at $250.... maybe...  but probably not.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:29:41
Sure, why not.
My first rig was two 1060's dangling out the back of a Dell desktop &amp; running the power supply at its limit. It had an i7 cpu so mined Monero as well, not a lot, but something.
Upgraded by slaving a second power supply &amp; making a rack to hold more GPU's until I ran out of slots - then got a 'proper' motherboard.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:17:40
Its a good thing IMHO.
It gave ZEC a hellof a kick so think it'll do the same here, BTC is so much bigger that the same news had less impact.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:41
In terms of what the world will need when crypto really goes mainstream, they're all small exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:54:23
Seems suspicious how close it holds to $1200, I wonder how much its costing to prop it up......
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:32:09
Yup, its an out of control marketing meeting, best avoided.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:50:46

@_date: 2019-02-24 23:25:24
You need to mine 24x7 and crank up the clocks until you can make toast on it.
Mining difficulty increases so over time you'll get less coin per day, you have to really go for it to recover the cost of equipment.
You're prob better off just buying coin instead of mining hardware.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:15:16
In some countries (like my adopted one) its the only option.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:48:23
I think it'll be like the tide coming in. 
BTC &amp; mainstream alts will rise at the expense of 'the other coin', but that's just my humble opinion.

I'm guessing Chile ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:59
Lightning Network solves scaling like you wouldn't believe and something BCH simply can't do - BTC will go nuts at that point.
Meanwhile expect more of the same FUD from the 'usual suspects', just sit back &amp; enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:16:25
They'll fluctuate together until the next big dip. BTC will recover, the other one wont.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:59:07
Tethers found.....
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:53:15
Eventually there will be something as crypto will get too big to ignore. 
Maybe attached to transaction fees so it works like a sales tax but thats just a guess. Way too early to worry about it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:13:39
It'll slump a little first but only briefly, kinda lumpy is completely normal :-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:17:04
Not a dip, its already back to where it was TWO DAYS ago!
Wake me when something more interesting happens ;-)
Are we going to have to the the whole 10k thing again?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:29:24

Nope, but ask me again in 10 years
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:47:56
They'll say 'its a really big bubble'
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:27:41
Dunno, but its an interesting time.
BCH dumps - buy it with ZEC, Roger pumps it back up - sell BCH, gains go to BTC &amp; balance back to ZEC, rinse &amp; repeat :-)
Are we all having fun yet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:00:28
There's always 'something' going on &amp; I stopped worrying about it ages ago. 
BCH tried &amp; failed with the world watching, I doubt it can ever recover from that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:36:35
It just dipped again for half an hour, $7830 to $7710, which seems to qualify as a dip as its back on its way up again.

@_date: 2017-11-24 11:13:11
Patience. 
A proper solution takes time, and I'm deliriously happy for the devs to take all the time they need.
What's needed is scaling that gives many orders of magnitude while remaining lightweight, fast, and decentralised, and this is exactly what they're doing.
A quick &amp; nasty hack is never a good idea.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:51:55

These points are valid for any coin thats going to last, the tech, people, plan, history, features... if any are missing it wont last.
BTC will always be there, it adapts and evolves at a sane rate which makes it an excellent store of value.

When they pump it attracts noobs &amp; some will buy.
For many it will be their first crypto purchase &amp; they'll soon learn more, discovering BTC is at the top of the food chain and just how easy it is to switch.
Sure, some will get burnt, but those that dont SODL will switch to BTC and make it back.

LN is the fastest way to move Bitcoin - hope that helps :-)
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:09:30
I'm looking into this as well.
What'd be nice is if the customer could pay with whatever they like (fiat card or crypto), a payment provider to handle the transaction &amp; conversion into the crypto of your choice.
The payment provider makes a commission through their exchange rate, the customer can pay with whatever they want to (even fiat), the online store gets paid in crypto &amp; everyone is happy.
Sortof a 'modern day Paypal'....

@_date: 2017-11-21 21:22:58
The is no such thing as money, there never has been.
Money is just an expression of confidence, as in 'I beleive a dollar is worth something because its backed by the US'.
It will come down to 'how much confidence do they have in BCH', I think when pressure is applied the honest answer is 'not enough'.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:42:38
Ha! Lets hope so.
If someone throws 1k at btrash thinking its bitcoin how long do you think it'll take them to realise they bought the wrong one ? 
Doesn't take long to flip back to BTC. Shapeshift, even Cryptonator lets anyone do that without losing too much.
Bring it on.

From what I can see its not far away.

I mine an alt I've always been fond of and I only trade it (reluctantly) for coins that serve a specific need.
BTC is a my bank vault, coins check in but they never check out. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:40
I presume B will be available for a 0.1 transaction while larger sums find different nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:08:59
Bitcoin is always at 'war' with something, but you don't win wars by reacting to your enemies. 
Given the huge amount of talent focused on development I believe the next scaling solution will be *way* better than increasing blocksize.
BTC is code that runs a $118 billion network, its no place for 'quick &amp; nasty hacks'. I'm happy for the devs take all the time they need.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:03:07

A large exchange has a problem &amp; goes offline, causes over-excitable traders to pile onto smaller exchanges, which buckle under the sudden load &amp; some more fail....rinse, repeat.
Just calm the fuck down!
I'm sure the smaller exchanges will learn from this &amp; add capacity, they like going offline even less than we do.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:00:28
Yup - but wouldn't it be nice if it could all be done at Revolut without having to go through an exchange. Fingers crossed.

Not even slightly worried.
My naivety &amp; dumb luck paid off. In at 420 from alts, out at 1490 to BTC - so long 'other coin' &amp; thanks for all the fish as I wont be back.

@_date: 2017-11-24 01:37:17
The harder they pump the shorter it lasts, and it costs more to do it every time.
There's a ton of BCH locked up on coinbase (and others), when they're released its game over.
At some point they'll run out of other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:52:41
Ever owned a gold brick ? Or property ? They're expensive, buying/selling has costs and takes ages, but its great to have lots of them.
Bitcoin is no different, except its better, easier &amp; cheaper to trade than gold or property. Its a way to store value.
Sure, the costs are a pain but who in their right mind would 'want' to buy a coffee with BTC? Eventually that will change but a value store is exactly what I want - the adrenaline from days like today is a bonus.
HODLing BTC, trading/gambling/guessing with alts.

Depends what you want to achieve &amp; how much risk you enjoy - my goal is to accumulate.
I only sell when the price spikes up (a lot!) and everyone is running around like 'hyper-caffinated-five-year-olds' - but only enough to replace cash reserves for buying dips.
Fud-fests are for buying, never a good time to sell IMHO.

Yaay!! More quantum fud!! My favourite buy signal :-)
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:44:01
Nobody knows, nobody cares, the challenge for crypto in general is the massive scaling needed for real world use.
Fees find an equilibrium. Low fees weed out inefficient miners &amp; difficulty adjustments take care of changes in capacity. Its nothing to worry about.

Sceptical. 
Anything that could connect your identity to a node (where there may be a wallet!) is a 'bad thing'. 
Most have no clue how to secure a machine properly, then there's spearphishing, malware, etc. If the node machine is used for other things there are lots of possible exploits.
Just my opinion, lets be careful out there.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:19:43
Kracken - worked nicely for me.

Give them another 5 years and they'll be able to pronounce it
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:46:01
SegWit plus LN should give an enormous boost to scaling - certainly enough for medium term without increasing blocksize.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:37:02
As its your system people would have to trust *you* are doing as you claim.
Nodes already have an interesting life, or at least mine does according to firewall logs.

They were the last to mine transactions under 5 sats/byte last time we had low fees, so nothing new.
Expect them to continue doing whatever to support their agenda. In the long run it'll cost them $$ and make their coin even more toxic.

@_date: 2018-02-23 01:58:56

Its the beginning of the month &amp; takes a few days for funds to move from paychecks onto exchanges, the stock market just took a shit &amp; bitcoin is slowly going up again. 
Likely to see a cautious recovery, at least for a while, just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:12:49
If mining profits go down the less efficient miners quit, difficulty adjusts to match hashrate &amp; maintain blocktime.

@_date: 2018-02-11 16:11:38
Think we're going to bounce between 8k &amp; 8.6k a few times before anything significant happens. Just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:24:46

BTCPay is interesting, but its part of a server hosting deal so not quite what I'm after.

Eventually bitcoin will evolve to a private layer &amp; we already have ZEC, which is where the privacy tech originates from.

You're right... but its like when someone tells you 'the cheque is in the post'
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:39:07
Errrm, yes???
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:59:03
It means you can use some of their tech in your own stuff..... which is nice of them.

0-conf = 'The cheque is in the post'
It depends on the level of risk the seller is willing to accept, which depends on the value of a transaction.
LN means no risk even for extremely small amounts, so a better solution IMHO.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:02:13
Not 'brainwashed' at all, just impressed with LN progress and its potential.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:45:28
Excellent! Best one I've seen all day :-)

@_date: 2018-04-10 23:05:32
Maybe, maybe not.
Takes a lot of money to move a market, risky play as there's always a bigger whale somewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:39:51
@_date: 2018-04-20 20:40:25
Thats correct. The opening &amp; closing transactions are visible, but thats all.
Kinda neat. Its not fully private as you can still see how much is in each wallet after settlement, but its better than it was.

Glad Twitter did something, long overdue.
Sets an interesting precedent, r/btc is in the same position &amp; Reddit may just follow.
Going to get more popcorn, don't want to miss the show.

We've already had this discussion way too many times.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:44:30
LN is a huge step in the right direction, and a giant leap for crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:59:32
If your address starts with a '3', then you're good.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:43:41
yeah.... you should cross post.... they'll love it 'over there'
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:26:28
I'll go with LND for now, seems a better fit - thanks for the feedback. :-)

BTC has its own testnet &amp; is scaling with layers, doesn't need BCH bloat.

No, it isn't

Probably lots, its programable money....
Doesn't really matter. Set your trades &amp; wait until the market moves, could be hours, days or months. Volatility pays the pacient.

Ticket costs USD $10, it scares the crap out of you for years &amp; they pay you $10000 at the end.

@_date: 2018-04-20 00:34:47
Every confirmation adds security and trust so it really depends on how much you're sending, for example :-
0 conf = idiots only, it hasn't really happened,
1 conf = maybe $100,
2 conf = $1000,
3 conf = $10000,
4 conf = $100000,
5 conf = $1000000,
6 conf = (choose a very large number!)

@_date: 2018-04-20 20:29:52
It helps, but your wallet is still visible and opening/closing a LN channel updates it.
Basically, not every transaction can be seen but your balance is still published.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:40:02
0.04%... wow.... that many!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:55:11
Patterns are very subjective, people tend to see what they expect. 
I keep an eye on moving averages but thats about it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:59:01
Yup, standards are wonderful things. Just wondering which is easier to play with.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:00:29
Bcash is too toxic to last IMHO, no interest in holding it.

No confirmations *is* a risk, but as you'll only lose the cost of a sandwich I wouldn't worry too much.
You're going to love lightning....way better.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:15:28
Latest wallet from bitcoin.org is your best place to start.
As for that 'other coin', best avoided. Read this sub for 20 minutes &amp; you'll find plenty of reasons why.
@_date: 2018-04-20 20:48:48
Agree, LN is bringing a lot of good things &amp; thats certainly one of them. 
Right now its a little complicated for muggles to spin up LN &amp; explore but thats quickly getting easier. Exciting times.

I wouldn't hold your breath... it could be a couple of weeks!!!
Think it gets kicked out of the mempool after a certain number of blocks have passed, no idea how many.

Lightning is a fast way of moving BTC around, its not a coin
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:25:10
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:00:17
Well spotted !
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:37:20
Blocks still have to be mined, LN needs on-chain transactions to open/close channels, huge sums will usually be moved on-chain... so not much will change for miners.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:12:21
Probably go up then.

Huh, well, not really. Costs are so tiny I just wrote it on mainnet &amp; tested there. Local exchange supports LN payments so that made life even easier.
Nice having choices, strike is quick/easy to integrate. I just prefer to make my own.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:59:59
Added LN to my project yesterday, makes all  other payment methods look bad.
6 seconds to pay &amp; stupidly tiny fees - it rocks.

Just keep doing what you're doing, eventually the 'tail will wag the dog' &amp; they'll have to adapt before the 'tail beats the dog to death'.

Buda.com (aka SurBtc) 
Works well here in Chile, you can also withdraw via Lightning. Just checked &amp; they operate in Colombia.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:57:34
My understanding is the tx would not get mined.
Eventually, and by that I mean a *long time later*, it gets dumped &amp; the sender gets their funds back.
