If your a true Hodler then you never get out of a position. Only take profits after certain points. My advice, if this is true which has the potential to be, then buy as much as you can afford as close as you can to the bottom.

It output 261 keys, and I copied over the recovered wallet, but I did not open with the -rescan option nor am I fully synced. How do I open with the -rescan option?

At the moment I just run the program through the exe(I'm using Windows). How do I run it from a command line (Sorry if that sounds stupid)? I'll leave the client to sync all night because its 4 years behind so its got some catching up to do.

Alright I'm finishing a scan with Recuva and if that comes up with nothing, then I will try with this. Thank you

Alright just launched after rescanning and still says no bitcoin, but I am still 3 years behind so I am assuming it wont show the correct amount until its fully synced. Also yes I replaced the new wallet with the recovered one and named it wallet.dat

Alright no luck after fully syncing with the network. Tried scanning hard drives and doesnt seem to be working. At least I learned my lesson.

Only 0.5 so not that much but still not something you want to lose. And yeah I'll message you.
