It's a bumpy ride today...

I can smell the FOMO building up after the fire sale.
EDIT: or maybe not

That's pretty much what bitconnect said they did. It's save to assume that anyone who would claim to be an expert crypto trader and is willing to let you in on the deal, is just running a ponzi scheme.

Yes, I know, it's been a long and gruesome wait!

Some would argue that it's not a good sign for a currency when it changes in value by 25% in a single day
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:49:29
And miss the roller coaster??? That's the whole point of bitcoin

$8250. Here's another number pulled out of an ass.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:35:34
HEY, THIS GUY THINKS I'M A RETARD!
see, nobody cares
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:43:05
Down ~~10%~~ 12.5% in 15 minutes???
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:52:57
haha, I'm looking forward to getting expelled for a thousandth of a satoshi

The technical term is FOMO
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:23:09
The volume today is just insane. Just a steady influx of trades. This thing is going to the moon.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:50:54
Exactly. Except we didn't. Stop pulling numbers out your asses, please!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:58:22
It's 12.8k here. Are you time traveling?
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:45:28
I agree that big pumps are not organic growth. That argument would be about as stupid as saying every big dump is market manipulation.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:38:37
Wait until BTC hits 20k before shooting yourself. Don't worry, it won't be long
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:39:41
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:26:02
Just out of pure curiosity: I'm a grad student in Computer Science and have access to a machine with a GTX 1080 GPU. How much BTC could I mine if I let it run over night?
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:28:23
I agree, the depth chart on bitstamp looks very unhealthy atm.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:22:33
Big dump = market manipulation
Big pump = organic growth
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:44:54
So what your saying is that you want your own comment removed?
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:56:53
All the 9k, 10k, 11k, etc. memes have lost any meaning. Where going straight to the moon baby
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:42:31
I was waiting a veeeery looong time, all morning basically, but BTC just broke $8000!! Join me in popping some Champagne!

Is this real life??
Seems like the twitter answer got removed. What did it say?

The sickest thing is that we're still up 6% for the last 24h.

I just tried to order something on amazon with moon. I used it in summer a few times, but not since... It's not showing in my browser anymore. Is it still working for anyone else?

Haha, I know, I'm Swiss.
But according to this ( the most expensive pizza in Zürich is 34 CHF. Where did you pay  60$?
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:00:34
You don't wanna mess with zombies, bro
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:36:44
30$ per pizza? Must be a hell of a pizza
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:19:45


In other news, you can now buy everything in Central African Francs. Did you know that with only 1$ you can get more than 500 FCA?
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:56:13
Horrible math. You can't take the one minute where GDAX is dominating the market and say this is 3% of the market. He should take an average day on GDAX to estimate how much is traded per minute
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:09:49


What?? How? That part of the argument doesn't make any sense
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:30:38
That's amazing, thanks
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:16:10
We have broken the resistance. Repeat. We have broken the resistance. All the enemy base are belong to us. Over.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:37:44
If I understand correctly, you predict McAfee to keep his chunk?
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:56:41
Yes, I did read the 2nd half. But it seems like a one off thing. It doesn't provide any information about how often this happens or whether these counterfeiters were caught.
Compare this to how many scams there are in crypto and the argument seems very shaky.
Don't get me wrong, I'm invested in BTC, not in gold or any other crypto. I just don't like when people just state things because it fits their preconceived opinion.

Just used my first btc to actually buy something, using the moon extension for chrome. This is actually really awesome! The first real use case for mass adoption that I have come across.
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:10:55
Somebody really messed up. They drew the candle of the head and shoulder pattern in the wrong direction

Let me guess: This is your first rodeo?!
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:51:42
Yes, exactly this. Except maybe not, in that case, no.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:04:10
Welp, I certainly hope the market doesn't crash while I'm busy watching Game of Thrones...
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:03:24
Is it coincidence that the last push was at exactly 12:00 EST?
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:43:31
I don't really know how to read those graphs, but thanks for sharing and giving your estimate. I thought it could potentially take more than a day. I'm relatively new to the game.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:51:01
I just used BlueWallet for the first time, where you can choose your own transaction fee. I'm not in a hurry, so I set it to 10 sat/b, for a transaction of around 0.02 btc. How can I find out what the expected transaction time will be?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:22:56
The market is volatile like crazy.

You telling me you've never had a picnic with a $100 milly bet discussion?
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:11:35
The only rational answer is that he plans to buy $100 milly worth of bitcoins

Hey guys! Bitcoin broke 8k for the last time. Hold on a sec. This time really for the last time.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:03:30
Question about Coinbase Pro: Are they even affiliated with Coinbase or is it something completely different? I use regular Coinbase right now. Will it incur a transaction fee if I move bitcoins from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro?
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:15:05
Are they planning to pay federal, state and city tax?? What about the soda tax?!
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:14:13
Do you have any good source on where we're at with the Mt Gox coins? I haven't followed it since last year
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:50:41
Is this based on anything but speculation?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:01:52
OMG, IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!11!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:24:37
Does moon only make the payment while logged in or does it record the options and order it through a 3rd party amazon account?
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:00:41
What bothers me most about the bitcoin community is that so many people just make these bold and absolute predictions, using arbitrary numbers that are not founded it anything. Just because you want this to be true doesn't mean anything in real life, even if your prediction comes true.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:25:27
So, ummmm. Guys. Just don't panic. I'm serious, please don't panic. Oh, fuck it, I'm panicking.

Doesn't sound like a serious problem to me. That article talks about just one case from 2012.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:17:01
ok, now I'm scared
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:40:30
I think we're hitting this wall at 8k, because if it rises more then the Vegeta meme will come back out and everyone is just tired of that joke
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:17:08
I checked out [ but many of my questions are not addressed. How does it work exactly? Is this in collaboration with amazon? Which wallets are supported?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:10:25
Here we go again. Get your flippin Vegetas ready!
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:23:33
Well, we can talk all day about so called "facts", but at the end of the day, I think it's *garbage. \\s*
