You're being downvoted because you're really, really wrong.

Isn't the core of this discussion actually around the httpserver? (dominated by Apache httpd).  Both example URIs are discrete and the server would need to choose how to handle it.

It's funny to watch this because a) you don't understand the issue and b) you aren't educating yourself by reading about the issue.

But continue following your line of reasoning... Why would a government want to print money?
Many people respond with conspiracy theories but a more reasonable explanation: nations need to protect their currency markets from foreign trade manipulation. No sinister undertones required. 
Regardless, I don't view Bitcoin as a replacement for fiat, more a supplement albeit a disruptive one. Just my opinion.

But don't things like Doge and Coinye etc. just serve to fragment the coin community? For any coin to become widespread it needs to widely adopted which essentially puts these coins in competition with each other...

I disagree. There was a reason the world abandoned the gold standard and created fiat...

This is somewhat important info.

No, you don't.  That github commit did not explain your position and you're still wrong to blame Bitcoin.  The BTC protocol is fine if you know how to use it.  MtGox fucked up.  The end.
Enjoy the rest of your thread.

It's a crypto currency. Full stop. No need to inject personal politics. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:00:34
This is not pedantic. Mt Gox is officially still around and officially dragging BTC through the mud. The word "official" here seems highly important.

(I disagree, a vote for this guy is a step backward)

This is not correct. Once a single major economy moved to dynamic currency the rest of the world was required to follow along or be exposed to trade manipulation. The argument to use fiat was to provide a pressure valve for nations to control wild fluctuations. The efficacy is debatable but the founding concepts were not simple "hurr let's be an empire."

From voting based solely on Bitcoin stance to anti-vax debate, this sub has everything a moron needs. 
Edit: did you even read your own link? Casual correlation exists but was refuted by additional studies. Keep spreading that fear, buddy!

Jesus this subreddit sucks.

I don't think a "beta" sticker is appropriate for Bitcoin.  Just because something CAN be developed further doesn't mean it isn't "finished."
As for the specific question, theorectically Bitcoin can process 5-10 transactions per second ([source](  Whether that is enough to support widespread adoption is an interesting debate.

Meth is really, really bad stuff. Let's not compare it to reefer madness.

Good point. Upvoted.

Are we doing this bullshit debate again?
Some cultures use low wage + tips, some cultures don't.  If you're in a culture that tips, you should tip as well.

Odd experience so far.  Last night I created a Bitinstance transaction as a guest with no problem.  I created a second transaction 30 minutes later and "guest" is not an option so... ok, I'll create an account, but then the (required) email verification arrives and the verification link in it goes to a broken web page ("internal server error").
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:23:29
No one seems to discuss this much but the architecture speed of Bitcoin cannot support all the world's transactions. Is Litecoin any better?
