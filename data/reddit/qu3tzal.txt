Things like this will help to strengthen BTC. Way to go...

The new web is coming along nicely.

Ouch... the "catch".
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:07:35
Totally possible **because** centralized.

But for "money", yes.

It just strikes me strange that in a supposedly free country you have to ask permission to use the water.

This is some of the best news that I have heard in a while for Bitcoin and for Vertcoin. Vertcoin has a service made for it called "Vertverser" that allows you to pay directly for anything in Vertcoin that has a Bitcoin address. Nice...
Vertverser here at Reddit:
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:52:27
True. But the centralisation that has occured with Bitcoin at Mt.Gox has produced much of the same effect.

It is enlightening to know that Apple will be using their resources to ultimately fail.
@_date: 2014-09-05 02:18:28
It has already been thought of. PM me.
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:00:39
I see these features as redundant and included in the BTC software and blockchain. If some feature is missing, it can be added.
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:13:13
I am getting more confident that BTC will make it to 2016 and enjoy another halving of the reward. If it does, 
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:29:36
The reward halving occurs again in 2016. The price jumped to the moon last time that happened. Two years - is that "long term"?
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:30:33
Thanks. Good luck with it.
@_date: 2014-01-17 03:01:47
Someone did, and now its gone.
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:17:33
It is also good to explain that BTC is safer to use than their debit/credit card, thanks to encryption.

Please clue in us ignorant ones on *MigMogoMing*.
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:17:48
The evidence that it will never fail does not exist. But the price fell right around the time Mt Gox failed. The site had at one time handled perhaps 80 percent of buying and selling bitcoin. This centralisation of bitcoin is/was the enemy of all decentralised currencies like bitcoin.
If bitcoin survives to 2016, it will probably go up in price, thanks to the "reward halving" in that year.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:09:55
You are right to feel that way. The centralization that happened with BTC may end up killing it. It is time for "cryptocurrency 2.0."
@_date: 2014-08-24 17:02:24
An open source solution similar to imgur? Just thinking out loud here.

$2.50 or so per transaction for the bank as well.

I am thinking a Raspberry Pi may suffice.

That cost is going down now as solar and other types of free and nearly-free electricity are taking hold.

Unless it was physically damaged, it is possible to get the data back. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 22:07:22
Hackers, in the negative sense, choose the program where they can do the most damage with the least amount of work. It use to be Internet Explorer when it was the most popular browser.
Linux is now the most popular operating system on the planet, thanks to Android using it.

Not only is it falling, it is falling
That is a bad sign. The centralization of this coin that was designed to be decentralized was/is the problem
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:38:13
That would be true progress then.
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:15:19

It is covered by the Law of the Diffusion of Innovation:

True, but the difference appears so small as to not warrant going there from the USA.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:43:16
I had to laugh at that title, but unfortunately, it rings fairly true.
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:44:28
I have to agree with you. Bitcoin, if it survives its centralisation problems, will not be $350,000 in 2016. Looking back at the last reward drop in 2013, the price was $120 on 6/6/2013.
During the rise in November up to $1226, that created a multiple of around ten. Unless something big happens, a multiple of ten on today's price would create a price of around $5000 dollars in 2016.
Bitcoin would still be a great investment. I hope it holds out.

Working with his ISP, they can see what pages in the blockchain he is accessing. He would probably be checking his own wallet. The wallet ID number is in the URL. It would then become "probable cause".

The early adopters, in this case, win again.

Even if it was, which Ponzi scheme would you prefer? Would you want one run by a small group of power-hungry bureaucrats or one run on an unbreakable, worldwide network of "every day people"?

The more the merrier. Let's give the world whatever it wants in the way of any valid decentralized money source. If you like BTC, great. If you like LTC, great. If you like....etc.

Dont worry, Ripple is not a competitor.

Rescuing? [Bwahahaaa](
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:08:36
These are wise words, and I would only add to them the "law of the diffusion of innovation". When a new technology is introduced with success, the first 2.5 percent are innovators, then we have the early adopters, the early majority and the late majority. 
Last come the "laggards". The laggards only adopt the new technology (if it is actually still "new") because their old stuff no longer exists or works anymore.
We are still in the late first (innovation) or early second stage (early adopters) with Bitcoin. The sky is still the limit if Bitcoin eventually becomes an established technology.

You made me think that an electric company is the number one business to start up a bitcoin mining operation. It would be an automatic investment.

Good. Go away please.

They will not be investing in them at that time, they will be using them as money. They also may want to own one as a store of value, like gold.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:35:48
Or buy 51% of all the bitcoins that will be in existence (21 million).
