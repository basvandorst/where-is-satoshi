Take a look at [this post]( -- it was very helpful for me. I read a few other guides and settled on [a process that worked for me]( 
Briefly, I used offline live-OS (TAILS) + bitaddress.org and a passphrase to generate ~10 BIP38 encrypted private keys (blue) and ~5 keys in cleartext (yellow). Then I printed the paper wallets, and used transparent packing tape to waterproof the BIP38s. 
I treat the blue ones like bank accounts, and the yellow ones like cash. When I run out of cash, I go back to TAILS offline, decrypt a BIP38 to get its blue key, scan to phone (mycelium), withdraw some cash to a yellow address, and send the remainder to an unused blue address. My passphrase disappears with the live-OS, so I don't worry about the physical security of the blue wallets. Also, I don't worry about malware on my phone because I don't reuse the blue keys.
There are still limitations. I'm not using change addresses correctly and my coins die with me if I get hit by a bus. I'd like to switch to an air-gapped raspberry pi + armory and shatter the seed with shamir's secret sharing.

Where do you trade? Laws differ by region. 
But, more importantly, have you ever watched breaking bad or read the biography of an fbi agent undercover on a money-laundering case? Learn about the people to whom you're providing financial services. A few coins here and there to privacy-conscious persons is no big deal. Just ask questions before you trade in extraordinary volumes. What is the source of the cash? Why aren't they getting the coins from an exchange where they are cheaper? If, after that, you can sell with an empathetic and clear conscience, the question of legality is of secondary importance.
Prosecutions tend to fall on those who knowingly sell to bad guys, get in trouble for other reasons, and/or fail to pay taxes.

1) Right, the miners own the power, but enforcing physical distributing of hashpower can only help decentralization. I don't know the extent to which it may help. Do you? For example, it may deter 22nmMiningCorpX from using the latest batch of devices to mine for BTC before selling to the customer. Like how there are limitations on an entity owning all the types of media in a location (print, cable, etc.), there could be limits on the amount of mining that 22nmMiningCorpX may do.
2) I'm drawing an analogy between financial and electrical "wires." In the financial network graph, nodes are entities (persons) and money flows between nodes along the edges (wires). The U.S. treasury monitors these flows for irregular or suspicious volume/activity in order to weed out bad actors.
3) in the same way that the U.S. treasury monitors the financial wires, a regulator of bitcoin could monitor electrical wires for irregular or suspicious consumption of power to weed out physically centralized mining.
The U.S. treasury can trace the flows of money with incredible precision because of all the KYC/AML rules. If a similar precision were applied to electrical power consumption, then we might be able to enforce decentralization of hashpower. We don't know which device is plugged into the wall, but a regulator could know the intended use of a facility, and justify consumption of power with random site visits, etc.

Payment processors could allow multiple payment addresses for a single purchase. You'd pay a separate transaction fee for each unspent output, but at least you wouldn't have to explicitly link the coins. Eventually the systems will improve if there is demand.

Why not just put the key into a deposit box? If I doubted my self-discipline I might shard the key with ["m-of-n" shamir's secret sharing]( Destroy the original, send the shards to my friends/family. Tell each shard-holder to not return the shard to me under any circumstance until 2019. For example, you could send 10 shards, and require a minimum of 5 to reconstitute the key.
This would be like giving 10 (n) keys to top members of the military, and making a machine that would only launch the missiles if 5 (m) people inserted and turned their keys at the same time. 5 of the key-holders could die our lose their keys, but you could still fire the missiles, and 5 of them would all have to betray you to fire without authorization. 
Choose m and n carefully, train the shard-holders, and do the sharding offline. 
Still risky, and a bit silly, but fun to think about.

If it's trivial to get up-front discounts at a popular merchant by paying in bitcoin (e.g. coinforcoffee), you just need to film people experiencing it for the first time. 
Tricky part would be the mechanics of it. Maybe a sign outside the store saying, would you like to buy this &lt;coffee&gt; with bitcoin? If someone approaches you, probably just give them the bitcoin, and ask them to imagine the bitcoins are in the bank, and their phone wallet is the associated debit card. Then spend a minute with them to get the gift card, and send them in.
Then interview them on their way out the door, and determine their annual savings with bitcoin. Maybe ask them if they want to send the amount they just saved to a charity. Could generate the charity payment barcode on the spot. Then wait for them to ask, how do I get more bitcoins? Then cut to the thechoiceisyours.org, or whatever, where people go for more information. 
Maybe not what you're looking for though. Good luck!

You're essentially looking for lightweight two-factor authentication (2FA) for an HD wallet, right? I'm with you, because I fear using the seed--it feels like a single point of failure. 
In the linked thread, suggested that I use something like [passguardian]( to split the seed into multiple shares. One must then combine some subset of the shares in order to reconstruct the original seed. 
That would be form of 2FA and you could share the pieces (shards) with yourself (one on phone, another in wallet, etc.), and combine them only when spending coin. You would need a wallet that supported this, and then the seed would only exist on the device long enough to spend coins. 
There's probably an HD wallet out there somewhere that would be willing to be a watch-only wallet with transient private keys, but I don't know of one. I'm not sure whether electrum/armory encrypts the private keys with your passphrase. Perhaps one of the existing HD wallets would be sufficient for you since most of them require a secret (passphrase, pin, etc.) in addition to the seed.
Also, I think I'm at the limits of my understanding of bitcoin by even thinking about it this way. I want to understand the various constraints better, because I feel like I'm running in circles sometimes.

So, the 0.001 BTC arrived, and your wallet knows it is there, and you can spend it, but if you want to send more BTC to HD Wallet, use the next public address (15D...BP4). This is one of the features of HD to minimize address re-use. Re-using addresses can reduce your privacy and is generally discouraged.
"Account 2" is a new HD wallet, with its own series of keys, the first of which is 1GV...M1N. So, you tried to create a new address from the seed for "HD Wallet," but you actually made an entirely new wallet and seed. "HD Wallet" automatically shows the second public key, and you can see the previous address by selecting "HD Wallet," hitting the light blue stack of squares next to "ARCHIVE" in the upper-right, and selecting, "Show Unspent Outputs." I hope I got this right. I'm still learning my way around it too.

Do you know the definition of a currency? Limited/controlled supply is arguably the most important facet to the value of a currency. In bitcoin, the supply over time is known and fixed. Fiat is backed by the full faith and credit of the government...in which less belief abounds these days:
For example, the U.S.
* debt lost AAA status
* debt ceiling debate threatened to put the US in default on its loans
* quantitative easing is purposeful dilution of the value of the US dollar by unelected representatives of private banks--do they have my best interests in mind, really?
The choice is yours. Why not diversify? Consider the potential downside and upside and their relative probabilities in your mind. That will help you decide how much to invest, if that is your intention. Otherwise, debate away, I guess.
But here's a question: why couldn't the bitcoin devs just up and say, ok, forget 21 million. Let's make it 42 million, just for fun?

Thanks for your post! I love BIP38-protected wallets. I used them a lot at first. Ultimately, though, the effort required to keep generating them, plus lack of support for change addresses made me move to electrum and HD wallets. 
However, I miss frictionlessly switching between independent wallets with BIP38. Figure out a way to combine the benefits of both approaches, plus some multi-sig, and you've got something to which I would probably switch. 
I have "functional specs" combining the independent addresses and 2FA of BIP38 + infinite addresses of HD, but I'm not sure which wallet devs would be interested, or whether there's already a BIP for that.

I can imagine some pairs would have negative fees because bitcoins are in higher demand in exchange for some fiats over others (USA-&gt;Argentina). I hope I'm communicating clearly.

I don't know how much this will cost.

In my experience with a personal account, coinbase charges 1% + 15 cents per transaction, which would be 2% + 30 cents round-trip. That would mean a savings of 0.9% per transaction. Any savings adds up, folks. 
I like OP's idea, even if it seems awkward at first. It would drive up the volume on exchanges, offer liquidity, and create a more balanced number of bids and asks. In turn, prices may stabilize making bitcoin a more attractive store of value.

[It looks like a Finney is currently set to 1e-7 BTC, or 10 satoshis.]( But I don't believe it is a widely used denomination, so there would be little harm in repurposing it for 1e-6 BTC (uBTC, pronounced "yu-but", aka "bit" &lt;sigh&gt;). If Canada can have loonies and toonies, surely bitcoin may have Finneys.
It would be simple enough to refer to an "old Finney" in the rare instances that one might need to reference the previous usage. The "old" prefix is also needed for other currencies.
If anyone wants to make this happen, just set up the denomination in changetip and start tipping people with Finneys. Not sure if it's already taken.
EDIT: well, here goes nothing 100 Finneys
EDIT2: introduced the Finney as 1e-7 BTC [3 months ago]( and there did not seem to be consensus.
EDIT3: well, in thread, it looks like two people successfully tipped finneys as 1e-7, but in its current form, the "old finney" hasn't proved very useful, and changetip did not complain about a collision. Perhaps a Finney as 100 satoshis would be more useful.

I found out about bitcoin in 2011 through my contributions to an open source gnu-sponsored project. The lead devs would tease each other about using bitcoin for various jobs in real life, but it was all tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. Curious, I checked out the technology and wanted to get some coins, but all the exchanges seemed so sketchy. I stumbled upon casascius coins, and wanted to get two of them for Christmas. One for me, and one for my friend, but two 25 BTC coins cost around $100, and I couldn't afford them on my graduate student salary. fml

Thanks for this thread. These kinds of conversations are why I keep reading &gt; Because quantum computers can easily decrypt the private key using the public key, anyone with a quantum computer can extract Bitcoins using the corresponding public key
This is one of the reasons why address re-use is not recommended. The public key for an address is only revealed upon first spend. IIRC, deriving the public key solely from the address would be "hard" for quantum computers, but I don't remember why.

Oh fun! Let me try. 
Given a random stream of bits that was impossible to predict, but agreed upon by local miners, reject blocks that do not include a valid bitstream. The probability of getting scooped by a cooperation between external hashpower and an internal node would be a function of the speed of light, distance between the attackers, and length of a valid bitstream.

Yeah, when I tried to get my Dad into bitcoin he asked a few key questions that I could not answer, which made me hit the bitcoin books again. Over time I believe I addressed most if not all of them, but I wish he was still alive to have those conversations again. He rapidly deteriorated and died from metastatic colon cancer during bitcoin's meteoric rise last year. He helped me learn that relationships are the best stores of value. Thanks, Dad! Yay for Dads!
Localized rapid economic expansion and contraction may be a thing of the past. 
Centralized banking policy addresses rapidly changing needs for currency over time and space. These dynamics are partially a factor of the real-world maximum velocities of stores of value. Now the world is so much more connected by efficient transfers of information, goods, and services. Perhaps these flows enabled a global equilibrium, which required a new form of currency with its own advantages and disadvantages, many of which are yet to be discovered. Local currencies will still serve their purposes during periods of electrical outages.

Now you just need to find someone in the other countries trying to send money to thailand. Thai's working abroad need to send money home.

For example, there was someone here recently named Elyse (?) that imports tea from foreign markets (e.g. Thailand) to the U.S., and wanted to pay her tea farmers in bitcoin to avoid fees. She needed people like you to provide domestic currency to the tea growers in exchange for their bitcoin wages.

[Metcalfe's law]( vs. [ponzi scheme](
A ponzi scheme has but is not limited to the following characteristics: 1) The number of participants must grow exponentially in order to sustain the expected return on investment, and 2) the last person to join the pyramid loses his investment.
A bitcoin maintains its intrinsic -- though not its speculative -- value at any constant size of the network, and the last person to adopt bitcoin will retain the intrinsic value of his investment. The flow of value in a ponzi scheme is uni-directional, whereas the edges of the Bitcoin graph support the flow of value bi-directionally.
To the uninitiated (a group to which I belonged in 2011), the transfer of fiat for bitcoin feels like a ponzi scheme because, in joining a small network, the value proposition is heavily weighted in favor of the previous adopters. This is where the similarities end. In the case of Bitcoin, the wise decision was to join anyway because of the vast speculative value which may or may not ever be fully realized.

I read the docs differently. [Bullet (4) of the FinCEN guidance]( defines an MSB as a "Seller or redeemer of ... store of value." Perhaps reasonable persons would disagree, but I treat a bitcoin as a store of value, therefore the threshold of 1k/day applies.

In theory, you could identify the zeroith broadcasting ip if you had the logs from all the nodes, but if the attacker used a web wallet then you would only get the ip of the wallet, and would still need access to wallet's logs to see the attacker's ip...and even then it might be a tor exit node...fuck

Careful: if all the buys and sells are going through one exchange (i.e. coinbase), then you're actually reducing trade volume because intra-exchange transactions happen off the blockchain. Lower volume would increase volatility in BTC/USD. That's good if there is a net inflow of fiat into the bitcoin economy, but eventually the strategy will backfire unless more exchanges are involved.

The notion that Bitcoin is *currently* unregulated is a myth, perhaps intentionally propagated by those who have the most to lose.

So 80,000 tx/sec would be 8,000 * 1MB = 8 GB (8,000,000,000 byte) blocks. If peak tx rates were sustained over a year, -- extremely unlikely, but let's allow for growth -- that would be 8 GB /10min * 6 /hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/yr = 420 TB/year added to the blockchain. I've seen organizations burn through that much storage in 6 months or less.
If you're worried about network transfer rates, then 8 GB / 10 min is doable with a [156 million bits/sec (Mbps) connection]( less than a hobbyist would get over a [$70/mo fiber (1,000 Mbps) connection](
On the storage side, I imagine money will flock to fix any pain points. I hear finance is big business these days.

Very helpful. Is there a way to reduce risk that patients will receive an impure/wrong remedy? Are you suggesting the physician deliver pharmaceuticals directly to the patients? How risky would it be for a physician to participate in such a thing? How to mitigate the risk?

In addition to the other methods mentioned in the thread, I recommend BitQuick. I just sold my first coins through them yesterday. How much do you need? If it's a relatively small amount (&lt;1000 USD), then I imagine you won't need ID.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:16:38
best to try a few different ones with small amounts and then pick a favorite. I  recommend mycelium.

Maybe you could find a way to piggyback on an existing reputation system, like [Bitrated]( That would be awesome. No need to invent your own system. Bitrated could check the signature of a message signed with the key associated with the localtrader account. The process already works for bitcoin-OTC. Mycelium could get the Bitrated ID for the user, and link to the profile from localtrader.

Using bitcoin is the best way to get consumers to want to pay by bitcoin, so offer discounts for paying by bitcoin, and consider offering bitcoin to customers that pay full price. You'll attract customers who only have USD to spend, and then encourage them to use your store again in the future.

Reasonable people may disagree about the first bits. How much you're willing to lose is up to you. 
Tell your dad what you're thinking as you go, but don't expect him to agree with you or throw more of his money at your favorite investment opportunity. He sounds alright. My dad gave me a similar amount to invest when I was about your age. I wish I'd approached the opportunity as inquisitively as you.

Makes sense to me. Do it like twitter's "check mark." I believe the threshold for the check mark is the check-ee alerting mods to malicious and potentially harmful attempts at false represention.

Yeah, decentralization seems impossible without a lot of IRL interactions between miners, but the current "potential zooz" mining is a fun experiment because the community owns the movement data, which is valuable on its own.

If nothing else, it's opened my eyes to the importance of running bitcoind over tor, and the privacy issues with SPV, which previously I'd heard about but tried to ignore. At the same time I still love mycelium. [They are fully engaged with the community on this issue](

Multisig would only require trust in a third party in case of a dispute. If buyer and seller trade fairly, then there is no need for the third party to do anything.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:07:44
What's the problem, exactly? If you'd rather transact with fewer questions, then there are options for you like localbitcoins or mycelium localtrader. If you're connected to legacy financial institutions, then you play by their rules.

limited downside and unlimited upside--that's what you're looking for. See which investment opportunities match this profile most closely. What's the lowest bitcoin could go? What's the highest it could go? Figure out what would have to happen for prices to move in either direction. How likely are those things to happen? How much are you willing to lose in order to get exposure to the upside? Good luck!

What would stop a company from ignoring the bitlicense and complying with existing regulations instead? Maybe the big players are confident they could overturn in court any fines that Lawsky or his ilk tried to impose. If that's the case, the bitlicense is DOA.

I applaud you for running your business. If you demonstrate compliance with existing regulations, no one will come after you. If anyone tries to fine your business, I bet you could crowd-fund your expenses to fight it in court. I'd hate to see a law-abiding useful service go under because of the bitlicense, which adds nothing of any value to the regulatory landscape. If there's any question whether you're compliant already, ask FINCEN. They were very responsive when I had questions.
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:25:52
These are good points. 500 bits I tried their android app, and I like it. I believe the app has potential. The community needs more leadership, but no one knows whether it will succeed. It has a major advantage over Bitcoin because miners are supposed to be people moving in cars with empty seats, which is resistant to emulation. The tokens are worthless until the network reaches critical mass, which discourages emulation. When ridership begins, a reputation system could be in place to punish poor behavior. Potential!
