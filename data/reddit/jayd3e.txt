Agreed.  I get the sense that he means well, but he doesn't fully understand the limits of the technology yet.  He has a tendency to oversell.

Don't you get that most people don't care about monetary sovereignty?  People will choose cost and convenience over all other factors every time.  It's only the really hardcore bitcoin crowd that believes this quality of Bitcoin to be the most important piece, and I'm not arguing that it's not important, it is.  But a lot of the people in this community need to start understanding that cost/convenience is how Bitcoin is going to have the ability to gain mass appeal, so we can all use it to buy groceries one day.  Keeping fees low is incredibly important, it is one of the biggest differentiating factors of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:49:13
Yeah this is always infuriating, and adds insult to injury.  I like to keep my money in a few different accounts for organization purposes and so I don't spend as much from my checking.  On a few occasions I've over-drafted for only a few cents and been charged 35.00 for it.  It's insane that such a small error can amount to that kind of penalty.  I always call in and get them removed.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:39:46
Do you know what methods of determining block size we have at our disposal?  And how they are susceptible to exploitation?
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:24:49
I'm beside myself with shock that Voat actually got so much attention.  Reddit is the obviously superior product.  Their core value of increased security is something Reddit holds near and dear.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:01:26
I know this tends to be a really unpopular belief, but this is why services like coinbase are so important.  Cloud storage is a HUGE relief when it comes to feeling safe about your money.  I can lose my phone, drop my laptop off a high rise, get punched in the face and have my phone stolen(actually happened), etc and I still have my money.  The concept of "a cloud" is one of the largest innovations of then 21st century, let's not forget that.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:54:27
That's what I said, no?  I'm merely bringing up the fact that the blockchain diverging into two separate forks would be disastrous for the ecosystem.  Bitcoin is in its infancy and we need everyone running the same software, protocol, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:17:47
Good advice.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:57:02
Sure thing.
@_date: 2015-06-12 21:37:02
But this isn't a compromise.  It mimics the way other facets of the system already work.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:58:53
The reason why bitcoiners tend to steer away from the idea that Bitcoin should be used as an investment is b/c if everyone did that, it would get in the way of Bitcoin functioning as an actual currency, and it would be condemned to a store of value.  Yes, it's very plausible that Bitcoin will increase in value over time.  But in order to see that reality, we need to keep our heads on what matters right now, which is making Bitcoin usable for day to day purposes and becoming a real widely accepted currency.  The tech is working, we just need to iron out the social issues around it, priority  being usage.  So imo it's better to shine light on what Bitcoin can actually be used for and why it's better than conventional currency, as opposed to treating it like a stock.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:56:04
I agreed with you until you said


If "running the code they want" results in a hard fork scenario where a new parallel blockchain is created, this is NOT a scenario that we could survive.  That would result in absolute chaos, where people's money would technically exist as two different amounts.  The power of Bitcoin comes from everyone agreeing to run the same software.  If we were to create a scenario where the software was configurable and allowed people to make changes without forcing a hard fork, what you're saying might be a good avenue.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:34:01
It's an idealist viewpoint for Greece to lose faith in their own currency and switch over to to BTC.  Realistically speaking, yes it an impossibility.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:40:11
Awesome, thanks for replying!
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:50:01
The title says it clearly, I'm making sure that everyone has heard it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:12:01
I wrote this in the comments, but I'll restate it as a post.  People can talk as much as they want about using a wallet with a passphrase and writing it down in a few safe places.  The fact of the matter is that a normal person will not be able to do this.  It's easy for anyone who is tech savvy, but to the normal consumer, this much complexity in handling their money is not possible.  
Imo this is why services like Coinbase and Circle are so important.  Cloud storage is one of the most important innovations of the 21st century yet.  Why would we waste this power.  I got punched in the face and had my phone stolen.  The fact that I use Coinbase is what single-handedly stopped me from losing a large sum of money in Bitcoin.  I was already irate about, you know, getting punched in the face.  Now imagine if I lost thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to boot.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:35:14
That's correct, he is spending the majority of his time on that proposal from what I've heard.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:19:51
I semi-agree with his take on this, but it's so easy for people to get around.  Every time you spend Bitcoin, you just buy the same amount of Bitcoin that you spent with USD.  It's like paying for something for the value of USD, but with the convenience of BTC.  I'm surprised more people don't get that this is an option.  Coinbase even has a feature that does this for you.  Once more people realize this and we have more merchants selling things people need in Bitcoin, his argument will be easily countered.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:58:05
Yeah just some kind of insurance that I'm not going to lose all of my coin.  There are only a few systems I actually trust enough to hold it, so I'm always wary to transfer it to any other system.  This is assuming you are using a service to generate and manage your wallet for you.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:56:34
Ideally by 2020, there will be enough merchants that accept bitcoin, that you won't need to move any coin.  You can simply reap the rewards of the increased value by buying things in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:17:33
Haha my girlfriend has put up a little bit of resistance in the past when I've bought bitcoins, but after explaining everything to her, she is far more receptive.  It's hard to get behind bitcoin until you see it's true power/value.  It's getting easier and easier for the consumer to understand it.
@_date: 2015-06-12 21:36:08
This.  1,000 times this.  The more I think about it the more a dynamic block size limit makes sense.  Bitcoin was architected to be a very elastic system, changing as it expands.  This decision follows suit with that ethos.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:59
Came here to say this.  Thank you for speaking up!
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:36:56
I would definitely agree, but if you sit on your hands for just long enough, it will reveal to you the largest of your problems.  It makes prioritization easier, and gives you enough information to plan out the next 1-2 month rock to hit.
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:00:56
As an engineer myself, I wholeheartedly agree.  Sometimes the best route with complex software is to sit on your hands until you really understand how to fix it.  Especially if the software is working well for a lot of people.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:17:20
The mining difficulty is determined by the amount of completed blocks, apparently around every 2016 blocks.  So basically the system uses time to determine the hashrate difficulty.  A similar mechanism could be used for block size, and the discussion would then be around the rate at which it needs to increase and the max acceptable block size for all time.  Both of which could be changed in the future after some experimentation, no?
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:48:05
What's with the coinbase hate? They are providing the single easiest way to buy/sell bitcoins atm and have been for years.  I don't understand this mindset of putting down the most influential company in Bitcoin just b/c its centralized.  Normal people want centralization in the utilities they use.  What's the point in making a decentralized gmail!?!?  Coinbase hitting 2.3 million users is a win for the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:06:33
I totally agree that individuals running different versions of Bitcoin wouldn't be a huge deal, as long as it's done in such a way that doesn't result in a hard fork of the system.  My main point is that a hard fork-like scenario resulting in two competing block chains would be a disastrous scenario for the ecosystem.  It would cause a lot of people to lose faith, and more importantly, correct me if I'm wrong but everyone's addresses would contain two different  distinct values.  Or more depending on how many forks are competing.
The issues with people not agreeing on a single implementation have larger social repercussions then technical at the end of the day.  Sure the system might be able to handle it, but the ecosystem would get rocked, which is why we need to avoid it.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:07:50
That's kind of a mess to read, but it doesn't read like a narrative if I bullet it. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:22:04
I agree, I guess I was more so talking about the notion that we should focus on Bitcoin being a store of value.  B/c arguably that is what is getting the most focus from early adopters.  I want more focus to shift towards the buying/selling of goods and services with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:22:28
Seriously, that was my first thought too.  I have some coin that I'd love to gain some interest on, but unless I know that you have some serious security infrastructure(physically store public addresses pretty much), then I would be very hesitant to put them anywhere else besides where they are.
@_date: 2015-06-27 04:31:01
No prob, yeah I really enjoyed it as well and thought it said volumes about the two sides of the discussion.
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:40:58
He said "clearly", so I would assume so XD.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:47:03
At some point when people start creating credit services in bitcoin, people will still be able to spend money they don't have.  This is inevitable, cash and debt will always exist.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:49:25
$35.00 for a going over a few cents....doesn't seem fair and isn't good user experience imo.  I'm sure such services will pop with Bitcoin as well, allowing people to overdraft for a fee. My point is that that service will be a smaller value add service as opposed to an entire institution that has you locked in already b/c they are storing all of your money.  Yes, the bank has every right to do it.  That's not my point.  My point is that the bank nickels and times your money away incredibly effectively, and I prefer the horizon that Bitcoin could potentially unfold.  One where you have more choice in how your money is managed.
@_date: 2015-06-27 04:32:21
Yeah.  The way he said it was totally acceptable though, he was merely saying that naturally the original design of Bitcoin was imperfect, and that it takes iteration to get it right.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:42:17
Just any proposal really.  I would like to read more and hear more discussion about that possibility.  What do you like/dislike about it?
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:17:40
In practice, I've found that anarchists tend to not be grounded in reality enough and too full of sophomoric angst to see the way towards progress.  
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:38:35
You stole the words right out of my mouth!  Thanks for posting this, have wanted to speak about this exact sentiment on every hate-filled coinbase comment on this subreddit.  Coinbase has done so much for Bitcoin, and it's about time they get some recognition.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:15:23
Well that's why I posted :)
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:31:13
My comment was sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:16:42
Awesome.  It’s such a fun/informative video.  I’m sure a number of people on this sub haven’t seen it before.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:06:31
This is really cool. DNS for bitcoin in some respects?  My question is, this is implemented on the application side right?  So if I'm a BitAlias-supporting application, I allow my customers to input a BitAlias and then find their public key on the blockchain?  I'm also unsure of how the public key is actually derived.  We send special metadata with a certain transaction that registers/transfers/extends an alias, and then in order to find all of a user's aliases, we search through the blockchain for all of these pieces of metadata?  Would this be done by the application itself or would it be standardized likely by a library of some kind?  Lastly, how would you expect a UI implementing BitAlias to look like?  Is it possible to have a search of all BitAlias users, then select the one that you want?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:10:22
Yeah he is.  But he is basically saying that Satoshi was wrong about his original vision, that the block size would have no limit and would grow as the system grows.
@_date: 2014-09-03 22:42:49
Haha this is an epic trick, especially helpful for videos like this.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:30:15
The point at 1:29 in the video is a really common Bitcoin meme for a price increase.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:29:40
Exciting!  Will have to stop by soon.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:09:04
See idk.  I definitely gained much more respect for Peter after hearing this discussion, as I had only heard negative things previous to this.  I think everyone has come to the conclusion that a block size increase will happen at some point.  The question is when.   Gavin knows that this change will take 6-12 months to complete and believes that we will see a transaction increase that necessitates the block size increase within that timeframe.  Peter Todd believes that we don't have anything to worry about right this instant, and will be able to handle t when we get to that point.  I would agree with Gavin that such a transaction increase could very well happen in the next year and it would be good for Bitcoin if it did, so why not plan for that and be ready.
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:58:44
Bitcoin is at a different layer than a product like Venmo.  A Venmo could very easily be built on top of Bitcoin.  They are not competitive.  Bitcoin is competing with the traditional banking rails that Venmo is built on.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:44:45
How much would it cost to install and operate for a year?
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:38:07
Can we get details on how much and how to do it?   If we understood how much it costs for a single one in an airport, we could start working towards that.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:22:22
Why do you say that?  What about it?  I thought it did a decent job of explaining the basics of inflation and fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:28:44
So one thing I've always been curious about is this.  The software that all of these blockchain applications have to be distributed to everyone, correct?  So when they are accessing the Dark Market web application in their browser, they are actually just accessing an application that is being served locally, correct?  B/c if that application was served remotely, it would obviously defeat the purpose of having a distributed system.  Or can the web application be hosted remotely, b/c as long as the actually storing mechanism for identities and such is on a separate blockchain, then where the web application is served from becomes insignificant.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:54:07
In the long haul, if this isn't fixed at a protocol level to discourage mining pools of this size then it will simply happen again.  You can't possibly expect miners to move pools solely based on ideological reasons.
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:48:35
That didn't take long :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:21:34
Like what kind of policies?  Just policies against exchange of illegal material?
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:14:29
Yeah that's a really good point, the fact that ebay likely won't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:45:48
It would lose money for a while, but the idea is that at some point it would become profitable if the whole ecosystem works out.  I'm willing to take a gamble if we can get some like-minded people on board.

Do not end your life over this.  This is a bump in the road, but it's not the end.  Life is full of possibility.  Please consider receiving some professional help or reach out to a hotline.  Bitcoin is just getting started.  Start anew, take things day by day, and you can begin to re-invest.  This time with a more reputable exchange.  The owners of Igot are conmen, and you shouldn't have to lose your life b/c they have no ethical standards of their own.
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:14:46
This is the one comment in the thread that made me reconsider my argument.  The government having a blank cheque does create a lot of corruption in the system.  I think bitcoin could curb this problem quite a bit.  What I was arguing though stems from Ray Dalio's interpretation of the economy found in [this video](  There are two forms of assets, cash(or money) and debt.  It's in human nature to take a risk using money you don't necessarily have.  That's exactly how the debt crisis began, and changing the underlying financial infrastructure probably won't change that.  I believe bitcoin is going to change the speed, ease, and cost of moving and storing money.  But I believe the jury is still out on if it will change the higher level social constructs built on top of money.
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:03:33
My opinion is based off of the description of the economy laid out by Ray Dalio(hedge fund manager of Bridgewater, one of the largest hedge funds in the world) in [this video](  A commodity is another form of cash or money as described in the video.
@_date: 2016-01-01 23:40:33
This is a really goofy post.  There are two types of assets, cash and debt.  Yes, bitcoin is a new form of cash.  No, it won't eliminate the concept of debt.  It's silly to think otherwise imo.
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:56:54
You don't have to, but humans naturally do.  My point is that bitcoin doesn't change that reality like people think it does. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 19:05:31
I totally agree with this.  And I think that bitcoin will create a stronger foundation for the world economy, but it won't stop people from making outlandish bets on the economy and the government subsequently bailing those people out.
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:36:58


I would like to remind you to not be so quick to judge all of Islam based on the ruling of a single religious leader in Egypt. I myself know many Egyptians that are very much pro-cryptocurrency and are also religious.  The concept of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually follow the values of Islamic finance very well, as the technology does not involve usury or credit. I encourage people to actually look into the conversation going on around this topic, whether you are religious or not, Islamic finance actually has some very cool, no-nonsense tenants.

I agree.  Let's not do this.  I'm personally excited to see the day when the protocol and economics of Bitcoin are discussed as much as the early days of this sub.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:52:06
I was distraught by the post from earlier, so thanks for clearing this up!  I think that fees are going to need to get progressively lower in order to achieve massive adoption, but for an early technology that still has a lot of issues to work through, I think you showed that we're at a place that we can build on.
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:43:23
I learned nothing from your troll-like comments, which have little substance and a lot of noise.  I was speaking to @_date: 2017-08-18 21:59:01
This has honestly been blown WAY out of proportion.  BitPay chose to run software that they have been supporting and they believe is best for themselves and their users.  They have the right to choose which software they're running. They weren't trying to trick anyone or being malevolent. There is really no need for people to start a holy war.  And yet it's happening.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:33:04
What's the activation mechanism of Segwit2x?  Is it hash power or the number of nodes signaling for the upgrade?
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:32:02
Independent of the election, it's so cool that Bitcoin makes it so easy to make this kind online event possible.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:07:18
Usually that's not the way it works.  Usually the funds never leave the address.  The private key is just moved into the hot wallet system, as opposed to being stored in cold storage.  Sometimes it works like you're claiming though, but there is a whole procedure around it.  It has to be done on a secure computer, you likely want to do a test transaction beforehand, etc.  I don't know all of the details, I'm more so just bringing up that there are a lot of factors that people wouldn't expect embedded in the process, so money isn't lost.
@_date: 2016-11-17 00:40:56
This is awesome!  Thanks for sharing.  Keyword being "offer", but still very cool that it was talked about at all.
@_date: 2016-11-05 07:29:06
This is my favorite video on economics!  Found it in Tony Robbin's book "Money", which is also very good.
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:10:55
This is really interesting.  Why would KeyVendor buy the keys off of you for 2.0x?  How are they able to resell them for a profit?
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:51:40
It's probably a generous over-estimate to give them time.  Moving millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin from cold-storage to a hot-wallet shouldn't be taken lightly.
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:38:32
Would love to hear more about this.  What websites?  How is it being used mainly?  Does it work pretty well?  What's the user experience like?
@_date: 2016-11-09 00:29:15
As for me, even as a very tech-literate person who works in this industry, I still wouldn't manage the physical security of my life savings.  The only exception to this is if I had significant effort being put forth by myself and other professionals to secure multiple parties money.  In that kind of situation, enough time and care would be spent on the security of the system and I would feel confident that my money was safe.  Putting all of my money on a Trezor and putting it into a safe wouldn't give me the same sense of security.
@_date: 2016-11-08 23:49:15
I would love to agree with you, but managing the physical security of one's money is no simple feat.  There is a reason why we don't store our life savings under our mattresses.  Security is always at odds with convenience.  Storing your life savings on a Trezor stored in your home is just flat out not safe imo.  The next step about that is sharding you private key across multiple locations, and at that point we hit a significant skill level for the user.  
Overall, I think the fact that Bitcoin allows people the option to manage their own security is one of its greatest benefits.  But I'm also a realist in saying that not everyone is going to be able nor willing to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:34:17
Is Segwit2x not designed in such a way that if it does not receive unanimous approval then the hard fork doesn't happen and is therefore identical to a Bitcoin core node?
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:23:08
Whenever I see stuff like this posted on it seriously makes me giddy.  Here is to many more years of seeing gradual adoption of the tech from many disparate parties.  So exciting!

This is something I've always considered, but haven't worried about due to all of the material that has described just how many possible keys there are.  So if such rainbow tables started popping up, would it be possible for us to just improve the cryptographic algorithms that Bitcoin is based on, so more combinations are possible?

This is so incredibly sad.  This was my favorite sub.  So many awesome posts and comments, that taught be how Bitcoin works and the trade offs involved in making decisions within the system.  And now it lies in ruins.  I can only hope it can rebuild itself.

I got a little giddy when I saw this post.  Myself and my partners are extremely focused on the answer to this question, and we have actually been tracking our findings for some time.  The good news is that it is a revolution.  That being said, not a lot of people get to see ground floor.  You pretty much have to be actively searching around for people using Bitcoin(as we are).  Also a lot of people are holding their cards close, b/c everyone knows the changes this technology is going to bring will be huge.  I'll share some of the more interesting ones we have found:
* South African students paying for web hosting in other countries using bitcoin
* Companies in Hong Kong paying their software developers in Vietnam in bitcoin
* Vietnamese paying for computer games, hardware, electronics, etc from China and Singapore in bitcoin
* Someone visiting Egypt lost their wallet on the way. He got his brother to send bitcoin to a local trader, so he could liquidate it for cash. This happened at 1am, where banks and Western Union offices were closed.
* Students in the U.S. buying controlled substances through the Silk Road in 2012.  Same individual used to mine in his college dorm room.
* Students buying fake ids through reddit with bitcoin.  The sellers of the ids only accepted bitcoin as payment.
* India imposes high limits on how much money can be transferred out of the country.  Bitcoin can be used to avoid such limits.
* Syrian refugees in Lebanon using Bitcoin to send money back to families.
* Traveler was able to withdraw PHP in the Phillipines in exchange for Bitcoin after having all of his emergency money stolen.  He was able to do this same day.  A bank wire would have taken 4-5 business days.
* Single mother sex workers using Backpage would buy bitcoin via Bitquick in the states.  They couldn't get bank accounts, so Bitcoin was a way for them to get banked.
* A friend used to buy macarons from a french bakery from the US.
* A friend from Las Vegas used to buy soda from a local vendor when bitcoin was only worth $25 a coin.
* Gamers in Saudi Arabia buying small amounts of Bitcoin to buy games online.
* Fillipino and Pakistani workers sending money back home from various countries where they are working as expats.
* Large companies trying to repatriate funds from foreign subsidiaries
* Recycling company in Europe takes online investments via Bitcoin
* People in countries with poor financial infrastructure, who have a hard time getting VISA cards, will order them from XAPO and back them with bitcoin.
* The girlfriend of an associate was getting her company credit card declined while on a business trip, so he sent a local bitcoiner BTC and he showed up with a duffle bag full of money at his girlfriend’s hotel.
* Bitcoin powers one fifth of the remittances between South Korea and the Phillipines - From Luis Buenaventura’s book Reinventing Remittance
* Fillipino got paid in Bitcoin to test VPN software for a company in Panama
* Gambling companies around the world now accept bitcoin, to provide an easy means of payment and collecting winnings
* Zimbabwe and Venezuela are both having problems with their local currencies, so people are buying bitcoin like mad to be able to hedge against the current system and retain the value of their savings.
* Mass payouts for foreign workforces, which BitPay talks about all the time.
* A company in the U.K. sandbox saw a 50% reduction in cost and an hour settlement on b2b remittance payments from the U.K. to South Africa, mentioned in [a report]( on their financial sandbox.
These are in addition to countless merchants worldwide that accept bitcoin as payment, and people who accept bitcoin has payment for services.  I hope to give a talk on this one day.  There are tons of incredibly creative and interesting use-cases that are happening.  These things just take a lot of time to build, so it goes slower than people have patience for sometimes.
As a side note, as others have said, store of value is also a great use-case for bitcoin.

Great list, some good insight here. I would argue with  though.  I think backing up your public/private key online should be the norm, not the "not recommended" option.  Cloud storage is probably the biggest innovation in the last decade, so it's stilly not to use it to back up our keys.  
RL Story: I was outside of a bar late at night with friends, minding my own business.  Random guy punches me in the face while I'm talking on the phone, steals my phone, and runs off.  I was absolutely livid once I realized that the pictures from the first 10 months of my relationship were on there and weren't backed up.  Now imagine how angry I would have been if I hadn't been using Coinbase, and all of my bitcoins had been stolen along with it.  Cloud storage is important.  You can argue about how to implement it properly, so that the third party can't actually spend your bitcoin(on them), but it's a good thing imo.

I'd totally agree with you, I hate wearing suits, unless it's to a wedding or something.  I'm more of getting at that the bitcoiners that are choosing to do speaking events have to remember that changing someone's opinion is very rarely accomplished through aggression.  Saying


Is kind of a cop out.  If you're taking the time to talk to a group of people, don't you want everyone there to hear what you have to say and potentially be influenced by it?  Or why else are you doing it.  Surely you're not doing it to rub a bunch of people the wrong way.  So I'm just trying to bring up the more empathetic route.  
Who has had probably the largest influence on people outside of the community from speaking events?  I would say Andreas Antonopoulos is up there in that category.  Have you ever seen Andreas take the focus away from bitcoin by wearing such a ridiculous outfit? Nope.  B/c he knows that tact wins arguments, not aggressive outfits.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:02:48
You're acting like only non-technical/naive users would back what Bitcoin XT is trying to do.  There are legitimate reasons why XT would be a good move.  It's just very unclear how any change to Bitcoin would affect it over the long run, so everyone is at a stalemate.  This discussion also cuts to the core of what people want Bitcoin to be in the future, and some see a future where Bitcoin is more of a settlement system and some see a future where Bitcoin can support a much larger amount of transactions and be a global payment system.

Is Whole Foods really expensive compared to other grocery stores?  My friend went shopping there once, and 1.5lbs of chicken costs like $20, whereas it would cost around $12 from most other locations.

I think that most are taking a pragmatic over idealist approach to this subject.  We won't have the technology to make such a rainbow table in at least a couple decades(completely pulling that out of my ass as an example), so we might as well keep moving on the more prominent problems of the technology.

If you actually read my comments, you would notice that I actually don't give a shit about SUITS.  I'm talking about what it takes to influence people.  He took the focus away from what he was trying to communicate and put it on his wardrobe.  It's just a bad model to follow, and I wanted to make sure that people in this sub that go on to do speaking gigs about bitcoin don't follow SUIT.
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:20:23
It really is that easy for a lot of people to BUY bitcoin, once they understand it.  The hurdle is conceptional.  People have trouble understanding what bitcoin is in the first place, and what purpose it solves.  So imo it's more on the education side and less on the "developing new onboarding techniques" side.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:09:31
Interesting philosophical question.  Would a model like this mean that people who are more wealthy have more influence on what gets seen?

Debts are shit? Wat?  There are two integral forms of value in any economy, cash and debt.  Debt is a fundamental part of how an economy works and that will never go away.  Debts allow companies to start, buildings to get built, homes to be bought, etc.  A lot very positive things come from the concept of debt, borrowing money from someone for an immediate use and paying it back over time.  Mismanagement of debt can cause a crisis yes, but that's no reason to throw all debt out the window.  
I would imagine in Bitcoin, debt would be handled in the same way.  You would have some enforcement around the system, that says if someone doesn't pay you back, the police will show up at your door or the lender can take your home.  We don't have such infrastructure now, but it will undoubtedly come.  Unless there is some clever technical way to enforce debt collection.

It also lacks tact, and demonstrates that he isn't even willing to try and work with the very people he is about to attempt to convince.  I wouldn't be surprised if they're all too busy in their own minds deciding what they think about his attire that relatively few even listen to what he has to say.  I'm not hating, I just think that this kind of "fuck the man" sort of attitude isn't what leads to change in peoples' minds.  You have to relate to people, answer their questions, try to sympathize with their way of thinking, and look unthreatening to truly impact what people believe.  I say this having first hand experience wearing ridiculous things(red pants and bow tie) for a cause.  It's just not that effective.

This is an incredibly sane approach to take and I hope all Segwit2x supporters do something similar.  The most important thing is a unified Bitcoin ecosystem, as we already have enough work to do without the in-fighting. Segwit2x got us Segwit, let’s not forget that, but at the same time we will be deciding as a group if it’s the right time for 2MB blocks.  I hope this upcoming decision can be based on the technical decision at hand.

This.  I feel like a lot of people are missing the point here.  15 years ago, people would buy external devices to hook up their laptop to wifi via usb.  This could be the first step in creating an implementation of a board that can get put into any device and connect to the Bitcoin network.

Mostly convenience on install(websites trump everything else in ease of setup, as everyone knows how to visit a website), performance(large websites put tons of effort into making sure your results load fast and you get the best results), and managing updates(it's very hard to get people to update native software, unless you have an auto-update ability).  The convenience is the most important I'd say, I want everyone to be able to use this marketplace, not just bitcoiners.

I take a different mindset from OpenBazaar.  I think centralization brings a lot of added benefits to platforms, especially marketplaces.  We've spent the greater part of the last couple decades figuring out cloud computing/storage, and we didn't do it without a reason.  It's super powerful that Bitcoin itself is decentralized, but not all of the infrastructure on top of it needs to be decentralized.  In fact there are ways to create a hybrid, where a marketplace can still take advantage of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, while taking advantages of all of the benefits that come with a centralized system(convenience for the user, ease of maintenance, speed, etc).  In short, I think marketplaces on top of Bitcoin are much better served as being centralized.

The smaller fees don't equate to 20% though, which is where I get confused.  I'm not complaining, I just don't know how such a large company could afford such a discount.  Unless it's philosophical, which is pretty cool if it is.

Circle providing zero fees on debit/credit card purchases was a marketing stunt, and is by no means practical from a business sense.  Credit/debit cards are costly to support and more susceptible to fraud than other methods of payment, so it's necessary to charge more for fees.
