I think he is just trying to say that it won't be for everybody. He wants something that maybe you or I wouldn't want at all, and he is comparing that to people who want Bitcoin. Some people will never want to use digital currencies. Some people will never have the means to.

As much as we all would like to pretend we are objective thinkers who make decisions based solely on hard evidence and sound reasoning, that's just now how most people draw conclusions and make decisions. Instead, I find that most people will draw conclusions on certain topics within the first few minutes of being introduced to a topic. That initial conclusion can generally be tied directly to experiences, influences, and circumstances unique to that person. They then set out to ask other people for their opinion, or do some research in order to inform themselves about the topic. However, it's my opinion that the only thing this last step generally achieves is reinforcing one's original position. There is usually an abundance of evidence and arguments that can be made for both sides of a controversial topic, and what you choose to read, who you choose to talk and listen to, and the reason why you are interested in the topic in the first place are all going to be heavily influenced by the same subjective things that got them to their first opinion in the first place.
I am no different. I could point you to exactly what circumstances, opinions, and ideologies got me interested in Bitcoin in the first place, and I would be lying if I told you that I made my evaluation of Bitcoin in an objective fashion.
I don't see a thread full of idiots there. I see a thread full of people who's circumstances and opinions did not leave them inclined to have a favorable view of Bitcoin. I see a ton of evidence for their viewpoints. I see a community of people agreeing with their sentiments. 
The mistake is thinking that we are more objective thinkers than we are. The mistake is thinking that the people and comments in this thread are objective thinkers. Likewise, it is a mistake to think that we in r/bitcoin are completely objective thinkers.
EDIT: I wanted to elaborate on my last paragraph because it's pretty weak and doesn't really convey what I was going for. I'm trying to say that I think it's a mistake to be offended by other people's opinions that may disagree with your own, and I think that the frustration derives from thinking that the other person just hasn't been thinking about it right, or isn't informed enough. In reality, people generally have opinions that suit their own situation and values. have you ever had a friend or loved one come to you for advice, and you work really hard to give them a sincere and well thought out opinion, only to have them disregard it completely to continue on the path that they would have chosen anyways? Have you ever had a girlfriend ask you which dress you like more, when she knows exactly which one she is going to pick from the start? It's kind of like that.
**TL;DR** People are going to create narratives that suit their own circumstance and ideologies. There is plenty of evidence out there for any viewpoint you want to take on Bitcoin. Don't let it frustrate you.

Changetip is a pretty pointless, expensive middleman for all of these tipping applications. The one benefit I do see it providing is that you can give people Bitcoin who may not otherwise know how to acquire bitcoin.
As for people who are already bitcoiners, all we need to be able to tip is a public address. Perhaps if reddit would just make it to where when you click on a users name, they can have a public address show up as part of the profile, we could just tip that way using service that bci or your preferred wallet.

Start a tutoring program where people can be tutored for BTC. 
Basically any system where people can buy something practical using their Bitcoin will have an appeal to sellers and buyers alike, because as far as a lot of these people are concerned, they just got $100 of magic internet money, and they would probably pay more than they normally would for services or things, because they don't have all that much value in it.

Guys it is pretty damn obvious the Bill Gates is not throwing support around Bitcoin. He said that it demonstrated how easy it could be to solve the world's money transmitting problems. He said that he would be interested in creating an alternative not associated with money laundering. 
This is the owner of one of the biggest corporations in the world and one of the richest men in the world. The last things this guy would ever do is support a grass roots currency movement that devalues his wealth.

In theory, that is how a market works. In reality, that is not how it works. I think a bitcoin is worth more than $310, but that doesn't mean I will invest everything I have on the market agreeing with me. 
People don't just buy into things until they are broke because they think it's a good investment. At least not smart people.

When resources are abundant it works. Burners do not produce all of the resources there. They buy most of them with money that they have earned, which is fine of course. It is a desert after all. 
I love the idea of a resource pooling, open community of anarchists who thrive through supporting one another, but it all boils down to resources, and there are plenty of people in the world without a lot of access to resources.
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:09:25
Haha ok. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:15:35
Yeah but keep a couple of things in mind:
We know the outcome of water and fire. They have been around long before humans. Therefore, there is a right and wrong opinion indeed. We won't know who is right about Bitcoin for quite some time. In fact, if you were 100% certain that you were already right, you really wouldn't care at all if other people agreed with you or not. You'd just be buying up more and more slowly and keeping hush hush about it.
You have to understand how it looks from the outside of the Bitcoin community when people inside the community take it so personally that they do not agree with them. The act of trying to persuade random people on the internet of how successful Bitcoin will be comes off as very fishy because of the exact reason given in the above paragraph. Why would you be so concerned with selling me on Bitcoin if you are so sure it will be successful? The implied answer to that question is that you want me to buy in so that the value of the coins you own goes up. To uninformed people, this sounds like a scam. 
Arguing for Bitcoin with people who have already made up their minds about it is not only a waste of your energy, but it also makes Bitcoin look bad at the same time.

I'm not arguing that inflation is a good thing.
In your example, your debt just went from $50,000 to a big mac or a paycheck (which for some reason are equivalent in your example).
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:19:09
The goal was never for all of the debt to be paid back. 
That's kind of my point here. People point to our national debt, which a large chunk of is just owed to the federal reserve, as some kind of representation of our country's financial status. All of that debt is in dollars though, and so the actual value of the dollar amount we owe drops a little bit every time we print off more money and cause inflation, except our debt to the federal reserve, which grows when that happens.
It's hilarious. We have these other countries like China hoping we will pay them back at some point in our own national currency. In fact, most of the world's national debts are in dollars. Meanwhile, we are growing further and further in debt with the central banking system.
Makes ya think that maybe the inflation -&gt; hyperinflation thing isn't an accident.

I've found that on most issues, people will rush to make a decision about something, and then spend most of their 'thought' trying to justify that original position. It is hard to get people to change stances one way or another.
FOMO is also a huge factor. When people don't want to take the risk to invest in or be a part of something that could backfire, the only stance they can take is "Pyramid scheme, will never work, pointless, MtGox lawl, blahblahblah."

Do we know that they won't allow you to exchange your Bitcoin for the dollar equivalent? 
It's gonna be hard to find tables full of Bitcoin users, but they really need a better withdrawal and deposit process, so maybe they intend to use Bitcoin for just that. That way, you wouldn't be gambling while you gamble. 
The article even says they are going to use a vendor to facilitate Bitcoin transactions which means to me that they will not be holding onto Bitcoins for users, but rather providing the equivalent balance in dollars.

Honestly, money laundering and tax evasion.
Let's say you've owned 10 BTC for a few years now and want to sell them for fiat. You have the option to pay a ~30% sales tax or a 5% markup at a BTM.
Also, if you wanted to launder a few grand, buy some drugs online, or do anything else that requires transmitting money with discretion, then there is good motivation to use the BTM.
Of course this is assuming the ATM doesn't require much identity verification. If they do require a lot of verification of identity, then who knows why the hell someone would use one.
EDIT: While I still believe these are the greatest incentives for using these machines, I could also see them being used for small amounts for convenience. If you want $20 of BTC, you probably won't mind paying the $1 extra or so.
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:41:24
Sigh... directly from your link:
"Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous. You know they’re willing to be known so the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering."
I'm sure he supports the technology behind Bitcoin. There is zero indication that he supports Bitcoin. He hasn't invested in it. He associates it with terrorism and money laundering. 
Oh and the big one: He is the wealthiest man in the world (in fiat) and also owns one of the biggest corporations in the world! You think he wants to support something that will devalue the very fiat that his wealth is tied to? He wants to create an alternative. He has said this at least two separate times now.

Bill Gates hasn't invested and hasn't said anything positive really. The most positive thing he said is that it demonstrates how easy sending money could be. He wants to develop an alternative to Bitcoin not associated with money laundering and terrorism. So tired of the Bill Gates circle jerk when the dude is clearly not going to support a decentralized cryptocurrency for so many reasons.

When you need to move coins from that wallet to another.
I generate and store my wallets and keys offline and then add them as watch only addressed on blockchain.info until I need to spend coins,  at which point I just use my webcam to scan the private key real quick.

If they were buying up Bitcoins, they would do everything they could to not let us know, so that they could keep acquiring them for cheaper.
Hell if we really wanna put our tin foil caps on, the banks or a team of software developers associated with the banks could be satoshi and already have 1,000,000+ coins.

I read it. I see zero proof of a Bitcoin channel to fund that shit. Find the funding address on the block chain. This whole article is just a guy making a ton of wild speculations and hinting at "trends".

The Fed has not stopped printing money.

Still too soon for major merchant adoption IMO.
Also, how would Uber do this since you pay after the fact. You pay up or they never give you a ride again? I know that Uber/Lyft drivers get to charge the customers card for all clean up costs if they throw up in their car or something. Those costs can be hundreds of dollars. How would they possibly collect that money from bitcoiners? Backup credit card on file I guess?

I like the quote, but this probably belongs in more than here. Don't see how this quote directly relates to Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:39:55
Here's how I see it:
If they were going to do this, they would do it right now, when other miners are turning off their rigs because the price is too low.
If the price goes up significantly in the next year or so, there will be more of an incentive to mine, and the cost of performing such an attack would increase because of that increase in hash rate and difficulty.

The point that just because it isn't used by them yet doesn't mean it won't be in the future is a good point. I still hardly see that as a reason why something is bad. Lots of great technological developments will also help terrorists and others with malicious intentions. Advancements in medicine, computers, personal travel, and weaponry will all end up helping terrorism too, that doesn't mean they are bad.

Agreed. It definitely makes me think less of him and I still see this as a cheap shot at Bitcoin just thrown in at the end with no evidence to support it. I actually liked the first part of his response. Unlike most people in this sub, I could care less if he doesn't support Bitcoin, and his two points about it not working well for are perfectly reasonable. (Well in regards to  I don't really understand how you just accidentally pay someone for something.... but I digress). his comment about terrorism just seemed so out of the blue.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:27:48
It's certainly true until it's not.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:09:31
And the main exchanges back then, gox and btc-e, didn't have an option to short.
There were more ways to buy it than sell/spend it back then. That's not the case anymore.

The interest he gets on his savings is higher than the annual inflation rate.
His net worth is more than 20x the entire Bitcoin market cap. He would be very hard presses to buy Bitcoin and make any considerable money off of it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:55:38
Why would he mention terrorists? Frustrating...
Why in the world would terrorists want to be funded in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:19:45
It really caught me off guard that he threw that in there. Clearly he sees Bitcoin as competition IMO. Why else would he make a completely unprovoked and unsubstantiated remark on Bitcoin being used by terrorists. Been saying it for a long time, Bill Gates is not behind Bitcoin itself, and I would go as far to say that he isn't even behind the key principles of Bitcoin. He has nothing to gain by supporting anything decentralized. 
EDIT: Why the downvotes? Someone want to give me any other explantion why he would throw a remark about terrorism in there?
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:59:30
~2% drop in price is a crash? Bitcoin varies 2% every 4 hours. We are better than this @_date: 2015-01-20 20:06:45
Arbitrage. For example, if they pump the price to $10,000 on their exchange(s) without demand supporting that price rise, then people will buy coins for cheaper through localbitcoins or another exchange, and then sell them on the exchanges with BTC at $10,000. So this would certainly only lose them money.

Out of curiosity, what kind of exchange fees do you pay for that? Do you pay spot price +1% or something?
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:46:58

It depends how you define the dollar, or more accurately, a federal reserve note. There are no digital dollars. There are digital ledgers of debt which account for most of the money in circulation, but there is no such thing as a digital dollar, per se.

Well it's an off-ramp too. Just to be fair.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:54:32
He is implying that Bitcoin itself is undervalued or this startup is overvalued. I think we can all assume that the investors in this startup are pretty big players that know how to value a startup.

No it's not... you wouldn't be hoarding/saving if you weren't speculating that the price will go up or at least remain the same.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:08:34
I can't follow this line of thought at all..
So they are paying 10BTC per transaction. Those Bitcoins go right to the miners. How many transactions can they possibly do at 10BTC per? Just because they have an absurd amount of resourced doesn't mean they are going to burn them all at 10BTC = $2,950 per transaction... And you are talking about doing so many transactions per second that miners are so occupied with these high fee transactions that they can't even get to the rest of the network's transactions. So that would be 7 transactions per second. So these bankers are gonna spend $2,950 x 7 = $20,000 per second in order to take over the network? Ok sure... I'll play a long a little further: Let's say they wanna do this for one hour. That's $74.3 million for an hour of taking over the network for one hour.
At 1 BTC mining fees, that's a cost of $7.4 Million to take over the network for an hour. $740,000 at .1 BTC. This is all if we are still stuck at 7 transactions per secound maximum.
And this is all motivated by them wanting to destroy Bitcoin? I don't know about you, but when I hear that bankers are spending millions an hour (in BTC that they bought up) just to try to take over the network and destroy Bitcoin, I think I'll be buying...
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:17:53
They have the most volume because they have no fees and, on top of that, many also believe that they manipulate the volume they report.'

Right I mean, if you can get set up with one of these other wallets and feel comfortable using it, then they are probably a better option. I haven't really bothered, mostly because I doubt any of those wallets are available on iOS and I send from multiple machines.
Blockchain.info is just a really easy way to do some quick BTC management from any machine I might be on.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:09:28
It will basically be exactly like Venmo is now, but with Facebook. I see this as a threat to Venmo.
There are still many things Bitcoin is not ready for. One of those is common peep to peer transactions. For example I find myself relying on Venmo to collect entry dues for our march madness bracket because there is no way I'm convincing a lot of people to buy $20 of Bitcoin at fluctuating prices and have me hold that as a prize pool. There is no way a friend of mine would accept $20 in Bitcoin for me to reimburse him for a meal he just bought me or something.
I hate Venmo and love Bitcoin but that doesn't mean I don't see why people aren't all in Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:11:21
Well I would argue that Bitcoin would have not made it this far without it, for one. It's nice to be able to keep track of Bitcoin days destroyed, if/when satoshi comes back online, etc...

Sending coins to an exchange and back will cost you at most .0002 Bicoins.
People selling Bitcoins for cash on LBC usually charge at least 4% markup....
It's really quite lucrative if you can find a way to get your coins without it being discovered that you are selling them on LBC.
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:09:08
For one transaction, you probably aren't too concerned. For high frequency transactions, you would start to care.

@_date: 2015-03-11 14:31:29
So if I'm understanding the back and forth argument about Blythe today, the fear is that she will control a small amount of Bitcoin, basically white list them, and then just use those colored coins to do transactions between banks/exchanges on wall street?
While this doesn't seem like super positive new for Bitcoin, I still don't see how this is terrible for it.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:21:46

@_date: 2015-03-12 20:01:21
Well before the November 2013 bubble, the previous ATH was $275. Back before last December, people were claiming that that would be the big support that would never be broken. So when we dipped below $300 at the end of last December and continued to plow right through $275, we hit $166 within two weeks.
So $300 is just a huge psychological level. There is good reason why we are tensely hovering around that point right now and people are thinking that whichever way we go next will determine if we are still in a bear market or not.
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:34:18
It's pretty easy to switch to sending in Bitcoin on Circle, but they could certainly make it easier.

@_date: 2015-03-11 17:32:26
Of every single scenario you just listed, the only one that would impact Bitcoin negatively would be her coming out as Satoshi.
Even if she goes to a miner and pays cash to have all of her transactions included for free... she is still effectively paying a miner fee. That miner must be getting enough cash from her to prioritize over the standard transactions with .0001 BTC mining fees. I see no problem with this.
You completely lost me with this part: 


So then you are saying she won't be successful with this venture or that she will use something other than Bitcoin?


Simple solution here. Her service is the one sending the colored coins... so she just doesn't double spend them and the banks trust her on this.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:32:28

If a bank suspected you of running a MSB, they would simply file a suspicious activity report and not even bother telling you.
By the way, I assume you were buying your coins via Circle and Coinbase and then selling them on LBC? Any attempt to mix your coins before selling them?
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:41:32

The difference is working off of one public ledger versus multiple private ledgers. 
There is no public ledger for the U.S. Dollar. Hell, Rand Paul has been trying to audit the federal reserve for over a year now.

Coinbase is a great way to get coins if you just want to buy and hold and don't mind being a little more transparent on your side.
Localbitcoins is a good way to buy some and never have to hand over your identity though. You'll generally pay a premium for that bonus. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:44:32

Not only that, but lyft/uber drivers have the security of being able to charge any damages (vomit, spilled drinks, etc.) to the user's credit card. theoretically you could pay with bitcoin and have a credit card as backup, but kinda defeats the purpose.
I've become extremely pessimistic about bitcoin lately and I've been bullish for so long. 2014 was rough and 2015 really isn't sahping up much better.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:31:00
And preferably fiat at the tables. This means they will likely need a third party service for turning Bitcoins into fiat.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:36:32
I guess my problem with that line of thought is that some alt-coins have that same backing. I think any 'backing' should be exclusive.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:59:58
They were going to or already have implemented address monitoring practices already, I am sure. This just makes it more public, which is fine with me.

So let's say she is able to pay something like .1 BTC per transaction as a miner's fee, and does so many transactions that she effectively stops the network from performing other transactions.
Where is that .1BTC to use as a miner's fee coming from? Surely not from their set of colored coins that she is using to represent debt. Otherwise, that .1BTC would be a huge fee. So is she then just going to snag .1BTC off of the market or from some other stash of Bitcoin in order to pay the miner's fee? If she is doing enough transactions to clog the network, how many BTC would she be purchasing just for this purpose?
After typing that all out, it sure seems like the system is pretty immune to this kind of attack but maybe you can tell me why I'm wrong.

"All that is needed to send and receive Bitcoin is a public address and corresponding private key. You only need to know the public address to be able to send coins to that address, but you must know the private key as well to send coins from that address."
After that, guage their level of technical aptitude and then direct them to either coinbase/circle/blockchain.info. With Circle, it's really just as simple as paypal. You can send them to people's email addresses.

Honestly I'd consider Gyft kind of cheating too... When you pay for something with Gyft, the total shows up in dollars, not Bitcoin.
I think it's far too early for this experiment to have very positive results. At least here in the US.

Exactly. Great analogy.

It's damn near free. And if they continue to not pay miner's fees, then it will be free. The security is math baby!

Alright I suppose I was.

Indeed. Keep in mind they only offer spot trading currently too. Just wait until they offer futures/margin/shorting/etc

This sounds interesting but I don't think even the most hardcore Bitcoin fanatics would claim this could be easily done right now. How you gonna pay your rent/electricity/water with Bitcoin? It's a cool experiment, but I think the end result is gonna be "Hey look, there isn't much Bitcoin infrastructure yet."

I learned early on that there is no benefit to be gained from trying to explain my interest in Bitcoin to most people I talk with.

You know, I get downvoted every time I say this, but Bill Gates is not going to throw support behind something that he didn't create and does not serve to benefit him, his company, or his charities. Think whatever you will of the man, but above all else, he in a businessman. 
The most positive thing that can be taken away from his comments about Bitcoin is that he is scared by it. The man randomly throws lines about terrorism into remarks about Bitcoin even though there has been absolutely no proof of Bitcoin financing terrorism to any serious degree. 
P.S. Spare me that one bullshit article that 5 people always link to when they try to tell me that Bitcoin finances terrorism.

Need to break out of the bear trend down from ~$1100, and then people will feel more confident holding and lest confidence shorting.

Not sure why you had to be downvoted to oblivion for asking a reasonable question.
However, there are millions of coins out there that could be dumped at any moment without any notice or reason, so there is not much use in worry about whatever supply of coins they have being dumped. Every day that passes without true whales dumping their coins is another majority vote that the price is not high enough to warrant selling their coins at this price.

This should be common practice anyways obviously.

I disagree. Seems to me like all of these events fall perfectly into someone's scheme to drive up bitcoin value, and then when it's plummeting, put a lock down on one of the biggest banks fiat currency trading while you assure that you can sell all of your bitcoins first.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:18:04
Interesting.

If I have some bitcoins on Coinbase, how can I get them onto a personal wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:48:38
I was planning on it, I'm just curious what people think will happen.

Haha I will definitely invest a minimum of a few hundred if it hits $10. I could accept losing that all for a chance at 120x gain. How much I would buy would depend on the cirumstances of the crash. Another currency(or whatever you wanna call it) coming to rise would make me want to buy less for sure.
