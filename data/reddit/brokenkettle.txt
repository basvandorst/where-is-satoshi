I bought from LocalBitcoins, saved the 10 day wait and the amount I paid above the market rate was made back in less than 10 days. Good way to get started but leaves you a touch more vulnerable to a drop in the market.

Sure, I'll help mod the sub reddit for you and anything else I can do, I know personally some good local to me artists (South West UK) who I could collect coins for (guarantee they have no idea what a bitcoin is yet) and could surprise them with the whatever bitcoin tips they earned. They'd be busking without even realising it!

Plot Twist: This leak is all part of an elaborate plan by whomever created bitcoin by bringing the hidden billions/trillions out of the hands of the worlds richest tax evaders into bitcoin as they seek to avoid confiscation and taxation this in turn will turbo charge bitcoin's growth into the mainstream.

I agree, I only bought a couple at £53 each. Bought some ripple XRP and have been working out what to do with the rest, offered some to friends but mostly got funny looks. I still am happy to spend them and buy more at a higher price as I believe over time an ongoing price rise is likely and if not I don't mind risking a few hundred quid as I like the idea.

LocalBitcoins is how I got my first (UK) it was just so much easier than the waiting around. I paid over the market rate and there's a real risk of scammers so look at sellers feedback but all in all I was happy with how it went and now my couple of bitcoins are worth at least £10 each more than I paid for them in under a week. I figure if the market ever crashes I'll just buy more, I have faith in bitcoin but at the same time I'd never risk more than I can afford to lose.

You can buy coins off of ebay with paypal but it's a bit above market value to account for all the fees.

I don't know what I'm doing...

Still early stages yet, expect an economy to grow very quickly as more &amp; more have way more in bitcoins than they do in fiat. This value rise is in line with what buyers consider it's worth, the market will decide and the risk will always encourage spending and selling for fiat.

Yeh good call, I'll keep my eye on it's development. 
I think you're probably right, a rule where only the verified artist can post their music would be better from a tippers perspective, otherwise why risk it going to someone else.

Cheers, handy guide. I like the way everyone who does use them is very helpful I guess the more people use it the more likely value will increase so it's in the interests of current users to spread the word.

Its quite obvious what happened, some people had so much money/bitcoins they wanted to buy more drugs than is possible to receive in the post without suspicion and had to cash out to get their drugs and treat themselves to some hookers (fun fact: only 4% of hookers take bitcoin and they're at least 9% more expensive than less tech savvy hookers).
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:19:52
Great idea. I agree pushing this system will benefit BitCoin immensely, I think in the future we will look back and amazed at how BitCoin just kept growing in value as it became the currency of choice on the internet.

So close to £200...
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:07:02
I used localbitcoins.com with bank transfer, bought some at £50 each and it took no time at all. Paid about 10% more than market price at the time but made that back by the end of the same day because of price rises.

Sorry, I was meant to be all cool just turning up chucking tips about but turns out I can't even look cool on the internet. That's the first time I've used the tipbot, once I've worked it out a bit better maybe you'll get your tip after all.

You sir are what's known as a "fucking legend", that kind of generosity to a complete stranger gives me faith in the internet.

Start tipping waiting staff with denominations of bitcoins, show them how it works, it will increase interest particularly among the low paid workers of the world.

Many are in it for the money, many are in it because of hope, some are both. I'd be lying if I didn't say the money was enchanting but as well as look after myself I'd love to be in a position financially to do something good for the world. The internet attracts many of the shy, the dreamers, the awkward, the geeks, these are the early adopters.

This right here, this is what we need! I am going to start a wordpress blog soon for my travels round Europe, I'd like to promote and use bitcoin as I travel a donation button on the site is a perfect first step and will hopefully mean I can be ad free.

I couldn't agree more my good sir, it also solves the problem of people being dicks on message boards because why be a dick if there's a chance someone will tip you for being nice or helpful. I only have a couple so far but even that £100 punt I believe will eventually offer a huge return.

Maybe just some slang terms then, for fun to help widen the appeal, I saw someone call a bitcent an internet on reddit the other day.
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:29:19
Bitcoins first aim should be to become the internet's local currency, it wont become anything unless it can at least manage that first.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:34:13
I had this same idea the other day but I'm too lazy so I did nothing about it, if the sub reddit gets popular perhaps you could build a website where new acts can submit videos, small cut for site owner majority to the act, great way for new artists to finance studio time without having to rely on a label to take them on.

It's just because buying in the UK is a pain to do, I bought from localbitcoins at over the odds but it was worth it because in the week that followed the price I paid was the same as MtGov. But we desperately need our own bitcoin source/exchange in the UK, I get the impression our banks have been less than helpful to anyone wishing to setup exchanges as we've seen with other exchanges dropping UK services.

I was going to treble my investment at $100 per bitcoin but decided not to in an attempt to be sensible, wish I had! But the risk is always there and I'm glad I haven't lost sight of that despite the rising value, but everyday I nearly buy more.
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:32:47
I was thinking this very thing just earlier today. When the porn industry adopts bitcoin expect a massive rise in bitcoin value. I genuinely believe my small amount of bitcoins will make me very wealthy eventually, I see no reason why 1BTC will not one day be enough to buy a nice home. Biggest weakness is the chance established institutions will attack it, if that happens and they destroy it, oh well I only lost a small sum.
