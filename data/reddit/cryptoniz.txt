I just wrote this (by the way) in another related topic:
Interesting. I typed in those addresses that were highlited manually. These are the reported amounts according to blockchain. Note that all addresses were active until 6 feb 2014, so it is highly likely that they are in the ownership of Mt. Gox since it correlates with the withdrawal hold of earlier this month.

The insolvency line is still there.

Although I do not agree with your chosen words and way of phrasing, I agree with your underlying message. If those people do not equal to "their" way of thinking, they are a perceived threat and therefore equal to "less smart".
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:10:09
Yeah people get emotional with these kind of things.
ELI5 (for me and other readers): What is/was the current role of Mantrid with mtgox?

somebody should set up an exchange where you can acquire rights for potential future yubi keys, and you can only trade them against the ones that are currently out there...

We all know the feeling!
Its a high-volatile investment, and one that could turn a nice profit in the longer term (if you can withstand the short term crazyness)

I believe this is a classic pump and dump. 
Edit: downvote? Since fundamentals are lacking, do you care to explain why you don't think this is a pump and dump?

I just checked the new posts in r/bitcoin... so many similar postings! I hope the timestamp makes this announcement as traceable in the future..? 
Edit: And they did add their logo now to the announcement!

TIL: You weren't able to cancel your withdrawal at mt. gox before...

From "soon" to "silence" and back to "soon".
The question is, which one of them is less worse? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:08:33
Interesting. The frequency of those transactions look like "regular" network transactions, but they all stop at 6/02/2014. My question then is, why are all last recorded dust transaction at the 6th? And why not later?

Actually, having their name as a management consultancy firm linked to a leaking of documents will hurt their business and reputation in the future. 
IMO: If I was a client of them I'd call them in and have a serious talk about them about how my information is secured with them and how it is better for me to drop my business with them..

Who is a consultant at [Mandalah](
According to said website this is his background:
* Consultant
* Samir Bennafla has a degree in Business Strategy from a French Business School and followed that with the MBA program at Nagoya University in Japan. His passions of video games, technology and innovation drove Samir to create a link with engineering, and he joined the Engineering School “École Centrale Paris” to perfect his technical knowledge in IT, energy and new technologies. Samir has 3 years of experiences in Project management and Marketing Strategy, developed for a year a breakthrough IT-Healthcare innovation for Orange (France Telecom) called “The Connected Hospital”. He came back to Japan as a Market analyst for the Bouygues Group and finally joined Mandalah as an innovation consultant.
* “Becoming complex to better understand simplicity. In the Japanese culture a lot of things seem to be simple at first; kind citizens following rules, simple wood, quiet shrines and even food – What is sushi ? Raw fish on a rice ball…. But we know that the reality behind this simplicity is more complex and a lot of work needed to be achieved to get that simplicity. I believe that it’s the same for technology and innovation, to adapt a product or a service to a complex final user. I try to challenge myself and my technical knowledge everyday, fight against my own way of thinking and try to learn from the others.”

The guy is on a coca cola and recently put on 30kg. According to said conversation. If it's all true, I cannot imagine the kind of stress the guy is currently under.

Increasing your overdraft in order to gamble in BTC.. so crazy! 
You were lucky, but damn..

What is the source of this information and can anyone confirm this? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:24:55
It is related to that what we would call 'disaster tourism', and the usual way of people thinking this way is that they are glad they are not the ones suffering (but they are intrigued by those who are).
Sadly, but true, its inherent to our human nature.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:39:54
It is really a pity that you'd have to go and complain on reddit and use the name of the service combined with the word scam in order to get your hard earned BTC back. Luckily enough I see an attempt from them to recover your BTC. But sounds like a PR move to me.
I wonder what other customers that are "forgotten" and will maybe get by going through traditional means...
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:39:59


Well, you've come to the right sub for saying this. r/bitcoin will love this one!
Also this is not really right sub for this.  would love to have you...!

Best analogy so far!

If these addresses have the same owner with the one OP reported here
then I'd have to add those 50K to the total holdings balance.






@_date: 2014-02-25 15:29:40
Haha... there is some irony in this...

I guess being polite results in more richer answers in terms of information value than yelling at him.

The million dollar question.
To the moon.. or to the soon?!
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:37:19
Most interesting fact is that OP revealed his most important source of information:
The Mandalah consultancy firm.
Who is in fact not knowledgable of actual financial information (hard data, facts, etc) as cited here:


So currently I am skeptical of all information that is published.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:04:37
The address reported in another posting shows similar activity, with the OP there [claiming]( it is also related to the 2011 transactions.
If so, I'd have to add those 50K to the total holdings balance.

That is a surprisingly positive attitude towards bitcoin/crypto, one I'd have not expected from the CEO of an organization as large and known as WU.

I do not see any facts collaborating the insolvency statement and "$400 million" (see comments) that mtgox supposedly needs for a bailout (or similar).
I'd love to see that Blockchain elaborates on this
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:21:19
Aren't you just trying to capitalise on the bad news (new reddit account and all)?
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:45:47
Funny thing is, the SWOT analysis is not properly formatted. This looks like a rush job, and a very bad one. I guess this paper is, at best, just an incomplete draft. 
No way that any proper management consultancy would publish such a thing to it's client.
Edit: And the part about licking the heels of the CEO looks like somebody who wants to go "up" desperately... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:06:59
I don't think this will work. How would you make proof of this mandatory requirement (official sepa rules [here]( source eu payment council):


If you are the person who made the SEPA transfer? I mean, it was your gamble to begin with? If you are the owner of your account, and you've made a legit transfer to mt. gox poland, how are you going to get the payment back?
(It is not triggered with fraudulent intent in this case, since you were willingly to transfer the money to gox).

Hmm. Interesting to read such a thing in r/bitcoin. What if the ficticious sender of such a response was mt. gox? 
Food for thought here...

More proof in an old video of him (2010, 242 views);
It's the same cat he has posted on his youtube channel.
