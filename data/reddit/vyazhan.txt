No worries, I agree with what you said :) Should be strong for a while, even if it dips for a short time after the fork!

What does that have to do with me buying back Litecoins after the hard-fork tho?

BTC/LTC has been a trustworthy pair for me in the past!

Same here, will buy back after hard-fork :D

You can try out Kraken, lightning fast deposits from Europe and they now accept most US states as well :)

Woocommerce works very well for this purpose and allows integration with a large variety of payment processors. This way, you can accept many dozens of different coins and are not limited to just a few, if you so please :)
It's also a lot more convenient and, as stated, open source!

Tether is no digital fiat though, but yet another IOU of the IOU

You mean like the Red Cross or Unicef? 
Google around and see where your money goes when you give it to the guys that have CEOs collecting over a million per year and driving around in Rolls Royces! 
Rather give it to people that truly care and have the money arrive in full and not only 15% of it!
Edit: Oxfam seems to be the least greedy of the 3 mentioned big players from what I could quickly gather, I should have a deeper research tomorrow! :)
