Hi, just posted in another thread about this but maybe here will be faster. I recently got bitcoin-qt and started with getting free coins from sites, so id put the wallet address into them all, saying i got the free 0.00001 whatever. But it took 5 -6 days for my first transaction to come through, what am i doing wrong?

Awesome, thanks for the information, and not being too blunt.

Oh, so if i were to say deposit some bitcoins that i purchased (Which i have not) would it take significantly less time to transact? Also, is it possible to transfer coins from mtgox to your own wallet? Thank you very much for your help.

Is this part of the price is going down right now?

Newbie here, Have the same problem, friends aren't remotely interested in learning about it and go straight to saying things like "You cant just make something out of nothing." I have yet to put anything down on Bitcoins yet, have been reading and observing it for the past week, Still not ready though i think.

Hi, newbie here, just started using Bitcoin-qt wallet. Im only generating free coins right now off websites, but i am just curious as to why it takes so long to go to my wallet? Im using websites that give within 24hrs and it took about 5 days to get one transaction in.. Am i doing something wrong?
