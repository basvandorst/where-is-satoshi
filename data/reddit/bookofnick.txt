I would love to get my hands on one of these flyers. OP, is this yours? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:11:41
Your explanation about having a system in place to load them makes sense, but I have some doubts that these will ever change hands without the buyer first verifying the amount on the blockchain. Additionally, I think you would get a lot more customers buying your certificates if they only had to trust you as far as the certificates, instead of also having to trust you with the bitcoin being loaded onto the certificate. 
Your product looks great, though, and I actually did place an order with you guys today. Looking forward to checking them out!
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:21:06
Right - the generic ones you can buy unloaded, but if you buy a denominated note (i.e. 1 BTC note) you have to send them the price of the certs, plus the actual 1 BTC, before they will ship you the note. Once you get the note, you let them know and they load it from their end. But you're still "out" 1 BTC until they send it.
@_date: 2015-12-05 00:25:17
They said the "B" word like 20 times...just not the "B" word you want them to say. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:57:29
I've looked into these, but am wondering why on earth they would require these certificates to be pre-loaded. This requires me to send them bitcoin up-front. I wanted to buy a 1 BTC certificate, but hesitant to send 1 BTC + price of certificate to someone in Switzerland. Not to mention the security risk of a loaded BTC wallet being sent overseas to me in the US. (EDIT: you must pay them BTC at time of purchase, but it's not loaded until you confirm receipt).
I understand that they don't want to misrepresent the amount loaded in the certificate for future buyers of the item, but this is a collectible, not something people will be paying each other with without double-checking the value on the blockchain. Any potential buyer can scan the QR code on the back so that they can easily verify the funds are in the address.

I would recommend, as seemingly every other bitcoiner here does, any phone which has "vanilla" Android or close to it - Android as Google intended, without the skin or extra apps that manufacturers like Samsung and HTC pre-install.
A nexus device will indeed be this experience, which I agree is great. I jumped from a Galaxy Nexus straight to a Moto X, which I love, but almost went for the Nexus 5 until Moto X had their Cyber Monday deal, which brought the price of the Moto X on par with the Nexus 5. 
That being said, every phone I've ever owned has been magnitudes better than the previous. I was iPhone from 2007-2012, then switched to android. And these days, I would say that Android is great on all phones. And I would say that Bitcoin apps work equally well (anyone feel free to correct me) on most modern Android phones. Read some reviews and welcome to Android!

I know people have different reasons for supporting Bitcoin, but my reason is that I think Bitcoin can make governments and the politicians that run them obsolete. I think that government is a cancer that infects us all by default. Giving any kind of support to any politician, no matter how nice he/she may be, is support for a system that is not just broken, but evil. 
So forgive me if I think that donating Bitcoin to government representatives is a bit like throwing gasoline on a raging fire that has been consuming our economy and our life for way too long. 
TL;DR I probably won't donate Bitcoin to Jared Polis.

Okay, so I've been journaling pretty regularly for over 15 years now and have a stack of words and drawings that is over 25 books high. I've been through the gamut of book types and for the last few years I've been loyal to Moleskine and Moleskine copycats because I'm super picky about my books and it's the style I've most preferred. 
I bought a Baron and Fig with bitcoin a couple months back not expecting to love it. But I'm now about 1/3 through mine and I must say it's growing on me. I'll probably order a couple more. I've just had one minor issue with a page corner starting to lift out between the edge of the book and the first stitch. If it's not closed gently, it will catch and fold the inner edge of the page. Can be solved easily by moving that top and bottom spine stitch closer to the book edge (maybe in a future version). I'd also like to see more size options, but I do like the size as is. 
As a side note, if there is one single bit of life advice I would give to young people, it's this: write a journal. I get that it's tough in this digital age. But set down the smartphone and close the laptop for a few minutes each day and put pen to paper to write or just doodle. You will be amazed at the richness of your thoughts and insights as you look back years later. Plus, the value of something as personal and private as a handwritten journal becomes increasingly important in this age of internet permanence and surveillance. I've been journaling since I was 15, and I've been able to look back and glimpse my youth in ways that have made me laugh and cry. I also write a journal for my son to document the early years that he won't remember. 
TL;DR: Baron Fig deserves some love for making a good product, accepting bitcoin, and hodling. And for God's sake keep a journal!

Just because the Federal Reserve has stated twice now (once through Bernanke and now through Yellen) that they don't have the authority to regulate Bitcoin doesn't mean they don't want it regulated or it won't be regulated. It's more likely that they simply mean that the regulation of Bitcoin in the U.S. should go through the proper channels of government. 
The Federal Reserve has a lot of power and influence, for sure, but they can't make laws directly. So, really, this statement doesn't mean much of anything. If Bitcoin in the U.S. is regulated to any degree, it won't be because of the FED. It will be your senators, congressmen, etc. who have the interests of the FED at heart...or at least in their wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:37:16
When you say you want to ban Bitcoin, what you are saying is that you want to use the force of law to prevent and punish people for transmitting bits of digital information between each other.

I'm not sure I understand, or maybe I'm not doing it correctly. I sent 0.005 BTC from one of my addresses and then sent 0.001 back to the same address. I sent it with "coinjoin mixing enabled," but all that seemed to do was route the transaction through a single intermediary address that had a couple other transactions attached to it. So all I have to do to see where the coins came from is trace it one step back in the blockchain. That doesn't seem to give a whole lot of anonymity...or what'm I missin?

People respond to economic incentives. I'm a huge advocate of BTC, and just this evening passed over TigerDirect. Bought a chromebook. Was looking at it on TigerDirect. Amazon had it for the same price. The difference is, if I buy on Amazon I first buy an Amazon gift card from Gyft, who gives me 3% cash back for using BTC. I bought on Amazon. 
I do think that when places like Overstock and TigerDirect get more data on what they're saving by using BTC, they will be more likely to offer incentives for BTC payments like Gyft does. When they do, I'll be their customer.

One option I would consider very secure is simply memorizing your seed. As a hedge against the slight chance of your death or brain damage or something else which may cause you to forget your seed, you could possibly have another trusted party (i.e. spouse, parent, sibling) memorize the seed as well. Then you'd have the Trezor, plus two backups. 
Edit: plus the backup you'd have in the safe deposit box

Cool idea, but I can't see myself using it. My cellular reception works great for me in any city, and I can just tether any device to it at no extra cost. And my cell service seems to get faster and cheaper every year. 
Is the point to replace my cell carrier by roaming onto different WiFi networks? If so, I might be interested, but I'd need to have some kind of assurance that I would always have access to internet wherever I am. My cell phone gives me that assurance, more or less.

Mycelium awesomely allows you to keep addresses as "watch only" as denominated in his screenshot with a lack of a key logo next to that address. It allows you to view it as just another one of your addresses, but without spend capability.

Ledger is also supported with Mycelium, Electrum, Copay and Green Address wallets. Not to mention the interface on their own website (my.ledgerwallet.com).

Agreed. I'm all about giving respect where it's deserved, but I also think that giving undeserved respect enables the abusers in our society, be it parents, teachers, politicians, or regulators. 
Compromise is fine, as long as there are no guns involved. With any law, however, must come the guns. Then it's not a discussion. It's a hostage crisis.

Wouldn't hurt to diversify a little bit, but I think most will agree bitcoin is the safer bet. If any alts are be truly useful, that's way out on the horizon. But in times of high volatility, they can be very fun to trade! I'm personally in Bitcoin, Litecoin and Namecoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:23:07
Probably not a great idea. That would be like ripping out the half the pages of a ledger book. All those records are gone. When it comes to "Who owes what?" no one would know if that page is missing. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:40:22
Sure it is. You're getting the benefit of being able to spend bitcoin without the need for a linked bank account. The merchants get the benefit of secure and irreversible transactions. Its halfway to total bitcoin adoption. Isn't that better than using a bank card?

I drove about an hour out of my way on a road trip in 2013 to visit your Subway in Allentown because you accepted BTC. Was so excited to use BTC because so few places around the country accepted it!
The people there could not figure out how to allow me to pay in BTC, so I paid in dollars and my wife laughed at me. 
That was my experience. Thanks for helping me hodl, at least!

Businesses can accept and hold BTC without exchange rate risk using a service such as (Mycelium integrated) Coinapult, which anchors your BTC to a USD value. While this doesn't solve all the problems involved with this, it solves a big one.

Normally a fee with less than 0.0001 BTC would be okay, but not in today's environment. I would think you would need at least 0.003 to get a timely confirmation. There were way more transactions than normal today.

Well, here's the screenshot of my send page using Shifty:  - I did send the GEMZ, but as I said, it expired, so it never did shift and send bitcoin to that address. 
I'll email support about it later.

Ha-ha, so nice!
@_date: 2016-10-25 04:21:02
You could try it, but then only people on your forked version could transact with you. You'd need to convince a lot of people to use your version in order for it to have value as a network. And yes, it's been tried, most notably with XT, Classic, and now being tried with Unlimited. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:34:22
This took me a while to figure out, and I still didn't do it correctly. I have my purse.io account linked to Coinbase, so when I checked out there wasn't any option to use the Shifty button. I even cancelled the order, went into my purse.io settings and disabled "snap checkout" and tried the order again, but it still went through automatically without giving me the option to pay with Shapeshift, I think because it had already debited my Coinbase account and the bitcoins were already in escrow. 
Anyway,  I was able to use the Shifty button to load my purse.io account with the needed amount of bitcoin by sending 832.6787979 GEMZ (0.03010126 BTC) with this deposit address 1GHp5SsNDYsP1jyxbzYtSMGXxtx3amAwxS but 10 minutes after sending it, the transaction expired and it never detected that the GEMZ were sent to that address. I guess it'll broadcast/confirm eventually...
