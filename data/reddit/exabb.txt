I recommend you help him get a [MOBI]( wallet with complementary Visa Debit card in USD.
He can store his LTC, BTC etc. in the wallet  and use the card for online buying, ATM withdrawal or just to pay in stores. The 2,5 % USD -&gt;DKK exchange fee is "covered" by the fact that his BTC already increased 200%

Coinomi has a list of forks and you can use the Coinomi wallet to claim them:

Sorry you are way off there. It cannot be hacked or brute forced:

Yes! if you have the 12 word seed you are ok. They can be used to "restore" on some other wallet eg. Coinomi (Android app) and then you have acces to all your funds.

Newbie? Then you´ll probably loose your coins trading. Your best option is to hold your coins for a few years.

Sorry but you seem to be very unsure about how this cryptothingy will unfold, and there is nobody in here that can guarantee you one or the other chain is even going to survive. So a sound advice for you seems to be that you get out of cryptos into fiat, and then get sound investment advice from somebody in that world.

Rule  Only invest in cryptos what you can tolerate to lose. You may make a fortune, or you could worst case lose it all.

Take a look at Mobi.me

If you have money that you can accept to lose in a worst case scenario go for it and buy Bitcoin. But NEVER EVER buy cryptos with money you have loaned. So forget the Portugal thing and enjoy your Christmas instead

Hi, it looks nice, but you might as well start right away to support the European currencies, we simply don´t "think" in USD. If you want to reach the 500 million Europeans it must at least work with EUR and preferably also GBP and the Scandinavian flavors of Kroner: DKK, NOK, and SEK. Good luck with your project

Sounds great, I´m looking forward to testing your tracker

I we experience a *"global" EMP? something that wipes our computers of all data.* then Bitcoins would probably be the least of your problems.

B2X is not supporting Replay Protection, so you got that wrong in the graphic

To me it sounds like you would be better off leaving crypto currency alone, and get your money back into fiat and plain old bank accounts.

Thank you for the answer. As I read it Asicboost is disabled in SegWit2X  - IF - it is disabled in SegWit. So now I would really like a link to where it is stated officially that SegWit disables Asicboost. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:53:52
I also read it like SegWit2X does NOT guarantee blocking of Asicboost. 
Can anyone provide a link to a clarification, Is it blocked or not?
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:56:52
Could you please provide some links or point me in the direction of "learning day trade" and also Twitter links to these successful traders.  Thanks

If you live in the EU it is easy to open an account and then fund it with a SEPA transfer, it should only take 24 hours. You should probably be quite safe keeping fiat on the exchange, but it is recommended to transfer any cryptocoins to your own wallet.
