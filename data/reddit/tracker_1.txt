Makes sense to park a small amount of btc in an account like this if retailers see it as being in their best interests to accept payment with btc this way, it will increase the network effect and adoption, and customers may feel more confident about security than carrying the same amount of btc around in phone hot wallets

Mild 2yr recession (like back around 2001) until 2020-2021 then massive macro bull run until next 4yr GFC which will hit around 2026 and last till around 2030
Current 18 yr cycle started 2011
This cycle has repeated for many decades, it is driven by property prices, and until politicians who profit massively from appreciating real estate don’t want to profit anymore it will continue
Check out the work of Philip J Anderson, the most accurate macro forecaster I can find

The pentagon did a study on this subject and found that 3 days without food until almost everyone steals to get it, 8 days without food until almost everyone will kill other humans to steal it, 13-15 days without food until humans kill other humans to eat them...these time frames have been the same for all humans in all cultures and religions throughout the whole of history, if people around you haven’t eaten for 3 days get away from them as fast as possible unless you intend to kill them to survive, the animal brain will takeover, by 13-15 days without food people can’t stop fantasizing about killing to eat, it’s all they can think about,mothers have killed their own starving babies in these circumstances
