This seems to be the case for a lot of non-computer based hardware companies. Typically these brick and mortar and grease businesses lag behind the tech curve and it's a real shame. They seem to always get the biggest boost from the amount of automation and longer-reach of these innovations.

How do you pay rent and buy groceries? My income is also BTC but I have to convert for that. Are you using Xapo or something similar as a debit card?

Central banks do not. The Bank of England, as linked by knight222, is a central bank. I don't remember the last time anyone in was talking about "banks" in context of monetary policy besides central banks.
As you have said, "A central bank (the Fed in the case with US) can create as much money as it wants to. And then it can be lent out many times."

I don't understand why bitcoin believers and enthusiasts aren't rushing to be paid in bitcoin for their work. If you need USD for something, sell some BTC. Rather than existing primarily in a Fiat marketplace and experimenting in the BTC marketplace, make the jump! It's the only true adoption.

A lot of people would probably appreciate it if you first asked Google. When you're asking questions with fundamentally incorrect axioms, it can be frustrating for people who have already put time and effort into learning these things themselves. Reddit isn't a p2p encyclopedia, it is a discussion forum.

I asked them when I opened my account, about bitcoin businesses. As long as it's coinbase or another certified msb, it's OK with them.

So how did they get into your account, even with a correct password, without 2FA?

I think you misunderstood. Look at the gap between the sell price and buy price. Compare the gap and the rates to other exchanges. 
I don't think there are any legit exchanges that do what you are saying, "floating" the rate until the transfer of coins.

You had a whole thread about this already and it got downvoted into the ground where it belongs. You're using a pre-heartbleed iPhone app that hasn't been updated in over a year. I wouldn't be surprised to find out you use the same 3 passwords for everything and they use dictionary words.

No, it isn't. It's very simple math. It is less moral to kill 100 people than 10 by an order of magnitude.

Private property is absolutely a right.
Fiat currency is an exception, because the promissory note is the property of the central issuing bank.

The current issuance of money through debt increases wealth inequality consistently. Free trade generally always means those with the means to exchange higher volume will gain value faster than those exchanging lower volumes. Inequality growth in a free market will exist, and there are multiple problems and benefits to each system. We can say with certainty that bitcoin mitigates the debt based fiat issuance factor affecting inequality growth.

Boooo! I guess they could implement micro-transaction fees.

Aren't these methods de-valuing the ad-bubble that bitcoin is heavily valued in?
