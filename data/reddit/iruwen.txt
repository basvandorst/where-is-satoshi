The exchanges we have now won't be necessary as crypto has taken over, they're primarily needed for fiat to crypto exchange and will be replaced by fully decentralized exchanges in the future. Anyway exchanges don't control crypto, users do. Exchanges can manipulate the price, but not the circulating supply. And price manipulations on single exchanges will become less and less relevant with increasing liquidity on many exchanges. That's why I guess the world book (LIQUID/QASH) is an important project.

You have to be careful when you're setting up API keys for exchanges so you don't accidentally grant write permissions (although that usually also only means placing orders and stuff, withdrawals are again a separate permission). Other than that, you're safe.

But considering the old story about the shoeshine boy giving stock tips, it must generally have been pretty easy. But maybe those are just claims by people who don't have smartphones lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:44:36
Total amount of actual physical money (M0) is around 5-7 trillion depending on who you ask, which equals the total value of gold. If Bitcoin reaches 250-325k (depending on how you define circulating supply), we'd be there. That's possible, yeah. It only depends on how much people believe in it.

In the history of big bubbles, there have always been good reasons for the final burst. I just don't see that reason for Bitcoin. Considering how rare it is, it's still massively undervalued. Maybe it only appears to be such a massive bubble because it started from zero.

? you could short Bitcoin before, on many exchanges, with up to x100 leverage.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:08:19
Yeah okay, maybe noobs is too harsh. Just had a discussion with some colleagues trading stocks for decades who are new to crypto and they seemed a bit bewildered as well.  
I'm definitely not one of the religious guys though, e.g.  
  
I believe in technology and profit. Not sure if Bitcoin will survive all the attacks, that's why I'm more in alts. You never go all out of Bitcoin though.  
Even if Bitcoin fails, crypto will thrive and some alts will prevail in the long run. Ethereum for example was at $400 already when Bitcoin was at 10% of its max valuation. Bitcoin takes everything down with it as it moves, but the influx of money won't stop. We need more fiat pairs on big exchanges to emancipate from Bitcoin, Coinbase adding more alts will play a major role in this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:23
How could anyone not upvote this? Even Bcash supporters must acknowledge that he's an asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:28:32
Most of the up to 100k people that have signed up daily on the bigger exchanges don't even know what a wallet is. They'll just keep their funds on Coinbase etc.

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:51:50
My gains as measured over the last three months would be down by $30k from the top in absolute numbers if I sold now. You don't know how much that means in percentages obviously, but I don't really bat an eye yet. It'll be interesting to see if the 12.5k support holds or if we go down further, but even if we do I'm pretty relaxed because I expected that before christmas / end of year.  
I actually partially cashed out my ETH stack here  
  
after it became obvious that this resistance wouldn't be broken and Bitcoin already showed signs of weakness.  
It would take me like a day to sell all my other alts and fomo back in later, in the end I'd be too slow and waste a lot of money on fees, not worth cashing out everything for like 10% profit during the correction.  
Gonna buy some more alts with the ETH profit when there's a clear sign that this correction is over.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:51:23
Wait a year
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:18
I didn't tell anyone to hold. The market has been flooded with millions of new users (some exchanges registered 100k per day) and they're selling what they bought at the top now. They're noobs. And they're panicking. Nothing wrong with that, but that's the reason we go down. People always assume something bad has to happen for a correction to occur, which isn't true. The market itself is the reason for this correction.
/e: btw I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist, that's only 5% of my portfolio. Heavily diversified in alts and keeping up quite good. Sold some ETH at $840 resistance where it was obvious that a correction is coming to buy more alts during the dip. I actually expected BTC to go to 12k, still waiting for a clear sign.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:11
What a shitlist, Jesus. Not that they're all crap, but there are so much better opportunities out there like VEN, WTC, OMG, DRGN, AION, ICON all of which will launch their chains next year. Cardano is great but massively overvalued already and needs a few more years before it's ready.

@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:43
FUD until proven otherwise. Could be a ton of reasons, from the mentioned display bug to compromised computers to false claims for whatever reasons.
People probably don't understand what a blockchain, a wallet and fees are to begin with, I only looked at a few comments but that became pretty obvious. Also, all of those are very different issues, making it more probable cases of PEBKAC.
I can definitely say that their support is superfast and competent, and of course there's "deafening silence" on their side when at people ask questions in an unofficial sub they hardly look at. reddit is not the center of the universe, drop them a mail or join their slack.  
If there's actually something shady going on, that's super simple to prove (and would thus be super stupid on Exodus's side): Look at the transactions from an affected address. It's 100% transparent, and yeah, blockchain is law, that holds true even if you don't understand what it means or don't want to accept it because it means you made a mistake.
Also their fees are transparent, and so is their business model.

You'd have to check the code and compile it yourself to begin with. There's no guarantee a commit is safe unless it was audited by several independent parties.

So you chose to waste your time by making useless remarks instead? You seem to have issues with your Ledger as well, so I assume you're indeed incompetent and Exodus is fine. You're blaming others left and right, also see your Coinbase remarks. You seem to be a very annoying person overall. Also you're trying to make a point here, so at least try to provide actual evidence better than "look, here's a few people with issues but no details whatsoever". Your "evidence" is anecdotal at best.

It would take the hashpower of the three biggest pools combined, with everyone participating, to pull of that attack from what I see. Why does he say Bitmain could do it? Also I doubt the mass of miners would risk their income.

I assume you're dumb, because you talk like a republican. I'm not even from the US.  
Of course everyone can theoretically get rich (just not at the same time), but not because Bitcoin is a magical vehicle that distributes infinite wealth. Everyone getting in later makes everyone richer who got in earlier. It's just like any other asset.  
What it does is shift power, that was Satoshi's goal. Getting rid of financial institutions as a middleman.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:18:24
Congratulations, you're completely missing the point of Bitcoin: it's trustless and eliminates the middleman. You're mixing up fiat, crypto, banks and exchanges to make an incoherent argument with a flawed comparison.

Imagine living in Venezuela instead. Or Greece during the last crisis where everyone was locked out of their bank accounts first and then withdrawals limited to 2000€.
But yes, it's deflationary by design, so its value should go up. It'll stabilize the more people use it though, so people won't have to be afraid of missing out if they spend it. And it's not like currencies don't move.

- Protection: thanks, I'll pass  
- Backing: by what? Where can I exchange my money for what it's backed by? If there's a crisis banks simply lock people out of their accounts and don't allow access to their own money, see Greece. Or does that fall under "protection"? If money is so super stable because it's backed by something, why does it do this only because of some trouble in the EU?  
  
- Volatility: what's the limit for acceptable volatility? What will the Euro be worth if the EU *really* falls apart?  Does it suddenly stop being a currency then?

Somewhere between 8m and 80k if he was leveraged 100:1, which is quite likely. He probably made way more in previous trades, so he was probably gambling for fun here. It's still satisfying to see such big shorts get liquidated since it moves the market though. There's a reason this isn't allowed in many forex markets, iirc 50:1 often is the limit.

I'm still not sure if I should be happy that the movements are currently that boring or afraid because of what's ahead. Support around 8100 and sentiment in general really has taken a beating and although there's as many buy orders down to 8k than sell orders up to 9k, the momentum of closing longs as we approach 8k could just rip right through it. People seem to prepare for another pullback to at least 7800, so I'm hoping for a positive signal from Korea to break the current downtrend.

- How was the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash sold?  
As in sales from December 2017 to February 2018, upon consultation with cryptocurrency transaction experts, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash were sold in a manner that had no effect on market price and not by ordinary sale on an exchange, while ensuring the security of the
transaction to the extent possible.
- Are there future plans to sell Bitcoins and Bitcoin cash?  
At present, nothing has been determined regarding the sale of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies split from Bitcoin (collectively, “Bitcoin, etc.”) in the future.
- Will the Bankruptcy Trustee pay off with Bitcoin, etc.?

It's possible they traded huge amounts at a price that made it attractive to hold the coins rather than directly selling them in a bear market and also attracted buyers that otherwise wouldn't have bought. But yes, they didn't directly affect the price, but likely indirectly by reducing demand.

Something to note people probably don't want to hear: many altcoins bottom out simply because their trading volume is going to zero. When I filter my portfolio by anything with less than $100k of daily volume, it's 30% less than the theoretical total. Nobody's selling when there are no more buyers left. I have a token trading on a single exchange which is worth $5k in theory, but I can't sell it. It would take the price close to zero.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:41:52
Then Bitcoin will be worth trillions and widely used. What's your question again?
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:29:26
And who do you think they're buying those large amounts from OTC? It reduces demand, but also supply. Volume is gone because the markets don't recover, and it's hard for markets to recover without volume. EOS dumping also affects BTC, less than BTC affects ETH but they're still coupled.  
Main issue probably is the regulatory uncertainty which keeps fresh money out of the market. Retailers (dumb money) won't return without smart money making moves.

They somehow seem like the guys you usually meet at far-right, conspiracy theory or anti-vaxxer gatherings. Using catchphrases they can't explain, yelling at people just trying to present the facts until those give up, then they think they were right from the beginning and "won". And behind their backs, they're screwed over by the people they support. That's why often feels like and why I unsubsribed in the end.  
That being said, I guess not all hope is lost if you can actually manage to separate them from the yelling crowd.

Imo the person (or group) going by the name Satoshi knew that just creating some kind of electronic cash wouldn't be enough to change the world. Who would follow the crude idea of some geek (let's just assume it wasn't a state actor). He had to start all this and then suddenly disappear to start a cult around him, like some kind of crypto Jesus, and he probably anticipated that people would get religious about it. He kept the whitepaper vague enough so people could argue about what his "true vision" is and start a fight, and that drama would attract even more people and prove the resilience of the real Bitcoin against all attacks. So he planned all of this a decade ago which means he's more intelligent than we can imagine.
Either that or he was a fat neckbeard who fell down the stairs after ordering pizza on his way back to his mom's basement.

I don't like that because it's somehow mocking people who really suffer from massive devaluation of their currency, like in Venezuela. When Bitcoin's price increases, you can still buy the same amount of bread with your dollar. They actually starve.

Yeah you're right, people don't want to hear it though. This will continue until Bitcoin either crashes or stops growing so fast and is more widely accepted, or major issues with fiat arise in a bigger country. Right now, it's used to buy cars and houses in working economies because at those price levels, people think "it's enough" (or think they can avoid tax). Anyway rising prices also mean more incentive for shops to accept it, so it helps adoption in a way, even if it's not used much. In its current state, it's not usable as a currency anyway, way too few transactions, the mempool would explode.

Yes, they fucked up in like the worst possible way. Nobody reviewed the code, nobody took notice of that critical change. That's not even a bug I guess, just a bit confusing. It's just that nobody cared.
And that's what core means when they're talking about not rushing things. This has been public for months. Also says a lot about that "broad support" 2x was supposed to have. And now they're pushing another untested, undocumented hotfix from slack. You can't make that shit up.

They won't name B2X BTC unless B2X keeps the majority of hashpower for some time. So B2X has to win first before it officially becomes BTC.

Bitstamp, they're as close to a bank as it gets.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:41:20
Imo it's not. Exchanges like Coinbase actually protect you in this case, they'll make sure you don't double spend and stuff. And you can sell fast if you need to.  
Good luck trying to transfer BTC or B2X to an exchange with lots of people trying to do the same while it's totally unclear where the hashpower goes. It might take forever to complete a transaction, or cost horrendous fees.

Enforcing the same currency on countries with completely different economic power without the option to to devalue their own currency to stay competitive (sorry if I didn't get the financial terms right, English is not my first language).

Because everybody was waiting for a correction after it went up 150%, and here it is. Perspective matters.

@_date: 2017-11-12 09:00:35
Correct, bounces up on the way down are normal. We have the biggest red weekly candle in history and RSIs look pretty okay though, if this was over now it would be a healthy 25% correction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:58:26
Core agrees 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:42:44
Miners follow the money. BTC's value is determined by prices on the big exchanges, it doesn't have to be transferred for that. If anything, people can't move BTC to exchanges for selling, so supply dries up and prices increase. B2X will die right away.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:04:34
Still fine up to 1d, 1w not so much though. That correction down to 5k everyone expected would have been healthy.

This sub doesn't show from it's best side right now tbh. We don't know what's up with Bithumb suddenly going down and all the wash trading, we're not calling people dumbasses for buying Bitcoin at the top, let's keep this civil. I unsubscribed from for this kind of behavior, a lot of people not involved in this battle might be losing money and it could well be an attack by another entity than we expect, like the banksters. Whatever just happens reflects really badly on crypto if people outside our bubble get aware of the heavy manipulation going on all the time.

Cryptocompare shows very different volume numbers compared to Coinmarketcap, can somebody explain that? I tend to think that Cryptocompare's numbers are more realistic, and that would make the whole USDT discussion totally ridiculous. One thing I can say for sure is that often BTC pumps are lead by Bitflyer's JPY pair and not BFX which can be seen on the cryptowat.ch 1m charts for example.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:38:06
Bitcoin always finds a reason to crash or pull back. Anything less than 20% isn't a dip worth buying imo.

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:04:49
First rule: don't be greedy. When 100% profit isn't enough, you're gambling.
/e: normally I'd say take some profit, use it to DCA down with the correction, but with the amount you initially invested that would seem a bit odd. Just wait for the next major correction and get back in then. Missed profits aren't losses.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:15:22
And give alts a chance to rise -.-
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:04:02

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:12:28
It's down 25%, what are you talking about. If it goes down to 4500, it's still in the healthy correction range.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:29:00

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:43:43
Forget about the fork for a moment - does it seem like a good idea to buy something that has gone up that much in such a short time? Literally everybody expects a correction (i.e. a temporary price decrease) now or soon. Even if BTC goes to $8500 now first, that's just around 20% from here. So yeah, it's a good idea to stay flat for now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:51:32

Because you actually want an exchange, and technically it doesn't matter if you're using their website or their app to access it. But if you're looking for an app, there is one. And the Coinbase app is fortunately pretty usable. I guess you'll still have to go to coinbase.com for registration though, and you'll have to upload a few documents. If you're not from the US and/or don't have access to a computer, things might get more complicated.

He's not gambling, he's protecting 12 million customers. He can't just say "the legacy chain will be Bitcoin, forever" if the rest of the world should move on at some point. Chances are people will keep BTC, sell B2X, miners keep mining BTC because they have to. If it doesn't work out that way, he'll do whatever he has to do to protect Coinbase's customers investments. It's not about politics or religion, it's about money, which is pretty much the only thing that can save the legacy chain at this point. It's right to let the market (i.e. the users) decide, not exchanges or miners.

CME futures are cash settled, not touching BTC at all, so to place a guaranteed successful bet on dropping Bitcoin prices, they have to short actual Bitcoin, and huge amounts of it. Other hedge funds might simply do the opposite.
That'll mean a lot of buying/selling of actual Bitcoin &gt; increased liquidity &gt; less volatility after all.
Also iirc the futures' spread is limited so it wouldn't make much sense to bring Bitcoin to its knees.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong:
Afaik you can run a core node on a cheap Raspi. Increasing the blocksize increases the chainsize, memory and CPU requirements (or time required for validation) and bandwidth used. Blocks are mined every ten minutes because that's a safe period in which blocks should be propagated and verified across the network at least once. The longest chain is determined by the nodes that see and verify new blocks first. By increasing the requirements for verification, faster nodes determine the longest chain. Consensus is primarily defined by nodes, not miners, so that's even worse than mining centralization.  
Iirc the chain is broadcast via shortwave and satellite to locations with really bad infrastructure. The goal is not to exclude anybody, Bitcoin is global. That makes the network secure. Ripple for example is the opposite of that.

Many consider it a precursor to an ETF, which would add so much liquidity that the large scale manipulation we see now would finally be reduced.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:23:56
So stocks are fake money in a bubble - sounds right.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:54:37
What goes up must come down. Like it does now, but worse. If people really think we're going straight up, better not listen.
Also, everyone seems to think CME future trading is a guarantee for a slingshot maneuver from moon to sun to mars. It might as well backfire badly and take us back down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:48:31
My bet would be in the range of 6000 to 5200. It made a 40% drop because of China, I don't see it going down that far this time. 20-30% would be reasonable.

Net neutrality affects the foundation of the internet, the actual physical network, not just the software layer that is the world wide web. A project like Substratum can build a decentralized web, but is still heavily affected because the communication happens on those physical lines. This is not a problem blockchains alone can solve. Or you could achieve the same results without blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:53:23
Kraken isn't really into communication. It's eventually more promising to contact Fidor bank and maybe even the german BAFIN, although I doubt they're responsible here, and exert some pressure. They might be interested in what one of their partners does if it reflects badly on them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:58:15
Last correction was 40%. Would take it down to around $5000. RSI on bigger scales is still way too high.

Bittrex because of its good reputation and choice of coins. Same for Binance.
Kraken because of margin trading, cryptowatch interface, security and fast SEPA transfers (still love you just fix the performance).
Cryptopia for small gems (others call them shitcoins). When you're just starting, being listed there really helps.
Kucoin because I hold KCS and you should too and also trade there so I make more profit.

Who's "they"? You borrow margin funds from a p2p liquidity pool using USD(T) or BTC as collateral, that's why you pay a flexible interest rate based on supply and demand. Bitfinex isn't involved here. If they wanted to pull off some large scale manipulation, they could do that a lot easier.

That's what it's supposed to look like. A few random shitcoins always pump and dump during a Bitcoin correction. This time the wash trading on Bithumb helps. If BCH was traded on more exchanges with more fiat pairs, things would look different.

The GPL is discussed a lot, many consider it failed and it's used less and less because it's effectively doing harm to the FOSS idea. Even those who are still using it criticise it a lot, and Linus is one of them. Many people probably only used it because it's been there first without understanding its legal implications (including companies like Linksys) and now lots of bad projects nobody's ever gonna put any work in again are stuck with it.

It looks stupid, but it's probably people closing long positions (voluntarily or because they're liquidated) as major supports break. 7250 was a major support. Doesn't mean there's no fuckery going on leading to this, it seems to be driven by either Bitfinex or Bitmex.

If you look at actual exchanges, there's a lot of demand and books are pretty thin on the way up. Most of the current price action is orchestrated from Bitfinex shorts intentionally pushing the price down.

1) No it wasn't, I doubt most people even heard of Lightning.  
2) Amount of transactions is still relatively low, people aren't "using" BTC but investing in "digital gold".  
  
3) where are fees high, and compared to what?

Nice try
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:00:13
It's actually oddly satisfying that Bitcoin's moves become less and less violent. It may look brutal on smaller scales, but in the bigger picture we've just been oscillating in a ~10% range lately. If the bottom doesn't fall out and we stay above 7200, I'm still cool with these moves. The question is what will happen at the end, we either have to break up or down. My guess would be up since we're running out of sellers below 8k. If we just keep going sideways and Bitcoin is "tamed", that would at least be good for alts.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:04:09

@_date: 2018-03-29 23:06:57
Looks about right for me. Less buyers but also less sellers, so lower volume but still a drop. Either that or shit's really about to hit the fan :-)

It will have an impact because people think it should. It's not logical because Bfx is way less important than half a year ago (also look at Bitmex volume for example), but that's how it is.

It's way less, actually. Many are lost forever in wallets without keys and so on. Actually, BTC might be one of the scarcest actively used resources on earth. The people that bought pizza with some BTC some time ago might be the people that bought a house with some BTC in the future. There's a reason it has 8 decimals.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. Bitcoin also is not really decentralized, because most of the mining power is in the hands of a few companies. And it will be even less centralized when settlement layers are in place.  
So, by your definition, BTC will never moon. That's not a bad thing, BTC has its place, other cryptocurrencies will do that.

I used to hate them, but after they fixed their performance issues for the most part, I'm fine. It's still a bit laggy sometimes, but they increased their trading volume like mad, that's BFX/GDAX level now. Also, the cryptowat.ch interface is just awesome.  
  
There's a trade history, so I'm not sure what you mean. Some smaller bugs remain, and I hope they increase precision and re-enable the advanced order types soon, but considering the influx of new users, they did wonders.

Serve as a global currency. I understand your point, but the transition won't happen until it's reaching some kind of critical mass. Its real cap (excluding all the lost coins) would have to be in the trillions. Volatility is also heavily reduced with more volume and value, no single entity could bringt down the market (except Satoshi and some other super-whales).

With the limited amount of data per transaction, it's eventually so low quality that you can't even tell what it is with certainty. I'd like to "see" some actual research data (of course I don't want to see cp, just give an example of what the decoded data generally looks like).


They didn't even bother to research that part but just claim that it is the case. Also, if they want to nit-pick, they're already guilty of an offence just by doing the research as well.

Unfortunately, no law will ever stop people from being assholes. Currently there's a case of a guy who filmed a dying biker after a heavy accident instead of calling an ambulance, then after someone else did that, he even interfered with the medics because he wanted to keep filming. Then he left on his bike. Fortunately, a dashcam recorded this. Unfortunately, dashcam recordings normally cannot be used as evidence in Germany because it violates people's privacy. Fucked up situation, but I guess the court will decide to allow the evidence in this severe case.

I have no strong opinion on that, I'm just a user who doesn't really care about Bitcoin's political and religious fanatics.

It's not a serial chain of validated blocks but more like an interwoven tree-like mesh (the tangle, or technically a directed acyclic graph) where each transaction validates other transactions, which means massive scaling. It's like the hulk, there more action there is, the angrier (faster) it gets. It doesn't replace blockchains though, it solves different problems in a differet way.

No it wouldn't, I guess you're referring to the market cap, but the calculation doesn't work that way. You can use it to compare cryptos among each other, but not anything else. You can't even use it to compare it to the stock market (which is also way more valuable than all currencies in existence, and Apple alone for example is worth more than 50% of the USD in circulation). First major reason being that stocks don't just get lost, while a lot of the BTC in circulation are already lost forever.

Nothing's really wrong with BCH, they actually have a point imo when they say that this is at least partially what Satoshi envisioned. The market chose BTC though, and the EDA (difficulty and thus block times jumping like mad) is probably not quite legit, although it's probably needed to keep the chain alive.  
It's not a technical issue, it's a political issue. They say is censored and driven by economic incentives, and I don't really have a lot of nice things to say about them. is like with even more conspiracy theories.

A lot of trading doesn't happen on the books at all (OTC, dark pools), also arbitrage and margin trading have to be considered.

If the majority of miners moved to 2x, why doesn't mining the legacy chain become superprofitable for the rest, because the difficulty never catches up (I mean down) fast enough?  
Also there are tons of chains which are less profitable than others, still they are mined.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:25:49
They claim that they want to let the users decide, which means the market. If that was true, they would just implement replay protection, do the fork and wait how it turns out. With their hostile attempt to destroy the legacy chain, they prove that this has absolutely nothing to do with what users want, they just want to enforce their opinion on everybody.

Not being sarcastic here, do you still adhere by your market prediction after the CME announcement or did you close the short? You said your stop was 6600 and you would short more at 6400, that's not too far away now but that was before the news.

The dip is probably also caused by a lack of buy power because everybody's currently going for ETH. BTC is trading $200+ higher in Japan, where ETH has no relevant fiat pair, than the rest of the markets.

Of course, but the definition of possession and where liability actually begins is to be discussed. They even say there's no specific laws or court rulings so far, still they claim there's universal liability, and not only for cp btw. but "for any objectionable content", as they also list things like bibles (which are illegal in some places as it seems) and so on. They better should have focused on technical aspects.

I read the article, otherwise I wouldn't have made that statement. It's very sensational with all the "she has a baby" and "he 75 years old stuff", but on the other hand very clear on the actual issue: these people fell for a scam and leaked sensitive information to a fraudulent third party. In the end, as bitter as it may be for them personally, it's their own fault and not the bank's. If this happened to my mother I would be mad as well, but I wouldn't blame the bank. They were actually pretty accomodating in several cases. And what do people expect, a hand written apology for something the bank has no control over?

If Bitcoin actually was a global currency and would be worth 100k, Satoshi (if he's a person and still alive) would be the richest man (or woman) on earth. If Bitcoin even went to a million, he'd be pretty much a demigod and could do whatever he wants, like the destruction of any market including Bitcoin. That's one reason why Bitcoin will never be a currency, unless some state actor knows who Satoshi is/was and what happened to him. Too much power. Apart from that, he didn't solve the distribution of wealth issue. He just created a payment method independent of central powers (which is probably debatable to begin with, but at least it's not in the hands of central banks).

They're also banning advertisement for other speculative financial products like CFDs, so cryptocurrencies aren't treated specially here.
It's sad that the NYT skips that part and adds "The restrictions on cryptocurrency advertising are similar to limits Google places on other forms of ads, including the promotion of counterfeit items or sexually explicit content" instead, which makes this look like someone had an agenda here. Daisuke actually should know better.

Still you come off like someone who shouldn't work with such an amount of money. I don't care if you're successful or not, just like I don't care if Bitcoin goes to 100k or 100. You're emotional, so you'll get burned at some point.

It'll be called B2X when it really hits the market though. Then, wenn the dust has settled after the fork, some exchanges like Coinbase will look at it again, and if it sees major adoption might call B2X BTC or at least Bitcoin (Bitfinex said they couldn't just use BTC for technical reasons).

It's being manipulated, but today was just a regular sell-off driven by GDAX. I actually followed the 1m charts side by side the whole time because it was quite funny to see GDAX trading $200 lower than any other exchange. That was organic profit taking in an otherwise bullish market after Bitcoin rebounded and rose too quickly from its previous low. Anybody else increased their long positions, Kraken even ran out of margin funds which didn't happen for a long time as far as I'm aware.

Actually the transactions can easily be traced and the funds frozen the moment they arrive at an exchange.

@_date: 2018-04-25 11:36:52
It's also different than the other drops we've seen recently. Long positions have increased sharply on Bfx and price is driven by GDAX this time, which are strong indicators for simple profit taking. I'm bullish until we drop below 8900.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:24:01
It's supposed to solve the scaling issue by fitting more transactions in a block, but it's not a long-term solution. 32MB blocks won't be enough in the long run, so make it 64MB. Spike in transactions, that's fine, just make it 128MB. Then 256MB. 512MB, 1GB... every block has to be broadcasted and validated throughout the whole network. I'm not sure if you can still run a node on a Raspi, but you'd need very powerful hardware and especially a very fast internet connection to keep up, that excludes major parts of the world from running full nodes. Imagine an initial sync of terabytes of data on a slow link. So if you're into centralization, block size increases are for you.  
It's better to fit more transactions into blocks of the same size via compression and efficient organization of data and move small transaction spam off-chain.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:03:28
It wasn't the wallet that has been compromised though, it was the very foundation of the internet itself. And the risks of its current centralized design go way further than that, when you're controlling the BGP routes, you can do some *really* bad stuff way beyond such a simple attack. You could probably even create valid certificates or split a major part of the network to separate nodes from each other for example. The current system is broken and these attacks happen way too often.

Please stop this "it's manipulation" bullshit every time the price goes down. This is provably completely normal at this point and different from other price movements we've seen recently. We're still higher than on Monday, and if we stay above 8900 that's actually pretty cool for price appreciation. Do yourself a favor and don't look at 5m charts.

Sharp increase in long positions. Bulls aren't out of the game yet.  
  
This drop is driven by GDAX as it seems, normally Bfx leads the price. So it's probably really people taking profit after the gains we've seen. My very broad portfolio went up 100% during the last two weeks, that's not exactly normal (yeah, in crypto it is, but not healthy).

Many know Bitcoin, some have heard of Ethereum, noone knows the rest. Also Bitcoin is the oldest and most mature coin, so it is considered pretty secure.

He should better make estimates on when they'll fix their infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:08:44
I hope so.
But I doubt it.
But I still hope so.

tl;dr how fucked are they?

It's low quality. So sad.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:10:57
Could you elaborate? Witnessing Kraken's failure brightens my day, they fucked me over often enough.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:17:13
if Bitcoin fails, do you think Ethereum wouldn't suffer?
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:40:26
Buy high - sell low. There's a reason most hedge fund performances aren't great. Smart money isn't actually smart, sometimes they are lucky or succeed in market manipulation.

There's no con, even if BTC crashes it'll recover and ascend to the moon in the long term &lt;/bitliever&gt;

That was in 2017, and while they had performance issues, at least they didn't lose everyone's funds. Kraken is trustworthy and the Cryptowatch interface is great.

Better ask in those are the BCH guys. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:36:53
Yeah but it's still down 80% and we're still in a macro trend down.

Try Deribit. Last time I checked it was cheaper, faster and open to US customers.

Which site is it?
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:25:19
The documentation is pretty clear on this.  
This is an API key: 
This is a private key in the context of Bitcoins: 
And you honestly shouldn't get in touch with any of this if you can't figure that out.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:12:06
Not Kraken.

EOS might be one of the biggest scams in history.

Say thank you Bitmex. I somehow doubt that timing's just a coincidence.
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:35:03
It's Bloomberg. Expected nothing, still disappointed.

I feel like I sent him off the bridge with a broken bungee cord :&gt;
Especially since I don't know what's going on there after the fork. Which chain do they support now?

Might take a while. Expect a correction soon, taking alts down even further. We've had eight green weeks in a row, that's extreme even by Bitcoin standards. I never expected it to casually crawl through the mother of all resistances like that, especially with the Tether and Binance FUD.

The ETF could still be denied. Actually the probability for that is higher than that it's gonna be approved.

You mean tech stocks?
