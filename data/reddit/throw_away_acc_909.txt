I posted this in the Coinbase thread but basically asking the same question.
Basically back in early 2016, I bought some second hand Radeon 7970s and r9 280x and been mining ETH since it pretty much launched. Back then you basically made like 1 ETH per GPU per day. Back then a 280x mined at like 27MH/s since the DAG was very small. Even my R9 270X mined at like 20MH/s.
I kept all this ETH, along with the free ETC, sold all of my ETH/ETC when it peaked at $400 last Summer and went all in BTC. BTC went 5x since that time. Also got the free bitcoin forks.
I kept cashing out a small amount with bitcoin ATMs and basically quit my job since it wasn't worth the hassle.
Now I want to buy a house but I am worried about sending $1,000,000 to an exchange like Gemini/Coinbase/Kraken/Bitstamp and have them freeze this BTC.
I am worried they will ask for employment papers and I've been unemployed since 2016.
All this money was made legally. However since I mined to an exchange instead of my personal ETH wallet, I might not be able to provide a signed message proving I am the one who mined those coins. Since all the coins were mined directly to my Poloniex account. I do have receipts for some RX 470s that I bought last year and wondering if its sufficent. Do I need to take photos of my mining rigs and show it to my exchange as proof?
I know I can buy USDT tether but I am worried that its not really backed by anything. I also don't know if any of the Bitcoin Future Options will be sufficient since they might carry crazy premiums for the puts.
Wondering if people had issues withdrawing large amounts.
