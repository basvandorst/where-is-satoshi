I invested yesterday at 13k.
I won't gain MUCH but... I'll gain. That's something
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:26
Christmas. Many recent buyers just want quick cash for gifts.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:53:32
Currently at 5.2k

If I can buy for a billion I have more impact than a billion people investing one dollar. That's how you control the price. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:24:30
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:23:57
Yeah but as soon as they control the price it becomes fiat just as the dollar or the euro. Or did I miss something?
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:17:43
... dude I can't. I meant that institutions able to invest for more than the whole community can easily impact the price. That's kinda literally what's happening right now.
The whole point of cryptomoney is to be decentralised so that it can't be majorly impacted upon by a single agent, in order to have a sane economy. As soon as one agent can choose the price, that balance is off.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:14:16
Well don't use that money to buy virtual coins. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:21:05
Your nick is literally BTC4Trade, and you've apparently been here for 6 weeks. I'd say you're the insecure one. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:31:55
Okay fiat was the wrong term.
However if they control the price, it's no longer decentralised which was the whole point.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:33:32
He's probably stuck on the charts hoping to sell his BTC for higher than ATH. Picture him in underwear with a mix of redbull and coffee.
Or he's like me, at work with quite no shit to do. But you're right. Don't feed the troll. I should have remembered.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:19:02
What decentralization is there in a mining that is limited in reach (since there's a limited number of coins to mine) and/or in a currency that is owned in very very very large number by some organisations?
I'm just asking because I'm genuinely interested. I don't feel like btc is decentralized if groups like mtgox can pump value up and down whenever they want because they have more than anyone on earth can dream to.
Point is, you can't have a currency worth fiat be independant from said fiat. If you can buy coin with dollars, dollars WILL impact coins. Or if I'm wrong, please explain to me.

Username checks out
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:57:49
If you try to drive the price down, it's because you want to BUY. If you want to sell, you need the price to be as high as possible. 
Especially when you already have 50btc.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:26:18
Man I wish price had stayed at 11.400
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:49:55
Hodling doesn't cost anything, since I see that money as lost. 
If it ever goes higher, I'll probably try to get my money back. Seen how things are currently, it's probably for 2025, but whatever. I followed the only rule I understood : don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Thanks for your compassion tho :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:13:27
Yeah. Great. Bought ath at 17k. Don't worry. In 5years you'll be happy you bought.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:25:59
I bought ATH. Don't worry.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:56:03
You know, a "deScentralized" world sounds like a world with no scent. And technology can totally turn over, we no longer use telegrams. (Not the app)
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:38:59


Can you elaborate? If everyone on earth uses BTC, and everyone has 500 satoshis, but mtgox has 500k btc, how would their impact be "limited" ? 
How do you transition from "there are a few whales making up 80% of the market and a few thousand enthusiasts making up the left 20%" to "Every one uses it", when the price is so high most people can't dream to buy enough for a correct use?
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:39:35
Nobody uses it. People hoard or speculate. Noone uses it to buy food, clothes, pay rent or whatever.
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:00:46
I didn't understand half the words you use.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:54:08
Simply put, it depends on how much you can "lose" right now.   
I've invested when it was ATH. I knew that money was lost. Now I'm sitting on a few cents of bitcoins. If it ever raises higher than when I bought, I'll suddenly have money.  
Can you afford to lose, say 500$ right now ? Do you believe Bitcoin will raise higher than its current price in a future not too far ? Invest. Otherwise keep your money.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:41:37
Bitcoin is as convenient as a gold bar.
@_date: 2019-10-03 05:05:37
There's a lot of place you can't use it. Please try to understand instead of trying to be right. Bitcoin is not as convenient as fiat, currently.
@_date: 2019-10-09 04:44:16
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:58:29
Guy probably bought after that fud
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:33:25
Yeah, if I had know back then what I know now, I would be rich. 
If if if.
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:26:55
Well hit 5k before 100k.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:35:55
did too. Two years ago. Don't worry.
@_date: 2019-02-12 06:02:43
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:44:55
Should I feel insulted? :/
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:49:15
Listen here, Kvothe. Dollar cost averaging works when you KNOW the price will rise. If it only go lower it doesn't make sense to buy, and if you aren't sure it will rise, it's tricky to know when to buy and when to sell.
I'm not a true believer.
I've bought because of fomo and I'm here because now that I owe some of this, I'll stay as long as needed to get my money back, if possible with interests.
I had no idea it would crash the day after. I had no idea it would take two fuckin years to get back at the same price.
But yeah, I get the idea. If I ever invest again I'll follow it. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:10:03
Everyone who held starting six month ago, that is. 
I bought two year ago. I'm at 30% lost.
Not complaining tho, two month ago I was at 75% lost. 
I'll be waiting for the 10% gain in two month.
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:25:12
Except back then it was worth 75% more ;(
Source: bought back then
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:46:07
Yeah I still don't get that. I've read everywhere about how bitcoin is the future, it will replace the banks, cure cancer and paint the moon in pink (at least I guess that's why people repeat 'to the moon' all the time), but I still don't get how.
The massive pull and pump we've experienced make me feel like even if it's decentralised, it's totally controlled, meaning we can not be sure there will ever be a bigger raise.
So like OP, I HOPE it will reach 20k again but I honestly don't believe it much.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:11:17
The fact it's phrased exactly as my previous post but tells the opposite idea almost word for word makes it a satire tho. 
^maybe I just ^wooshed myself right ^now
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:48:36
Love the satire :)
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:54:20
Calm down everyone.
Nothing prevent the price from going lower ever tomorrow. Don't throw your economies in it right now. 
Remember: don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:48:53
Thanks for the joke.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:36:50
It's "bad news" because it looks like Google doesn't trust crypto, hence Bitcoin.
That means the lambda user will think "If google is not behind it, it's probably a scam". 
That's also why having Amazon support (random example) would be "good news" : lambda user would think "heck, if Bezos takes Bitcoin, there's money to get there!".
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:46:18
I meant for Gdax, sorry. Coinbase has a mobile app, obv.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:32:02
that's probably my next step indeed. Just sad there's no mobile app for ~~coinbase~~ GDAX
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:55:19
They don't. Survivor bias. For each person making money, there's someone losing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:50:24
That's called a forest fire. Easy.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:35:49
Well, even if, there's no 30% difference between those markets. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:03:09
I was discussing with my father yesterday and he told me that bitcoin was "corrupted" by the fact you can speculate on its value.
Can someone explain to me clearly (and not with faith kinda arguments) how/why bitcoin is any different from fiat, since its value is directly based on fiat? 
Why should I invest in bitcoin rather than gold for example?
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:51:59
Anything of value that can be traded. Is bitcoin more secure than money ? More stable than gold ? 
Is there any reason for me not to sell my bitcoin the moment I make a profit on it, aside from the theoretical hypothesis of a bigger, later profit ?
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:10:32
That does not mean much.
Borderless ? Yes, but it only works online. No way to trade it on a small market, or to leave some as a tip, or to use it for second hand trades.
Open ? Well again, it's open, but not distributed enough yet, so I can barely use it day to day.
Decentralized ? What does that even mean ? Right now we can see the price of Bitcoin changes day to day due to huge financial groups speculating on its value and manipulating the market to crash it or raise it according to their own agenda.
Is Fiat unstable ? Yes, looking at Venezuela, it obviously is. Is Bitcoin more stable ? Well...
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:02:51
No, I'm using gold as an example of investment one can see a long history of. I know gold has a value that will still be there in a few years. I'm absolutely not sure bitcoin won't disappear in five years from now.
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:20:57
Yeah well I bought near ath and will certainly not sell currently just to "help with adoption"
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:34:20
I still don't see how that's relevant. I know there are 21 million bitcoin. Great. How does that define the value of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:03:40
I don't see how that answers my question. There's a finite amount of gold too btw.
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:33:33
Is there a way to pass bitcoin from person a to person b without using an external software?
If not, how are you less subject to control than with a bank? Said software's owner/developer can "close it" anywhen. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:42:12
why until september only?
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:05:09
So... Its no better than anything else ? Cause the easiness to move it around is counterbalanced by the low number of people/trades accepting it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:42:38
Think about it this way: I bought ath so I'm at 50% loss.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:50:02
How/Where am I suppose to find those keys in CoinBase ? ._.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:04:22
Well since that's the amount I bought at, I'd like you to be wrong ;(
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:23:12
Yeah the thing when you've lost a thousand bucks is that you think twice before spending more. Since I would only have broken even, that would have been a bold move for zero gain.
Plus I don't have money for that right now so ...
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:36:40
I have my crypto on coinbase. What are my options to Secure it and/or trade it easily when time comes?
(I'm sitting on less than a thousand bucks so don't ask me to buy a 2k wallet ;) )
Edit : Since everybody still advise me to buy a wallet, I'll go further : I have no idea how to use a wallet or what it does. I only bought via Coinbase because it was easy and I wanted quick cash. Thing is, I bought ATH (december2017) so I'm pretty much fucked.
However, as long as I don't sell I haven't really lost money... So I'd like a few explanations :D
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:50:27
I read that as Segway and stood wondering why there would be any correlation between crypto-money and lame-ass transports
