Aww dude I don't have a dad but if I do I did I would totally spend a bunch of time figuring out how trade and buy and just talking about it. 
That's dope man, appreciate your pops
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:26:02
Yah lol it's a trip but I find it fascinating to see how the current btc culture really has no idea what they're doing LMAO. 
Back in the days, this community was poppin though. People had a basic understanding of the coin and why it existed . Now, it's overrun by dudes who bought some btc and feel they've learned it all smh.

@_date: 2019-07-17 17:48:03
And how many Libra can be made?
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:40:44
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:17:14
Bitcoin was created to keep them from controlling the property, the ledger, not the value. The value follows simple supply and demand laws which are the real drivers of value.
That's besides the point.
What I'm trying to say here is that Libra SHOULD be shot down. Congress is doing a good job. The issue is now cryptocurrencies are on the spot light because of Libra. 
So let's just hope it ends well.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:56:14
Get over it TrumpLover! No participation trophies for little bitches like you!
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:41:48
You can make bitcoin illegal though. There's countries that have already made it illegal. I feel bad for them, their people will be left behind financially.
Your comparison of a thought to Bitcoin is ridiculous though. Bitcoin is great and all but it isn't "like a thought" that's just incredibly naive.
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:37:55
Right... So you're saying Libra WONT be controlled by database administrators and is indeed CRYPTOGRAPHY?
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:08:52
My exact firs thought .

Lol nah this is legit .. man has this community really been taken over by noobs!??
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:35:33
True. Libra is terrible for the financial world.. a true disguised mark of the beast.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:40:54
Someone sent me this on Insta and I laughed.
Just another article written by an author that likely has never owned Bitcoin past a few days or ever at all.

Nah. He's just an idiot.

@_date: 2019-07-10 05:53:21
no yeah that's cute but you obviously haven't been around long enough to know that BTC has retraces and bull runs as a way of building wealth... Your graph shows a very unlikely shot to the sky for no apparent reason.

I never said it was a bad thing. Trust me I got all kinds of security features put in place for both my crypto and other assets. 
I just really hate banks. Can't wait to get rid of them altogether.. fucken thieves
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:22:09
If it's not decentralized then it isn't what we mean by "crypto" today.

Thank you! I fucken hate CB. Their fees are stupid as fuck
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:10:20
I never said they were stealing your money. Apparently you're incompetent. Far worse than mentally ill.

@_date: 2019-07-17 17:49:01
Agreed... But hwy, can't save them all.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:04:02
Nah. Congress is not like the Supreme Court where you can hire a bunch of lawyers and go at it. When Congress is not feeling you, they have the power to make a law to control future developments. This isn't good for crypto at all. If Congress decides to make Bitcoin unlawful based on the same principles, then we are all going to lose A LOT of money. If you don't think that'll happen you got another thing coming. Congress is full of people who have no idea what crypto is or why it exists. To them, crypto is still running amok and they can totally ban it if they wanted to believe me its political science 101.
Mark is about to lose a lot of money because his coin is not decentralized. Meaning the government isn't going to allow him to create his own currency and his own centralized bank that isn't American. That makes perfect sense because what Mark is trying to do is gonna have the Federal Reserve's toes very stepped on.
To us, its just a "coin" but it isn't really when you think about it. It isn't just a "coin" it's an actual "digital dollar" that places this so called "Libra Foundation" as the Central Bank. 
If you don't get it it's all good its not a simple subject because a lot of factors are involved when it comes to money and the control of it by the country that uses it. Just know that this can go very good for actual crypto or VERY VERY BAD.
@_date: 2019-07-13 19:57:42
Lol you make no sense.. makes sense that you support Trump

Lol not free of fees either.. Coinbase charger nasty ass fees
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:35:35
Dude you need to go back to school. Clearly you don't understand what the Legislative branch in the U.S does.
Let's get something clear, Facebook's "new currency" is a terrible idea and that's a fact. You wanna talk about how the US dollar can be printed indefinitely? So can the "Libra" coin! It isn't any different from a US dollar and if anything guess what it's backed by? GOVERNMENT CURRENCIES AND SECURITIES.
IT IS NOT A REAL COIN.
You come in here and talk about how you're "anti-US dollar monopoly" and who knows what else you're blabbing about. Supporting Facebook's Libra is THE VERY SAME THING for the exception that you're supporting CORPORATE control over YOUR money! You couldn't be any more ridiculous.
You're just another Zucker excited about trading in your US dollar for a shit"coin"
Look, go do your homework about this new currency, learn about why Congress CAN decide what happens to Bitcoin here in the US (Not saying they should or that it would be a good thing. Just saying they can.), and ultimately, learn to keep your mouth shut if you're a fucken noob who doesn't understand the difference between actual cryptocurrency and a currency disguised as a one.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:29:06
Libra isn't crypto
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:58:31
My girl said I'd trade her in for some Bitcoin. I asked if there were any offers. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:33:33
Don't even bother explaining. People are so used to being robbed of their money they are uncomfortable when it isn't happening
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:49:41
Then you sir, are severely confused as to what I mean by "it's not crypto"
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:00:05
I stopped reading at that point
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:42:50
That's similar to what the creators of Google heard from their Harvard professors

@_date: 2019-06-28 02:23:02
If you can't wait then sell and don't buy back in, honest advice
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:25:20
what bank do you have??
and maybe not necessarily.. There's likely a simple explanation. Are you sure that all of your info is correct?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:22:03
i'll check it out
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:19:35
sweeeeetttttt... I'll look further into it
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:45:54
I bought at about 13.2k and don't feel bad about it. In the long run, it won't matter ��
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:21:51
Bitcoin hit 11,350 plus and CB never caught up.. Can't trade on there.. I'm done with those thieves...
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:21:43
yeah but I wanna get away from CB as much as possible now... their fees are wack and they have weird corporate behavior I don't like it.. They have a burned fee into the price and also a fee to buy that's just silly
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:29:57
takes days to get my money into the exchange...
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:09:46
Yeah be careful with taxes .. Its not even worth it sometimes
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:10:00
Sweet.. Which do you recommend? I see one for 50 dollaz
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:45:41
Look above for my explanation
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:11:59
lol nah chill .. sit
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:32:40
nah "cuuuzzzzz"
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:45:27
This bull run wasn't like the last one. Last time it rose and then dropped back down to about 3500 or so. This time, it rose, then dropped, then rose again, then dropped and now it's hanging out around 10.5k to 11.5k.. This is a sign of a growing interest in bitcoin from the general public. On top of that, it is no longer just people on Reddit and the dark web who use bitcoin, big companies are now offering bitcoin on their apps like Cash app. So, the bull run yiu just saw was a spark.. Wait for the eruption! HODL dude... Get paid.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:57:06
You know, i actually do like Cash app but today i ran a little 20 dollar experiment and sure enough i couldnt get enable the withdrawal option.. its gltichy. sis you have issues or your experience was better?
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:32:06
FUDDY AS FUCK IN HERE - IM OUT
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:51:43
hmmm yeah okay maybe.. I did wanna get a Trezor actually now that you mention it..
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:06:49
Lol! oh dear lord... fucken reddit
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:07:05
I never said overnight mah dude. But yes, it will rise again..
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:21:07
Then why does it cost me around 5$ to move it out of an exchange?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:08:08
aight maybe I need to email them and check it out or something ...
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:57:24
No I think you have to sell. It would be cool if you could but you can't. Cool thing about it though is if you sell there's no fee to sell and your funds are instantly available so the worst case scenario is you'll have to tap into the app real quick and make a quick sale..
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:20:28
SLOPPPINGGGGG   its 10.5 ranow
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:56:50

I fucken love Cashapp.. I use the card as my "budget" card actually. I add cash, put away my actual bank card, and both buy and sell bitcoin on it if I want to make some money but Nontheless it has helped me so much with budgeting. They make it extremely easy to move from bitcoin to fiat too. Instant!
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:08:05
weak hands
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:05:32
EGSSSSACTLY... let us know how it works out!
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:26:17
Yeah! Lol they are moving people into crypto and making them comfortable buying and selling it easily like same day action shit. Best part about it,  they do it so simple! You sign up, they verify your bank account pretty much immediately, verify you as a person to withdraw, send you a nice simple card that you can put your nickname on if you like, protect you from overdraft fees and random bullshit, and allow you to add cash instantly and withdraw it Instantly for a few cents or free if you're willing to wait a few days. AND ITS ALL SO SIMPLE. no random shit, no random fees, no spammy emails.. Love that shit
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:23:12
it's in Euro though...
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:27:18
I have some bitcoin but mainly Litecoin!
Wanting to get me some more bitcoin though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:52:38
lol fucken old ass post... its like 13k now
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:42:34
Thanks.. now how do i get around that? I want my property asap
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:20:45
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:05:59
Try buying a coin like Litecoin which is relatively stable right now... 
A "halving" is coming up in 2 months and we're all expecting a rise in value so if you wanna see what it feels like to invest and play around with crypto, LTC is pretty much common sense to buy right now.. It hasn't gotten up in price much in this BTC bull market phase so rest assured that you're getting pretty much a reasonable price for one or a fraction of a coin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:08:51
Yeah I'm not saying Bitcoin is a bad investment. If anything it isn't a good coin to trade on a daily basis.
All I'm saying is that it isn't a great coin either. Fees are super high, and the chances of making good profit are mediocre. BTC is good for HODLn that's about it though.
For payments and every day transactions you want other respectable coins like LTC or maybe Ethereum
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:00:53
Finally someone that makes simple sense
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:07:04
hmm.. okay yeah i know of one near me maybe i'll look into one  actually
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:38:23
sketchy ass app... get out of there man
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:46:50
Yeah... but the terms and agreement says they are "still working" on some stuff and you "may lose all your funds" ... im good.. lemme know how it goes.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:16:02
Cash app is good... I love the ease of funds and how they allow you to add chas instantly and withdraw it instantly.. nobody else is offering that.. One thing though, I wish they also worked with Litecoin
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:12:45
fuck coinbase dude... Today finally convinced me to get off that platform asap
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:07:43
hmm okay maybe I just need to be patient then.. you were able to withdraw right? like to your wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:41:48
Then you sir, don't know what you're talking about.. good day... I SAID GOOD DEY!
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:55:44

These are always shit posts. The market or down right now just be cool.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:56:51
Because I like to trade?? lol AND because why wouldn't I want my shit asap?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:53:41
Buy LTC. It would take longer to go up in value but you'd make good money when it did.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:39:46
Bitcoin leaks money in fees and transfers. It's the first coin so it remains the most popular but it is by far not the best coin either. You can't even make real money unless you invest real money.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:47:24
