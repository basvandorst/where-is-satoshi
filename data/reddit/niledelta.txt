When you say explode I get worried, because it sounds like you're talking about a bubble... "today feels like something is about to INFLATE!"

It's only a ruse, they're in it for the sweet sweet karma.

21 Student. I've been watching bitcoin for the last 3 weeks almost religiously and I convinced myself it was worth putting money into, my funds finally reached virtex last night. $750  The kicker was, I had set it up as $100 in escrow before I went to bed just because I was too tired to really look into the prices and hoped maybe someone would buy, but after not being able to sleep because I was too excited to start trading I decided "might as well buy and start earning" so I logged back on and changed my trade value. went to bed and woke up to price sitting at about $95. I keep telling myself "it'll go back up, it'll go back up..." but there is just something also saying "you put in what you could lose and you lost it". it's not a huge chunk of change but I chose to learn trading over taking a couple summer courses. looks like I'm learning the hard way. I was aware it was going down but I thought it would reach ~ $150 and rise again, I set a modest 170 thinking I could hit close to the bottom and then start earning.
TL;DR 21 student, ~ $400

ha, was working all day, I sold last time it spiked to 130 (sold at 125, felt stupid when it kept going) and then I put in a few bids for much lower prices, a couple at 119, one at 100, and a couple at 90. kind of forgot about them since it was almost a month ago, then I checked my email today and have 3 from virtex "your orders have been filled" checked virtex and was so confused to see it so low after having a steady month of $125 (happy though that I ended up making a bit of a turn around) then I went to figure out why...
"silk road has been seized"
oh yep... that would do it... weird day :P

I wish I could casually tip $12,000

very sound advice.

virtex.com allows you to place orders for any amount for any price at any time for as long as you like, hell if I was really hopeful for bitcoin I could just set a sell for all my bitcoins at $1000 each and just wait.. and wait... but for me its about little gains here and there. set orders to buy at 90-100, sell them at 120 -130, we've been seeing this sort of fluctuation in the past months so its pretty easy, you just kick youself when you see the price went up or down your sell/buy points.

whoa whoa whoa!... Canadian money?! where is this wondrous machine? please tell me it's downtown Toronto! it would be sooo amazing if I didn't have to use my bank to exchange my bitcoins and $
edit: nevermind, I was using RES and didn't see the youtube title until now... I'm sad now :( does anyone know when one will be landing in Toronto?

You're welcome. I just thought it was quite interesting, from what I can assume since the bid from April 25th for 15 BTC was placed after the crash, it would be safe to assume that the 156/BTC is their breakeven point. And looking through the [Orderbook]( now you can see even more large sums popping up.

this is what I assumed they were, selling points for a breakeven that they just said "screw it, hopefully it'll bounce back eventually"

As a fellow Torontonian, what benefits do I gain from living in Toronto and using your website instead of other leading Canadian bitcoin exchange services like cavirtex.com (Canadian virtual exchange). what makes Toronto bitcoin exchange different?
