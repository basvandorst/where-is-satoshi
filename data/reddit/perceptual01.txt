I thought about busting the tinfoil hat out a time or two myself until everything really added up. I didn't get to mentioning the North Korea aspect that came out recently too. I wish more people caught onto this. Sadly probably won't happen. Posts are getting down votes like crazy.

I was simply making an observation on current happenings to see if anyone was picking up on what I was.. There are no laws on manipulating a decentralized currency and I'm not complaining, no victims here lol thanks for taking the time to comment

I've been researching into this since rumors of the China ban started. I know this can sound a bit on the tinfoil hat side of things but what if a bunch of influential wealthy figures around the wold conspired to bash btc for their own financial gain? Then in a week flip it to all positive. I.E. Government officials in china, news outlets and CEOs. 
Look up "Enterprise Ethereum Alliance". 30 + major corporations and even as of recently the country Of India is part of that.. Also JP Morgan has been increasing their footprint in china since 2016ish I believe. China has also talked about incorporating blockchain into their financial system.. Coincidence there with the recent news? Obviously this is speculation, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit.. There are no manipulation laws for a decentralized currency to my knowledge.

You can’t use coinbase through tor. It doesn’t matter anyways when your personal info is linked to coinbase. Don’t use btc.com either 
Use coinb.in

Interesting perspective. Gave me some things to look into. Although I'm finding it hard to believe that the Chinese government isn't heavily influenced by those same wealthy elite in the same way if not worse than U.S. politics is influenced by wealthy donors
