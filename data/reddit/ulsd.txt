have you just completely ignored my point to instead complain about the nature of open source so you can claim bch is copying? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:58:01


that's the reason why i'm sceptical.
it could be better than any altcoin if it's goal wasn't changed. so why was it's goal changed?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:33
yes, claiming it is solely a store of value when in reality it was never intended to be just that. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:45
it's when only a few miners mine bitcoin, bitcoin's network will come to a halt. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:54:20
difficult adjustment algorithm
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:12
so it's a store of value only for people who invested one year ago?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:32:11
ok will watch, thx.
well there are a lot of bitcoin forks out there. they all have interesting ideas to the scaling debate. it's true, some are pure scams but others have great roadmaps and developers behind them. do you want information on a specific bitcoin fork?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:09:18
$125 million new tethers were printed yesterday.

bitcoin in 2013 was peer to peer electronic cash, it had utility. after the crash people were still able to use it because of low fees and fast transactions. that utility was part of it's value.
bitcoin in 2017 is a store of value, it has no utility. it cannot do fast and cheap transactions. people are buying it because they heard it's gonna be worth 1 million one day. as long as the blocksize is not increased or the lightning network is successfully implemented its value will be based purely on speculation. this is risky for any asset.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:37:23
wow, misleading. with bch if you pay 1sat/bite your transaction will be in the next block. always.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:42:46
ok, he says some certain niches (i.e. exchanges) will have lightning in the first half of 2018. 
small payments for wallets will have it (quote) hopefully in 2018. payments in the 20 dollar range will have it (quote) hopefully by the end of 2018. 
thank you for your source.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:51:22
do not blindly trust people claiming amazing things. the prefix "bitcoin" has every right to be there in forked coins. a forked coin shares the exact same transaction history as the "original" coin til a specific block height. 
this guarantees that if bad actors try to influence bitcoin's development and thus turn it into something it is not supposed to be, there is still the possibility to fork and the true bitcoin lives on. please question more. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:55
give him a source. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:47:40
what makes bitcoin worth 17k or 14k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:10
are you deflecting?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:44
why would you need to change the goal of bitcoin, ever? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:34:49
bitcoin is open source, this means you cannot forbid forks.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:40:53
you can still get rich with bitcoin's initial goal: banking the unbanked. your wealth in bitcoin would additionally be backed by it's use case (being a currency) instead of soly relying on supply/demand. 
you could get even "richer" because market cap of gold is way smaller than market cap of fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:53:57
you got that wrong, buddy. maybe read it again? high fees should be a thing when all blocks have been mined. still +100 years to go for that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:31:01
bitcoin is intended to be a currency. if it's only use case is to sell it at a higher price than what you paid for it, then it's not bitcoin. it's not about the price, it's about adoption and usability. 
that's what andreas thought us.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:08:54
he also explained how to reverse the cap.
LN was intended for microtransactions, not as a full on scaling solution.
bch has 0-conf and 1sat/byte tax fee btw. it would be possible.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:21:33
so, like a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:05:51
i'll send you a pm regarding what i think of bch. 
i have heard too many incidents where people got banned here for talking about bch, because it is not the topic of this subreddit, which i respect. 
you are right, centralization kills bitcoin. if the fees can accomplish that it is a price to pay. the upgrades are interesting. would be nice to see them working soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:37:18
some certain niches (i.e. exchanges) will have lightning in the first half of 2018. 
small payments for wallets will have it (quote) hopefully in 2018. payments in the 20 dollar range will have it (quote) hopefully by the end of 2018. 
this seems more than a simple software interface.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:22:29
it shouldn't be called bitcoin then, imo. bitcoin's whitepaper was saved onto the blockchain, so future generations can see what bitcoin's purpose and intentions are. 
for me, changing it's use case is a big red flag. nobody seems to be bothered by this though. why don't we talk about this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:33:44
may i ask you some questions about how the lightning network functions? i looked into it and am deeply concerned about how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:40:05
thank you for the sources. i already visited most of them before. as i said, i understand how LN works.
what I don't understand is following:
1) how can bitcoin become more decentralized with LN. LN uses centralized "hubs" that act as a middle man. how can bitcoin guarantee that these hubs won't be run by corporations. surely someone could say everyone can create a hub and can make money with it, but this would be as efficient as buying a s9 now and mining from home. is the risk of hubs becoming new banks not too big?
2) when you open an off-chain payment channel, you need to send bitcoins to this channel (on-chain) to be able to transact off-chain. because core won't increase the blocksize, the off-chain fees would still be high. to open and close one channel you need to pay the on-chain fees twice. this smells like fees are being kept high so more people use LN. why aren't on-chain fees being lowered?
3) after opening and transfering bitcoin to my off-chain LN payment channel (and paying the on-chain fee) i can now do transactions. my bitcoin will actually not be transferred via those transactions. in fact, those transactions will be done with i.o.u.'s. for those transactions the user needs to trust the hubs instead of the blockchain. wasn't bitcoin created to eliminate the need of middle men?
4) if bitcoin changes most of it's transactions from an on-chain mining system to an off-chain lending system, isn't bitcoins pow being destroyed? 
are you not afraid that bitcoin is not bitcoin anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:04:39
could you please give me a minute mark to your claim, the video is over one hour long.
which one? there are a lot i support. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:48:52
bitcoin should do both. it was intended to do both.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:09:08
on chain fees will still be ludacris.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:17:47
not same tx rate. LN is speculation. 
if you believe ltc is better than bch, then surely ltc must be better than btc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:48:47






your arguments are not great.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:20
the blocksize is not the problem, it's the daa.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:16:19
[it would look like this](
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:35
"pretty soon" is not true. please list the source of your claim.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:07
well the value is going down, so..
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:15:29
you got that wrong, they say scaling should be done on-chain. microtransactions can be done off-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:51:22
all of you did. dreaming about lambos and not about banking the unbanked. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:04:57
no btc's daa adjusts every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks).
bch's daa eliminates the possibility of a chain death scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:17:57
nobody mentioned bcash. stay on topic.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:47:31
yesterday was bulltrap, today is return to normal. tomorrow, let's see.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:47
what? bitcoins intentions are it's true value. if you change those, it cannot function. look at it and tell me it works.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:39
you don't quite get it, don't you? the core team is not trying to fix on-chain transaction fees. fees will only increase if the blocksize stays at 1mb. to use lightning you have to first do an on-chain transaction. you will still have to pay a high fee to open and close lightning channels. don't you see how this resembles banks?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:34:33
bch's daa adjusts every block to guarantee a 10 minute block time. btc's daa adjusts every two weeks which does not guarantee a 10 min block time.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:25:44
bcash is not even out yet. did you mean bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:32:26
I second this, his youtube channel is a great source on bitcoin info.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:45:20
fear happened.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:57:31
yes, also tomorrow
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:15:28
just to be sure, buy bch too. and get a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:53:12
it's like saying bitaddress.org is a scam because bch and btc share the same wallet address. not at all biased.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:54:59
the party is at r/btc
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:12:04
bitcoin and bitcoin cash share the exact same wallet. do you even know what bitcoin is, what it stands for? do you know that every bitcoin address can receive btc and bch? are we gonna call bitaddress.org a scam website now? think for yourself for once.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:00:06
it creates bitcoin and bitcoin cash wallets. where is the problem?
