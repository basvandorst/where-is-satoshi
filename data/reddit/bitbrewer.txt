I agree with you.  What Bitcoin needs is some sort of platform that allows transactions universally.  Right now BTC is just not user friendly or convenient. at least not in U.S.

why not? you seem to be making a huge deal out of really NOTHING!

Agreed. Localbitcoins seems to be the safest way to buy/sell.  Look for sellers with positive feedback and reputations.  If you do happen to use Localbitcoins be sure to leave feedback on your experience.

Does it accept site visits yet? You may want to ask the 6 people that have signed up so far.

asked like a true member of the "entitlement generation" Why is SUCCESS viewed as evil in todays youth? Granted, there are some cheaters out there but the majority of those in the "evil 2%" became wealthy through hard work and taking chances.  Stop Whining and start WORKING and maybe someday you too can be a success.

ahem... ok so spending lavishly is wrong somehow? The way I see it when the rich spends money it helps those that are in business that provide the luxury items, for example the artist who makes the art that hangs on the wall. Lavish? sure, but the artist reaps the benefit. (Look up Reagan's trickle down economics) the more the rich spend, the more the economy grows.  So all those artisans and gardeners, and chefs, and musicians, and interior decorators, and fashion designers, and all the others that support he "lavish" spending of the rich are the ones that are benefited.  You can be frugal if you choose, but stop being jealous of those who are more successful than you

HAHA...I hope you slapped him silly while saying "Wake up you hippie liberal... unlike elves, Bitcoins are REAL"!

Even 1% would send the value of Bitcoin skyrocketing. Spread the word!

Economics 101: Supply and Demand
Basically it will be worth what someone else is willing to pay. and right now people are willing to pay over 200$ per BTC. Infinite? No... like the previous post said there will never be infinite demand.

I agree that there are MANY sites that are full of spyware. These are usually associated with the faucets.  However the Video and task sites are pretty safe.  Your recommendation is valid though.

I keep collecting BC with no intention of spending for at least 10 years.  Yes 1BC will see a value of over 10,000$ in ten years.  Just ask those who didn't think it would breach 10$...then 50$....then 100$.....then 200$. With over a century of mining still looming and as people begin to use crypto currencies more, the value will indeed keep climbing.
