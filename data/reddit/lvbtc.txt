Full nodes, AKA miners, are financially incentivized to run. Maybe the block size is part of doing business? Or do we not agree that the block size *has to increase*? [Lightning network developers surely believe the block size will need to be at least 155MB to support its use](

I deleted since I really don't want to get into length back and forths. It'd be nice if you responded with reasoning, like I did, rather than a decisively negative statement. You didn't teach anything because you probably don't know either. All I know is other cryptos can scale for years further than bitcoin without anything fancy.
Increasing the block size is very obvious at this point but I'll be here more or less to see how it plays out regardless. Been here since 2012 already.

This is how open source projects work. They all get better through each other's discoveries and inventions. When BCH implements it, the community here gets to learn from their successes and mistakes.

We have different viewpoints on it - I'm totally aware of how difficult these discussions are and still are so I appreciate your input. I'm glad we live in a world us nobodys can discuss it and learn.
Anything related to bitcoin development from an official standpoint should be *directly developing on the code* and making it more useful. Anything more-or-less officially part of the community and its leaders should have a degree of separation from private solutions, for the sake of unbiased long-term decision making. Entrepreneurs in the space can solve the other problems - even with something like the lightning network.
Payments using Coinbase to purchase was a lovely experience. Businesses compete to solve those issues. I believe there are major issues with the coin development itself being involved with any specific solution be it lightning network, decentralized exchanges, or whatever second layer may pop up in the future.
I think there was too much distrust by blockstream/core devs that the entrepreneurial space wouldn't come in and solve these problems (or at least not fast enough or in the way they'd like to see it happen) so they over-burdened themselves and crossed a few ethical governance lines.

Besides market leader and community, bitcoin is walking on very thin ice. One of it's most valuable assets is the ecommerce infrastructure I was here fighting to build for 5 fucking years. This subreddit used to cheer on new businesses starting to accept it rather than the price and anxiety-driven posts like this one from OP.
Get real people! Wake up before its too late! We need bitcoin to succeed and have real world usability for the moon to get here.
This is so obvious at this point. Many of us were trying to explain the impact of what Core's decisions will do since 2015! The decentralization argument was a false flag. No one with less than $20 worth of bitcoin can even reliably transfer money out. Why would a small time miner go for bitcoin if the fees kill their entire profit? With a $20 transfer fee, it makes more sense to buy into crypto through Eth now too! This mem size creates more centralization than ever known before and destroys most of the benefits we used to preach:
* peer-to-peer online transfer of wealth
* banking for the 3rd world
* cheap/free international remittance
* tools to obfuscate your transactions (these fees killed the coin mixers)
They're trying to rebuild the traditional banking system on top of a public ledger. Where are my anti-gov fighters that were here a few years ago?!! When did it become okay that bitcoin couldn't **do everything and have it all**? Why do we need so much layering and over-complicated solutions already put in place? Just make bitcoin the best possible technology for others to code and build businesses on top of - that worked!
I don't care if Core promises they'll add this or that. I want an IMPENETRABLE MONETARY SYSTEM THAT SAYS FUCK YOU TO THE GOVERNMENT. Anything else is corruptible.

Interesting. I personally have my holding spread across several coins at this point so it's good to see what you're thinking. "Facts" are in the mind of the beholder due to [a spectrum of biases]( we all are suffering from. It's the reason I frequent so many of the subs and actively participate in these discussions.
I still don't see why we can't have it all. That was the assumption for many years here until fairly recently. I agree with Satoshi that there should hopefully always be a time that free transactions can still make it through. There would likely only be upside to increasing the block size to 4mb.

I used to. It's about building the infrastructure of commerce around it so the entire thing scales to the point it's no longer so speculative - but actually practical. At 1% of the world's commerce, bitcoin would be priced at $34k per coin. The ultimate goal was always more than 1% and I think it's doable with how the internet has changed retail.
That $34k coin doesn't even price in the actual investors, and potential future investors, or massive $500bn remittance market.... or any of the other uses we want to see this blockchain bloom. Nope. We're settling for a highly restrictive and costly settlement layer.
All of that is being destroyed because people want their coin to be worth more RIGHT MEOW and the developers want to release their privatized products. It's sad. I don't want altcoins to gain market share. I want bitcoin to be revolutionary.

[Interesting catch.](
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:23:45
Good idea. I posted this too:
"A less harsh post to help people and answer these questions better.
1 - You need to know that failures in any crypto will likely occur, regardless of how long-standing it it (I even have worries about bitcoin itself, and Doge mining is a good example).
2 - The inputs of price are hard to predict but there are common trends. Things that generally only serve a marketing purpose (especially that don't lead to Wallstreet-type news and better education, commonly have little effect on the price. 
If something bad occurs (Silkroad closing) and there is a dip, it doesn't effect the currency itself and may even remove a cancer on the market... thus increasing price in the next week, month , etc. Any single news item will usually not increase price directly, the overall "mindset" (bullish/bearish) is the biggest determining factor and is the sum of all news. 
Things that increase investor outlook include new major companies/corps accepting it, new uses, better education (MIT is a good example), and longstanding time periods that there is no major bad news.
3 - If you hear something is rising, you're already too late. It may bump more, but also know when to get out if you're playing with altcoins. I successfully invested in both litecoin ($9 buy to $34 sell) and darkcoin but that's because I had very strong reasons behind why I think they would increase and I sold before I thought there was an imminent peak. Another lesson on that is... don't get greedy and the ride to the moon can't last indefinitely.
4 - Research. The teams behind coins, the purpose of the coin, the "Brand" of it, and many other factors will effect its price and success. Don't buy coins on cryptsy because they're popular. You can use it as a tool to research more into "why" they're popular. Many times you'll learn it's just a momentary pump. If you don't have strong reasoning behind investing in it, don't, or you'll be sad.
5 - Look at cryptos from a more macro-economic perspective, learn why they will likely be around 10 years from now, and don't think in short terms (unless you're making calculated guesses but day trading is very difficult). Cryptocurrencies by definition of decentralization will be around 10 years from now. A savvy investor would put BTC in a safety deposit box and forget about it. He may also keep up with news and new cryptos that could eventually overtake the throne.
6 - If you're day trading, be professional about it, not emotional. Have stop limits in place, keep track of each investing price and have a set % loss that you cut losses at (unless you have another educated reason to hold), and never make an emotional purchase to get on or off a moving train. You should analyze your overall success at the end of every week. Day trading is at minimum a part-time job.
7 - Doge has a great community but they have been blinded by dollar signs since the beginning. I've loved seeing the things they do (and I participate in, I love my Doge crew shirt) but there has been very little progress in infrastructure. There aren't enough entrepreneurs, and the developers really don't have a clear vision right now. It's a weak investment but that doesn't mean it's dead. It's well known and anything could happen.
In general, the consensus I get from these posts is you guys need to educate yourselves better. Both from security/risk standpoints and n the markets themselves. A venture capitalist researches the teams heavily before investing, not just the product. If you don't see the crypto here in 10 years, then you're playing with fire.
If anyone is interested, I can answer specific questions."

The one you seem to suggest would require people to control it. Bitcoin is decentralized and will continue to progress until an extremely useful and unique new technology is no longer valuable.
I care about how someone uses their bitcoin as much as I care about how people use their dollars - not very much.


You need to dehumanize the protocol. It doesn't owe us anything and it has no opinion or care as to what people use it for. It will exist today, tomorrow, and 10 years from now regardless of how it's used or people think. It's an idea.

Bitcoin's concepts are the exact opposite of the causes of Z$'s decline - decentralization, neutral to politics, transparent and constant number of units.
Z$ has no differentiating factors to any other fiat currency. The benefits of bitcoin and use scenarios are not only unique but also would be extremely difficult for a government to implement.
This is also not a fair comparison. Z$s were directly altered by their controllers, which led to its demise. At first, the currency did well. MTGox is an exchange. Nothing was altered in bitcoin besides short-term public perception.

This will be more of a federal interpretation, as well as, Canada's gaming board. Most likely they will both consider it gambling, and even if they can't prosecute you to start they would work towards putting the laws in place to do so.
Gaming is very protective of their reputation and it is always best to work with them. I'd consider this before putting money into tables, rest, marketing, etc. It woudl fall under online gambling, commerical gambling, both, or something new. I'd imagine there are laws in place that cover gambling with a commodity.

Volatility also subsides with a more diverse range of uses and the globalized manner in which price and liquidity is determined. Western exchanges selling may be a buy opportunity in the East. Equilibrium.
That said, the largest influence is market cap and it will likely never compare to the stability offered from the dollar.

With the distributed effect of the currency, a "pop" in western markets can be a buy opportunity in China. Look at this last "bubble" and the price. This is in effect already.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:07:08
Look for early adopters in your area via local meetups (email them) and possibly craigslist or localbtc. Localbtc is a great resource and I suggest it for most buyers. Other than that, you are restrained to coinbase, campbx, and bitstamp currently. With the price as it stands, buying in person at a premium is completely necessary. Otherwise, wait it out and sideline as many are.

1. Set a dollar amount you can responsibly invest.
2. Buy that amount / decimal.
3. ???
4. Profit.
Don't panic sell, stop reading the media's headlines, and stay true to your beliefs in bitcoin's future in this world. If things do change, take it into consideration and make your own mind on liquidation / buying.

Does it have to be PDF? Way too insecure to be sending bitcoin holders.

The issue of this method is it incentivizes a refund when the price goes up. I bought 6 shirts from Shirtoshi.com about two months ago. I received the inventory he had available quickly, but given their production model, I am still waiting on three more.
If I requested a fund with a 1:1 assumption right now, I would make a lot of money.

There is some bitcoin insiders interest in protoshares. Take it with a grain of salt but I keep hearing about it and am looking into them.
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:15:33
Doesn't hurt to potentially enlighten someone on a decision factor they might not have known. At the very least, I'll mention a test-ground and that they will still be paid in USD. I'd bet that a copany as large as Newegg has so many battles... that even an interesting one like this may be overlooked.
The companies who will directly be effected by BTC are the ones showing signs of unease or movement.

Hosting it as a business is a gambling house and has specific rules/laws to ensure customer safety. Hosting a poker tournament in your house is probably under its own legality which I am not sure of.

I followed bitcoin for 6 months but never created a wallet until someone tipped me in the beginning of this year. Funny how that goes...
@_date: 2013-09-08 04:02:03
That would be great. I believe this would be more of a direct to a decision maker type situation, but anything added definitely helps build a case.

It is the likely currency code for bitcoin. BTC is a shortform of bitcoin, while XBT will be the currency being referred.

This is not investment advice and I am not reponsible for your decisions. 
I believe any point someone invests in bitcoin right now will see returns for the long run. I also have witnessed peopel get crushed trying to day trade. I am still pro-investment in the space and still invest myself. Don't panic and define what your purposes are.
If you buy in, start with the amount of fiat you are comfortable with, disregard "have I missed it" and hold for the long. Look towards using it as a currency now and in the future. The people sidelining will always miss the boat.
It may, and likely, will crash. But to what extent and to what amount is unknown. This could be a great price compared to a week from now, or terrible. Leave some money aside to invest in the case of a drop to average out your losses. If it doesn't crash, then you're set regardless.
What's happening has never occurred before. It isn't even comparable to the previous charts. Disregard them, there is so much going on it's hard to properly explain.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:31:17

Well look at you, being super useful and informative. Thanks. I'd be interested in more personal meetups as well.
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:28:31
Well, think of it from the merchants perspective. Do we support merchants accepting it or only support them if we win every detail?
If a merchant liquidated your purchase, then what?
Alternatively, if the price goes way up you can ask for a refund because you want the gains (unfair for them to lose a sale like that) and if the price goes down they would need to have or purchase more BTC to meet market price.
Maybe a 30-day policy for direct BTC refunds? 1:1 ratio. This still is unfair if a person refunds due to price increase, but that could just be another risk for accepting BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:05:16
Agreed, but if there had been much of a change to effect that volume of population then the price would have gone even further and never stopped. That's my guess.
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:11:54

I'll go over it again, and I know this slide isn't technically correct. I tried to simplify what is going on there as much as possible since people kept getting lost with it.
I also disband going over what the chain is actually doing. I couldn't simplify it enough. So, that picture represents people transferring money instead. So, those are single transactions to go in blocks rather than the blocks themselves.

That is my worry.
But, natural uses will come as more users have available bitcoin. I don't want to "market" my company, but your question is directly into relation to my thoughts.
We are introducing bitcoin to a $140bn gambling market. Even a small piece of that pie would be very big for the economy. Basically frictionless remittance for gaming. Our players benefit from no cost transfers, increase privacy, removal of government and banks from their financial decisions and more. The markets fit.
I want to see more companies doing real transactions so we can increase this almost non-existent transaction volume baseline we currently have. I have high hopes for these types of uses in 2014. Remittance in itself will hopefully grow naturally, but we need to find more industry uses. E-commerce should continue to grow as well.

@_date: 2013-11-23 23:30:42
A result of our broken financial system. Inflation and centralized monetary policy/control has proven to be exposed to foul play.
This is why bitcoin is better. It is apolitical, decentralized, based on mathematical algorithms and certainty, and it is the honey badger of money.
Life works in mysterious ways. Forget direct investment and find your opportunities. Being relentlessly resourceful creates luck, opportunity, and results.

Hi all, I had dinner with Bobby Lee and would like to go a bit further into this topic.
I asked him to explain what the finanical institutions are like there. He said that there are 4 sectors, I believe they were *metals (gold)*, *real estate*, *commercial*, and *consumer*.
You can not go to your consumer bank and ask for a housing loan. These are strictly sector-based financing and are separate.
The news about China basically announced a new sector. *Cryptosecurities*. China now has 5 financial sectors in which Bobby basically holds a monopoly in one. This is actually really great news, which I was bearish about beforehand, because they can regulate bitcoin completely separate from any other groups.
He mentioned that he thought bitcoin would be opened to the potential of payments in the future, but that is completely up to the government. In actuality, no one really knows how they are going to regulate bitcoin moving forward, but we are all hopeful.
EDIT: I'd also like to mention that I was thoroughly impressed by Bobby and his brother. They are very genuine and nice people. We are really fortunate to have them in prominent bitcoin roles.

Thank you very much! We all got along really well which helped. Here is a copy of the questions I generally asked: 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:37:43
Make a white label internal exchange for bitcoin companies. We would look into using it if we could set parameters. Basically a management of USD / BTC on the balance sheet.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:01:38
They wouldn't apply. It would likely be an auxillary business wallet that facilitates which coins will be exchanged on your balance sheet between USD / BTC with limits to what exchanges need to be pushed to external exchanges.
There could be cool analytics to help a business acheive most profitability since internal exchanges maximize your margins. Currently, a company would ned to create that system themselves and use wallets with best guesses. This could really help with the analytics piece.
Alerts when you are nearing a bitcoin or USD threshhold. Set a percent or amount you want of each.

Yes. It's a necessity to Bitcoin's success.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:50:43
Bascially in internal exchange that takes care of our internal exchange of bitcoins when we don't use external exchanges.
