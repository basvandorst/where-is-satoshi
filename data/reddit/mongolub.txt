Thanks for your reply! I didn't know about the selfadjusting. I was worried that as time goes by, the possibilty to mine a bitcoin will become more and more diffult,eventually leading to a point where even high end computers would become non-costeffective.

I am using bitflyer. It is not exactly 0 fees. They charge you when you buy bitcoins with cash, and now they are on a temporary campaign where you can trade for free.

You seem to be knowledgeable, so serious question: What will happen if mining will not be profitable anymore? Isn't this a major risk to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:22:28
It's entirely possible you lose all of your investment. Never put in more than you can afford to lose.

How long does a transaction usually take? Serious question from someone who bought his first coins a month ago.

Bitflyers registered capital is 40 million USD and they work closely with Japanese megabanks.  It will be strongly regulated and only a few players allowed but that does not mean the thing is dead.

Maybe he's got thousands of bitcoins but no job?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:13:07
Feels good man.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:41:47
Why not buy every week what you can afford to buy?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:13:50
Never sell. Use it or buy it.

A lot of mining is done in Siberia.

When it will be 10,000, 3500 will sound dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:41:06
Yeah, when even the next door hobo knoes so well about bitcoin that he'd prefer it over cash, it's time to cash out.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:20:12
Japanese bitflyer is trading at 2500USD for days now.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:28:22
I share this view. That's why I am still buying even at this ATH. Everytime I get salary I put part of it in BTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:27:31
Maybe just a rich lazy fuck trying to buy without effort. Nobody knows.

RemindMe! 6 months " losing 75% value "

 Like this sick beat.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:11:28
You're not selling.
I am buying.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:25:12
I don't. I think we are at a point where the shift to mainstream has really begun. I think this (around 2000) is the new bottom. But that's just speculation.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:10:46
Why would you sell something when it's cheap? Now is the time to buy.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:30:56
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:17:08
I understand, I also was pointing out the fakeness of this thing.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:32:09
Well I can only speak for myself but I use Bitflyer and they offer Amazon gift coupons to buy with btc on their site. I then use those to buy daily necessities.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:22:06
You’re never going to buy in at a higher price?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:26:14
