Thinking 2FA is bulletproof is foolish, you should still be very careful

This is what I don't get about crypto. The most ignorant people are always the ones "investing".

I'm on mobile but look up DUT1

Huh? The "U" stands for "universal" not "US"

No, and that's precisely why none of us is running a Bitcoin exchange.
You know it when you're not competent enough to accomplish a task, and if that's the case it's your responsibility to just not do it, **especially** when you're dealing with fucking money.

Thank you! PM sent :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:28:07
ok then!

That I don't know shit about economics
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:18:18
Not really. IEEE 754 double-precision floats have more than enough precision for **storing** Bitcoin amounts.
edit: added emphasis due to downvotes.

No, when you need to actually do math with bitcoins, use fixed-point numbers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:51:42
Because you can look at the source
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:56:39
What is this website?
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:33:16
Haha, reddit experts...
