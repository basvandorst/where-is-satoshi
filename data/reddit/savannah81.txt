We also aren't sure if it's fake though.

Those people are just opportunity grabber, you cannot blame them. Many of humans grab opportunities, and that year was an opportunity, and they grab it.

I prefer bank because I think that is more legit than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:56:52
We cant do anything about it, miss the good old days man!
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:58:08
So what happen till then? 
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:55:05
How though? 
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:03:27
Yes and we aren't sure that the exchange that we are using is not one of the mentioned in the post.

But he would take a long time though to get to a  high mark.
@_date: 2019-03-27 22:57:14
Gambling? For a beginner? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 07:13:16
But I think that is possible. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:39:07
Agreed.

I do hodling but scared of trading. Maybe it's funny but it's true. My friends introduce me to it but I didn't know anything on how to do it. Maybe stick to hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:00:35
Like what? 
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:05:30
Mine also half half, but the other 50 percent goes to other physical businesses. The first 50 percent goes to hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-21 22:16:04
Indeed. Dreaming to buy a car though.

I know that's a joke but don't be hard to yourself :&lt;
And oh, trading, haven't tried that yet, I'm afraid of it.. That isn't something to be proud of,  eh? 
@_date: 2019-04-13 00:39:46
Well, he can do hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:08:20
Yeah, an ironic one. A trader must not have that kind of thinking haha. Obviously only lucky guesses with no data to back it up. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:28:54
So you're a gambler too? Well for me gambling sites are all the same, they are all gambling site. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:26:58
I agree, and it is because it is better than old payment systems people know. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 21:16:04
I also see that. By the way, how do you think are the possible ways for that to happen?
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:54:29
But that will just bring him stress though, better stick to hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:16:46
That's my dream too, but it is still too me a long way to go.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:55:21
Like what? 
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:38:37
But he is learning though..
