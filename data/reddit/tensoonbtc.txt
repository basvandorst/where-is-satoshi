The answer is at the bottom about 1.7 to 1.8 times as many. see [Towns](
In answer to &gt; Double the amount **and an extra 30% once Schnoor sigs are in place**
Schnoor will only affect the Witness part which is 25% of the total, so it can have at most 
* **without sig aggregation** 42% of 25% = ~10%. So 1.9 - 2.0 times as many transactions. probably less though still worthwhile.
* **with sig aggregation** won't change these figures much. 
Schnoor won't do much for **maximum** tx's per second. but it will be great for
* consolidating UTXO's in your wallet (extra sigs are nearly free).
* getting the **average** tx/s nearer to the maximum. (large space hogging tx's are smaller, nearer to ideal)
* edit and signature heavy tx's multisig etc.

What are you going to do if segwit2x is the dominant chain?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:15:44
that's BIP148, UASF not Segwit
There is a difference between a **thing** (Segwit)
and **how** (UASF) a thing is activated.

Then stop using them.


yes you are, you are giving them economic relevance.


It is arrogant, presumptuous, and problematic for Junseth to tell them what to do with their business.

heh heh, u/Cryptolution is a top bullshitter his posts are mostly hot air and appeals to authority virtually no content.
he will be accusing you of being a "dunning kruger" next, [link](
or when people actually call him out on his bullshit he gets amnesia






he's happy to insult and dismiss evidence when presented [original post](

It'll pass. 
Were you sad when Satoshi left?

How was it generated?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:24:27
Bitmain were never against it, don't believe all you read..
* **2016**: They signed [Hong Kong Agreement]( supporting Segwit activation
* **2017** They signed NYA where a central clause was activation of Segwit.
You decide if they are against Segwit
