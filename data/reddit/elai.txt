I got a feeling this guy does not practice what he preaches.  The average poor person with no bank account in a developing nation pays no taxes of any sort, since enforcement is lax at that small beans level.  Yet things are more corrupt, broken down and dysfunctional in those countries than the developed nations where there is a fully functioning tax collection system.

Due diligence is only for fraud of the buyer.   The slave laborer merchant-manufacturer like Chiquita usually still realizes customers are their lifeline and will probably not screw them over any more than any other merchant. Be large enough and they'll take you out for dinner sometimes too.
As the bitcoin ecosystem develops, merchant escrow and reputation services will develop and people will start using it to avoid problems, just like mastercard/visa.
I think only concentrating only on developed nation manufacturing is culturally self serving.  Chinese manufacturing can make quality items that are not disposable, they just have to be given the budget and directions to make such items.

No it means you need to not use marketplaces and exchanges where you do NOT have to trust them with your currency.  Half the point and success of bitcoin is you not having to trust an institution &amp; people but math and an expensive computer network instead. 
Non-trust based exchanges and marketplaces will out-compete trust based ones like mt.gox exactly because of these issues. It's being developed by guys like open-transactions and such. 
And besides the point, mt.gox has been unreliable for years and especially recent months.  You should of gotten your money out 6 months ago.
Regulation just means changing the trusted parties in many aspects.  With regulation you get Argentina, US quantitative easing to infinity, the FIRE industry growing to a monstrous +%25 of the GDP and so on.  Banks are so entwined with government they might as well be pseudo-governmental organizations.

Many banks use fully automated identity verification services that have been rubber stamped by regulation authorities.  So for example you would provide standard info such as name, address, tax id, etc.  Then you would be dumped in to a questionare that asks you such things as where you lived, worked and so on based on your credit report provided by the credit reporting agencies.  If you pass these things then you don't need to photocopy ids and so on.  He is also applying for bank accounts locally.  Many of bitstamps answers could be replaced with a few multiple choice answers that you would see on any brokerage application.

Because to be honest, anyone who is competent enough to realize the implications of actually starting a bitcoin bank/exchange realizes it's absolutely terrifying because of security and does do not do it.
As a result all you have left are the incompetents and russians who don't have to worry too much about extradition.

Well it also has a permanent public record of transactions, store forever everywhere.  Bitcoin + strict exchange KYC/AML = tax collector's dream.

For everyone saying, but how about Litecoin ASICs!?  
Litecoin asics are estimated to only 5x better at most because of the memory requirements of scrypt, and they'll be significantly more expensive to create compared to bitcoin asics.  So if someone creates a litecoin asic, it will be very expensive compared to a GPU or equivalent bitcoin asic and it wont be 80 to 500 times better than a GPU like bitcoin asics are.

Legal tender is about paying taxes and what you can force people to take as payment for debts.  People can be refused to be paid in Euros or gold coins in the USA for debts, but they cannot refuse USD in payment for debts.

If that was actually true, then google wallet, paypal, banks, etc would not be on the app store.
Apple is a large corp, some higher up made a policy decision years ago that bitcoin == sketchy silk road stuff &amp; something like zynga bucks and they have been enforcing that decision ever since. They probably thought about for a sum total of 1 hour. Kind of like congress. Those higher ups will have to change their decisions for this to go away.

Bitcoin is really nice when you want to send money across borders too.  It's the lowest fee and fastest way to do it I've found compared to anything else unless you start getting into $30k+.   Literally being able to buy BTC with coinbase, send it within 20 minutes and the other side being able to cash out next or same day with their local BTC exchange and pay %1 total exchange fees is a bloody miracle compared to whats available currently with things like paypal and international wire transfers.
After $30k+ you can start getting almost free forex rates with something like interactive brokers, but it still takes forever to get your money transfered.  It's also incredibly time consuming to do and you have to pay a monthly minimum fees with IB to keep the account up.

I'm thinking about the 1099 misc.  it's when they give you over $600 for sales and withdrawals,  not when you give them over 600 for deposits and purchase.

And if litecoins get ASICs, it will only be a 5x improvement max unlike BTC ASICs.  I think once BTC ASICs hit 28nm/23nm and reduce their price down to normal CPU levels, I think that is when this exponential jump will flatten out a bit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:02:58
I think they have to report giving people money over $600 in any case.

Well since your 'produced' them you can pretend they cost you 0.  When you cash out you can call it bitcoin income and leave it be.  That would be the simplest way to do it.
You have 2000 BTC in various wallets.  You've exchanged x BTC for $5000 for the year of 2012.  You would report it as $5000 dollars of miscellaneous income.  You take no deductions and you pay whatever tax you owe for $5000 of income.  This would minimize penalties since you've paid the maximum tax in the case of an audit.   You maybe could do it as capital gains, but you would of had to keep a history of your transactions and how many units, even if your 'basis' is $0.
Pretend this is money you gained by selling world of warcraft gold.  You played the game ('earned the income') by turning on and managing miners (WoW bots harvesting gold) and trading with other players in the game to increase your WoW gold (day trading), and then cashed out by selling the gold on eBay (exchanging bitcoins for USD and putting it in your bank account).   See how MMO gold farmers / character builders in the USA dealt with their taxes.
Not an accountant/lawyer so take a huge grain of salt, but that is the simplest way I can view it.
Also if bank account deposits is all you have for records, I would mark the deposits from the exchanges and do that as proof of income, including emails possibly?

I always wondered where all the money that government print goes, and now I know. Printed money goes to large banks, for basically free, or it's used to pay for government contacts.

To reduce the effect of the early adopter advantage or large amounts of coins being lost in the early days.  I really like how PPCoin is setup actually by trying to avoid the miner arms race and increase power efficiency with proof of stake.  It's too bad the developer didn't choose scrypt as the hash-cash setup initially, that would of made it an even more egalitarian currency.
I think what people like about deflationary currencies like gold is that it's physical properties prevent it being fucked around with by political forces and the elite.  If a currency is predictably inflates, and cannot be fucked around by politics or be subject to surprise supply creation, would people care as much?

I also use it to avoid eating junk food and stick to weight loss diets to great effect.  If I want candy, I have to go out to the store to buy it.  I never put snack food beside my computer unless it's near zero calories.   If want something more significant, I have to get up to do it.  The very act of just having to stand up and break focus decreases food consumption a lot.

People keep on saying 'wallet competion'. But there are many wallet apps already on the app store, such as google wallet, paypal, bank software, dwolla, etc.
It's the 'illegality' association that bitcoin has that has caused them to adopt this stance.

You can do the entire business deduction thing and so on, but the thing is, he has shoddy records so if he gets an audit, he's going to have a bad time.  It was a hobby.  It's safer to pay the maximum tax now, avoid penalties, and then possibly do an amended tax return later with more details if he can compile good records to get the tax back.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:12:20
It's bubble behavior, it's really not good.  For example investopedia defines it as: "Unsustainable investor enthusiasm that drives asset prices up to levels that aren't supported by fundamentals."
For example you don't get nearly as many self-assurance style posts saying that you should buy now, because it's gonna go up up up when there wasn't a sudden big jump like this.  These posts pander to people's FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) instincts and can lead to another BTC bubble. People  start doing stupid things like saying 'i'm going all in to BTC' and then putting all of their savings into BTC.  I've seen multiple posts like that in the past.

Couldn't you theoretically just change the bitcoin software to remove the creation limit and make bitcoin mining not have a limit, therefore making it an inflationary currency?  Enough people would have to download the new client, but seeing how centralized development is already, it is a possibility.
