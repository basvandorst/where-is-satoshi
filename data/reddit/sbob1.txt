Yea, I never doubted that he was right; that said I've had to return computer items for being DoA since I started in the industry, and continue to. I'm gonna keep focusing on the good news and let others e-mail asking when they can expect their unit. And if I get a defective unit I won't be thrilled, but I will get it exchanged.. good thing I got a few of em huh?

Oh yea? I doubt it's from cancelling, any shipping they have is from a year ago, the people that were willing to wait and got the better units.. You should read about them more.. Have you heard of any dead units? I haven't.. What bricks?

LoL -  - newb, go complain about your 53GH somewhere else. Just because I am glad to hear something about the unit I purchased doesn't mean I don't know that some times a unit can die(never had a GPU die in your miner?). Way to act like a big boy.. keep thinking your trolling numbers actually mean something
