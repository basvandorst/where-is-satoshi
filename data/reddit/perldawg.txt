This is the smart take. People debate the practical ideals of crypto like it's the driving force behind valuation, totally ignoring that essentially all new capital introduced to the market is approaching it strictly from an investment perspective. Some day in the relatively distant future these tokens might be exchanged regularly, like currency, but for now, and the immediate future, value is determined by investment participation only. The market grows because new people put money into it. Basically every new person entering the market starts with BTC. Nothing BCH absolutists say or do will change this. BCH will be subordinate, like every other alt-coin, at least until Blockchains start being utilized in day-to-day life beyond investment trading.

It's not there yet (and likely won't be for a long time, if ever). Businesses of any decent size need to have smooth, fast access to cash flow. Unless all of you're vendors accept it, BTC has to be converted and available as fiat asap, which payment services do at the point of sale. A business owner could try to do it themselves, but it would add to their already massive work load and happen at the end of the day when the price has almost certainly changed, maybe for the worse. Small businesses especially make their way on very small margins and the volatility of crypto is a very dangerous risk to take on just to avoid the payment processor's nominal fee (which can be factored into the price of your product).

I traded mine in shortly after the fork at .21BTC. How close has it come to that since?

The point you're missing in your breakdown is this: at the point of the trade the exchange is equal, there is no gain or loss and there are no taxes due as a result. The only exception to this is when you trade coin for fiat; if you pull dollars out, and your remaining holdings are &gt;/= your initial investment, you have realized profit and owe tax. It really is that simple.

Thank you. I've heard several accounts of businesses openly accepting BTC on the street in Vietnam.

BTC-e had a big pool of money that was used in the commission of crimes and a ledger of people who they owe money to (account holders). Your account is/was not an actual separate pool of money, it is/was a notation of debt owed to you. The police seized the money used in criminal acts, it's not their concern that the company who's money (their money, not yours) they seized settles it's debts. BYC-e owes you money, not the police.

True, the funds may not be lost for ever, but I think, given what details are known, expecting access to your funds right now is ignoring the reality of the situation. I've obviously shown my bias in assuming the assets have been seized, which I do think is most likely

Fair enough, but banks are also subject to much more regulation. I guess I'm mostly objecting to the general attitude that Bitcoin is this magical libertarian ideal that should forever remain free of regulation, followed up with cries of outrage when the realities of that ideal result in negative impact

In your scenario the police would certainly keep the car at least until the investigation was complete and most likely through the end of any prosecution. Here's a better analogy: you know a guy who acts as a currency exchange and you give him some money to keep track of for you. It turns out this guy robs banks on the side, adding the stolen money to his exchange business. One day he gets caught and he's got his exchange clients' money in his pockets at the time. The cops don't care how many people claim they didn't know dude was a bad actor, they're going to hang onto all that money because it was in the criminal's possession at the time of the crime.

I reiterate: it isn't your money, it's the exchanges money and you hold an IOU

The common man doesn't always expect reasonable things. Let's get a drink sometime...

Not at all

I certainly can't fault people for wanting their money back, that's for sure
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:42:46
Your efforts to get them back should be directed at BTC-e, not the police.

"Could I use/sell my Bitcoin Cash coins while keeping my BTC?"

For sure, there's a lot up in the air right now and it'll probably take quite a while for everything to shake out. It's not as wild west as it was when Mt Gox happened, but the crypto world is still a long ways from smoothly integrated into established societal norms. Cryptos are considered assets by the IRS so, if they're treated any different by the justice system, I'm sure there will be legal recourse

How many times have I heard "when you keep your coins on an exchange, they're not your coins."? The exchange used the coins you gave them (their coins) to illegally launder money. Their assets were confiscated as a result. Now you want to complain about the authority that seized the assets? You can't have it both ways.

BTC-e had a big pool of money they used to commit crimes and a ledger sheet of people they owe money to. The police seized assets involved in criminal behavior. People's problem should be with BTC-e, not the police.

This is the internet, man. You want to prove or disprove something? Get your Googler fired up and go nuts. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:36:49
It's all one pool of assets used in the commission of crime(s). The accounts are just a ledger sheet of people the criminal owes money to. It isn't the police's job to pay back criminals' debts.

In your example I think there needs to be others on the exchange with orders to sell (that add up to the same amount you want to buy) @ 2765 of your order is to be filled
