Irrationality at play. I just can't tell whose being the irrational one - us or them?

Kraken is a nightmarish piece of shit website. YOU WILL NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE THERE.  I recently had a 30+ email thread with one of their cus-serv guys with no solution. Had to take the frictional costs and move to another exchange. Not only do I not recommend going there, but don't waste a fucking single second of your time, because you'll be going back and forth FOR WEEKS with no resolution.

My "bank account is under review." God only knows why. I gave them every piece of identification documentation a girl could ever dream of. The next thing they'll want is my first born child.  
Everyone LOVES to talk about how BTC is free of government meddling, but I'm sure the long lag time is due to heavy compliance compliance.  I'm personally fine with compliance, just hurry your ass up coinbase. 
I too am thinking about moving to Gemini.

Sir, you are a comedic genius.

Japan is a country of conservative savers, not speculators. Almost over night they would all have to consider BTC a store of value more safe then their banks.  Trust is not developed that quickly.

Coinbase is an absolute shit-show, just like Kraken. Trying Gemini now. They actually have actionable wiring instructions. Never doubt the Winklevii.
