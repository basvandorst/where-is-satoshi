No because it's a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:50:26
Price does not make the technology behind it superior. Inferior products have won before and will win again. First movers advantage is a real leg up on the competition.

This guy gets it

Ding ding ding, and what's the new standard?
We've come full circle.

Incoming Bitcoin Gone Wild?
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:34:19
You bring up some very good points, and after reading it I actually almost went and bought some BTC, but ultimately you have to withdrawal it to use it. At that point you're subject to capital gains tax, inflation tax, and processing fees from the network each time you move it from wallet to wallet (I'm assuming you're keeping it in cold storage). The government is going to get their cut of your earnings no matter what, and so is the Bitcoin Network.
If the end goal is to have a usable currency to fully disengage from the current currencies of the world, which at this point in time it can't do, making all of your points null and void. It's worth a lot, but it's still worthless if it can't be used. This is why I believe it's over valued. We're at a weird transition where the average person isn't going to convert their current currency to a new one, because they can't use it.
By the way, it is more than possible to siege digital assests. Look at Silk Road. Look up laws regusrding seizing of hardware. If they have reason to, they can confiscate your Ledger Nano. It's not immune to being taken from you. 
One point I don't understand is third party censorship, and would actually like to hear more about it.
Also, to answer your tweet, you even said in your post it's painless to use means we already have in place to pay for coffee, so why does he say otherwise?

I got in around 10.5 back in... November? We dipped to 9k.
Anyone that got in since October went into the red.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:18:55
You're right, they will put it somewhere solid and dependable, and that's not going to be an emerging market with high fees to use your own money or a store of value that fluctuates so wildly. 
The fact of the matter is that banks don't charge you to move your money around from wallet to wallet. Go to your bank right now and move money from your checking to your savings account. How much did they charge you to do that? Now look at how much the transaction rate is to move any amount of coins to any address, whether it's to purchase an item or to cold storage. It's currently $40 for it to be instantaneous, and even that can fluctuate. I hate to break it to you, but banks have already solved the problems BTC set out to do besides being a decentralized currency. Whose going to use a decentralized currency if it charges them $40 to buy a coffee, though? Go next door and convince your neighbor or a co-worker to buy BTC right now using those facts. *You can't*. 
However there are decentralized currencies that do solve those problems. It's those shitcoins you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:31:50
It was both.

What do you mean the CEO of Coinbase was comprised?
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:44:44
All of them
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:58:48
Soooooo still high as fuck.
Got it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:41:32
Where are you getting .047% from? The headline clearly states .18%
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:21:09
It's targeted advertising. You're in a subreddit related to cryptocurrencies. What do you expect, ads for poodle grooming in a city near you?
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:10:16
Past trends are not guaranteed to continue. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:11:25
FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SOME REASON.
I bet my friend $100 in any coin of choice that BTC won't hit $20k again by January. It's a currency that can't be used and fluctuates wildly. Why would you buy that? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:51:25
You don't seem to grasp this was said to be *six months away two years ago by a lightning network dev*. You don't promise what you can't deliver.
This is why people are upset. No one is demanding shit but what they were told they were getting by buying the currency.
You're wrong and hostile. What a wonderful combination.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:54:58
How is it free when you're buying the coins to use it?
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:32:32
With Pay-Per-View fees higher than ever.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:20:11
It's the lowest price that the coin has seen in a decent time frame. It may touch that "line" a couple times but it never drops below it, but once it does people panic.

1. He said I could transfer from any account to any account, so that qualifies.
2. How is that any different from bitcoin in it's current state? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:59:13
You can keep downvoting me, dude, but this coin won't be king by the end of this year.
Take your head out of your ass and look at the overall state of this coin. High fees, slow transaction times, and no roadmap or estimation of when it's going to be better. (Jk, they said it would be better 1 and 1/2 years ago.) "Soon" isn't going to keep people around much longer when their are coins that are faster with little to no fees and a functioning product *now*. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:43:35
In the sewer where it belongs
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:26:17
When the devs post on twitter that it's six months away two years ago, yes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:30:26
You mean $50k?
Sorry if I don't get your math, but assuming the price is $10k today won't they profit $10k per coin?
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:34:32
Read his AMA and you won't think he's that bright anymore. He got lucky on one investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:18:05
I think you missed the part where the devs tweeted that it would be ready in 6 months 2 years ago.
I didn't demand shit, they made a promise. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:20:21
A currency you can't use... how innovative.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:00:21
Ethereum, Bcash, and USDT for the currencies, and any market that accepts them.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:17:21
This is almost completely unrelated to what I asked. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:20:21
"There's no better coin other than Bitcoin" is not a solid argument that presents facts. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:10:12
If this didn't make sense to you then you either don't understand networking or can't read. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:04:14
This sounds like you were fine with the system in place *until* you go into crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:47:06
Speaking of efficiency, I don't think $28+ on average to spend $5 is very efficient.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:47:37
Now the technology behind the coin isn't factored in to its value?
Thanks, I think this comment just ended the thread. That's exactly what I was looking for. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:47:14
That's cool. I can trade silver for gold, but the dollar is still used to equate the value of both. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:22:24
You mean like how literally everything else including alts are measured in fiat?
When you ask for a price in a store, the clerk doesn't respond ".00034566 Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:28:48
I just moved money from my checking account to my savings account and it was instant and had no fees.
Also, banks are closed, but that didn't stop me from doing it. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:17:31
Guess you fucked the year up, then. We're not in 2017 anymore Toto.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:09:36
I'm going to get downvoted, but don't start with Bitcoin unless you're just looking for a place to store your fiat. The fees and transfer times are fucking rediculous right now.
Get some LTC or ETH if you are interested in trading.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:24:37
Ethereum brings a lot more to the table than being backed by money. That's a very narrow minded agenda driven comment.
I understand this is the BTC sub, but if BTC is the "king of cryptos" then you don't need to bash others for it to succeed.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:39:19
How do you go from potentially banning cyptocurrencies to this?
All Korean news outside of definitive stances like it finally being banned or bills passing should be banned from the sub IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:13:07
You must be new here.
The top posts are all price memes and you're looking for maturity?
