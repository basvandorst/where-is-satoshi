Yeah they're dumb, but no they shouldn't just "face it". He's a crook and he needs to be found and throw in jail (and all his assets stripped and returned to those he defrauded)
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:20:22
I have nothing invested in it either way (I probably have like 0.00000000275 USD in Bitfloor lol), but he doesn't seem particularly suspicious to me, who knows though?
@_date: 2012-09-05 20:21:31
I have to say I think bitcoin is getting fairly visible at this point...Chuck Schumer talked about it a year ago (in fairly strong language too), and once one politician mentions it, it likely spread all over Congress. At the very least, Congress has heard of it in an offhand fashion. It's certainly not going to get LESS visible.

It's quite simple: only use bitcoins for purchases you need NOW and don't store bitcoins anywhere for any reason...use them and get out of there. I probably had pennies left in USD on bitfloor but I deposit my cash, moved it to a few other wallets, SR, then bought shit. Don't keep bitcoins, guys, it's just not safe. 
@_date: 2012-09-15 16:29:26
I did get a chance to use it yesterday, btw: worked quite well, and for me was just as fast as BitFloor was (he answered my email within 10 minutes, which I found impressive) I just don't plan to keep any funds in there...bitcoin or otherwise. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:57:08
Incompetent, but honest, I agree
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:40:19
Really? You think investing in black market currency is a good idea? Use bitcoins for whatever you need to buy and get rid of them quickly. That's all that bitcoins are useful for, probably as long as they exist. As long as they're associated with the black market, they'll never be a good investment, unless you enjoy a shit-ton of risk. 
@_date: 2012-09-15 16:32:58
Yeah I think he simply uses Dwolla, so that's about right for the timeframe: I'll probably just use Dwolla exclusively when I've met their "30 day transaction history" nonsense for sending to bitcoin sites. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:33:33
And then post many responses to the community explaining the situation and apologizing? Why not just flee the scene completely? It's not like anyone who lost bitcoins has any recourse...if they report it then they're opening their own activities up for inspection. Story seems legit to me. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:46:38
My god...you're serious aren't you? May a god (if he/she/they exist(s)) have mercy on your poor soul. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 16:51:50
bitcointalk...where shit gets done
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:18:51
The problem at the moment, of course, has nothing to do with the currency, which you're right is quite well-implemented. It's the institutions that convert it from another currency that have been giving us problems...they're often as shady as a black market vendor (to stereotype things)
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:59:23
Nobody went to jail: 'nuff said.
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:55:40
Their financials from the last few years would disagree with you, fellow redditor
@_date: 2012-09-13 16:52:54
But is anyone actually going to call the police? I think this is where the supposed anonymity of bitcoins bites us in the ass. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:04:50
Yeah, even when I've had no problems with bitcoins those moments when money is between wallets (or on wallets that aren't particularly secure) I'm usually thinking "well, there goes my money...into nowhere". It's scary not really having any idea if your hard-earned money will still be yours when the whole thing is over. 
@_date: 2012-09-07 05:30:07
Please tell me (either here or in a PM) where I can get info on wallet encryption. I'm a total noob on this and it sounds like a fantastic idea. Also, is it possible to encrypt the address one is sending bitcoins too? This bothers me the most about bitcoins so far...I don't like that people can track where money is going, even if they only have a bunch of seemingly random numbers and letters to show for it. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:35:56
Either way it's not good for him: he either is terrible at securing his website or a thief. I'm not sure which one is worse. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:02:08
Doesn't matter how good he is...hackers can bring down credit card and bank websites, what makes you think his site was somehow more secure than those sites, which also have the backing of the government (in the U.S. at least). There's no protection with bitcoins, we're deluding ourselves if we think so. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 19:45:08
And it should, I don't like what they did on the forums, and that thread should be nuked too. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:29:45
This needs to be made into a poster :-P
@_date: 2012-09-13 16:54:20
Well we're just linking...no information is contained on this website on him. He defrauded people of thousands of bitcoins: I have a low amount of sympathy for him, even if those people were idiots to buy into a clear ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2012-09-13 19:51:59
They do that with money in your checking account too...danger!!!!
@_date: 2012-09-15 16:30:34
I just brought the 99 cents with the rest of my cash: the teller said nothing about it and was very friendly, it was almost too easy :-P
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:48:23
(Deposits all karma on all accounts) You seem very friendly and charismatic...YOU MUST BE TRUSTWORTHY! Herp da derp
@_date: 2012-09-13 19:24:35
Haha very true...this is my go-to subreddit for the best drama :-P well that and @_date: 2012-09-05 20:25:13
If we can get a grip on server security...
@_date: 2012-09-15 16:31:43
Yeah it was pretty much instantaneous, but you just have to be careful to copy down the voucher code: I think if you close the window it displays on its gone forever (bit goofy, imo, it should be emailed to you). It felt longer trading on Mt Gox than getting the coupon, lol. 
@_date: 2012-09-07 05:11:26
I didn't say it was worthless, just unstable: it's value has changed by 20-30% in the last few months. Except by Zimbabwe's standards, that's a lot for a regular currency. Of course, bitcoins aren't normal, and haven't been legitimized yet (and that might not even be a good thing, since it would lead to heavier regulation)
@_date: 2012-09-13 16:49:30
So where now then? I'm surprised how hard it is to find a place I can simply deposit money into a bank account (preferably Chase...the other major banks are a county away) and have it show up within the hour on Mt. Gox. With bitfloor gone I can't seem to find anywhere that still does this: very frustrating. 
@_date: 2012-09-14 03:40:41
Well that's good to hear. I'll really miss BitFloor, it was the most effortless method I've used yet to get bitcoins. With any luck, maybe this site will become a much more secure version of BitFloor: the owner has indicated on the bitcoin forums that most of his funds are in cold wallets. How cold we dont know...but at least it's better than BitFloor storing EVERYTHING in hot wallets (/fail)
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:03:34
Why even that? Bitcoin is a terribly unstable currency: keeping it under lock and key won't be any good if the market collapses and your formerly 2000 dollars worth of bitcoins is now worth 500 bucks. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 16:06:15
Money was taken out of bitfloor...there's your evidence. You always start with the owners as thieves because they have easiest access. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 20:24:40
Very curious...it's very small amounts (0.001 BTC up to 0.01 BTC) but it's being deposited every 20 or so seconds. Very interested in seeing what happens here. 
edit: reading more comments, I became aware that they're binary transactions (or at least appear to be)...so there should be some sort of message hopefully
@_date: 2012-09-14 03:42:19
Ah I didn't think about that, plus I just got an order that ends with 99 cents, which is kinda awkward to be depositing in a drive-thru bank. 
Edit: It does look like, however, you can make an AurumXchange voucher instead of trading on Bitme, and then you can just use AurumXchange to send the voucher to Mt Gox to exchange for bitcoins. I kinda prefer that, too, since there's a lot of steps involved (read: harder to track)
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:00:16
No doubt if/when the government investigates this, we'll find evidence, for whoever did the stealing. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 15:58:00
Except he has a presence on the forums...and still does even after this happened. What kind of thief tries to keep people up to date with the situation? He could have just walked away and there's nothing anyone could do about it.
