Pisses me off when people talk about investing in Bitcoin, as if it's some thing to just make a quick buck not realizing the value comes in treating it like an actual currency
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:47:40
I'm in it for decentralized currency but most noobs are in it because they want a place to dump their money in hopes of becoming rich without doing any work or research
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:46:53
If it stabilized I would much rather prefer crypto
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:39:32
They've been fucking over the 4th amendment for years now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:16
That's what everyone said when it first hit $1000
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:36
Last I heard it crashed most likely due to the overload atm.  
  
Should be up and running soon

We've been waiting at @_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:51
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:05
Implying we've ever had anything like Bitcoin in the past
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:48:04
Jesus I still remeber that crash. The worst was when it stagnated around $400 
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:52:25
I can't help but love a good conspiracy.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:24:30


  
Exactly. That's what most of us credit to the huge success of dogecoin. Most of us are bitcoiners trying to have fun with a cryptocurrency. No pressure for it to succeed or anything serious of the sort. We just have fun with it, in a way we can't with our bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:00:14
Yeah exactly. Everyone needs to keep in mind that they are a company, and exist to make money. If they don't have the capital to afford taking a risk by accepting bitcoin, they obviously won't.
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:06:26
Those discussions happen every day. They're happening on @_date: 2014-05-27 03:58:17
Thinkgeek is about as geeky as the big bang theory
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:28:58
We at would pay the fighter to say "wow" with each hit he lands.
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:26:35
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:53:29
You probably have the wrong woman them.
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:22:51
It's cool to find places accepting bitcoin, but don't rely on the reviews.
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:11:01
Go to for a real analysis 
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:59:11
That what I honestly think every merchant who accepts it thinks. They're taking a risk because they hope for it to appreciate in value.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:18:23
When it stablizes. People see it as an investment when they should see it as a  decentralized currency
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:11:31
I've been buying them and explaining them to people who are mature enough to not immediately jump to thinking it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:07:18
Now I just gotta wait to be tipped for something.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:36:24
But the thing is Im afraid this current price rise is a bubble and soon the prices will drop
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:36:23
My first tip! Thank you sir or mam!
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:13:16
Him. That actually makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:32:07
And your third soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:44:35
Are you talking about investing on smaller amounts of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:01:24
That was the most unbiased media coverage of bitcoin I've seen so far.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:08:56
Me too. Just gotta wait till it hits $1,000,000 and then I can buy a bunch of teslas.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:14:21
Making sure I get a rain check on the thanksgiving sales price? That kind of customer service will probably make me come back many times
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:24:33
Exactly. This is probably the worst time to liquidate as the price has already started rising again.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:35:07
Do you accept payment in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:02:57
Same. I don't have much yet but little by little I'm getting there.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:39:11
What is it? A sub that describes who accepts bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:02:00
Yeah I followed that logic *once*. When bitcoin went from $200 to $400 I thought there'd be a crash and waited for that before investing. Needles to say I dont follow that logic much anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:35:18
The majority of adults using it have very little understanding of how it works.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:34:15
I see it as the same as paying a neighborhood kid to now my lawn. Just in this instance the form of currency has changed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:30:37
Have you ever contested the priest, saying that those things can be bought with the us dollar yet he wouldn't advise against that?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:24:03
Dude I waitwd for the pop down when it jumped to $400, and look where it is now
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:39:21
At this point I want a mix. I want to have some that I hold long term but I want to also have some that I can short term sell to make profit in hopes of further adding to my long term investment.
