Does that "before anything else" include running tournaments, accepting deposits, having a web site back on, having a FAQ with absolutely no hint of the giant clusterfuck or what old members can do about it, and probably dozens of other things BTContilt has been doing?    
Because it sure as hell looks to me like the owners ran away with the money, waited a few months, and are now trying to repeat the scam.

I remember commenting in about how this anonymous, unregulated, play-money software site was a bad idea, and I got all the downvotes in the world for not being a trusting cretin. I find it hilarious that you're now saying you should have tried to figure out who was running everything... No shit, Sherlock.

FTFY. Anyone who trusted a completely anonymous site with no third party certifications, with uncertified software designed for play money, with no dispute resolution policy and in fact no security policy at all, deserves exactly what they got.    
I'd say this situation has little to do with bitcoins except for the fact that they facilitate exactly this kind of scammy business. Oh, bitcoins are completely anonymous, so the site can be anonymous as well... Well, sorry, I'm not going to deal with an anonymous site with no commitment to security and do it with untraceable, anonymous currency. That's just a recipe for disaster.

You put your anonymous, untraceable, unregulated money on a site with anonymous operators, no security policy, no dispute resolution policy, no third-party certifications, no certified software, then you gotta deal with the inevitable situation where you get scammed by that site.   
You should have seen it coming, but I guess all you US players are so desperate to play poker online that you're willing to ignore all of that. Oh well.

I wish a random 200 pound salmon falls from the sky right onto your face.
