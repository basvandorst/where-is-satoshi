You are really reaching for the extreme applications when it comes to marginal utility, diminishing returns and time value of money when it comes to current consumption versus savings. I think individual choices will be more incremental and not as prone to the extremes.
For example, in Oct 2011 I canceled my $85/month cell phone contract and began using the Talkatone app over Wifi for free and H20 wireless prepaid cards while out and about. The difference in user experience was very small. I calculated the amount I spent at particular times on telecommunications since then in both USD and BTC. The BTC at current rates is a difference of about $75,000 from cutting consumption and shifting the capital to savings in BTC instead of USD.
People's consumption choices might begin to change if they have a reliable savings vehicle that is, on average, appreciating in value. Imagine cutting the $150/month cable bill for 18 months and then being able to buy a Lamborghini. Or just sit on the BTC for another 2-3 years and then being able to buy the multi-million dollar mansion, condo, airplane, yacht, etc. or slowly trickle out the BTC to fund a more moderate lifestyle and get one's time freedom.

This is great advice.
I do not necessarily agree with the fixed number of addresses but the scope of attack vectors and possibility of profit should be greatly reduced.
For exchanges, etc. this could be done by (1) specifying a public key address for administrative access to an account and (2) require a signed message from the administrative public key whenever material details are to be changed such as password, withdrawal address, password reset (coinbr.com already implements this type of a scheme), etc.
Then the private key to the administrative public key could be kept safe in something like Armory (
This type of a setup would greatly reduce the attack vectors on an account and even if an account were compromised then it would greatly reduce the possibility that the compromiser could profit from the compromise.
Additionally, 2FA is already known to be completely insecure with the NSA collecting hundreds of millions of text messages on a regular basis.

Great segment Matt. Seems like you honed in on the important issue that one can hold the private keys to their own bitcoins and not have to trust anyone. This does require a lot more personal responsibility but is a great power considering almost any other type of asset class has the 'private keys' held by some other trusted third party.

A central theorem of cryptography is that anything that can be done with a central authority can be done without one.
Thank goodness these technological advancements in cryptography have made obsolete the main functions of the social contract between individuals and governments with regards to communications (mail), medium of exchange (legal tender) and property rights (property, contract and remedy law) by creatively destroying communications (PGP and Maid Safe) to money and payments (Bitcoin) and soon to contracts and remedies (Ethereum).

The root seed concept in Armory was the precursor for HD wallets. In a few months the next version of Armory wallets will have full HD support. One example of superiority would be with how change is handled.
That is good you feel comfortable with the Coinbase multisig vault.
Just so others who may read this thread understand, Armory Lockboxes are far superior to Coinbase multisig vaults. A major problem with Coinbase's multisig vaults is the private keys could be compromised and it would be impossible to determine where the security breach occurred; Coinbase or user. Consequently, chain of custody on the private keys is fuzzy.
Their implementation, along with vulnerabilities, was thoroughly discussed in the Google Group. Unfortunately, Coinbase has not changed the inaccurate and misleading information on the description page to fully describe the potential vulnerabilities. Consequently, some people may have an inaccurate understanding of how secure the private keys are with Coinbase's multisig vault product.

Nice catch MillyBitcoin.
This may be an issue of Google crafting the site description which would mean it could not be changed by the maintainers. It most likely appears because the page source lacks the meta name description and content.
I went in to find the specific code to get this fixed but it seems like the description, used for SEO purposes, was neither where one would expect it to be nor in the page source when the site is loaded. It appears to be absent.
The fix should be to add the meta name to the index.html file and then add the description to the various translation files. **The description should be at most 156 characters.**
index.html - line 14 (points to)
/_translations/en.yml - content missing needs &lt;meta name="description" content="ADD CONTENT HERE" /&gt;
As a side note, the **Title can be 70 characters** and is currently: Bitcoin - Open source P2P money
I think this would be more descriptive and better than the current title: Bitcoin - A peer to peer payment network and global ledger

Bitcoin is a new form of society creating property rights using software code not legal code and is the first practical implementation of triple-entry bookkeeping.
If Wikileaks, TOR and I2P enforce the First Amendment and things like KeepassX and TrueCrypt enforce the Fourth Amendment then Bitcoin enforces the Fifth Amendment (cannot be denied property without due process of law and just compensation).
I think a better way of phrasing this is that with Bitcoin (crypto-property) you can hold the private keys of wealth but with any other form of property (bank accounts, real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.) a trusted third party, usually ending up with government, ultimately holds those private keys.
When you securely hold the private keys, like with Armory ( then it can make it practically impossible to seize, freeze, confiscate or otherwise take that crypto-property. It rends things like eminent domain impotent.

Will be interesting to see what effect this will have on ZNGA's stock price. It could be material!
VIDEO OF ZNGA BITCOIN TRANSACTION
Notice the transaction is for $5 and how fast it went with no personal information.
The credit card or Paypal fee would be $0.30+2.9% or $0.445 or 8.9%. Reddit's CEO, which sells a $4.99 digital good, said after 3 months the Bitcoin percentage was up to 2.5% of gross sales but because of lower transaction fees Bitcoin payments accounted for 3.4% of net of transaction fee income. In 2012 Zynga did $1.2B of gross revenue.
So Zynga they transition over 2.5% of gross sales like Reddit did then that would be $30m/year and a savings of about $222,500/month in transaction fees. Not bad for a few hours of their developer's time implementing Bitpay.

There is really a lot more to this argument than just raving lunacy. Consequently, I am not sure if you have thoroughly thought out your position particularly when you state 'not have to deal with a bank [trusted third party]. There is really no way in the current political reality to separate property rights from politics.
One of the most accepted functions of government is to hold the private keys (ultimate dominion or control versus ownership) of property like with real estate land registry, corporations, chain of title, seizure, eminent domain, etc. As a result, no great amount of wealth has been created and sustained without the permission of the government. Additionally, third parties like banks, courts, etc. are necessary for the holding and administration of the private keys.
Bitcoin is the first example of sovereign crypto-property where individuals hold the private keys and the network automates the administration of the private keys. Additional innovations in the crypto-property framework, like Ethereum or Maid Safe, will only continue to disrupt the 'property rights market' and work to wrest control of capital away from the governmental scheme of property rights into the cryptographic scheme of property rights because the costs of protection and administration are so much lower.
Additionally, another way to look at currencies is as the common stock of their issuers. So the USD would be like the common stock of the USG while the YEN would be like the common stock of Japan and Bitcoin would be the common stock of crypto-nation Cipherspace (a crypto-anarchy situation where violence is rendered impotent through the use of mathematics and computing). The natural path of Cipherspace is to decentralize everything (asymmetric cryptography, PGP, Bitcoin, Maid Safe, etc.) because a central theorem of cryptography is that anything that can be done with a trusted party can be done without one.
Consequently, a very generalized statement would be: Statists are in favor of only governments (a centralized 'trusted' third party) holding the private keys of wealth whereas libertarians are in favor of individuals holding the private keys of wealth.

Seriously, after this legitimate scare you are going to continue dinking around with *only* using BIP 38? Please stop being a noob.
This is a prime example of why you should be using Armory (
You could create cold storage multi-signature lockboxes using public keys from multiple wallets. These lockboxes could be anywhere from 1-1 to 7-7. 2-3 should be sufficient for most use cases.
The wallets could have the seed, from which all of the private keys can be reconstituted, could be split up using Fragment Backups (Shamir's). 8-12 is the max; using 3-5 should be sufficient.
Then you could have the component parts adequately distributed so even if one (the safe - containing multiple but not fully sufficient parts of each component wallet) or more were to be compromised it would not compromise the private keys.

I think you are completely wrong. Human sacrifice is practiced on a massive scale.
For example, the State is largely in monopoly control of the roads and solely because of prevailing bad ideas just like what happened in those 'few primitive societies' you mention. Dr. Block has already explained in his book 'The Privatization of Roads and Highways' how because of the economic incentives in place because of that there are approximately 40,000 more deaths every year than if all the roads were privatized. Most people would be outraged if the airline industry sacrificed 40,000 people per year but when it comes to roads and car accidents most people just shrug and never think about it.
And even worse is that at least in the more primitive societies like the Incan where they practiced human sacrifice to feed the sun so it would not burn out the logic was more sound than the logic used to justify governmental monopoly over roads.

The problem I see is that from time frame X to Y, for example about 30 minutes, a query of the blockchain can result in N addresses having total outputs of about Z amounts and P addresses have total inputs of about Z amounts. The iterations does not do much to obscure that type of data mining of the blockchain. Make sense or am I missing something?
However, if there are multiple outputs and the outputs are at least 25/75 split of the total inputs then the query can no longer be run with statistical confidence that the final outputs of any two particular addresses being related.

You are most likely conflating the disinformation or misinformation with the assertions. It is possible to either disinform or misinform while at the same time not asserting.
To illustrate, we will take two statements which we will assume for the sake of argument are equally true.
(1) S pointed the gun at A and pulled the trigger causing the bullet to exit the gun and eviscerate A's heart resulting in A's death.
(2) C, who everyone thinks hated A, entered the room, then one bullet exited a gun and A died.
If you fail to see the difference between the facts asserted in 1 and 2 and how those facts could be used when it comes to making assertions when questioned about things you would prefer not to discuss then perhaps you should take a logic class or two.
Sure, whether C hated A could be misinformation or disinformation and be an opinion not fact and the mentally and logically lazy could assume that C killed A by firing the gun but it would be a logical fallacy resulting from the assumption of unknown facts and a conclusion based on incomplete knowledge although it could appear reasonable if the unknown facts were true.

Having something in writing would just be helpful evidence to firmly establish the bank is not involved in the cryptographic services market as applied with Bitcoin so there are no bank trade secrets and no legitimate business interest for the bank to protect.
You may want to peruse the Wikipedia article ( on enforceability of non-competes. It sounds like the bank is not involved in nor interested in entering the cryptographic services industry and so I am not sure why you would think doing something in Bitcoin would be doing something that would be in competition with the bank. There is no 'trade secret' to protect for the bank and likely no legitimate business interest. And even if it were interpreted so broadly for either of those then it would still likely be too restrictive on your ability to make a living.

Many people or institutions have multiple levels of security.
1.) Deep cold storage (Armory + multi-sig + fragmented backups)
2.) Cold storage (Armory or multi-sig with cold+warm storage)
3.) Warm storage (Armory online)
4.) Hot storage (Blockchain.info mobile app, etc.)
Not really sure why it is so difficult for people to use multiple wallets like this to trade off convenience and security. With Armory it only takes about 45 seconds to sign a offline transaction so level two (holding $30,000 worth in a multi-sig cold/warm storage scenario) is not that burdensome and would require two devices being compromised; one of them being completely cold which would be very difficult.
Level one would be sufficient security for people or institutions to be securing tens of millions of dollars worth.

If you do not solely hold the private keys in deep cold storage, like with Armory, then you do not truly hold bitcoins.

And on his CNN appearance ( he specifically called out Amazon and said the major retailers will have to accept Bitcoin because otherwise they will be giving up this market segment without a fight and he doubts they will do that. Considering Bitcoin's first 24 hours of sales at Overstock accounting for about 4.5% of annualized revenue, far greater than the 2.7% based on Reddit's numbers, I think any retail CEO worth his salary has to be seriously considering Bitcoin now.

We all get dealt different cards and have a unique hand to play so all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
One of my greatest inspirations is one of my uncles. He was a poor uneducated dairy farmer when, around age 22, he was sitting under a haystack and an 80+ pound hay bale fell from the top and broke his neck. He has been a quadriplegic for over 20 years and confined to a wheelchair and has minimal movement of his limbs; even his fingers are paralyzed.
Fortunately, he received some great medical care and after the accident and when he had done the hard work to get himself in a somewhat stable condition he chose to enroll in college for the first time. He graduated in five years. I remember visiting once for a family dinner and he was typing out his paper for class, letter by letter, with a stick he held with his teeth.
After receiving his degree he started a new career and has added tremendous value to society in many different ways. One professional assignment he had was to fly around the world and speak about disabilities with Christopher Reeve (actor who played Superman and was later paralyzed like my uncle).
One of the reasons my uncle is such a great inspiration to me is that sometimes life does not give you just lemons but you can get dealt a really really crappy hand and even though that happened to him instead of whining, complaining and moaning about his horrible circumstances he has and wasting his life being a burden on other he has, with the sheer force and power of his will, carved out a life that has been of tremendous value and inspirational lift to others.

Most people condemn the Incas for their bad ideas related to human sacrifice for various reasons like to get more sun and rain but never think twice about bad ideas being implemented through government policy in the modern age.
For example, just think of the public outcry if 60,000 people a year died on the airlines but with about that many dieing on the roads most people are completely oblivious. This monopoly in roads with government bureaucrats who make decisions on how these resources are allocated are never held to account for either malicious disregard for human life or gross negligence nor can competing firms serve market needs. If the public assets of roads were privatized then we could have different services spring up like a Yelp! or a safety rating service. For example, would you be willing to pay more to drive on a road where there is a lower fatality rating? But currently there is no way to do that because they are socialized.
In The Privatization of Roads and Highways ( Dr. Block estimates that at least 30,000-40,000 less people would die every year if the road resources were privatized. Thus, there exists a modern form of human sacrifice based on bad ideas just like the Incas.

The trade off of convenience is with security.
With BIP 38 the private key is still reconstituted at a single point and time. That opens up an attack surface and major attack vector. Plus, you have address reuse issues.
An Armory backup is not much more work and gives a lot more benefit since the seed lets you reconstitute the entire wallet and helps protect against address reuse.
And multi-sig lets you have multiple wallets all running on independent machines with their own security profiles.
As for a 'non-computer genius wife' .... I think you are likely underestimating her ability to learn some basic cryptography and how to recover the funds. Additionally, I have found women very open to learning how to hold their own private keys to become more empowered plus it only takes a few hours.

The claim is completely sensationalistic and not grounded in any solid legal theory. However, there is some history and legal basis he is probably confused about.
The US Constitution provides under Article 1 Section Clause 5 Congress has the power to 'Coin money and regulate the value thereof' and under Article 1 Section 10 Clause 1 'No state shall ... coin money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts'.
This provided that the States determined what was legal tender (court judgments could be issued in it) but they were restricted to making only gold or silver coin thus they cannot make apples, oranges or even Federal Reserve Notes legal tender. Under the 10th Amendment and because there is no express power granted to the Federal government in Article 1 Section 8 therefore they cannot make anything legal tender. Thus, 31 USC 5101-5118 are unconstitutional but will never be addressed by the USSC because they are political questions.
However, under Article 1 Section 8 Clause 5 the Federal government can 'coin money' which means the actual physical minting and can define terms like 'dollar'. The term dollar was used in the Constitution but never defined. Both Jefferson and Hamilton found this ambiguity troublesome and so the 1792 Coinage Act was passed. Section 9 defined the term 'Dollar' and Section 19 of the Coinage Act provided:
'SEC. 19. And be it further enacted, That if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value than the same ought to be pursuant to the directions of this act, through the default or with the connivance of any of the officers or persons who shall be employed at the said mint, for the purpose of profit or gain, or otherwise with a fraudulent intent, and if any of the said officers or persons shall embezzle any of the metals which shall at any time be committed to their charge for the purpose of being coined, or any of the coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint, every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death.'
Consequently, it is behavior like money printing, QE and currency debasement that the 1792 Coinage Act provided the death penalty for but only for governmental officers and not private citizens.

Well, for whatever reason the transaction likely got flagged as suspicious. It may be the beneficiary of the wire that caused this and have nothing to do with you. If the transaction got flagged as suspicious then it required manual investigation to determine whether a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) should be filed. The root of all this is the AML legislation.
If you understand why he is calling and asking questions then you can get a better handle on how to respond to his questions. And the more incredulous and believable your response the better. Overall, I think you did well but this might have been a better response.
* BM: 'What was this transaction for?'
* You: 'A computer.'
* BM: 'That is a lot of money for a computer. What kind and what does it do?'
* You: 'Well, in light of the recent compromises of credit cards with Target our business has decided to allocate more capital towards computer security. This computer is cutting edge with extremely fast processors and while we do not necessarily absolutely need it nevertheless it may help us increase out computer security and, hopefully, keep our customers safe from any type of security breaches and so we would rather be safe than sorry since even Target has shown their vulnerability.'
* BM: 'Oh, that's awesome. Keep up the good work!'
And, of course, when all else fails or you just want to be obstinate then you can fall back on these two great questions my criminal law professor gave me. **(1)** 'That is interesting, why do you ask?'

Yes. The problem is on OP's side. He should have specified a certain amount of USD to receive for the invoice. Then Bitpay would have served the amount of bitcoins that should have been sent based on current exchange rates and guaranteed for 15 minutes. If OP's business partner did not agree with that exchange rate within the 15 minute time period then he could have refused to send the bitcoins.
While not directly related to OP's complaint nevertheless OP should keep in mind that Bitpay is *not* an exchange. And it should also go without saying that engaging in self-dealing through Bitpay is a breach of the ToS. For example, if OP's business partner were fictitious and OP were really using Bitpay as an exchange.

This gets at a larger issue shareholders should be cautious of which is: Tim Cook being in the shadow of Steve Jobs.
The whole brand, culture and ideological mission behind Apple was Steve's drive to 'make a dent in the universe' to bring to pass his vision and mission of bringing computing and innovation to the individual so the individual could express themselves uniquely and innovate. And it was this passion and mission that Steve tapped into people's hearts that provided for the large profit margins, incredible brand loyalty and devotion of 'Apple fanbois'.
By removing the last remaining Bitcoin wallet Apple is taking a clear stance against innovation and that is antithetical to the vision and mission of Steve Jobs. Consequently, it is no surprise that the very passion that was beneficial for Apple has now been turned against it.

Coinbase is the weak link that breaks the loop. You should not be using it for any time sensitive Bitcoin payments. Once I wanted to test how long it takes. I sent a transaction from Coinbase and then one from my Blockchain.info wallet. The Blockchain.info transaction had 62 confirmations before the Coinbase transaction got broadcast.
Entire new tools and code has to be built for both the Bitcoin protocol and Bitpay's services to handle refunds that are caused as a result of Coinbase (or any other wallet) not broadcasting in a timely manner. It will get built out eventually but until then the Bitcoin community is stuck with Coinbase's turd in the punch bowl.
Indeed, in March Coinbase really screwed stuff up and Bitpay took financial loss when they did not need to in order to help out both merchants and customers.
So, I would not really be upset with Bitpay or Gyft but instead with Coinbase. And then you should just realize that is how their system works and to not rely on them for time sensitive transactions.
What is pretty unbelievable from a customer service standpoint is that Coinbase does not inform or warn customers that transactions are not immediately broadcast and may be delayed.

There are tons of legitimate reasons for wanting to 'tumble' or 'wash' them.
For three quick example, (1) to obfuscate the total gross income from competitors since this is already generally considered a trade secret and Foodler already inadvertently disclosed how much Bitcoin revenue they were doing, (2) to obfuscate or eliminate the ability of snoopy people to ascertain net worth or other sensitive financial data like paycheck amounts, etc. in order to reduce one's target for kidnapping or some other nefarious extortion plan just like one does not walk around with their net worth or bank balance plastered to their forehead and (3) to create asymmetric information to increase one's bargaining position such as if they are either a landlord or tenant with regard to income, expenses, etc.

**First**, there are salable and unsalable bitcoins just like there is salable and unsalable gold. **Second**, float plays a huge part. **Third**, funds flow has to be analyzed but to get a good picture of what is actually happening then one would likely need to have data and numbers from major exchange(s) and merchant processor(s). **Fourth**, a BTC/USD carry-trade, currently encouraged by US tax policy with regards to capital gains on BTC and the ability to deduct interest expense, will be the coup de grace in this currency war due to the interest rate structures. **Fifth**, is the equity based full reserve nature of Bitcoin resulting in no counter-party risk in contrast to debt based fiat currency and fractional reserve banking.

The difference between cold storage Armory (a computer that never has and never will be connected to the Internet) and Armory (a computer that is connected to the Internet) is where the level one and two security really gets ramped up in effectiveness. Combining cold storage multi-sig with fragmented backups empowers people to reduce the attack surface to a minuscule size. Then the attack vectors can be protected against with relative ease.
Level one (deep cold storage) would be several cold storage wallets on different offline computers having the seed split using fragmented backups and using those wallets making a multi-sig lockbox. If it was a 2-3 multi-sig lockbox and if you were using 3-5 for fragmented backups on each wallet then there would be a total of 15 pieces of paper and you would need 6 of those at a minimum (and the right six!) to reconstitute the all the private keys needed to move funds in the lockbox. This would provide enough security for most people to feel confident securing tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins.
If you are at work and only have your mobile phone for you wallet then it will be difficult to maintain a good security profile. Nevertheless, the actual risk is not like a 30% probability of compromise per day. Thus, for many people level three or four would be fine for $1,000 of bitcoins. You just have to consider it like your physical wallet; how much are you willing to lose and what do you think the probability of occurrence is?

I do not think the issue is with the online wallet but instead with some type of malware or falling for a phishing site like blockchian.info (before removed by host).
It would be interesting if a script could have been written to gather encrypted wallets based on alias's. If someone could have downloaded thousands of encrypted wallets which they got from blockchain.info by going through lots of alias's then they could start trying to bruteforce those encrypted wallets now.
This might make it important for everyone to switch identifiers and not use private keys stored in the previous encrypted wallets. Pretty annoying but could mitigate the risks caused by the potential compromise if that were the attack vector.
On another note, I had a friend whose address contained in a Blockchain wallet was compromised and he lost a significant amount of bitcoins. He had a 2 character identifier but otherwise had decent security practices and was running OSX. I am not sure if he had paired the device. I doubt it was a phishing site attack vector because the bitcoins were transferred 4 days after his most recent login.

This book is probably the most prescient one I have read on the transition into the Information Age.
The only glaring example where I think the authors were blatantly wrong was that there would be an expansion in citizenship-by-investment programs. Since 2001 there has actually be a reversal in this trend with many programs closing.
However, in the past 1-2 years there has been quite the reversal in this trend with Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Malta, Bulgaria and several other countries passing legislation for CIBs. So, I am not so sure the authors were wrong it is just they were not right yet.
Anyway, this is a great book to read. But the first 2/3rds are a lot better and paradigm shifting than the last 1/3rd.

Was talking to a friend earlier today. Coinbase has duplicates of a transaction and have taken 50BTC from his account. I had my friend send Olaf an email and he got a reply but no follow up and the issue has not been resolved.
Meanwhile, my friend is wondering where his ~$50,000 of bitcoins are that Coinbase has lost in their computer system.
Yes, there is a lot of growth and traffic happening in Bitcoin. But it seems clear that Coinbase is continuing to grow (as CorgiDad has said they are continuing to accept new customers many of whom do not understand Bitcoin) and making a decision to do so at the expense of customer service for current customers.
So meanwhile my friend who has a Computer Science degree from Harvard and has been using Bitcoin since 2011 is being screwed out of his $50,000 of bitcoins, not getting any customer service and not able to make trade decisions with that capital thus being damaged significantly through lost opportunity.
Coinbase really should get their act together and get this situation solved. After all, with fees and the increase of BTC price Coinbase could have upwards of $200m of bitcoin on their balance sheet to spend on customer support staff. There should be no shortage of capital to grow this business.

People who want to buy cheaply might be downvoting?
But your 'fiat' problem is a very real one. Just think of all the people with too much fiat in banks like Cyprus, etc. and having to deal with the QE issue. They want to get rid of the fiat since it is just being printed to oblivion and in the process are trading it for bitcoins. You can bet many of these VCs have more fiat than they know what to do with so they want to buy things the central planners cannot print.
I think a good play might be to get non-recourse debt on NNN commercial property from solid credit risks like Home Depot, Wal-Mart, etc. That way you can leverage lots of fiat and be sitting on bitcoins to multiply the wealth transfer effect without having too much risk due to the non-recourse nature.

I think you are missing my point. As Wayne Gretzky said, "I do not skate where the puck is but where it is going to be."
For current assets everyone has different subjective value and speculation on the future price. The market distills this into the current price. Then the market rewards with profit those who allocate capital well and punishes those with losses who allocate capital poorly. Trace has a fantastic publicly documented record in this cryto-currency niche for making correct calls for capital allocation.
And strategically it makes sense to publicly say there is no revenue model .... because of asymmetrical information it may serve to keep competition at bay and other investors from funding similar startups resulting in more time and a greater head start.
So, we will see if Armory turns out well or not.

Why would the company want to do both of those tasks? They can easily outsource to Bitpay for a mere 0.99% for the processing and the company can choose what % of sales goes to bitcoins and fiat. And I think you may be understating the counter-party risk of the exchange which could either fail or abscond with the funds at anytime. That risk would be greatly increased if the company is trying to run its own bot in contrast to just outsourcing to Bitpay.

Perhaps they wanted to spend bitcoins on stuff or perhaps they had to spend them to survive or whatever reason they have been unable to earn, save and invest in the various speculations mentioned in the article. Sure it is unfortunate but it is just reality.
But to say that those who accurately prognosticated three investments in the past six months that returned an average of 1,400% each merely got lucky like some chimp throwing darts at the dartboard is ludicrous. There is no randomness about it. And each of our balance sheets and bitcoin wallets testifies to our ability to meet preparation with opportunity along with action to profit from it.

The last bubble went from $0.05 to about $32 and unlike so many who are calling this a bubble I know what it felt like back then because I was there. For a comparable move the bitcoin price would need to move from about $5 to around $3,200, a 20x rise from current prices, and we are only about 5% up this ‘wall of worry’.'

Coinbase is the problem not your cold wallet. For example, I was purchasing something and made two identical purchases. I paid one invoice from my Coinbase account and the other immediately after from my Armory wallet. The transaction from the Armory wallet had 62 confirmation before the Coinbase payment was even broadcast to the network. If your transaction broadcasting speed is important then do not rely on Coinbase to broadcast it in a timely manner.
I think there is a way to get the Coinbase transaction data from the JSON and broadcast it yourself but that takes some extra work.

And some may want to pick up a copy of A Lawyer's Take On Bitcoin And Taxes to get a general overview of the landscape before spending $100+/hour on an accountant.
To take the other side of your argument that 'there is not an investor in the world that is not going to tell you to cash out'; I think there are plenty of reasons not to. Additionally, those who have wealth usually have it for a reason and did not 'just get lucky' like you are asserting with your powerball analogy.
The people who have a lot of wealth in BTC have it because they have superior foresight, technical competence and were willing to take an entrepreneurial risk. The rise in price, or profit, is the market's way of saying that their economic calculation was correct. Additionally, BTC's rising price is largely just a wealth transfer that is starting and will most likely be massive (just see the infographic on  for comparisons in size to other assets, currencies, etc. and the general macro picture of this asset class).
Of course, another problem with your premise is that one needs to 'cash out' of BTC.
Why move from an asset that has no storage fees, cannot be confiscated, has no counterparty risk and can be transferred to anyone at anytime and if you are holding it in cold storage, like with Bitcoin Armory ( is completely within your control with no strings, custodians, trustees, etc. attached? Why move wealth away from that asset class and into the USD/EUR/CNY/YEN, etc. which are not limited in amount, currently being QEd to infinity and would be stored in a bank that most likely needed and will need a bailout because insolvency?
And even worse, why pay a capital gains tax to run away from the solution back towards the problem?
Perhaps the correct way to see it, the way the market is currently saying is correct because of the rising price, is that people need to 'cash out' of fiat currencies, bank account, brokerage accounts and other forms of assets that have strings attached, custodians, trustees, etc. until all his financial and political turmoil gets settled.

Are there any plans to have shipping addresses in Oregon or New Hampshire (go Freestaters!)? Neither has sales tax so using your service could actually be significantly cheaper all things considered and still not take much time.

Think how much Redbox could save by using Bitcoin instead of credit cards.

Coinbase screwed up and in this case BitPay is eating the loss instead of causing inconvenience to the merchants and customers mainly out of altruism to the Bitcoin community and economy.
The loss should be eaten by Coinbase, the customers or the merchants. The professional thing to do would be for Coinbase to reimburse BitPay for the financial losses incurred by BitPay as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. And Coinbase should have been on top of this and posted such a resolution to their blog first.
I doubt BitPay or other merchant processors will continue to be willing to incur financial losses and be this patient with incompetent service providers in the future as the Bitcoin economy continues growing.

AKWAnalytics, Bitcoin is a sterile asset and as such any change in price is purely a wealth transfer effect taking place. It empowers people to make the world what they want it to be because the consumer is king and with Bitcoin assets cannot be seized, confiscated or frozen without the owner's consent.
This is a huge contrast to the current financial and economic system where one's financial capital is conscripted into activities one may disagree with such as providing loans to arms companies to build drones and assassinate children, like Tariq Aziz and his 12 year old cousin Waheed Khan, for political speech.
And the size of Bitcoin is minuscule compared to the financial world. Not only is one's wealth likely safer in Bitcoin than in bank accounts, like with Cyprus, but it also makes a definite political statement and attacks the current system at its most vulnerable part. And if only 1% of capital currently in offshore tax haven bank accounts were to move into Bitcoin then it would be around $28,000 per bitcoin.
If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, perhaps of the Internet, and is classed alongside the USD, EUR, YEN, RMB then it those types of figures are feasible.
But I agree that bitcoin is not a get-rich quick scheme. But given how quickly things can go viral on the Internet it could be an extremely fast and massive wealth transfer the likes of which the world has never seen in all of its history. A wealth transfer that will empower people to see the future they want and make it real.

Bitpay processed more than $5m of payments in March and has over 4,500 merchants so they can handle the volume and the exchange rate risk. Plus, they charge only a 0.99% fee which is extremely competitive.
They already have several plugins that will likely integrate with your shopping chart for digital products or you can probably switch carts pretty easily.
I do not think they currently support subscriptions. But they are in the process of hiring more developers and subscriptions are one of the highly requested features so it is probably a matter of just building it. That is another advantage of going with the largest processor is they will have staying power and innovation ability.
Bitpay already has easy tools for creating one-off invoice payments. I have used them and you can create an invoice in under a minute then just email the unique URL to your client.
If you really have questions that these do not answer then I would recommend creating an account, since it is free, and just testing it out and comparing it against the competitors.

@_date: 2013-06-29 02:51:26
lazzyboy5540, This answer should not be considered legal advice.
The wording of these questions is fairly benign although impregnated with a fact not in evidence (that you purchased any bitcoins), can be answered in vague but plausible ways that are neither incriminating nor admitting of any particular facts and most likely helps the bank's Compliance Officer perform their duties under the Bank Secrecy Act. Consequently, it makes sense to not do any sudden moves, like withdraw all your money and close the account, that could raise suspicion and result in greater scrutiny.
For example, the FBAR is due June 30th and there is a $250,000 fine or 10 years in jail per year per account not filed. So if you had a MtGox account in 2012 with a balance greater than $10,000 at anytime or a combined value of all foreign financial accounts greater than $10,000 and have not filed the FBAR then it would be very unwise to do anything that could result in greater scrutiny.
Some plausible answers, that do not actually even admit that you purchased any bitcoins although they do not specifically deny the impregnated question, but are still fairly believable for a Compliance Officer and would most likely not arouse suspicion would be:
1. The price of bitcoins had tripled from early March to early April when I decided I wanted to have funds available to purchase bitcoins as a speculative investment.
2. To make money from the price of bitcoins going up.
3. I do anticipating purchasing bitcoins in the future but do not know how often or the approximate amounts and hopefully I will be able to time the market and make money.
And for fun you might ask a question in return like: I heard that FDIC insurance limits were lowered at the end of 2012. Is that true? Is my money safe in the bank?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:40:29
I think 1oz of gold and if it gets particularly unruly then around $3,500 and probably sometime in Feb or early March.
If you look at transaction fees in USD for April 2013 then it was around $2,000-3000 per day. Currently those fees are around $30,000-40,000 per day. Even more so look at the 200 day moving average of Bitcoin's market cap and transaction fees in USD. So on a fundamental and technical basis Bitcoin is appearing very undervalued.
Even more so is with all the infrastructure that has been built out and network effects taking place.
Ironically, Bitcoin could be cheaper, based on fundamentals and technicals, at $500 today than it was in January at around $20.
With the float as small as it is and so much capital trying to move into Bitcoin along with its tiny size relative to other assets, currencies, economies, etc. things could get crazy. Just check out the infographic at  to get a comparison.

A couple years ago I logged into Paypal to make a monthly salary payment to my virtual assistant in the Phillippnes who edited videos for me and had just had a new child and his wife was in the hospital. He really needed his salary to pay for the hospital visit.
For some reason, Paypal had frozen my account and sent a physical letter to verify my address. After I finally received the letter about 7-10 days later because the USPS is so fast I was able to put in the PIN and send my assistant his salary.
Perhaps to feel safer with your money in Bitcoin you need to have your Paypal, bank account or other assets arbitrarily frozen without any cause, due process, court order or legitimate reason. Then you might feel a little safer with your value in Bitcoin where as long as you have the private key you can access your money.

That bug was quickly squashed, is in a fork that has been abandoned (so technically never happened in the current Bitcoin fork) and there have been no similar instances since.
The problem with Paypal is the balance can be debited or credited at will because it is merely double entry bookkeeping. With Bitcoin, using financial cryptography, the inputs and outputs are verified by the network which results in triple entry bookkeeping. Thus, balances must balance. With Paypal there is no guarantee, in the software code, that the balances are correct. For all we know Paypal could be fractional reserving and therefore be insolvent if everyone demanded delivery of their demand deposits. With Bitcoin there can be no fractional reserving but only with Bitcoin services like the exchanges, etc.

 I was at an open house with a bunch of my Bitcoin friends in SF two nights ago and we were talking about brokering some large deals. Based on the conversations with those of us who help create dark pool transactions there are 10+ buyers for $1m+ each and no sellers at the current price.
Those buyers were offered at MtGox weighted average +$10 starting when it was around $205 and they refused each opportunity on up and still have not had any orders filled. Plus, I am aware of some other really large buyers taking control of all the available float.
So, good luck establishing a large BTC position since everyone already has large USD positions.

Another idea is for a WordPress plugin I have been discussing with some others. Could combine advertising with the bitcoin gem idea and then create a marketplace like Cranky Ads for scaled ad inventory.
A free WP plugin; remove the uncertainty element; have it pay X% to the developer; Y% to the website operator; advertisers would create a bid with a URL and image which would be fill the advertising slot; there would be a time decay after Z days at P% on the cost to buy the gem
So the website operator would set the variables like payout address, Y% of revenue to keep, image pixel dimensions, would put the tag into the sites where it would show up like [bitcoin-gem image-1], and set the P% decay percentage and the Z days. Then the page where advertisers can see the rates would show the terms.
Could also have a centralized marketplace where advertisers could go to see the current inventory of aggregated sites and the costs, etc.
Which would interact with the plugin via API key, etc.

Good to see a budding Bitcoin entrepreneur!
If I were you then I would start on this to-do list:
1. Get a Basic Plan from Ice Servers (Bitcoin accepted!) for about $5 - 
2. Use their Wordpress install (free and open source)
3. Sign up for a Fulfillment-By-Amazon (FBA) account - The largest cost to the consumer for your bags is the $6 shipping plus you have to do work packing and shipping then. By using Amazon Fulfillment your bags will benefit from Free Super Saving Shipping on $25+ orders and Prime so many customers will add your bags to their orders so they get pushed above the $25 and not have to pay shipping. That can make the net cost to your customers $2-3 per bag instead of $16. Plus, Amazon will handle all the exporting stuff to 65+ countries. Plus, you will benefit from only making one shipment to Amazon, not having to handle returns and them doing the storing, picking, packing and shipping at the time a customer orders the bags (more freedom for you to vacation instead of fulfillments!).
4. Sign up for Bitpay.com merchant processing (use Blockchain.info to manage your own wallet - install the Firefox or Chrome extensions depending on the browser you use)
5. Get and install the Bitpay.com FBA plugin -  - Watch the Fulfillment-By-Amazon videos and check out the FBA YouTube Channel to see the possibilities
6. Once you have the software infrastruce in place with a working website, merchant processor and FBA account then you can start making a decent amount of inventory (take advantage of the economies of scale). Fortunately, up to this point your only costs so far are the $5 hosting account and perhaps the Woo eCommerece suite to integrate with Bitpay.
7. Perhaps negotiate and pay a royalty to nagdude for some designs- 
8. Ship a bunch of the finished bags to Amazon for the FBA
9. Start advertising your website and products. Perhaps places like the Bitcoin forums, Bitcoin Magazine, etc.
10. Work on creating your brand and branching out into other potential products like shirts, posters, chalk-bags, bowling bags, backpacks, fanny packs, etc. and leveraging existing infrastructure like Zazzle.com, etc. in addition to FBA.
11. Keep plugging along and do not get discouraged!
12. After your business starts to take off then you can work on streamlining, automating and outsourcing the work, like sewing, etc.

@_date: 2013-07-01 00:48:18
It can happen but is rather unlikely. This is because with Bitcoin the cost of storing and securing bitcoins is fairly low and easy to do. So a bank will have to persuade holders of capital to store with the bank instead of by themselves. This has costs like potential seizure, counter-party risk, etc. so banks will likely have to pay significant interest.
But the biggest deterrent will be that banks will have to get informed consent from holders of capital. In the current system individuals and corporations are, for the most part, have their deposits at banks either without full disclosure or against their will but with no viable alternatives.
Bitcoin is a censorship resistant competitor that has clawed its way to where it is in spite of all the regulation, that acts as price ceilings and floors, designed to thwart financial innovation and competition. Thus, this industry will be innovated in spite of what all the entrenched special interests from the merger of bank and State want.

3. Bitcoin-QT (the main client that is taking forever to download the blockchain. Kind of clunky but much more secure than Blockchain.info)
4. Armory (the most secure, offline transaction signing, etc. Fairly hard to use interface and for the most advanced bitcoin users. But if you need to protect significant amounts of capital then Armory is the way to go. There is a new version in the process of being released that is much more usable with regards to the RAM issue.

His entire argument is in favor of tools that use politicized currency to engage in political persecution. The United States Supreme Court has been very clear about the need for anonymous freedom of speech. And with crypto-currency, being built out of cryptography which was ruled protected under the First Amendment by the USSC, it is merely a form of speech and so its consequence of freedom of transaction is another fundamental human right to be protected.
What about Wikileaks and the banking blockade?
What about Tariq Aziz, a 16 year old, who was targeted and assassinated by the Obama administration via drone because he had disclosed pictures to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism of 175+ children who had been killed in drone strikes.

Coupled with the market, at these prices, being just way too small for these type of fund flows.

I am not sure why Gregory Maxwell (nullc) is asserting disrespect or hostility in the debate since all of my communications were drafted the same way I would draft pleadings for a judge; professionally and pointedly contentious on the issues. And the implication of physical threat from me is completely baseless and extremely unprofessional. I merely pointed out as a courtesy to Mr. Maxwell that his comments about someone else, thus I would lack standing to sue, could amount to defamation.
Additionally, because Mr. Maxwell and Jeff Garzik did not articulate soundly reasoned arguments I drafted, objectively, both sides of the arguments before you both retreated into your cave due to the mounting pressure from the vast majority of the Bitcoin community. Sure, the arguments were pointed and sharp on the issues but in no way were they aimed in a personal manner at either you or LukeJR. 
For those unaware of the backstory when developing the Bitcoin.org Press Page with Saivann and Mike Hearn it was LukeJR, another candidate for this Foundation board seat, that led the charge on voting to exclude Jon Matonis, currently executive director of the Foundation and Founding Member and Roger Ver, a Founding Member of the Foundation and significant financial contributor, and it was Trace Mayer and Joerg Platzer, another candidate for this Foundation board seat, who argued for inclusion of both. Here are a few of the Github threads (139, 152, 162) and one of the Bitcointalk discussions [ (24 pages! - very hot topic and healthy debate in the community which seemed to settle on inclusion).
Some Bitcoin community members were so incensed at the behavior of LukeJR and Gregory Maxwell to exclude competent, professional and articulate speakers that they took significant action. For example, Andreas Antonopoulos created the Bitcoin Press Center.

I have been wondering lately what effect Bitcoin is going to have on demographics. I have been wondering if people would change their economic calculation with regards to family formation if they knew just how costly that current consumption is with a savings instrument that is, more or less, constantly appreciating in value.
For example, if the little one had current USD costs of $10,000 a year ago that required liquidation of a BTC holding then the opportunity cost would be about 800BTC or around $400,000 in current value. Makes me wonder how many people would delay having children for a year or two in order to save more BTC so they would then be in an even more solid financial footing for the children, particularly in this recessionary environment where we already see family formation being significantly delayed.

Mr. Maxwell's potential defamation of someone else, which I pointed out, would not give me a cause of action to drag him into court (which I most likely would not do anyway since it would be against my principles).
But he does point out an very important issue: Whether our Bitcoin developers are adequately protected legally?
With subpoenas, cease and desists, etc. already having been sent out I think this is an area of preemptive protection that needs more work done. In fact, one of my friends who only develops software received one of the subpoenas.
Before either the subpoenas or C&amp;Ds went out I raised the issue of a Bitcoin legal defense fund with Patrick Murck at the June Conference. Patrick recommended Brian Klein as chairman so I traveled to Santa Monica to meet with him and then we setup the Bitcoin Legal Defense Committee.
And it is precisely contributors and developers like Mr. Maxwell, those who are contributing code pro-bono, that I would like to see primarily and directly protected by this legal shield.

This issue of tax, particularly a potential national sales tax in the US, is extremely important in the context of Amazon's FBA. A creative entrepreneur will be able to route around it pretty easily which will allow arbitrage opportunity in price for customers. It will be increasingly difficult for the larger targets, like Amazon, to maintain their margins. But by decentralizing the merchants but still having centralized warehousing and fulfillment it is a potential route around; particularly for non-US persons.

Litecoins reached $5 before moving down to around $3.5 today. So he realized a 194% return, or $10,560, but missed out on a 7,250% return, or $394,560 and is feeling seller’s remorse.
Kind of the opposite of David Choe who could have gotten a few thousand dollars for painting a mural at Facebook but instead got stock that turned into $200m. You have to be in it to win it!"

If I cared more about the financial well being of my friends or family then I would have given them Bitcoin wallets when I first really started plowing money into it around $0.25. Today a $25 gift from back then would be worth about $65,000. But then I do not really care that much and think they can learn and earn their own financial well being. After all, the wealth will flow to those who are worthy of it.
But on the other hand, I cannot tell you how many people have either thanked me for introducing them to Bitcoin or expressed regret about not having met me sooner to learn about Bitcoin.
Plus, there is a saying that he who gives money gives some; he who gives time gives more and he who gives of himself gives all.
In this case, your girlfriend's brother offered a gift from himself (his technological understanding and competence; a gift the other family members may not be capable of obtaining themselves) to the other family members. And it is very possible that this selfless gift could turn out to be a significant value in the years ahead.
And unlike me, if Bitcoin becomes extremely valuable then he will be able to look back at this Christmas and always tell the friends and family there 'I tried to help you understand it. The reason you have not benefited financially from the Bitcoin bull market is your own fault.'

"but it makes me feel shitty that I have less ability then the people stated."
 you may do better to take some responsibility for your own situation.
For example, why are you letting other people 'make' you feel a particular way? And would it not be a better use of your time and attention to focus on improving your situation instead of being jealous and envious of others who have greater mental capacity than you and use the tools of the Information Age to multiply their mental powers.
And just imagine if they were not significantly handicapping themselves by using substances which could have a negative effect on their cognitive functions? Or what if they actually used substances, like nootropics, to enhance their cognitive abilities? Do you think your whining about being so stupid relative to them is really going to help your situation?
It sounds like you need to do a little more study on biohacking and brainhacking, spend a significant amount of time on dual n-back training, get a lot more high quality MCT oil and grass fed butter with butyrate in your diet, see if there are any other substances like Alpha Brain that could help and generally just take more responsibility for where you are and then work to improve your situation.

Bitcoin is tiny compared to other assets, economies, currencies, etc. Just take a look at the infographic here: 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:27:34
And that question [stabilizing bitcoin prices] is irrelevant and unanswerable anyway under subjective value theory and general theories of praxeology. Bitcoin is very simple.
The supply is fixed and there are only two components of demand: speculative [savings, hoarding, etc.] and transactional. The price is irrelevant to transactional demand because it performs the utility of transferring value equally well at $0.05 as it does at $10,000 per bitcoin so the transactional demand is inelastic to price. Exchange rate risk can be eliminated for both customer and merchant since there are already wallet applications which exist that allow you to hold dollars and covert to bitcoins for payments in addition to merchant payment processors like Bitpay.
Thus, the price varies as a result of speculative demand and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution does not play much of a role until there is greater a substitution effect of bitcoins in currency choice relative to the generally accepted fiat currencies. WIth regard to speculative demand bitcoin is a possible substitute for so many assets from fine art to offshore tax haven bank accounts to gold, etc. In other words, Bitcoin would have a inverse correlation to quantatitive easing. After all, interest rates regulate production over time and most bitcoin speculators use fiat currencies as their numeraire and not bitcoin so that is how they calculate their interest rates, WACCs, risk-free rates, etc. and bitcoin behaves like a Giffen good. But it still reduces down to subjective value theory.
This stuff is really not that complicated. Perhaps you need a better grounding in the Austrian school?

You allocate the % of BTC or USD (or other fiat currency) and Bitpay automatically process payments that way.
I think it should be pretty easy to get a pump setup so people could send bitcoins to a QR code displayed on it and it would load the pump with 'prepaid' credit just like if the cashier in the store accepted cash. Probably a weekend project for some developer to work on.
I think gas stations would be a huge hit. They already have razor thin margins. People will really jump through hoops to get the lowest price of gas. With Coinbase and mobile apps it is pretty easy to acquire bitcoins and not pay a huge spread.

Agreed, I think many underestimate the potential risk of a civil contempt resulting in incarceration. Using Bitcoin to evade or frauduluently convey assets away to keep legitimate creditors from seizing them is a recipe for making one's life incredibly difficult.
And even if one evades the creditors and does not get thrown in the pokey the creditors can still forgive the debt, take a deduction and hit the debtor with a 1099 for income. Then the IRS just may decide to revoke one's passport for delinquent tax debt.
Either way, the siren song of Bitcoin's non-seizability may be enticing but given the plausible deniability when it comes to owning addresses it could get really bad if a judge does not believe the debtor's assertion of not having control of an address since there is little recourse to civil contempt.

Bees Brothers uses Bitpay which has no account setup fee, no monthly fee and charges only 1% to process and includes exchange and daily direct deposit. So there is no risk for Robertson Shams to start accepting it.

yishan, having an accounting and legal background I find it rather odd that your accountants spend so much time on this since, for now, there is only one type of product in the settlement.
I am not familiar with how Coinbase does the processing but from my use of Bitpay they seem to make this extremely easy since the revenue recognition amount is equal to the direct deposit amount and there would be no issue with forex fees or gain/loss recognitions.
You might also want to pick up a copy of our guide A Lawyer's Take On Bitcoin And Taxes since there are several reasonable approaches you can take when it comes to revenue recognition.
The bottom line is that you should be able to get this to 'would pass an audit' confidence with very little effort as Bitpay already provides reports that do all of that. Perhaps you can get Coinbase to develop the same code? There is a reason you pay the transaction fee; to save your accountant's time.
Also, I would be interested in knowing if you are using some higher grade software like Netsuites, SAP or Oracle. If so perhaps you can PM me and we can discuss some issues unique to those higher grade accounting systems as there is a lot of effort that may need to be done to really integrate Bitcoin into the accounting and finance guts.

Frustration usually comes from unmet expectations.
If they are so worried about fraud, which is legitimate, then why not hold the bitcoins over a particular threshold for a period of time. Sure, they should give notice of the threshold and the period of time but it would sure help set expectations properly.
For example, I have several people (7+ emails in Feb alone) who want to buy material amounts of bitcoins. I have recommended Coinbase but told them that they will likely not be able to buy the 100 BTC per day for the next 30 days (moving at least $50-100k into bitcoins) even though that is what Coinbase recommends and if they want to acquire the batches of bitcoins then we should likely do an off-market transaction or go directly to MtGox. Because of the added convenience and the time it would save them (compared to MtGox or off-market) I am sure these potential customers would have little or no issue leaving the bitcoins in Coinbase for 30 days, etc. to toll some 'fraud' period.

I am more interested in the macro demographics and really any debate.
Interest rates regulate production and consumption over time and it seems that Bitcoin's real interest rate is extremely high which greatly discourages current consumption. Why spend $55,000 today when it might be $6,000,000 in 18 months? I think it could have a profound effect on changing the economic calculation in a macro sense.
China seems to be having problems with their birth rate and recently relaxed the one child policy in the latest round of updates. Europe's birth rate is cratering. Japan's is even worse. The US seems to be delaying family formation.
The declining birth rate could have all types of effects on real estate prices, GDP, stock valuations, economic growth rates, etc. And coupled with a currency like Bitcoin that greatly encourages savings versus consumption it seems like if Bitcoin were to go viral then we could see an even sharper decline in birth rates.

For your retail store you may want to consider using Bitpay.com.
Wording for a contract would look something like this:
'Payment of X bitcoins shall be made by Buyer to wallet address Y.' It is really not much different than a contract for an amount of apples, oil or wheat. Additionally, under the UCC restatements a large change in price is neither a defense nor an excuse for failure to perform and cannot generally be used for impossibility, impracticability, etc.
'For purposes of valuation the weighted average price from MtGox.com shall be used.' This might be good if they accrue a debt because USD as legal tender must be accepted by a Creditor in tender of payment of debts. This type of a clause would establish how to value the bitcoins owed.

This is an example of someone who has access to a sound currency; the first time in decades. Sound currencies reward savers in contrast to unsound currencies rewarding consumers and debtors. As he saves instead of spends, on things like MTG drafts, he will accumulate capital. If the price of BTC rises relative to USD then it represents a wealth transfer from holders of USD to holders of BTC. This will accelerate his capital accumulation; whereas the other way around will dissipate his capital accumulation.
So the question becomes which holders of capital do you think have a more stable store of value; USD or BTC?

Customer acquisition is one of the largest costs for a merchant. A customer who has ordered 5-6 times is extremely valuable to a merchant because the customer is not likely to switch unless there is a good reason.
In this case, the merchant lost an extremely valuable customer because they did not accept bitcoins. If you ever get an email from them inquiring about the order then you may want to point out that you wanted to buy from them but because they did not accept bitcoins you went with one of their competitors who did. Then let them know how they can easily accept bitcoins with a processor like Bitpay.

It seems you are trying to grasp the difference between settlement and extinguishment.
When a transaction is settled then it is not completed because the other party in exchange for a good or service receives a financial asset that is still subject to counter-party risk which is the financial ability of someone else to perform. They receive something which is someone's liability.
Whereas when a transaction is extinguished the parties exchange a good or service for an asset that is no-one's liability or in other words a tangible asset. A tangible asset is one that is intrinsically limited in amount by its characteristics; ie. gold by atoms or bitcoin with numbers in contrast to USD, EUR, etc. which are limited in amount by extrinsic characteristics; ie. counterfeiting laws, promises, etc. (explored in more depth in this article: 
And you are completely correct that Bitcoin, or gold for that matter, is a much more solid foundation to build a monetary system on than fiat currency because it results in transactions being extinguished instead of merely settled.
