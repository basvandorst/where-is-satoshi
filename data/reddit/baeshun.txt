In my eyes bitcoin is far more a commodity than currency. I send money using ETH. I store value in BTC.

Creating gains is his job

They only become multimillionaires when that money is converted to fiat and not a moment sooner.

Ripple has before. It will again too, I’m sure.

Fuck off. I only hold BTC, I was joking that BTH was crap.

Awesome gains... but unless you sold you didn’t make anything yet!

You should be worried the banks and billionaires aren’t snatching up your commodity. 
Historically not a good idea to go against smart money.

How much?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:16:00
Honest question but what makes you think they would adopt bitcoin for this purpose and not develop their own cryptocurrency?

Take off your jacket
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:42:41
Just have to chime in and denounce your smug attitude.

Shelter, however...

Perhaps ETH will rise from the ashes. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:38:36
It’s even better
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:38:00
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:35:26
It will continue to be.

Regulate crypto
