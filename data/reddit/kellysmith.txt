That'd be interesting indeed, having Japan join the game. I hope that's right, it'd be awesome for all of us to have China and Japan compete in crypto. I saw Adam Back endorse them on Twitter as well, which was good, I doubt he'd ruin his reputation by endorsing a scam. Interesting times ahead.

He is manipulating the market since 2X got defeated.
Jihan moved the hashing power, Ver moved BTC, and shills are paying for fake news and these sorts of posts to spread FUD.
Has the community not noticed this whole weekend has exploited the time in between BTC difficulty adjustments to manipulate BCH?

China had its eyes on a computer hardware business. They subside many such businesses in China, the government is your partner in it. They didn't care about Bitcoin in 2013, they were simply investing in a new HW company.

How do we know it isn't the same people behind these new miners? All of a sudden we have very similar miners, with Chinese names like "Dragon" or whatever.  This is very typical in China, they have lots of factories producing same stuff under different names.

Yeah if you try to coerce a ton of bananas to become steel it'd probably take billions of U$ in bribes or something. Definitely more than a Bitcoin.

That's an interesting piece of info. I had no idea what the global use was. Still the cable diameters, amount of air cooling per hour and other calculations to mine just one BTC surprised me. It's much bigger scale than I thought.

Global Bitcoin mining power consumption, divided by 144 blocks per day, divided by 12.5 BTC block reward = power per BTC.

Kwh is just one kw over the period of one hour.
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:14:14
Thanks but no need to be pedantic. Power consumption does mean energy (time is implied).
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:17:19
Your point is valid and I don't think anyone's questioning you here?
My point is that I was surprised by the sheer magnitude of a mining operation to get "just" one BTC per day.
Big miners get like 20 blocks or more(100+ BTC per day). So you can imagine their infrastructure.

You don't understand quantitative easing.
They print money for bankers, not for people. There is no inflation because people don't ever receive this money.
But there is inflation of the stock markets and especially debt inflation.
The world is sitting on 200+ trillion dollars in debt. This debt will never be paid. It's virtual printed money for bankers.

This week everyone had a taste of the FED system.
The FED decided to crash the markets. They crashed the markets. Simple as that.
One bank, with a handful of people in it, controls the entire financial system by printing money. It's ridiculous.
Taxes will always exist but a financial system with an algorithmic money emission policy that no one can use for their own advantage is absolutely necessary. 
Right now the FED decides to print money to pump the markets (and their banker buddies).
You work your ass off all life. Bankers simply print money for themselves. It's a ridiculous system, everyone's living under a joke of a system where 15 families print money for themselves and control the lives of 7 billion people.
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:09:43
The banks get nearly free money from the FED and loan it to average folks for 10, 20% interest rate. 
The 2008 worldwide crash began in the housing sector, precisely the example you give to back up your claims. Ain't that funny :) - Your example of a working FED is precisely what *didn't* work.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:36:55
This is interesting to think about. Control ended up at a bank again!
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:18:52
You can't extrapolate your individual example to billions of people.
"My mortgage went great". Well, great. But 2008 did happen, it's not imaginary and the problem which happened in 2008 is still out there.
The FED kept printing more and more money. It's insane. The world debt is impossible to pay.
You will work honestly 9-5 for 30 years to honor your financial commitments, fine. But bankers simply print a million dollars while you work. 
If a large bank pulls 1 million U$ out of thin air, nobody will notice. 
Our present system is a massive fraud. It will collapse sooner or later.
Here are a few references:
This is insane. It's nonexistent money. Whether you agree with me or not, the current worldwide financial system is a massive fraud.

You started your argument dissing my post, but then presented zero arguments or facts. 
If you've got questions about what I wrote, please ask them specifically.
What would you like to know about? QE? Fractional reserve banking? Debt?
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:51:27
I guess you're right. 2008 wasn't the bankers' fault, it was the home owners stupid habit of paying for their homes.
Thanks for your *honest* debate about the subject.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:49:02
The banks used the money to inflate the stock markets. The inflation didn't happen down below in consumer products, it happened up on the markets.
What you call "bull  run" was just QE money pumping the markets.
They printed money to save banks and inflate the markets but now they're sitting on 200+ trillion dollars in debt, which is impossible to pay.
Average people did not see a single penny of QE money. You continue working 9-5 while bankers print money for themselves.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:32:17
It was not an awesome run. It was printed money used to manipulate markets.
I've been saying this since 2008.
Also it's not "a small correction". What you're seeing may well be a new worldwide crash of unseen proportions because debt has never been this high in history.
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:05:36
Are you denying the monetary policy of the past 10 years?
Seriously? I mean, you're pretty much asking me to show proof of the 2008 collapse.

The new generation will work 10X as much as others did in the 1980's to purchase the same living standard. The banks built an immoral system where they print money for themselves, which would sound pretty obviously wrong to anyone, but most people have no idea their everyday money is inexistent shit sitting on some virtual database. And banks can generate more of this virtual shit for themselves. Pretty clever system eh.
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:51:24
Bitcoin generation has a fixed rate and is controlled by an algorithm that nobody can tamper with.
If you want to be pedantic, then the FED doesn't print money either. They emit debt.
When I say "banks print money" it should be understood that private banks get very very very cheap money from the FED and sell it for high spreads to the victims of the ponzi scheme (you).
