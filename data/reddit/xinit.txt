There's a relatively common con that's used with big fish. Let them win a bit and then wish them luck and let them walk away.

There's a number of sites that have a good audience built and they then tack on a "blog." on the front of their domain name, and inherit all the good will the existing brand has built. WSJ, Business Insider, and a couple others that are escaping me at the moment... where even the same writers work, but without the inhibitions of editorial control, they can (and do) spin things much more in an advertorial fashion than they might under the hand of an editorial oversight.

Why do I come to your topic? To demoralize you? No. 
After reading the definition of your plan to *defraud* people out of money while *promising* riches to them, I decided to call you a dirty, rotten, no-good scammer. A liar. A bad person. An self-delusional greedy narcissist who couldn't possibly understand how illegal this sort of thing is nearly everywhere.
That's why. I read your site, and I'm calling you a fraud, trying to build a pyramid scheme to generate money for doing nothing. Slime.

I'd say that, as a customer of theirs, you deserve to see evidence from GAW. Proof of work, proof of hash, etc. Instead, vague promises and a "cross my heart I'm a nice guy" from a CEO that permanently silences his critics without explanation on Hashtalk rather than answering their questions.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:03:48
After being an early buyer at GAW, I came out about 40% up after I sold everything. Not bad for a couple months, honestly.
I've moved all my funds from there (except one prime) to cex.io to play the exchange for a bit... at least there I don't have to worry about some narcissist CEO issuing lifetime forum bans to people who ask him challenging questions.

I found out via one of the Hashtalk admins that there's only one person who can shadowban, and that's the CEO of the company. He's also the only person who can reverse the shadowban.

Maybe, if Stuart Fraser was speaking about Paycoin, GAW, or anything specifically. However, it seems like a generic comment on crypto in general. The implied endorsement is questionable, and comes just as likely from a generic pro-cryptocoin speech as anything. Why no direct mention of GAW's offerings?


Fraser is listed as "co-founder and early investor" but being the money man who's seeing good personal returns doesn't validate the offering.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:04:37
*THERE'S* your problem. You tried to use their support ticket system to get someone to talk to you. I tried that for a legitimate payment error on their part and it took over a week before anyone even looked at the ticket.
