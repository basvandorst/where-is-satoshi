Lets be optimistic.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:16:36
Yes. Set up 100 alerts telling you when bitcoin rises by $10 in increasing increments. When you receive all 100 alerts at once, you're on a bull run.

Full circle. But doing so would be him admitting he was wrong. I almost feel like he's too stubborn for that.

@_date: 2018-01-06 05:04:01
Very spooky, BUT... I work with big banks.. I won't even explain what capacity as its not important. The sheer volume of shit they go through on a daily basis means no human can possibly deal with all the 'noise'. SO apply it to intel/NSA/whoever... It's not good that they can use their hardware to spy directly on us, but it takes a human to understand the content. They may be able to record and check back later, but its humanly impossible for them to go through every bit of data they collect. This is bad, terrible even, but they cannot possibly do everything they want with that data and you can at least take a tiny amount of comfort in that fact. Maybe, just maybe, there is an AI running to filter through the noise and give them important information. Highly unlikely that AI is focusing on bitcoin right now though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:39:54
First of all... How do you screw that up so bad? Second of all, who the hell accepts Bcash? Idiots. They deserve that for their ignorance.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:52:44
Well... The "real" bitcoin is really just bitcoin right now because bcash is a shitcoin using market techniques to try to boost its profits until inevitably the "CEO" Roger Ver cashes out and leaves any of its followers to fend for themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:04:20
Is it just basically bitcoin/dash/doge/ltc? Seems like a really great idea for a platform and looks user-friendly, but 90% of all my coinbase purchases get dumped to another exchange or a private wallet anyway. Would be significantly more interesting to me if I could trade between more cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:57:42
Did you just speak English? If you want to argue in english you are going to have to work harder. I have no problem if english is your second language but I hardly understood what you just said. Whatever, go back to shill.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:33:07
I prefer to remain low-level anonymous. As far as I can tell this requires first name and email. I signed with a fake name, but this is precisely why we can't take this site seriously and why coinbase likely won't either.
Regardless none of that matters as Coinbase already made an official statement about prioritizing security, which in my opinion (and yours, though you may not know it yet) is much more important anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:55:25
Lol. Shkreli at least has some talking points if you've ever watched him defend his position. Ver just repeats the same bullshit lines over and over.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:59:21
Glad to be here with you brothers. Hodl for life. I shift some around between coins occasionally but have yet to cash out a single dollar worth of my crypto assets.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:08:33
Unfortunately "ignorance" is not an excuse. Despite a lot of us not really knowing what we're in for. There aren't tax documents for crypto so we're going in blind. If you have a significant amount you should definitely see a tax professional.

"Bcash Sucks"
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:31:19
Okay okay... I get it and you're not wrong, but you CAN agree that security is priority.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:34:17
Yes I realize that but you also have to realize it is still in it's infancy. That doesn't make it "magic" nor does it mean it's exempt from any rules you're talking about... It just means it has a lot of room to grow and if you don't believe that then you wouldn't even be here typing to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:06:53
I'm with you on that but assuming bitcoin doesn't lose a significant portion of hashing power (aside from what its already lost to certain unnamed alts) the moment people stop using it in significant quantity all those downsides go away (again). Bitcoin used to be just as fast and reliable as any of the underused alts that claim low tx fees and high speed confirmations. It really wasn't even that long ago in the grand scheme of things. All these problems we're experiencing are relatively new for the space AND arguably good for it. If bitcoin didn't have these issues, something else WOULD HAVE TO in order for them to be solved. Pioneering a technology is not easy.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:56:27
There are a couple interesting ones to watch. Litecoin is a solid alt for sure. Bcash is a dumpster fire though.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:06:36
Lol you are braindead. GO back to I said no such thing. A TEAM of anyone cannot be decentralized. It's just a fucking team. They can't be centralized either. I suppose if they are all working in one office that would be considered centralized? (Not the case with bitcoin btw, more likely the case with Bcash though since its a ponzi scheme) How many brain cells are you working with? You may want to see a doctor. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:56:39
This petition is awful and its not the way to go about it. Coinbase has already stated they are working on this but they are focused on security FIRST. Anyone who has half a brain (or can look at the Mt Gox incident) would actually agree with Coinbase that security is  priority. I'm 100% on board with Coinbase being Segwit-enabled but I completely disagree with making it their  priority.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:12:56
The petition is not connected to coinbase. I'm not signing a petition that has about zero % chance of changing anything with my real identity.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:53:24
That's simply not true. Your 'simple math' doesn't add up. It's simple minded and false and you cannot prove it. I challenge you to prove it. Bcash is only useful right now because nobody is using it. What about the fact MORE THAN 50% of the hashing power of Bcash is coming from Alibaba servers? Seems good. Nice centralized shitcoin you're shilling for. How much are they paying you?
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:56:55
Likewise buddy. When you're doing that because of bitcoin advances (lightning network, segwit, etc) don't even dare claim its because of bcraps success. Your coin is less than nothing and it WILL lose the war.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:27:10
Sounds too good to be true, which leads me to believe you were paid to say this. Show us some sources backing your claim or nobody here will believe you (except maybe the bcash shills).
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:41:09
Or did I?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:24:59
Isn't that every day on this sub? We already have the bcash folks flooding us with this kind of content every hour of every day. No Thanks?

@_date: 2018-01-05 15:17:20
I'm going to use the one which has realistic motives that align with my ideology. Bitcoin. Bcash is a joke and would suffer equally if not worse if it had the same traffic as bitcoin.

You must work for the NSA then? You seem very sure of yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:24:30
This isn't exactly "bad" news, it's just what we would expect right now. It's just proof that things need to change before we're back to where we want to be. Could anyone honestly say they didn't expect this kind of stuff? It'll get worse before it gets before. The only BAD thing about this is that Roger Ver and his cronies are going to say this is proof that bcash is some sort of better product. When in reality it's a mutant shitcopy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:13:38
My god you people are stupid. I'm not on coinbase with a fake name I signed the petition that isn't going to work with a fake name.

Jesus Christ I spent 2 minutes on and can't help but feel physically ill. The amount of lies and half-truths on there is disturbing. Bcash is just one big marketing campaign...
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:31:28
Lmao Ethos is a coin? What the fuck we are talking about exchanges in here. Get out, shill.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:07:58
Incredibly good at proving your point you are (not). I've yet to see ONE decent argument from the bcash shills. The best I've seen is that we need to work together for cryptocurrency as a whole to succeed, which is probably true. As far as I'm concerned though Bcash is just a well coordinated attack against bitcoin so it can fuck right off and the war continues.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:59:56
Doesn't exist. The coin can be decentralized, the team behind cannot. They can SUPPORT decentralization, but what the actual fuck would be a decentralized team? People working for free, maybe? Don't pay attention to the bcash shills, they'll irritate you real quick and confuse you and probably even get you to second guess yourself. Bitcoin is the only real bitcoin, Bcash is a marketing scam.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:12:43
Lol good luck with your ponzi scheme. If Roger Ver can ever stop with the same 5 talking points when hes plugging your shitty altcoin you might actually stand a chance, until then you will be just another shitty altcoin. Once its worth enough Roger and his cronies will just drop you to create another hard fork so they can pump that up and make more money.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:49:29
This is the most precise and accurate answer currently in this thread. ANY ledger (theoretically) should be safe if it connects to the software without issue. However, you MUST initialize your own wallet. If you do not create your own 24 word seed then you don't own the private keys. Buy off Amazon, initialize the device yourself and be worry-free.
There MIGHT be some extremely rare instance where an expert level savvy hacker could bypass the ledger default security... But the likelihood of that happening is astronomically small considering your average scammer IQ. Don't buy from Ebay!

Yea my family keeps texting me asking if I'm freaking out. No... I didn't bet the farm because I knew this would happen... and yet I also have absolutely no concerns that it will stay this low forever.

You're not wrong, but that applies primarily to traditional investments. Bitcoin is brand spankin' new in the grand scale of it all. I think it's a relatively safe bet that it has a bright future ahead of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:32:09

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:21:00
I don't see this as a problem right now. Clearly it's bad news and I'm sad to hear about it, but it's not going to impact bitcoin as it has nothing to do with the market value of bitcoin. It is far more important that today the lightning network was announced and is nearing completion. Clearly this hack is bad, but in the grand scheme of things is $60m worth of bitcoin going to even make a dent? How many bitcoin are in circulation right now? This is only a couple thousand bitcoin out of actual millions. This is like when they fined JP Morgan Chase a couple million dollars for billions worth of violations. Give me a break, this doesn't mean shit.

This is 100% my own opinion so take it for what it's worth, but unless you are some Chinese warehouse full of miners you are going to be unprofitable. You are better off spending the money used on mining equipment AND electricity on just buying the Bitcoin outright from an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:34:03
First off. I'm really sorry to hear this. Second of all, I am going to repeat the most wise words ever spoke about bitcoin. 
"Your keys, your coins. Not your keys, not your coins."
I don't have a solution for you but you broke the  rule of cryptocurrency when transferring to an exchange without making 100% sure you were doing it accurately. Best of luck. There is a small chance you will get your coins if you follow support through to the end, but there is a greater chance they are gone for good if you did not send them to the right address.

For someone who is so certain bitcoin is a pointless scam he/she seems to have a serious interest in reading up on its current events. Sweet 'research' reading the title of an article and immediately off with the "I told ya so" argument.

@_date: 2017-12-11 06:38:29
That's a fair point but Bitcoin (and other Cryptos) ARE backed by something. The blockchain technology. Maybe I am going insane but it feels like nobody understands this. Just the other day my supervisor at work was bashing bitcoin saying it's not backed by anything. I didn't really know how to respond in the moment so I said, "tell that to my profits." 
He didn't quite get it, even tried to claim that the USD is backed by gold, to which I laughed and asked him if he knew what happened back during Nixon's presidency (one which I was not even alive for, but he was). It is hysterical and a bit embarrassing at the sheer ignorance of people. Why is anyone who doesn't have any cryptos so quick to denounce it as a "fad" or "bubble"?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:11:16

As much as I want to help and learn... I don't know if it's worth the ~130+ gb download. With the way internet companies charge on data overages this is simply not possible for some people.
Is there a way to contribute without downloading the whole blockchain?

Yes pls. This whole debacle started because of Bcash. It's still surprising to me to see shills come in here. YES the community, near 100% of us, would wholeheartedly take ripple over bscam. Bcash claims to be decentralized but isnt. Ripple doesn't claim shit but is clearly somewhat centralized. Ripple 1000% over bscam.

Unfortunately I think you're probably right but I believe in bitcoin and I believe in the team(s) working to better it. If you spend the time to really learn about it and take it as a relatively undeveloped technology then it can be very safe and sound to use (and even reasonably cheap and fast), but unfortunately it's not foolproof as you said. It certainly has a long way to go but it's a great rollercoaster ride. I hope you have luck getting yours back, otherwise I would strongly recommend not to take this as a knock against cryptos as a whole. I had a really bad experience in 2014 and it caused me to ignore the scene entirely until a couple months ago when I realized I could have been a millionaire had I just kept believing in it. There are great things ahead in cryptos future, but it's going to take time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:22:39
Gotta come back in a month too "in a week or a month" Remind that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:38:18
No reason not to. Watch all the people come post in a week or a month about how they sold at $15000 and they're sad because now its $30,000. Nobody could've predicted what we're at right now and nobody will be able to predict the future, but look at the past corrections and you'll notice a trend. This isn't the end point, its barely the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:06
You haven't been paying attention have you. The community is actively working to solve this problem. Bitcoin isn't stuck with high fees and slow transactions forever. Get your head out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:22:22
Hmm that seems unlikely. I had a series of withdrawals to SW addresses the last week or so and haven't had my account closed... Granted I didn't sell out on any Bscam so who knows... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:02:43
The real problem is fees. The fees and the fact people don't understand that they can't buy fractions will drive people toward other cryptos, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't necessarily benefit bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:18
You have a garbage attitude and are likely just in here to 'get rich quick'. How is the lightning network autistic? Maybe instead of dropping accusations and sounding like a douchebag, explain yourself. If you're so sure bitcoin will fail have you already sold? If so, why not? If it's going to fail whats the point of holding onto it? 
Just out of curiosity... are you young? Adult-aged people do not have this bad of attitudes and can generally speak their minds intelligently.

No. They probably just don't recognize the transaction. Just contact them and tell them it was not fraudulent and they will unblock it. Don't overthink it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:52:47
I had this happen to me yesterday when sending bitcoin to my coinbase account. It took nearly 12 hours to confirm. I may have used too small of a fee but I don't know what happened. It confirmed eventually. If it says pending in coinbase it should theoretically be on its way. At the very least you know you didn't send it to the wrong place.
