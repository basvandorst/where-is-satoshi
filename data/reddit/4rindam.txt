my brother keeps it in his usb drive or some kind of hardware, so is that safe?

in india rarely anybody buys ipad. iphones and macbooks are more famous here 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:21:08
not common in my country that is why i was surprised.

in india iphone is notorious for it's high cost. also we don't have those plans yearly plans like us have so that also sucks. 
in 220 bucks one guy can pay rent for 3 months in india.

I am more surprised that both your children have iPhone. In my country we don't get phone till 18 or until parents send us to live in another town probably because of better education.

was just surprised because it was quite different from our country. also iphones cost a ton here. even new 5s cost above 220 dollars i think.

yeah. it has more to do with tradition and customs i think. parents have always shied from using gadgets in here and think they are more of a time waster than being productive. though that's changing. but still kids usually get gadgets here when they are above 18 or when they have to live in hostel or away form parents.
