'house money' is the same as 'your money' -- you'll must more readily part with it due to stupidity.

I used to play poker a lot. I understand psychological attachments to money that are irrational.
There is bankroll management. Some money you can "afford to lose/ risk" - and some you cannot.
There are moves that are profitable but require risk, yes.
However, "only gambling your winnings" which is precisely the logic you're using is just idiocy and another psychological fallacy akin to not understand sunk costs and throwing good money after bad.
Tell yourself whatever story you need to, but if you bought bitcoin at 1k, rode the wave to 20k, then obviously now its 3k --- overall you made 2k (long term) ... but you also lost money as the price went down. You gained 19k. Then you lost 17k. Obviously no one can time or predict the market but especially money in hand -- you're not free rolling. Every nano-second, when it comes to stocks, investments, holdings -- the past is forgotten and memoryless. You have the choice to keep the money invested, predicting it will move up and down today, or cash out.
I wonder if Fortune 500 CEOs like Zuckerburg are like "well this business can crater 90% and I'll still be ahead." Ahead of what? No, "house money" is only a fool's term. Period.

After mass job automation and assymetrical warefare make the average citizen both economically and militarily worthless, and revolution impossible -- the remaining Plebes were treated much literally like cattle by the Koch Elite.
The only available jobs for pennies not taken by robots or holograms were two remaining vices of the rich that could not be outsourced to non-humans:
1. Fetish prostitution. Somehow raping or beating a robot was not quite the same to certain eccentric sociopaths with refined tastes.
2. NPC in live-action video games of the rich, to be slaughtered, in Level 1 or Level 10 or whatever the live-action "game" was. For some reason this too was more interesting for the rich to be furnished with live humans.
His daughter would have to choose either career. Neither of which paid much or had much life expectancy, but it is what it is. They had no choice. They were as powerful now, with military and economic forces so far above them, as a cow in its pen awaiting slaughter. There was no choice now. Only to scratch on, or give up, silently rebel, and be gnashed and sharted out into cheap cat food by the Robot police.
The Koch brothers had won. This was end game capitalism.

It's being propped up right now by bag-holders, exchanges, rats desperate to survive on the sinking ship.
Many people who bought at $20k or even $10k are in complete denial. They didn't "lose" until they sell.
But yeah. I think the only thing that's going to happen in the next 6 months is the delusion about "grand riches" will be gone, and bitcoin will continue to crater. To maybe $1200-$1500. Then people will be tripping over each other to sell their tokens for any scraps before all the money is gone.

Only deep philosophical platitudes are the new way to shill new buyers to hold your shitcoin bags.

It's just money. Money can come back. Health can't.
Live and learn. Nobody knows for sure what will happen to bitcoin. The question is, if you were giving $X,000 dollars today, how much of it would you invest in bitcoin? How much could you afford to lose?
That should be your guide if you decide to HODL or not.

Not an expert (other than knowing that Bitcoin is going the way of MySpace eventually).
BUT --- I have a feeling Bitcoin is just going to oscillate between 3500 and 4k repeatedly, as some kind of scammers/ Russian bots/ media/ pumpers dupe shills into raising it to 4k, then cash out on down to 3.5k, and rinse and repeat.
Now, I'm not dumb enough to put money on this theory, but --- if that were certain, you could make bank. (via greater fool theory).

OP is probably a drug dealer.
But they mean --- cash liquidity. Not fake La La Bitcoin tokens money. Presumably, Kraken can't give you your money is cash, only Bitcoin, because they took investor cash and ... converted it into Coke and whores. You got Madoffed.
Not saying that's what happened, but c'mon ... it's obvious. Liquidity = cash, not gold or other shit like bitcoin.
An alternative is that they figured out OP is a crook and the FBI is incoming, so they made an honest recommendation to him to take the 'Koin tokens or be completely fucked.

You're assuming these "Exchanges" are running for Jesus and haven't leveraged your coin deposits to the fucking hilt just to get some higher ROI so Mt. Gox-sucker can snort some more coke.
Either way, certainly, pull you coins from them to see what happens.

I actually never owned any bitcoin, waiting for $20 price to grab one for the novelty. Like 'remember Y2k?' -- that'll be bitcoin in a few years.
Maybe there will be a new digital currency that actual works, but my money is -- definitely not bitcoin. Too inefficient.
It was a classic bubble, just as I predicted years ago. Bubble McGee. It doesn't mean the CONCEPT was bad (but maybe it was) - just poorly executed, and the hype was all on greed/ speculation, not the tech, like everyone claimed.
The current tech may be worth about $20 a coin, if that.

This isn't relevant to non-brain-wallet passwords right?
Because you can guess a billion brainwallet passwords a second, and there is high/ instant/ automated financial gain, and no 2 factor authentication or anything.
And the public keys/ hashes/ knonce etc ... give you clues.
Because otherwise - Jebus.
