I have been reading about exchanging sites. all of them have people who lost their money due to hacks, or investors got their accounts closed, frozen (Coindesk) without proper explanations, usually exchange sites let them deposit money, but they don't let them withdraw their money.
Kraken(some review sites list this is as one of the best exchange site, what a joke) is also a shit hole, the same thing, money and coins missing, buggy laggy website, no customer support.
How do you make money of cryptocurrency when the exchange sites are predators to hunt people's money? Decentralized trade sites maybe? If I read positive reviews about these centralized exchange sites , they doesn't seem genuine at all, most of the time, it looks like someone ordered them from Fiverr. Binance, Bitfinex with the Tether fiasco, Coinmama.... All of them looks like scummy attempt to get your money.

Why would someone offer a service which does not work? Not being able to access my funds? Transfers gone? If you google reviews about those exchange sites you are going to find more than enough cases which are illustrating my points. There is actually a group of people on reddit who wants to sue coinbase. One thing to lose money due investing in the wrong coins and that's on me if that's the case, but exchange sites getting overwhelmed with trades making me unable to access my funds is on them.
