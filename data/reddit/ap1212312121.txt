F*cckk! This is the first time ever I got scammed on the Internet and I've been on the Internet for atleast 20 years. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:26:10
Hey can you list some of the firms? I'm very interested.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:59:06
too soon.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:55:41
Let them fight.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:31:28
Damn , I got scammed.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:46:27
I apologize for this misunderstanding. I meant to say "donated" but English is not my first language.
Earlier this year , there was a similar thread like this one posted in and people wanted to donate to that person.
So I did donated 30$ worth of BTC to that person. Then someone exposed that it was all a scam and all the btc went to a known gambling site wallet.
This was in January this year and the thread are deleted.

The last time I donate btc to someone in venezuela. I got scammed.

the transaction was in "pending" which is not even confirmed once.
What if as soon as he get out the door he quickly double spend with another transaction with higher fee. 
Guess what will happen?
The later transaction will get confirmed due to higher fee. And the original transaction will get rejected. 
People really need to understand the technology.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:45:52
Then explain why that dude keep staring at 0 for 10 seconds 
at 0:40 to 0:50. 
He was expecting a notification. But it did not work.
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:39:13
lol as a programmer I know the ios app dude messed up.
The automatic refresh doesn't work so he have to manually refresh. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:51:40
Offer him a coffee and wait for atleast 2 confirmations , due.
@_date: 2018-05-10 06:57:06
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:19:14
it's laundering just like in the movies.
@_date: 2019-11-08 07:54:35
A thai guy here.
2 of the 3 listed by your link are owned by a known scam company.
google it.
The other one , i don't know if it's working or not.
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:07:39
No need to. 
I'm sure any update to the system would be backward compatible to older wallet.
Fees are neligible if you are hodl long term.

I know what trololo chart is, but can anyone eli5 what is stock to flow ?

bot scanning mempool
@_date: 2019-10-31 07:13:37
This is why you should download the entire chain seperately.
@_date: 2019-10-22 05:34:11
you can always go to bitcoin talk forum
@_date: 2019-10-15 05:16:00
And now the btc is gone , I wonder if OP or someone else moved it.
No, not by me.
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:20:14
@_date: 2019-10-11 08:27:17
You gave too much hint.
Number of possible permutations is 
which seems like a large number but 
don't forget that an S9 Asic can compute sha256 up to 
12 TH/s .
Which will take around 13 days for single S9 Asic to completely bruteforce your privatekey. 
No I don't have any asics around here. 
Move your fund now if you don't want to lose that.

Yes LSI outperformed DCA but not by much , only 1.3-2.3% according to your paper.
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:38:58
You can calculate using the nPk formula : 
Any permutation that is larger than 2^128 is considered secure enough by today's technology.
But no I would not recommend your method at all. 
Because it's still deterministic even with the l33t cypher , still vulnerable to dictionary attack.
@_date: 2019-12-23 04:18:04
You should atleast mention trololo
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:34:08
The bad advice is yours.
The general advice to use hardware wallet or cold storage is essential because it prevents most if not all digital attacks.
Many whales keep millions worth of BTCs in the same address and they are all secure if they use cold storage.
Because 2^256(2 ^ 128 in some case) is so cryptographically damn strong , nothing short of quantum computer can break it if the attacker has no internet access to the private key.
The one that got hacked almost always are the hot wallets , meaning it's  private key can be access from the internet.
By using cold wallet (hardware wallet or computer with no internet access) create an airgap between private key and  the internet. 
Backing up seed pharse is common sense.

I don't believe in horoscope.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:39:50
Yes, if you encrypted it first.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:39:10


Good point. I'll put the decryption instruction on my will. Well for the pass phrase transfer method , I don't have the answer yet.


Good Point.It's just a short program with less than 50 line of codes. I'll just copy and paste and store with the encrypted text.


Just do the process in reverse. I did and it works.

Ddos attack of that scale requires a tons of money one way or another not mentioning millions of computers. In the end even if the attack was a success , the attacker gain nothing. And The bitcoin network will just restore itself via peer to peer.
So unless. You can just summon ddos jutsu of of thin air, it would be wise to use that resources to mine bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2019-01-04 03:02:18
So I'll give an eli5 answer if anyone interest.
Using Naruto as analogy.
Basically a DDoS is like thousands of shadow clone jutsu attacking one target.
But bitcoin network is literally ten thousands perfect copies of itself.
So you can use Shadow clone DDos attack as many Bitcoin nodde as you like. But when the attack is over every single node can and will restore back to normal operation again.

Seriously, I think he is dead.
I mean people die all the time.
Also I don't think anyone can resist the fortune and fame.
He also may never tell his relatives about his involvement in bitcoin.
So we may never know who he really is.
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:39:52
Y U NO use comma?
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:22:05
this is a big no.
rar password is very weak.
Use PBKDF2 atleast 10k iterations.
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:36:47
If you don't need cash then hodl if you do then exchange to fiat.
What affiliate network are you using?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:40:10
Most people are waiting for 6k.
So I'm buying at 6.5k
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:49:54
Do you got a link? I'm interested.

Physical things can be lost , destroyed.
Data on the clouds , cannot.
@_date: 2018-07-06 09:45:53
For the wallet : You don't need to identify yourself when you generate one.
For the coin : one method to obtain bitcoin anonymously is to mine your own coin. Buying otc or other ways might compromise your anonymity.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:18:08
With strong enough encryption. It doesn't matter if the process is made public. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:23:35
Can you access amazon Mturk from Venezuela? 
You can transcribe receipts for 1-2 USD per day. I think that's a lot better than  2 USD salary.
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:51:19
If I travel there with 1,000 USD, Can I live like a king for a week maybe?
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:51:48
This needs to get higher!
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:30:15
Just go to SG. Most crypto friendly country in SEA
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:51:35
Always sign transaction from cold storage.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:52:34
because nobody really use the coin.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:35:09
I wrote my own wallet. 
It's not that hard.
