Most of us prefer to support businesses what not exchange bitcoin
immediately for $. Charity shouldn't be exception.They benefited 
when bitcoin did go up and now they pay the price, but over all
they should benefit from holding on a bitcoin. The problem is that
we give Sean's Outpost much less coins that we use to give.

I am not aware of federal law that fit your description for US citizens 
and never heard about anybody who was actually prosecuted under such a law.
 Laws like "Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act" regulate businesses, not gamblers.

Your post doesn't make much sense. If  forum.ufanet.ru.
don't want your posts, I am sure they have way
to delete your posts and ban you from posting there.
Seems to me that the phone call was from some
 "concern citizen" who know you and disagree with 
I use to live in former Czechoslovakia, so know
something about censorship.
By the way, I don't think that Bitcoin will replace fiat, but
I think it will be great for internet and international trade.

You posted the same set of pictures a week ago.
The business still isn't on a coinmap and you don't even post there address, so nobody can verified it.
 If the reason for your post is to help the restaurant to get Bitcoin costumers (not just you collecting tips) put it on a COINMAP, so people can find it and spend there Bitcoins.      
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:37:18
Do you accept deposits? If not, why? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:31:15
I don't see any restaurant accepting Bitcoin on a coinmap in Philippines. Did they accepted Bitcoin just for this event? 
Great pictures,by the way.

I am confused. I thought this is Bitcoin subreddit.
Not cryptocoins subreddit.

If they can do that it could turn the company around.

Some guy post few ugly pictures on twitter and everybody take it as a fact? Who is the costumer? Who is the manufacturer?
 Hard for me to believe.

It is hard to believe that you are bitcoin trader and don't have bitcoins that you can sell to pay for food and rent.

For bitcoin remittance to be successful,somebody
will have make it easy safe and cost effective for
average people to use.Setup website where Philippine 
people find CLEAR and EASY to follow info how and 
where to buy bitcoin in particular country,how to sell
in a Philippines and how much the whole thing will 
cost them(not just general information).
Philippine exchange can run in opposite problem 
that Mtgox in US,too many bitcoin sellers and not 
many buyers which will result low selling bitcoin price 
and make WU and banks winner.
Personally I think we are still faraway from any 
meaningful bitcoin remittance but I hope somebody 
will find the way to make it happen.

 bitcoin users.They did show in a practice
how useful bitcoin can be and introduced
many people to bitcoin.
