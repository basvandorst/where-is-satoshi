Bitcoin presents a totally new way to calculate the value of a currency built on a network that allows easy global transactions. To understand why this might be a good investment I would make two assumptions : 1 markets that are tied up with dinosaurs and inefficient systems are ripe for disruption , 2 disrupters make a lot of money. So if you believe the current monetary system is inefficient, redundant, and exclusionary then why not invest in a technology that is none of those things and has the potential to be so much more. Moreover, as AA says - dumb technologies win because they allow anybody to innovate at the edges.

Everyone obsesses with buying at the low point. There is a level of shame associated with buying at a point that isn’t the absolute bottom. I didn’t buy at 3k - that feels like shit now that we’ve reached &gt; 10 for the 3rd or 4th time this summer. The thing is though - historically crypto gains are massive but they happen very quickly - within a couple months/weeks. Fuck this small fry bullshit - make a bold choice and buy a position even if we hit 7k, which I don’t think we will, upside is much more than a 25% gain - upside will be 1000% we just have to wait.
