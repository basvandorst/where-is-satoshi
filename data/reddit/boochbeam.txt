I have nothing to lose by believing OP.
You’re so edgy though. Be careful not to cut yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:01:14
Yes, exactly the same. That’s where the logic comes from. Owning investments, like stocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:34
It’s not self denial because it goes both ways. You haven’t won anything until you sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:15
It’s actually well accepted logic. You haven’t lost or gained anything until you realize the losses and gains. You still own the same assets. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:07:03
I can understand that now that you wrote it in a way that made sense. Your original statement did not say why would you **help** anyone subvert the justice system. It asked why you’d subvert the justice system. Full stop. Words mean things. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:31
Because money. How’s this even a question?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:10
Well, maybe OP is withdrawing cash from the ATM and depositing that into another account to buy the bitcoin with. There’s thousands of ways to get caught but there’s also thousands of ways not to. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:02:31
Pro Tip: Not having extra cash on hand to throw at bitcoin doesn’t mean you’re living paycheck to paycheck. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:30
You’re assuming the worst and that OP doesn’t know what he’s doing. With your assumption, it’s terrible to do. Without that assumption, it could go either way. Clearly you shouldn’t be withdrawing large amounts. It’s quiet easy to withdraw money and “lose it at the casino” among other  things. You just have to be smart about the amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:22:42
People would subvert the justice system because they can gain money from it. 
Hopefully you can understand it now that it’s a full sentence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:09:22
Meh, good luck catching OP based on his post. 
How do you know OP hasn’t reported the losses?
I lost $500 last year and didn’t report it. Hopefully I don’t get caught by the police. 
Hundreds make thousands.

You might as well tell people not to invest in bitcoin because you might lose all your money. That’s how investments work, risk reward. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:21:40
How do? You assume risk in order to have a chance at reward. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:09:12
Yes, because you know exactly what it takes to make a good one.

Where do you live that candy gets handed out regularly?
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:42:00
Have you never been to a bar? The margin per drink is huge!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:07
It could. It could not. Do you have a source backing up your claim that it’s very likely get caught? I’m not saying it’s easy to get away with it. I’m saying we don’t know the statistics. If you do, please share. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:28:37
How can you objectively say that without knowing the reward (how much total he’s stashed and gained from capital gains) and the risk (how vindictive his wife is, how good her lawyer is, how well he’s hidden his trail)?
I get it, you think it’s scummy. That doesn’t mean the risk reward is terrible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:45
It’s no different than investing in stocks. Risk reward. You may get caught and lose money or he may not and win money. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:32:14
This lost is so ironic I could have sworn I bit my lip for a second. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:50:37
What can I say? I prefer safety scissors.

All you need is a projector. It’s just tracing squares.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:19:41
Sounds like a word of the paranoid to me. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:19:23
I like your tinfoil hat. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:31:22
I’m not understanding what you’re trying to say. Wether he buys now or not, he lost money he would have gained if he hasn’t sold. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:22:19
I’m sure celebrities and public officials fit what you’re describing. The average high powered lawyer/doctor/businessman does not. They may live in nice neighborhoods but it’s by no means a heavily protected or even gated community. They live just fine too. 
That’s fine if you want your own finances to remain personal as it’s your god given right. I just don’t like the fear mongering being used to keep people afraid of discussing finances. Tact is definitely necessary and you should walk around bragging to the world but if you’re talking to friends there’s nothing wrong with speaking about it. Reddit is primarily anonymous (before you say there’s these expert hackers just waiting to trace your info and steal all your bank accounts, please don’t unless you can provide multiple news articles showing how common that is on Reddit). 
Trust me, it’s not secret. If I wanted to find a rich person I know just where to drive to and I’ll pass about 10 Lamborghini in 10 minutes.

What privacy does it allow that normal currencies don’t? Nobody here knows what’s in your bank account besides your bank, you, and the government. Bitcoin is taxed now so the government tracks it so the only extra privacy you get here is your bank not knowing. Not sure if that’s who you want privacy from but if so then good on you. 
And you’re the one who brought up salary talking about your hourly wage.

The same reason a bag of chips at a vending machine costs 3x as much as at the grocery store. You’re paying for convenience of the location it’s at.

You gain just as much as when you share anything else. I can tell you’re American since that’s the capitol of the “taboo to talk about money” culture. It’s also why wages are low since employers capitalize on it. Many other countries speak freely about it and do just fine. You also have many public figures who are publicly rich and they’re fine too. 
It’s honestly impressive how they’ve managed to capitalize on pride and shame, some very prevalent traits in the culture to get people to not do something. It goes along with that saying where if you want someone to do something you have to make them think it was their idea and not something they’re being told to do. Very effective.

And Ferrari don’t?

He sold at the dip so lost money even if he buys in now.

I keep hearing people say there’s a limited supply. If you can mine it, hows it limited? And if it’s limited, how many are there?
