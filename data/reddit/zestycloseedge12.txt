BTC FTW

Actually you know what, I do agree haha.. that is at best a very, very superficial analogy made by one who doesn't understand crypto. So i take back what I said earlier with this analogy. That said, I still stand by the difficulties in valuing it making it highly speculative (assuming one looks at it as an investment tool; if one looks at it as a currency, then that's a very different thing).
I do hope definitely that this can be adopted as a better form of currency in my lifetime, and to see  assets being tokenized and transacted easily in a digital world. But still, much to improve, to build up, and to learn about not just the first order impacts, but the 2nd, 3rd and even 4th order impacts.

I would say it depends on what angle you use. On an investment level perspective, it is super speculative. 
On a portfolio level perspective, it can be very useful. To do well, an investor must optimize both on the investment level and portfolio level. Despite the risks laid out, I myself have BTC and tons of other alts which I think are very promising, but 80-90% of these I believe will die off in 5 years time.
Ultimately, whether one should buy it depends on one's goals and background, no right or wrong per se.

I have to disagree with your 1st statement but I agree with the 2nd statement, day trading **is** gambling. In fact, even investing in traditional assets is somewhat a gamble, as it's a bet on the future, though it's a sophisticated gamble, because you can reliably calculate odds using traditional valuation methods and take calculated risks.
The key difference between investing in traditional assets (e.g. equities, bonds, real estate, infrastructure) and cryptocurrencies is that **traditional assets produce cash flow**, and that is something you can **objectively value**. For instance, for an infrastructure project (e.g. hydropower plant) with a 25 year PPA in a developed country, you can reliably value the asset based on future cash flows (though of course there's a risk of the government going bankrupt). And for all these assets, there are **minimum price floors** you can use e.g. book value, net cash value, net current asset value, etc.
Of course, one may argue that valuation is more art than science and is subjective, but compared to cryptocurrencies, crypto do not produce cash and there is really **no objective way of valuing it**. At the end of the day, it's **all about the cash**. No cash, no talk. And yes, I have seen many proposed valuation methods for crypto (e.g. based on mining costs, network nodes, currency supply, etc) - up till now, none are convincing or objective enough, as there is just no underlying asset or intrinsic value. Numbers are pretty much plucked from the sky, based on market sentiments and whale action.
That said, crypto can still be classed as a speculative tool that can be useful for one's investment portfolio. I hope for the day one can reliably value crypto, as that is the day when crypto achieves mass adoption and one can reliably value the utility that is provided.

BTC and cryptocurrencies are still at a stage where it's impossible to value them. There is no cash flow and as such, no way to determine its intrinsic value. It's akin to gambling in a casino.
That said, it doesn't mean one should not buy it. It can still be useful as part of a portfolio of different assets depending on your goals. It's just that if you buy it, **make sure to only use money you don't mind losing on it**.
There are just too many unknown unknowns with it - e.g. what if one day quantum computing breaks the network? Will it then go to zero? There is **no minimum price floor** for this as there is no cash flow and as such no intrinsic value that can be calculated objectively.
It's dangerous to assume that just because it always goes up since 2009, it will always do so. The world changes, new technologies appear, and disruption cycles are getting faster. Of course, it can be hyped till it becomes $250,000 in one year's time, or if fiat fails. Ultimately, no one knows.
So only buy it with a clear goal in mind (e.g. for me, it is a "heads I win big, tails I don't lose much" kind of allocation in my portfolio) and with money you can afford to lose.

Thanks for sharing. Actually I brought up the example as more of an illustration to show that there are still too many many unknown unknowns around crypto. That's why Buffet avoided technology, because it just changes way too fast and is not something that can be easily understood without a strong technical background.

Despite the earlier serious tone, am a fan too! Just counting down the years (ideally days..) when I can retire when this hits 250k ������ Good luck to all!

I understand, I am not saying that blockchain will die off, in fact i believe blockchain will usher in web 3.0, where assets are tokenized and freely traded with middlemen cut out. However, it will take time for blockchain infrastructure to be built up, for regulatory frameworks to be refined, for societies to adopt it and I believe this will come at a confluence with other tech mega trends like 5G, IOT and further digitisation of daily life.
So what I am really asking is **will BTC still be the winner 10 years later**? No one knows. In fact, the "winner" may not even be out yet. Doesn't mean I don't buy BTC, but that I diversify with a number of coins as part of an overall portfolio with other traditional assets.
