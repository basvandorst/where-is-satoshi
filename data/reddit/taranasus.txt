So Bitcoin ABC, which is their main node software for BCash, randomly picks whatever it wants to set the block size at, regardless if it's set to put it 1MB, 8MB, or whatever? So when a block gets mined, it's anyone's guess as to how big that block is going to be?

Never trust new companies, in a new industry, with a lot of assets. They will fall on their face faster than you can blink because they grow way too fast for their own good.

I somewhat doubt this is necessary. Bitcoin has been declared dead over 200 times by now for all sorts of reasons, from technology to speculation, from spam to down-right stupidity and it's still here thriving. 
Media campaigns are good for raising temporary awareness, but showing results do that even better. BCash is investing heavily in media campaigns and dumping a lot of money into buying domains, twitter handles and company supports, yet for all of their efforts, it hasn't helped as much as they thought it would. Looking at their block size today, I think they're not having a very good time right now.


Let's get the tech out, make sure it works, test it properly for any potential vulnerabilities and if all works well, then worry about a media campaign if even needed. I rather let the price dip more but have an iron-clad solution than raise awareness on an unproven system and when everybody's looking at it, it falls flat on its face. The media and central banking can't get an excuse to bash on bitcoin like you've seen in November, I'd rather not give them more tools to do it with.

Yes because the underlying piss take of a system that the banking system runs on, a system sticky-taped together over decades is infinitely simpler and more straight forward. If you system is so fucking simple, why does it take days to settle a bloody international transaction?

Jesus Christ the answers in this thread... Good job guys, way to help a guy out... Sorry buddy I'll try to clear it up.
Some time ago, a group of people disagreed with the technological direction bitcoin was heading in, so they did a hard fork to create a new coin out of bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash. This new coin is very similar to bitcoin but tackles technological problems like scaling in a different way.
Some time later down the line they became a little bit annoyed that they were not being as popular as they hoped to be with their decision so they started claiming that they are the real bitcoin and started to refer to the main Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core (after then name of the team heading the development of bitcoin, the core team). 
They then proceeded on a media campaign of sorts where they baught out bitcoin.com, the  twitter account, the subreddit and some other websites as well as trying to partner up with some companies to make it ever more confusing for new users and make them think that Bitcoin Cash is the main Bitcoin.
They weren't overly successful in their takeover attempt but it has caused some people to get confused and permanently loose money in the process by accidentally sending from bitcoin wallets to bitcoin cash wallets.
My recommendation, if you see any site referring to bitcoin as something else but bitcoin (bitcoin core, bitcoin legacy), run! As their motives are very questionable. 
This is Bitcoin, the majority have agreed and still agree since the split that this is indeed and has remained bitcoin. Any minority claiming otherwise is trying to push some sort of agenda and should be treated with caussion.

This is indeed not a certainty


This, however, is a certainty. Whether it's a different coin, a different off-chain payment system or a different tech than blockchain alltogether, it will exist eventually.
The first ideas of a inter-connected information-exchange network has existed more than 100 years ago. [Nikola Tesla describes this idea for future generations]( and he didn't do it based on a crytal ball, he just saw what technology could do at the time and extrapolated it.
Similarly, the working concept of Virtual Reality headset has existed in consumer form since the mid 90's with the release of the [virtual boy]( 
Once the idea is out, and it's obvious that it is a good and desirable invention, it will happen. Maybe it takes another 100 years, maybe it takes another 20 years, but it does happen in the end. 
This is bleeding edge technology that's on a level that most people can't even imagine, and yet the ones that are invested in it demand it progress even faster of fear that if it doesn't progress faster, it will die. 
It won't die, it's a good idea, it will succeed in the end, it just takes time.

Yo! Lovely post, makes a lot of sense to me. I want to be a nitpick about something. You said:


So you're calling us to action to do our own research into the quality of the Core team, which is fine. Then you say:


Now you come off as a bit of a hypocrite. When it comes to core, we should do our own research but when it comes to another team, it's that community's responsibility to bring the evidence to you. 
You see the issue? You're expecting people to do their own research, but you also want them to refer you to their arguments without doing this yourself. 
To fix it, all you have to do is provide like 1 or 2 references on why the Core team is so upstanding and now you've fixed the issue. You've become the rowmodel of what you're promoting and no longer come off as a hypocrite. 
NB: I'm not intending to offend, it's just a matter of text analysis and the message it conveys when reading it. (AKA No shade bra).

Wait now I'm even more confused. How is buying bitcoin an investment then? If in order to classify as an investment, the entity must result in the production of a good or service, sitting on bitcoin surely doesn't classify as the currency itself won't produce a good or service. Or are we talking about the bitcoin protocol which allows for decentralized banking... that would make more sense.

You have 10 friends. You want to give each friend 1 plastic coin. All the coins are on the table and you can hold multiple coins in you hand at any one time. Coinbase instead of picking up 10 coins then walking to each individual person and giving them 1 coin, they go pick up a coin, give it, go back to the table, pick up another coin, give it, etc. This obviously takes a lot longer to do.
Hence transaction batching. In our case though space and time directly affect each other, if time is fixed, space is malable, if space is fixed time is malable. Transaction batching means making one big request that says go from address a to addresses b,c,d,e,f,g and so on instead of registering from a to b, then from a to c, then from a to d ,etc. Writing address "a" every time take more space than writing it only once and since the block size is 1 mb, it means that transactions have to go in the next block and the next one and so on. 
If they batched them, they'd take up less space per block and more transactions would fit in each block.

I was just as blind as most people, had no clue how money works, no idea how it was made. The concept of someone actually owning the rights to create new money was definitely not something that was bothering me. All I knew is money = better living, better living = happiness. Ofc the banks need to take a cut, running servers and stuff ain't free, of course you need credit scores how else can someone judge if you're a good borrower or not.
But then... I dug into it. Partially because I was bored, partially because of what Andreas said (and I won't lie, at first glance he does come off as a nutter on a box in the square shouting about Jesus) but mostly because, and I shit you not, the mandatoryish pension schemes introduced in the UK.
The most frustrating thing with the current financial system is that if you don't look into it too hard, it feels solid. It seems to work, and then wealthier you are the more stable and reliable it appears. But once you really start looking into it it breaks down so fast, because it's a web of lies and missinformation built on top of more lies and missinformation.
Ill attempt an example, let's see if it works out: Credit scores, we need them because they are the benchmark of how trustworthy you are as a borrower that you will pay back your debts. Cool, but how is it determined? Oh well if you make your payments on time on your bills and previous debts. How do you grow it fastest? By getting yourself into calculated debt and paying it back, which makes the lenders profit. Okay so I have to generate profit for the banks so that my credit score goes up... Great...
Oh but we're not done. You raise the credit score to have access to even bigger amounts of lending so you may receive the privelage of earning them even more money. But yeah it's good cause now you can own a house or a car, and say you never have any financial troubles for the next 30 years you will continue to owe them. Awesome! You are basically an employee to the bank generating them revenue across a massive time-frame for pretty much no other benefit than home ownership, which somehow is both a right and a luxury in this day and age: everyone should have one, I mean our ID system requires us to live somewhere, but nobody seems able to afford one without becoming a bank "employee"
Still not done, funny enough. 0 interest credit cards. If you are a very good spender, and you always pay your CC bill on time so you don't accumulate debt, you will be less likely to be approved for a credit card in the future. Because you don't make the bank any revenue, so why would they have you as a customer? EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE ONES SELLING YOU THIS SERIVCE OF 0 INTEREST!
And the sadest most disturbing thing about this whole ordeal? This is considered "Normal". Fuck evrything about the current financial system! EVERYTHING!

There are so many people with crypto investments being denied financial services, it's quite ridiculous. 
I don't think banks/governments realize that by imposing these restrictions they are encouraging people to trade straight in bitcoin and not touch fiat at all.
I know that these kyc checks and money freezing have been happening for much longer than crypto, but back then alternatives didn't really exist.
Now, I see one guy saying he can't access his funds, another guy saying some wire transfer is lost. Fuck it might as well pay an x% premium to the seller if that's what he wants and just dump bitcoin on him instead. Better wasting just part of the money than all of it....

I said you are less likely to be approved for a credit card in the future, I said nothing about damaging your credit rating for this example. A credit score is not the only thing companies base their assessment on.

Does it give you like a tiny rush insulting people does it? Common you can tell me ;)
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:42:03


Yes you did, thank you. Now I can respond.


No, I do not think having a credit scoring system is wrong. That's a very sane idea. I don't think that an institution making profit is a bad idea either, that's how business work. Both, in isolation, are fine concepts.
My problem is, the idea of one feeding the other in a continuous loop. I have to borrow more, to be given the privilege to borrow more. If the credit score is purely based on my current financial status (income, assets owned, bills being paid, rent value, etc) that's perfectly fine. The problem comes that your credit score is also influenced by the amount of money you have borrowed in the past and paid on time which has an amazing double-edged property: I can determine from your past experience that you've been a good borrower and have paid your dues on time, but I also encourage you to borrow more in order to prove to me even further that you are a good lender, and by doing so you make me more profit in the processes. This is the tit-bit I have a problem with, the double-dipping effect it causes. 
Then It begs the question that: if you pay your bills on time, and your rent and you earn enough that within reason you would be able to cover the costs of the loan, why is that not reason enough for you to be considered a good loaner.
Or how about this, keep the whole thing as it is with one alteration.  Make your past borrowing accessible for querying, but have no barring on your current credit rating. This way, people won't be incentivized to borrow more money just to reach a target. If I earn enough to prove that I can meet mortgage payments easily, have a clean record of paying all other dues on time and have raised the money for a house down-payment, I don't see why I have to make additional loans just to prove that I will pay them back 


At least you didn't use the word "entitled" specifically. That's a nice change. 


Yes, I am indeed complaining. But the complaint is not "hur durr, house prices are expensive", the complaint is house prices are artificially inflated. Because a house, a shelter, is not a luxury, but a need, and capitalist market doesn't need to increase production to meet demand, because the demand is always going to be there, they just need to increase the price. You build a block of flats in London, company comes and buys them all out instantly and rents them back to you no problem, prices are driven up, you have to get more money from somewhere. Sometimes these companies are Banks, sometimes they are subsidiaries of a bank, sometimes they are neither. The end result is, I'm forced into a loan, what else am I going to do, live under a bridge? Oh but to get a loan I have to go through the credit rating process again, and the cycle continues.


Put yourself in the shoes of a much lesser off individual than yourself. The fact of the matter is, most daddys don't own a business, most kids don't have the security of falling back on a safety net set by their parents, thus they cannot afford to take any sort of risks business-wise. 
As a DINK family, with average wages in London (70K quid/year together), that's 4400 quid/month after taxes, here's what your life would look like. Your bog-standard one bedroom flat, nothing special about it, and outside of London, about 30-40 miles away costs 250,000. At a cost of 250,000 pounds, your mortgage over 30 years is 1000 quid / month with an initial down-payment of 25,000 pounds. If you wish to have a pension that will support you retiring at the age of 68, and keep a 34,000 / year income each, you would need to pay together 1200 quid / month until you are 68, and that's only if your employer is generous enough to match it, if they're not, the number will be much much higher. So now you're both left with 2200 / month. Oh but now you have to commute to London because you couldn't possibly afford a 1 million pound flat. So that's another 700 quid / month train ticket. 1500. Food's about 700 for both, 300 for bills. That's 500 per month left to live on for both of you.
This is, a double medium-income no kids household, that works in the center of London, but can't possibly live in London. Everyone below that is completely and utterly screwed. 
You are very correct in your statement that I'm not owed someone else's money. That is incredibly true. But I'm owed the right to reproduce, the right to a shelter, the right to at least a modest life, and I'm sorry to say but for the majority of people, that right is fading away fast. 
It's not fair to blame all of the faults on the banks of course, but trying to make them sound like they have absolutely no part in this fiasco because "they're just providing a service" is complete and utter nonsense. At this rate nobody has any fault of any kind yet the problems presist and are getting worse.

Right so I went ahead and plotted the 200 DMA on a graph. Loks like the 1.47x for today is around 10500 and we do seem to be going towards that price funny enough (i.e. correcting upwards)
The graph usually does have a tendency to bounce up a bit and then down every aprox 60 days. We are now in that 60 day period and if this holds today, we're going to start seeing slow increases going forward. 
It was unnatural how much it speed up. Let's see how it does going forward. 
I personally see this bump as a good thing. It forced the 200DMA up so we overall the adoption rate has increased for the foreseeable future :)

Why wouldn't you want transaction batching? Especially when it's a viable and elegant solution. The programmer in me dies a little trying to understand why you wouldn't do it. It's elegant, it's optimized, it's making the best of the resources you have without being wasteful. 
Batching in programming is used pretty much everywhere to improve performance in all kinds of scenarios. For example in videogame dev you batch together static objects in your game like trees and doors and scenery into a bigger object and you send that to the graphics card to draw instead of sending multiple objects that would require multiple separate instructions.
As for your security concern, I can just as well put the source wallet in a blockchain explorer and see how much coins the giver has given to other people anyway so I fail to see how batching changes anything.
You could, in theory, spawn up multiple unique addresses to raise security and then batching becomes useless, and yeah that would indeed make it a little more private, but at the same time if coinbase really felt that strongly about privacy why not make this public as a response to the backlash? 
Finally it's not exactly correct to say the network is unhealthy considering it's behaving 100% as expected under the given circumstances. There are now three separate improvements coinbase and everyone else have at their disposal to mitigate this issue: batching, segwit and lightning. Continuing to uphold that a system's not working when you're not willing to invest the effort in implementing existing solutions is like complaining that your car is not fast enough but being unwilling to instal a manufacturer-approved supercharger on it.

I love it when people don't have the guts to bring their conversations publicly. I don't have a problem. This is a PM i've received as a result of this post:


you're the one participating in a hostile takeover... Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, you should stop attacking Bitcoin... 100% serious, please read more sources of information, is a fucking cult lately &lt;3


Look, I find it really cute that you PM me in order to discuss this instead of keeping it in the open forum, so I will transfer this conversation back there.
In order to take over something, you first have to not own that something. Bitcoin Cash split off from the main Bitcoin chain, adopted a new name, and a new 3-letter shortening BCH. By all intents and purposes, the BCH group decided that they no longer like the direction that Bitcoin is taking and want to do their own thing, which they think is better, and I support that! Nobody should stand for anything they don't believe in, and if they think they can do better by all means.
Everything up to here is perfectly fine with me. It's sensible. Litecoin did the same thing and it worked out for them.
But then the BCash supporters invaded the BTC subreddit, knowing full well that the subreddit is intended for Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash, because the abbreviation is BTC, not BCH. This distinction cannot be any clearer.
Then you did the same with bitcoin.com. The site is not called bticoincash.com, it's called bitcoin.com. It obviously represents bitcoin, not bitcoin cash.
And now, the  twitter account. Again, not  different thing.
But then you're going to claim that you're doing all of this because you are the "True vision of Bitcoin" and "Satoshi's true vision and intent" which is exactly an extremist cult mentality. You're obviously a minority compared to Bitcoin. You have less supporters, less miners, less nodes and less market capital, however, you try to enforce your views on the rest of the world by claiming rights to something that does not represent the majority and claim that your opinion is absolute. Your community, as outlined above, use unethical tactics to promote this view and mislead newcomers into your way of thinking.
I encourage you, in an open forum and not PM, if you truly believe that what I've said above is wrong, to prove me wrong.
And just so I outline from the start, "Whataboutism" is not an argument, it's misdirection. If your answer to any of my claims is "what about the Bitcoin Core team and what they did with this" is not a justification or a resolution for any unethical behavior. Responding to an unethical behavior with more unethical behavior is, like I said in my OP, a sure path to mutually assured destruction.

Those two lines represent the average prices calculated over the last X timeframes. The red line is over the last 26 time-frames, the black line is over the last 12 timeframes. Because it's a bigger average, the red line will have smoother movements while the black one will be more aggressive. 
When the two lines cross, it can mean that a trend reversal is about to happen. If the black line goes above the red line it means that the trend is changing from bear to bull, and the reverse for bull to bear. When they crossed the last time on the 6ths is when the last downwards movement happened, now they're crossing again so here's to hoping that the dip is over and we can continue planning our next lambo purchase

If you really must, since the fees are low on their blockchain, you could spam their network with transactions and fill up their 8MB blocks. Then they'd have the same problem that they're causing.
Say they resort to their old trick and do another hard fork to increase the block size to 32 MB, continue spamming. Now they have a size problem and an internet bandwidth limitation, that bitcoin currently can't possibly have. 
At a block-size of 8MB, they'd be looking at 420,480 MB of storage/year of transactions, at 32 MB it's over 1.5TB of storage. Bringing up new nodes would be a challenge at this point.
Ofc, there is one small problem in doing this: WE'D BE JUST AS BAD AS THEY ARE.
My advice, let them do as they please. We should be focusing on how to fix stuff on our end permanently so they can't do this sort of stupid stuff anymore, instead of thinking about how to fuck with them

Yes, you'd have to wait a bit to gather multiple withdrawal requests from multiple people, stick them in one transaction and send it out to be placed in the next block. So you're delaying everyone's transaction by a maximum of 10 minutes.  


No. Transaction costs are determined by satoshis/bit (or /byte, can't remember) so having one big transaction with 1 sending address, 100 receiving addresses and one change return address (102) takes less space than 100 transactions each with 1 sending address, 1 receiving address and 1 change address. (300), thus the fee will also be way smaller.

I doubt that many people are using ACH specifically for this. Most people just want CC and that's supported by a lot of exchanges these days. 
I'm not American, so I'm not very aware of what ACH is used for, but I'm assuming it's used mostly for larger transactions. So that's a few people using it in only one country. If coinbase were left with only the ACH users I doubt they'd be in business for long.

Oh yeah, cause regulating torrents worked out really well... People definitely don't use those.


Fraud exists regardless of the currency. This is barely an argument against its use. Fraud doesn't exist because crypto is unregulated, it exists because most people don't yet understand it so it's easy to trick them. When most people didn't understand much about online security it was easy to persuade them to give you their online banking credentials, not anymore, and it's not regulation that stopped it, it's education.

Sorry I expressed my ideas really poorly there. The financial system rewards you better the wealthier you get, so to a wealthy person it looks a lot more reliable. Here's a few examples of what I'm trying to say.
If you're in a third world country, you hardly have any financial services of any kind. If you run into financial troubles you are completely and utterly screwed.
Move up a level to being poor in a 1st world country. There you have the benefits system to help you out, it's not ideal but it will at least help a little bit: public healthcare, state child support, unemployment benefits. Yes all of these aren't results of banks, but they are the result of a stabilish financial system. You move up a bit to middle class and now you have all sorts of niceties like overdraft and credit cards and even mortgages, having ruff month or three isn't really that much of a tragedy at all. Move up to upper class and you have all sorts of strange services like credit cards with personal assistant service and other crazy stuff that the middle class don't benefit. 
Yes these people don't keep their money in fiat directly, but the fact of the matter is the wealthier you are, the more supportive the financial system is for you thus appearing much more stable and secure.
It's hard to see all the poor and hungry and how they are being let down every day when you can get 10000 quid at the drop of a hat.

WOW This turned into a wall of text.... Okay...
TL;DR: Talk to your parnter and tell them that what they are sayign to you hurts you and that you requires some support in what you're doing instead of a barrage of negativity. If they can't provide that for you, then you have much bigger things to worry about in your relationship.
My SO and I definately don't see crypto in the same light. I'm more of a hoper, I think crypto as whole will change the world for good and there will be a point in the future where banks, in order to survive, will just exist as crypto lenders or some sort of service providers. They will not be able to make crypto out of thin air as they do now with fiat, they will live off of interest that is generated legitimately out of loaning money they OWN. Unless some smart contract software makes that aspect of banking redundant as well.
Sorry I'm getting off track: My partner is a realist, she lives in the now more than in the future, and in the now you depend on a bank for pretty much everything as a middle-class foker in a 1st world country. 
HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I have presented her with the evidence of what crypto is doing. Not bullshit or wishfull thinking, but hard facts: Venezuelans and Argentinians are moving into crypto, crypto is a digital asset that cannot be forged or created out of thin air, it has survived and thrived for over 9 years now, it is expanding and financial institutions are either adopting or fearing the living shit out of it. These are not speculations, there are facts. Bitcoin futures trading at the COBE and CME are not speculation, they exist. The legitimacy of crypto is no longer an argument, it's a fact.
Denying bitcoin's legitimacy now is like denying the efficiency or purpose of vaccines. So our of her own desire asked me to show her how to buy a little bit and store it. Not much, but enough that it represents a tiny stake in an uncertain future, which is wise.


Don't get me wrong, so does mine. Not because she thinks it's stupid, but because it's fucking annoying when it's the majority of words coming out of your mouth. If your partner was constantly spitting makeup at you because that's what they're into, and you wouldn't care much for it, wouldn't you want them to shut the fuck up?
Making a profit counts for nothing if the first thing that comes out of your mouth in the evening is "Have you heard what JP Morgan CEO said about Bitcoin"?


That's why this subreddit exists. Your partner is exactly that "Your partner". He/She doesn't have to be your EVERYTHING. They can't and shouldn't share every single interest you have, every taste, every everything, otherwise you could just as well live with a mirror. 


See now this is an opportunity for a talking point. Steer the conversation away from bitcoin and ask them why they think that? Is the cash in your wallet in a bank? Is gold that you buy in jewelry in a bank? 
Don't try and throw bitcoin at them, that's not relatable, they need to first understand that they have a problem to fix and then be presented with a solution. That's how most new technologies come to exist. In 2000 i had no idea I need a personal computer in my pocket that can answer my every question at a moment notice. You take my phone away from me for a day now and I'll rip your arm off and beat you to death with it. I don't need it every waking moment but if I don't have it when  I do, I'll be pretty angry.
Same with fiat. Start small, and make them into questions not statements: "Honey, why is it that when the bank lends me money they charge me 17.9% APR (or whatever) but when I lend it to them they give me 0-0.2 % APR ?" "2% inflation isn't so bad year-to-year I guess but in 25 years our savings are worth less than half of what they are worth now :(, think we should maybe buy some properties or something?" "It says here that on average, in the past 3 years, salaries haven't grown at all. Which means that, if you account for inflation, we are now earing 6-8% less than we did 3 years ago..." "Oh you are going to love this, they've made this new thing called negative interest. Right now they're only doing it to business accounts but they're basically charging businesses a percentage of their money for lending it to the banks..."


Ultimately, I think you and your partner should find some sort of common ground on this issue otherwise it's going to lead to some really deep rooted bitterness down the line and it's definately not something you want. Here are the scenarios:
You invest both yours and her money:
- Bitcoin is a safe investment: Your partner is going to be happy that they have a good future, but you might be very resentful, thinking back at all of the nagging, bashing and whatever you feel now and will feel in the future if they keep "shaming" you over your financial decisions
- Bitcoin is a shit investment: Your partner will give yout the I told you so for the rest of your life and potentially blame you for all of their financial missfortune. That is NOT a situation you want to be in
You do your plan of hiding it from your partner, and now its purely your investment:
- Bitcoin is a safe investment: You will have been in the right and you will want to brag about it, especially after keeping it a secret for so long. Depening on your partner's personality they will either be incredibly happy and try to bank on the profits, which migth make you bitter since they had 0 faith in you to the point that you had to keep it a secret from them, or they will be angry that you kept such a huge financial decision away from them. 
- Bitcoin is as shit investment: Well... you're going to feel bad because your partner was right, but that's about it. This is probably the best outcome you can hope for in this situation and I personally wouldn't want to root for being wrong in this case.
Sit down with them, talk to them, tell them how you feel. My SO doesn't understand half the shit that comes out of my mouth half the time, but she still supports me and encourages me, and I do the same for her. I'm passionate about this, she rolls her eyes sometimes when I open my mouth because she's sick of hearing my BS, but she listens to me as best she can, and I do the same for her and her passions as much as I can bare.

Oh don't worry I've got my fingers dipped in all sorts of places right now.
My only concern with this is that, in order to do it reliably, I have to do it through an exchange like Bittrex. Which means I'd have to create a second account somehow and keep all that invested money in the bittrex account. That makes me uneasy.
If you know of a better solution please share! I'm really tempted to try this.

I honestly cannot understand how anyone can think that Bitcoin or any other alternative can exist without it. 
Does anyone really think people, regular Joes, give two shits about our decentralised, borderless, leaderless, consesnsus-based, open-source, digital currency? These people don't understand half of these words and if they do they don't understand how they come together.
You think people look at YouTube and say "wow, look at this magnificent platform, it enables the creativity of everyone and will even reward them for being successful without ever having to struggle with finding the connections or the complex means of reaching a TV audience". Fuck NO! They look at it and think "mmmmmmmmmm �� videos".
Regular people don't give a shit about our tech, principles or goals. All they care about is that there's an opportunity to make a quick buck and honestly it's one of the best things that could have happened to us.
There is a reason simple enough for regular people to care. A concept so simple that they can understand: put money in, get more money out, has better odds than the lottery. Yeah sometimes it bites them in the ass but most times it doesn't. 
This brings far more media and popular attention than our self-righteous goals ever could, and regardless of their motives, they are quickly and efficiently accelerating adoption which is what we need to reach our goals of an international decentralised etc etc. 
And, in the end, if adoption is strong enough, when a government decides to ban or over-regulate, you can also rely on these people to fight back, because they now have skin in the game and will try to protect it, thus resulting in strong opposition.
I don't care why they are here and what braught them here, all I care is that they are here and are getting into it

Correct. Causing congestion potentially due to having an inadequate car.


I do kind of agree with you here in a way. I was all for having segwit and such as opt-in solutions but the fact of the matter is, without being forced to adopt it, it didn't really fix much of anything since companies like coinbase had no incentive to upgrade their end.


Oh no, ofc not. You can't rely only on one trick and be done with it that's mental. But for right now they need to get themselves in line with the solutions we do have. 
I agree that a block size increase right now would also help the situation right now but I personally reflect the views of core that this should be a method of last resort. It's crazy to expect to do a hard fork and force everyone to update their shit, reach a consensus and disrupt the network in a massive way just because one company decided they can't be bothered to implement already tried and tested solutions.

This cannot be overstated. It's coming, it's just a question of when. It has happened before and it will happen again. The whole idea of a cashless society is to prevent a run on the banks. You'll just wake up on day, none of your cards will work and neither will those of your fellow man. Cash won't exist so you're going to buy food with?
Get Bitcoin, even a little, it might just save your life one day. Also don't be stupid, keep it in your own wallet that only you have the private keys to. If you keep it on a exchange, it's just as good as "in a bank".

I'm aware of the extent to which moderation is done on this sub yes, and I have to say I agree with it. 
What the lovely mod that's been commenting on this thread is saying I've been experiencing first hand as well. Every time I made a positive post or discussion on this sub about bitcoin I'd get the same toxic comments over and over that would come in and repeat the same narrative that's been discussed and concluded anew. This is not something I'm told, this is something I've experienced first hand. 
And of the users generating these comments, maybe 5% were not either brand new accounts or old accounts that would shun bitcoin wherever they'd go.
Now of this might not represent the whole BCH community and that's fine, but if such a vocal number of users exists on their side that have made it their mission to invade other discussion channels just to Troll, because I can't call it anything else, then steps had to be taken to make the abuse stop.
It's not an amazing decision, but what else can you do? let them run rampant until the community moves somewhere else and then they can take over yet another subreddit?
Moderation is not the same as censorship. This thread, and every single negative comment in it is a testament to the fact that there is moderation, and not censorship at work here.

That's a very nihilistic view :)
I'm personally trying my best to use Bitcoin and Etherium as actual currencies. It's a challenge, to say the least, but hey hopefully it will be easier with time. 
Funny enough my TenX visa card that hooks up straight to a BTC and ETH wallet arrived in the post 2 days ago, sadly because of the whole VISA provided thing it's utterly useless, so I'll have to wait till they send me out a different one. I know it's not PURE bitcoin for goods exchange, but hell it's better than what I have now (which is nothing).
I truly believe strides are still made towards making a decentralized currency. Hell LN proves that people really want this to happen. 
And yeah, of course, there are a lot of people that buy bitcoin just because they see dollar signs in their eyes. So what? They're unknowingly raising awareness and adoption. At some point, if enough people own it, they will trade it directly for other material items instead of fiat. 
If it's not Bitcoin, it will be something else. Whether it's free and decentralized is a different storry, but the trajectory towards adoption of a/multiple global digital currency(s) is pretty clear. Who controls it/them, however, isn't.

Partially to banks. The way it works is the government need money to buy something, let's say new roads, but they don't have the money. So they go to the central bank to borrow this money. The money is created on the spot and given to the government, telling them that they have to pay it back with interest. Upon receiving it back, the central bank in theory destroys it, but not the interest. The interest is their profit.
The central bank can also create more money independently of the government if they feel they should do so, and when you have interest as an incentive, you'll pretty much create if for anyone for any reason because they'll be giving you profits back. 
When the global market recognizes that new money has entered the market (it takes some time for them to notice this) the value of the dollar drops because there is now more of it. This is called inflation.
The central bank then plays with inflation and interest rates to keep the economy rolling steady forward, but because the central banks are run by an unelected group of people, or even worse for profit, their main incentive is to make more money for themselves. If you own the nation's money supply, you have an amazing bargening chip: do as I want, or the whole country is going to shit.
Thus these individuals do whatever they want and never end up in prison.

- He has managed to insult more countries and leaders than any other president in any history. This is not something that i'm seeing from "fake news", it's directly from his twitter account.
- The way he speaks carries no elegance, respect or culture. He comes off as a simpleton and this is not coming from "fake news", this is from watching live broadcasts of him.
- His supporters are... extreme, to say the least. The ones from are some of the most obnoxious, thick-headed people I've ever had to converse with.
- His approval ratings ar through the floor, which is really impressive.
- Under his administration, it is that your Net Neutrality laws have been completely decimated. 
- His actions are so incredibly against his own past beliefes there is a whole subreddit dedicated to keeping track of them: . 
Now this is all first-hand experience stuff, as a foriegner. I'm not going to even get into all the nasty news that's said about him.

The basis of this argument is wrong. A coin does not have memory and does not react to information-based stimulus. It is 100% random.
A market however does have memory and reacts to information-based stimulus due to the fact that the participants within market try their best not to be random, thus making them predictable. 
Therefore there is validity in looking at past trends to make an educated guess about future ones. It's not 100% predictable, not even close, but neither is it 100% random, like a coin flip.

Yup, buying a lambo is just a flex on wealth. Any sensible car enthusiast would love to drive one, but owning one is pointless. Ohh look at me I can get up to the speed limit in 3 seconds and raise the dead doing it. Lambo is fun on a track, that's it. 
Most people don't really want a lambo, they want the financial situation that results in owning a lambo.

Loafs of bread, cups of coffee, bus tickets, train tickets, minimum wage. Basically the same things used to determine the value of USD.
Let's assume that bitcoin replaced the whole world's money supply (which is worth 80 trillion USD according to [this]( ) so that makes it 3,800,000 USD per BTC. A loaf of bread where I live costs around 1 dalla. So that means a loaf of bread costs 0.00000026 BTC, or in more useful terms 26 Sats :)

You are correct indeed. From a current technical stand-point, they are very similar. There might be other differences than the block size thing and the ascii boost but ultimately, if you look at them just as technologies, they are different flavors of the same thing. 
The problem is not so much technology or passion-related as it is history related, as well as school of thought related.
BCH is a sub-group of individuals (developers, miners, etc) that disagreed with the majority on the direction bitcoin was going towards. That's okay, nothing wrong with that, competition and diversity is good. They've organized a hard fork so they can implement Bitcoin in the way they wanted to be implemented. That's again good to, cause maybe they are right and we, the majority are wrong in the end. No argument there. They named their coin Bitcoin Cash, gave it the shortening BCH and all is fine.
What happened afterward is the problem. Slowly but surely a group of very loud individuals started claiming that they are the true Bitcoin and the Bitcoin that continued on its normal path, the one supported and recognized by the majority, is not the real bitcoin.
At this point right now it's a childish play of who's the real Slim Shady. Whatever right?
But then a take-over of the subreddit happened. Swiftly and quickly the subreddit now actually talks and promotes BCH. Why? If they believe that they are in the right, and their technology is superior, why try and manipulate unknowing users away from the information they are seeking. It's misleading. 
Then it happened with bitcoin.com, then it happened with  twitter account today. No problem for months then all of a sudden subverted posts that have nothing to do with what these accounts were previously promoting. Why?
If you don't care about the argument, you can easily stand by and say "So what, war is dirty, all is fair in love and war". And yeah I can't disagree with that statement, very true.
However it's these sort of tactics that have put in power the current banking system. Subversion, Misleading, Obstruction, Secrecy, these are all the traits that got us where we are today. Thus I can't really trust a crypto that is telling me "we're for the good of the people" when they use the exact tactics that got us in this wild wealth disparity in the first place.
I'm not fighting BCH itself here, it's a crypto, it's a tech, it does whatever. I'm fighting the individuals that are using these tactics, because I want to know what they are trying to achieve and what they stand to win by doing so.
I'm not fighting Bitcoin Cash, I'm fighting whoever orchestrated the takeover of bitcoin.com etc

I have personally taken his statements and brought them unedited on this subreddit. My comments have not been deleted.
This is the second post I'm making to discuss this issue, the first one got deleted by auto-moderator for containing the names of altcoins, which is currently a deletion in effect caused by an overwhelming fold of altcoin shills invading this subreddit. How do I know this? Because a moderator actually answered my requests and clarifications. 
I've extended an invitation to the person I was talking to in private to move the discussion to as it is a neutral ground between and Every time I've asked people for objective clarifications and factual evidence to their contrary claims I was met with either insults or sware words. [Prime example]( mods removed it because it was insulting and not answering my question in any way. I kind of wish they didn't now so I can use it as an example.
Look I'm asking a very simple question: Why did the BCH community take over the BTC subreddit which, from its name, is intended for BTC discussion. It's a simple question. If the intent is not to mislead a community then what is the purpose?
I await an answer, and I'm sure no mod in this subreddit will delete a logic-based response that's free of insults and sware words. If you have such a response, after replying using it on this thread PM me a screenshot of it and if the mods remove it I will post it as the first thing on my [Bitcoin Node's]( site along with an explanation of why it's there and what happened for the next month.

At no point did I agree, consent or engage in a confidentiality agreement with you, nor did I request the conversation be moved to a private space. Also, at no point have you made an explicit request or even imply to keep the nature of that conversation private for any reason.
Having requested for it to be taken down post me publishing it by yourself is the definition of censorship. I will of course comply if you feel strongly about it and will remove it, but then you will be exercising the exact censorship that you are claiming happens on this sub.

How to stop Bitcoin specifically:  
1. A few individuals buying as much of it as possible and not leaving any for the rest of the world, basically killing the supply (Extremely unlikely)
2. A fundamental flaw is found in the algorithm which makes it hackable (Unlikely, it's been 10 years and it has the potential of being patched as well)
3. Worldwide ban (impossible, the only thing that the whole planet agrees on is the size and shape of shipping containers)  
How to stop cryptocurrencies (all of them):

Hey! Thanks for making this! 
As I am somewhat paranoid with banks closing down accounts of people buying crypto from exchanges this is quite the godsend. It's also nice to avoid the whole KYC ballax. 
Just be aware that because you made yourself reachable and announced yourself as the developer, if this thing takes off you've painted a massive governmental bullseye on your face. 
When I need to make my next crypto purchase in about 20 days I'm using this to see how it works out.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:09:50
Hypothetical example: Let's say you played Farmville like a madman, and you sunk in hours and hours and hundreds and hundreds of dollars in it to the point where you caused yourself significant financial strain. Maybe you missed a few payments on rent, and were in a bad spot because of this game. You've realised your mistakes and have bettered yourself, and decide that you want to start a non-profit to help people going through the same thing you've gone though, try and help them beat their videogame micro-transaction addiction. 
You create a facebook page to promote it, facebook obviously knows that beacuse you created a facebook page. You helping people quit their addiction is a direct threat to some of facebook's revenue and they don't want that happening now do they, so they will threaten you with EVERY SINGLE embarrassing, shameful or hurtful  thing you've ever said that they have a complete record of, including your previous addiction. The leverage they have on you is immense. 
Think they won't go so low to do that? Just remember that Electronic Arts are fighting the actual government in Belgium because they've declared lootboxes gambling. They're not gambling, they're "surprise mechanics".
And on a more macro scale, facebook will use this new data of your purchasing pattern to determine your political inclination, and then feed you the exact propaganda you need to hear so they can get the candidate they want in power. We know they do this through the Cambridge Analytica scandal. 
The company is cancer.

Lightning is certainly making good progress in that direction. Yes, taxation will make it less desirable but I think it's also prime for mass adoption soon from a political sense as well. 
Gen Y have started entering their 30s and are starting to have an impact on the world at large.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  and other people from this generation have started leaving their mark on the world of politics. They have a drastically different view on the world than the Baby boomers that currently dominate politics (Conservative or Liberals) and will have very different ideas on how money should be handled.

Again, not American so I can't really get into the nitty gritty of the situation with regards to illegal immigration in the US. I'm sure there are great nuances to the whole situation. The fact of the matter is the whole world is watching the USA right now and all we hear is that you keep children in cages without basic necessities. Frankly we don't really care which one of your two major parties started the circus, but neither of them seem to be ending it in order to not make their party look like the weaker one that has to compromises. In your crazy entanglement of political games you've lost your humanity and if your first response is "The opposition did it too" and not "we need to stop this now" then you are no closer to fixing the problem, just at a stalemate between two political parties playing hot potato.
All of you seem to be more concerned by the atrocities the opposition is committing rather than the atrocities you, as a country, are committing.
And if your first response to this is: "But there are countries out there that do the same, or worse" then you've learned nothing. The USA is supposed to be the greatest country in the world. Well you can't hold that title if you hold yourselves at standards set by less great countries.

It has been proven that through social engineering a vote can be swayed so that it doesn't reflect the will of the people. Brexit is the best example: by bombarding the anti brexit voters with polls showing a massive margine, thus convincing them there is no need to go to vote and by showing small loosing margins to the pro-brexit folk, convincing them to vote, you've ensured victory. In order to do that, you need as much information on an individual as you can to make your target propaganda as effective as possible. 
Payments through Facebook will give them a lot of information like what you've baught, when, for how much so they can deduce even more about you as a person and how to better manipulate you. Hence why it's the sound of democracy dying. I agree that it's a bit fringy, but that's what it is

... really... did he even do a basic google search on the subject of quantum computers before making that post?
*Though a functional quantum computer of the necessary size to crack RSA encryption is still far off in the future, the threat that such a computer poses still resonates among digital security experts. In January, the U.S. National Security Agency posted a FAQ on the risks.*
*“I think people are starting to get freaked out about it,” Green says. “They still think it's anywhere from 15 to 30 years away but data can last a very long time. The good news is most of the data we had doesn't have to be kept secure for 30 years, but some of it does.”*

Crypto throws a spanner in the works of this plan big time. The talker doesn't understand it, but bitcoin is more similar to cash thank to electronic money in the sense that it can't be controlled by anyone else apart from the owner, and it can't be affected by a central point of "control".
The issue that we face right now, in my opinion, is that early adopters and institutions have started hoarding bitcoin for either personal wealth or to remove it from circulation, which means there will be very little to no bitcoin for other people to buy. Yes this will make it very ",valuable" but also useless in terms of being a currency.

No, they drive them up by creating a lot of transactions at different fees. For example I just create two wallet addresses and send bitcoin between them at different fees. The amount of bitcoin I'm sending is irrelevant, all I care about is the fee I'm paying for these transactions to occur. In the end they are operating at a loss because they are constantly paying the transactions, but by doing so the queue of transactions gets bigger and bigger. 
On a general basis, the transactions with higher fees get processed first, so if they create enough spam transactions at different price points they ultimately force people who have to do real transactions to pay more than the fake transactions cost in order to get their transfer across.
Why do this to begin with? Surely it is really expensive to constantly dump money into transactions. Two reasons:
Either to make the network unusable in order to promote block size increase or make the network unusable so people loose trust in it and ultimately stop using it, which would make banks incredibly happy.

I don't think that's a correct assumption mainly because the mt. Gox incident put a massive break in bitcoin's adoption that shouldn't have been there. Think of it like the dark ages of bitcoin. If that whole madness didn't happen, the price wouldn't have gone back down to 200$.
If you want to average growth rate the last two years are a much better timeframe. In Dec 2015 the price was $360.
Which puts the growth rate at 15.5% per month.
This one year from now we should be at 64k. 
The thing is to, if you average only the last year instead of the last two, the growth rate is 25.7%. So the growth rate has drastically increased in the last two months. That is insane! If we are to extrapolate this as well, we'd get to 177k by the end of the year
 That's mad! Let's do it!

Let me be perfectly clear: I am not saying that lazy people do not exist. I am not saying that possibilities for bettering yourself and your lifestyle don't exist, and neither am I saying that people that are just expecting everything to be handed to them don't exist.
What I am saying, and I'm confident I've made it abundantly clear, is that I'm sick and tired of hearing the BS story that all millennials are lazy and they have it so easy.
Funny enough, most people on this subreddit, myself included and yourself as well as pursuing a vision of a better world, and while we all probably don't share the same exact vision we definitely are pursuing a betterment. 
But by the media shaming a generation of people, born in circumstances wildly different than their predecessors, into technologies that previous generations didn't have or need, calling them lazy, calling them entitled, demoralizing them and not sympathizing with them and their problems is completely not the way to go.
It makes my skin crawl to hear this narrative over and over again, how millennials are this and that. I'm a millennial, I have millennial friends, we all worked our asses off to get to where we are. I don't have to work so much because I wasn't scared of moving boxes in a warehouse until my coding degree kicked in, and then I wasn't scared to negotiate my salary up with companies that were trying to pull a fast one on me. However that is me, that is not everyone, and while all of these kids are trying to figure out how to make a living, the media and every other generation before it is calling them the worst generation. That is fucking depressing. 
In the UK, the misses and I, both highly paid individuals in our late 20's (and by highly paid I mean we're top 15% of the wealthiest individuals in the UK individually, put together and with no kids our income is what you'd consider solid) we would struggle to afford a 1 bedroom apartment, and that apartment would still be 20-40 miles away from our respective jobs. I ask you, do you think this is normal?
Yes, I'm angry, a lot of us are, but this anger exists due to an arrogance and lack of understanding from every generation coming before us that instead of trying to listen and understand the problems we face, they just try to impose their views and reasoning on us. And when it doesn't work, "they're just lazy and entitled"

WOW this website is cancer. 
Besides having the perfect scam-site design (mismatching art styles, using the wrong social media icons, using the wrong fonts, red text on blue background) they just scream scammy:
"Qbit requires about 50% less power to mine than Bitcoin and alt coins. X11 significantly lowers electricity costs. It also keeps GPUs over 30% cooler making graphic cards less prone to overheating. This will make Qbit X11 a favorite."
This one phrase has soo many things wrong with it I don't even know where to begin. Nah mate, this is not how shit works, hardware works at the speed/power you set it to, and depending on that you determine how fast / how much work it does, not the other way arround.

Okay okay okay, fine, I'll bite. Let's assume, like you said, that inflation is completely necessity to keep the economy alive otherwise people will just hoard indefinitely despite having needs for goods and services, including luxury ones.
Why is it then that the system is designed in such a way that is almost uneconomically sound for an individual to store wealth while financial institutions actually benefit heavily from doing so?
As an individual I can only lend my money to a bank and at best receive 5% APR for it on a yearly basis (and that's the best case scenario). Me, giving my money to the bank enables them to not only store my money, but actually make a copy of 90% of it that they just pull out of thin air and lend it forward to someone else at an APR of 17.5% or more! 
In this inflationary system that was created by the banks and the bankers, that we are told that the economy would collapse of it was deflationary, somehow everyone else that is not a bank looses money, while the bank gets to gain money as well as store other people's money which is the exact thing their system is trying to incentivise us not to do!
Seriously, institution makes and applies a system in which only they benefit directly from and then tells everyone else it has to be this way otherwise doom and gloom.

@_date: 2017-12-16 06:04:33
I concede to the fact that I jumped the gun on the APR thinking exclusively of credit cards. I agree. 
However, I haven't found a single loan where a bank actually has the interest rate bellow the inflation rate, while most accounts you open with a bank have the interest rate bellow the inflation rate, some even providing no interest rate at all, not that at 0.05% on a current account really matters anymore.
Second, access to the 3% interest rate loans is only allowed for specific individuals to purchase specific things, so not everybody's money is the same. In contras, in first world countries it is almost impossible to even get a monthly salary without going through a bank. So almost everyone is forced to give them money almost interest free, while not many have the possibility of getting a loan with an interest rate that's close to inflation levels.

If I have 0.0001BTC I can send it back and forth between TenX and Bitstamp till I'm blue in the face. Then when my TenX card comes in I can finally buy some beer with it in my area as well, since nobody accepts bitcoin around here.
Segwit+TransactionBatching is a good enough solution for now, until LN and other options become available. It's just a matter of using something that works for you. 
So right now, there are options, it's just a bit of a pain in the but to find them. But if you really want to use a crypto NOW that doesn't have this problem, IOTA's there for you. 
I really believe in bitcoin, I believe that these problems will be fixed going forward, and if I'm wrong, another coin will more than definitely step up and pick up the slack.
TL;DR: Yes you can use it, there are ways to use it, you just have to be open to them instead of wishful thinking.

Oh yey you missed out on some fiat. Great! So did I, so did a lot of people. Actually so did pretty much everyone appart from a few individuals. So what?
"Oh but I would have been debt free" you would have been a fucking fool. If you sold off your bitcoin to pay your debts in full and have nothing left then what? Then you'd be in the same exact position as now with a lesser fiat debt. A debt that's going to go away by itself as crypto gets adopted and hyperinflation sets in. Then your debt will be worthless. 
The only people that won in this are the holders. The guys that got some from the beginning and didn't budge an inch. The guys that paid their debts and lost all their bitcoin in 3-4 years time will be right back on here making posts on how they missed out on everything. 
You're going to read about people that have paid close to $300,000,000 for a Lamborghini and if Lamborghini were smart and kept parts of those payments they'll be pissing themselves laughing.

I am quite skeptical of this...
I mean, just as an example, if you have sufficient skin in the game you'd end up running a computer as a mining machine just so that the network doesn't collapse.
Yeah right now it takes crazy asic machines to mine but that's only because the difficulty scales up with the hashing power. At the end, mining for new coins won't be a thing anymore but if you have a lot of bitcoin and want to still be able to use it you probably won't mind having some old PC still running hashes just to keep the network alive. 
People have kept PC's alive for much sillier reasons than having bitcoin survive. Hell, I'm running a full node right now and get absolutely no direct reward out of it, but that's okay, because i get indirect rewards from keeping the currency alive.

~~Yes, it is:~~
~~&gt; segwit is making the blocks bigger~~
~~"Segregated Witness, or SegWit as it is commonly known is where data, or more specifically data related to signatures are removed from bitcoin transactions making them smaller in size. This in turn makes the blocks smaller meaning more transactions can be included in a block." [Source](
~~&gt;  so the limited use [of segwit presumably] is helping the network survive~~
~~Illogical statement. The ability to have more transactions fit in the same space will obviously leave to the mathematical conclusion that the queue of pending transactions (the mem-pool) will clear up faster provided the influx of new transactions stays the same.~~ 
~~If you want to make the argument of "Yes but that will have the effect of more people wanting to conduct transactions due to the increased bandwidth", increasing the block size would have the same exact effect, so you'd end up contradicting yourself.~~ 
I stand corrected by , as always you can't believe everything you read and spreading misinformation on the internet is the norm (i'm not saying the intent was malicious, but the result is not a good one).
I apologize for not documenting myself further, I was ill-informed myself and now I'm reconsidering my position and segwit and blockchain increase. 
However. I BEG YOU users, the ones that have bothered to write explanations to my comment. It is obvious that I'm not the only misinformed one, the votes speak for themselves. If you're limiting to just proving me wrong you've educated just one fool.

It infrastructure to handle the type for volume these exchanges happen is not easy. Also they don't go down when the news hits, they go down in the aftermath of all their users rushing to exchange their stuff all hitting the infrastructure at the same time.
Also hosting is not cheap, especially for something this big and responsive. It has to calculate all the transactions happening at any one second between multiple currencies and make sure this is all happening withing a allocated time frame. This is also software all written by people that have probably never had to deal with this type of data and volume before. 
It's like asking why Teslas break down so much compared to other cars in the same price range. Because the company doesn't have the 100 years experience of VW or Ford.
Also do consider these exchanges are open 24/7 with no maintenance downtime, unlike every other market out there.
I know it's easy to get angry when you want to sell/buy at the absolute peak and the system freezes, but it's part of the risk.
That being said: the support team not answering customer tickets, especially ones on delayed/missing wallet transactions is just unacceptable. Writing a complex it system is hard, providing a daily update on a situation is not....

Screw bitcoin, why would you have to pay so much for an engagement of any kind. 25k on a ring? Are you mad?
Mate get her an engagement car? engagement mortgage deposit? Just give her the cash? Seriously any single thing you choose to do with that money would be better than buying that ring, bitcoin included.
My wife told me that if I went up to her and proposed with any sort of diamond ring, or any ring that was more than $1000, she would have either straight up rejected me due to my complete lack of financial sense, or sold the ring and baught herself a car.
I obviously do not know your final situation, maybe you're like a multi milionaire in which sense sure 25k ring doesn't seem like so much but it's still a perverse amount to spend on something so pointless. But if you're middle-class and your gf is middle-class DO NOT make such a stupid purchase. 
25k would have paid off my UK student loan twice over and still have enough left for a ring. Do not waste that money on a diamond, it is dumb as hell

Auch, bad example. Public education is fucked in most countries and not many people are going to care for that. Try police , fire department, public health, people care for those.
And how to pay for them? Well VAT exists in the uk, and the US also applies tax on purchased goods, that can be increased and now those services are dependent on consumers purchasing products rather than their income. 
I truly believe that being taxted based your income is bullshit. It becomes much more justifiable to tax based on item necessity. Say food has a 1-2% tax, regulae cars have a 5-10% tax because they are not strictly necessary but not an absolute luxary. However a supercar like a Lamborghini should be taxed maybe 40-50% since it's nothing more than a dick measuring tool.

They take over the subreddit even though they are BCH, they take over bitcoin.com, and one of their major public faces flies off the handle if people call it something else other than Bitcoin Cash. BCash is in no way insulting, so he given the above they have two roads they can go down:
1. They can either be seen as a obsessed rogue group bent on imposing their views and will on everyone else (like a terrorist organisation)
2. Or be seen as con artists trying to steal the brand and reputation of a much bigger product.
The problem is, both of these scenarios are equally bad so there is no way they can get out of this on top.

No! Stop! I'm sick of hearing this BS over and over, it's enough!


We are not talking about medieval times, we are talking about 50 years ago at most!


Agreed, however, it's not the subject of the conversation.


That is not at all what OP is saying. OP says it will disrupt the system, he in no way implies it will change and fix everything. This is a strawman attempt


Agreed, but again, not the point of the thread.


At present time, all people have access to the same exact luxuries regardless of age so they benefit from technological advancements in equal doses.
We are equivalating purchasing power and standard of living between Millenials and Baby Boomers at the same age and the fact of the matter is, a boomer family could live off of the income of a low to mid-tjob, which is no longer the case anymore. Technological advancements, while very nice and all, have nothing to do with the fact that millennials get paid a lot less for the same amount of work that a baby boomer would do when they were of the same age. 


Yes, because working in a McDonalds back in the kitchen for minimum wage is miles better isn't it? Inhaling grease and burnt chemicals all day, surrounded by sweat and stressful conditions.
Not to mention the fact that now, companies have realized that it's much more economically sound to have a high turn-over of people than to keep old ones on-board because it keeps employment costs down. Don't have to give raises, don't have to provide benefits, don't have to reward loyalty or high effort, It's GREAT!
You know what all of that translates to? Stress, poverty, uncertainty, depression and eventually suicide.


Imigrations regulations are just as strict now as they've always been, and even if you get around them you are still faced with language and culture bariers, racism, sexim and a slew of other bariers. Transportation has improved, relocation has not become easier in any way, it's actually become harder as housing and rent prices go up due to the increased travel possibility.


This just screams ignorance! There are so many people that have been burned trying to do this. So many people of varying ages that have been destroyed by their own lack of talent or even worse, by YouTube not giving a crap and changing a policy that absolutely decimated their channels. Do you even know why Pateron exists? It's because YouTube revenues have become so bad that the individuals making a living out of their channels were quickly heading to bankruptcy due to the payments getting smaller and smaller. It's only due to the generosity of OTHER FREAKING MILLENNIALS that they didn't have to go back to 0.


No argument here, this is probably true


And we're back to the bullshit! No, they are not! Just because you see a few that have chosen this path in the news, that's not many, that's still a few. They have the possibility to do this, but most people still love to come home to their nice little corner and relax away from the responsibilities of the outside world. Most of us still face the very harsh reality of bills ownership and the like from 50 years ago. Well apart from the house ownership, most of us can't afford those...


 
That mantra specifically relates to "Don't buy people or yourself material shit, buy yourselves experiences and travel" because going on a one week trip to Hawaii is a lot more interesting than owning a bloody iPhone X. It has nothing to do with the desire of owning practical things like a house or a car. 
Also, AirBnB is expensive mate, a lot more expensive than rent or a mortgage on a house that we can't afford anyway! AirBnB is just a hotel replacement because it provides better value for money, it doesn't just magically resolve the housing crisis. 


No! Fuck no! I'm extending an olive branch to my family, my parents, as they have done their absolute best to raise me and take care of me and provide me with a good life. They made savings despite the inflationary currencies, they didn't buy 3 houses and 4 cars that they didn't need on credit. For every other person that has these insane views that millennials have it so much better, I have absolutely no fucking simpathy.


Oh, and it will have it. Maybe not Bitcoin, maybe not Ethereum, maybe not any of the currencies that have been already invented. But one of them will get everyone onboard. It's up to everyone to decide how much they want to put their ignorance and fear aside and jump in early while they still can. 
My recommendation to you, stop watching the news and go work in a Fast-Food, Retail or Services job for 6 months, tell us how you feel after that.

and are very correct but they are not very good at explaining the situation so let me try and help out.
Have you ever heard of brothers fighting over an inheritance? Married people breaking up over a financial decision? How about spouses murdering each other to claim insurance? 
Of course, there is absolutely no reason why this should or would happen to you and your friend. You've probably known each other forever and never in your life have had an argument over a toy? a crush? a videogame? 
Are you able to say for sure that you will get along for the rest of your lives and always be perfectly in accordance on what to do with this invested money? Remember that people bet half their shit that they're going to love someone for the rest of their life and that burns to ashes a lot more often than we like to think about.
And finally, even if despite all of the above you are lucky enough that you never have an argument, what's the harm in having two separate wallets, one with your money, one with his money, you manage both but also give him a copy of the credentials to his wallet so in case the unthinkable happens, you don't owe anyone anything?

@_date: 2017-12-16 05:27:24
This... This perfectly outlines how ridiculous the whole thing is. 
Say you have 10000 fiat, that fiat can right now buy you 10000 turnips. Your interest rate means that in a year you will have 10005 fiat. But inflation means it's total value has gone down by 1.88%. So you can now only buy 9816 turnips. 
Now think if you were a bank doing the same identical thing. A bank puts it's money (which is not it's money, it's somebody else's but this is not the time for that) into their savings account they have open with you, but the interest rate you provide them is 17.5%, because that's what the APR on a loan is! (Yes only when they give you money to use it's called a loan, if you give them money to use it's called savings)
With the same 10000 fiat, in a year they can buy 11529 turnips. 
Banks get richer, you go hungry, because all of sudden turnips are more expensive yet the bank can buy more of them the cheeky bastards.

This is a fair question and the answer is, it would probably be okay from a technological stand point. Current blockchain size is 150ish GB. With a 1MB block size we are creating 51.5GB of data every year so increasing to 2MB would double that number for every year going into the future. Thus, a 1TB hdd would sort you out for about 9 years worth of storage which is not too bad.
The problem I think, right now, is more of a political nature. We already have a technology that helps a lot with this issue, it's called segwit, which from my experience, whenever I did a segwit transfer between wallets it was fast and cheap. However big exchanges are refusing to adopt it because... They say there's no demand for if from the users. Most of the transfers clogging up the blockchain are generated by these exchanges so at this point you have to ask yourself why implement a risky fork-generating solution just because some individuals with a lot of power are resisting consensus. 
So yeah, increasing the block size even though there is a perfectly usable solution already implemented just not adopted by major players would be a step toward succumbing to manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:48:44
..... I don't even know if you're being sarcastic or taking me for a fool. Of course it's smaller it's not having to store as many transactions per block since not as many people are using it. What kind of argument is this?

Sorry to burst your bubble guys but right now it's probably more like 1994-1997 era. We don't have to buy bitcoins from individuals on the street and we don't only have the option of a command line interface for our node/wallet. We're a bit further down the wire than that.
In the mid 90's the web browser revolution started and the world wide web became a thing. People started to adopt the internet mainstream and some basic easy to use tools became available. This is bitcoin now, we have some neat tools and services but everything is kind of half baked. We'll now probably be entering a period of explosive growth, attempted take-overs and all sorts of other madness. 
The main difference between bitcoin and the internet adoption is that the internet didn't really have direct competitors on a massive scale. Bitcoin has over 1000, a lot of them shitty, some of them really popular and potentially better. But its not always the best technology that wins , isn't that right betamax? 
We will now have entire ecosystems and services built on top of bitcoin, some good , and some not so good , and all of this will culminate in a potential crash at the end due to overhype followed by a rebirth and a steady rise to seemlessness, just like how the internet is seamless now and exists everywhere at any time for everyone (sorry n Korea and Egypt, and to some extent China)

Can I please urge everyone to first of all not do this, and second of all not spread this advice of "don't follow it".
Bitcoin and a lot of other cryptos are free open-source platforms. They exist and propagate purely because regular people and organizations decide to and have an interest in adopting and propagating the platform.
If we all just invested in it and forgot about it, the price would go down to 0 instantly, as nobody would care for it, nobody would promote it and thus adoption would stop.
I'm not saying obsess about the price, that's dumb, obsess about the tech and the news. Create yourself something related to crypto, or create something for somebody else. Here are some examples:
- Become a Core dev! The project is on GitHub and ANYONE can contribute 
- Run a full node! It is fun. [Mine is here](
- Read a book on how the blockchain works and how to create your own crypto.
- Run a newsletter like our friends at [coinsheet](
- Or a funny website like [Bitcoin Obituaries]( The damn thing died 217 times!
There are so many things you can do, that anyone can do. Just do something, anything that you think might be fun. Even if it's of shit quality, because if you keep doing it, you'll get better :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:01:48
Look I'm all for the bitcoin hype train as well. The plan is working, it's gaining value and every single challenge and hurdle is being overcome by patient engineers and researchers. We should all support that!
But if it ever were to turn out that bitcoin itself was not the answer, there are several hundred other implementations of cryptocurrency and many more still to be made. One of them will most probably have the correct answer.
Cryptocurrency is an inevitable future, we just have to stay smart and keep it decentralised and out of the hands of fucknuggets

@_date: 2017-12-16 08:18:03
I think the problem with increasing the block size now is more of a political problem than a technological one.
You're a dev, how many times have you heard of sales asking to put in this "Quick Feature" or "quick change", etc. Then how many times was that a good idea? And it doesn't stop there, because fi you do it once "You've done it before, why can't you do it this time too". It quickly spirals out of control.
Furthermore, increasing the blcok size now would be admitting that BCH was right. That could very quickly turn into BCH is the real Bitcoin and end up with them using their social engineering skills to do a shift of brand. They already took hold of bitcoin.com and so that would further confuse things.
Personally I'm not a big fan of increasing the block size either. I hate the prospect of making the blockchain generate data any faster than it already is. I'm trying to spin up a tiny Full Node and it's been syncing for days. If the blocks were 8 times the size I wouldn't even bother, and probably many others wouldn't as well and that's really bad.
Having said all that, if Bitcoin itself fucks up and cripples its own adoption due to lack of transaction speed, there are plenty of valid cryptos out there to take its place, and that's fine with me

I doubt that many people here hate banks for occasional math errors if they occur. Even I have a banking service I really like due to their low fees and amazing response times, but that's not the point.
People hate the banking system, as a whole (well... I say people, but I honestly can only speak for myself and a few select others that I know hold the same opinion as me). I don't hate that bank A has a lower interest rate than bank B, I hate that all banks have an interest rate that's lower than inflation while they charge me an interest rate higher than inflation for providing them with the same exact service.
I am in no way denying that each individual bank is a business and are is in it for the profit, it's the sum of all of them and the methods by which they operate that is the problem. They don't compete, they monopolize, and then pay off politicians to shut up. The financial crash that happened in 2007-2008, that didn't happen because of one bank, that happened because of ALL of them and because they are so big and powerful, nobody actually experienced any sort of punishment for the aftermath.
Look, I sound like an idealistic nut, but it's really easy to hide behind the numbers and the interest rates and say that it's not so bad when you're middle-class in a first world country, can afford a house with a low-interest rate and so on. 
But that is, unfortunately, a dying minority of people. Go ask the Greek how they felt a few years back when they went to their banks to get out grocery money and they were told by the ATM, in a very polite fashion, to piss off. Go ask a kid what he thinks about the 3% interest rate on a mortgage when his 50k student loan is sitting there gathering interest and he can't get a graduate job straight out of Uni because they require at least 2 years experience. And I'm not talking about some BS liberal arts degree, I'm talking engineering, programming, phisycs.

Can you go into detail on this point for me because I don't really understand?
If the price has an upwards tendency, why not just long and ride it upwards instead of trying to force a short? Wouldn't it just be easier to rake in the profits from it increasing instead of forcing it to drop in value while shorting it? 
I don't understand why go through the trouble when you can just ride the wave...

Ahhh well you see, you can be taxed on the value that it has gained since you came into its possession. Let's say I buy 1 bitcoin right now, it's worth $11700, cool. Next tax year, it will be worth $50,000. Even though I haven't cashed out, one of my tradable assets has gained almost $40000. However, this asset, because it's a currency of sorts, I can exchange it for services and goods directly and if I have enough of it I may not even need to work.
All of a sudden, the government stops receiving income tax although i did technically make an income. That's unacceptable in the eyes of a govt for its population, so they'll just say "cool, in this case, we're going to instead tax you on the profit you've made over the last tax year, however we will not give you fuck all if you made a loss, that's your problem and we want no part of it"
~Oh but they'd never do that, it would cause an uproar~
Aha, if my house had solar panels on it, and I made an income because I'd bee feeding power to the grid, I'd get taxed on that income, if I'm using power from the grid, I pay Value Added Tax. Whether you make money or spend money, fuck you you get taxed.

To be completely honest with you, I enjoy this sub a lot. It represents a sample of how the bitcoin market thinks and behaves as a unit as well as what bitcoin means to various people.
If people are here trying to get rich quick, I don't mind it much, most of them end up loosing their money and the others that are successful at it, good for them. This all means that there is enough interest and trust in BTC to even attempt it, legitimising it.
I mean how many people buy apple stocks because they believe in apple Vs because they're trying to make money. It's all part of mass adoption, and that's fine.
And if you spend enough time, you find meaningful discussion as well. But yeah I also totally understand how this might annoy you if you think it's being taken over by people who don't see it's true meaning and value. I just think of it as "you need to not understand it before you start to kind of get it and see its value"

This will be the reality for quite a lot while longer due to a few unfortunate factors:
1. People that have a lot to loose from the rise of bitcoin (top wealth bankers, government, the associated media of these institutions) will continue to discredit it as it directly threatens their world order. If something was threating my way of life the way bitcoin is threatening theirs I'd be panacking and pissed off too. The best analogy I can give is the current UK government and the EU: they constantly blame the EU for every shitty outcome even though it's their own fault for opposing the future.
2. People that wanted to get in but didn't due to FUD. There are a lot of individuals that dismissed bitcoin publicly from the begining and now going back on their word means they are wrong. It takes a really big man/woman to fess up to they mistakes and sometimes it's just easier to stick to the narrative even tho is wrong.
3. People that want to get in but can't due to social pressure. Their spouse, parent, guardian, etc. Is a part of groups 1 or 2 and as such won't allow them to buy in as it would destroy their pride. I'm sure there are plenty in this scenario
4. Financial shortcomings: you'd like some but you have no extra income to invest, so instead of admitting the harsh reality you lable it as stupid.
5. You just read the wrong mainstream media that constantly parrots how bad bitcoin is on behalf of group 1. So you just parrot them in turn without doing any research.
People will convert over time... But for now this is still a shit show
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:24:15
I have no problem with this. Really, it's fine people are drawn in for the gains bit. If bitcoin works as a currency, it will naturally transition into one as more people decide they want to use it as such. 
Right now it doesn't deserve to be a currency due to high transaction fees, slow processing and horrible processing queues. They will be fixed by LN and it will become easier to exchange your stuffs. 
But to be truly addopted as currency, it needs an app easy enough to use that my Dad can figure it out and it needs to be accepted in more large chain stores.
Think about it, if it were easy to pay with bitcoin, all you have to do is tell people "put your whole salary into bitcoin at the begining of the month, and it will gain value thought the month, meaning you have more purchasing power than you would have in fiat".
Some people are very against service like TenX and Monaco, saying that It undermined the point of bitcoin. I think they are an amazing opportunity to enable people to use bitcon day to day and make the transition smoother.

WARNING: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, THIS IS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT.
If you take out a loan for $12000 at an APR of 10% (this is a real expensive loan) and Bitcoin persists at its average growth rate over the last 9 years of its existence (12% per month) you've made the money to pay back the loan plus profit within a month.
But fuck that! Here's something better:
If all the crazy preachers like Andreas turn out to be right, and this thing brings down the world economy, having none will turn out to be a really bad decision.

Unfortunately they still haven't released a patch since release which is pretty bad, but I blame this solely on square Enix cause they only car about the bottom line. People baught it, who cares if they're happy or not. If the refund count doesn't go above a certain threshold they won't move a finger to fix anything.

It's still not equivalent, but let's be honest, in the 1960s the low-end job of choice wasn't coal mining.

Scared that their spouse will think less of them due to their investment. Depending on the investment , the spouse could be either correct or unreasonable. In either case, if you can't trust them to support you, you probably shouldn't be together.
If you don't trust your spouse because they're not being reasonable, you shouldn't be together. If they're not trusting you because you are reckless and have a proven track record of poor decisions, they shouldn't be with you. 
There's no winning! Well unless you trust each other, that's obviously winning. 
I couldn't imagine doing any sort of investment without discussing it with the misses first to see what she thinks. Similarly she would never ever stop me if it's just my personal money I'm investing. If it's more than just my money, then it has to be a common decision. Easy!

Replace the word millennials with hippies in this sentence (and remove the word iPhone) and you have the same exact rant from 60 years ago. There is nothing lazier about this generation than there was about every single generation before it.


I really don't see how the two are related, at all...


Nah I'm pretty aware of all the child labor that went into my clothes, as well as the underpaid labor that went into making the computer I'm typing from. Millenials do not refer to the 20-30 yo's that live in America or the Uk. It refers to all of us, including my 3rd world country skipping ass. The guys working in factories in China for little to no pay, a lot of them are millennials. 
But all you're seeing is your poor choice in companionship. Stop living in your own bubble and go talk to other people your age. Very feew millenials are actually waste of space, you just need better friends.

I know dude, and it sucks, but until I or somebody else comes up with a better plan this is what we have.
Here's one final piece of advice, it's not very good advice mind you but it's the best I've got anyway...


In the end, each and every individual is free to live their life as they choose, even if it's objectively the wrong way to live it. You can share your views (for now anyway) to anyone willing to listen, but if they don't listen, they don't listen, there's nothing you can do about it. 
The faith of the world is not your fault, or mine because we're tying despite knowing that we will most probably fail. But that's okay, cause there's nothing else to do. 
I guess the best way to summarise it is "Help your fellow man if they're willing to help themselves"
You're a good person, I hope you have a happy life. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:09:51
I'm with you on this one. It sounds overly optimistic but the attention bitcoin has been gaining recently and the news that's been comming out about futures and stuff like that is in no way being well represented by a 200 billion market cap. That number is way too small.
If the public had been mostly responsible for getting bitcoin up to that market cap, institutionalised fiat will have a much more significant impact on it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:15:04
Example: 
One, or multiple individuals have decided to sell a massive amount of stock (in this case bitcoin) at a specific price. (17250)
The graphical representation of this, as you can see, looks like a wall. In order for the wall to be "eaten" the buyers need to keep buying bitcoin at 17250 until all the coins at that price are sold.
The problem is, as most people want the price to go up, the wall stops the price from growing as it takes a while to sell that large amount of bitcoin.
With a wall big enough, and the right conditions, you could even make the traders panic and start selling, thinking there is no way that wall is getting breached, and the price trend starts reversing.
If a wall, especially of this size, gets eaten up quickly, it means that the growth of the currency is really strong. One of the easiest ways for such a wall to disappear is when you have regular people that don't care for graphs or stock trading buy in mass, as they will buy at any price without looking. 
Another way to quickly get rid of it is to have one person that wants A LOT OF BITCOIN, NOW!

Since that election every single promise to the winning camp has been broken, the government lost its majority and has done some border-line illegal stuff to remain in power, most of the polls say that people regret their decision and want another vote on whether or not to leave brexit, the country is falling apart because of with Scotland losing all of its patience and N. Ireland being more a part of Ireland than the United Kingdom post-brexit.

The system doesn't care if you have .0001BTC or 1000BTC, you are equal in its eyers.
You yourself have to make sure the service you are about to use for any reason is legit and not a scam. There is no phishing filter, there is only your judgement.

- someone else adopts a pet without fully understanding or commuting to the needs of that pet. Then it dies...
- some people have kids out of the following reasons: to "save" their marriage, to avoid paying a tax, to save them from boredom. And then you get varying degrees of neglected children
- some people buy bitcoin thinking it's a get rich scheme, but only a few can be truly rich. You only get to be truly rich if bitcoin becomes an actual world currency, anything less can be good for your future, but not for the rest of your life.

Hey, thanks for the kind words, it's really appreciated.


This is another funny bit. Bitcoin is supposed to bank the unbanked, help the poor and provide them equal services, however, if you can't afford to buy bitcoin now, even though you really believe in the technology, you're not going to benefit at all. 
Think of Satoshi, he made this amazing system, which is great and we really like it, but he also carved out himself a nice slice of almost 5% of the total value of bitcoin on the planet. So if bitcoin ever reaches the value of gold (7 trillion dallards), he carved himself out a cool 350 billion. 
It doesn't feel so much like a spread of wealth as it feels like a redistribution of it so we could say that right now, the people responsible behind crypto are trying to make their lives better while fucking over the previous and the next generations.
I believe in crypto and the fact that it may bring down the banking system, I really really do, I just question the actual motives behind it as it feels we're just creating a new/different class of super-elites. But of course I have no proof for this, it's just skepticism, for all i know Satoshi could just turn around and give those 1 million bitcoins away. 
But yeah, In current time, as a working-class of any generation, you're only option if you want to get on the crypto band-wagon is to either force yourself into more debt or cut some significant lifestyle luxuries (like a mobile phone subscription) to save up, which in my opinions are not really options. The poor stay poor, the rich get richer. We've achieved next to nothing so far.
But enough of me being a nillist, how's your day going?
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:40:58
One thing people don't seem to understand is that markets are:
1. Not individual singular entities, they can be influenced heavily by external factors including other markets, price manipulation, global economy status, local economy status, etc. 
2. Markets do have memory, especially now in the technology age. That graph you posted , if it was ever true, everyone knows of it and everyone is trying to figure out how to leverage it towards their interest. The more people try to play it, the more it changes. 
Any event in trading is recorded, studied and strategies are developed around it on how to handle such situations, a lot of the times competing strategies, so posting a graph example that had existed forever is pretty much pointless

Hahahhahaha What are they high? Mate if I can prove that something was in my possession, which with bitcoin is really easy mind you, because the transactions are public and all I have to do is follow them on the blockchain, and then I can prove that a transaction left from my wallet to someone else's without me doing it (which may be more difficult depending on the circumstance, easier if I can show I wasn't at my computer at the time of transfer) then it's stealing and you going to jail.

I am so sick of reading this nonsense! Learn how a decentralised network works for fucks sake!!! 
You can't just delete the leger out of existence any more than you can delete the internet out of existence. It exists on every single computer that wants to participate, you'd have to get rid of all of them at the same time to make it go away and it HAS to be at the same time, because if done gradually it can just replicate somewhere else.
Then there's the fact that it's bank made money that suffer from this more than bitcoin does because it's centrally controlled. They want your savings gone? It takes the push of a button on your bank account and you can't do shit to stop it, because it's not your money to own! And what's even sadder is that this already has happened in Greece but most people are so busy keeping up with the fucking Kardashians they can't see the world around them crumbling.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:22:11
Inflationary currencies how now existed for hundreds of years. The Central Bank of England was formed in 1694 and with it came the slow but stable creation of inflationary currency. 
Over the years the supporters of this type of currency have been popularising the idea that debt is necessary to incentivize growth, that if it wasn't this way people wouldn't want to work because their money would work for them depending on the level of wealth they have. 
They also promoted the idea that if a currency was deflationary like you said, it would incentivize hoarding instead of spending which could halt the economy. 
But let's think about each and every one of these points: It's 2030 (maybe, I don't know). Fiat currency has stopped, the government has died or not (it's irrelevant) but we're all living in a deflationary world. Let's see how this affects us
- Deflationary currency reduces spending. 
This point is most probably true, but reduces is not the same as eliminates. Right now, I'm sure you agree there is an issue with people taking out loans for things they can't afford and thus generating an ever-growing hole of debt. How many people do you know driving cars that are well outside of their purchasing power? I personally know individuals that pay obscene amounts of rent just so they can say that they live in London, even though they don't need to live there. 
Having a deflationary currency will probably contribute to less spending, but this can also lead to fewer people living outside of their means and in a better financial situation. 
Furthermore, most people will still need a car, they will still need a computer, a phone, a train ticket. They'll just stop buying a new iPhone every year since consumerism is out of control anyway. 
Is reducing spending at this point really a bad thing. 
- Discourages loans
Most probably, but why is this a bad thing exactly? When have you seen an individual happy that they had to get a loan? How many times have you seen people trapped in endless loan repayments?
It is thought of, for example, that giving people access to mortgages enables them to buy a home when they otherwise couldn't. But what it actually did was increase the housing prices to such unbelievable heights that now you need to be enslaved to interest for decades in order to get a small apartment. More demand, same supply, the price goes up to curb demand, easy. 
Loans benefit exactly two things, and nothing more: Rasining prices and making bankers money through interest. THAT IS IT.
- Decreases employment
Yeaaaaahhh nooo whaaaat? Money is still not going to magically appear into existence for 90% of the population. People still need to eat and live, and still, need to earn a living. 
If anything, if individuals didn't have to worry so much about putting food on the table they'd have more time to explore their passions and earn a living through that. Humans get bored really quickly, and most of them will go out and find something to do that generates some kind of value. 
Yes people do like being lazy, but laziness comes from the need of doing things they don't want to do in order to maintain themselves. Some are lazier than other, but it's not due to a deflationary or inflationary currency.
- hinders investments
How? Investors, by definition, want to make more money out of their current money at the risk of losing it. They'll look at a potential investment and think "What would make me more dinner, giving this company 1 BTC or keeping my 1 BTC" and they'll do an analysis and decide for or against, just like they do now. The only difference is now they go the extra step of thinking "Hedgefund or investment". 
Hell, people are so greedy that RIGHT NOW, with bitcoin growing exponentially, they still go and try to day trade the crypto market to make an even bigger profit. This is all within the realm of hyperdeflationary currencies. 
- slows economic growth
I'm assuming this is a summarization of the points above? As it's a very broad statement.
- Is this not well established?
Not at all, there has never been an un-temparable, un-counterfitable, decentralized, public-owned currency in history. There are no studies, no examples, nothing to say how this will work with any kind of degree of certainty. 
However what we DO know at the moment is that an inflationary system every now and again grinds to a halt and requires a few sacrifices (people's homes, wealth, etc) to get back up and running again, all the while the people causing these issues don't ever get punished because they have the ability and power to freeze the whole system and take the world economy down with them.
- What am I missing? 
The propaganda aspect of it. Who's been spreading these ideas through history, that an inflationary system is the best we have? Would that deflation cause the economy to halt? 
And probably, most importantly, who stands to gain from an inflationary currency (a select few) over a deflationary currency (most people).
Conversed :)

I'd like to share one reason that I like bitcoin that's much smaller than the grand design "take down the system" ambitions that it has.
Bitcoin helped me, and many others, to give up on our vices. When you think about smoking as a $300 lump of money that could be replicating itself instead of going up in literal smoke, quitting is not so bad. Then because you baught bitcoin you also start reading about it, and you replace your fag brakes with reading bitcoin sub breaks.
Overall, there have been quite a few people that are going to live much longer and healthier lives because of bitcoin. And I think that's just fantastic!

HELL most people don't really understand what money is to begin with!

Yeah but ROI over time in this case. They buy now, they get out when they want to short it and they gain money over that period of time through the futures, then they buy back in and gain money over time by riding the wave up again unless they've completely fucked up and bitcoin never recovers.
However if the just buy in now and not short, price continues up on its merry way, they still make a profit without risking irreversibly damaging the value of it because of the panic over the same ammount of time. 
The only thing I do not know for sure is if they stand to make more money by shorting or by waiting, but one of these two strategies cold permanently damage their income stream. 
Hence why i'm so confused on the matter.
It sounds to me more like they are trying to irreversibly cripple bitcoin so it looses all public interest.

The beauty of bitcoin is that, in extreme circumstances you could make transactions using pretty much anything as long as you have the private key to your wallet. Hell if you set up a bitcoin node ready to receive request via HAM radio you could do it even like that.

I like having conversations, thanks for replying :)


Lower in what way is the question. If your currency is deflationary, the number will be lower but you have more value per unit. The GDP of the Rep. of Moldova in 2011 was $7B. Bitcoin at the time was around $1 so that's 7B bitcoin. Moldova's GDP in 2017 is $6.75B, expressed in bitcoin at the begging of 2017 it was 6.75Million BTC. You could say Moldova's GDP has gone down 1000 times but that's only because the value of the currency you're measuring it in went up 1000 times.
Now of course, if the money you have is gaining value over time you're less inclined to spend it. But think of spending habits right now: What would you skimp out on if your money stood to increase value. Would you not buy a mobile phone? Would you not buy a car? Would you not buy food. Yes spending would go down but for what exactly? Basic necessities or pointless spending? Everybody needs a phone, nobody needs a new phone every single year. Everybody needs a car, nobody needs three. In my opinion (and this is an opinion, I have fuck all to back this with) if spending would go down, manufacturers would be forced to actually provide proper advancements in order for someone to be parted with their money.
Think about a $1000 iPhone X, an $800 Samsung 8 and a $300 dollar LG V20. You are paying a $500 premium for what's essentially just a slightly prettier design, and another $200 on top of that if you want it made by Apple. ALL THESE DEVICES DO THE SAME THING, and all of them do it within a very small difference of quality. Hell, right now they are putting out software updates over the air to slow down the older generation of tech to further push people into buying the newer versions, even though their older versions would have worked fine otherwise. 
The downsides of overspending right now are so big on a global scale (planned obsolescence, increased debt, lack of knowledge in managing finance) and all the money and power is concentrated in just fewer and fewer people, it's probably time to try the alternative and see what happens.


The whole point of this argument (i'm not saying it's your argument, just the basis behind this thinking) hinges on one very important factor: Companies are incapable of adapting to new economic situations, which is complete and utter ballax as they have to do this every single day, on a global scale, in very diverse jurisdictions with very diverse laws. Companies are not these poor defenceless entities that need to be protected and loved, they are highly adaptable sociopaths that can survive in varying conditions. People will continue to have needs and companies will continue to cater to those needs. Furthermore, they are doing job-cutting any way by automating as many positions as possible to increase profit, just profit, revenue is nice too, but the lower the running costs the better. Regardless of crypto or not, this jobless future is still arriving for a totally different reason. Deflationary currency is just a poster child to try to fabricate another argument against it. 


I really don't see how. For example, you invest in gold, you invest in a Deflationary System. It has existed forever but regular people have usually been gated away from it due to a high barrier of entry. That doesn't stop investors from using it, and they still make investment decisions towards funding companies and business.


I think our discussion may have just sparked something. We're both looking at the extremes: Full deflationary vs full inflationary systems but there is absolutely NOTHING that says they both can't co-exist. Right now gold exists, and it's a deflationary system, with cash existing along-side it. Now crypto exists, which is another deflationary system but unlike gold, this one does not have a barrier to entry, everyone can participate. Most probably what will end up happening is both systems will exist in parallel with people and entities jumping between the two in order to meet their needs. I don't know, it's a possibility.
The beauty lies in the fact that because the new deflationary system is not enforced, but willingly adopted into use, if there is a problem with it, reversion to the old system will happen naturally. The only people that will suffer during such periods are the ones that unreasonably hang on to one or the other instead of adapting.
I think this is why, whenever I see someone makes absolute predictions about anything it makes my back hair spike. So I say, we won't know unless we try it :D
Good chat!

Ughhh what's the point... It's a free internet you can do whatever you want wherever.

I've used bitstamp twice now. You can buy with CC, and bank transfers, they support Segwit. I think they accept americans too although they do not take American Express, just Visa or MasterCard and it has to be a 3D secure card. 
CC fees were reasonable-ish.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:43:15
Excellent! Now you are making sense! This I understand.
Look I'm trying to not be the pessimist I usually am. Truth be told I expect all of this to end in a bloodbath that's coming fairly soon. Whether it's people starving on the streets cause nobody cares about them on a massive scale (not the small scale that we have right now) or they come together and start a bloody revolution I don't know. 
Revolutions out of hunger and poverty have existed before. All you need is to look at every country in the former Soviet bloc, however even there conspiracies formed that the revolutions came out of government manipulation of some kind. 
I do know one thing tho, the truth is irrelevant. It's only what people believe that matters, Donold Trump proved that beyond any reason of a doubt by becoming president. He convinced a huge mass of people that him, with his insane wealth, is on the poor people's said. 
So maybe if he can shout bullshit so much and it turning to "truth", then instead of panicking about a future that I can't stop, I choose to believe and propagate the intention of crypto and decentralization and what they stand for. That's how I'm working towards a better future. 
A lot of people, especially on these crypto subs, know the realist future we are heading to and, the problem is by acknowledging it and promoting that direction we are solidifying its own inception.

For quick and dirty transactions I use TenX. You don't hold the private key, thus it's not your wallet so do not store in there what you can't afford to use. They plan on becoming decentralized and open source in the future, which means having access to your own private key as well but until then it ain't yours.
For higher values, I actually have my own bitcoin core node and when I will have too much value to feel comfortable with on my computer I'll purchase myself a trezor.
The only tricky bit is exchanges. I'm still trying to find one in Europe or the UK that uses segwit and accepts cards alongside bank account transfers.

I admit this is a concern I have as well when it comes to the displacement of bitcoin ownership. 
However, there are two things that allow me to sleep at night:
1. One of these wealthy fuckers wouldn't decide to convert all of their wealth all at once back to fiat because it would hurt them as well to drive the price down so fast. Keeping their wealth well managed and let it trickle out slowly means they stay super wealthy and the market is happy. Now we're just left with the problem that we've swapped one set of rich cunts for another. 
2. Other cryptos exist! I know that everyone on this sub sees bitcoin as the end all game but there are other perfectly usable coins out there, some more technologically advanced so diversifying is a good strategy. Yeah a bitcoin crash caused by point 1 will most definitely drag Alts down as well but it won't kill them completely. Hell a crash wouldn't probably kill bitcoin completely either.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:15:05
Full disclosure, I don't think it's either the best or the one that will prevail in the end. There is too much drama llama and too many parties trying to manipulate it in one way or another. Technology-wise it's okay and fits the bill but it is the first version and by far it's not the best.
However it wouldn't be the first time and inferior technology won due to various outside factors. 
At this point in time, I don't really mind or care which one of them wins. They all have cool things about them and winning is all relative. 
We'll have a crypto for storage (potentially bitcoin), a crypto for spending (IOTA maybe?) A crypto for programmable money (perhaps ETH) and that's really swell I think.
Trying to make one crypto to fit all needs can be a bad idea. Diversity is good!

Look if it makes you feel better, We've probably seen the worst of it now. 
My honest opinion is that it's going to touch 10,500 and start climbing. Mainly because that's what's consistent with every other dip in the past 7 dips. On a log chart, it always stops 17% higher than the value projected by the previous two dips.

Okay. Word of advice with regards to retreiving the BC's of the card. DO NOT USE A WINDOWS MACHINE. Ideally install a fresh version of Ubuntu on something and the first thing you do is  make a backup of that  stick in multiple trusted locations. Say one on the hard drive and one on another two sticks. That card looks old and you don't want it burning at any point. If you have another similar card it would be wise to test the reader with the similar card to make sure it's not broken before attempting to extract any information form the main card.
Once you have a few backups of the wallet on a safe machine you can start looking into extracting the funds. If it's just 10BTC (hehe just 200k) buy a hardware wallet and move stuff to it. If it's more you might want to think about multiple wallets and spreading out the wealth. 
If you need more help on how to do any of this feel free to ask and I'll be happy to answer. I don't want more BTC being lost forever...
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:42:15
I think you are really not considering the implications of reverting to material store of value. 
It's heavy to transport and manage, it deteriorates over time, it's easy to steal and countries will start waging war over it in order to own some. Backing a fiat currency with it is also problematic as then you have to have a government or a bank holding on to most of it which brings back the whole centralisation of power and control over the population.
Bitcoin is not without its flaws, cryptocurrency of any kind has its flaws, but it's a method of value store that does not depend on anything other than the free market in order to exist.
As for your solar flair example, we'd have significantly bigger issues to deal with than a financial collapse if that were to happen. Every single part of society would instantly stop working, some very poorly stored nuclear warheads in the Ukrainian may detonate, all transport for any kind will freeze and all communications will stop on a global scale. The fact that my money won't be available to me anymore will count for nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:02:58
What you say in theory is true and it makes sense, and in an idealistic world would probably be even correct. But, unfortunately we don't live in an idealistic world. Communism in an idealistic world is the best form of governance: everyone is the same, everyone has access to all that they need at any time, everyone is equal and everyone is happy. But we know that is just not the case because in communism all the power is centralised without any form of accountability.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. There is no denying that, and right now the reality is that the wealthy have access to deflationary goods and investments that the general population just can't afford, so we're left with a situation where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And first world countries are still allright, countries like the Rep of Moldova for example are just demorolising to see.
I know that it sort of makes sense to have an inflationary economy in theory, but let's challenge that theory anyway and see what happens.

Adopting is not the same thing as using. They are making steps towards it, doesn't mean they are there yet. 
Yes, I've heard the fees argument so much in the past few weeks it's making my head spin. It's just as true now as it was a month ago but as of yet, it hasn't significantly hindered progress in terms of adoption. 
Yes, I'd like bitcoin to be cheaply transferable as well. I myself am using only segwit wallets, am spinning up a node with segwit support and when the lightning network comes out I'll see what I can do to support that too. 
Solutions exist, some are already here but not being adopted because... I don't know ask Coinbase. Others are still in the works and the results on the test net are really impressive.
If you are about to say about increasing the block size, please understand that this point has been analyzed, discussed, dissected and put to rest. Bitcoin, the original bitcoin, has already chosen a path to follow. People that disagreed with this path have migrated to other currencies or made their own forks, which I think is a perfectly intelligent response to the situation.

[Here's a start]( . The process is a little more complicated for US citizens than it is for EEA nationals.
The level of tolerance they'll have for Bitcoin users is directly proportional to how hard they fuck up Brexit. The more removed the UK becomes from the EU, the more tolerant they will probably be due to the need for inflow of wealth of some kind. This, of course, could result in it becoming really expensive to live in the UK.
If they make nice with the EU, then it will probably mean that they will have to subject to EU and pressures in some form or another. Then it becomes a question of how tolerant is the EU towards crypto.

Going and telling people "THE END IS NEAR" will make me sound like a religious nut. That's not useful, nobody likes that, nobody cares to believe or accept that. 
I know that the government is going to try and control it, package it neatly and tell me how shiny it is with its regulation and its ballax, and I'll be right here spouting my bit at decentralization and taking back some control PEACEFULLY. Because even though I pretty much know it's going to end in a bloodbath, I also hold out hope that I'm wrong, and will act according to that.

In the UK, Wales voted overwhelmingly that they support Brexit and want out of the EU and the commons market without realising that most of their income, infrastructure and development came out of EU funds, as England does not give a rat's ass about or the rest of the kingdom.
This situation only became apparent to them now, mid-way through the leaving processes and they are faced with the reality that they might loose their funding for pretty much everything.
This was not a secret meeting developed by smart and wealthy bankers behind closed doors. This was all out in the open for everyone to see and THEY WERE TOLD this would happen, but all they wanted was to ban immigrants.
Are you really that supprised that nobody cares about what the FED is doing to the world? Most people don't care about global warming, modern-day slavery. They don't care that their cheap H&amp;M clothes were made by child labour in dangerous and unhealthy conditions. 
[They don't care that there are more empty house than there are homelsess people]( This is actually an amazing example that shows how free market economics are flawed in some aspects. Free market economics are amazing for luxury items like smartphones and laptops etc. But if it's a basic necesity like shelter, food, water they would rather hold out the supply and not lower the price beceause they know they can eventually get more money for the product, since it's a necesity. 
Nobody gives a crap about fuck all unless it affects them.
In the US, [50% of the produce created is wasted because it's not purchased by anyone]( America produces twice the ammount of food that they need and throw it away!!! the US could feed their homeless, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Columbia and Canada with their wasted food!
No, people don't care, all they care about is their own well being, and that's what makes Bitcoin so fucking amazing. A developer, or group of developers, by accident or on purpose, has managed to rally a world that doesn't care to unwillingly care about something with no detriment to themselves (at least, no detriment that we can observe right now) and I think that is at least Genious.

10 years down the line is going to be a very stressful time. This thing will definitely fuck banks up and will probably take down a few governments in the process as well. World order changes of this magnitude usually end up in blood , especially if they happen suddenly so we'll need to find some nice places to chill untill the crazy blows over. 
For example, if the UK government asks me to pay income tax on the income I receive from holding bitcoin, like I would have to for owning any other stock or bond that's fine. If they try to tax me more specifically because it's bitcoin I'll just grab ma shit and move.

You're joking... The computers capable of doing this back then, capable of connecting to the ARPANET and communicating with each-other were insanely expensive. Universities, researchers and the military had insane amounts of money invested in making this tech work. 
Instead of financial, business or government entities being invested, now you have regular joes that do it. Yes a lot of them are doing it because they think it'll get them rich quick, and that my happen or it might not. How exactly is that the fault of the technology?

Potentially unpopular opinion: I'm loving the bitcoin bull-bear cycles.
After going through a proper crash and after you've been in the space long enough that you learn not to obsessively look at the chart every 5 minutes, Bitcoin as a technology, community and trend become a lot more fun to follow.
It's really hard to get to this point, it took me 2 years to be honest, but once you're there it's super pleasant. I trust bitcoin to succeed in the long run so I buy a little every month, regardless of the price. I then have the pleasure to see how my investment does (well or poorly) overall. I go on every day to see what the latest news is about, kind of how you'd read the paper every day and participate in a conversation or two.

@_date: 2019-06-25 10:20:49
Uh this is a fun thread! I want to chip in too. What I'm doing is very simple, but clasifying it seems to be difficult. I really hope and believe Bitcoin or some other form of crypto will be the future of money. Right now bitcoin has the highest chance so obviously I'm here rooting for it. So I'm trying to accumulate bitcoin by doing the following:
\- Spend fiat I absolutely don't need to acquire bitcoin ( instead of buying cigarettes, or sweets which are bad for me, i'll just get a little bitcoin instead)  
\- Do a little bit of safe trading on the side to try and increase the amount of BTC I have. Don't think I'm an expert trader or anything, just a little bit of fun and safe trades  
\- Only sell bitcoin for fiat on one condition: If I am 100% sure it's about to have a massive drop after a parabolic rise so I can buy more bitcoin in a few months time.  
\- I am completely fine with bitcoin going to 0 worth. If that happens it means something was wrong with the tech at a fundamental level and that is completely fine. I believe in it until it's unequivocally proven otherwise. 
I truly believe that bitcoin will be the future. People will start using it as a currency more and more as it becomes wide-spread and that means that the more I can manage to acquire now by doing little actions the better off I'll be in my 50's or 60's.
If you're buying bitcoin now thinking you'll be rich in 6 months, 12 months, 24 months that's pretty much gambling. You have better odds than the lottery mind you, but it's still gambling.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:05:38
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:07:52
Okay, I'll bite.
First of all, I fail to understand how you define it as a scam exactly. The definition of a scam is "a dishonest scheme; a fraud". Now in that sense, it means that the creators of bitcoin must benefit at the expense of everyone else. Which means that at some point in the future, somehow the wealth we've all invested is going to transfer from us to them. So far that's 160 billion dollars that are just going to somehow magically go to one or a few individuals. Never mind that from a technological standpoint it incredibly improbable, it would also be very noticable. Calling it a scam is... confusing because it doesn't make sense. It's more of a very high-risk market.
Now onto your points:
1. Bitcoin was intended as a currency, yes, but because it is not controlled by any one individual it is impossible to enforce its role upon itself. Due to some lack of foresight and certain technical decisions as well as the current geopolitical events it turned into/is more used as an investment/storage of wealth. It wouldn't be the first or the last invention that would be used for a totally different purpose than its intended one. 
2. Okay I tride to be polite but this is just crazy flawed. At the point of purchase in that exact time and space 1 item = x ammount in USD = y ammount in bitcoin. Weather you spent the X ammount in USD on the item or the Y ammount in Bitcoin on the item you have spent the same exact ammount at that point in time. The only difference is bitcoin gains value while usd looses value over time because deflationary vs inflationary. You could just as easily say I can buy 1 bitcoin with 10000 USD or 5000 turnips, but why would I buy my bitcoin with turnups since the value of the dolar is going down faster than the value of turnips? I'm just going to keep my turnips and spend my dollars. It's all relative. 
As for the transfer fees, which is a totally different point. These are technological impediments that are actively being worked on.
3. Uhm... wut? What's stopping you from doing fundamental analysis on bitcoin exactly instead of buying into hype? Seriously the code is open source, all the plans and the discussions are out in the open, there is no hidden balance sheet to consider, everyone's thoughts on the tech are publicly available. How exactly are you prohibited from making a buyin/selling decision based on fundamental analysis when it comes to bitcoin. 
Look if you don't belive in the tech that's fine, nothing i say can convince you otherwise. But your arguments make little to no sense...

I don't understand how could he possibly be the soul keeper of that account when you need to stick in the private key every time someone wants to do a withdrawal. I can't fathom the CEO of a company sitting at a desk and manually honouring every single withdrawal request himself because he's the only one that knows the password. I mean there's technological ways to speed that up, say her had a software built that cashed all the requests through the day and then he'd type in the password, all the requests get fulfilled and the the password is erased from that computer's memory but still, it seems incredibly unlikely.

I don't think this is clear enough so let me elaborate. The current rules and patterns for trading were developed on a slow-moving old stock market and they do not translate well at all into the new world. It takes a very skilled and open minded individual to play the crypto market successfully.

UUUUU GUESTIMATES! I love playing this game!
In the last year it has grown each month anywere between -7% to 63%. On average it has pulled a growth of 22% per month.
So let's assume that this will continue (it most definately won't, it's most likely going to accelerate and then slow down, or just accelerate and slow down next year).
1 Month: 12,600
3 Months: 18,800
1 Year: 113,000
5 Years: This one is tricky/risky . While i'm confident bitcoin is still going to go strong next year, i doubt it will cotinue to be the dominator for the next 5 years. Its inherit technological problems may cause it to eventually be overtaken by something else. Competition from governments starting their own cryptos, all the other coins in circulation, maybe some new tech that disrupts this one. It's very hard to say if this trend will continue. 
I will however go ahead and say this: At some point before 2020, 1 BTC will be worth $1,000,000 even if it's just for a second.

Holly cow, that paragraph alone is enough to give you an aneurysm. I know there are a lot of people floating around that don't understand all of this so I really want to break it down for y'all:


The value of any object is determined by the market, that's how capitalism works gizmodo... You should know this, you are a business...


This is just objectively false, as this subreddit shows every day. Adoptions by shops and restaurants for accepting bitcoin as payment has been growing constantly. ATMs are more and more frequent. Spend five minutes on this sub and you'll see how false this statement is.


Energy is expended it in order to create it, therefore it's backed by the energy invested in order for it to exist. God damn Gizmodo this is simple stuff common you're literally making this argument yourselves. Furthermore, the power requirement comes from the fact that a lot of people are competing to be the next block generator that gets the block reward. If less people would be interested in mining bitcoin, the power consumption would go down but the network will still run at the same exact speed. 


This is completely false for the same reason I mentioned above. It's not bitcoin that needs more processing power, its humans competing for the reward that creates the supply of more processing power. 


I know this one will be hard to swallow Gizmodo, but so does your company since I can only assume you didn't write this article on paper and then printed it in The Daily Express, although that's where it belongs, and if we're to compare value produced per CO2 emissions generated, I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is more useful than your whole damn enterprise, especially since you write pointless, unresearched, sensationalist bull you pass for opinion pieces like this one!

The above posted by OP is the 7-day trends chart and we can see some increased activity over the last few days, which is great but if we look at the [30 day chart]( it's not really much interested. There is a tiny growth but it's not above the general interest in the last month. 
Then if you look at the [90 day chart]( it's not noticeable in any way. 
I'm not saying that this couldn't be the start of the next bull, I am saying that we should wait for more confirmation and look at charts over a longer time-frame before getting to excited. 
Anyway, it's good to see some movement in the space as it was getting a bit too quiet. 
Ah yes and remember kids, NEVER tell someone how much bitcoin you own. [The $5 wrench hack]( is super effective against bitcoin and there's not much devs can do to fix it.

A few problems with using exact numbers. First of all, they vary depending on the exact change you are getting ticker data from, so making statements like this won't apply unless you tell me what market you did your analysis on. This will be less impactful here as it is a Day chart and the variations are quite small. 
Second, assuming that we are using the same market (Bitfinex), you are telling me the downtrend should be extrapolated based on the High price of 17-12-2017 and the Closing price of 05-03-2018. This makes no sense, you either use the high price of both dates or the highest between the opening and closing price of both days.  
But all of the above I disagree with as you should never do your trading based on exact price values, as they vary depending on the exchange you're doing your analysis on. You should always consider an acceptable range and fault tolerance when establishing your lines.


This indeed could be, but again on my chart, it looks like for the first two you're using the high value of the respective days, and then the closing value of the last day. 
But for me to worry about this as being a new resistance line I want to see the old one broken first.

 Willy Woo shared what you expect for Bitcoin in the short term
Renato Shirakashi and the founder of Woobull.com, the crypto money analyst Willy Woo, presented different opinions on what he expects for the BTC in the short term, according to his statements on Twitter and Medium. In addition, crypto money analysts decided whether the BTC / USD parity had set a ayı dip Ayrıca in the bear market.
Earlier this month, the BTC / USD parity rose to $ 4,000 before seeing the decline supported. BTC, the leading crypto currency in press time, has been trading at around $ 3,584 since December 18th.
 Shirakashi states that there is a dip level in Bitcoin
Shirakashi, a pro-Ascension, voiced doubts over warnings previously issued by traders such as Tone Vays. As Cripto Koin reported earlier, Tone Vays correctly predicted the BTC price drop from $ 3,000 to $ 3,500, believing the BTC / USD parity could reach $ 1,300 or lower.
. Murad Mahmudov, David Puell, Willy Woo, Tone Vaysa ’respects and disagrees with Bitcoin. Various technical indicators, including those developed by Murad Mahmudov and David Puell, supported this view.
 ��
 Was the dipco level seen in Bitcoin?
At the same time, Willy Woo focused on non-chain volatility, suggesting that BTC could still continue. The analyst said less volatility is a prerequisite for the price increase. Willy Woo adds:


According to the analyst's preliminary results, the volume of the crypto currency, which is now very irregular, must be stabilized in order to find the bottom level. Technical arguments reflect the analyst's wide-ranging view this year. Last week, Civic CEO Vinny Lingham said that BTC thought it would be under $ 5,000 for a month or two before deciding to make a decisive move, while other crypto money would see 2019 the highest price of all time.


*In the bottom of the bear detox. (In this chart I'm tracking the volatility of on-chain volume).* [*pic.twitter.com/avyı1ortxh*](  
*– Willy Woo ( [*January 14, 2019*](
 ”BTC will be traded in the range of $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 for a long time.“
Shirakashi also expects a small period of activity before it grows and adds:

If someone cloned you, and your clone was running on the streets saying they are the REAL and TRUE you because they are closer to the real you's vision (whatever that is) it's still scamming, because they are not you. They are not the same mater that you are so they are not you. 
Yes we can get into a massive philosophical discussion about the REAL you but the fact of the matter is, it's a clone, it's not the original, therefore selling it as the original is a scam. Same as BCH.

OKAY, guys can we try a little harder not to sound like lunatics and fanatics? Christ...
Hi OP, what everyone is trying to say is that [bitcoin.com]( is a domain that was bought by a guy who made a Crypto identical to Bitcoin (BTC) called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). BCH is a fork from bitcoin made by this individual and his associates because they thought that BTC was moving away from Satoshi's vision. 
This group, in their belief that they are the true bitcoin, has taken over by force the subreddit, bought the rights to the [bitcoin.com]( domain name and at some point also managed to take hold of the  twitter handle to try and promote his currency BCH. This is why everyone refers to the one dude as a scammer. You need to decide for yourself if what everyone says is true or not.
There have been other unscrupulous thing that the BCH community have done in order to try and appropriate the Bitcoin image, but they have ultimately failed.
What we on need to get through our thick skulls is that if we start making hard enthusiastic fanatical claims, we are going to drive new users away...

Nope! Not at all. The technology exists to support it and allow it to grow, it's not inhibited by that. If it fails from a popular standpoint, eventually an iteration of this tech will succeed. 
Stuff that's ahead of its time fails only because the technological environment it needs to succeed in. Electric cars were invented in the late 1800s along petrol cars, but due to the lack of any proper battery technology they failed. Smartphones existed way before the iPhone in the form of PDAs, but it took the invention of a new kind of simplified interface and app experience to allow for their worldwide adoption.
The important thing is that it was invented, and it's very obvious that it's not failing, but we're asking of it to replace banks which have existed as a concept and technology for thousands of years, it will be a painfully slow process.

Only when something better comes along. If something better than bitcoin comes along the transition will be natural. All you have to do to not get caught out is to follow the trend.
If for example all of a sudden ETH overtakes BTC as the nr 1 market share crypto, maybe you should be owning some, even if you like bitcoin better. 
It's smart to have your fingers dipped in about 75% of the top market cap. If something comes along in that top, just buy some of it. 
There's nor reason to fear progress. I love Bitcoin but it does have limitations, maybe they'll be fixed, maybe they won't, just stay level-headed and follow the trend.

Because you say so? Because Donald Trump says so? Because Hilary Clinton says so? What's the basis for you claim mate?!?!?!


Probably but again, no reasoning at all... Just "Government doesn't care for you, and will create inflation". That's all fine and dandy mate but inflation has existed for as long as money has been unlinked from gold so you need to also specify WHY it's a problem NOW


Interest rates will continue to rise, making loans a shittier deal but you don't usually invest loaned money, you invest money you already have IF you have it so loans and interest rates increasing don't really help or hinder crypto gold and silver performance. It's not really related at all.
Think of it like this, if you're looking for a loan (because you want to buy a house, a car, a new PS4) how exactly would any of the assets mentioned above help you reach your goal if inflation goes up.
Trick question, it won't.


First of all, debt and credit in this sense are the same thing... Whether you are getting a loan for a specific amount, or you ask a bank to pay for your stuff and you'll give them the money back later, it's the same end result. Second, this is just a rehash of point 2.


The country is run by these people I don't like therefore these 3 assets will outperform all others. Slow clap moment right there...

You've got quite a few critics on that chart hehe.  
My problem with these charts is that they are kind of self-fulfilling prophecies that rely on the lack of knowledge of new investors. So the reason bitcoin kind of respects a pattern is that every time there's a new bull run, new people come and invest blindly while the experienced traders "The smart money" follow the same pattern they've identified in the past. Which is great (albeit a little immoral) until there are no more new investors to join the movement. When there are no more new investors, bull runs stop and that chart stops working.   
Basically, it works because it's a new market, and it will most probably work towards our own benefit, up until the point when it suddenly won't and what scares me is that I do not know where that point is. Is it tomorrow or in 2030 like OP says? I don't know

@_date: 2019-01-14 07:49:32
Well you have to go on the assumption that bitcoin itself is going to be the crypto that succeeds. sure it looks like that now and I personally hope it continues to be the case as I really like it, but it's no guarantee that bitcoin is "The One"
Now going on that assumption there are a few key benefits bitcoin has over other forms of value exchange:
1. It's international. I can send money to anyone at any time as long as they know how to use it for a fixed tiny fee. I don't rely on PayPal or bank transfers to buy 2 kg of chocolate from a farmer in Africa. We're not quite there yet as they need a phone of some kind as well to make it work but that's a technological hurdle not a imposed legal and financial one.
2. It's anonymous, or better said it can be anonymous. While it's true that transactions in bitcoin can be traced back as far as needed and can be traced back to you through the KYC process, all you have to do is buy bitcoin, shapeshift it to monero, send it around a bit, shift it back and stick it in a bitcoin address not tired to you. I think shapeshift started doing KYC as well but if I recall correctly decentralised conversation platforms are becoming a thing so good luck implementing KYC in that.
3. It's un-seizable. Nobody can seize your assets without your consent. Sure if they catch you and torture you they can force consent out of you to divulge your private keys but they can't get to your bitcoin without involving you, the owner in some way. Banks safety deposit boxes can be raided, accounts can be frozen, so can cards, and your cash can be parted from you by the police, so can gold. Can't do that with bitcoin without the private key.

@_date: 2019-01-03 13:07:00
Because it's a complicated math cycle that keeps you from going back and changing a block in the past without changing every single future block. Just a small explanation before I dive into how the blockchain works: Hashing is the procedure by which you take any data, put it through a mathematical algorithm and get a specific, much shorter code at the end of the algorithm that is unique. The key factor is that due to the nature of the mathematical algorithm you cannot take the hash and convert it back to the original data, because data was lost in the process to get to that code.
Now here's a very simplified method of how that works. You have 5 blocks, each block containing multiple transactions and apart from Block 1 (the very first block), it will also contain the hash code of the previous block. After hashing each block gets the following hash codes.
Block 1 = 32
Block 2 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 1) = 23
Block 3 (which contains transaction and the hashcode of Block 2) = 54
Block 4 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 3) = 43
Block 5 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 4) = 91
Now say that I want to modify a transaction in Block 3 after Block 4 and 5 have already been created. I go and change a transaction in block 3 so it gives me more money but now when block 3 gets hashed, the hashcode is no longer 54, it's 71, because I changed data in that block. Fine and dandy but the problem is Block 4 (which has already been created) knows the hash of Block 3 to be 54, not 71. So for my hack to work I have to change that information in Block 4, which in turn generates a new hash for block 4 which doesn't match what's stored in Block 5. So now I also have to change Block 5, etc.
As such, you cannot modify a past block without having to modify all of the blocks that come after it. This wouldn't be a problem until you realise a hashcode is not a two digit number, but looks something like this "0000000000000000001163964a1c98bc52766d24570a3651002f384851057ab1" and we are not on block 5, but block 556834 at the time of writing.
So you're best bet would be to change a block that was created very recently, like maybe 2 blocks ago. This is where decentralized comes in. There are tens of thousands of computers that contain THE FULL blockchain. Each block, with each transaction and each hashcode, is replicated identically on all of these computers. So if you change just one, all the other computers will ignore it because it's most likely that you're trying to do something funny. So if you want to change a block in the history, besides having to change all the blocks that follow that block so the information is consistent, you also have to do it on 51% of the computers on which the blockchain is replicated AT THE SAME TIME so that the rest of the 49% of the computers believe your version of the blockchain.
So in essence, the truthful answer is YES it can be tempered with, but you need space-time bending technology to be able to actually do it.
EDIT: UUuu, gold, shiny, thank you!

So me justifying that the OS doesn't suit my needs due to its limited operational scope does not sound to you as a logical explanation as why I would prefer other OS'es? Everything I can do on MacOS I can do on a Windows or Linux machine without having to pay a massive premium for the same exact hardware I can get from another manufacturer. How is this not a logical decision?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not denying in any way that I don't hate Apple as a company, I truly do, but I've also owned a Macbook Pro from 2011 to 2015 and an iPad mini from 2016 to 2017. I recognize those specific device's merits. That MBP was as you described it, but the new one is a far cry from it. The iPad was just as limited as I mentioned, but for the then retail price of around $200 it was a fair price to ask for what it did, which was to provide entertainment.
But making statements like:
\&gt; I can understand that. Apple has always required their hardware to run their OS, and I agree that it's not cool. Once they switched to Intel, there's no reason it should be so locked down. I guess I just accept it at this point. I don't feel like it's a deal breaker, but again, subjective opinion. 
Are the exact definition of ignoring an objective fact for preferential treatment. You are of course free to do so, it's your money and preference after all, but you can't really say that my logical argument for picking on product over another is illogical and then turn around and dismiss a logical argument in favour of your own biases.

Thanks for the summary, I saw it with 0 upvotes so I figured it was not worth reading.
Miners have no interest in pulling off a 51% attack for the reasons you've mentioned, however, I think it would devalue the coin insanely fast. This is not like any other asset class when it takes time for everyone to move their assets/money onto an exchange and then sell it and the crash would happen over days.  
I think the second a 51% attack would happen, we'd know instantly about it due to all the monitors that devs have set up and then the selling would begin immediately and in volume, as nobody trusts the platform anymore.
If someone finds an exploit in bitcoin and abuses it, that's the moment this crypto dies instantly and something (potentially more secure) takes its place.

That is a wee bit more complicated, but not by much. This is where wallet public and private keys, come in. I'll try and simplify again all the concepts to make it as clear as possible.
Let's start with Private and Public Keys. This is a encryption (not hashing, encryption means I can obtain the original information from the result)  method that says you can only scramble a message with a specific code, and descramble it with a very different but just as specific code, but you couldn't do the reverse. The scrambling code is called the private key (because it's the key that you keep private, for yourself) and the descramble code is called the public key (that's what you give to the recipient, so they can decode your message and read it). Whoever gets a hold of your public key can read the messages you are sending, but they cannot alter and re-encode the message and then push it forward to pretend they are you, because only the private key that you have can encode the message in the correct way so that it can be read by someone with the public key. This is again, done through some very fancy maths.
Now, back to bitcoin. When you set up a wallet you also tell the blockchain what your public key is, but not your private key, that's only for you to know. When you want to do a transaction with Bob, you're not physically giving the bitcoin to Bob, you're just making a request to the blockchain that you want x amount bitcoin to no longer be in your wallet, but be in Bob's wallet, and in order to Authenticate this request (basically to prove that it is you who made the request) you encrypt the request using the private key, which means the blockchain can decode it using the public key. This essentially means that if your request can be decoded correctly and read, it must be YOU who made the request and not some scummy individual.
Well this prohibits someone from stealing your money, but what's there to stop them from creating two wallets and just saying "I want 1 BTC to go from wallet X to wallet Y" without having any money in wallet X. This is where the beauty of blockchain comes back into play. A wallet is always created with 0 Bitcoin in it because the amount of bitcoin in a wallet is determined by the transactions that it was involved in and nothing else, so in order for it to get bitcoin, it has to be received from another wallet that already has bitcoin in it. If I claim that I want to send 1 BTC from wallet X, the blockchain will be read back all the way to the Block when wallet X was created and determine if wallet X has more than 1 BTC in it by replaying all the transactions that it has been involved in since its creation. If the total value stored in it is more than or equal to 1BTC, then the transaction is valid, if not, transaction rejected GTFO.
So it's basically impossible to counterfeit bitcoin.
The only exception to the above is when a new bitcoin is created by a Miner as a result of mining. When miners mine, and a block is discovered that contains a reward, it automatically assigns that reward to a wallet when writing the new block (usually their own, because they like money :) but there have been instances in the past where someone goofed, didn't assign the newly found bitcoin to a correct address and that bitcoin was lost FOREVAAAAA). It still appears as a transaction in their wallet, but the source of the bitcoin will be a block instead of a different wallet. 
So in short, you can't modify past blocks because it requires bending time and space, and you can't modify current blocks because it requires breaking into other people's wallets.
Cracking the private-public key encryption is... well there are some theories that it can be done with quantum super-computing but that's still to be proven and not everyone has access to a quantum super-computer, so your best bet is to beat the living shit out of someone until they give you their private key, or hack into a miner's computer so they send new bitcoin they mine to your wallet instead of their own.

Ah okay so that's more of a question of "Why are people afraid of exchanges".
Exchanges are susceptible to hacking as MtGox and others have proved in the past, so if a hacker manages to infiltrate an exchange and get access to its wallet, basically he can steal everyone's money.
Second, since exchanges actually store your bitcoin in their wallet, you rely on them to give you your bitcoin back. But if they want to close their withdrawal system and not give it to you, there's nothing you can do about it. This is the same thing banks can do these days with your bank account. In both situations, you can sue them (bank or exchange) but that's a lengthy, expensive and tedious process that will prolong you not having access to your bitcoin.
So, instead, you just keep your bitcoin in your own private wallet and none of those risks apply to you anymore. When you're ready to sell, you transfer the amount you want to sell to the exchange (which takes 10-30 minutes) and sell it. 
The only people who can't do this are traders, because they want to trade so they need to have some money on the exchange on a constant basis, but all profits can easily be lifted and moved to a private wallet at the end of the day/week.

What? [This is your chart from your other comment]( I have clearly outlined with arrows the high and the open/close for both days on your initial downtrend line on the log chart. 
You are clearly picking the high in one case, and the close in the second day which is way below the high price of that day. It is not consistent.
You are doing the same for the second trend line where you pick the high point in two touches and the open price for the third one, the high point being above your trend line.

@_date: 2019-01-04 01:11:55
Right so that's a lot of money I personally don't have, but you're asking to be convinced so here's how I see things.
If you think you can buy 100k worth of something and leave it there for 5 years and not care about it, either 100k is nothing to you, which means you can afford to loose it, or you're just simply wrong to think so.
Investment is not a fire and forget deal, that's called a bet, you invest and then constantly monitor and analyze and manage that investment so you stop when you make the desired / expected returns/losses. So in that case you can see if a better crypto emerges and switch your investment to it, or if the losses are to big pull your investment so you don't loose too much thus there is nothing we can say to convince you, it's up to you to do your own research and manage the investment.
So you see, if you start a business, invest in crypto or invest in something else you still have to do work and manage it, it's just up to you to decide what kind of work you like doing and then pursue that.
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:44:19
Ehhhhh Gherghe,
The answer is yes, eventually, if you actually pursue it as a career path and invest most of your time in it.
Can you get rich quick day trading? Fuck no. You'll be lucky to double your money every year. I'm inclined to say all people without exception that come out and say they 100x ed were either incredibly lucky or ar just flat out lying
If they actually were able to do what they said they did, why would they share that? Making YouTube videos eats into their daytrading time and you are suppose be there in the ball every waking minute if the day so there's not Tine for videos. If they ask you for money for their secret, why do they need money? They already have an insanely profits let source of income why do they need another .1 btc from you?
So for most people, investing is a much better idea. Sure it takes longer but it won't keep you up at night as much

It doesn't require a huge amount of foresight to see that if you have an invention that could destabilize the world economy you'd be painting a massive target on your forehead. 
Then if you take into account that that foresight doesn't come from an average Joe, but from an individual or group of individuals that are clever enough to invent bitcoin and all of its intricacies, it's actually not surprising at all. I think it's actually well warranted and predictable. 
Everyone is also saying that OMG he's such an altruist releasing this invention on the world. I'm not so sure he's an altruist. I mean SN has a stash of their own of BTC somewhere, so if it does go big in the long run they are sorted for life. It's very possible that they are already sorted for life. Which is fair enough, that's what we're all trying to do for ourselves.
I just hope for their sake they can remain anonymous for the rest of their existence. The bigger BTC gets, the more enemies they're gonna make, powerful enemies that might not take kindly if the wold's wealth is reshuffled. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 07:11:33
A lot of people like the romanticised anarchist idea of a future without any powerful institutions that loom over them and control their lives.
The reality of the situation is the wealth will shift from one set of individuals and institutions to another. We can stick our heads in the sand screaming "lalala death to banks lalala" but it's already happening. Exchanges are massive holders of bitcoin and the more bitcoin-based services appear (shops, auction websites like ebay, payment processors) and as companies start obtaining bitcoin for their projects (Bakkt, Amazon when they'll decide to accept it as payment, Starbucks as well) bitcoin will slowly be used and controlled through these institutions.
To expect that all these institutions will just sit there and let themselves be trampled over by new tech is just absurd. You don't get to become a massive international business of any kind without learning how to be versatile and adaptable.
This in no way changes the fact that crypto is bringing a new wave of revolution and freedom. It doesn't change the fact that ANYONE can be their own bank, do their own wires, keep their own money secure and use it in the most obscure places on the planet, bringing banking to the rest of the 5-6 billion people who lack these services. That revolution is still there and is still happening and if Bitcoin itself fails to do it, some other crypto will as there is no reason why multiple successful cryptocurrencies can't exist in parallel as they do now. 
As the tech will grow, probably in some far away future when humans relinquish their desire to hold more wealth than other humans then banks will probably disappear or be replaced with some free and open source software that acts as a bank and is easy to use without generating someone huge amounts of profit. Until then, this is a capitalist system and as such is survival of the fittest.

\&gt;  Why exactly would you choose Linux first and Windows second 
They weren't listed in a order of desire to use, just what came to mind first. 
\&gt;  when OSX is basically BSD underneath, and comes with many of the same tools you'd know from Linux? It doesn't make a lot of sense. I understand that opinions are subjective, but they should at least have some sort of logic. 
Linux doesn't come with the requirement of having to run on an Apple-made device. Yes, it is pretty much the same thing, as you said, but I can use it on any device I choose as opposed to os X.
\&gt; I'll be the first to admit Apple charges too much for their hardware. I'd say on average, Apple charges 20% more than they should. 
20% seems conservative to say the least, and I wish it was only about price. Considering their build processes that makes them next to impossible for an individual to repair their own devices at home is a big negative and speaks volumes for their mindset of what device ownership is. 
The recent conundrum with the iPhone is another example of the mistrust I place in their own hardware and software package. I don't want my os to artificially slow down my phone just because Apple thinks that's the best strategy, as obviously, it's the best strategy for them to get consumers to buy a new product. 
You can argue that Samsung does the same, but I don't have a Samsung phone either as I don't like them either or a lot of the same reasons. 
\&gt;  That said, OSX is a fucking excellent OS 
In what way? It only runs on a handful of devices made by 1 manufacturer and a few put-together Hackintoshes. It's certainly more optimized to run better on the devices it is intended to run on, yes, but that still makes it limited in scope. Even the optimization argument fails when you consider the fact that you can make a Linux distro purpose-built for the hardware you need and it will be just as optimized.
Thus, so far, it has significant drawbacks for a power-user. But it's great for a regular user, although a regular user won't care about the efficiency boost gained from having a for-hardware built os.
\&gt;  the Macbook Pro is superior build quality than most laptops and will both last longer *and* hold it's value longer than competitor devices 
That was the case when S. Jobs was alive, not anymore. The newest MacBook Pro, the one with 4 usb-C ports and a touch bar instead of function keys is a flimsy, unsatisfying device that has a horrible feeling keyboard and a form-factor so thin that I'm scared it's going to bend if i put any accidental pressure on it. I'm not even going to go into the overpriced mess that the MacBook is with it's sub 2Ghz dual core CPU.
\&gt; iOS is simply more polished and less vulnerable than Android. Yes, across the board you give up some customization ability, but it's obviously not a big enough deal for the vast majority of people, including developers. There's a reason you see so many Macbooks at dev conferences. 
Yes, and I can get it on exactly 3 models of phones, which I don't like, and are overpriced. I'm literally paying more, to receive less features in a form-factor I don't like, with the promise of "It will run a lot smoother", until they decide to underclock my CPU through a software update of course.
\&gt;  anyone who comes down on the side of 'never Apple' or 'never Windows' or whatever else, are just being closed minded, and don't know enough to understand you need different tools for different jobs. 
Never is a strong word, I'm forced to use their suite of devices every now and again because I have to fulfil a job that requires an Apple device (Like making an iOS app). But if I have an option to not touch them, I'm a lot happier for it.

This is normal, the market was flooded with people looking to make a quick buck and they obviously got whipped out.  It's not even the first time this has happened in the history of bitcoin, nevermind the history of assets, forex or stocks. 
The fundamentals of bitcoin have not failed in any way. Bitcoin hasn't been hacked, it hasn't been compromised in any way, as a technology its perfectly sound.

Chill out, no need to all caps, I can read regular capitalization as well.
I don't think most people want full-on socialism even though they say they do, because full-on socialism is quite an extreme model, just like communism or capitalism. You shouldn't implement any of these models to their full extent as they will end up hurting their people. The United States, for example, is the closest thing to full-on capitalism and you can tell how good that is for their people considering their healthcare costs. 
People right now have reached a point where they want to dial down the capitalism a bit and invest more in some social policies like free healthcare and free education. I don't think most are interested in the workers owning the means of production. But as we say the US, Romania, the UK, Germany and so on are capitalists countries even though they are not exactly full-on capitalist countries because the market is not truly free, we can say similarly about Norway, Sweden etc that they are socialist countries even though they are not full-on socialist. 
The idea is to find a balance that works best for the masses and so far that seems to be working out better in the Nordic countries and their closer to socialism model than in the "capitalist" countries where wealth disparity and inflation is becoming an ever-growing problem.

I don't know if op is going to respond or not, I hope he does, but the main argument against a deflationary currency is people's desire to save it rather than spend it. Economies rely on money circulation in order to function but if everybody thinks they have more to gain by saving their currency instead of spending it, because it will be worth more tomorrow than it is worth today, that will break down the economy as it will lock up.
Basically, why would apple make a new phone to sell to make profit when they can just sit there and do nothing and make a profit because their currency keeps going up in value.
As for my take on the mater: the problem is actually looked at the wrong way around. The reason that the currency is deflationary is because the economy is growing. If the economy doesn't grow, there is nowhere for the currency to gain extra value from and as such nobody gains anything, so we reach the same point as we have now where we have to spend the currency for it to actually be useful, just like we do the dollar.
Secondly, people usually save as much as they need to have a buffer, then spend the rest. You can't take money tot the grave with you and you still need to buy food, clothes, a house etc. The only thing this will probably do is end the era of consumerism where we buy a new piece of shit phone and a new piece of shit car every year to every few years because they are made to last exactly their warranty period and thats it. I can only see that as being a good thing.

This is a saying that I've seen circulating a lot around the Reddit crypto space, being repeated in every thread that tries to justify current market movements with similar movements of the past. 
While not entirely the same, this style of analysis of any kind is often labeled as the gambler's fallacy.
"[The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future. It may also be stated as the belief that, if something happens less frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen more frequently in the future. In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false.](
The key phrase in there is "the outcome being observed is truly random". A coin toss is a reasonably random event. If you get 50 heads in a row, the chances of a next toss being a heads are in no way impacted by the previous 50 results, because a coin lacks memory, preference or opinion. It cannot decide whether it will be more heads or more tails, it's a coin, it will be whatever the outcome decides it will be. 
The reason why this is called gambler's fallacy is not only because it applies to gamblers, but it involves machines or games that should, in theory, always give random outcomes and results. Roulette has 49 blacks, 49 reds, and 2 greens. Your chances of winning if you either bet on black or red are always 49% and provided the table is not rigged you can never expect to have more of a chance than that on any single bet due to past results. A roulette table does not have any preference or decision-making skills, it just does it's spinny-go-roundy motion and that's the end of it.
HOWEVER, a market is not RANDOM, it is CHAOTIC. There is a very big, very important distinction between these two words:
Random - made, done, or happening without method or conscious decision.
Chaotic - the property of a complex system whose behavior is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.
Appearing random, and being random makes a world of difference when you start applying logic to the problem. A nuclear reaction is not Random, it is Chaotic, which means that even though it's complexity is mind-boggling, it's still possible to make computer models that will simulate its behavior given certain conditions and parameters with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 
This then translates very neatly into markets. They are highly chaotic, but they are rational in their irrationality, they have a collective memory and based on past experience they will react a certain way going into the future. Just because it turns out a prediction was wrong, or a trend was broken, that doesn't mean it is Random, that just means your model of it was wrong. 
So please, if you want to justify that 7 bitcoin crashes and recoveries don't mean the 8th will be the same, don't say "past results are not indicative of future performance" because it's completely false. Markets are human-driven and humans have memories, opinions, and emotions which they will act based on with a degree of predictability. Weather that predictability can be reliably assumed is a different story, but that does not make it Random in any way, it makes it Chaotic.

Taranasus's ultimate guide on how to determine if something is a scam:
1. Why is this person offering to make me money? What do they gain from it? If the answer is "nothing" it's a scam.
2. Does the offer sound too good to be true? It's most probably a scam.
3. Could this person make more money by not helping me, a total stranger? It's a scam.
4. Can I find any previous information on this person's social media account (if you're being contacted that way)? If no activity history exists it's 100% a scam.
Take this person that contacted you. She says she can make you money by linking your wallet to her mining operation. It's absolutely free to create wallets, you'd know that because  it cost you nothing to create your own wallet, so wouldn't she create more wallets of her own to make more money? This is an assumption made with absolutely no knowledge of how bitcoin works. If you know how bitcoin works you realize that what she's saying is impossible.
Why would I share this information with random strangers on the internet? Surely I'd much rather share it with my close friends and family so that we can be rich together? But say she wants to be altruistic and share it with strangers, why you? Why not make a blog about it and then whomever wants to partake will partake, why pick you specifically? 
It's not hard to identify a scam.

@_date: 2018-03-28 03:59:50
I want to provide an actual explanation of what the TA'ers are saying because empty claims disgust me and people deserve to take educated conclusions from provided information. 
Thus, [here's the chart]( (a 1Day chart, the big spike is what happened in December), followed by the explanation:
The two dotted green lines at the bottom are called support lines. They form based on places where the price bounced off in the past after falling and then get traced into the future. If the price continues to bounce off a specific line, it gives it more validity. This is called re-testing the support line.
As you can see the price has continuously bounced off the higher support line so far (4 in total), with a 5th re-test happening right now.
You may also note another dotted line that is going downwards. This is called a resistance line, it's a line that the price constantly tries to break through in order to go higher, but does not succeed in doing so. 
Now, as the two lines merge the price will have to eventually break through one of them because that's how the future works. This is where the VooDoo of TA starts showing its head. From past observations of charts in general, if the price breaks through the support it will continue falling until it reaches the next support line. Unfortunately, the next support line as determined by TA is at just over 4K. 
If it breaks through the resistance line, then the price should keep climbing higher according to the already established support line, so happy days, we won't go below 7K. 
As to which way it's going to go? The answer actually is that nobody knows. People can tell you with absolute certainty that they "know" it's going to go up or down based on this or that but the fact of the matter is, it's pure speculation. Some believe it's going to go up because of all the good news, some believe it's going to go down because the trend has been to go down for the past 3 months. You can make a million theories as to why it will go one way or the other but in reality, nobody knows.
So grab a pint, relax, and we shall experience the future in the next 2 weeks.

Pretty much this. Once you've accepted the swings it all becomes very normal. 
It's far more interesting to calmely watch what people do in response to the price does than what the price does in response to god knows what. 
So now we're bellow 10k. How low will it go? 5k? 2k? Who knows but the lower it'll go the more people will be screaming because of it.
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:49:25
A self-fulfilling prophecy. 
In the TA world, [these two lines are about to cross]( They are the 200 day Moving Average and the 50 day Moving Average. What is their relation to the price? Absolutely none at all, but that's not what the traders think. To them, in a textbook somewhere it says that if these two lines cross where the 50 is bellow the 200, it means that the market is in a bearish trend. 
Now depending on how many traders actually trade according to these two lines they might cause a price movement. If there are not that many traders believing in these two lines, then nothing will happen. 
Personally, I'm cheering for the former because I'm bored out of my mind.

The nice thing about bitcoin is the government can't really take it by force from you, like they can any other asset.
There were points in history when it was illegal to directly own gold. In some countries it may still be illegal to directly own gold in its raw form.
Can't do shit about bitcoin. If you have a wallet to which the private key is not written down anywhere and only you have it memorised, the only real course of action is to torture it out of you. 
Someone could probably very easily torture a private key out of me, my threshold for pain is not that great, but at least they can't just come into my house and carry it away like they would gold. 
It's an interesting future we're headin' for

I’ve renounced patriotism long before crypto even existed. Reading even a little into history, economics, politics will basically show how fucked up it is. Hell you can even watch house of cards and reflect on it a bit to realise how fucked up a democratic government is, never mind a dictatorship. 
Block chain and bitcoin are the first technologies to stick their head out and pose a genuine threat to these systems, allowing for the potential of a direct democracy that doesn’t really need a top-down hierarchy to function.
The truly scary thing about direct democracy is that it’s functions as well as its population is educated. I don’t now of the planet is ready for that yet....

You don't have to have one blockchain for all votes on all issues but due to the immutable properties of a blockchain it could be used to store votes on specific laws and regulations and limit the voting capacity of one vote per issue per individual. It's not really that far fetched from a technological stand point.

Dude you have to have yourself a really long think on who the people sharing TA on the internet are. Just ask yourself what would you do in this scenario:
Say you're really good at predicting the market throguh TA, FA, a combination of the two or something completely different. And say you're on the money 80% of the time. By going out on the internet and telling everyone what you think the market will do and being correct you will achieve the following:
1. You'll screw up your own prediction because people will listen to you and react to what you're saying, screwing with the market trend
2. You will grab the attention of banks, �� and other individuals/institutions with a lot of capital that will want to silence you for one reason or another
3. You will be sharing extremely valuable information for free. 
So as you can see, no sane person would dream of sharing their opinions on the web if they knew what they were doing. You'd just lay low and make money and be wealthy and potentially happy. Thus the logical conclusion is that everyone else spewing TA is talking smack.

Well she/they aren't technically wrong on any of their points. Everything they said is 100% true as far as I'm aware but it's what they aren't saying that makes their argument flawd:
- Banks can freeze, seize and/or appropriate your assets at any time for a lot of legit or less legit reasons. This goes for both fiat money and other assets. In case of an all out war they won't really care if it's yours or not, they can appropriate it by force if they have to whatever "it" is. What are they going to do about bitcoin? Short of torturing the private key out of you they can't do squat and that's actually really powerful. 
- thrives and shady individuals can use it. Yeah but thieves and shady individuals use fiat and any other type of asset for their purpose as well so I don't see how this is an argument against crypto. 
- although they don't say it, they are sneakily implying that fiat is more reliable and stable as a store of value which it is, but in a deflationary way. While cryptos value does swing like a monkey on a jet powerd turntable, they are overall deflationary while every fiat coin has been inflationary and some, at times, even hyperinflationery (not really a word but you know what I mean). In its 9 years of existance, overal bitcoin has only gone up on value almost year by year while every other major fist has gone down in value. 
I think the main issue with this video is that it's insulting our intelligence, telling us facts that easily fall over when argued against .

I don't understand exactly how they count. Is it total wallets ever created? Since there is a finite amount of bitcoin in existence wouldn't it make more sense to just count the wallets that have received transaction in the last week/month/year? Then we can at least see active wallets Vs stale wallets. Yes this would exclude some clod storage but eh... 
I need to read up some more on how the protocol works but there should be a way to know to which address these secondary wallet addresses belong to.

It constantly survives it. Last December was by no means a solitary event, it just happened to be the biggest one so far. When BTC reaches 10K again at some point it will trigger another wave of "What? Bitcoin? It's not dead? Oh shit, it went to 3000 then back to 10000? HOLY SHIT IT'S ON NASDAQ NOW? I need to get me some of that! To the moon!!!", that will accelerate it to pass 19k/20k when it will go over its ATH, news will start reporting on it again "BTC not dead, new all-time high" and then we'll get the new wave of people putting their life savings in it and losing everything when it drops.  
Then again, if something truly destabilises the economy, like say, a recession. all bets are off and fuck knows what will hapen. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:55:35
People already explained what happened so there's not point in me saying the same thing again.

Wcex, for example, offers a practice account. Please learn how trading works on that so you don't lose your money by accident. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:05:04
Yeah, dollar cost averaging is what I plan on doing starting this month. I'm educated guessing the bottom is near. The biggest bitcoin "crash", as you said,  was ["November 30, 2013 – January 14, 2015, -87%, 411 Days"]( and we're currently at 81% with this one, so provided it doesn't turn out for this one to be THE BIGGEST crash it should hopefully start gaining ground again.
I just wonder if it will ever break this pattern of supper high growth -&gt; super low drop -&gt; super high growth etc. It's amazing if you're a trader I guess but I just want to invest :(
EDIT: I'm wrong, the biggest crash was 2011-06-10 - 2011-11-21, with a mind-numbing 93% drop. Let's hope it's not the case this time.

Unfortunately I think you're going to have to trickle it out of three little by little. Best idea is to have it split over multiple forms, some as paper some as btc maybe some stil in the bank, some as a different fiat. Managing saving efficiently right now is a nightmare. Makes you think doesn't it... You got all this hard earned money that you can't do anything with because it's technically not yours. Imagine if you had your savings in cash right now and would go to a bank to tell them you want to deposit it all. They would take you out to lunch just so you'd do it.

FUNNY STORY TIME!
Before the time of the lovely lovely bitcoin, this was about 2008? My dad wanted to transform his savings into gold, as in buy a birck of gold or something just because, as any 50yo will tell you, never keep all your honey in the same pot. Here is our experience:
Look at ways to buy gold that can be sold afterwards:
- as jewelery? Too unstable and hard to sell afterwords
- as a birck from the bank?
- from the black market? Illegal, dangerous and can't be sold afterwords
So he decided to go with as a brick from the bank but never went through with it and here's why:
- If you wish to be able to sell it back to the bank you can never take it physically with you. It must always be remain within the "safety" of the bank.
- If you do choose to take it as a brick with you it is impossible to sell it back to the bank, or any bank as they can't "asses it's validity or origin" 
- If you wish to transfer it to a different bank, SURE! For the small fee of... I honestly can't remember what it was but something ludicrous anyway.
So basically they are selling me a very expensive pace of paper that states I own a brick and that I can only sell back to them...
I like what's happening in recent times, especially on reddit but in other places too. People are starting to realize and see how we don't own as individuals anything. Your bank, your government, they own everything and all you have is an illusion of property and value.
Why... I can think of a system a few good years back in which the government owned everything, the people owned nothing and they were all considered equal (with some more equal than others) which collapsed under its own sick and twisted way of manipulating the masses. Now I'm seeing a similar bot more discrete system on the verge of having the same faith...
The Educated are waking up out of their coma and have started making ways to fight back. Let's see what happens shall we? ^.^

He presented his ideea as a sales pitch and not asba descriptive essay which is probably going to lose you some marks. He did not talk about downsides that could lose you some marks too.
