Well, I think you pretty much described it.

Why hate Mt. Gox? Why do people hate the players and try to assign moral blame, instead of look at the system to that gave birth to such uncertainty? 
People have been speculating with this currency for months. That's the true source of instability, not some random organization people have entrusted millions of dollars with. Clearly, Bitcoin hit a massive bubble. Why are people suddenly surprised to find it bursting, like all bubbles do?

Now, if only someone could teach him not to overuse choppy, single-sentence paragraphs.
After a while, they start to grate on the nerves.
It feels like the article is constantly stopping and then starting again.
However, that shouldn't detract from the article's overall message.
Still, Kaminsky could greatly improve his writing style by combining sentences into paragraphs.

No, no, no, you need to create your own Bitcoin universe totally decoupled from reality! I'll buy a unicorn with sprinkles on top for 10 Bitcoin, please! Now, fly me over the rainbow.

I'm with you. I have no stake it the Bitcoin market, but watching how this plays out, and watching people's reactions to it, is really interesting.

That's why the Occupy movement never held much moral traction for me. For many involved, it's simply based upon resentment for the 1%.
You are resentful of something you want but you don't have. I don't resent the rich, because I have little desire to be rich myself.

Can we just accept human behavior and not be so caught up with assigning moral blame? Yes, people are going to speculate to try to make money off of markets.

Yes, but bubbles burst by definition. It was only a matter of time. Are you surprised that people try to gain any edge they possibly can when aggressive speculation is occurring? 
The real problem is that some people who don't have much long-term perspective on investing expected stability in a bubble!
