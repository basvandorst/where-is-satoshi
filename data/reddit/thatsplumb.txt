Mate (Australian use), an object is only valued at what someone wants to pay for it. 
So nobody wants to sell this object at a penny, they think the value is a dollar. But "a million people" have valued at a penny because that is what they are asking to buy it for. It just means that you have over valued that object. 
I can't go to the bank and get a loan out with a 1994 Honda civic as  security and get a $350,000 loan because I value it at that. It would be security on a loan to the value the market is willing to **buy** it at. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:59:04
So why did you need to clarify that people weren't selling the dollar for a penny? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:02:42
Its also not worth a dollar because nobody is buying it for a dollar and doesn't value it as a dollar. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:38:56
OK thanks for the explanation

Monero is pretty private.

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:34:08
Can't be printed? Just fork, everyone make a heap for selling  bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold. Money printed. I am against central banking systems, but that's hypocrisy right there. The feud within bitcoin is toxic and will lead to its downfall

How ever many you need to buy stuff with anonymously mate.

So can you see that the hodling meme is shit. OP took it the wrong way, won't be the only one.
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:24:15
OK then, he didn't lose his coins, but the transactions on lightning need extra steps for a transaction. Make sure you don't buy anything dodgy either.
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:08:23
Don't send too much tho, that guy lost 4btc only 2 weeks ago from memory, closed the channel on him or something. The tech is above my pay grade, but its not as easy as an on chain transaction. Good luck indeed.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:42:33
Surely they would just ban all then? If they are untraceable?
More centralised... Ok
@_date: 2019-11-16 17:29:01
So we are back to monero? Why bother with the middle man
@_date: 2019-11-17 07:20:59
"To be clear, this only affects *remote nodes* (in case the remote node is malicious). Put differently, if you are using your own (local) node, you are unaffected. Furthermore, this particular attack is fixed in v0.15. You can see the relevant commits (and descriptions) here:
In general, I am pleased to see this kind of research, especially if disclosed responsibly (as the authors have done), as it further bolsters Monero's privacy.
EDIT: Section 5.1.3 describes an attack (also fixed in v0.15) that concerns a local node."
one of the guys that always helps out when I have issues as I am a Linux noob. (no you don't have to run monero the way I do, I just try and be even more secure). So yeah, it's like saying, omg this guys bullet proof vest isn't bullet proof at the stitching around his shoulder, while your out there in a rockets Jersey.
@_date: 2019-11-16 23:24:29
It's as anonymous as they get, and the authorities see it as the biggest threat. Judging by the rest of this thread you'd be wise to filter what you listen to.
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:26:31
What monero?
@_date: 2019-11-16 10:12:41
Unfortunately the bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, so they can. Monero however
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:30:35
No I didn't, you just told me, so I am just as gullible either way.
Oh, and don't transact with anyone who has done malicious things either.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:22:27
Yeah, whoops, or take the "with" out, whatever, the point was made I think.
@_date: 2019-11-01 19:03:04
Surely there would need to be a seller? If everyone is holding, there is none to buy, if there arnt transactions why would people mine? If everyone is holding, no-one is trading it for goods and services, therefore it becomes valueless.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:46:04
Hmmm, all those huge mining companies...
"they might be more likely to tolerate it" that is a shit reason to use a tracable form of currency. Please let me use money that you can track my purchases of.
@_date: 2019-11-01 20:18:32
You are able to buy, because people sell tho right?  Yeah people mined when it had no value, that's fair, but they saw a future in it and it wasn't so power intensive. Now, mining is a business, no profits, no miners, that's busines. no transactions block reward. Less miners more chance of 51% attacks, less value as its a risky asset. Holding is bad for bitcoin. Buy it, use it, replenish it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:56:06
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:55:34
Agreed. Unfortunately, "get anonymity", will further the difficulty in using it, just like lighing. They are scared of Monero and ZCash (the private bit) they will just kill on and off ramps. Which means selling things for it / mining it, will be only ways to get it, till they realise there is no stopping crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:56:37
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:17:44

Your not sick of the same shit for years?
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:24:23
People have been hodling kinder egg surprises in lofts somewhere, don't see them coming up in value anytime soon. There are also scarce, not being made anymore (that specific toy), and are being held. If everyone held, it's worthless.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:35:20
There is hardly institutional investment, the market cap is a bees dick compared to current financial instruments.
So these transactions are using it right? Buying and selling (probably gambling) ... So if there was no selling, there wouldn't be much buying, as there wouldn't be much supply.
What incentive to keep machines mining if there is no selling at all? No reward for them, no blocks to mine, as there are no transactions, as everyone is hodling.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:10:43
This picture again, yay!!
@_date: 2019-10-27 08:51:45
If you never sell there is no profit?
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:54:48
Hodl is a dumb phrase. If everyone hodled it kills it. Black and white. Spendl and replenishl

Memes are good, the same ones bad.
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:44:03
Ah yes buy lots you mean 0.0001% if not less of the population...which will get less if nobody USES it, as no1 sees tangible evidence of its existance.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:14:17
But people were using the Internet in 1989, as in trying to. Not just going hey, this works, this could disrupt the world as we know it, better not use it.

Global warming? but its cold today!!
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:00:30
Your right, it's gambling at the moment, so when the holders don't use, No1 else hears about it for its actual use, the gambling dies off as it gets less press as less people are getting into it (what's the point) gamblers leave, tank central.
Use it if you want it to become more worthy, an actual counter to fiat. I think, I read electronic cash somewhere, it was made for using.
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:00:26
True, and its not hodling. Its spendling and replenishling
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:10:20
Fungibility is also a characteristic of sound money, bitcoin doesn't provide it unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:11:12
How many times, hodl doesnt increase value, utility does. If all 21 million bitcoin are mined, and no one wanted to exchange them for goods and services, therefore no-one can sell labour / pruducts of value for it. It has no value. Definitely no moon
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:20:37
Well, we can use our banks to buy coffee tho?
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:00:50
I appreciate your enthusiasm tho, and time taken to respond. I beleive in the tech, just not the meme bullshit.
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:28:07
If you purchased that many, could you sent it to a wallet? In any crypto without the fee eating it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:55:50
For recovering on to another wallet? Didn't realise electrum needed a passphrase....

You might have to wait tho, can't send any bitcoin as the pool is full

Unfortunately the code could be changed... When the miners arnt making money by minting new coins is probably when this will be discussed.

And China, if you hold gold, you will do well.  China will take the reigns from the USA as the world currency. Russia's gold stock will allow them to be independent. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:58:46
If everyone HODL'd there will be no miners as there will be no point in mining, no miners, no value at all. it doesn't make sense. You have to spend it, earn it, give it buy it. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:19:30
No you don't, you just increase the value of Gold to buy out the fiat. leaving Precious metals holders very happy... and you can count crypto as a similar asset. sort of. 
Personally I think the next GFC will happen slightly too soon for crypto to be the safe haven asset over gold, but the one after that it will be ready.

It's not fungible tho. Us dollar has an ID on it, so I guess it's as fungible as the dollar. Easier to track imo.

Just keep forking and you get free money with crypto too, sorry to piss on the "let's trash fiat" bonfire. Fyi I'm all for controlling your own money, empowering 3rd world countries with crypo to cripple their crippling system, but we need to see our shortfalls as well.

Thank goodness I still need that coffee I wanted when the mempool was congested....
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:38:13
That's right, because it has lost that use case. It used to tho. Its not really freeing people from the banking system when most of the populous makes 1-2 transactions a year for over 2k is it?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:37:42
A really hard work around to fix a simple problem that had to be created because people were really stubborn.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:14:09
Welp, the thread under my comment about bitcoin losing its use case as currency got taken off!! Some bloke said the mempool is fine for making 2k transactions... To which I responded that bitcoin isn't really freeing us from the banking sector if the only people able to use it are people transferring 2k or more!
Edit, spelling.
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:03:33
To purchase it, to use bitcoin instead of fiat, to take control of my own money....you know peer to peer digital currency.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:28:42
How wrong he was!! It's not supposed to be used for cash, it's a store of value, or for transactions over $2k! These bankers just don't get it, laugh out loud.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:03:25
But other blockchains have small fees? So they are able to both do small transactions and large ones without the need for second layer yet (second layers will be needed for the amount of txs reqd if crypto go mainstream). Just think core is putting Brembo brakes on a 1980s VW Beetle atm,
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:04:19
Thank you for a thoughtful response.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:17:32
That contradicts the last response I got on r/btc earlier today saying it isn't for buying coffee (like cash) , but for transfers of $2k. I just don't know what to believe.
