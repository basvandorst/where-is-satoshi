Do you think the Bitcoin ATM will be important or are we going to see more of a small resellers taking a margin network (such as M-Pesa [1] or Grameen Bank [2] model)?

We are seeing the first wave of remittances focused companies using bitcoin as an infrastructure or currency. Have a look at:  (UK-Kenya),  (US-Philippines),  (UK-Ghana) etc...
Another article will follow with an in-depth analysis of these solutions, their costs and how they compare to traditionnal services or other currencies, but what we see today is that they are not significantly cheaper than services using the Internet or mobile money (in comparison to cash to cash international money transfers). 
In my opinion, as long as people have to load value in the system and take it out, it will remains so. But if people already hold bitcoin and the recipients can use the value without having to convert it to a fiat currency (peer to peer payments, bill partners, merchants integration etc...), it will be phenomenal.

If the transaction costs on global remittances were cut from where they are today (~10%) to an average of 5%…it would mean that an additionnal $15bn per year would arrive in emerging countries. 
If a sustainable business model can be found to reach such state, is it really bad? Why is making money when dedicating yourself to a good cause so taboo?

Okey, so we don't do anything right? Status quo is better.
