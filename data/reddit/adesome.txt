It's not practical to keep all your cash in a safe at home. That's why we have banks. It's also not practical to keep all your bitcoin on a piece of paper in a safety deposit box. 
Yes, I was there in the Mt. Gox days. I get it. But the ecosystem has matured and it's time to trust *select* third-parties like Coinbase. Everything stored there is backed by insurance, even if Coinbase goes under or their entire system is hacked. Read their terms. They also store 98% offline. 
Locally storing your keys can be very dangerous. A friend of mine lost ~500 BTC when his wife accidentally reformatted his hard drive. Do you really trust yourself to keep track of a paper wallet? Is that even practical? You can't claim BTC is this highly innovative currency AND simultaneously recommend that folks print QR codes and stick them in safety deposit boxes. That's ridiculous. 
Since Coinbase has an insurance policy on all coins stored there, the only way to lose your money is if someone hacks your account specifically. This would happen via a Phishing attack. By using two-factor authentication AND a randomly generated password that is unique to Coinbase, you bring the risk of a Phishing attack to almost 0%.

This does not sound very convenient for the average consumer. Where should I store the paper backups?
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:05:38
I see. This sounds decently accessible to the non-technical early adopter. 
However, you do have to write down this seed somewhere. If you're like my father, you'd never be able to remember a phrase like that. Since you can't remember it, you'll drop it in a notepad on your phone which could easily be deleted or accessed by someone else. It seems more secure to have him write down a password to Coinbase or a similar service that requires phone and email authentication. 
You make a good point. I just worry about the potential for mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:22:47
Yes? Because it is?

Hardly. Banks have existed for thousands of years. They provide a useful service: safely storing your money and making it accessible. Crypto prevents banks and governments from manipulating a currency with a set rate of inflation (among other benefits), but that doesn't mean we don't need third-party services to keep our money safe AND accessible.

What a ridiculous statement. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:13:27
I know. That's my point. Been working pretty well for thousands of years.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:59:06
Agreed! Although I get the sense there is a *right* and *wrong* way in this subreddit. With all the newbies entering the market right now, I think the discussion could be a bit more balanced. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:53:54
Sorry, what's a seed? Would I have to store that somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:22:55
I think this is an important distinction. Perhaps third-parties can serve as the equivalent of a checking account. Savings can be stored more securely, assuming this becomes progressively easier for the average user.

So we will use our charity search partner, FirstGiving, to process to any charity (even if they aren't signed up). They will receive a check in the mail if they aren't registered with FirstGiving. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:03:06
Will do! :-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:01:58
No, we wouldn't profit from the service. 
It would cost 1% for BitPay (they offer 0% for charities, so perhaps they will waive it) and 4.25% to process the donation using FirstGiving (we hope to get this lowered too).
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:30:52
True. In this case, we're working as middleman to convert Bitcoin to USD then process that through FirstGiving. I think they will waive the fee once we show them what we are doing, but as of now we aren't considered a charity. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:30:01
Great point. We will likely provide a receipt from FirstGiving.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:52
Actually, that's not true. Fees are slightly lower, but not by much.
PayPal - 2.2%+30 cents
FirstGiving - 7.5%
Razoo - 4.9%
WePay - 2.9% + 30¢

BitInstant claims to honor the price when you purchase and deliver within an hour, but they totally screwed me yesterday. 
I ordered $196 at 3:11pm when the BitCoin was price around $85.
At 10:09pm, I got an email from CoinBase (the wallet where I sent it) that said:
"You just received 1.52348342 BTC (worth $167.88 USD) from an external bitcoin account."
Absolutely bullshit. Honor the commitments you claim to make on your website. If you can't deliver in an hour, cancel the transaction and give me back my money or deliver the amount of bitcoins at the price when the sale happens. 
The funny thing is I didn't even get $196 worth! I should have received around 2.305 BitCoins! And of course I've heard nothing back from support.
