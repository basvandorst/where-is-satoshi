Difficulty adjustment would make it easier to mine BTC on archaic tech. More miners with old tech replacing the ones going "bankrupt" due to the cost of their pricer tech. The cycle repeats and the archaic tech goes out of use and the high end stuff gets turned back on because of renewed faith in the market.

I don't hate the rich in the slightest. So fuck you, for implying so. I respect the rich. I am simply stating to you, that it is illegal and if you decided to do so, you'd be breaking the "law". Some of us Americans are so obsessed with following the law, that even if their lives depended on breaking a foolish one, they will not do so and die. The Government are the ones I hate. The fact they have dickheads in air conditioned rooms writing this shit up and passing it as law is absurd. The laws being there, give the government at any moment the ability to enforce those stupid laws.
I wouldn't live in the woods because my situation doesn't call for it, but I would disregard those "laws", because to me they are not laws, and literally live off the land. But if 10k-20k people decided to do that in a 5-10sq mile radius, you bet your ass they will suddenly start to enforce those laws, because the last thing the government wants, is you living on their publicly owned land.

Latin America too. My mother lives in the Dominican Republic, and she told me lots of natives over there were being paid in BTC. Granted, the employees would exchange their BTC into USD, and mind you this is in 2010-2013. The Dominican Peso was worth at the time, 38=1USD, but the average workers wage over there is maybe at that time, was 25-100USD, depending on the work. So, these tech oriented offices that handled off shored telecommunications work, would generally pay their workers 200SD-500USD a month in BTC. Only if the employees had held; their money would have appreciated in value, not depreciated, because a DOP is now 49=1USD. That's 7 years of inflation of a currency, any money you put away is worth less, especially if you held in DOP.
This was generally for places that were somewhat tech oriented; also, due to the extremely lax regulations for what you can do with your rented property, cheap cost of living, I can understand why, the workers swapped their BTC into USD, because 300USD a month in these 3rd world countries can net you a nice little life, away from the extreme poverty and literal rolling blackouts and limited by certain days water supply. Like, fuck that noise, you know how much it sucks to deal with 8hours of no electricy and water being limited to M/T/F from 0700 to 1600 hours? Some areas of certain countries are even worse, with no fucking supply what so ever.
This, crypto-currency stuff is amazing because of one thing. We, rich, first world folk are finally allowing the white man to invest his money into a store of value again. Nixon's USD to XAU block was simply a way to make Latin America, Middle East, Africa and even Europe to submit, and embargos are just another way of saying sanctions. And the IMF, is just the Federal Reserve Bank's shitty fork, shoved down everyone's throat on the global level.
Americans used to spread their wealth throughout the entire world, because our money was backed by a limited supply of gold, and we entrusted our representatives to not print up more than what they had....but Vietnam and us using 20,000USD bombs every day to blast the yellow commies 500USD base of operations. Shit, the guns were primarily provided to the VC, by the Russians and AKs are cheap as shit to make. 
The world noticed, the Americans were spending way more then they really could afford, and viola; the whole entire 3rd world's, in-progress transition economy went belly-up, because the only fucking people in the world who are allow to print up their own currency, are the Americans. And who is stuck with all the shitco...ehem dollars? The white boy, the nigga, the spic, the chink, the sand monkey, and shitslavs.

Because, imagine a literal room filled with money from the floor to the ceiling. Imagine how much it weighs, how long it would take to count, how many men to secure it with guns, how many trips to move it from point A to B to C, how would you distribute amgosnt the owners of said money. 
Now with that said, how much do you have to pay people, with that very same room filled of money, to do each and every single one of these tasks. It's looking pretty pricey already if looked at from a yearly basis. You're then offered by an entity, bigger than your entity, that they will store, count, protect with guns, move and digitize all of that paper for you, for a sunk cost of 1 percent of the principal. It's cheaper and now you also have a literal empty room, ready to cook meth out of and make back that 1 percent you "lost" on that negative interest bond.

Not all stocks give dividends, and at best they'll pay out .06-095 of their quarterly earnings. Also, their not all paying out at the same time. Secondly, real estate involves renting out to a modest person who has a stable income, and even then, that household's situation can change in the long run. That doesn't even account for the possibility of those people being slobs.
I'm not saying these two forms of investment are a bad bet, but why not just have a stake in all three? Oh wait, I can't buy my entry into the real estate market and stocks with good dividend rates might not be in my budget. Whaduhamgonnado?

If you sold bad milk to someone in the USA as a licensed vendor, your store/factory/farm would be shut the fuck down instantly by various FEDERAL Agencies(that's where your FED withholding goes to, their salaries.) Personally, I don't believe the market should work with a dick load of regulators, lisencesors and permitors. You buy bad milk? Take the other guy's experience as a warning and don't buy from that vendor. But wait people, the guy who sold you milk, doesn't just milk a cow and get it processed at some local processor up the street. The rabbit hole for the Agricultural industry is a lot deeper than you think.
So, I'm a little retarded, but I'll try to get my point across. Mega farms, mega-factories, mega-stores and commodities stocks control everything agriculture related. The food you eat. AT CENTRALIZED LEVEL this industry pumps out shit food, en-masse. This industries participants also use our legislative system against us to kill off the competition from "The Little Guy on Main Street". So a regular Joe never, ever bothers to become apart of this industry because of extreme regulatory measures taken, that seem to only be able to be met by the mega entities previously mentioned.
Now use critical thinking, if everything down to production, resale laws, distribution produces a bad batch of milk, we have the problem en-masse. Spoiled milk, en-masse, spoiled chicken en-masse, etc. Replace the CENTRALIZED AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY with the CENTRALIZED BANKING INDUSTRY. 
So Banks, who run everything monetary related; what do they do? Loan out a batch of bad loans over a course of time, EN-MASSE, knowing the MILK is spoiled and still keep selling it with no fucks given. Because at the end when you're all having explosive diarrhea and the milk stock commodities is crashing, while also being bought the fuck up at the cheap. 
Add a media campaign on the internet/television to shit on the milk industry and then promote it a few years later to jack the price of stock commodities. Then their FAVORTIRE, cause they own all the cows, land for the cows, pigs, and CANNED NON-PERISHABLES and all the other shit (Literally and figuratively) INFLATION SETS IN AND RISES THE VALUE OF ALL THAT FUCKING MILK!! Do you own a farm, do you own a cow, do you own any of that? Even if you did, you'd be taxed into oblivion and would be better off being a taxed incomewage slave.
This is every single fucking market in America, you can template this concept onto the entertainment industry, the business start-up industry, the housing industry. Everything you do in AMERICA and the WEST is REGULATED AND RULED UPON BEFORE THE ACT IS EVEN TAKEN. Because, if it weren't I'd be selling fucking cheeseburgers and fries off of a LIFETIME table in front of ONE of McPoonadl's store and putting that one store out of business, because I get my cow meat from a LOCAL farmer that is allowed PROCESS MEAT, FOR BURGERS. Oh, lets not forget all the other modern-digital-industrial contraptions we have nowadays too! The possibilities are endless. However, they are endless when stupid people like you open their mouths.

Depending on the space you have allotted and the labour that goes into maintaining and micromanaging all that food isn't worth the cost of "saving" in bulk. That's just a marketing scheme Costco uses to move more product out their bigass stores. Honestly, how much food have you tossed and/or have a fuck ton of canned goods that just sit around. 
Okay, you might have a big family, a lot of mouths to feed, so in your MARKET circumstance, buying bulk is better. But, not every family is big or some folks prefer fresher foods that cannot be bought in bulk because they'd go bad. So now this encourages more trips back and fourth. You realize spending 25 percent more on your grocery bill, avoiding "savings" and buying quality over quantity is the way to go. 
Now, of course this aspect of this market doesn't related to a market like Bitcoin. The idea I mentioned in my previous post is that while you spend a little more "buying on the way down" you learn more about the applications that hold BTC, the ideas being built around it, the social networks and everything else, versus going once a month at buying btc and not really interacting with any of the market's influcence's and productions on humanity's mental playground - the internet.
