The old saying goes, "never try to catch a falling knife". Here's what you can expect in 2014: regulators see bitcoin as a threat to investor safety and enact blue sky laws that prohibit most banks from depositing funds with bitcoin exchanges. BTC for fiat drops precipitously, price is propped up only by BTC's intrinsic value which is... zero. BRB buying some short BTC derivatives. If I could put my life savings in anything it would be BTC puts.

Bitcoin: the only investment considered "stable" at 2559% volatility.

Except bitcoin isn't a currency, its a commodity tied to a currency. If you hold a non net zero BTC position ever then you are investing in the commodity by definition.

Let me give you a scenario explaining why this makes perfect sense and the SEC is not on creating some conspiracy against bitcoin. I am generally neutral-slightly-pro cryptocurrency if that matters. It is all about leverage and potential for market manipulation. It is a classic problem that occurs in many markets, but is infrequent because every securities trader is not anonymous and securities venues are monitored and regulated so there is an expectation that its participants are accountable. Anyway, the scenario. You must be familiar with options
Bitcoin today trades at 1000 usd. For simplicity's sake lets say the ETF also trades at 1000usd per share. I purchase 100,000 ETF shares worth of call options (more technically, 1000 lots since convention is a lot is 100 shares for options) that settle TODAY for a strike price of 1010 USD. Now I wait until we get close to the option expiring - lets say a hour away from expiry. That means, one hour from now if the price is above 1010, I get $100k for every 1 dollar the price is over 1010. Now I employ a strategy called ***"banging the close"***. My objective in this strategy is to ***buy a fuckton*** of real, anonymous blockchain BTC ('the underlying') so that at the end of the hour the price is as high as possible. Every purchase I make influences the market and generally drives the price up. 
So now in this hour window I 'banging the close' **on actual bitcoin - so I am anonymous** and spend $15 million to drive the market up to oh lets say  1200. Other market participants will be very confused by this behavior and they may latch on to the trend or fight against it, but in general (and particularly because bitcoin has no 'intrinsic value') I would guess they will step aside. Just looking at the last few days of trading activity, I dont think it is unreasonable to say injecting 15m of buys into an hour of bitcoin trading would cause a pretty massive spike in price (in other words, increase of 200 points is conservative)
So lets tally up the score:
So I have spent $15m to buy bitcoins and drive up prices to 1200 **(-$15m)**
My bitcoins I bought may be harder to sell back into the market, so lets say I sell them back for $12m. **(+$12m)**. Its possible I make money on this as well if other participants buy into the trend for some reason.
Now for the good part: my options had a strike of 1010, they expired at 1200 meaning I get $190 per option share - which I had 100,000 of **(+$19m)**
-15+12+19 = $16 million dollars made in one day, virtually risk free, just from trading 1) leveraged derivatives and 2) manipulating the market underlying the derivatives. I can quit my job now.
Note: what I ignore here is usually there is a price "premium" paid for the options. It would be hard to speculate what that premium would be because it is a function of how volatile the price is, and as I will explain later, volatility in this market would be be absolutely insane and swing around rapidly. This is just one example of market manipulation strategies which might be used and some others are volatility-neutral (for example, swaps/futures contracts)
This activity, 'banging the close', is extremely illegal. It is also enforceable in the commonly known stock markets (NYSE etc) because every market participant there is registered with their brokerage who are themselves licensed and regulated and forced to keep records which make analysis on unusual trading activity very tractable. It is not easy though. If every participant is anonymous, it becomes impossible. 
As a consequence, because ETFs are a specific type of security which allow for derivatives (or margined/in general leveraged) trading, and because the underlying asset (bitcoin) is inherently untraceable, market manipulation based strategies would run rampant. The end result would be an extremely volatile gambling (or perhaps more accurate analogy is 'game of chicken') market with people being enriched or impoverished overnight, regular bankruptcies and immense price swings. All of it would be completely detached from the real value of bitcoin and the effort spent by those who mine it.
So tldr: Is the SEC a secret society? maybe, idgaf. Did they make the right decision rejecting a bitcoin ETF? probably, yes, because it is inherently a market which can be manipulated (all participants are anonymous) and market manipulation is very bad for anyone who cares about a stable global financial system or the health of Bitcoin itself
