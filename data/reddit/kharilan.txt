I sent 1BTC to my ledger and it cost me like $1.30something. You're getting cheated hard

Wtf? I've sent 1BTC for barely $1. You're getting ripped off.

This whole article is rediculous. You could replace Bitcoin with Gold and it would be exactly the same. When was the last time you saw someone trying to purchase anything with gold rather than just accumulating? Back to Bitcoin, people aren't spending because it still has the potential to drastically increase in value so they're hodling and accumulating.

It was a whale that dropped the price so it'll recover when he swallows up the dip :D

If you don't care about owning actual crypto, go for it. If you want to actually own the rights and seeds for crypto then use an exchange and a hardware wallet. Robinhood is a good app for stocks and crypto investments (not ownership) so you do what you feel fits your needs.

Wait, people on r/bitcoin have bitcoin?!?

Save save save. Pay off debts, build an emergency fund and then use your 'play-with' money for investments. Don't buy what you won't use and never buy what you can't afford.

PM me more in-depth details of your pitch. I'd like to know exactly how you plan on accomplishing this, the roadmap, how you will allow people to "pilot" a cubesat (they're non-maneuverable). You mention it having 3-axis altitude control -is this electrolysis propulsion you're planning? The average life of smaller cubesats, such as the 3U you're planning, is usually anywhere from a single revolution to a year due to atmospheric drag so what do you plan after that? There's a lot of questions that aren't answered anywhere that I feel you should have somewhere. Your websites home page is 50% QR code and very vague information. I'm not calling this a scam but it needs to be more professional if you're wanting to be taken seriously.

I feel bad for laughing but it's like you drew on it with one of those jumbo crayons

Buy when you feel you're ready and don't panic. I originally invested strictly into stocks so when i started in bitcoin, i'd panic inside when i saw a move as low as $50 (it's jarring at first since most of my stocks move a few cents/dollars per day). Fast forward and now I don't even bat an eye at being down several thousand from last weeks $9k peak. I know it'll level out eventually and if not, then thats why I never invest what I can't afford to lose.

Unless you've never made large deposits/withdrawls from your account, you shouldn't need to contact your bank. It never hurts, of course, but i've never had issues.

Was looking at the price yesterday and was thinking i'd buy some more if we dropped again. Woke up today and saw we dipped under 8k so I bought another 0.5BTC. It's a win in my book.
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:17:03
Hate to be the bearer of bad news here but there's a very high possibility you just poofed $5k. Every exchange i've ever used has had 1-2 warnings about not sending BTC/BCH to the other's wallet due to losing it all in an improper transfer. Hopefully they can manage to correct the error, but if they can't that's an expensive lesson learned to double-triple-quadruple check your transactions before you finalize.

Here's a post with links verifying the manipulation.

I feel as though you're not actually asking for advice but rather this is a humble brag to validate some insecurities going on in your life currently. Who hurt you?

You’re ignorant if you think Warren Buffet is a moron. He’s invests in what he knows and uses and it’s made him the greatest investor in modern history. Why would he change now? Crypto is a new industry, he doesn’t use it in his daily life and it hasn’t been around long enough for anyone to see how it will truly behave. The price is based on speculation in this current day and that alone keeps him from investing.

To be fair, I only know this as I've purchased claim of Bitcoin through Robinhood purely for flipping for easy profits to throw back into various stocks. I view it no differently than any other stock I plan on day trading, though I do own actual Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:00:13
You aren't really buying Bitcoin, you're claiming a virtual ticket that says you claim the right to the value of a bitcoin. Robinhood Crypto is purely for investing/speculating and not for actual cryptocurrency ownership.

There will always be crashes after rises. When prices spike, people sell which drives the demand down and in turn drives the prices back down. Prices then bottom and people buy them up causing the demand and prices to rise again. Basic supply-demand.
