As a foreigner living in Shanghai, how can I buy bitcoin without having to deal with online transfers? Are you guys planning on introducing a bitcoin atm? The one in Pudong is way to far away from the city center..
@_date: 2014-06-22 12:33:52
How are you guys going to deal with scammers on both sides? Cryptothrift has escrow, so the scammers just convince people to go outside it.

It's more than at the bank, but I don't mind paying a little extra to not have to deal with an hour+ at a Chinese bank, with bank officials who seem personally offended that a foreigner wants to transfer money out of China. Add in an exorbiant wite fee, and it comes out roughly equal.

Less than an hour? The biggest bottleneck with btcc seems to be that they only send withdrawals when their own pool mines a block. I can understand why, but it's a pain in the ass. rmb&gt;btc is instant, the btc withdraw to my wallet is usually an hour - but can sometimes take up to 90 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:36:22
Usually to my bitpay card, then ACH'd to my USD bank account. I use it to get (legal) money out of China with a minimum of hassle and fees.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:16:20
My btcc withdraw limit is still 100btc/day.
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:23:09
yep. but i already had it increased a few years ago from 10btc/day manually.

No, Firstview Financial. Happened to me on February 12th. [Firstview hasn't even told Bitpay which accounts have been closed. ]( 
@_date: 2019-02-15 10:56:48
If you think that's shitty, their bank partner just closed a bunch of accounts with no warning and no reason given. I'm travellig in Vietnam now, so being left with $90 and no other way of getting cash was a really pleasant surprise.
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:57:16
Oh, for sure. Never kept a balance, just loaded and withdrew. But it sucked losing a card I needed for travel cash. Wound up meeting a guy from localbitcoins.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:42:25
Yeah, the same thing happened to me two days ago. Live long term in China, travelling in Vietnam. Bitpay left me in the lurch with $90 and no way of getting more cash. Just account cancelled, no explanation given, and a poor attitude from the customer service rep, like I was asking a favor of them to access my money. Luckily I was able to meet up with someone from localbitcoins, but it's outrageous how this situation was handled.

Silver was demonetized in 1873, via the Fourth Coinage Act. It wasn't so much a broken promise as an upgrade to a better metal, ie gold. The 1792 silver coin purity had already been reduced in 1853.

A silver Morgan dollar was a coin weighing 0.7734oz troy of silver. Gold was the basis of all other measurements, and was fixed by law at $20.67/oz. Silver coins were fiat like paper money, and a silver dollar did not have an intrinsic value of a dollar. There were gold coins of $2.50, $5, $10, and $20, which were the standard in the West, but brought a higher value in silver or paper in different parts of the country. Eg $5 in gold could get you $6 in silver, or $10 in paper.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:27:15
Yes,  but there was less than a dollar's worth of silver in those coins. The US was firmly on the gold standard by 1924. Most countries (excluding China) were off silver by the 1880's.

The purchase price of silver was set by Congress. Greshham's law and seigniorage resulted in that value being lower than $1/ounce. The massive silver strikes in Carson City and elswhere in the world glutted the market. Silver interests lobbied for increased silver dollar production, and got it in the form of the Bland-Allison and Sherman Acts. The two acts required the government to purchase roughly 8 million ounces of silver a month, to be coined. Mining companies were paid with coin notes, a type of US currency which could be redeemed in gold or silver. Via Greshham's law, the cheaper and more plentiful silver drove the rarer gold out of circulation. This drove the price of silver down relative to gold, to $1.16 an ounce in 1890, and $0.6 in 1895. By 1895, a $1 Morgan only contained 46 cents in melt value. (0.7734oz x $0.60/ounce)

You don't seem to understand how Chinese businesses work. Every company has a Communist Party official as a paid employee, whose job it is to ensure that all actions and decisons are made according to government wishes. They are not referring to themselves as an authoritarian government, even though we know they are.
