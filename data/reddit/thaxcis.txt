Looks like denial to me.

See you at 2000.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:51:10
Good for you. I just sold :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:57:55
Indeed. I bought in at 4000 and sold at 8000. Should have sold at 18k, but whatever.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:30
tears of joy for selling ;)

Except bitcoin is not an asset. Enjoy it. I will enjoy my watch. I already placed my order.

That makes me wonder if this has more to do with preventing people from trying to get their ‘investment’ back if the currency falls via some kind of claim, since credit cards can have more protection over debit purchases.

Because I enjoy luxury watches. Why do people buy a Ferrari? Some to show off, others because they enjoy it. If I wanted to show off I would buy a Rolex. It also is a stable asset, unlike bitcoin.

selling at 9k is the new top. Glad i sold.

Thanks. Good luck to you

The intelligent investor by Benjamin graham mentions this (which he highly recommends) and Warren Buffet has stated the same, or similar, on one of his talks on Bloomberg TV.
EDIT: Warren Buffett: "Trying to time the market" is the  mistake to avoid.
People that think they can predict the short-term movement of the stock market — or listen to other people who talk about (timing the market) — they are making a big mistake," says Buffett.

Sorry, but you are so wrong in everything you say. Here are some quotes.
Warren Buffett: "Trying to time the market" is the  mistake to avoid".
Yep, that's him saying that. I suggest you read Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham also
People that think they can predict the short-term movement of the stock market — or listen to other people who talk about (timing the market) — they are making a big mistake," says Buffett.

Warren Buffets predictions fuels a short term speculative gain as people follow his investments. He invests stocks over a long term though, so these short term gains are insignificant to him. He does not value market timing. Benjamin Graham also said that market timing is 5% of overall profits, vs 95% picking the right investments. Bitcoin on the other hand is a speculative trade and mostly about market timing. That's not a bad thing, it's just different. More risk, more reward.

Ah my bad, you are correct.
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:29:56
now THAT sounds like a bubble to me. Once the news is all about how students lost their savings, THEN is the time to speculate on bitcoin for nice gains.
