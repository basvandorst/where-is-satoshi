I just noticed I had an error on my original post, just fixed it (cause this is exactly what I did). Sorry for the confusion.


Is this valid advice for any exchange or just GDAX?
But aren't stop loss orders supposed to be the best way to minimize losses or I've been reading that wrong?

Understood. Thank you again.

Excellent choice, You should post this over at :)

So the limit must *always* be above the stop?


What you are saying is that if the price crashed immediately to 13000, my order wouldn'y have been triggered and if this was really a flash crash, it would have recovered some minutes later and I wouldn't be wiped out, right?

I don't know. It was based on my wrong understanding of how these orders work.
I bought at ~7300 and I just wanted to maximize my gains if, for some reason, the price started to go down as crazy as it went up, that's all.
What would you've recommend I should've done to maximize my gains on this situation?

I understand now. Thank you for that :)
P.S: I see what you're saying about GDAX but I've personally never had issues such as those. But will keep that in mind :)

What if the limit is above the stop price?

Cool. Thanks :)
