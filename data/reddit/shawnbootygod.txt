They might, but you have nothing to fear as a law abiding citizen who pays their taxes right? Coinbase stated before they wouldn't turn over records to the government but they were subpoenaed for them and gladly handed them over.
If you hold your money in crypto for over a year and then file long term capital tax, you're only gonna be taxed 20% so it's nothing really to be worried about

I just want to say first off, this is what keeps the community as a whole healthy and not only are you doing good in the world you're also giving bitcoin a good name. Thank you for doing something like this.
My brother had cancer when he was younger and he's since recovered but we were invited to children's cancer camp to help the children with cancer cope and relate to people who are going through the same circumstances as themselves. The siblings of the kids also get to come because often times the siblings don't receive as much attention (when your brother's life is on the line you often feel neglected and it's hard to cope for younger kids who don't quite understand selflessness yet). I was invited when i was 15, 9 years ago. I've gone every year since then, volunteer as a counselor for the past 6 years.
The camp is called Camp Sunrise &amp; Sidekicks and was funded by the American Cancer Society. 4 years ago the American Cancer Society reallocated all funds towards only cancer research and we lost funding. The directors of the camp whom have been volunteers for 30+ years started a new foundation to continue the camp called Southwest Kids Cancer Foundation.
The camp is still going strong but since losing funding we've had to cut down a lot of what we used to do. The camp is growing in numbers still and we're always trying to get sponsors and donations to keep up. It would be a blessing to receive any sort of donation and if not i still appreciate what you're doing.
Thank you for taking the time to listen and if anybody else is interested in donating please pm me and i can get you in contact with the foundation.

All BTC are halted, they sent out two emails about it over the past 3 weeks. They're waiting until the blockchain is stabilized because of the Hardfork

I'm not suggesting a downvote brigade, but there are more than 4 on there, some are just downvoted enough to be hidden (can see them on alien blue). I just think it's interesting they're basically buying people or attempting at least

Ideals matter a lot to governments and it sets a precedent. That's why the Gold Dinar was stopped

Bitcoin is strong and will continue to be bitcoin. The hard forks that we end up selling for more bitcoin might hurt right now and slow growth due to minor loss are only temporary

Where can I read about the 2mb commitment and the hard fork you're referring to? I've read a lot about Segwit and UASF but have only heard people referencing the 2MB commitment over 12 months, never an explanation

You'll forever be waiting for the dip if this is your logic towards it. Buy when you can and hold it long term

Well...this is kind of how the government works if we're being honest. This is how pretty much all customer/consumer/citizen feedback works actually. Enough people complain or make a suggestion, a change will be made. Why not voice their opinion? Maybe not through the ticketing system but through a different feedback outlet to not clog up their customer support system albeit, but they have a right to provide feedback on a service they use.
More than likely one person closing their account will have no effect but that's their choice to stop supporting business practices they disagree with. Don't be so condescending.

So real life example here: My phone got wet and stopped working. I no longer have access to my google authenticator on that device, which means it's gonna be a bitch to prove I'm really me on a couple of the exchanges. Same thing can happen to phone wallets

To start out I bought a Ledger HW.1 it's a hardware wallet that stores your coin offline. Not incredibly techy but it's nice and I got it for $17 from Cryptohwallet

Unfortunately I have not. That's why I asked. I can't find anything about it being postponed, just that YouTube video
