I agree. The mind boggling ignorance of Americans has been well studied and documented.

I think we should use only Bitcoin and Satoshi.
I wrote a post here:

It's just a handy time-saver, that's all. I like it and I will use it. It will be more handy as BTC rises and we start using smaller units more frequently. I would like to stick with just Satoshi myself. I think the others are superfluous but there is not much agreement on that. :)

Yeah...it's a bit of a mouthful though. If we ever do trade in Satoshi at least if we start now it will have gained significant traction. :)

We don't have to agree...something will just stick and it will be the new norm.
The only name I like for a fraction is Satoshi but it's a wee bit tiny.

If you aren't paying for power, why not pop a little mining op in her belly. (Disclaimer: I know nothing about ATM bellies.)

I love it! Please make an iOS app.

Double Wow! Wow!

What? I'm confused by your words. However, I am not confused by cointools.info.

I'm Canadian. Lots of ignorance north of the border and everywhere else in the world. It was just a flippant comment. I should have said 'some' Americans. I grew up watching shows where they ask Americans aboutCanada. The answers were shocking...of course....it's television.

I agree with the OP. I know several people who are interested in cryptos but want to go with altcoins b/c btc is "too expensive". I always tell them they don't have to buy a whole one!
I always offer to shave off a bit of my "gold" just to give them a taste. :)
I think people will not be too excited about their .000234 BTC but if it was 234 whatevesies it might "feel" more valuable. Just my 2 BTC. That's right! 2!!!!
