Open source block chain voting is transparency and security, not the "same tyranny through mob rule." 
As it currently stands, the 1 percent rule, not the "mob."

This was really just a clever marketing technique to increase the bid amounts.

How would society progress if everyone who felt the way you do (me included) refused to support the lesser of two evils? Isn't great change made through small steps  like this (which is actually quite a large step if implemented), instead of all at once?

You're asking why inflation is a bad thing, right?

It's OK for us, unfortunate for BitPay. The Bitcoin community will come out on top, and everything will be decentralized. Bye bye BitPay and otherpayment processors, and and bye bye Coinbase exchanges. The only weak link I see a federal law preventing banks from dealing money processors and decentralized exchanges.

I wouldn't be so quick to claim that Ecuador banned bitcoin. I don't see any solid proof of this.

Illegality doesn't (or shouldn't) necessarily invalidate the concept of theft.
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:54:41
So true. The Federal Reserve even has a goal to devalue the dollar 30 percent over the next 20 years.
But as long as things are running reasonably smooth, your typical consumer doesn't care about this and views Bitcoin as more riskier than the dollar. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:49:19
I'd say it's a very possible scenario. They absolutely understand the potential Bitcoin has, and if they don't get in on the action they could be fucked down the line.

Seems like centralizing power and control is a natural human tendency.

Yea...they are doing this because they are required to by law.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:46:44
This is true. How can this be solved? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:46:10
In all seriousness, it could be argued from a governmental point of view that obtaining a large amount of bitcoins is of critical national security interest. They wouldn't want to be left out in the cold if Bitcoin ever became the default internet currency.

Great article but I think the main job of the CFPB is to educate consumers on risks, which they did somewhat decently.
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:32:28
When consumers are provided similar protections as they currently have with banking and credit cards. Just my opinion. Why would anyone who doesn't ideologically support Bitcoin want to risk losing their money?

I don't believe this is true.. inflation leads to an increase in the price of everything, so you have to spend more to acquire the same goods.

much more to use than credit cards or even
regular cash.

What the fuck CFPB?
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:42:35
Well said. But one thing I'm curious about is (devil's advocate of course), if everyone is breaking their laws, couldn't the government inevitably block the flow of USD into bitcoin exchanges and payment processors? That would be way worse than actually complying with regulations.
@_date: 2014-08-10 21:35:14
That's a glaring "or" there. Look, we can exchange various definitions of theft all day long, but when someone doesn't believe that a specific law itself is morally justified, then what good is a definition based on the law?
@_date: 2014-09-05 22:14:17
I agree that democracy at best is the will of the majority imposed through threat of force upon the minority, but I'm not so sure we even have that kind of democracy right now.
I think that the point is that block chain based voting is ridiculously better than the current system and definitely a step in the right direction. I feel that saying that using block chain voting would be the same tyranny is slightly misleading because right now we're more like an oligarchic corporatocracy than a democracy.
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:37:56
There's one problem I can't find a solution to. There has to be a middle man to transfer USD to bitcoin, at least until the Bitcoin ecosystem is large enough that everyone is both paying and receiving in bitcoin.

This is the only legal option they have. The Fed can't just take confiscated property for themselves.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:12:55
A side thought: Decentralized exchanges seem to be an inevitable step for bitcoin. Problem is, centralized exchanges like coinbase are making millions. They have a lot to lose if decentralized exchanges take over.. So, I think that we will start to see centralized exchanges like coinbase fighting to maintain "control" in a similar fashion to how banks and governments are doing with bitcoin in general. Thoughts?
edit: coinbase not coindesk
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:44:23
Or at least a "the US Marshal Service [said in an email][told Coindesk][etc][etc]"

What a great event. Storj and BitHalo are my two favs.

How is it a false dichotomy? I didn't claim there were only two options. I just claim that one is better than the other, and is on the path to the ideal solution, so why wouldn't you support an improved system?
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:58:41
I think the internet changes that. It's only a matter of time. And decentralized software like BitHalo could provide accountability.

This actually is similar to the Syrian conflict. The US began waging covert warfare in Syria as early as 2006, and then began funding, arming and training "jihadis" to overthrow Assad.
In Venezuela, the US has also been waging a covert war since before 2002. The Bush administration was caught attempting to overthrow Chavez.
Guaido went to school in the US and is pretty much a CIA asset.
Socialism isn't the main driving force behind Venezuelans starving -- it's US sanctions that are causing people to suffer.
Stop falling for US propaganda. They use similar lies every time. Remember when they lied 900 individual times about Iraw having WMDs? 
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:57:33


Then the US needs to prove that, and then it's up to the Venezuelan people to hold elections. Guiado unilaterally declared himself president, and most Venezuelans don't even know who he is. This is similar to Donald Trump winning the election but Russia and China claiming that he cheated, and insisting that Nancy Pelosi is now the official president and that if Trump doesn't step down they will invade. That's literally what is happening.

In all seriousness, Musk and Tyson have recently said that they don't forsee the flying car ever becoming a safe alternative. Something to do with increased risk and complexity associated with moving three dimensionally as opposed to two dimensionally.
