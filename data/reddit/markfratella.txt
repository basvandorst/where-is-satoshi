The problem is that there is never any follow up. I escalated it on December 1 and nothing had been resolved. I get canned responses outlining how long it takes for funds to clear.

Still no resolution.  In fact, your social media person just told me on Twitter, that it can only be resolved via tickets.  However, these tickets have been open for a week.  I want my money.  I have 4 transactions that have been processing for 3 weeks.

There's no excuse for it to take this long.  It has soured me to Kraken/Glidera and I will no longer be using either for purchases.

I'll give credit where credit is due.  Once I started complaining almost hourly to customer support, it was resolved.  Finally got my last funding from 11/20 yesterday (12/10).

3 WEEKS!!  And I'm still waiting.  What in the world is the issue?

Moreover, all your Twitter people say is to escalate it.  It gets escalated and nothing ever happens.

2 out of 4 went through, but the one from 11/20 is still pending. Seriously. I was going to plan on start using Kraken for various currencies, but the way glidera has handled this, I'm not fixing kraken with a 10 foot pole

I've been dealing with that escalation link and it's like someone replies once and then forgets about it.  I've had one of my transactions go through and the rest are still processing...from 11/20!  DO SOMETHING.  This is ridiculous.
