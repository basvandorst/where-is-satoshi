He still knows what the codes are.

He is the one that is claiming that he has to increase the cost "due to demand".
I'm talking about the price he charges for the coins (and I'm guess he is also) i.e. the price above the "coin value". Even if he had kept the price the same lets say .5 BTC over the value, since 2012 that means the price he charges has gone from like $2.50 USD to about $7.50 USD.

It would also makes the coins completely unusable as coins. The only way to verify the code (as far as I know) not only would the code have to be kept with the coin and also to look at the code in the coin ("destroying") it.
Just keeping the matching codes with the coins is kind of a pain.

I don't think he even has that listed in his faq yet. He still says there are about 11,000 $1 series 1 bitcoins.

I find it very weird that people that don't seem to trust anything else would trust this guy. Despite his best assurances there really is nothing stopping him from cashing out everything. His only assurance is that he posted what is supposed to be his home address, this would really be no different than sharing your bitcoin codes with someone on the internet simply because they gave you their name and address.


Funny how he says that gold, silver, and bitcoin are the only types of real money, yet he can basically print as much of this as he wants and somehow it didn't become less valuable by printing more.

Even if he has the best intentions I could imagine the temptation if somehow you ended up up with something like a couple million dollars sitting there unclaimed or if something terrible were to happen and you really felt like you needed the money.
