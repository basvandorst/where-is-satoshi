Did you mean repost a new thread emphasizing the issue of the address being multi-sig instead of a normal address?
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:51:44
Thanks for your reply. I found some old archived threads that didn't let me post because they are too old, and I couldn't find anyone having issue with multi-sig address. If anyone finds a similar multi-sig address Dark Wallet issue, please point me to it.

Is the conversion tool you are referring to different than this one (made by  I believe)?

I am the cosigner for both cosigning addresses... Last I checked Dark Wallet devs went AWOL. I couldn't find any "dark wallet support" anywhere is there any?

Yes, but it keeps failing because it wont connect to the "unsystem" (error message on top right corner): 
 The last withdrawal that says "none" instead of how long ago, it failed:

I says multi-sig: 
Not sure if it's both multi-sig and segwit. Is that possible?

I have the 12-word passphrase. I can’t get the tool to give me the private key for my address. It keeps generating private keys for different addresses...

I just want to thank  for spending over 5 hours so far (in reddit chat), trying to help me retrieve this stuck BTC.  has been extremely helpful, patient, kind and friendly. Definitely deserves a nice tip after we succeed :-)
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:48:47
Cool. Sorry, wasn't sure if it was appropriate. Not very familiar with Reddit rules :-)
This is the address I'm referring to: 
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:19:37
it starts with 97

Thank you for your reply Samurai :-)
I was able to extract these 17 addresses and their private keys:

Would it be possible to tell which of these 17 addresses private keys I would need, or how to extract the right 3 private keys? Thanks for your support :-)

We were able to export 17 private keys belonging to 17 regular addresses (starting with a '1') but haven't been able to export a private key for the multi-sig address: 33RZTwkqqixKySFim1oSXVcFFBAPUiBwLG
or any private key for the 3 stealth addresses used to create it:
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:43:44
Is it ok to post it here?
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:21:54
We also tried this one 
But for some reason, it kept telling me some of my words "are not in the wordlist"
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:16:16
Hmm... When I go to Settings -&gt; Show seed it gives me one 12-word seed and one 32 alphanumeric string of characters...
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:39:39
Hi. I've done that in the past with regular/newer wallets. But when I try that with this Dark Wallet seed using with different wallets apps on my phone, I keep getting "invalid phrase" or "generic error" messages... Could that be due to multi-sig address created using stealth addresses?
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:09:56
Could this script perhaps be used in Samurai wallet with my 12-word Dark Wallet seed?
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:42:39
I have done that in the past with regular BTC addresses, but I can't seem to get it to work with my address starting with a '3', which I believe is a multi-sig address :-(
Any ideas?
