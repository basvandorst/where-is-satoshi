No comment on that webarchive link I gave you...

I just don't feel like arguing with someone who gets so upset over these things. Adults knows how to have conversations.

He said no one was running the bitcoin network. My point was the miners and the nodes are. Not that something like that could happen.

Wow. I really got under your skin with a simple comment. You say it didn't happen because someone on reddit said it didn't?
Maybe you should go correct the wiki then. They have sources on their stuff.
If Satoshi never used a centrally controlled source repository and never gave it over to Gavin how did Gavin get it?
What's this? 
So he was a threat to the security model because he wanted to up the size of the blocks. That seems a bit extreme.

Lightning network or do you think bitcoin does that?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:11:06
All the miners/nodes run the Bitcoin network. If they all stopped no transactions would happen. The lightning network works off of smart contracts but I have no idea how those are processed but they have to be somehow.

People were spending bitcoin in the beginning. Only lately since the price has been going through the roof that the whole store of value came up. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many retailers that take bitcoin.

BTC didn't have many transactions in the beginning. It took 5 years just to hit 10 million transactions total so it isn't a fair comparison.

Imagine you start the company Arby's and then you leave it to another guy. Then a bunch of other people join in and team up against the person to get their way and force that guy out and change how Arbys works and then keeps the Arbys name. BCH people aren't the only ones ripping off brand names.

It still says he was the lead developer after Satoshi left.

Everyone keeps getting excited about this second layer Lightning but I thought one of the points of Bitcoin was to stop going through a 3rd party to send your money. It just seems like we are switching from letting a bank do it to the guys who run the lightning network.

It says aug 25 but this must be really old. $90 for one btc and a market cap of 1 billion.

If no one ever spent bitcoins in the beginning they wouldn't have any value now. Be glad people did things like that.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:47:22
Be glad people didn't all hold. People using it to purchase things is what got the value to go up. That and the news articles that ran when people did things like spend 10000 bitcoin on a pizza. I wonder how many more people joined in on bitcoin from just that one article alone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:14
I for one am glad the pizza guy did what he did. That was spammed all over the internet and informed a lot of people about bitcoin existence. If no one ever spent bitcoin in the beginning it wouldn't be worth anything now.

What is electrum doing that the core wallet can't do?  
I only know a few people with bitcoin but all of them use the core wallet.
