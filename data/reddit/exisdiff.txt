.....and smoothness is key for the currency, imo, but I think that is also what you're getting at.  A current problem for the currency may be that new adopters see this big ugly spike in the past not too long ago. A discovery of a trend tho, often also kills the trend. One of these repeats may be the last one, so we'll have to see. Equally, according to 'normal' economic principles holding inventory of any kind, stalls an economy, makes the price drop more. Of course, crypto doesn't fall under 'normal' economic principles (yet), so it is unsure how this normal expected economic effect will manifests(/is manifesting?) in crypto.

Yes, it does seem that it is as simple as that.
I am finding too that this '51%' number is mysterious and not meaningful.
As a thought experiment, even if a majority of any size continues to collude then what can they collude against in any successful manner? To specifically target exclusion of utxo's in any organised manner seems very, very unlikely, and economically just as prohibitive. And if it were to become clear that transactions are being excluded, that would immediately give away the perpetrators upon which people would avoid the blocks of the colluders.

Him being the bad cop trashing the 'other crap', and Anthony Pompliano putting in some good words for Bitcoin. If you watch more interviews between them, then overall Bitcoin is made look good. People like O'Leary know how to work the media to support his view at the same time as hedging his view. He is not wanting to being known for having a big chunk in crypto and expose himself to future judgement in the event Bitcoin hits a slump in the market.
They simply agree together beforehand on the overall outcome of the interview, while pretending to be disagreeing on the details during the interview; make Bitcoin look good, make other coins look bad, and give a subtle warning about volatility and security as to not expose Bitcoin to security unaware participants who could damage the reputation of Bitcoin.

Yes, because,  difficulty ≠ probability. For example, if you stand behind a dart board, the difficulty will always be the same at a certain distance. However, each time you throw the dart your probability increases that you will hit the bulls eye.
In a [bell curve]( the probability of 'guessing' the hash at ten minutes is the highest as a result of *hashrate* \* *difficulty* . Sometimes there are individual outliers, and a block is guessed in 2 minutes or it can take hours. However, the mean processing time will hover around 10 minutes. If the bell curve has shifted away from 10 minutes average, pretty much directly as result of hash rate fluctuations, then at every 2016 block the difficulty gets readjusted.

Here is the [original reddit comment]( that this news article is based off.
Below quote stood out for me:


In the highly hypothetical conspiracy that if an adversary *of any size* (be it 10% or 90% size) were *able* to collude and select a number of unspent transactions (utxo's) to either double-spend or censor, *any other transaction will still be processed*. In my view this is a delay in service and saying 'attack' is overstating a problem that is already very unlikely.
In terms of unlikelihood of a delay of service, we are talking about a lot of miners needing to get on the same page and to have a willingness to target a few utxo's and to also compromise the value of their *own* network and mining equipment, foregoing billions of sats in mining revenue for a very small economic benefit. The large penalty vs small reward ratio is very prohibitive for an adversary to entertain this. This is even assuming that they are even *able* 1) to collude *and* 2) to meaningfully target anyone in the first place.
Please correct if you don't find the above a fair representation of this hypothetical issue.

If you are talking from a miners perspective, yes. (Which I also referred to)
If you talk from a global perspective, it - quite obviously - depends on the global hashrate.
It is essentially the same, as both have the same proportional probability to find the block, but any factors influencing (such as better equipment, or competitors dropping out) a share/portion, (either yours or others), will affect the probability of their share then as well.
If you make a statement, please try to back it up with a source or an explanation.

The [idea that prices are determined by the cost of production]( comes from a central planning doctrine. The market price for anything is controlled by supply and demand. Of course, supply is partly affected by the ability to supply/'flow', but to be claiming that 'because it is more expensive to produce, prices *must* go up' is ignoring the demand side. Not that I mind what could be a self-fulfilling prophecy when enough people believe it.

'*Probability\_(how\_hard\_or\_easy\_it\_is)\_to\_find\_a\_block*' = hashrate \* difficulty . And, profitability = '*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*' \* BTC price
*Hashrate* is a variable and is the total hashes/unit time of all the miners hashing on the network. Miners have direct control on the hashrate by increasing or decreasing capacity.
[*Difficulty*]( is a static unit for 2016 blocks and is adjusted up or down every 2016 blocks, respectively when it takes shorter or longer than 20160 minutes to complete 2016 blocks. This is to target 2016 blocks to be processed in 20160 minutes, 10 minutes/block. (The reason that 10 minutes is chosen is a different topic, but relates to security of the network)
*'Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block'* is the chance/probability (as a product of *hashrate* \* *difficulty*) that your hashing 'guesses/hashes/calculates' the right answer that earns you the 'right' to process the block and this is your Proof of Work to get the block rewards + collection of fees. This [video uses the analogy "from the miners perspective \[the hashing\] is like a miniature lottery"]( also indicating that fluctuating hashes on the network, varies the chances ('*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*') to 'win' the block.
If the *hashrate* changes (despite *difficulty* still staying the same) , then so do your chances ('*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*') change as there are more or less hashes competing to 'guess' the right hash in the 'miniature lottery'.
As *profitability* = '*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*' \* *BTC price* , when '*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*' is easier as result of temporary drop in hashes, then it becomes temporarily more profitable, despite the current difficulty not immediately being changed. And also despite increases or decreases in the time it takes to process blocks on the network. This is because when there is a drop in hashrate it means that still roughly the same amount of hashes needed to be completed to find the block with the current difficulty and process the block, which takes longer with less hashing power. However, your proportional share in the total number of hashes has increased, therefore increasing your chances to guess the hash and find the block.


The reward stays the same, but not the chances to collect more block rewards, as you have less competition and a higher chance of guessing the correct hash and higher chance of collecting block rewards + fees -&gt; more profitable. From the perspective (which I think is how you look at it) of *how\_hard\_it\_is\_in\_terms\_of\_hashing\_power\_required\_to\_find\_the\_block* it does remain just as hard as the same amount of hashes are required to find the block, but there is a subtle difference with the perspective of the miner who will have an increased proportional share in with an overall decreased hashrate.


It can become easier/harder as result of upcoming difficulty adjustments, but also partly as a result of current fluctuations in hashrate.




It can become easier/harder as result of upcoming difficulty adjustments, but also partly as a result of current fluctuations in hashrate.
I have laid it out how I understand it. If you feel I am incorrect, please let me know. I think it is easy to conflate *difficulty* and '*Probability\_to\_find\_a\_block*', but they are different variables. Unless I have missed something, through deduction I think it makes sense that hashrate fluctuations have an immediate impact on your chances to 'win' a block + reward + fees.

I am not sure where your assumption comes from that economic swings has anything to do with trading in different means of exchange and why that obfuscates measuring the price/purchasing power of something.
It think it is useful to view 'economic swings' in the light of peoples time preference on when they want and think it is valuable to spend or invest for the most value possible. Little to do with a 'lag in ability'. It is just a price adjustment, be it inflationary or deflationary, as a result of not being priced at a value that humans deem valuable at a time they want to invest in it. Any [intervention in adjusting the price]( and the flow of money, is assuming that a central planning body knows better what it is valuable for its citizens, than the citizens know for themselves. Central planning probably does know best what is best for the central planning body themselves.

Difficulty ≠ Probability.
If you stand behind a dart board, the difficulty will always be the same at a certain distance. However, each time you throw the dart your probability increases that you will hit the bulls eye.
By way of comparison, if it takes a darter on average 12 minutes to hit the bulls eye, you can adjust the difficulty by putting him a little closer to the board, so the darter comes out at 10 minutes average.
If suddenly another darter joins in, increasing the throws of darts, then your average time to hit the bull eye will drop to, say, 7 minutes. Then you increase the difficulty by putting them both further away from the board, so that the average time stays 10 minutes.
If one darter suddenly pulls out, there is one left hitting the board, and from his perspective, his chances are temporarily increased to hit the the bulls eye. This is *despite* still being a little further from the board, but this isn't enough to completely offset the increased probability of hitting the bulls eye from reduced competition.
In my view, this is analogous to how the difficulty of hashing is adjusted with respect to hashrate to come out at 10 minute average block time.


It is random within a range and also infinite within a range (which is linguistically a paradox, but it probably still the best way to describe it) , but the end result (average block time of 10 minutes) is anything but random. The randomness is tightly controlled by the number of hashes the network (or you) have available to guess and the the number of guesses to guess from, that is tightly controlled by the difficulty.

I think it is because these people fall for the [broken window fallacy]( (or [Chapter 2)]( and think that any spending is good spending, even it is wasteful spending.
Spending a lot of money on crappy things at the very end of the value add chain, can't possibly be good for an economy. However, spending money on something making and selling a product that enriches both you and someone you sell to, should be good for the economy.
In the fiat economy, monetary mechanisms, such as inflation, are set up in such a way that it forces people to have a [low time preference]( for money, encouraging wasteful spending. If you have a currency where you can choose your own time preference, you will buy that product at a time when it is of most value to you, and in that way you'll have an economy that is much smarter about buying and selling products and managing its resources.
The notion of 'geld moet rollen' is, I think, conveniently misinterpreted to encourage wasteful spending. It does make sense that for people to prosper they need to trade goods and services with each other, and in order to do so, goods and services including money needs to circulate. I think this may have been how the saying was originally intended (I don't think the Nederlandsche Bank originally came up with it, the saying is much older than that I suspect). It wouldn't be good for an economy if you are the carpenter, somebody else the farmer, and somebody else the bricklayer, but no one is lending services to each other and everyone just hoards their own commodity and/or currency. So 'geld moet rollen' for value-adding goods and services is good, but encouraging 'geld moet rollen' for wasteful spending is non-sensical.

I don't know, I think it does actually help if authorities 'get' it or actually even support it. Bitcoin itself is as permissionless as it can be and theoretically it can't be made illegal, but a whole bunch of red tape can still be very prohibitive and restrictive for users.
It sounds like [Montana]( of all places, is actively having a look at making legislation 'compatible' with crypto. What 'making compatible' sounded like for the most part was unwinding a whole bunch of nonsense regulation. Also, as an example, it would be a huge win, if jurisdictions adopt legislation stipulating that [you can't be forced to give up your private keys](
It is more a step in the right direction, than in the wrong direction that the NZ government recognises crypto. All it really says is just pay taxes in NZ dollars anyway, which is a better sign than being accused as criminals with no evidence.

I am not convinced either. It seems like it can be restarted and be kept going for a while. The US debt is 'only' [34th in debt to gdp ranking](  Since Japans' GDP in the 90's flatlined, it has been in this bubble limbo since the early 90's and the US' GDP hasn't even flatlined yet like Japan did before the 90's. 
Whichever bubble one believes it is, consumer debt, repos, Uber, Italy, Greece, Brexit, it is in all central banks interest to blow that bubble up again and again and again. I have hardly any doubt they intend to. With each 'pop', before it is blown up, it may see a sudden demand to liquidate in gold, bitcoin, but a lot will still liquidate in fiat with 'reasonable' monetary policies of stable countries.
Bitcoin will fare well, but still mostly on the basis of its own superior merits, and at most it may be helped a bit by 'pops' here and there.

But *per attempt*, is not really a representation of what is happening. The attempts repeat, and with each *repeated attempt,* you get another shot of guessing the right hash. It is an [ergodic process]( as there are clear statistical probabilistic properties (culminating in a 10 minute block time) that can be derived from the underlying 'hashing lottery' within the parameters of hashrate and the difficulty interacting with each other.
I guess it does feel like with each attempt your chances are equal, and I guess in a way they are, *but only in that moment of time*. If you keep guessing, eventually  you will hit the bulls eye or guess the hash, because of repeated attempts over a stretch of time.


Uncontrolled there are a lot of - you could say infinite- options to hash, but it is not uncontrolled, because the difficulty restricts the options (by adjusting the the '[target]( to make it easier (or harder) to guess the hash and to keep it statistically aimed at 10 minutes per block. (If there was infinite number of hashes, it would take a infinite amount of time to find the hash)
Theoretically, when global hashrate changes, then your portion of hashes as an individual miner is mathematically affected, but whether this is materially significant in terms of profitability or even noticeable, someone would have to model it.

Not the really the standard though, but certainly it seemed to be the aim and un-inflatability/[unforgibility]( was a feature of successful currency. The standard in a sense was that each and every time currencies would be the target of forging, diluting, inflating, [debasing]( etc. and prompting the invention of new less forgeable currencies again.
The 'free market' historically showed that 'unmanipulatable' were best for societies and economies/'the management of resources', defying a lot of Keynesian inflation theory.
To me, this makes a lot of sense, because when you have currency that cannot be manipulated, you can choose your own [time preference]( and the optimum time of when you want to spend it and on the optimum value for yourself and your counter-party. This can mostly only be good for the 'the management of resources'=economy.
Sure, you have the temporary deflationary or inflationary oscillations in an economy when people choose their own time preference with unforgeable currency.  When there is uncertainty or optimism and inventory (of both commodity and currency) is being hoarded or wasted, it is the free market will equilibrate inventory again the moment it is excessively hoarded or wasted and there is more harm than good a government does when mediating in this process. In the OP's hypothetical  stagnated world with only bitcoiners hoarding bitcoin, it will only temporarily stall the economy until it is fed back to decreasing purchasing power of bitcoin, 'forcing' its release and circulation in the economy again.
The notion that there is even a deflationary or inflationary 'problem' that needs intervention from an authority is mostly an imaginary construct.

I don't believe you discard what you have already tried, as there is nothing to keep record of what is already tried. Not that that changes the probability chances of guessing the right hash by a lot, it just means there is some chance of trying the same thing twice.
If I use the dart board analogy again, with each throw you increase the chances of hitting the bulls eye when throwing at it long enough, but there is a possibility you hit a previous result (of which the probability is small).
The increasing probability as you hash is not so much of because of discarding options, but just by [repetition of exposure]( as you basically keep throwing the dart from a certain distance and tinker with the throwing distance to hit the desired target, also in the dimension of time.

I agree with your train of thought. Applying Austrian Economics, prices are simply determined by nothing more or less than supply ***and*** demand. 
The price is not imputed by a Keynesian economists - or a Marxist for that matter - who thinks that '[price is determined by cost of supply]( or that '[socially necessary labor required to produce it]( fulfilling a central planners wet dream thinking they already know what the price will or should be.
The buyers and sellers in the bitcoin market, or any free market, are not charity givers, and do not care about how much or how little a supplier or a buyer is making. They don't care how much miners are making or how many miners go out of business. They only care about the subjective value that they are buying or selling. 
The price of bitcoin will be whatever the price the buyer and the seller agree on, as to how they see value in the bitcoin as a currency. Be it, they could see it as the next global 8T market cap reserve currency, or they could see it as a risky intangible cyber currency for computer nerds.
Nevertheless, the only reason why it will quite possibly still rally, is because of this exact hive mind Keynesian belief and is that when enough people believe it, it becomes self-fulfilling.

No it is not unique, because if it were only one unique option, then it would take a lot of time to guess the right hash, given how many - you could consider it near infinite - [hash options there are](
The options [*below the target*]( are the options for the hash solution from all the possible hashes. The right hash is basically within a selection. The selection/target is as such, that it takes about 10 minutes to guess a hash below the target. If it was unique it would take forever to guess the solution.

A lower price, very simply, is just a market effect of more sellers than buyers.
But where you may be going with it, is that it would mean that it will be harder for miners to make money, some miners may drop out and the hashrate will drop. It is thought that a higher hashrate is a good sign and generally better for the security of the network, as it means there are more miners processing transactions. However, previous drops in the [hashrate]( were arguably not of much consequence to compromising the security of the network.

It is a good thing to consider all possible scenarios, but I do think that we need to acknowledge that we're down 'step 22 of it\_this\_then\_that, if\_that\_then\_this, etc' of a conspiracy of very large proportions. I imagine that when they introduced the the US dollar in 1913, that they had to constantly remediate attack vulnerabilities in the design of the currency and 100+ years later they still are.
Just like the USD 'ossified' and resisted attacks, bitcoin will probably also follow this 'ossification' process and perhaps the only way to get reassurance that it is 'ossified' and can withstand such attacks, is for them to actually happen.

Interesting concept. Exchanging in notes is still very convenient. Could also be useful for off the grid areas who want trade with notes, but backed by bitcoin's 'monetary policy' and actually redeemable for bitcoin. Much like the times when notes were redeemable for gold.

I doubt it. I don't think there is any historical evidence that governments are able to manipulate gold prices. The fact that they needed to impose the price that is pretty good evidence that they have utmost difficulty controlling the price. Gold got attacked and the only thing they could do it set the price at $35 for half a century.
Pretty much all other commodities can be manipulated by controlling - either flooding or constricting - the flow of new product. Oil is a classic example, but also palladium and platinum.
[Because gold has such a high stock and very low supply]( its price is much more difficult to manipulate. Manipulation of gold supply - and therefore the price - is pretty well impossible, because there are exploration and energy consumption limitations in profitably mining physical gold.
This limitation on gold mining is essentially the 'PoW' of why gold is valuable and a good currency, and by design bitcoin as well, as it mimics physical limitation of energy consumption of profitably mining bitcoin (without [digging huge holes in the earth]( and has similar gold stock to flow ratios.
Governments attempting to hoard and control gold or bitcoin will only prove and demonstrate its value. However, the longer they don't, the longer it gives citizens opportunity to buy bitcoin and hedge away from the whims of central banks.
As with gold, bitcoin gives people freedom to trade, as it is designed with the inherent currency features for it.

If the *actual* hashrate drops instantly it becomes instantly easier/more profitable for other miners to hash. The retargeting down may make it easier as well, but if that is to happen then other miners will clue into it as well. The retargeting only partially has something to do with the incentive for miners to mine, and has more to do with maintaining the block time at \~10 minutes to maintain security. The actual price of btc has more to do with the miners incentive to mine.

It might work, but the margins are pretty thin because the competition to discover a trend is fierce and discovery of a trend means it is killed pretty quickly too. [A guy like this]( is an exception.
It's not like TA has an adverse effect on the market, per sé, and it may actually well add value to the market and value of the currency. Unless they are front running, spoofing etc. which puts participants off and devalue the market overall. But TA correct market inefficiencies, that do exist. The efficient market thesis is not correct.
If an egg producer sells his eggs too cheap, then a TA can quickly jump in and outbid the previous buyer, so the egg seller has more money to feed his chickens extra and  produce more eggs. In turn, this  strengthens the  production and value of the overall economy and the value currency of that economy.
Same in bitcoin, if a TA sees that bitcoin is too cheap he may buy some and then sell at higher price. The TA can then buy more assets to produce products and value in the economy. Vice versa, if the price of bitcoin is too high, it probably good to stop hoarding and sell, so that money can circulate and add value in the economy. It is just simple Austrian economics.
I don't waste my time on TA. so I don't know enough about possible trends, but for bitcoin I imagine it would be extra hard, since it is a very diverse market, influenced by so many different news flashes that a very big audience picks up on. This is probably a good aspect of crypto, especially compared to lesser broad audience and more easily prone to insider trading that trades fiat currencies.
On the whole, I am not a big fan TA as it quickly descends into just mania causing volatility. While volatility at this stage is somewhat inevitable, for the currency to keep increasing in value, volatility is not a value adding feature of a currency.

Bitcoin was built to mimic the properties of gold, so it is not entirely a coincidence that so far the model fits. But as you say, *so far.*
Bitcoin is still different than gold, and bitcoin has a different vulnerabilities or advantages than gold. You can't just rely and follow a model, and I would  encourage to really think through the fundamentals of bitcoin and the factors that influence the development of bitcoin, make sure you understand it, and base your investment decision how much confidence you attach to different scenarios.
For example, on the one hand , people seem very sure a banking melt down, like 2008, like dotcom, like 1987, is imminent and that is sure make bitcoin a top 5 market cap currency very quickly and it will be the end of fiat.
On the other hand, people may have reasons to believe that the fiat system will just be stagnant for 2 or 3 decades, like Japan has been since the '90s, and the status quo for fiat will just remain for a long time, maybe not propelling interest for bitcoin or even losing interest.
The [Japan 'stalemate economy' deflation scenario]( kind of defies the widespread notion that USD, EUR, etc, fiat will inflate if a collapse were to happen. Inflation and crazy money printing happens in countries with no transparency in money printing, but as crazy as the [money printing in USD]( is, it is not that crazy. And as the Fed is semi-transparent, I can't see it getting away with crazy printing and inflation. There certainly is inflation in western countries, but this inflation has been taking place in the upper parts of the [Exeter pyramid]( A can of coke and a loaf of bread has been the same roughly for two decades, cars are getting cheaper and have 'deflated', however, moving up the pyramid, houses have inflated and all sorts of nonsense derivates have also inflated hugely. It is the [Cantillion effect]( with inflationary and deflationary effects in different parts of the economy.  [Trace Mayers]( thesis is that in the case of a recession/collapse, the upper parts of the Exeter pyramid will just evaporate and/or seek liquidity in the lower parts of the pyramid to avoid evaporation. It is imaginable that this would create a big demand in gold and bitcoin, but fiat may actually still be in demand and deflate and still remain part of its ['cash is king]( status, alongside bitcoin and gold.
In my mind, what '*should*' happen is that the upper parts of the pyramid *should* evaporate. These derivatives are a ball and chain on the economy, in which they cream off value from economic endeavours that actually serve society such as farming, manufacturing, construction, tourism, recreation, technology, art, education etc in the middle of the pyramid. Much of the 'productive' assets in middle of the pyramid is 'locked and tied up' and [financialised]( in derivative contracts, funnelling the money to the banks and governments.
On the long term, the growth of the 'bitcoin economy' has a potential to 'unlock' productive assets again and built productive assets on a 'bitcoin economy' and on a currency that cannot be manipulated by Cantillion effects. Maintaining the currency allocated in endeavours that add value to humanity and where it is not funnelled out in unproductive derivate nonsense or governments needing to finance their wars. I suspect that many bitcoin investors would actually love their own business, and live in an economy in which it was easier to make a product or provide a service, that is directly adding value to your co-citizens and your community, without your currency or assets constantly being under all sort of monetary pressures to be financialised in the latest 'banking debt instrument' and locking your assets down or diluting your currency. An economy with a currency in which you can choose your own [time preference]( on when to spend it on something valuable, will be a lot better than currencies that are designed to almost force you to spend it with a high time preference, often leading only to expenditures of consumption only to 'prop up' GDP numbers instead of expenditures that maintain or create human value.
I went on a bit of a digression, but there are a myriad of factors that can influence bitcoins future and as an investor you need try and understand all the different factors as well as you can. The model out there is a best case scenario, but also analyse some other-case scenarios and match your investment to your level of risk you are willing to accept.

Proof of stake is proof of power and power forges or can be forged. Forgeability of a good currency should not be possible or at least very, very minimal, like gold, like bitcoin. Proof of work in newly minted bitcoin supply cannot be forged, analogous to proof of work in gold mining that is also near impossible to forge.
The word 'stake' implies ownership or share and is antithetical to the properties that make currency valuable. Proof of stake has other valuable use cases, but not for a currency.

Probably given the numerous rubbish future products out there, I am also generally not a fan of futures. However, this is mostly based on experiences in the fiat world.
For some to be calling for censorship for buyers and sellers of futures in bitcoin, is kind of ironic, given bitcoins premise of being permissionless.
In my view, buyers and sellers have the freedom to decide themselves on a future price of bitcoin if that provides either party peace of mind for whatever reason. Insurance policies, borrowing and lending rates, these are all future markets of sorts and people have good reasons to make such deals. If you're 5 years away from retirement and you want to lock in $20,000/BTC in 5 years, just to be sure, then I think that is a legit reason someone would want to sell a bitcoin future. I am sure that many here, would also be keen to snap up that future if they don't have money to buy anything yet at this moment.
Buyers and sellers of bitcoin futures can provide each other with transparency by actually seeing what's done with the bitcoin on the public ledger and this transparency should reduce manipulation. In contrast, fiat has a myriad of vulnerabilities when traded as a future and prone to manipulation. It is not transparent what is done with the money and dealers of fiat futures often have 'insider' monetary policy information that they can bet on. The monetary policy of bitcoin is open and transparent to all. Steady and predictable supply of bitcoin and a max of 21 million.
Still, as a legacy of fiat, financial literacy is unfortunately at an ATL and so people should be very wary to not buy derivatives of derivatives of derivatives....preferably just stick to buying and spending, and if you want to, buy a very simple to understand future product.

Could be. I was thinking it could have been a reaction to drop in hashrate. [
Not that a drop in hashrate is a rational reason for fud, but it I guess it is a somewhat rational reason for big bag holders to dump to bet on the anticipation that the news of a drop in hashrate *may* cause fud and then start buying again when the price is low. 
I would suspect this was an attempt to manipulate the market by big bag holders, betting on each others to [dump]( and when they all do, the price drops and they can start buying cheap again, or worse it could be front running. We won't know. This kind of trading is somewhat inevitable, and it goes either way. It may somewhat disturb the short term price discovery, but it won't have too much of an effect on the long term price discovery and the magnitude of the kind of fluctuations has somewhat decreased over time as far as I can tell.

Regulation will hardly make a difference, because of how bitcoin is designed. Namely, Open - [3:58]( Borderless - [5:02]( Neutral - [9:55]( Censorship-Resistant - [16:00](  and Public - [19:53](  and this will be good for an economy in which all people can participate.
Bitcoin is the antidote of regulation.
Regulation of existing financial systems have done exactly the opposite of how bitcoin is designed, excluding billions of people from participating, and precisely enabling the elites to cream off the top. Regulators may try to regulate bitcoin, but at the most they make it a bit more inconvenient to access and displace some economic activity to a different legal jurisdiction.
The lady's point of 'shitcoins and volatility doing damage' to the reputation of crypto, is tempting to support and to feel like like those aspect need regulation. But even if that is possible to 'control' or regulate, in my view people  have a right to learn to choose themselves what they want to try out and believe in what could work. Only by trying out, a free society can learn from its mistakes and move forward and weed out the shillers. For the record, the dotcom bubble was regulated and that crash was of epic proportions in the trillions, where the regulation manages sometimes even to protect the shillers.  The last crypto bull and bear run, pales in comparison to that.
As the SEC dude says, I also have no doubt that there could be foul play (front running, spoofing, etc) in the market 'price discovery' of crypto, but no less so than in the regulated traditional markets. I am no expert in this, but collusion and price manipulation on a traditional market seem much easier no matter how much you regulate, where stock can only be traded on only one exchange. I could even argue that price discovery is worse, precisely because it doesn't have oversight from so many people that are excluded to participate. As diversity in the exchanges and marketplace for bitcoin increases, manipulation of the price discovery will be harder and harder.

Even hypothetically, say, they mine every block, then what are they controlling? A peer-to-peer-payment network everyone in the world has access to? We can thank them for that with a few bitcoins for them processing the transactions at their expense of billions of dollars of energy and safeguarding the network. Not a terrible deal to be honest.
If they decide to pull the plug and stop hashing, joke is on them for wasting billions of dollars of energy,  devaluing their own bitcoin reward and the mining will just be picked up elsewhere in the world.

This comment has good points in it.
Anyone referring to the the mythical '[51% miners scenario']( don't understand the how the incentives and disincentives are embedded in the design of bitcoin to be balancing out.
A concept that you are implicitly describing is [unforgable costliness]( , as an important feature of a currency. Just like gold, the *costliness* to supply and mine bitcoin by miners is not *forgeable*. And just like gold the energy it takes to produce gold cannot be cheated, nor can it for bitcoin. Of course people will try to cheat, some people still think you can reverse copper into gold.
Imagine if could be forged. Forging gold - either diluting or reversing gold or massively increasing supply of gold - is impossible or very costly. Forging bitcoin - by forging the limits of physics of energy to produce a bitcoin - is also impossible and/or costly, by design of PoW. The energy put in by the miners is not physically forgable. People (and PoS) are forgable and can be coerced, but the physics of energy is not forgable. Of course people will try to cheat, thinking it is possible to produce bitcoin for less energy beyond the limits of physics, or will make attempts to control and hoard it, like happened with gold, which each and every time, made it more valuable. No one is likely to give up the energy they have put into obtaining gold, nor will people give up the energy it takes to obtain bitcoin, to then just devalue it.
Yes, PoW does cost energy, but less energy than the current intermediary of the army of bureaucrats managing fiat. And also way less energy than digging [humungous holes in the earth for gold]( or energy for that matter to support the intermediaries of fiat. The security maintenance design of bitcoin is way more environmentally friendly than fiat. That's not even going into cost of forgeability of fiat yet.
Also, [Moore's law is dying or is dead already]( Transistors are reaching their physical limits, and all mining machines will be more and more created equal and the bulk mine farmer will have less and less of technological scale advantage over the small farmer.  Hashing rate will more and more only depend on energy available. And energy sources are 'decentralised', variably available in all countries for all scales of operation, not exclusively to the bigger operator of scale. I may be a tad optimistic on this last part, but I am not pessimistic in that regard either.

With increasing hashing competition, and a relatively flat BTC price, it looks like [mining profitability]( has been going down in the last few months. Perhaps a large miner has pulled the plug causing the sudden decrease in hashrate. For all we know it could be a power outage as well, but it is significant drop in any case. That is, IF this *estimated* decreased hashrate is correct. Some sellers are betting on the fact that a decreasing hashrate will cause FUD in the market (even if there is no rational reason for it) and decide to sell, hoping to buy again when the price is lower when the FUD has arrived.
As far as I can judge, fluctuations in hashrate do not matter as much as people think they matter for securing the network. It is not hashrate that secures the network per sé. What matters more, is that there is diversity/decentralisation among miners to prevent collusion. A high hashrate means more mining, but doesn't necessarily mean more diversity/decentralisation among miners. Regardless also of what the hash rate is, the difficulty will be adjusted and the block time remains around 10 minutes.
If it is a big miner is pulling out, it may actually be good news for decentralisation, as that would mean that there is now room for smaller, more decentralised, outfits to start running again and make a profit. On the other hand, it may also give another big miner an easier chance to get even bigger, which wouldn't be good.
On a sidenote, crazy to see how the hashrate drop FUD originating from the bitcoin market has a worse effect on the altcoins than on bitcoin itself.

His example of how many currencies rolling up into one like [USD]( like the [EUR]( like the [CPA Franc]( is not analogous to bitcoin at all. Centralisation of the USD, EUR, etc is motivated by pretty much antithetical reasons as to how bitcoin came to be.
Therefore, I think it *does* matter to understand bitcoin, in order to understand why and how it is applied.  He is misinformed when he insinuates that bitcoin is governed like an Uber company or like a centralised money issuing authority. The only thing somewhat in common with Uber, is that bitcoin also dis-intermediates a middleman (banking sector), but otherwise, his examples could almost not be more opposite to what bitcoin is about.
He also conflates blockchain with *being* bitcoin. The 'blockchain' hype has very little to do with bitcoin. 'Blockchain' was never even mentioned as a part of bitcoin. What is a distributed ledger, is only a small feature of what makes bitcoin bitcoin. The 'blockchain', hyped up by other cryptos/alt-coins, was presented as the next best thing that could do anything, since it worked well as a feature in bitcoin. But just because you put [.com]( in your url or claim usage of 'blockchain technology', doesn't mean the idea is anything like the other .com businesses or ideas supported in part by a distributed ledger/blockchain.

manmissinganame is half right, but (s)he is missing this "double-coincidence of wants" point, which is not too different if not the same than the point of 'Fungibility'. (which (s)he missed on his/her own graph)
There is a centuries old saying in Dutch  'geld moet rollen', meaning 'money needs to roll' (older than the invention of bank notes as only coins roll)  and it implicitly means that money is useless when you sit on it and it should not be hoarded. They realised that the moment people start hoarding, it will self-cancel its value as it will stall the economy and its productive endevours, as it is no longer used in either a productive or valuable endeavour that give it an arbitrarily value in the first place.
Ultimately one would want to only own productive means that create value, circumvent the 'double-coincidence of wants' problem (which I make no claim is inevitable, but crypto offers a promise that that problem can be reduced) and not sitting on currencies. Currency has no inherent value, as it doesn't produce anything of value. When manmissinganame says that, "we *need* a place to store accumulated wealth", it is implying (s)he is not having enough confidence in the currency being fungible enough yet, for (s)he would have otherwise bought a value-adding endeavour with it, trusting that it would maintain it fungibility. Obviously, (s)he is banking on it that it will increase in value, but that is a different story, I am pretty sure (s)he is not sitting on it for the greater good of all of us.
I am a bit unsure on the following, but I think that in the end it will be its fungibility that will be a big factor it its *appeal* to use. The *appeal* will express itself in some value, however, it is not necessarily the same as value. Especially when the crypto itself potentially mitigates the 'double-coincidence of wants' problem and it becomes more attractive to owning a value adding production endeavour than it is to sit on the currency, and to use it more and more as a medium only instead.
I would go as far as making a hypothesis that it is governments' main business to stop people from hoarding and incentivise the 'rolling of money' its currency by applying some Keynesian economics to stimulate the spending, which has a whole myriad of other, mostly bad, consequences. But that is a digression.
That said, manmissinganame is not wrong however, (s)he is half or temporarily right.

I think we are both pointing at things that are extremely difficult to weigh in and to quantify its importance over the other and also to what timescales they apply. I should mention that I am thinking more in decade timescales.
Gresham's law may be valid, but I am not sure how this will benefit bitcoin, since crypto is (or should be) the 'good' money. Not entirely sure either if it is an applicable theory, since it has its foundings in valuation of a physical commodity that has purposes other that currency only.
Even so, if something else is valid, it doesn't invalidate that sitting on inventory by free market principles devalues. How to weigh the different market pressures of " *need higher ordinal valuation in order to increase stability, which means we need more people to hoard it* " versus "*sitting on inventory has free market devaluing effect*" would give us a prize in economics or make us very rich. Only the market in the future will tell us how the two weigh against each other.
Also it will be equally hard to say how much nominal and ordinal value will relate (hence a distinction in the first place). Knowing this would make us crazy rich again. You think that they are very closely related versus I am thinking more that once a stable nominal value is achieved, the ordinal value is up for debate.
The point about the gold (as a currency), was to allude to the importance of a currency circulating, to create a productive, wealthy economy and to create buying power for its citizens.
Edit: The following writings may help us understand a bit where we diverge.
From this I feel that you have a too strict of an application of the 'labor theory of value', and overseeing a bit that 'value is imputed by acting men'.
Here is another paper.
It is very abstract on its analysis of value and I haven't read all of it, but it makes some interesting points about 'objective value' as a subset of intrinsic value. There is some reference to a claim of ethics having an ob- or subjective value, which I think think is true for crypto; *the ethics that a persons should be free to trade without the interference from a central powe*r. This is giving is giving it value.
I should also adjust my earlier point on intrinsic value of having no value; it is much more complex than I originally thought.
Crypto must grow its market share to avoid the whale effects and achieve stability. I think we can safely settle on that. But I am not sure in the ways this will happen yet. There is a possibility that this will happen relative to other currencies over the long term. Relative devaluation of other currencies will make it harder to buy crypto and owners of crypto may need to drop the price for the buyer to be able to buy it. There may be spikes in demand and absolute valuation increase in the short term here and there, but with limiting factors on the demand through other devaluing currencies, it somewhat puts a limit on absolute increases in valuation. Perhaps I don't have a good read on the upward pressure from the demand, but I cannot necessarily see that there is a sure bet that the hoarder of now will only see its value increase in absolute terms.
Just hypothetically and to reduce the point a bit more dramatically , could there be scenario where all other currencies completely devalue through a market crash of sorts, however crypto will increase significantly its *relative* market share and *appeal*, but since there is no to very little buying power the price needs to be dropped by a lot, to get crypto circulating and get the economy going again?
Another point to think about is; how will crypto be valued, once traditional currencies are on the loosing end? The main reason why we are now driven to value crypto, is to buy our way out of traditional currency. However, once 'bought out' and crypto is fully established, it's there. Once the new invention is adopted, the old invention looses pretty well all its value, and the new invention is much 'cheaper to run'. You could argue that traditional currency is an overvalued bubble in the first place, overvaluing crypto as a consequence only for the time traditional currency still has a big market share.
I have probably accounted for a sequence of factors and not weighted them correctly and I am probably biased for a belief of success for the design of the currency for the way it is intended to be used, namely mainly as a stable *medium of exchange* without interference from a central power, with stable *store of value* being a bonus. My bias is probably that it would be good that the price comes down a bit, hoarders are incentivised to sell a bit, and that self-regulating free market forces keep the *nominal* value stable, and more currency comes into circulation and the use of the currency and its *appeal* and the userbase keeps growing and growing, so that we can get rid of fiat the sooner the better. I might be a bit too optimistic here. 
Having said all that, I will hoard too if that is a good thing for both me and the currency, if only I or someone can convince myself that I won't loose my *store of value* by a great margin and preferably it will increase.
Would be curious to hear your thoughts on how you weigh these different market pressures and the timescales of them.

Greshams law = "bad money drives out good" , *Bitcoin -&gt; good money - &gt; driven out*. Am I misinterpreting the law? I don't think(/hope?) it is very useful to apply, it also has slightly different fundamentals.
As far as I can see, both our overall logics are applicable. But our individual focusses are separated on either side of the transaction. This is probably the difference between being bullish and bearish.


I am loosing you a bit on the above and how it is applicable, but it sounds like you're describing the initial stages and end stages of a positive feedback loop of a (hyper)inflation scenario. The economy and it productivity stalls, ordinal value for products is kept the same, but nominal value decreases, less buying power and less currency circulating, economy stalls even more, nominal value decreasing even more, and then it loops into the knee jerk reaction to raise the ordinal value rapidly in a flawed attempt to somehow make up for the nominal value. After WW1, they increased the ordinal price of products to hopelessly compensate for its nominal value (not sure on this particular case, but the central bank will have likely stepped in with a response to add currency with will have had an arguable effects as well, sometimes those measures backfire and make it worse, sometimes they can have a reviving effect). Even though it had a high ordinal value, it was worth (nominal value) nothing.
Every currency ever is on a continual trend of debasement and have crumbled, so will the USD and other fiat currencies. It is just a matter of when. A little over a century from 1913 is already on the upper end of a currency to surviving its time. This sets a ceiling on buying power to buy crypto.
What will also significantly weaken the Fed is when the borrowing and lending market moves to crypto, this puts the Fed outside of the game of controlling interest rates and they ways in which they control the economy and their revenues. Interest rates will be negotiated more directly between the lended and the buyer in crypto, which will be great for free market efficiency.
Governments will become actors in crypto too, whether they like it or not, but without the option for them to manipulate and drive the currency to places where the free market would not have driven it, (wars, crazy 'public spending' ideas etc). The governments have no option but to participate at some point, because fiat is inferior and will be driven out by inventions that are more productive, which we both agree to be crypto. The only way government can halt the growth of crypto is by forms or coercion/regulation, which they no doubt will attempt to do. Even if they start their own crypto, they will be competing with outside cryptos, keeping them more honest in terms of how they decide to control the volume of currency.
Determining the nominal value and its differences with other value concepts is something that economists have written and argued about for a long time, it looks to remain difficult to determine. The more I think about the concept of value, it becomes a very fleeting concept and it is not as easy as just comparing it with existing currencies and making quick guesses on the pressures of supply and demand, or even trying to balance the two.
Although there is no way for me to refute your bullishness on the upward pressure from a quantifiable demand driving up the short term ordinal value of crypto, this sits more in the realm of technical analysis. I think at the end of it, it will be the economic fundamentals of a currency driving the nominal value. A valued currency is a currency that is circulating in a productive economy; people working, people producing stuff, people buying stuff, things keep developing in technologies within the economies, little unproductive endeavours such as crime etc. (This is essentially also where you make your bets on economies that undergird the forex currencies.) In other words, the currency circulating in productive endeavours.
I am have been trying to get a handle on economic productivity data for cryptos, say a 'GDP type' metric of the economy within cryptos, but even if I would, I think it would be impossible to filter out the signal from the noise. That noise being the dominating external economic drivers for the value of crypto, as opposed to the internal economic drivers of the value of a crypto currency. I believe that some 'GDP type' metric for individual cryptos, if it can be isolated, could be a predictor for its future appeal in usage and nominal value.
The crypto circulating in productive economies will be(come) an important driving factor in its valuation in the future in my opinion. I think cryptos that are structurally circulating in criminal activities may find some incidental short term upward pressure (in isolation, the mafia can be very economically productive), but it will be bad for that particular crypto in the long term. In the short term however, it may well be that your bullishness on the upward pressure of demand is fully justified.
I'm enjoying the convo. Even though we diverge quite a bit here and there, that's ok I think, it prompts me to think through some of the fundamentals a bit more, even though some could be rabbitholes, some scenarios could also be useful to keep in mind. If I sound bearish, I am not, but I am also not making a claim as to whether one can be either bearish or bullish in the short term. I don't understand the technicals well enough for that and how the weigh the supply and demand. In the very long term however, I am bullish for its *nominal* value, by virtue of cryptos' superiority as a currency, and here I mostly try to point to some fundamentals that could play a bearish or bullish factor that one could bet against or for.
Edit: This would be more up my alley in terms of making an attempt to value a currency.
It uses the "MV = PQ Equation of Exchange" for the following reason:


I would add one variable to that, say X. *X being the value added between P transactions*, loosely relating X to  a concept such as GDP or NPV. X being 1% is bad prospective value, X being 8% is economy booming, and an excellent prospective value for a currency. One could look at potential productive value adding businesses circulating a particular crypto in terms of how to hedge a bet.
The concept of X, is where we diverge the most I think. I think it is very important that when the currency changes hands, value is added to the products that are transacted through the currency. This is how economies grow, this is how currencies of those economies grow. When currency is hoarded, no value can be added. Hoarding is placing a bet against a speculated stocked up demand, for which one may be rewarded, but it is not adding a great deal to the intrinsic value of a currency. The intrinsic value is arguable the bigger driver for the demand of a currency.
This article I don't find very good, but I suspect many go by its assumption:
It says:


I think that assumption is ignoring many, many variables.
I stumbled on a case by Hayek as well for denationalisation of money, I might give that a read [
Let me know your thoughts.

A simple, yet powerful common sense observation, you wouldn't think anyone would need a degree for.

Seems hard to believe, but it could end up being a somewhat convenient coincidence. Regardless, this could be a way for bitcoin get traction if the USD would unravel that way. Still, crypto is very unideal for a goverment, because they cant control the supply and interest.

Its a loose -win situation against them. They would legitimize it that way so people will get interested in starting to trade that way. And the moment they buy it, they would make the value drop by sitting on it. And what do you do with excess inventory that is dropping in price? You have to it back on the market before it drops more. They would just become another actor increasing the circulation of a currency of which they can't control the supply and interest.

Interesting to hear that you think that store of value is its *primary* valuation.
I see it a bit differently, I think its primary *valuation/appeal* is based on *stability of nominal and relative value,* *fungibility,* and then *store of value*. In that order. I refer to *appeal,* because I am unsure on whether its appeal will actually directly translate into a higher *ordinal* value. I think there is a difference.
The more stable a crypto becomes, the more people will be *appealed* to it as won't be deterred by it dropping in relative value. (I understand the upward pressure effect on value of it getting appeal, but that becomes a circular argument). I am personally more interested in using it as a medium of exchange, more so than a store of value, as long as it doesn't fluctuate wildly in *nominal value* and is *stable* for the short time it is in my wallet. I and I think quite a few people will prefer to put spare currency back into a fungible asset that has a return. Stock currently being quite suitable for that. Then there is a whole category of people that you would never find on this reddit, who would only use as a medium of exchange, and just be spending the moment they receive it. Think of your average citizen. Then there is a relatively small sized group who don't have time to look for anything that is a productive endeavour and use it as a temporary *store of value.* And at last there are the speculators.
What I am hearing from you is that store of value comes *before* it being a medium of exchange. This becomes the chicken or the egg problem.  I certainly agree that for the currency to gain traction, it must have some *store of* *value, relative to* what is still the predominant medium of exchange for it to become *appealing*.
Currently I would regard the main reason why there is upward *relative value* pressure on crypto, is the interest in it to use as an alternative as still primarily as a *store of value* with the prospect of it eventually becoming a viable *means of exchange*, not controlled by central power. This is driving some *relative* *valuation,* relative to what are still traditional currencies. As it moves from being a *store of value* to more and more a *means of exchange*, I am not sure how the *relative valuation* over time will play out. I have a feeling that once it is established as a *means of exchange,* there will be more incentive to put currency in a productive endeavour with a return than it is to sit on it, which could drive down its *ordinal value*, but the crypto will nevertheless not loose its appeal and *nominal value* to be used as a means of exchange.
Just to re-iterate the point of sitting on a currency. Enough people doing this will eventually drive the price down. By definition, this is how the principles of a free market work. You sit on it, it is not being circulated through productive endeavours, this will reduce the buying power of the people who could buy from you in the first place. The hoarder that sees the buying power for his inventory goes down and it will realise it needs to sell before the price drops more. Then the buyer can apply it in more productive endeavours and the price will stabilise again. These things are self-canceling. People can sit on it for a while knowing that there is a demand for it (*only* driven by the *appeal* as an alternative, which is extremely difficult to quantify), and hope that the price just keeps increasing, but at some point it will correct, as it becomes too risky or overvalued to use as an alternative, in addition to people loosing buying power from being unable to circulate it in productive endeavours that would be able or interested in buying it.
It's *appeal* will just keep growing, but not sure on where exactly its *relative valuation* will go in the long term. The *appeal* of the invention of the currency itself way back was to exchange goods more effectively, more so than the king sitting on all the gold. The king sitting on the gold has both a low *ordinal value* and practically no *nominal value*.
Just sharing how I see it, and welcome your further thought on the importance of *store of value.*

I was reading this and found it insightful as to where things could go with a continually decreasing interest rates and the direction central banks are going. Thanks for sharing.
