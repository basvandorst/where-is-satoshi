How is "money laundering" fraud?
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:18:29
Drug trafficking is trade, and of course it is moral to profit from  trade.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:44:11
It's moral to profit by trading deposits in MtGox for money. You're not then responsible for the fact that some people *may* use the coin to commit actual crimes. There were plenty of legitimate reasons for making such transactaions, and no evidence Schrem knowingly participated in harming anyone.

I think that depends on how secure you wanted the cold wallet to be. You could set it up to take minutes, and have cold wallets immune to online attacks but that might might expose the funds to higher risk of internal theft. When you're talking about securing really large amounts of money it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to design access to be time consuming so you can verify security.

This of course happens with debit cards, but I'm not sure it's nearly as easy to empty an account. not for cash anyway. You could check the balance and then spend it in stores, but it seems like there's a lot more vulnerability for the thief during the process.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:31:28
Well the balance is visible on the block chain and could conceivably be traced to the owner. I guess you need be careful to make big balances less traceable.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:27:09
No, I think "money laundering" is a victimless crime like smoking pot and shouldn't be lumped in with actual moral crimes like fraud.

I'd be more inclined to believe this was Matthew McConaughey than Satoshi Nakamoto....
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:40:26
Satoshi can presumably prove he's Satoshi, but how can he prove he's not Dorian, or an agent of Dorian, without coming out completely?
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:05:50
Withdrawal from yesterday 1pm PST took about 17 hours to complete, but did go through at 6AM PST today.
Just now an instant buy (btw, instant buy limit has been decreased) went through immediately, as did a small withdrawal.
This seems consistent with the story that Coinbase delays in part reflected a need to pull funds out of cold storage.

Thanks. I fed the zxcvbn password strength test a 6 word diceware pass phrase which scored as 100 bits of entropy. That's higher than the 78 bits a 6 word phrase merits if the attacker is assuming diceware generation.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:57:18
So as long as he stays anonymous any protestations from Satoshi that he's not Dorian really carry no weight.
Since Satoshi would know this I think it argues somewhat (not conclusively) against the idea that the forum post attributed to Satoshi was authentic. I'm guessing it's not. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:50:07
Agreed. Of course he could have had help cleaning it up, but I've also read a number of his development posts and was struck by their extraordinary clarity.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:38:02
Of course I thank Satoshi Nakamoto, but I doubt that's Dorian.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:46:51
That sounds to me like a pass phrase with 128 bits of entropy would be as strong as a private key itself, is that right? But then I don't understand how the 160 bits in the public address is relevant.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:03:30
Yes, there's nothing wrong with that. Some laws are unjust, and this is one of them. It was once illegal to assist fugitive slaves in escaping from the slave states, but there was never anything wrong with helping slaves escape.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:23:32
Ah, so you're saying a 10 word diceware pass phrase doesn't actually give you the full 129 bit protection you'd expect because there are *other* "pass phrases" that will also get to your btc address via collisions.
So - 160 bits (13 word diceware phrase covers it) pretty much assures that your pass phrase is as strong as bitcoin itself.
Am I about right on those two conclusions?
Thanks, one last issue: A pass phrase wouldn't actually have to be as secure as bitcoin to be considered secure, would it?
Do you have an idea of the prospects of cracking a diceware phrase with 90 to 100 bit of entropy?
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:52:05
Yeah, it's not a good idea, but a fairly common practice to stall news that doesn't look good and try to put the best face on things. If the cold storage explanation is correct then it seems they only stalled a few hours, perhaps thinking they could squeak by, before they did come out with the truth.
I expect problems like this from time to time at this point in the growth of bitcoin. In buying and selling huge quantities of bitcoin, Coinbase potentially faces substantial exposure to sharp price moves and sometimes that will require that they be very careful and thus slow. They still seem one of the best sources to buy from, but people may reasonably start leaving less of their holdings there.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:36:36
This breaks new ground in the story by identifying large stashes of BTC that Gox should still control.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:43:15


They can't help but hold them for periods of time, trading isn't instantaneous. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:17:34
Okay, good to know, but if the thief somehow knows the a large balance is associated with you he may be motivated to continue with the rubber hose.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:25:34
Oh and BTW, some responses from coinbase support appeared to be chaff, just stalling without disclosing a valid issue. Later they posted on their web site that the problem was getting funds out of cold storage which may be valid.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:28:33
Is that actually a confirmation? It affirms noting not already in evidence.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:12:27
I think some of the best in depth coverage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general occurs on the indispensable podcast Let's Talk Bitcoin! with Adam B. Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos, and Stephanie Murphy. 
A week spent listening to all of the shows would be well worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:13:16
Hmm, I've seen the bitcoin address referred to as the public key, but that's visible on the block chain as soon as you deposit money, right? So I guess you're saying the address is a hash of the real private key? And I guess the real public key gets stored in the block chain with each spend? But nobody else knows the public key until you sign your first spend?
Sorry if I seem slow, but I'm learning bit by bit.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:24:55
1. Not if you don't morally owe someone that information, no. 2. I'm not aware that Schrem *did* falsely report a source of income. My understanding was that he's being prosecuted because some customers of Silk Road loaded their Gox accounts through Bitinstant. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:22:03
Could recently get 2 BTC a week, and buy it in one day. Now $1000 per week with daily limit around $550 or 1 BTC, not sure.
Decrease may well be temporary due to liquidity issues right now.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:42:52
Is there a relationship between this Buttercoin and the open source project with the same name?
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:20:36
Beyond a certain point security is wasted, isn't it? There seems no point in making your pass phrase stronger than your private key itself, and I gather that key has 128 bits of entropy. I see the value of bip0038 if you're using a weaker pass phrase, but if someone can crack a 10 word diceware pass phrase they could just as easily crack private keys directly, and that's not protected by bip0038 so I don't think bip0038 gets you additionl protection if your pass phrase is srtong enough. Maybe I'm missing something.
