Just get a smart watch then you can check the time and the current btc prices all at the same time quickly and easily 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:38:25

@_date: 2018-05-07 15:33:06
First off they work on iOS it's nothing android related second what complications exactly? 
Open App/Play Store, install watch face with btc ticker/prices (with a watchface you like), install, done

@_date: 2019-11-25 08:29:43
Ty but how do I check this? And the money is sending it just that coinbase is refunding it back..
@_date: 2019-11-25 08:22:39

Not to be rude but can you? Yours has a few mistakes/typos and it isn't making any sense to me.. Honestly not meant to be rude but I have no idea what it means 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:56:54
SegWit plz 
@_date: 2019-11-24 15:59:38
What about Mycelium? Been using that for years or is Electrum better?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:44:19
So $250 a month is what 8 bucks a day? That's what 2 Starbucks coffees a day OR healthcare? That's my point..
Curious: How many do you have a day? I don't drink it myself being British and extra fussy lol
Edit: googling "how much does the average American spend a day on coffee" leads to about $1100/year so make it about 4 Starbucks a day vs healthcare if you wanna go by actual studies etc but still not unheard of as $2500/year is only 7 bucks on a per day basis.. Very cheap imo :)

Anything btc related means half the people will automatically hate it 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:15:22
Is LN a part or bitcoin, a fork or an add-on or whatever though I'm lost... You explained what it is but explaining what a wheel is without the bike doesn't make sense :p
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:03:57
He is? Why who is he?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:35:38
Thank you makes sense now I'll reply to the original comment so it doesn't get confusing +1 :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:05:44


Exactly this ^ if it's **not** paid for by taxes it should be paid for like the insurance for cars IE. it **should** be mandatory 
It's less per month then what you pay for so many things.. I bet most Americans who complain so much about the lack of health care pay more on Starbucks or there cellphone bill per month then private health care 
Sad word we live in when a days coffee money could pay for a couple month's health care... Or a month of cell phone for a while year etc... Shows where are values lie as a society as a whole... No wonder trump won lol
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:47:05

What was that one with mint in the name? Used to buy darkcoin in there... Whatever happened to either of those? 
Darkcoin was amazing atm  and promised so much.. Really curious if they made it as I never hear of them anymore and they seemed THE coin at least when anonaminity is concerned but this was a good few years ago (I was a round when it was first announced and there wasn't much like it.. damn I loved that coin) 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:13:23
