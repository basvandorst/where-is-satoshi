They don't leave it on exchanges fool. Especially if they were around in 2013. There's a system to tainted coins. Unless you know for a fact this guy wasn't dealing with anything illegal. Then why defend him. That's not our business and up to him to defend himself or them to prove it.

These comments and others had me in tears laughing.  ������
The ignorance of these people is amazing. 
"Gold is like a wife. Cold yet valuable. A burden to carry but beautiful. You can but very rarely touch it. Bitcoin is like your mistress. Sexy yet you dont know a whole lot about her. You want to tell your boys all about her. Most importantly, you never know when shes going to betray you."
"Just put your pretend money in a pretend safe in a pretend bank in a pretend country on a pretend planet in a pretend Universe. Then only only Jabba the Hut can steal it by using the force unless you convert it into womp rat fur coats and trade it for magic beans on the black market of Romulus."
"So America is investing in a worthless Chinese electronic "mine", somewhere in Mongolia, powered by coal. with absolutely no assets and you think that Korea might take advantage of this, I'm sure the thought wouldn't cross their mind. Everyone knows that when the Chinese have made another trillion from their American suckers, this "mine" will disappear."

 Wow... go see a therapist or something
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:09:58
That's not what caused high fees. Blockstream caused high fees... and won't increase blocksize therefore causing this problem. There's a reason Coinbase added BCash...
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:26:13
You misunderstand clearly. Sending Bitcoin as a means to use it isn't buying into a market just to see numbers go up. If that were the case.. he'd of just kept it on Coinbase and be a good little holder without a care in the world. Cryptocurrency has no use if  during the time you send a transaction, the value can drop 20-50%
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:16:10
100% agree but if you do your research you'll know that BCash is what Bitcoin was pre-Blockstream fucking it up
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:19:05
He's had BTC for 6 months, so why would he do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:43:33
Veteran holders would do good to remember the white paper, the fees, etc. I'm not sure what side to be on so I only hold good alts like Cardona, Stellar Lumens and a few others. Fact is Bitcoin isn't what it should have been.  I can definitely see both sides and its hard to pick which one so I don't. 
Off chain transactions like lightning defeats the purpose of Blockchain tech. Bitcoin has left itself wife open to attack from alt coins

 Ya.. wanna know how to recognize the start of Bitcoin dying?  When people start recommending alts instead of Bitcoin ...

 Which means Bitcoin is basically useless unless you're a hodler . If you wanna spend it. Gotta keep it on Coinbase and sell it. Why keep it anywhere else when it can take days to send to Coinbase from your wallet?

I've been in Bitcoin for years,  I haven't missed the boat. I'm just not stupid enough to ignore red flags. The market will eventually have  a shift away from Bitcoin and I'm not gonna hodl when it happens.  Better to stay educated and informed on what's going on rather than sticking my head in the sand and ignoring progression. Better to know which boat to jump into when this one starts sinking. Many alt coins will have far more % gains and have already. Vertcoin for example up 16000% in one year. Many others will have much bigger gains than Bitcoin in 2018

Pretty sure IBM OS/2 came before Windows. 
Windows still adapted to be widely used by consumers economically.  Bitcoin is milking users with fees, slow and overconfident. Many companies have gone under blinded by their first to market success. 
Here'a examples of how Bitcoin fails. 
To sum it up,  he's a miner getting burned by fees after he sells his coin on Cryptopia and transfers it out
I'm not a fan of bitcoin cash by any means but that thread shows very real concerns for Bitcoin. 
Here's things one competitor is doing. 
Other coins like Cardano have far more potential too being lead Charles Hoskinson's who's like Steve Jobs of crypto.  Bitcoin really needs to get their shit together and not stay overconfident. Never underestimate your competitors.
Large and intelligent investors will not want to keep investing in something as flawed as Bitcoin when they see better tech with much lower marketcap could give them bigger returns

It's my belief through regulation as well as a much higher marketcap, the price fluctuations will become more stable much like the stock market. 
I'm sure you know, pump and dumps, buy and sell walls,  etc didn't originate in crypto. Those are now illegal in the stock market and will eventually be the same for crypto I'm sure.
Eventually, crypto won't be bought as a means to make money, but as a replacement for cash or their use cases.

Sooo you just like throwing away money? Really don't see the point in this except paying more for the convenience of having it immediately. Maybe more anonymity?

Maybe I'm wrong but governments can still stop your bank from getting or transferring fiat with an exchange.. decentralized or not. What other option would their be?  
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:37:42
Has nothing to do with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:42:47
That's the point. Today. If bitcoin is allowed to grow into its potential it will be a threat and they know that.

People pay taxes. Taxes pay for launches. USA is in deep debt.  People need a debt free country. We can't afford your socialist ideals. Socialism doesn't work anyway.   I much prefer SpaceX tech stay private to keep it out of the hands of our enemies. This tech wouldn't exist without capitalism.

 Honestly dude, I think you're fine leaving it on coinbase as long as you have a secure password. Gonna cost you to transfer it into a wallet, then back out if you want to sell it. I've also heard of ALOT more people losing their bitcoin in a wallet because they lost the info required to get into their wallet or recover their coins.

Competition drives innovation. Right now we have Blue Origin, Virgin, SpaceX and the, SLS program competing.
Before 0 competition for SLS program other than Russia, who we are buying our engines from and still buy rides for astronauts.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:40:46
I would've edited the title to fit better but unfortunately Reddit doesn't allow it. I'm not gonna delete the whole post and start over. 
I do remember there was alot of fud against SpaceX from the astronauts and Buzz Aldrin actually supporting Blue Origin over SpaceX. 
Kinda hard to find the fud articles now considering how much media attention SpaceX gets
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:01:02
There's more than that but you get the point.  I don't keep my coins on coinbase for obvious reasons
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:43:36
We already have made a dip under 3k. Apparently you missed it

So you prefer people to know how much Bitcoin you have everytime you make your address known through receiving or sending Bitcoin or do you just prefer using multiple wallets? Or is it just a non issue for you because like most n00bs you keep it Coinbase and never spend it? 
At least with a bank account,  I can send or recieve payments without letting the public know how much I have. Can send mom money without her being like..... ohhh you can afford to get me blah blah. 
There's many reasons privacy is necessary.

Right.. Because people become the bad guy when they decide to profit from their hard work and changing the world? 
You really think Elon is a non profit guy? Just because the company's aren't making a profit yet doesn't make him a non-profit guy.
You and I won't agree on this because we're clearly on the opposite side of the political spectrum. I'm a libertarian capitalist.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:48:30
I was at SpaceX the day the Falcon 9 first succeeded after multiple failures. Elon made it very clear he was out of money and that was the last attempt.. Many sold their employee stock for dirt cheap instead of believing in the company while there's very few that have never sold any of their stock who were there in the beginning and continue to buy more. SpaceX was a bigger risk than crypto back then.

You fools keep saying it's banned. It's not. Not yet. Only one exchange shutdown voluntarily. Regulators meet with the exchanges tomorrow. Outcome is still unknown. This can get worse. The other exchanges are currently up and running in China

Why not do your own research. Plenty out there..
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:48:16
It reminded me of it simply because of all the crashes SpaceX had and came back stronger as well as the fud against crypto from the old guys. Wasn't meant to be an exact correlation. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:10:49
Nothing. Actually. I've gained. Got 3 BTC. Last time I've bought was a year ago. Been buying Vertcoin lately. I'm just bitter because people think that it's going up for other reasons
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:07:35
So you just repost old videos to get views on your YouTube page? You're a tool
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:49:21
It's not over yet. Only ONE exchange shutdown voluntarily. No official exchange shutdown. Once / if it becomes official, you can bet your ass it'll crash more
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:15:09
Only reason Bitcoin is taking off and others are tanking is because people want 2 for the price of one with the fork. That's it. Period. I recently bought Vertcoin at 0.75 cents and cashed out at 1.44.  Then will buy back in soon because I believe in it. Almost doubled my money in a month.. so enjoy your small gains. Bitcoin will be like Archie the first search engine. Bitcoin will be the dial-up internet of coins. Being the first historically never ends up being the winner.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:42:47
That's the point. Today. If bitcoin is allowed to grow into its potential it will be a threat and they know that.

Vertcoin. Just quadrupled my money in 2 weeks. Good luck doing that with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:18:28

Dude. Doesn't reflect well on the alts? Jesus you're ignorant. Bitcoin is the main trading pair. Once exchanges get fiat and more trading pairs, this won't be an issue
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:27:45
They'll still provide Bcash around Jan 2018 since you had the coins on coinbase at the time it happened. So you're still good. They'll match whatever you had in at the time. Supposedly this time they're gonna be much better at handling the fork at have it available immediately. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:06:00
Regardless of that fact, it still took the accumulation of several orders. I just simplified it. A small order by itself would never make it jump $100.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:38:36
Considering recently you posted that you feel very poor around people who have 10+ million dollars. I seriously doubt the validity of your post. 
"Hrm. Yea I think I may need to get a new finance guy, or have a talk with my current one. The porfolio hasn't been doing that well, and I've only been making 60-70k the past couple years, which is underperforming the S&amp;P. I'm even considering taking control of it myself since I know a lot about investing, but also am not going to risk it on dumb bets or trying to get rich. Will most likely invest a small amount in bitcoin, and put the rest into index type funds, and probably keep a larger amount of cash on hand.
I guess since I'm surrounded by so many people who have 10-100M+, I've been feeling very poor, but like you said, that's simply not the case. I have not given myself permission to feel ok about my savings. And all I can think about is how I'm going to support myself and not draw from my nest egg.
Thanks for reinforcing this. I guess I should just come up with some moonshot goals and start working toward them. I learned enough about myself where I know if it's not exciting enough, I won't be able to start or stick with it.
I want to work with Naval Ravikant one day. In order to do that, I need to learn how to code and need to work on bitcoin. Doesn't seem like the worst idea in the world."

@_date: 2018-02-02 09:38:09
Shouldn't I be buying Monero if those were my goals?  I buy Bitcoin to buy alt coins and make money.
To achieve true censorship resistance. The blockchain should be private with cheap transactions.
It's no wonder Bitcoin is tanking

@_date: 2017-10-03 01:33:14
Because the majority of anyone buying bitcoin will look at it this way. Pretty sure no large investment groups, no one I know personally will look at a lower valued fork with lots of bad press as the real bitcoin. You can get all nerdy about hashrate, etc but 99% of the people really don't even know what hashrate is or care

@_date: 2017-10-13 01:01:16
Not really a waste if you mine an altcoin and either hodl or sell it for bitcoin. I did pretty well doing that with Vertcoin since its asic resistant and I can use a rig with consumer video cards
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:12:46
I'll match that offer plus setup CCminer to mine an alt coin for you to sell for BTC. I'll rebuild it and apply the proper thermal paste so temps aren't an issue. To the moon! ��
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:24:20
That's exactly why they invest into it. If exchanges are shutdown in the US.. Ripple at least has a chance a chance to survive under government regulation. People buying ripple are betting against decentralized currency
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:24:26
Do you have any clue how much more affordable launches are now because of SpaceX?  Clearly you don't otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.

Exchanges don't make this convenient. The majority of people I'm sure don't do it simply because is inconvenience.. And many out of ignorance, with little search if any trying to get rich quick..

Day trade with alt coins using Bittrex. More predictable and more profit. Buy the rumor and sell when theres a pump before good news happens. Example. With Cardona (ADA) it got pumped before their Japanese conference then started dumping during conference. Never buy during a pump, wait a week at least. Etc etc.  Go to  for ALT coin discussion to find ones worth investing.  Start small until you gain experience and not lose much.. you will at first but that's how you learn.
