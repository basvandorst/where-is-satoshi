Any website with a newsletter at the beginning of the page is an issue in itself. First time visitor to the site, I am frankly appalled. We are better than this.

Money is math. (Mostly) Everyone understands math; Regardless of the crypto, it will forever be possible to "decrypt" any type of math relating to money. This is no different from any currency you currently deal with. The supposed "time bomb" is apparent in any currency.  You allow others to control what you consider "worth". Bitcoin may not be the answer you are searching for, but is it the right step forward in realizing a better world in which the masses have control and not a select few.
I do agree with you on points, but we are just getting started.

Hey at least they use real cheese.

Didn't know that was a thing... Also wasn't begging.

Do we have someone on the ground that we can trust? I see that as the precursor to helping any movement.

I have no smart phone. I have been resorting to printing gyft cards. It works well, but could be better. Although with CVS I had an experience where the store manager literally asked me "Why did you buy these?". I simply answered "bitcoin".

That's a good idea. I'm unfamiliar with mycelium, does it work in the US? California specifically?
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:08:54
Sorry was busy. He's in southern California.

Frankly, I don't see how this is any different from any finite resource on the planet. You can corner any market if it is a limited item. With this being said, the longer bitcoin is in the hands of the "less fortunate" aka me, the less chance of this happening. Bitcoin is and will be a grassroots movement. Act accordingly.
