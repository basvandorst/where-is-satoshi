Which new development? 
Unfortunately my talk at Fidelity was internal only, but given that I'm CEO of Lightning Labs (lead developer of the lnd implementation) I follow all the developments closely. :P

Apparently you're talking about a few jokes/clarifications I made on a panel of developers I'm very friendly with at Breaking Bitcoin (which btw, I co-organized _as a volunteer_). Get a sense of humor.

Thanks! Either party can opt to close a channel at any time. In the most cases you have a cooperative close which should happen in ~10 min. If the other party goes offline or tries to compromise your funds, you have to wait longer (a configurable parameter) and the blockchain enforces a pre-signed contract, and then you get your money back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:53:49
That's one of the issues with software development unfortunately. Lots of unexpected things can come up and if we say mainnet in two weeks™ and it doesn't happen everyone will be disappointed.

Right now we have support for both BTC and LTC in our Lightning implementation. The cool thing that this allows for, as I mentioned, is instant cross-chain swaps on Lightning. This is a big deal for LTC as it can make trading with BTC seamless. :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:20:26
BCH doesn't have a malleability fix. Lightning as implemented needs one, such as segwit.
Bitcoin activated segwit in August, and Lightning uses it. But not all exchanges/wallets/etc. support segwit yet. Anyone using Lightning would already be using segwit.

A soft fork can't implement Lightning. A soft fork is needed to make Lightning possible in its current form, and then it needs to be implemented. We already have support in LND for BTC and LTC.
Building is a lot more fun than arguing, so I'm gonna leave it at that. :)

One cool thing about LN is you don't need global consensus like you do on the bitcoin network. The whole point of LN, and the reason it scales, is that you can have local consensus between participants that is enforced by the bitcoin blockchain. Luckily that makes it a lot easier to have multiple compatible implementations! :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:22:28

You typically want to have more than one channel open at any given time for redundancy's sake. And we imagine open and close will probably be automated for the most part. In fact we already have a feature in LND called autopilot that can automatically open channels for a user.
Frequency will depend whether the funds are needed on-chain or more useful on LN.

Actually the paper first came out in late Feb 2015. So it hasn't even been around as an _idea_ for 3 years. Ideas take time to get peer-reviewed, then designed, developed, etc.
Unfortunately there aren't that many engineers in the world that know about low level bitcoin protocol tech, let alone LN. Chaincode Labs has actually been doing a great job educating technical folks about the protocol. But it's hard to scale people in that way.
Money doesn't really solve the problem. Getting more developers who understand the tech would help a lot. If folks want to donate to educational and training initiatives, great!
And I have repeatedly said you can get involved by testing and contributing to our open source [LND implementation]( We've had over 700 volunteer testers get involved, and they have been awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:30
Nope, one of the keys to a short live interview is to figure out the points you want to get across (like why Lightning is important instead of spending the rest of the time on whether bitcoin makes sense for coffee). With a longer interview I could have explained potential use cases but this was a finance audience so I stuck with the trading angle (instant deposit/withdrawals and cross-chain​ swaps).
And thank you! :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:34
Because that's not how software development works. Lots of unexpected things come up and if we tell people two weeks™ and it takes longer, then they'll be disappointed.

@_date: 2017-12-22 05:16:24

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:14:53
I actually specifically said that Lightning is like a checking account with instant settlement on bitcoin and your on-chain funds are like a savings account. So you don't spend the savings, but you use LN for day-to-day transactions.
Also when you only have 6 minutes, better to get the most important points across. I don't think bitcoin is terribly useful for coffee. :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:19:26
Yes, and an important element of this is that since these fees are hidden from consumers, it's hard to get them to care. Merchants on the other hand would care, but they weren't the audience.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:29:12
Actually I really wasn't, I didn't even do a run through. Though of course I thought about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:18
Remember I had 6 minutes total, about 3 left at that point. While low fees are obviously a benefit of LN my goal was to explain what Lightning is to the broader audience in a very short amount of time. A longer interview would have certainly been different.
The real answer, which I didn't have time to get into, is I think the technology makes the most sense for things that aren't yet possible today. I don't buy the coffee argument, so to speak.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:05:52
I'm actually CEO of Lightning Labs.
Lightning (Network) is the protocol. :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:54:05

They would have to implement a malleability fix via a soft fork (or hard fork). I thought part of the point of BCH was that they weren't going to do this, though their plans could change.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:09:37
Ha, it is indeed extremely hard to explain Lightning to an audience that knows nothing about how bitcoin works in 4 minutes (because 2 was spent on fees!)
Yeah, I give a lot of talks in the community, have done some podcasts, and have written some articles, but we've been pretty swamped lately tbh. I will be doing some more podcasts in Jan too.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:21:43
Haha thanks! ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:49
Nope. There are 3+ implementations and they're all open source. None of the companies involved run the network. It's peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:05:26
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:26
All transactions are secured by the underlying blockchain. Because Lightning doesn't broadcast every transaction to the chain, it can be far more efficient, enabling instant, high volume transactions. The blockchain functions as a judge, enforcing the contracts from Lightning when you withdraw your funds to the blockchain.
If you don't like cryptocurrencies, though, why are you on r/bitcoin? ;P
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:13:57

@_date: 2015-06-03 20:19:18
If the cost for a BitLicense were only $5k, it would be far less of an issue. The cost for applying, compliance, legal fees, bonds, and all sorts of other things will be far, far, higher.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:38:20
There's a $2500 annual renewal fee, and you have to pay examiners $75/hour to review your case (who knows how long that will take).
But one thing that I see consistently misunderstood is that the fees are nothing compared to the cost in both time and money to pay lawyers, compliance people, rebuild systems for reporting requirements, post bonds, and many other things that it will take to get these licenses. It will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:17
We're in our last alpha release. Next one will be the mainnet beta. And no, we're not giving time estimates, but we're working as quickly as we can!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:07:34
Yup, that's the equivalent of opening a channel on LN. Luckily the more people that use LN, the fewer on-chain txs will be needed for smaller values, so hopefully it can reduce some of the fee pressure.
And a little over two weeks ago, was opening mainnet LN channels with 40 cent transaction fees, so hopefully we can get back to that soon! 
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:17:07
Application fee is the smallest relevant number here. Recently Coinbase stated that it cost upwards of $3M to get money transmission licenses in half the states, and these were the easier and cheaper states. So the cost of getting a BitLicense is at least in the hundreds of thousands if not millions.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:04:34
Thanks, that wasn't in the transcript of his speech that I had. Gotta disagree with Lawsky here, I've been working on bitcoin regulation for quite a while now and each state *is* designing its own approach. BitLicense does not give companies a license to operate in another state (unless they don't require a license, which renders it moot...)
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:29:56
If you read the bill, it will also require bonds in an amount to be determined by the commissioner. And $5k is not really what it will cost, the amount in legal fees and compliance will be in the hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:15:19
Where are you getting this from? I think you may be confusing the "dual licensing" issue where he says that you won't need a NY money transmission license if you have a BitLicense. Lawsky has no authority on other states and a NY BitLicense will not allow operation in other states.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:22:17
And you can buy a *lot* more with the hundreds or thousands or millions that it will actually cost.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:00:24
Edit: Found it via Q&amp;A, but Lawsky is being overly aspirational here. It's not an accurate assessment. Each state has their own jurisdiction, and is designing their own legal regime.

Welcome to the cat-and-mouse game that is internet regulation. And not to mention the fact that few if any regulators actually understand the very technology that they're regulating. (I have a lot of experience with this from SOPA.)
We're in agreement here, which is why I'm advocating for drastic changes to the proposed regs so that the future of bitcoin and virtual currencies in NY is not one of Tor/VPN/proxies/etc.

@_date: 2014-10-14 20:38:22
Do you mean discouraging people from starting businesses in NY, or discouraging any bitcoin companies from *doing* business in NY?
What about companies that have stated they'll have to block NY IPs if it's not substantially changed, such as Circle?

Thanks. We're also drafting up a more in-depth policy response geared more toward the bitcoin community.

(1) I'm working on having him accept bitcoin donations (the primary election is on Tuesday, so he has a lot going on right now with a small campaign).
(2) NY is a particularly strategic state for bitcoin right now given the problematic BitLicense and the bad precedent it could set for the rest of the US, and the world. Having a BitLicense opponent like Tim in office could make a real difference.
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:44:00

@_date: 2014-09-04 23:14:37
Supporting bitcoin is actually a big part of his technology platform, of which I am a committee member. That will go public shortly, but Tim mentioned his stance on bitcoin in a [talk he gave in SF last month]( and in this [TC piece](
tl;dr He advocates a "wait and see" approach to new technology like bitcoin, is a fan of decentralization, and opposes NY's heavy-handed approach to regulation.
As for accepting bitcoin, I'm working on helping him out on this. It's a small campaign with limited resources. Any volunteers?
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:29:08
(1) How people are using bitcoin in the developing world. For example, I know an entrepreneur who is using bitcoin to pay tea farmers across the world for her tea company. It's the best way right now. Investigation into actual uses instead of hypothetical ones, and the real struggles people are facing.
(2) Agree on alternate uses of blockchain technology (I am writing about this too), but adding in some real use cases for investigation helps a lot as opposed to just theoretical ones.
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:39:08
Tim is pro-bitcoin, and he's the biggest advocate we have in NY politics right now. He understands the potential and advocates for a "wait and see" approach to regulating these types of new technologies, preferring to stay in the "wait" phase. He opposes heavy-handed approaches to regulation like BitLicense. He mentioned this publicly in a talk he gave in SF last month. I'm on his tech policy committee, and supporting decentralized, blockchain-based technologies is a core component of his platform.
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:33:09


I was intentionally taking this to the extreme, but my point was that if you're a virtual currency company and you offer a *new* product, you're supposed to get permission. Arguably a t-shirt is a new product for a licensee, so I wasn't referring to the material change side of things. My intention there was to get them to, at the very least, clarify that it's a new product that would fall under "virtual currency business activity," which in and of itself is defined in an over broad manner, but right now could be construed to be so broad as to encompass something as silly as t-shirts.
Can your startup afford to comply with all of the regulations as they currently stand? Send quarterly reports with to the Superintendent with audited financial statements, collect the real identities and physical addresses of all senders and recipients, appoint an experienced compliance officer, hire an outside firm to do pentesting, get permission before releasing a new product, service, or features, and have an undisclosed amount of USD funds bonded to NY State along with an undisclosed amount on hand? Of course for the latter point you wouldn't know if you could afford it in until you were notified by NYS.

Yup, it's definitely possible. Does anyone want to implement it? :D

Well we better not tell him about Lightning Network. :p

I've been into bitcoin since 2010. ��
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:21:41
There is no lending involved, so I wouldn't call it credit. Transactions are indeed instantaneous as long as both parties are online.
A non-perfect analogy is like a checking account and a savings account. Lightning is the checking account from which you transact regularly, settling to the blockchain is for long term holdings like with a savings account.

Note that two blocks have been mined in quick succession since then but my point still stands. 
Are any exchanges even accepting deposits yet?

There's a whole list of resources I posted up top. They will answer all of your questions. :)
Also, either party can close out a channel at any time. If the counterparty is responsive/cooperative (i.e. in most cases), just takes one on-chain conf to do so.

Thanks for putting this together Please include  in the list of implementations, as that's the one by and others.
Also bitcache wouldn't qualify unless they're somehow following the LN paper/spec (doesn't seem so).

I can help make it happen! ��
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:39:15
That's correct. One person pretended to take the funds as a social experiment, and then sent it along the next day.

It's been awesome to see the community come together with all sorts of creativity to help an internet space cat. Now we just need to save one for Hodlonaut. :)
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:02:24
What if everyone showed up at Baltic Honeybadger wearing one of these long sleeve shirts? ��
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:52:05
Yup it's real, Hodlonaut controls the funds directly.
And the site explains he's already had to pay to retain UK legal counsel out of pocket (with expertise in this area). The pro bono representation is an additional lawyer.
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:57:04
FWIW that's a dev list, not a general list, so it's focused on technical issues.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:56:09
Take it up with  ;)
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:55:48
Exactly. The key aspect of Lightning's nodes is that they are *non-custodial*. Thus far, the money transmission discussion around digital currency has rightly focused on the issue of custody and counterparty risk. Lightning nodes do not fit into that definition.
One could argue that Lightning nodes are effectively analogous to packets traveling through a server on the internet relating to a bank or credit card payment. There is a bit more complexity of course, but it shouldn't fall under the traditional legal concept of a money transmitter.
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:50:46
It did start with a conflict of sorts...but agreed on the sentiment. :P
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:01:31
It's a joke. ��

Lol no I'm not actually a bot, it's a nickname from a friend years ago.
@_date: 2016-02-10 03:06:05
On the bright side, they made it available for people to read without charge.
@_date: 2019-04-28 03:05:59
Did you get it resolved? I believe there was a UI bug related to this. Restarting may help.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:00:20
We've hit $20k in less than 24 hours! 
More donations will be helpful though, as legal fees can get much higher than this. Thanks to everyone who donated thus far.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:51:32
It's not. :) Holdlonaut controls the funds and I have personally verified this.
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:11:30
But there **are** references to being custodial in many of the proposed digital currency laws, which will be the most applicable here.
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:26:05
Yeah this is an experimental alpha as we work on bug fixes, stability, and improvements for Neutrino, autopilot, etc. It'll probably be longer than a few weeks to get this all done. :P
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:07:07
Apparently it's not CC licensed but [the publisher is allowing the distribution of the pre-publication draft](
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:01:56
Good idea, will add.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:33:27
Exactly. Neutrino light client support will be included in a future mainnet beta release. We're working as quickly as we can to get it out!
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:08:13
That's true for lnd nodes, since we shipped breaking changing with the beta. We discussed it more in the blog post: 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:39:04
Yup, I'm happy about the current lull price-wise. Crazy runups are a distraction away from building the necessary infrastructure we need.
As usual, lopp has the perfect tweet: 
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:33:22
Also nodes have the option to not advertise their existence. While explorers are fun to look at, they're not a reliable picture of the network.
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:31:05
Anyone can advertise if they'd like, but for privacy reasons, we (along with Zap wallet and others) are setting the default as unadvertised, as those nodes will not be routing.
We will definitely see the stats around routing nodes grow as well.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:59:33
Lol, you're not the only one. But nope, just software development over here.
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:39:22
Indeed, it's been quite a ride in 2018. Can't wait for what 2019 has in store! ⚡
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:52:40
FYI this is our first release of lnd for mainnet. :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:46:41
With apps like this and last week's week of lapps, I'm super excited for what's to come. And we haven't even imagined all the use cases yet!
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:21:55
The title does say "testing" in it. :D
And yes, this is a UI for lnd, which is still only available on testnet.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:49:42
We're moving as quickly as we can, but still need to build out the core infrastructure for mobile. [

I'm pretty sure the morning presentations will be going back up, if they haven't already. Unfortunately we were having technical issues with the YT live stream.
There's also [a dropbox link]( with all of the slides from presenters.
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:47:25
Thanks for this clarification, but unfortunately I don't think a reddit comment will hold up in a court of law.
The risk here is that such patents could get into the wrong hands (trolls, a big corporate acquirer, etc.) and could be used to stifle the bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is fundamentally an open source ecosystem, which is why we need to be really careful with patents and how they could harm us.
As I [said on Twitter]( I'd suggest that you guys adopt [Twitter's IPA]( which does a good (but not perfect) job of addressing the risks of offensive use. It requires permission from the inventor for any non-defensive use, even when patents are passed on to other entities.
There are also people in this community working on an open source patent pool, and I'd suggest you look into joining this as well.
@_date: 2019-02-03 08:18:03
The figure you heard ($2.5M) came from a bunch of different investors, of which Jack was one.

Yup but the video was geofenced and not available to non-US IP addresses. This one is available anywhere. :)

Personally I prefer my "bitcoin not blockchain" line from the interview, but this is not too far off. :D

Indeed, we'll be linking it from the home page soon. We're still editing it.
@_date: 2015-10-02 23:40:55
Thanks for the input. We're also working on a technical summary, where most of those are covered. Will take them into account as we're putting it together.
As is mentioned in the [paper]( (p.52), Lightning and bigger blocks aren't mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2015-10-01 19:20:45
Thanks, fixed!
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:16:58


Yup, we're not arguing. So it's about 10 hours each way including transport to/from the airport, or 20 hours total. For some people it sounded like 20 hours *each way*, so I was clarifying. My point was more that many of us spent about 10 hours each way (in fact, I spent more travel time).


I'm sorry for speaking so bluntly about an event that I'm sure you put effort into. Nonetheless, it failed to achieve its goal of setting requirements, and from the perspective of moving the block size problem forward was an absolute failure. That is a fact.
Let's just agree to disagree on this one, since it sounds like we're coming from very different places here. Perhaps if you had been present, you might have felt differently. But the tone since the event has been more collaborative and more productive. 
[And]( [many]( [different]( [people]( [tweeted]( [that]( [it]( [was]( [one]( [of]( [the]( [best]( [bitcoin]( [events]( [they]( [had]( [been]( [to](
@_date: 2015-10-02 23:49:07
Okay then, I will ask the various parties mentioned and see if they're willing. If so, will get in touch with the mods.
Agreed that there seems to be a disconnect (understandable with a highly technical paper), and it would be good to clear up misunderstandings and explain things in more depth.
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:44:44
I believe Vertcoin and Syscoin claim to have already had LN transactions on mainnet. But all implementations are still in testing mode. ;)
@_date: 2015-10-02 18:48:04
Yes, these are a lot of questions. Ha.
You're making me think that maybe we should do a Lightning AMA, with etc. and we could all answer questions there.
@_date: 2015-10-06 07:27:27


Yes, this is what's so cool about waking up to new and intriguing stories every day. I feel like 10 years from now when things have really taken off we're all going to say "remember back in the early days?" And somehow we'll look back and it will be like the [homebrew computer club](
Btw, for those new to bitcoin and lightning and not yet up for reading 50 dense technical pages, check out this summary we put together: 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:42:21
Lightning Labs, the lead devs of the LND implementation, runs the blog. We're a seed-funded startup, and all the code is open source. We also have contributors and testers from a variety of places.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:51:17
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:14:48


As the [paper]( states, it is relevant. From the paper:


While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block
size increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a block size increase in the long term.
tl;dr Lightning can limit the number of txs on the blockchain substantially, but it will still need an increase. Just less of an increase than if all txs were to happen on chain.


It all depends on how one defines "truly decentralized" of course. There's a network that will be routed in a largely decentralized manner that is still being sorted out. But there is no single intermediary, or hub and spoke model.
Anyone can run a node and is designed to be open access. Some users may want more centralized systems and it's impossible to stop them (similar to how some people use hosted wallets), but the system is designed to be open access and as decentralized as possible by default.
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:56:55
We'll to link it from the front page soon..we were still editing it. Luckily a redditor spotted a typo.
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:22:12
We should probably chat more about this then, as I'm not sure we had been considering using non-lightning specific addresses. :)
@_date: 2015-10-01 08:19:12
Here's a summary we put together for people new(ish) to bitcoin: 
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:51:06
One cool thing to note about all of this: we hadn't yet put up any real documentation for `lnd` app development and people built these anyway. is working with us this summer to build up documentation resources, so stay tuned for that.
Plus, these apps will hopefully work on bitcoin mainnet in the near future given the pending activation of segwit. :)

Thanks, but I'm a she. The person who interviewed Gabriella in fact!
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:50:49
Edit: I can't believe they didn't even change the written approval portion to new products, services, activities **regulated under this law**, as much as I don't want that either. As it stands, even if you add a new product that's not financial, you need to get Lawsky's approval. This portion is trying to impose complete permission on permissionless, trustless technology and just will not fly.
Worth editing the above summary to change "notify" to "get approval from."

If you're a small startup in the bitcoin/virtual currency space, it no longer makes sense for you to do business in NY state. Lots of other states and countries are willing to be far more friendly (Australia, UK, Washington state, even California).
The hassle involved in paying the fees (application, legal, so on) for a license in one state, even with the new and overly vague "conditional" portions aimed at startups, when you're a small company with $100k in the bank does not make sense.
If these regulations go into effect as they stand, New York will see what it's like to lose out on a massive amount of new innovation. Innovation is mobile. People will go elsewhere.

Hi Mike, one of the many volunteer Scaling Bitcoin organizers here.


So we had about 220 attendees, only *one* of whom was a Blockstream cofounder that lived in Montreal. There were a few other people from Montreal that attended, such as Professors Jeremy Clark and Gabriella Coleman, and the organizers from CryptoMechanics. All the rest of us traveled from all sorts of places around the world.


In fact I was in charge of the travel subsidy program (and had you applied, which you didn't, you would have quite certainly received a subsidy). I booked peoples' flights. The flights to/from Zurich are 7/7.5 hours flying time. Yes you'd need time to get to/from the airport, but that's about the same amount of time it took for many of us from the west coast of the US with connecting flights.


I'm sorry that you feel that way, but given the vast amount of positive feedback from many of the attendees, you're an outlier here. And those people actually attended the event. In fact, the ability to meet in person and discuss issues and research, including at our roundtable discussions, was very much seen as "actual work" for the community.
tl;dr I'm very happy to see the tone that has emerged from the community after Montreal, and meeting in person really did make a difference.

Lightning sparks ICO. ;)
Jk. Eventually we want to build software services to help people better use tech related to LN, but the protocol will always be open source.

You can open a channel to receive bitcoin on the lightning network without putting in bitcoin. In order to send on the network, you need some amount of bitcoin to open a payment channel. It can however, be fairly small.


Existing wallets can and should integrate lightning when it's ready. The plan is to make it easy to integrate.


It will have an address system, we're still working on the specifics. We're also working on routing as we speak. Our ideal situation is that routing is all fairly automatic.


No, you pay to their lightning address.


When setting up the initial payment channel, you're bound by at least one 10 minute confirmation on the bitcoin blockchain. Other than that, when functioning correctly (i.e. nearly all of the time), confirmation times on Lightning should be near-instant. When clearing out on the bitcoin blockchain, the 10 minute confirmation time still applies (you may want more than one though).
@_date: 2016-07-11 05:08:08
Nope, it's a completely volunteer-run event focused largely on technical issues. See  for past iterations.
We plan to make travel stipends available for independent developers, students, researchers, and community members. More on that in a few weeks!
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:33:05
Good point, we (LN repo) should link the code! Thought it had been added, but apparently not.

Yeah they're working on getting rid of that.

We (the Lightning team) gave a talk in Milan two months ago and were very impressed with how engaged the community was there. Our Q&amp;A lasted two hours and was filled with lots of high quality technical questions.
The bitcoin community in Milan is super enthusiastic and I can't wait for this event. Not to mention the food. :)
