Oh I’ll agree that Hannity is an absolute bigot and racist who should not be on the air. O’Reilly seemed to have somewhat mellowed after Glenn Beck was fired and I don’t doubt Bill is actually smart but just a bit biased for my taste. I can say though that Chris Wallace is probably the most informed and well regarded anchors on the channel.

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:56:52
Lmao that made me actually laugh out loud man. It’s all good, I’m blown away that they paid so fast. Typically it’s a few days. It just went from 15.6-14.9 so when I see an opening and feel that the market is “stable” I’m jumping back in 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:26:15
Buy now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:56
Yeah that’s how I felt. I was laying in bed with my VR headset on watching a movie and my mind kept telling me to check the price check the price. So I did and saw it go from 14.2 to 13.1 fast so I sold and 40 minutes later it spiked up $1000. All the new money didn’t hear about the hack I’m guessing or just didn’t care

Anytime I’ve watched him he was extremely condescending and rude to his guests. He agrees and nods his head of the person is a Fox News contributor or someone that is very conservative but whenever a guest or someone speaks to him he squints and smirks like he’s “gotcha” then makes a feeble attempt to counter their point and uses out dated facts or incorrect information to scare his audience into buying gold and depends. If you like him that’s fine but I hope you do your own research and try to understand every side of a story that allows you to create your own opinion.

So many new people filling the forum with already answered questions in the FAQ.Coinbase and Gdax are the same thing owners by the same company just 2 separate entity’s. Gdax has no fees on market buys and Coinbase is more of an IOS app. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:53
Yeah this is ridiculous. I sold at 13.1 after nicehash was hacked and since last night it’s hit 16.7 now and smashing through sell walls. This is insane

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:22:29
Is that a real question? You can see any buy order and the time/cost/etc its laid out. Are you just watching Gdax? They’re great for candle watching but you can’t see confirmed purchases in detail just lite amounts and cost and the average per buy or sell.

I had made a very significant profit and Nicehash had just been hacked for $60 million so I expected to drop back to around 10-11. I wanted to sell it and buy back in with more cash and own more btc in the dip and watch it climb. Now it’s at 16.9k. No worry’s though, I made a nice ROI so now my greed is kicking in. I was lucky when so few are. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:38
That’s exactly how I feel, made a shit ton off my initial investment and sold all my coins. I just made more in 1 sale then I’ll make all year from work. Thankful I was smart and lucky but that extra 2k per coin would have been nice. HODL

 I’ve been a proud proponent of the market since 2013 and I’d love to see crypto hit a $850 billion value again but after the massive spike and fall last year and then subsequent scams and market fraud that have killed so many investors I fear mass market acquisition will never happen again. We may see a rise here and there but sadly they’re usually followed by fraud or legitimate corruption within the community. Millions of believers are being hurt by the small percent of greed that sadly follows most good ideas. Good luck to all the current or future investors.

That’s a fuckin genius way to appreciate wonderful street art as well as give life and beauty to dirty roads and subways. I feel like this should catch on. Imagine artists globally being aloud to tag walls legally and just add the QR code as an”tip” jar, using safe paints and dyes would remove the stigma of any aerosols or harmful fumes in tunnels or subways. Is this already a thing? If so I’d appreciate links or links to one of a kind art you appreciate.

Well blink 3 times and you’ll realize you’re watching an exchange site. Look at pending transactions on Blockchain and the buy orders are all over the place 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:05:32
It said they were purchased at $4389.02 and they will arrive in 8 days. So does that mean that in 8 days I will receive the coins and that they were purchased for 4389.02 or that I placed my order at 4389.02 and they will actually buy the coins in 8 days at whatever price the market is then? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:37:11
My apologies o confused coinbase's fees with another similarly named site that charged 21%. All is taken care of and I registered with coinbase and will begin my crypto journey. Do you recommend using coinbase as a wallet or transferring my bitcoin and etherum to blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:10:24
Buying, I noticed the price was in a valley so I decided to profit and bought the 2, now it says they will arrive in 8 days. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:52:25
Yeah I understand that they're reversible and coinbase has insane fees for transactions regardless of whether I'm buying $1's worth or 10k. 
What's your step by step go to guide?

Yeah I made an update on the 20th it came through 
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:33:01
I've been wanting to buy bitcoin forever but anytime I begin the process of looking where to buy it just becomes overwhelming. A lot of shady sites or reviews of shady practices. Most won't take cash or card so I have to buy another currency in order to purchase bitcoin, etherum, NEO etc. I have a blockchain wallet setup. Looked into multiple sites to buy from like local bitcoin, coin mama. But again either shady practices or practical way to purchase the coins... where can I go to pay with my PayPal or cards online for coins that are reliable and trusted?

Forget the above mentioned mem pool, that was brought up for another reason having to do with delays and the fork. To answer your question though, at the time of sale I used the App and went to the sales page. Typed 1.0 btc, the same as I’ve done many many times before and pressed sell. I was given confirmation on screen and email that it went through and would be delivered by the 20th. Again I completely understand that it was a hectic week especially with the dips, fork, 200k new users weekly etc plus the weekend was coming up so I put off thinking about it. Especially since every time I’ve sold it’s takes 10-24 hours to get the cash in my bank. Oh and yes I checked the transaction to make sure it was sent to the correct account and it was. It’s early AM here so I’ll wait another 48 hours before making this a big deal. I just do not like reading all the disturbing reports lately of coinbase “missing” transactions and giving 0 customer support help. Over at r/coinbase its chaotic with issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:41:38
No, I had X amount of BTC on coinbase already bought and paid for (HODLER) and decided to sell just 1 BTC for Christmas shopping. Normally once I put a sell order in I typically receive payment within 10-24 hours in my bank account. Btw I’m in the US not abroad as I know that can cause issues. Knowing the fork split had come and how coinbase was slowing sells and buys and also that the weekend was coming up I figured it would take 24-48 hours maybe. Especially after watching the Mem pool spike with orders once price fell and everyone decided to buy the “thanksgiving sale” on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:05:06
Since first investing and learning about the Blockchain technology I’ve been telling everyone to read up on it and invest. Hell I said this this to atleast 4 people yesterday. Is it risky?

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:56:29
My main concern besides the fork itself is how they are limiting buy and sell for 24 hours before the split. Some people in CB that don’t move coins may watch a lot of ROI tank. 
Edit: also they don’t say exactly when we can trade the new coin and with their track record of bcash some users may be holding worthless coins for awhile.

@_date: 2018-03-07 22:55:49
This is clear manipulation. It steadily climbed sideways from $8k-$11,700 and yanked towards $9k. Certain investors are attempting to derail crypto before it even has s chance to become viable to more mainstream users. I can’t wait until these assholes get ousted.

Most players who’ve been here for awhile will agree with this. Although it’s always good to just be cautious. To the weak hands just do what you feel is right but understand the consequences and make an informed decision based on proper research, market trends, and your own gut. Sadly unregulated markets can be manipulated by assholes but you can also make money and respect the idea of Blockchain and how it can actually be positive.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:36:39
No,no,no I’ve been vocal about both the bull and bear market manipulation for months. BTC can sustain $5-$10k as an investment or commodity just with basic market economics. I won’t lie I enjoyed the run from $13k-$19k but the fact that in 1 day we were seeing $7k swings was insane. The current manipulators are not simply doing this to make money but rather to attempt to ruin the crypto market in general.

Yes and no, basic market economics would put up a high and low wall that moves according to market usage and daily purchases. The issue is how easy it is to manipulate market prices. I’ve written a better explanation above this for another user. Honestly it’s just money men allowing dips to frighten weak hands so they can pick up the pieces and continue making profits.

It’s true and sad as hell. Like I said I made my money back plus plenty of profit but I feel horrible for the investors who bought in after 17k and put in their life savings. Imagine being the last guy on gdax at $19,850 just before the dive down to 13k. Fuck the market manipulators and I hope Roger Ver chews lead once his manic depression gets the better of him

This pump and dump is becoming a joke. No wonder major usage has dropped nearly 70%. Once the price hits 13k I’m selling all my crypto and re investing in futures. I don’t care if I lose 4K per coin. The crypto market will be devolved within the next 12 months
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:38:01
I always notice once BTC starts moving up, the amount of people in the sub jumps from 9-10k to 13-16k and almost all are the “Redditor for 3 weeks” guys just spewing SELL SELL SELL FUD. Then the price does go down a bit and they disappear and everything stabilizes. This cycle has been happening for months now. I wonder if they are part of those large sell groups that all pool cash and raise the price meanwhile spreading misinformation making weak hands sell cheap then they dump the market for profit and could care less about the actual idea of Blockchain.

I’m getting real sick and tired of these daily whale price pump and dumps and market manipulation. For those of you who love it so you can make a few bucks you’re the ones in it for the short profit not the technological gain Blockchain can be and it’s going to destroy this creation. Shame

I didn't mean was it safe regarding use but rather was it safe to hold btc in the app when it forks
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:16:38
All I see is the same people saying dump and FUD. These are the same people that complained when it was going up and they were panicked.

Is blockchain safe?

This dip is from weak hands. It steadily climbed to $11,700 but every $50 people kept calling a dip trying to freak out weak hands and finally a few at the top decide to sell and then the weak hands cash followed by the fudsters in these forums. Now it’s people in the comments saying “it’s gonna hit 7k” trying to sound smart but really just burning the foundation of crypto looking for karma... I made my profits and the rest is just money but this is why adoption will be slow

Redditor for 4 weeks... how new are you to crypto?

Guy I’m 29 and actually I thought you’d laugh. Pull the bug out of your ass

Keep an eye out for active users in the sub. Every fucking time the active users go above 10k the price of bitcoin jumps wildly or crashes. I’ve been watching this since October. Earlier the price was $8200 with 6000 users here then it went to 11000 and the price fell to $7800 in 15 minutes. 
It was the exact same when it went from 12k to $6k and every other time between. You’ll also notice a massive spike in users with fresh accounts under 1 month start active posts or comments that try and create fear or attempt to shit on other users for asking questions. It’s as if a massive group of people are actively trying to manipulate the current price or Bitcoin. Who coulda seen that coming...

You mean banking on obvious market over at tia point?  The mods already made money and are laughing while trying to find a way to remove my posts again for the 19th time.

My post history on this sub has always been positive. I’ve owned bitcoin since 2015 and been in the crypto world since 2013. I believe in the technology and enjoy its uses but I and many others are worried about market manipulation and unsustainable patterns that cause the market to fail. It doesn’t always have to be a bull market (although I love it) but when a group or groups of investors try to hedge the market and kill it you will feel the same way. Todays been positive but just stay weary of a bull trap. The pullback may be around 8100-8200 with current buy and sell orders.

It’s a trap set by bears to catch unsuspecting investors. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:25:27
Hey whales how about pumping BTC to an ATH again so we can all pull out of this shitstorm. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:49:54
Annnnnnd here come the fresh alt accounts to try and downvote or spread BS about how I’m wrong... you’re right guys no market manipulation at allllll
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:34:21
Or maybe it does what it did and hit $8400 and tank to $7900 without reason after perfect systematic growth from $6700-8400.... try again Redditor for 3 months

The markets filled with so much pump and dump now that even guys like me don’t trust the market anymore. Another great piece of tech ruined by shady hands. Oh and for the alt account shills that will try to write strategy about my post. You’re the reason why it’ll be dead within the year. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:01:29
Lmao on Coinbase baby. Been in the game since 2013. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:16:17
Yeah I figured some bitch would say that. I want it to climb to 20k but common we all know the whales are in charge and won’t let us be happy until they either make ridiculous profit or destroy the market cap.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:29:06
^^this. Excellent app
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:42:16
Actually I was numb drunk when I saw this you leech. I worry about this market. See my posts and comments for proof 
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:25:04
So much positivity. That makes me so happy to see here these days, after months of hate, trolls, just random drama. I’ve been with bitcoin and crypto since 2013 and honestly believe in the tech. Sadly though I didn’t pull all my investments in January and I’ve been at the mercy of this market since then. It makes me weary of this bull run. I want it to keep climbing with stable numbers but I feel a bear trap is coming. I’m not sure who or what group is doing these market moves. I’ve heard more and more accounts of closed off investor groups manipulating prices and banking profits on our pain. We need to fucking fight these assholes. This is our future and our livelihood. I’ve also been day drinking.
