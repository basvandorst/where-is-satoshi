If I am keeping my coins on GreenAddress am I safe? The last fork I kept my coins on coinbase and was fine but I don't want to send coins back to an exchange just to resend them to a wallet after the fork.... AND obviously do not do not do not want to loose my coins. 
Thanks for your knowledge!!

Why does the SD only hold the data for 1-10 years without powering it???

I'm just riding out the dip. Do you think it'll go below 3k?

With GreenAddress do you have to log into a computer to change your processing fee? Every time I try to put it down to economy it still charges the same amount

 I sold all my etherum today as well. With the semi burst of this bible due to such a crazy spike in price I know that it will bounce back but it's going to dip for a while till the market stabilizes

So exactly what does this mean?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:32:36
I'm curious as well. I have a green address but haven't sent my coins over yet
