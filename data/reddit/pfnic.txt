I recorded this video probably 10 times and half the times the camera wouldn't capture anything, so to see flashing lights made me happy. When I get my laptop, I'll be able to record a better video and hopefully explain why I did this.

Clear out all the cached files and try again.
I think the database may have broken when you ran out of disk space(maybe?).

I've got friends who've pre-purchased as soon as it was available. I've heard them getting emails saying they will ship out soon (within a few weeks). So, I know it will happen...just don't know how soon.

This was the first night to have them all up and running. It's sitting on top of a firewall I was working on, but the motherboard died. I took the 24 pin power from the board and used it to power the USB's. I think there are screws holding it in, so I should be able to take it out and build something to house 3 CPU fans and create some good flow.

People whom are afraid of this should look into the proxy function of Bitcoin Client. Look into  (127.0.0.1 4444 http) or  (127.0.0.1 9050 socks) to proxy over.

I heard about it when I was looking into protine folding when PS3 had an update on the menu about Folding That was when Bitcoins was more of an idea, and people where using CPU's to generate coins. I tried to download the wallet on one of our servers at the time and tried to generate some coins for myself, but couldn't seem to figure out why it never gave me anything and maxed out all of our resources. So, I deleted it and moved on. Few years later, I heard about Bitcoins on CBS in the morning (I only watched news because of my parents), and they were talking about bitcoins being worth $30 each. That's when I buckled down and started really trying to understand what all this mess was about. I found ways to earn some btc by working on projects, but finally invested $700 in a BFL BitForce SC (1GH/s). Took forever to finally get it, created about 5 coins and then it just...stopped working. Now, it's more of a novilty. I don't even want to get it fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:49:02
Just wanted to add that this was the easiest $600 I've ever spent. Sorry for the potato-quality, doesn't do this equipment justice. The only down-fall about this is it overheats, but I haven't noticed anything gone wrong (first 24 hours with all 40 running). Shipping was an honest 3 days.
I'm going to hold back a bit after I get my next 10x miners (9 to finish off the board, and 1 to show friends/family how the whole mining for bitcoins works), and hopefully get enough people to understand how mining works to get them to invest in their own.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:11:12
They have never been on-time for anything. I've watched it from the beginning when they first announced what they where going to do (with selling Bitcoin Mining Equipment). They've promised dates and then pushed them off.
Mining is to the point where if you get into it, do it to learn...don't expect to make any money from it and you will earn coins (eventually) on the side. I've thought that if you where to start mining now and the rate increases, then it would of been beneficial to just invest in mining&gt;bitcoins and then just hold.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:21:08
Just a few days ago, I dropped ~3btc ($600) in mining equipment just to play around with some ASIC. It's no longer about profit for most of the old-school Bitcoiners, it's time to sit back and have fun.

[Bitcoind API/RPC](
[Magento Bitcoin RPC plugin](
This should help you get started. I'm not sure if you have full access to your site and ssh (or seperate vps [highly recommend to setup Bitcoind on it's own]) to install Bitcoind.

This is the same idea as what the new [Coin]( is. All it does is place more things in the way that can break or be tampered with. Bitcoin is amazingly stable and proof-of-work makes it perfect by itself.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:38:42
I would suggest waiting till BTC drops again, or else you will need a MUCH bigger window than 60 days to garantee that you will profit.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:27:03
Bitcoin has many related sites, thus requiring multiple accounts to manage. Look into [Yubikeys]( with LastPass (Password Manager). I bought one back when MtGox first started selling them, but they only worked with MtGox for that specific account. I loved how secure it made me feel, to know that someone would have to have my key and my passwords to login. Using Yubikey + Lastpass means they would have to know the login and have your key to get your passwords. So, I carry a few of the keys for different projects depending on how secure I'd like to be.

Good news for investers is that China's main exchange is down, so I'm sure pricing will slowly crash within a week to around ~210 USD if their main site doesn't come back up soon.

I found myself on a 24/7 Bitcoin binge for about 2 years. After the last crash from $250-&gt;$100, I moved all my coins to cold storage and just walked away from everything.

First thing is to start watching the markets.
Take some time to also read the news/forums, and try to predict events that should happen. The more you predict, the better you will get. I've been guessing how I think the market would move for a few years now; the hardest part is guessing that it will crash. After you get over the "dip" (when the market heads south) and get the guesses right, you can start to learn how it should move. News will help make your predictions more accurate.

I've made many predictions on IRC in the BTC community and haven't been wrong yet. (I predicted the first $30 plumit to nearly $0 but still positive followed by a rise to at least $20 within a few months) (I also predicted the crash of $250 to go down to $25[ended up being ~$50] and settle for a little around $100 [didn't expect a major country to pickup on BTC so quickly]) So, I come bearing another prediction.
As you can see, China's popularity in BTC is quickly growing. There should be plumit soon in CYN (once the average trade reaches close to 2000CYN), but once more people pick up and the volume for bitchina's CYN gets close to doubling MtGox's USD, there will be no doubt in my mind that BTC will trade in USD at low of $750.
For this to happen, 1 more major website for the USD will need to pickup BTC and at least 2-3 medium size buisnesses will need to pickup BTC under CYN.

Watch the prices from a distance for the next few days but hold. Don't sell out! Things will be bouncing very rapidly until everyone has at least SOME bitcoins. In the exact same way Facebook became popular. Mark my words, buy up as much as you can and hold the fuck on. The perfect song for this situation. [DJ Fresh - Louder (Flaxo Bootleg)](
My prediction is Indian will start picking up speed causing another ripple, but not as big as China will. Oh, man... china is going to go crazy soon.

1. You would need to find an exchange that trades BTC for the currency you'd like. I wouldn't suggest Paypal, but if you want there is [localbitcoins.com](
2. BitMinter Client (mining program) is designed to specifically work with their website/pool. This is the easiest way to mine for coins. (If you want an explanation of why, just ask :)).

Depending on your monitary transactions, you could either setup bitcoind to listen for transactions so you don't need to use a thirdparty for your BTC.
Other than that, I would suggest BitPay.
