Here's how Trezor uses your recovery seed to generate your accounts:  
This protocol is open source and there are many services you can use to recover your wallet outside of Trezor software.  Here's an example: 
I think the entire internet would need to go down (then you couldn't access any 24 word seed converters.)
Someone, please correct me if I'm off on this.  Still figuring this all out myself.

Is there any app that tracks whale buys and sells across different exchanges?  I am fascinated by watching large orders on Gdax.  If no site or app exists, can someone create it for me?  We can call it whale watchers.

If the falcon heavy explodes, we are going to get a massive amount of bitcoin analogy gifs.   Hopefully to the moon!!  Can we change the target to mars if the launch is successful?

So the only reason for using seed words is that its easier to write down?  Seems like 12 words is about the same number of characters as just writing down your private key

I'm looking to move to a cold wallet for the long Hodl.  I do not understand the reason for seed words if the assumption is that you won't memorize them.  All the guides I have seen say to write down your seeds, why not just write down the private key address?  Obviously, seed words would be easier to memorize, but whats the point if you're just writing it down on a piece of paper with no intention to memmorize?
