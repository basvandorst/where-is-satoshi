Sorry to hijack this thread, but I get how Bitcoins are digital, you can have a digital wallet running on your computer and all that. I can see how you can pay with Bitcoin in an email-like fashion.
But could anyone ELI5 me how to use Bitcoins in the physical world? Do you need to carry around a computer? Do you have to keep a seperate wallet on your phone, where losing your phone, or accidentally wiping your SD-card means losing your money?
I'm genuinely curious about how this works :)

So how would you actually *do* the payment? I still don't get it ;)

Ok. That makes sense, although it's clearly not as straight forward as using a credit-card.
Thanks for the hand-holding :)

When your currency [looks like this]( you know you should always keep one hand close to the sell-button.
It's gonna burst sooner or later :)

They should primarily accept donations in currencies backed by countries which is firmly against software patents.

This makes me so sad I (accidentally) nuked my wallet with around 0.025 BTC in it.

I stopped using DropBox once it was clear that they were in on the whole Prism-thing.
Now rocking owncloud with a 2TB account.
