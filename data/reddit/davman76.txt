I’m trying to understand there motive, I do have account with them, yes I did loose most of my capital by listing to this chick and  it sure yet if I can withdraw what I have remaining there. I have notified HK police but no response have notified scam agency’s here in Australia and no response contacted the NFA and to my surprise goldenday are. It a member even though there website says they are. Do you have a image of this woman you delt with?

I have just gone through this but not through dia. I’m still confused on what’s happened. What this poster said is almost textbook to me. I opened a account I sent some money added more money and more again, invested 50k usd. Made another 15k in 4 days with her help then a few days later lost everything including al my capital in a bad trade she suggested.
It all points to a scam but if it was how is goldenday involved? Is it possible they can only steel your money on a bad trade? So she worked me till that point.
She says she lost 300k, I threatened to take this to federal police but still plays sincere. I reported anyway. But she is still there has not cashed in and run and was also a long game. I just don’t know what to believe.

The form is on there site, seemed standard to me as any trading broker asks for similar information to prove identity.  To post pictures they need to be hosted on another site, I’ll link below but if it’s a pain in the ass then any chance To tell me the wechat i.d? Just want to make sure that if it’s the same person even though that’s easily changed. 
Mine was a long game as well which is also why I’m sceptical on what’s right and wrong. Maybe my big loss was just one of the many fails people make In forex.
