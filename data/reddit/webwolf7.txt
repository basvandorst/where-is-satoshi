Perhaps it's just similar to "HODL"!

Well, that's no good! I'll just have to back up elsewhere.

If you are willing to try to give Linux another shot, BAMT (Literally standing for Big Ass Mining Thing) is a x32 only USB-flashdrive based Linux Distro that is super easy to set up. Check it out at  I have had mixed results with it myself, my motherboard does not like booting from multi-partitioned USB drives, but perhaps it shall work for you!
If you are still looking for dummy plugs, check again for how to make them with the VGA adapters, its quite easy. The ones I have use only 1 resistor, and you should have the adapters laying around from when you got the GPUs.
Hope I helped. Cheers!

Mt. Gox + Dwolla is super easy to withdraw from, I'm mining and pretty much just selling bitcoins. Is Bitcoin-24 easy to withdraw from as well?

DAT AXIS LABEL. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:05:33
tl;dr: Yep! You have to "accept" it first, via the bot, giving it your address to withdraw to.

Geez, that's quite a chunk there! Thanks, I appreciate it!

It is probably because of your username.
