I still want my 0.01 back. Your site was still running when I withdrew my coin and continued to run for another 12 hours or so. If your site wasn't a scam it would have paid out when I clicked "withdraw". One would think so, anyway.

Okay riddle me this. How were you offering a 50BTC jackpot on your site? To me it seems that there never was 50 BTC so you were promoting your site on false pretenses which I'm sorry to say is a scam. You claim you lost a couple of thousand dollars. So you lost what 2 or 3 BTC?

@_date: 2013-12-09 01:34:12
What is the actual website you sent them to? Most sites simply "archive" the address when you press "request new deposit address". Your new address is derived from the same private key that your original address was created. For this reason you can get your bitcoin back because you still own the private key for your online wallet. Email the admin and explain what happened and I'm sure you'll get your bitcoin back.

Cash out half, keep the other in cold storage and never touch. Do this with every payment. 
If you can get by doing this now, the worst case scenario is one day Bitcoin tanks, but you won't notice anyway because you've been getting by with the money you have. The best case scenario is Bitcoin has continued to grow exponentially and you've got yourself a nice little nest-egg tucked away.

What if you found a bitcoin address that had coin in it and then crawled Directory.io until you found the corresponding private key? Surely they can't have generated EVERY possible private key? Right?
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:20:58
That's what I was trying to figure out. If those keys were pre-generated it would be trivial to write a script to crawl that site trying to match known bitcoin addresses with matching private keys. It just seemed too easy.

I know how SHA256 works. That's why I'm asking. I mean in the context of your puzzle is it important. The clue you gave before can be rearranged in a couple of different ways. "Post need you that in everything the original is." becomes "everything that you need is in the original Post." While linguistically correct it isn't grammatically correct. I'm assuming you mean that "everything" I need is in the original post so don't change the grammar or punctuation. Is this assumption correct?
 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:38:20
Sure you could try that, but, PayPal could then put your account in a negative balance and issue debt collectors to recover the money. This is assuming the buyers account is a stolen PayPal account. In my opinion I wouldn't risk it. You could lose your bitcoin AND end up owing money.

Bitcoin is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you
choose to go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, "Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid -EVER- because, this is just a ride."

The Devil needed a way to make more money. He'd been told his whole life that "money is the root of all evil". Naturally he wanted to be even eviler. 
He came up with an ingenious plan to start his own currency and make a ridiculous amount of profit. Knowing that the world would never accept his plan if they learned it came from the depths of hell, the Devil disguised himself as a human and called himself Satoshi Nakamoto.

Good luck! So, everything worked out?

I would advise everyone not to give to this "charity". A static webpage with a bitcoin address making vague claims is all this is.

So has anyone found your treasure yet? Is the answer within your OP? I've changed my mind. I want that cup of coffee!

Doesn't anyone use the search function here? This question has been asked 100 different ways before. Search "arbitrage", you're welcome.

Look at computer viruses and antivirus technology. As one advances, so does the other. The same will happen with Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be stolen, new measures will be created to prevent theft.

Like I said I'm not familiar with BTC-E, but if the API allows you to send bitcoin directly from your account then yes it's very possible. Your API key may have been copied from your bot. What device is your bot running on?

Looks like you've found a niche that needs to be filled then. Quick! Get to work!

Didn't you read his story? He doesn't have 2.88BTC anymore, but he found an old wallet with 1BTC in it.

Alls well that ends well :)

Become a gangster in 3 easy steps:
1. YOU buy the bitcoin and pot for her
2. Add a small fee (in bitcoin) for your troubles
3. Profit!
When you are rolling in dough in about 6 months I expect a cut.

Can you post the address? I want to make sure I am actually playing for a prize here. I'd hate to find out you've been trollin OP ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:19:49
Ok got it, thanks.

Copy the wallet.dat file (or whatever it's named) to your new harddrive. Open with Bitcoin-QT. Simple.

The site has:    904625697166532776746648320380374280100293470930272690489102837043110636675 pages. 
Each page has 128 private keys. Surely some of those keys are ~~valid~~ in use. Is this real life?
