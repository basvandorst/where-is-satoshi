My understanding of the blockchain is still a bit sketchy, but I feel that this is a worthy question to pose: if the husband had a Bitcoin balance at the same address at the time of the BCH fork, wouldn’t OP also have access to a BCH balance equal to the BTC balance at that time?

Hey man, not the place for this. Also, the ~0.133 BTC is only that which OP has discovered thus far. There could be balances of other currencies on the Ledger.

Hey man, be cool. If a religious person truly and genuinely prays for you regarding a tragic situation, shouldn’t that be thought of as a kind gesture by anyone, whether they’re of the same religion, a different religion, or none at all?

Relevant username. Well, in the latter case, at least.

You sound like just the right type to go found a micronation!

I don't know that I've ever really considered it this way. Duh—Bitcoin was developed to be a currency after all. Thanks for another reason to HODL!

Screw the medical and pharmaceutical industries man. Sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing better physically since then!

Cool. I've pretty much always managed my cryptos with online services; don't have much experience with local management. Thank you for your response!

That makes me feel better. Thank you for your response!
