   Dear (Merchant's Name),  
  
   I am reaching out to you in the hopes that you would consider accepting Bitcoin as a payment option for your services. If you are unaware of what Bitcoin is and how it works then please refer to this site ( for detailed information or ask me any questions you may have. By accepting Bitcoin, you are ensuring that your business will stay competitive and relevant for the years ahead but also will ensure that the way you do business now will be more profitable as there are nearly zero transaction fees associated with Bitcoin. Not only that, but customers are more savvy these days and demand more payment options. In a world where exposure is cheap but loyalty is expensive, I would hate to see you lose business to a competitor for the sole reason that they accept Bitcoin and you don't. If there is anything that stands out or anything you are unsure of then please don't hesitate to ask me and I would be glad to assist.   
  
Thank you,  
  
(Your name here)

I just came across this now but as someone who made their first Bitcoin purchase the other day and drinks way too much Starbucks, I'm stoked!

You've got a kind soul. You don't have to do these things but you do and for that I commend you. These charities and goals that you support help make the world more beautiful every day. Keep it up my friend. 
Edit: I want to say that regardless of the tip or not, you're doing a good thing. I would have just as much nice things to say about what you're doing even without the carrot of free bitcoins dangling over my head. Good luck!

Your good karma will not go unnoticed and will multiply. You're doing a good thing.

I just set my mom up with a wallet so I'll be using this tip to send it to her :)

bitcoin means putting the power back in the hands of the people. As someone who works for a bank right now, I am sick of them raising prices across the board and parading it as "good for the customer" and then boasting how this is their most profitable quarter yet. I see people being ripped off all day in my little cubicle-farm call centre, and I wonder if all the stress is really worth it? The ways banks operate as a business, employer, and provider are all old school ways that are bogged with bureaucracy. Any innovation is beat down with a stick unless it fits the agenda of the moment. Even as an employee, I have never felt like the bank was on my side. I can't wait until the people have an option that will really make the banks sweat. The future looked very bleak until bitcoin came around.

I'm starting a business and am new to Bitcoin. I could use some personal charity. I plan on utilizing Bitcoin in the physical world with my new venture but I haven't gotten started with it as I don't know the best way to purchase them in Canada.

I am intrigued and interested.
