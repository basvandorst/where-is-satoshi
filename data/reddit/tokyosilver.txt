Nice. I do something similar for my niece, too. And, I actually think the second coming of Jesus is Satoshi. 
Revelation 3:12 (King James)
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.

Yeah, last time he came, the wicked nodes refused to accept and confirm. That's why we've been on the wrong chain for the last 2,000 years!

haha, agree. my insurance package is a lot more difficult than Bitcoin, too.

Cannot imagine Wall Street buying these.

Don't worry, we are much losers with JPY! 
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:03:22
When can you support JPY display? I am Co-Organizer for Bitcoin Tokyo Meetup and converting new bodies one by one. 
As you may know iPhone market share in Japan is the highest in the world. (70%) Newbies needs to get some coins in their iPhone not in a Web Wallet.

hahaha, that's a good one!

Gold actually never circulated as average people's money for everyday transaction. Silver did. So, the comparison should rather be with silver, IMO. 
Both gold and silver has been money for some past 5,000 years and likely so the next 5,000 years. We don't know if Bitcoin will good be store of value then. 
Silver is the best electrical conductor, best heat transfer, best light reflector amongst all metals on earth, and they are the 2nd most versatile commodity on earth after oil used in more than 10,000 industrial applications today. 
For example, tiny bit of gold and silver used in Apple's lightening cable connector.
 
So, give some more credit to silver! I am a bitcoin-silver hybrid.

Adam of breadwallet was in Tokyo last week and participated in "Future of Bitcoin Wallets" panel discussion event with two other wallet maker, Ninki Wallet and Luxstack on the panel. 
Discussing security, UX and open/close source development.
Roger Ver answers a question on blockchain.info also.

I found your site very useful for me to learn multi-sig functions. Thanks for what you have been doing and I tipped some coins. Cheers from Tokyo. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:38:03
Have you tried Bitsquare, The decentralized bitcoin exchange? It is open source and completely decentralized. It is censorship resistant and permissionless. Liquidity is not the greatest but it is picking up. You are in US? You can buy $200 worth of coins. Down load the app and give it a try.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 08:06:33
I checked VISA's annual report (Page 10) and found they don't even know its own TPS.. 
We, Bitcoin people, know things real time. Yeah, we are still 1/1,000 of TPS but I feel we already won over next immediate competitor, VISA. 
Let's get Block Size/SegWit thing out of the way and move on, guys! We have MUCH MUCH challenges ahead!! 
@_date: 2017-02-10 04:38:12
Bitsquare is an open source project. It will be the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, if not the only exchange. We need more liquidity, download the app and and give it a try, Wow!

any specific versions of "older iPod touch" you recommend? I want to see what price range they are in the second hand market.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:40:05
I thought that problem was fixed by now. But if not, I will post them for you in the forum. You can list them here. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 11:17:48
Life goes on. Peace.
 
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:41:13
Can you please post them in the forum? Or you have problem with the forum confirmation e-mail? There was some issue last night. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:39:05
It may take some time. Because you know Bitsquare is censorship resistant and permissionless. Google and Apple may not approve the app.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:19:11


Done. Thanks for your interest and participation.
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:38:48
I just came back from three month traveling in Europe visiting Bitcoin meetups and friends. I stayed mostly AirBnB room with a host. I pitched Bitcoin to the hosts and my conversion rate is about 70%!! 
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:01:22
Thanks for screaming for Bitsquare all the time. (Although you no longer use bank account..) Yeah, trade mark law is a bit more complicated than we thought. And we don't want to be dragged into expensive legal proceedings. It will only make lawyers more fiat money. Hope you understand.
@_date: 2017-01-14 14:29:45
We need something like this in Shibuya, Tokyo!!
@_date: 2017-01-16 06:15:30
Thanks for giving it a try. You tried BTC/USD? Yeah, I agree the liquidity is not the greatest so premium may be higher than BTC/EUR pair. But hey, we all have to start somewhere, right? Perhaps, you can help us in providing BTC sell orders when you get come coins cheaper? You can make some profit doing this if you know what I mean.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:25:59
Try Bitsquare, The decentralized bitcoin exchange. It is open source and completely decentralized with no server. It is censorship resistant and permissionless. BTC/USD liquidity is not the greatest but you can actually buy some now. Give it a try, Wow! 
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:42:47

Bitsquare is opens source and completely decentralized with no server. No registration needed. Download the app and give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:46:38
wow, nice list. I bookmark this.

just curious what would happen if Indian government bans bitcoin next??
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:31:07
Have you tried Bitsquare, The decentralized bitcoin exchange? It is open source and completely decentralized with no server. It doesn't require personal ID since it is peer to peer software network platform. Give it a try! 
@_date: 2016-11-12 21:21:41
Why not give Bitsquare a try? It is open source and completely decentralized with no server. No registration needed. There are some SEK offers you can buy safely. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 10:39:36
Thanks for giving it a try. Yeah, I know BTC/USD liquidity is pretty low at the moment unlike BTC/EUR. But hey, we all have to start somewhere. This is an open source project and we feel like Satoshi in mid 2009. Would be great if you can give us a hand by leaving some orders for other fellow Americans? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:20:53
Have you tried Bitsquare, The decentralized bitcoin exchange? It is open source and completely decentralized with no server. Permissionless and censorship resistant. More people try it, the merrier it gets. Give it a try. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:25:12
Yes, it is fully functional. Liquidity is not the greatest but you can still trade buy/sell some coins safely. I just feel like Satoshi in mid 2009. Give it a try. Governments are more dangerous than we all think. Our time is coming!  
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:06:58
I think Modi was ordered by higher power to beta test in India before they roll out in other countries. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:20:40
TPTB will need something really really big to terrify us to beg for the one world government next. In that sense, I think they will manufacture false alien arrival to do this. C'mon guys, coming bank holiday is nothing scary than aliens..    
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:12:01
yes, arbitration is centralized today and trying to figure out how best it can be decentralized. as for liquidity, think of Satoshi in 2009. time will come soon. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:27:21
Yeah, I hear you. Nothing is perfect. Bitsquare is like localbitcoins at the moment so not for day/auto-traders, more for BTC/Other alt coin stackers. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:18:40
depends on pairs and liquidity is pretty low. but if you do BTC/Euro, you can trade something like 2% spread.   
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:39:40
Bitsquare is now on coin.dance, too! 
It is open source and completely decentralized with no server. It is censorship resistant and permissionless. Liquidity is not as big as big brother, localbitcoins. But, we are working on a DAO structure now. Give it a try! 
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:53:15
Thanks for your willingness to give it another try. Every small liquidity position will help. Yes, you can set % to set your price above Bitcoin Average API so, it should be fine. I really think things will become more difficult for people to buy BTC. So, we need to get ready for the time to come. Our forum is quite active and come over! We are also working on DAO structure now. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:20:54

I thought Indians were buying gold, no? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:40:32
Go Canadians! You are not alone!! Decentralizing the exchange layer is critical for the entire Bitcoin's ecosystem, IMHO. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 09:05:16
I am helping the lead dev u/Manfred_Karrer in PR and Business Development. You know Bitsquare earns some revenue in the form of trading fee in BTC. Based on the backing of this revenue stream, we plan to issue Bitsquare tokens and use them as incentives for contributors. We are also working on building a censorship resistant DAO structure. Stay tuned!

I did a diagram of how Bitsquare trade works. (especially how Bitcoin moves within the built-in wallet and multisig). I admit it is not for everyone as yet so I think we first appeal to those who care about privacy. Let me know if any queries. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:51:54
Don't we feel like Satoshi in mid 2009 when very few of us foresee the potential of the project?
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:14:53
Great to hear you gave it a try. It is open source so people can build really cool tools on top/with it. It will be more interesting in future. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:36:18
great reply, wow!
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:31:57
Bitsquare to the rescue! 
I think things will become tough as the day go by especially for our fellow American bitcoiners. Our BTC/USD liquidity is very small so please give us a hand in putting some orders.
Bitsquare is open source and completely decentralized with no server. It is censorship resistant and permissionless.  
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:37:00

$US liquidity is not the greatest at the moment but our time is coming! Give it a try!

I posted this above. This diagram may help to see how Bitsquare transaction will move within the build-in app and multisig address.

Hi Nikos, 
I am Ken Shishido of Bitcoin Tokyo Meetup Group leader here. One of our good friend and Bitcoin enabled lawyer, Saito-san, is visiting Athens from 23rd next week on a vacation.
