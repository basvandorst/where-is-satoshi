The important thing here is that the infrastructure is in place.  Kenyans are already used to banking with their phones.  It's a very short step to BitCoins.

Now do a yard glass.  That would be a conversation *ender*.

That is so.  I had a dark time in my life when I would have done exactly as you propose, had I the means.  Fuck the world, if I can't be happy, no one should be.
But a huge part of the reason I felt that way could be solved by eliminating the crap that made me unhappy in the first place.  The very same technology that makes these scenarios plausible, also makes them less likely.

It will.  With news about "3D printable guns" ignorant regulators are starting to jump on that shit.
You shouldn't be so pessimistic.  We're slowly approaching a time when governments are going to be obsolete, and while that's going to be disruptive, it's also going to be a ton of fun.

If you can drink a yard glass of mojitos, I'll pay for 'em.  But a YARD GLASS, not just a pretend glassy thing with a bulb on the bottom.
