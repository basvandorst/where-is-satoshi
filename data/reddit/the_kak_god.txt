Yea, this is like asking if you can move your car off the dealers lot after buying it.

This is satire? If anycoin in existence today survives 20 years from now Ill be highly impressed. I think the best is yet to come.

So is this law setting precedent that current trades are "like-kind"? And possibly after January 1st these trades will not be "like-kind"?

I'd argue if you haven't read the [Bitcoin white paper]( which is only 8 pages long, that you are only here because "Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)". It's only just this year that the institutions that finance this country are beginning to invest. Maybe by the end of 2018/2019 the true dumb money will start to flow in. The people that check a box on their 401k plan that says they want "risky" investments in their portfolio sort of people.
Anyways, my hand was weak and I folded. I've moved on to sh**coins boys. Now I just need to figure out how much taxes I have to come up.

Does it feel bad knowing you could be 3x richer? Initial investment $50k im guessing? Thats awfully impressive to gamble that.

My brother is insistent about telling everyone and anyone that I own cryptocurrency and I'm making a fortune. Nope, I have far less than 6 figures in crypto. After this last month I told him and my family I sold everything and that crypto is just a bubble now.
I love my family but sharing information about how much money you own or make is not cool. It creates unnecessary tension. When a struggling family member of friend needs help they will turn to you for thousands of dollars. I don't mind helping here and there but they start acting like you should pay their $20,000 credit card bills for free because it really only cost you $100 back in the day.
And then they get offended you won't help them and the relationship you had, the one where both of you were very happy with each other, is gone up in smoke.

No, both are wrong. Americans are just a little bit more wrong. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss Z is the only good way forward.
