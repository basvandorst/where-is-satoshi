I never said anything about raping babies. "having someone's rape baby" is accepting the consequences of them forcing themselves upon you, submitting to them entirely, accepting your violation uncontested.

The point is to close the loop, or in this case to have the bitcoin enter the system as early as possible and have as little as possible leave.
If OP is a true believer, they can transact with as many others who also stay inside the system, and eventually leave fiat for nothing but paying taxes.

I go to a site for the article, not to have its sponsor's rape babies. You might be fine with surfing bareback, whoring yourself out for a few words on a screen but I happen to value my privacy and security a little more than that. Not putting out doesn't make me an asshole, the pricks who are serving trackers on behalf of the corporate surveillance apparatus are the assholes, and by accepting their behaviour you're an enabler.
I have no problem with tracker-riddled sites dying because their immoral and abusive revenue streams dried up. Good riddance to them.

Firstly, your MAC doesn't go on the TCP/IP network, it's an Ethernet thing. Secondly, you can break your coins down into as many addresses as you like and push them all over the place, but if at some point you fuck up and merge them back together into one then you've just showed that you own the entire chain of addresses between them.
So to keep your anonymity and also cash out, someone needs to merge them with other people's coins for you. You need to trust that person isn't keeping data on you.

You actually have no idea. Bitcoin's ledger is completely open to those with all the information, it allows the 
existing power structures to monitor the world's economic activity. It gives the rich a way to teleport wealth from 
collapsing regions, leaving the local poor to rot. It was very likely invented by the US government with the intention 
of using it to undermine currencies created by democratically elected governments, governments that actually represent
their citizens. It remains to be seen but I suspect that digital gold and smart contracts can reduce the economic risks 
of war and thereby exasserbate conflict. The deflationary nature of it could collapse the world economy and trigger the 
next great depression.
It's not all sunshine and lollipops. It's a very dangerous and exciting technology that happens to have a neoliberal 
philosophy baked in. It has, is and will change the world, maybe, if we're lucky, it'll be for the better. 
But we shouldn't assume it's all good and sit around quaffing our farts.

More likely Satoshi is the US government and when the keys were generated they were done so in a way that has some other cryptographic qualities that allow secret, off-chain transfers or similar.

Yeah (there's loads of bots on GitHub if you want to run one) but the US exchanges charge trading fees, so doing too many trades would eat into the bot owners' capital. When there's no trading fees you could have billions of dollars of Bitcoin traded every minute without any coin even changing hands (market manipulation much?), plus the margins are much smaller because trading fees don't eat into profits, so more legitimate trades happen as the price oscillates.
If there was an API for, say, moneys transferred in and out of the exchange, that would be more useful. Still rife for manipulation depending on how trustworthy the exchange in question is is, but a far better measure anyway.
@_date: 2016-12-31 20:25:56

@_date: 2017-11-08 14:55:36
I think I see the attack. Your trade looks like this:
1. On Core chain, you make a transaction that sends 1 satoshi from YourAddress1 to Segwit2xIncompatibleAddress, and the change goes to YourAddress2. This transaction is incompatible with 2x so you now have it in different addresses on each chain.
2. Later on the Segwit2x chain, you send from YourAddress1 to TraderAddress as part of a trade. This transaction can't be replayed on the Core chain because the money has already been spent. All is good.
However, sometime before step 1, the mining takeover conspiracy have switched to mining 2x, slowing the block count on the Core chain to a crawl. After a short time they switch back to mining Core, but from a point in time before step 1. They grow a new longest chain that doesn't include your transaction from step 1, and instead they include your transaction from step 2.
Your Bitcoin on the Core chain has now been sent to TraderAddress, which isn't what you wanted.

Good engineers know that if you make a system in which you can easily do an idiotic thing then the system is at as much fault as the user. This is why C gets so much flak for memory management, PHP get laughed at for its inconsistencies and JavaScript for its type system.
Stairs that that have steps of varying height, railings that are just big enough to take a child's head, doors that have handles on the push side... well-designed systems are designed to make user-error hard. If a system allows you to easily piss away hundreds of millions of dollars on a stupid mistake then the system has to shoulder some blame.
And that's what we need to take away from this, learn from the mistakes so that future VM design and smart contract tooling make it really hard to fuck up this way. The price of being a pioneer in this space is that this sort of thing happens, and along with that comes the responsibility to learn from a $300m lesson rather than gloss over it.

The fact that it's possible to destroy a library contract that is a dependency of existing contracts and leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of value in limbo, that's an Ethereum feature.

Yeah, visiting this every few years and comparing hosting costs would be a good idea. In the next ten years we're likely to hit another storage revolution. Verifying the chain on GPU might also be worthwhile too, given that consumer-grade hardware is increasingly likely to have a decent GPU. That just leaves network.
Space being cheap, networks being fast and big blocks being easy to verify would make good arguments for a carefully considered block-size increase.

If you want the return of early Bitcoin then don't invest in other similar coins. Research, find or build the next big technology.

When it was all about the [buffer overflows]( we quite rightly blamed C for being awful at memory management, and years of effort went into fixing it but it was still largely replaced as a high level language. Many web developers quite rightly blame PHP for [being shit]( and it's been laughed off the Internet in recent years thanks to all the exploits. People don't make the same complaints about Java or .Net or Python or Ruby, it's harder to make huge mistakes in those languages.
It's Ethereum's Turing-complete VM and and a JavaScript-based high level language that make colossal footbullets like these inevitable. It's bloody hard to write Ethereum smart contracts that aren't extremely dangerous. It's shit in the same way that PHP (unintuitive) and C (unforgiving) are.

Bitcoin is very easy to monitor, it leaves a permanent paper trail and is the surveillance state's wet dream.
Governments want traceable electronic currency because it will let them collect taxes. The right sort of cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin (and unlike Monero or Dash), will allow this, so they will allow Bitcoin and it'll become worth lots of money, while anonymous cryptos will end up banned.

A communist government would most likely not like bitcoin at all. It prevents a tyrannous majority from seizing the wealth of the oppressive few; it's a tool for financial liberty and as long as the whole world isn't communist it allows seamless flight of capital to more economically liberal jurisdictions.
Bitcoin is shaped in a way that favours those with wealth and those with monitoring power. It's not great for anarchists or dissidents because it's not inherently fungible, illegal funds can be blacklisted by those with power. 
Anarchistic cryptos are anonymous, a socialist coin would allow wealth redistribution. Bitcoin is fiscally liberal and socially conservative, it's aligned with the right.

I think Gnutella wins that award, not Bittorrent. The reason Bittorrent became the dominant file sharing software is because it was less decentralized than the alternatives. Trackers could favour smaller selections of specialized content with verified files, ban leeches, kickstart downloads, it allowed communities and walled gardens to form. This is actually in contrast to the free-for-all of the early p2p days.

When bitcoin forks into two altcoins in august, do you think the drug and hacking markets will go back to sending cash in the post? If bitcoin loses its utility it'll be dropped instantly and most probably permanently.

Quantum functions only describe the likelihood of events happening don't they? They aren't an actual reality if you can't experience them directly.

This is a very low-quality comment. It didn't add anything that an upvote doesn't add.

Nobody knew what they were doing early on in bitcoin days. MtGox infrastructure and code is from a time when coins were worth 30 cents each.

Yeah, I was just pointing out that powerful nation states lose their military and/or economic power far less often than technologies are superseded. It's disingenuous to compare bitcoin and the dollar.

Yeah but it still wouldn't happen. Mesh networks are already a thing and have been for ages, they just aren't popular outside of densely populated urban areas, plus they're slow as shit.

It was touted as anonymous for a long time, and suitable for microtransactions and also whatever dialogue pumped the price.

Sounds like a good argument for some other cryptocurrency, which is how Bitcoin probably ends.

There's no way some completely anonymous person on the darknet is going to just hand $1.5M back to you. You can consider it turned into crack and smoked by now.

The spaces wouldn't be displayed or copied when someone highlights, they're just formatting.

Not astroturfing, just loads of ignorant gobshites who don't have the support of the developers or the silent majority.

Work on privacy and anonymization features, making blockchain analysis harder or ideally impossible. Work on reducing fees and lowering the barriers to entry. Is it possible to have a safe and relatively anonymous mobile wallet?

Dev of the .onion wallet, presumably a completely anonymous developer who hangs out on the darknet.

Do sponsors generally know who will be speaking in advance, or do they just trust the organizers?
I've never organized or been part of such an event so I'm in no position to sling that particular type of shit.

Reddit uses Markdown for formatting and you want to post plain text, so you've got to post as code: use three backticks on each end of your message (\`\`\`) or four spaces at the start of each line.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:34:55
I'm not that other guy but I think it's fucking irresponsible, borne of frustration rather than careful consideration and solid engineering practices, it doesn't have the support of the developers, could permanently damage bitcoin and is being pushed by people who have disproportionately less skin in the game than those they will hurt. If you had the coin you'd spend it on hash power instead, right?
