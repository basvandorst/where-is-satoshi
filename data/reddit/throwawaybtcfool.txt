Yes this is what happened. I don't even access blockchain from the machine i used, it was a one off, and i was distracted. On my normal computer I have a shortcut of course. 99% of the time i type in the url field, 99% of the time if i don't i click on the right link. 99% of the time i notice something wrong is happening. It was just a big mistake and some bad luck that i got punished for it

I'm not complaining, and I'm not blaming bitcoins fault. I'm blaming myself first of all, because I made a huge mistake, and of course blaming the criminals who stole from me. You don't have to feel sorry for me of course. It's your right to think as you please. I came here for some support and to warn others not to make the same mistakes I did.

I have a shortcut usually, I don't log in from that computer usually and wasn't thinking. I didn't come here for sympathy, and I didn't come here to get this attitude either. I have beaten myself up about it enough, don't need anyone else doing it either. I know i fucked up.

thanks for your comment. How can i trace him. My friend had a look at the account in question, and it looks like alot of BTC were sent from this account to many other accounts. I don't know if there is any reason to not post the transaction where i lost all my BTC?
