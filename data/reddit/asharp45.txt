Yessir. 
Does everybody know about McDonald's Argentina taking the Big Mac off the menu? Presumably to keep it off the Economist's Big Mac index?
Mickey-d's in Argentina still sells the big mac, but it's not on the menu and it's 1/3rd cheaper than other combos on the menu.
They also arrested some economists for publishing higher-than-govt-numbers inflation:
Bitcoin *Argentina*!

Like 1/10th of 2% of your investment portfolio, then repeat once a month for 10 months. That's what I would do today. If you get a feeling about a drop, eg price drops 50% on something like China, feel free to deviate from the program briefly.

Bitcoin could play a (small) role in the petrodollar wars, but for now the ruble, yuan, and dollar are still the big question marks.

We have that. Regional Feds are owned (literally) by the banks in their area. JPMorgan, for example, has dividend-paying ownership shares of the NY Fed. Jamie Dimon sits on the BOD.
But yes, I get the point. Fiat is currently legitimized/enabled by the state, even if it's basically a private monopoly.

How does he call it a waste? From his post:


Clarification edit - he does call it a "waste" but says the utility of gold as currency far surpasses the "waste" created.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:47:21
Ok, but it would not go mainstream. OKCupid, Reddit, and other big sites would not accept btc if it was illegal... 
It seems like people who have made a lot of $ on btc are blind to the risk of govt intervention. An *attempt* at banning merchants from accepting is almost inevitable IMO. Whether it succeeds is the question.
The US confiscated all privately-held gold in 1933. You don't think they'd hesitate to ban a competing currency?

I don't always call economists idiots, but when I do they're usually Paul Krugman or Brad Delong.

I hear that a lot, but don't buy it. Why is Google building self-driving cars for example? It'll take at least 15 years for it to pay off.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:13:42
Biggest risk, IMO, is govt regulation. They won't accept a nearly untraceable, untaxable currency lying down. I bet within 2 years there is an attempt to ban merchants from accepting it.
All they need is one high profile murder, terror act, teen drug overdose, associated w/ btc. Scaring the public into believing it's a danger is easy after that.

Why would it be hard for govt to write some legislation saying "It is now illegal for merchants to accept bitcoin."?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:28:12
having notable VCs on board is arguably the best thing for btc. They can lobby, fight back, etc. Invaluable. I bought more after Fred Wilson and USV invested in Coinbase. Hugely important.
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:19:49
Value deflation is a big factor as well. Portions are smaller, ingredients are cheaper, and govts don't reflect this in official inflation 
Also the fact that official  are cooked to high hell.

Wrong. You have to pay capital gains on gold/silver, unlike a *currency*.

big news, guys with political capital.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:28:54
It really wouldn't be hard at all. Wait til somebody kills someone else with a gun bought on the darknet with btc (or some other heineous act), pass legislation with ease. What reputable merchant would defy the Anti-Terror Currency Act?
I'm saying this cause it concerns me, and I understand the potential of bitcoin to disrupt current fiat systems.
@_date: 2013-06-21 20:15:29
makes sense if you think about it. In Argentina inflation is raging, and people are flocking to 1) US $'s 2) btc.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:28:24
it's illegal in every state but Utah for merchants to accept gold/silver as currency. you don't think they can do the exact same thing with btc? I really hope they don't, but suspect they may.

Yup me too. I think chances of a regulation/ban crackdown are relatively high. But I still own a fair # of them cause the potential is so big.

US confiscated all US citizen's gold and *revalued* it in 1933. They would never do that to a digital currency, though.
