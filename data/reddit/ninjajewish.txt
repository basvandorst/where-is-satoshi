like the $25m cash influx they received last month?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:08:05
news outlets have not reported yet, if you feel this will shake up bitcoin in a postive way nows your chance to "get in before the surge"
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:50:35
may i ask a serious question? what happens to those bitcoins that coinbase receives?  how are those bitcoins recycled into your hands or mine?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:45:57


woah, says who?  what do you think happens when you remove a central authority.  [this post sums it up best](
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:02:17
this is the idea behind mint.  you allow them to sign into your bank account.  they can perform money transfers on your bank of america account if they wanted.  so in a nutshell, it's insanity to use mint (a free product) in general.

if they have nefarious intentions then isn't that, [by definition, conspiracy](
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:08:54
and how do they do that when coinbase pays out in usd?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:12:32
no, but it would just prove the hoard-theory correct
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:04:51
Yet you cannot provide any insightful examples to the contrary...

i meant to say refund your purchase. in step 2.

to the err.. moon?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:24:11
what if coinbase does not sell them.  wouldnt that cause the price of bitcoin to go up as less coins are available on the market to buy as demand increases?
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:05:23
what if what?
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:30:57
coins which they buy from bitstamp.  who is to say they won't continue the process and just hold onto the other bitcoins.
look i understand there is a perfect chance they may indeed recycle the coin.  but the thought experiment we are doing right now is what if they do not.  so please put on your objective thinking cap and tell me what would happen in the case of coinbase, bitpay, or any other payment processor holding onto bitcoin for substantial future gains (like when btc/usd = $10,000)
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:30:19
i buy so you may hoard.  once you give up your merchandise, you have no reason to sell it back to me (or anyone for that matter) until the price reaches a certain point.  that certain point could potentially be far far away if the whole to the moon mindset sticks.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:19:12
how about the other way around?
1 buy item with bitcoin, say 1 BTC worth
2 if price of bitcoin goes up, refund your bitcoin, get additional money. sell overstock gift cards on giftcard resale site, convert to fiat
3 take money earned in 2a, wait for bitcoin price to drop ever so slightly, buy &gt;1 bitcoins at lower price.  
repeat 1 - 3 until overstock stops accepting bitcoin.  if anything overstock has become the first bitcoin money launderer/non-verified exchange
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:26:08
so the hoarding theory is potentially true?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:13:09
give them your coins!
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:45:11
yea, but where is the incentive to change?  everyone is signing up and using mint en masse.  if people actually cared about their security they wouldn't use it.  cest le vie
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:15:52
why the downvotes, it is true.  but i guess the downvoters aren't going to report the gains on their taxes anyway so it's more of a 'shhhh or you'll ruin it for the rest of us' kind of thing
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:14:38
Their terms of service say otherwise.  Plus the onus is on you to prove it was mint that caused your account to be hacked and not your negligence in using a password such as 'hunter21'
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:20:03
thank you for [agreeing with me]( the government regulations are in the open just as much as ghash.io's double spending is out in the open.  they both may not publicly admit their actions are attempts to bilk working people out of their hard earned money, but they are still making decisions based on enriching themselves and their backers.  the distinct difference between bitcoin and the government's fiscal policy is that with enough outrage people can change the government fiscal policies *without great affect to the holders of USD monetary vehicles* .  with bitcoin, if a private group owns &gt;50% of the network (as ghash.io is steadily moving towards) the rest of the network has no option but to fork and remove ghash.io from the network.  investor confidence drops, and there goes your bitcoin value.  why would overstock, amazon, or any investment group want to back bitcoin if this can happen every few years (see btc guild fiasco 2 years ago)
(ps no one was talking about conspiracy theories, so please do not bring alex jones into this discussion)

it looks like boliviously-away and obliviously-away are the same user.  RedditInspect can't find any correlation between either of the -away accounts though
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:06:32
what has the government done in secret, in regards to fiscal monetary policy.  was TARP done behind closed doors?  what about QE, was that hidden from public view?  am i missing something?  was our prosecution of BoA, HSBC, and JP Morgan done in secret?  I don't see how a blatent failure in the protocol is considered a feature.. [unless what you're saying is Bitcoin was designed by Microsoft](
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:11:54
Just remember, Ghash.io is double spending against BD.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are working on more sophisticated double spending attacks for the future
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:29:35
Have you followed the drama on or People have up and walked off with thousands of BTC.  Their intentions are cloaked and masked just as well.  How does making a ledger public fix any of that?  further, ghash.io IS public and they are BLATENTLY double spending yet more computing power is joining their pool even though signup is not available to the public.  How is that different from the government you claim is conspiring against you with nefarious intentions?

Yes, the Banking Secrecy Act prohibits this.  They can also refuse to wire money to organizations or individuals linked to known terrorist organizations.  That said, BTC-e is not on any blacklist (that i am aware of), so I would suggest calling higher up the ranks to settle the matter with USAA.  You also may have a shot at using the legal system if your account policies are worded in your favor
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:51:55


quickly?  you usually have 30 days to remedy it.  longer with a vsa/mc debit card.  if it's a smaller transaction i'm willing to bet you would walk away knowing that you are only down the amount you gavee them.  if it's more, i'm willing to bet you would dispute the transaction.
are you seriously saying bitcoin is better than a credit card because you can reverse a charge with credit cards?
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:52:49
you should step up to do it!

FYI, 0-day malware and malware targeted specifically for an individual won't show up in a scan.  I could write a program, custom-tailored for your environment, that boots with your system, runs in the background, and monitors what you are doing all without setting off alarms from your malware scanner.  This is why you should get in the habit of whitelisting applications instead of blacklist them (or in other words, use some sort of restrictive-by-default mandatory access control).
