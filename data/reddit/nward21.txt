"Wall Street likes to make money, bottom line."
  
Oh really... Then I guess they would probably love the 1700% gains Bitcoin has had on the year, huh?

Actually, Venezuelans are using bitcoin at record high levels due to it's censorship resistant properties. Here is just a small scale look on localbitcoins. One of the more simple/straightforward onramps for Venezuelan citizens to use in acquiring bitcoin: 
  
If you want to learn more about how bitcoin is being used in Venezuela and the current situation there, I suggest this podcast episode:

The UI for Bread Wallet is excellent. I’d go with that.

I run a bitcoin merch store and just created a "Running Bitcoin" design. I am donating 100% of profits on all "Running Bitcoin" merch to the ALS Association in Hal Finney's name.
  
If you're interested in checking out the shop, here's the link:

UPDATE: I was able to replace BitPay with Coinbase Commerce, if that makes any difference to you.

If that's true it's only because they don't yet understand the following:  
  
"As hodlers hoard more bitcoin, the “float” (supply actively being traded) is increasingly constrained. With a decreasing available supply, each new user puts more upward pressure on the price. As price rises, media shines a spotlight, new users are pulled in, and before long we’re back in another hype cycle."
  
Great read for those interested. It's from part 2 of a 3 part article series:

Yes you can. There is an option during checkout to pay with bitcoin.

Hal Finney was computer scientist, cypherpunk, and an early Bitcoin contributor. He received the first bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
  
Inspiration for this design came from his tweet in 2009, where he simple said “Running bitcoin” - 
  
In October 2009, Finney announced in an essay on the blog Less Wrong that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in August 2009. He continued to program until his death; he was working on experimental software called bcflick, which uses Trusted Computing to strengthen Bitcoin wallets.

Yea, I have received a few messages like this. It's currently the only bitcoin integration that Shopify offers. I have had a few people DM me and just send direct BTC payment in exchange for a 100% coupon code. I'd gladly do the same for you if interested. From what I hear, BTCPay Server is working on an implementation, but having trouble because Shopify tends to works mostly with businesses not open source projects. 
I'd be interested in hearing you out regarding setting up a different payment gateway for bitcoin. What options do you know of that would work with Shopify?
  
Edit: You could always HODL your bitcoin as well, and get rid of that dirty fiat lol.
