Bitcoin is a huge threat to the existing financial and political system. It's potentially disastrous to their business model based on walled gardens, permissioned innovation, palm greasing, and acting as middlemen and taking a cut wherever they can. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value, the very lifeblood of society, without anyone's permission. As long as you control the private key that encumbers an UTXO, no one has any say in how, when and to whom you transfer value.
It's not a surprise that these trojan horse hijacking attempts keep happening time and again, and that they're usually instigated by the exact same people (**Brian Armstrong**, **Erik Voorhees**, **Stephen Pair** etc). These crony capitalists pay lip service to free markets and voluntary exchange, but they'd love nothing more than to have exclusive access to the state's monopoly on violence in order to capture as much profit as possible, thereby making themselves kings and rulers, destroying the very thing they claim to espouse.
Luckily Bitcoin was made to resist such attacks and the only thing they result in is a loss of money for their instigators (e.g. the Bitmain fiasco).

Sounds about right. Sophism and mental gymnastics is their specialty.

They also claim that the Bilderberg family has hijacked Bitcoin and is keeping blocks small. That sub has cost me a lot of popcorn.

There's one **huge** problem people consistently fail to see in relation to mixing. One that can even land you in prison, having done absolutely nothing wrong. Can you guess what it is?
Let me enlighten you: by mixing, you are typically mixing your UTXOs with those of other people. Some of those strange outputs that are now tainting yours -- which wouldn't be a problem if they were verifiably clean -- but they're usually not (think about who usually uses mixers). More likely than not, you'll be mixing with or swapping for outputs used in much more nefarious activities such as online drug trade, black markets, extortion etc. Whoever committed the most nefarious crime stands to gain the most by mixing, since they'll be swapping their maximally dirty outputs for less dirty ones. 
So in a misguided attempt to preserve your privacy, you end up getting tainted UTXOs that are being tracked by law enforcement. One day you decide to take some money off the table and those outputs end up in your Coinbase account, upon which you find armed men knocking on your door, wanting to have a chat.
Make sense? People who fail to understand this point seem not to understand how Bitcoin works as a technology and should perhaps lay off weighing in on why bcash will "flippen" Bitcoin and perhaps stop spewing Blockstream conspiracy theories.

Sure sure, muh flippening any day now, especially with Bitcoin remaining relatively stable and alts losing 10% a day. Did you ever manage to remortgage your house?

So you're saying that there is an Ethereum smart contract type that can detect the death of a person and initiate a transaction based on that fact?

Most of them are get-rich-quick degenerate gamblers who know nothing about the underlying technology of the thing they're trading.

It's a soft fork thanks to segwit. All they have to do is add Schnorr to a new witness program version.

Do you wager it has anything to do with shitcoin trolls coming here during the 2017 run, taunting us with losing market cap dominance and an imminent "flippening" happening, calling bitcoin "the Myspace of crypto"...?
Now that it's not happening and they've had their asses handed to them by the market, they claim that BTC meanies aren't playing nice and that we should all get along... (presumably until the next bull cycle when they can start trolling again). No thanks, I will call scams out for what they are and their investors for the greedy fools that they are.

No valid conclusion can be drawn from what you just said. Yeah we get it, you're saying Bitcoin is a crap investment.
Back in 2008 I tried my hand at stocks, lost a sizable amount, invested in Bitcoin a few years later and now I don't have to work another day in my life. Does that mean stocks are crap? No, it just means I got the timing differently from you. It's life, these things happen. The sooner we learn to live with that, the better off we are.

Insulting people and calling them stupid and clueless will definitely make them evaluate your argument rationally and not make them think you're an angry spergy douche with a chip on his shoulder. Oh well. Carry on.

Then why are you still here?

Blockchain.info/com is owned by Roger Ver, the guy who runs BCH. He hates segwit, so that needs no further explanation.
BTC.com is owned by Bitmain, another major BCH player who hates segwit.
That said, some block explorers do support bech32 addresses. Usually those not associated with Bitmain or Roger Ver.
