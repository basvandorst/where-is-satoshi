I wish that crash would’ve prevented my 12k limit sell from going through =(
Thought it would hit 12k and then drop.

Can’t say I’m a big fan of BitPay either. I tried to move $50 in btc to my bitpay credit card and the total in fees was $49.

Don’t worry man the price will come back up just like it always does. It may take awhile to get to 20k but it’ll get there. We were due for a correction anyway so I’m not surprised. 
Look at it as a bitcoin holiday sale.

Could someone explain smart contracts to me? I understand the basics, but let’s say there’s a dispute. I decide I want to use a smart contract for COD. I receive my item but decide I want to keep the money and claim it never came. Company says goods were delivered, I say they weren’t. Who decides whether the funds get released if there’s no third party?

I’ve sent plenty of transactions lately and never had to pay a $49 fee on a $50 transaction

Basically I’m saying if both parties disagree how does the contract know what really happened?

It's $12...

I'm one of those 60,000. Been waiting 14 hours for a confirmation.

That's exactly what I was thinking. This guy knew what he was doing was shady now he's all mad and trying to act innocent. "Oh I thought 75% off gift cards were legit"

The truth is you bought gift cards purchased with stolen credit cards. I hope you're not dumb enough to believe someone would pay cash for a gift card and then sell it at 75% off for btc. It's not hard to fake a cash receipt.
