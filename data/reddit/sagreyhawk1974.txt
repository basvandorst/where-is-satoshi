no, actually impossible odds
there's a huge glaring oversight with the current cryogenics model
the thing is, suppose they are able to build a nanobot that can do the necessary cleanup and repairs to return a mush of frozen cells to their original healthy state. Improbable, but not impossible, correct. Give it a few thousand years and we might have that.
the problem with current cryogenics is however, there is currently no way to do an exhaustive survey of the healthy state of your individual brain cells, before they dunk your head into the freezer and turn it into frozen slush, so the nanobot will have no building plan to actually rebuild you. 
So have the nanobot do the repairs with a generic building plan, you say. the problem is a) the brain doesn't work that way and b) even if they did it that way what would come out would not be you, the individual jtsnau, but whomever the building plan was based on (it was General nau, emperor of the star reaches of gamma aquilae)

Imagine yourself in Kansas. You see a tornado approaching you, wind ripping and roaring furiously. A cow flies by bleating helplessly. 
You plant your feet firmly in the ground and look the tornado right in the eye. Summoning up all your will, you extend the chinese paper fan and begin waving it in an intricate pattern.
The tornado plants your neighbors car right onto your head and continues whistling by.
This is your plan.

The car dealer never accepted Bitcoin for that Lamborghini. They got US dollars.
Cascacius physical bitcoins are not made by a company, but by a single dude in his basement. Also he went all "fuck the feds" and restarted sales again.
"Each bitcoin" can't have a detailed history, because there is no concept of a coin as a singular unit in the protocol. There are only accounts and values.
Regarding Kreuzberg it is disingenious to call the precinct bitcoin friendly, when the entire so called Bitcoin Kiez consists of a single street corner.
Considering that no one has ever traveled with Virgin Galactic to space yet, space does not really seem to be a valid option as the furthest you can go with bitcoin (in other news I am selling hyperspeed flights to Alpha Centauri for Bitcoin, so you might want to add that. Wait, what do you mean I don't really fly there? Well, so doesn't Virgin.)

Reddit is too small to handle your posting volume, Phinn XD
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:41:32


No, you're pretty much fucked.

Hahahahaahahaha "there's no risk of fraud or identity theft" that's hilarious 
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:51:44
You're missing out. It's pretty damn awesome

"under optimal conditions" means laminated and sealed in a light free environment such as a safe. Even then I would sincerely doubt it would keep well enough for any QR codes to still be scannable

You should probably press that button that says "spell check" at some time.

Livememe Apparently doesn't allow "Bitcoin User Not Affected" memes anymore.

Actually this -&gt; "Wtf is it with you and old news? This has been posted 4 days ago already. You STILL don't know how to use the search?? How is this even possible?" IS downvoting.

Nice Stockholm syndrome

I wouldn't worry. I'm sure they reply in Two WeeksTM.

Do you know how long it takes to set up a bank account?
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:57:11
Think about metal bars hitting supple flesh and crunching bones.

@_date: 2013-10-14 12:57:25
Whoa. What just happened?

That's a beautiful password. So so beautiful &lt;3

In order of your questions.
- Buy them, the time to mine is long over
- It depends on your stuff. I mean... ooh, you mean computery stuff. Don't mine on computers. That time is long over.
- scamcoin
- right as of this minute, bitcoin. This may change in 30 seconds.
- at a loss and very slowly 
- drugs

Thank you. Please send my winnings of 0.7 BTC to 1HNLqLrPEwMk8woA91qwX9sRkatRfQik2T

So it's Google Drive only less good?

@_date: 2013-10-30 11:12:33
yes. it's the one ATM that's only accessible during service hours of that one cafe and that needs an hour to register a new user that is driving up buy orders. That is exactly what is happening.
@_date: 2013-09-12 07:24:19


Ah yes. Like the Swastika. Or the US Dollar.
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:52:48
This should totally happen. Is there a letter writing campaign yet or a petition or something? The only reason I can think of why they have not given the Nobel Price yet is that they just don't know about bitcoin. We should let them know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-04 09:07:10
I think there's an error somewhere. I have not received my winnings yet. Please send my winnings of 0.7 BTC to 1HNLqLrPEwMk8woA91qwX9sRkatRfQik2T

Yeah, Germans are HUGE on wearing symbols.
@_date: 2013-09-04 13:06:19
Oh so NOW you don't win anymore when it clearly said I won 0.7 BTC. Sounds like a scam to me. Gonna ask for a scammer tag.

That's nice.
Now wtf is libreoffice

What's your password? I need it to.... do things that are helpful to you.
@_date: 2013-09-04 09:17:16
You should get a better spell check or at least one that doesn't include corpolitcal, Andriod or recieve.
