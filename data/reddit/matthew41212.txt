Does owning silver help? Can you get "special" treatment. Ex. People are limited to 1 of something but because you have silver they will sell you more.

Take how much bitcoin you have and multiply by the price. Even if you have a fraction of one you still multiply by price. At 25k per bitcoin if you have 2.5 BTC it would be worth 62.5k$. Then subtract how much you paid to see your potential profit.

I'm not looking to pump and dump I'm more looking at this as a mental exercise. I believe this helps visualize how valuable and rare bitcoin is if this subr eddit could theoretically own about 5% of the bitcoin. This also go along with the 1 Bitcoin theory mental exercise and how there are over 38 million millionaires but only 21 million bitcoins. I find it fascinating to think about these things and am thankful to get into Bitcoin this early in the game.

I hypothesis that from a psychological standpoint people like round number from the greatest number place. So phycolocially one would want 100 before 10 before 1 , .1 .01, .001 etc. So eventually when 1 bitcoin is out of reach and .1 the next phycolocial point is .01 but with the current price it would be advisable to target the 1 btc point or .1 point.

But I won't be paying interest and would have 3 years to save up 5k to pay off the debt.

I understand the two quadrillion one hundred trillion satashi part and people could buy less that one but read the other part of my comment about the 1 Bitcoin theory. Psychologically people want nice round full numbers and there will only be 21 million opportunities for people. So with there being more fiat millionaires than the 21 million opportunities there is not many full bitcoin to go around. So if we combine these two exercises ( 1 million people buy 1 bitcoin each, people liking nice round numbers, more millionaires in fiat that 21 million opportunities) I ponder if all of these theories collided what would the demand and price for bitcoin be.

There are over 1000000 people on this subreddit. What if we in total tried to buy 1000000 btc. Would there be enough on the exchanges and how high would the price go.

I'm going to college. What I'm saying is what if I need 50k for college. With not having to pay till I graduate. Can I borrow an extra 5k, put that into Bitcoin to lock in the price. And while I'm in college save up the 5k and pay it off interest free. I'm not going to add 40k and buy 10. Something manageable. My parents are picking up the tab for the 50k.
