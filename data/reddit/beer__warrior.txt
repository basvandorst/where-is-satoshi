I'm arguing that "scaling Bitcoin" and Raspberry Pi do not belong in the same sentence. If you want to run the network with high reliability then you need better equipment. If you want to keep using this level of gear then the network has scaled as far as it will go. And maybe some level 2 layer will come along to help and maybe it won't, but the level 2 layer won't work if the level 1 is shaky and unreliable and dependent on volunteers spending their own resources for community benefit.

Of course it is. Everything is. Groups of people DDoSing each other because of ideological differences in the block size is good for bitcoin.

Segwit is good for bitcoin. Delaying segwit is good for bitcoin. Never implementing segwit is also good for bitcoin. Changing the protocol is good for bitcoin. Not changing the protocol for all eternity is good for bitcoin. A high hashrate is good for bitcoin. Miners becoming unprofitable and shutting down is good for bitcoin.

People have been posting this for years on this forum. "I have an idea, guys! Let's do all of our buying with Bitcoin. That will incentivize adoption, and will boost the utility of bitcoin and drive an increase in value!"
It doesn't work for a couple reasons:
* It's a huge pain in the ass to go buy bitcoins just for the purpose of using them to purchase things. Then when you do use Bitcoin as a buyer you lose all chargeback protections that you would have with a debit/credit card. It's an inferior way to purchase goods versus a credit card, and it takes a lot longer.
* There's really not much room in the blocks these days, which means that you need to put a fairly high fee on your transaction to get processed. Not cost effective for making many purchases per day.
* An increase in the velocity of money can drive down the price. The reason that bitcoin has value today is more due to its scarcity than its utility. Most coins do not move. If people were spending their coins more then the scarcity would be reduced, which would likely drive the price down. And the hodlers wouldn't like that very much.
The current vision of Bitcoin is to be digital gold, that is, an asset which acts as a store of long term value, not a tool for daily exchanges. Do you buy batteries and cigarettes with your gold? No? Then don't use Bitcoin that way.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:51:31

There's a certain amount of risk and no clear reward for the miners. It takes time and money to patch (and unpatch if something goes wrong). It might be like the upgrade to Windows Vista, technically a better platform but stability issues negated any benefit from new features.
 &gt; If it really is an amazing solution why are all the miners not implementing it
The proof is in the pudding. Either SegWit is overhyped and not a great solution, or it's a great solution but the rollout and communications campaign were botched.

And it's been banned (as best they can) by several more. The only reason that more governments haven't banned it is because it's so tiny with a niche group of users. It doesn't pose any threat to any moneyed interests. If that ever changed then expect regulations to come into play.

There are a lot of similar themes between Brexit and Trump's popularity. Both have an undercurrent of people who feel that globalization has left them behind.

@_date: 2016-11-14 21:00:53
Interesting. 
I'll admit I don't understand a lot of that stuff. But one of the arguments against raising the block size is that a smaller block size introduces a fee market by creating scarcity for transactions. And this has already been happening with the recent jumps in transaction costs. So my questions are:
1. Does SegWit actually compromise the new fee market by increasing the block size?
2. Aside from the blocksize debate, does SegWit otherwise increase the performance of the protocol?
3. Again, aside from blocksize, if there are performance increases to the protocol are they significant enough to justify the risks in deploying the code?

'Member that time you tipped me $3.50, and then I made a post about whether or not I should accept the tip, and then you took the tip back, and then I made another post about you taking tips back and then you tipped me $40 in embarrassment?
I 'member. 
Edit: I never told you the whole story on what happened. 
So I accepted the tip, but I really didn't have any use for the Bitcoin since I don't tip and I don't buy drugs online. I decided to donate it to the EFF, since they had an option to donate BTC via some now-defunct payment processor, probably BitPay. So I cashed out of Changetip into a new mycelium wallet and went to the EFF donation page, and looked at the value in dollars of the BTC in my wallet and entered that amount into the EFF donation page, since your donation is denominated in dollars. Then Bitpay gave me a QR code address and I transferred all of the BTC to it. 
However! Mycelium and Bitpay used different exchange rates to calculate the value in dollars of my coins, and then a message popped up in the window from Bitpay saying I still needed 0.0000001 BTC to complete my purchase. And that's when I said 'fuck it.'
I never got those funds returned to my wallet, but I couldn't say if they ever got to the EFF or if Bitpay just confiscated them. It was a pretty shitty user experience in any case.

Have you noticed in that same 1 1/2 years that Bitcoin has basically stalled out as a technology? What has happened in that time? A couple exchanges folded, and a couple darknet exit scams. A couple longtime developers walked away. A couple fake Satoshi sightings. Nothing else of note.
During that time Bitcoin hasn't become more useful or easy to use, and it's arguably gotten worse with spam transactions and uncertain fees structures. Is that the fault of the block size? Maybe, maybe not. But it makes you wonder what would have happened if the system wasn't arbitrarily constricted the way that it has been and allowed to grow a bit more organically.
@_date: 2016-09-08 22:55:57

Bitcoin is for teenagers who can't get credit cards so that they can buy drugs and Steam games.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:02:42
A currency is a placeholder for value. It's a piece of paper that says that it is redeemable by some accountable organization, usually a government. A currency represents a debt, and the backing organization owes you something. Typically it was redeemable for precious metals, but that has fallen by the wayside.
A commodity is something that has intrinsic value. It represents an asset. It's not backed by anything or anyone because it has innate value, and can be used. Examples are gold and oil.
Bitcoin is a commodity because it is not backed by anyone, and cannot be redeemed for anything by a backer. It has innate value (I guess, if you want to be generous) because it is a mathematically difficult number to procure. But what difference does it make if it's a commodity or a currency if you can buy your steam games online with it?
@_date: 2016-09-09 13:46:10
Yeah, well, it's not a perfect system. But that's how this society is constructed. And until you buy your own island and can create your own system of government then you're going to have to get used to this one. And that means that someone is going to force you to pay taxes, wherever you live.

Well, in all fairness to the community it's easy to treat all Bitcoin users as a single demographic. I think in reality there are several different factions with their own ideologies. There are the libertarians and goldbugs who detest government, but there are also techno-fetishists who love cryptography, and users who simply use it to buy contraband but don't buy into any ideology around it. Sounds like OP is the latter.
@_date: 2016-09-06 02:35:50
Bitcoin isn't for buying things, it's for hodling. Use a damn credit card and stop asking people to jump through hoops to get your $20. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:10:04
Right, that's the thing. It's probably the first intrinsically worthless commodity in the history of the world. Bitcoin is special like that. But it's traded like a modern commodity. If I buy futures on 100 barrels of oil on the commodity market, I'm never going to actually receive delivery of the barrels. So while on some level the oil is a physical good, my relationship with the oil is completely virtual. That's the relationship that bitcoin mimics, just removing the physical endpoint.

Precious metals and commodities (and real estate and other property, etc) are almost definitely better long-term stores of value than digital currencies. There are other national currencies as well if you don't like dollars.
Come to think of it, I'm not sure what your point is, other than you think the big bad gubment is a big meany and is somehow keeping you down. And you distrust your local government issued currency to store value with. 
Also, I always find it ironic that you Free Men complain about the government over the internet, something created specifically from government programs and for government users.

@_date: 2016-09-06 14:48:10
I like buying things online from Amazon. Fuck me, right?
@_date: 2016-09-06 02:03:02
Use a credit card like an adult. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 22:56:47
No. Lurk moar.

They want a government on their own individual terms. They want to pay for the services they see value in, and nothing else. Which sounds great. Unfortunately other people see value in other things sometimes, which is where the conflict seems to come in. Libertarianism would work great if everyone believed in exactly the same thing.

@_date: 2016-09-06 02:11:04


How do you know? Has this been tried?
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:05:09
You said you use those services.
Look, if you don't like it there are plenty of places you can go live in Montana where you don't have to pay for anything. The fact that you're using the internet makes me think you enjoy the material comforts that come with living in a society. And in a society there are rules and obligations that come along with those benefits.
Your high school civics teacher failed you.

If you're using something for illegal purposes, the court system is not going to help you get it back if it's taken. As in, if you were using a bolt cutter to cut bike locks and steal bikes (and the police knew about this), and then your bolt cutter was stolen, then the justice system is legally unable to help you. It's a specific statute. I remember seeing this come up on Judge Judy once.
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:32:22
Yeah, great. When can I use it?
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:49:43




Damn, you were so close.
@_date: 2016-09-08 21:06:52
I love it.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:32:43
OK, you win. I lose. Bitcoin is a currency, albeit one that nobody accepts besides ransomware creators. Even freaking Humblebundle is tired of you people.
@_date: 2016-09-08 15:35:00
It's a consequence of the casual libertarian attitude of the bitcoin community. The government is evil, except when I want to use its roads or court systems for my own advantage.

Oh wow it has its own github? Nothing posted there ever gets abandoned. 
This community is great at starting projects and giving them names. Not so great at ever finishing them.

Well, to be fair, OP doesn't say that fraud is impossible, just that the amount defrauded can't be more than what was sent. I suppose the comparison is to when a merchant charges your credit cards multiple times for a single transaction.
@_date: 2016-09-06 02:16:58
And that's assuming the hash rate doesn't go up. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 22:17:03
AOL, CompuServe, et al. Not technically the same thing as internet but functionally close enough to Joe Sixpack, and served as a gateway to anyone who wanted to go on the open net.
@_date: 2016-10-03 22:07:49


Normal people are fine with dollars for that.
@_date: 2016-10-14 02:38:10
There's really no money to be made in designing interfaces for Bitcoin. The general public just doesn't care, and the current user base seems content with the existing piss poor UI.
@_date: 2016-10-23 02:58:58
It doesn't exist, so why bother? It's like counting fins on the Loch Ness Monster. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 22:19:39
Why would anyone want it? Looks like they're processing about $5 a day in tips on Reddit, the hub if Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 03:15:13
And all I have to do is to give them all of my social media and bank account information to get it. What a deal!
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:53:57
I thought they disbanded changetip and sold off the assets.
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:27:15


Nonsense, there's buying contraband online and paying off ransomeware operators, two use cases where bitcoin excels.
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:57:31
You should probably get back to studying for your Intro to Philosophy midterm. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:06:11
Not if you get out there and suck dick for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 02:39:09
woah what just happened there?
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:30:44
It will never happen, so don't worry your pretty little head about it.

What if the users on the street didn't move online, but he just introduced drugs to a section of the population that didn't previously have access? The online portion was just the "last mile", most of the importation and high level distribution was old school. So silk road could have hypothetically increased overall demand and trafficking without reducing street level violence or demand.
@_date: 2016-10-08 23:56:37
What if Ross got a bunch of curious people hooked on drugs from the comfort of their living room and then they lost everything and now they're out there sucking dick for a fix? You ever think about that possibility?


Lol.
