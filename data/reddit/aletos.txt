51% attack is a downside inherent of doing distributed consensus.  Satoshi mentioned it being a concern in his original white paper.  So thought had gone into this as Bitcoin was created.  There isn't currently a technical solution to this problem.  Instead incentives are in place to discourage any rationale actor or group from getting majority control.  The worry is an irrational actor gaining control and disregarding all the incentives in place.  IMO irrational actors and/or misplaced incentives are the main concern of any system we create.

Did you mean 10% interest?  1% leads to only 1 extra token.

Only Ross is in the courtroom.  The rest of us can ponder such things and have a free open discussion.  
Also a discussion of this manner could occur in the courtroom as well.  Jury nullification isn't widely known or used, but it is an option.

I think it might be a tad extreme to say the risk of losing $9000 + interest is akin to financial ruin.

No, it would need a majority of the full nodes.

A few miners mean nothing if a majority of nodes reject their blocks.
