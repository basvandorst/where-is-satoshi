I personally prefer to store my wallet on a [44mb Bernoulli disk](
So obscure, no one will be able to get at my bitcoins.

Wish I found this post in high school... Oh well... 
Not sure if it would of helped as running installers where admin locked (I did manage to get dos games to run though). Or maybe it was just the 2000 and XP machines that where admin locked. It was so long ago lol.
Thanks for the heads up!

I have heard of this click of death. Luckily I never experienced it. Although I didn't really use a zip drive that much, and only had one zip disk.

Pic was not mine. However I do have an Bernoulli drive. I do have a 44mb Bernoulli disk somewhere in its protective case, but I would have to look for it.
Best I can do at the moment is Gimp (I don't have photoshop) a banana in.

Yup, this is why I only had a 32mb one. Still have it too, it has a fancy right protect switch on it

Not entirely sure how it worked really. Generally I am interested in learning WhY something like this works on a computer. But in this instance I didn't find out.
Your hypothesis on why it may of worked sounds logical though.

Thanks for pointing out my typo, I have edited my post accordingly...

I remember getting my first flash drive, and trying to use it to transport documents and print them out at my high school.
I was forced to go back to floppy disks because a ton of computers in my school were still using Windows 98SE and few computers where running Windows 2000 or XP at the time.
But yes, floppy disks... Cyclic redundancy check was a common error I got when the disk was damaged. I tried my best to keep Floppies in hard containers to protect them from data loss. I use to help people in high school with attempting to recover documents as well.
Edit: Cyrillic Redundancy Check is not a thing. But Cyclic Redundancy Check is a thing...

Yup this... They target "verge culture" which is practically younger generation of people.

I to was lured here by that ad.
I did mine before in a pool with my single 5770. now that I have two I am tempted to mine again, until I can afford to acquire some USB ASICs (Probably several block erupters)

I actually do not pay for electricity. So it would be a complete profit for me, aside from unexpected hardware failure (hope that doesn't happen). On the other hand, me using up my electric would not be nice to my landlords...
