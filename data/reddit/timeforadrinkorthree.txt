I sent some Bitcoin last night using a Trezor.
I selected custom input. I put in 40sat/b. It told me 3 days. Took less than 5 minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:30:14
Your info seems a bit off.
I was sending from Trezor to Trezor. 
Right before you send, you are given an option of how fast you want the transaction to go through. Basically, if you pay more you are at the top of the heaps for miners to select you.
You can select fast, normal, slow or custom (manual input). I did custom and entered a very low number. Low and behold, it went through quickly. Great ����
Lately, everyone has mentioned that Segwit adoption has increased and l wasn't in a rush to send this particular transaction, so l thought I'd lower it and see how it went.
I sent a fair amount of Bitcoin for very cheap and it was surprisingly fast.
I did this with 2 BTC transactions last night, and some other alt coins. All worked out well. 
Even wallet to wallet transactions still have to go through miners because blockchain is an open ledger and it still has to get processed and put on the Ledger that Person A paid Person B and everyone can see that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:33:21
Segwit adoption maybe has lowered the fees and times?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:07:33

Honestly, as someone from outside North America, I'm really surprised that Coinbase hasn't activated Segwit.
For real?
And only offers 4 coins.

Coinbase is in bed with Ver, BCash, market manipulation - all of which has evidence to prove it.

Not really. You need to dig a little deeper. The owners of Bitfinex said they had nothing to do with US Tether, turns out they were neck deep in it, they flat out lied. Look into Paradise Papers....
US Tether was also subpoenaed. Bitfinex too. 
Have a look at the amount of Tethers created too, nice whole numbers and the timing too, it was trying to prop the price of BTC up.
US Tether was also in the process of being audited when they sacked their auditor....
House of cards...
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:38:51
Would be good when exchanges allow you to set the fee for outgoing transactions.
Coinspot does this also. You have no control over the fee charged, but it's expensive.
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:00:06
Well, you never know
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:58:00
I think it means, showcus US Tether isn't a scam and let someone do an audit on it, as as promised previously. There are other dubious things that came out with the Paradise/Panama Papers

For new people entering crypto, and sending BCH to a BTC address = funds gone forever. What he did was deceitful and a con.
Also, using the website bitcoin.com to do this is deceitful because not many people know that he owns the website. It's not run by a group of people who run it in good faith, it's run by a guy who was part of a fork with greedy miners.

Holy shit. This is huge. I don't think people understand the implications of this.
Option of BTC at settlement instead of cash. 
Imagine a hedge fund making a $50 million trade and wanting BTC delivery. It will push up the price even more. I can see BTC at levels no one can imagine.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:51:56

I just ended up with a Yubikey, does it's purpose and they had a special discount on recently, so gave it a go. 5/5. ����
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:49:14
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:47:49
What was the price difference between 3rd party and official?
I think if you go to the ledger sub, they had a 30% discount on, might still be on. 
Also, delivery time could also be important, which could sway people l guess.

@_date: 2018-12-23 10:41:02
To me it would matter and l would only purchase from Ledger themselves, never a third party.
However, if you are going to try to save a few dollars and buy from unofficial 3rd parties, then I'd start with a new seed at a minimum, and also create a 25th word which l wouldn't write down anywhere, just to be a bit more secure.
