As far as I know, Avalon has not released any chips yet, so they don't have the hardware yet. And on a thread they said that they will not take any pre-orders.

I am sorry, but I don't. Someone I know is setting up a shop in Canada though.

We are a legitimate company. Since we are sourcing all the products from various distributors and vendors, we don't have a warehouse, yet. Maybe in the future.
I have no idea why our phone number is listed for that company in Wahroonga. We go this number in November, maybe they had it before that.

Also, our credit card processor is Commonwealth Bank, and trust me, they make you go through the eye of a needle before approving you.

As our press release mentioned, we are a new company. We started doing business about 5 months ago.
We have already processed many orders paid by Credit Card and Paypal. We also recently got approved by American Express, and are in the process of adding that as a payment method.
All our products are listed on Google Products:

Well, we never receive the Bitcoins as such. BitPay (out payment processor) automatically converts them to AUD and wires us the money at the end of the day. They handle the volatility (they absorb the profit and loss, if any, from change in the price).

Doesn't say anywhere on the site. Lists only credit card and paypal on the home page. I didn't complete the whole checkout process, though.

I am the owner of DigiDeals, and I'm here to answer your questions.

As mentioned in another comment, we use BitPay.

We are a new company, we are trying to tie up with more sources. In the coming months, we will have more choices.

Are you the owner of coingig? If yes, you should make a module for OpenCart. That way it will be easier for a lot of e-commerce stores, like ours, to export our product list to coingig.
