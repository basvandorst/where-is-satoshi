Hey don't bring Dogecoin into this, we were just chasing the back of your truck when you hit the brakes full stop.

Are you sure you're not a Shibe...? ;D)
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:30:12
I fully agree!
I recently started to try and bring a bunch of crypto-coins together to help fight these regs, as currently presented, because this is much bigger than just Bitcoin.  These regs are a threat to all cryptocurrency -- especially if widely adopted -- and, frankly, you all shouldn't have to face it alone.
We're just getting started but I'd love it if you would come and join us!

People seem to forget that the US Government has gone to war and worse to retain its control as the de-facto world reserve currency.
To just completely shrug off Trillions of dollars of built-up infrastructure specifically designed to maintain those policies; to think that they will just roll over and say 'well, it was nice while it lasted', is hubris in the extreme.  I have great amounts of respect for Bitcoin and all the potential that is carried within it - but some of this blind 'screw you, we're invincible' mentality that I've been seeing in response to these regulations is shocking.  
No one, nothing, is invincible.
Yes, Governments come and Governments go and Bitcoin was built to survive that - but much of its perceived value is still retained in relation to fiat.  How much one can cash Bitcoin out for.  I've yet to see any great number of shops operating by selling items for Bitcoin value alone.  They're selling things for fiat equivalent in Bitcoin, sometimes with a nominal discount to attract business.
Until shops start buying and selling in Bitcoin, irregardless of its Fiat worth, Bitcoin will not be 'free' of the system.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:30:47
Well, I'm sorry you see it that way.  That was not the intent.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:39:07
Fantastic! :D)

We have New York-based Shibes over in that want to help too.  
I'm trying to help point them in the right direction on who, specifically, might be best to try and write/contact in their government.
Any idea on where I should point them?
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:29:58


... uhhh... 2 Million+ US prisoners might disagree.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:02:49
True, but they're still Shibes - and 1200 other people still donated, without them we'd still be there, but it'd just take longer to get over the hill.

Change.org seem like good people - one problem with these sorts of efforts is that politicians tend to go 'meh' to them and send them directly to their junk mail.

Didn't Reddcoin suffer an actual 51% attack not that long ago?
(aka, theoretical if you have the network power of the BTC network but a reality if you're a young alt-coin)
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:12:56


Well, lets take the incredible level of hostility in your response as an excellent example of why that's not going to happen.
People don't want to be associated with the kind of seriousness and negativity that Bitcoin is pumping out right now.  
Do you realize how many Dogecoin adopters are former Bitcoiners?  
I'm one of them. And I'll tell you, straight up, we're people who got fed up with showing up to and such, trying to have fun and do exactly that - charitable means, etc - but got shouted down and drowned out.
Look, I get that Bitcoin is for 'real' investors - and that's fine, but don't try and stand here pointing fingers when your community has done the dirty work of chasing out people who wanted to use BTC for charitable means.
Your attitude is exactly characteristic of the problem that's plaguing Bitcoin and hurting its growth, especially amongst women and those who are not technically inclined.
You know why Dogecoin works? It's because we don't care who you are, we welcome you, share our DOGEs and actively work to help you find your footing in the cryptocurrency world.  We laugh and joke around and make learning about Finance fun and non-threatening.
Because basic Finance isn't THAT hard, in fact, it's often just a lot of really big words designed to obfuscate some really simple concepts.
You can be as angry as you want, but know that people are choosing Dogecoin specifically because Bitcoin is chasing them out the door.
I apologize for being so blunt, but that's the boots-on-the-ground reality of where you're at.  You don't have to like it - and you shouldn't - but you can fix it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:21:00


You say that as if it's a bad thing - BTC has been largely kept afloat because of people mining other coins (especially Dogecoin, consistently one of the most profitable) to buy BTC.  The rest of the world isn't using Bitcoin.  They're starting to wake up, yes, but for all the frustration about alt-coins, BTC should be quite happy that they exist, 'cause very few (who don't have the word 'incorporated' in their name) are willing to invest direct fiat into the system after China.


I wish I had wealth - most of the people who are wealthy in Dogecoin are people who converted their Bitcoins into DOGE.
The DOGE that I have is donated from my readers and about 80% of that I've given away to other causes.
I feel like you're kind of choosing to stand on the outside snarking in when there's really no reason to.  The community is open and friendly and there's more than room enough for everyone.
Guess it all depends on what matters to you...
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:57:18
That's a very interesting idea! Thank you!
The one aspect to the argument has been about people being able to maintain their anonymity with Cryptos.
Is there a way to incorporate that into this idea? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:30:20
Thanks for this!

Sometimes the best way to win isn't to be the one yelling louder but to be the one that makes them realize what a fool they're being.

Here's a snippet from our first-ever 'Dogecoin Party' -- pretty much the equivalent of a Dogecoin 'conference'.
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:55:37
I just want to say, I really appreciate that the Bitcoin community has re-embraced tipping.  You guys all started the trend way back in the day and, in using it, I've found it to be a truly great way to help build both positivity and community.
That said, I do really agree with in that it, like any compliment that matters, a tip works best when given for an actual, specific, appreciation.  A comment you liked or an engaging conversation or a piece of art or whatnot.
We've had issues with this in the Dogecoin community as well, with people just tipping randomly for no reason, and  it's something that I kind of campaign against because it tends to not only dilute the true meaning of one's intention, but bring out the kind of people that just scrounge for errant tips.
In my personal experience, I've found that, often, it's much less about the 'amount' and far, far more about a clear intention and appreciation you're displaying when you give the tip.
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:59:40
What about the fact that this is most likely a test-bed case?  New York state is not some backwater small-time part of the world - I'm certain that a lot of eyes will be watching to see how this plays out.
Meaning that if these regulations are put in, unopposed, then other states/nations might see that as an example worth following.
It's hard to enforce if it's just one state.  But 15? Or 30? Or the entire EU?
That's why we've been trying to build a united crypto-front to challenge the regulations as they've been presented.
So far I've brought some of and to the table and will be reaching out to other communities as well.
The 45-day open comment period doesn't start until the 23rd so now's the time to build and plan a proper, united response.
Because this is bigger than just one state and bigger than just one coin. 
This is a potential threat to all cryptocurrency.
And we should stand together! 
@_date: 2014-08-20 04:19:41
Indeed it does! The trick, IMHO, is in getting a supply chain running first - need to get the people who are the entry points to accept cryptos and work from there.  Ie: getting farmers to accept crypto for the things that they sell, then them being able to easily use that crypto to help better their lives, re-buy supplies themselves online, etc.
I think food is probably the easiest way to start and the best way to get crypto working there is to offer them 10% above USD market price for it in crypto.  
If you buy their products in crypto, offer them ways to exchange crypto for good/services that they need, that's how you can start to build supply chains.
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:48:28
We're very different communities in some ways... But there's still a ton of common ground for us to come together on. Especially with this issue.

LOL! Well, that's one way of doing it ;D)
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:15:16
It's a bit of a process - we tend to go through cycles of seriousness and silliness.  We end up too silly, the serious shibes tend to take over, we end up to serious, the silly shibes start to bring out fun content to lighten the mood.
This summer has been bad for pretty much all the alts, but yeah, there's something to be said for getting back to our roots.  ;D)
Thanks for the kind words - it seems that we're still figuring out what works and what doesn't.
But we'll find our way though, I'm sure of it.
All the best to you,

We've been working hard to be the 'Friendly Face' of the Digital Currency Revolution.  We're helping new people, less tech-savvy people get involved; explaining the system to them, letting them play a bit without losing their shirts in the process.
And then they're free to learn about all the other coins, buy some Bitcoin, buy some Litecoin, whatever.  But at least they got their feet wet in a safe, friendly, caring environment before they chose to step into the big money.
Dogecoin is happy to be the 'My first crypto' to a host of new users and we're actively taking the time to work with newbies on a one-on-one, case by case basis... so far, it seems to be working. :D)

@_date: 2014-07-28 00:08:03
Well, I was thinking that it's less about *them* and more about *them* putting the screws to NY-based businesses that would like to work with Bitcoin.  Yes, it's easy to talk about people and businesses just 'leaving' New York behind, but it's not quite as easy as all that.
Individual users? Sure.  Legitimate businesses that might actually help take Bitcoin mainstream? Not so much.
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:46:57

I think it behooves us all to work together.  We don't have to hold hands and sing Kumbaya, but I think we can affect greater, more positive change, together.
Thank you very kindly for the tip! It's much appreciated!
May I tip you some Dogecoins in return?
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:42:48

@_date: 2014-07-18 20:44:01


I fully agree with this - coming up with that message is the trick.  Even better if we can find a message that has a call-to-action for non-crypto people as well.  This is, in some ways, indicative of the apparent 'spy-first, catch'em later' attitude of the Government.
And the overreach is... well, kind of frightening to be honest.


Also agreed.  Regulations were always in the cards for BTC (And cryptos) the moment they started to become recognized as 'real' money.  The trick is finding that balance.
I really like the Git-hub fork idea of the crypto regulations and I think that should sort of be our 'banner' of sorts, when those involved ask about 'demands', etc.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:43:05
That's one way to do it.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:39:19

@_date: 2014-03-22 14:53:59


We already are though.  Ripples in the pond, sure, but our ripples are making waves.
Dogecoin is ~4 months old and we're getting attention and holding it because what we're doing, specifically, is changing things.  Small, sure, but it's happening -- and being hard-coded into the fabric of our sub.
Sure, we'll see where we are in 1 year, but, for now, what we're doing is working.
And we're changing the face of Crypto because of it.
Business isn't the only answer.  I know that sounds ridiculous if that's the whole of your world, but it's not.  We're proof of that.  Our coin is being heavily transacted, used, shared with almost no real place to spend it.  Because we believe, heartily, in the ideas of showing appreciation and thanks.
We're not going to be a $1000 coin -- and I think that's a key difference that you're forgetting.
As we grow in utility and market cap we're going to see more 'business' types jumping on, sure, but you have to realize that we'll be lucky if we ever see 10 cents per coin.  Especially once all the whales start cashing out, we'll be lucky to hold onto 1 cent.
I don't think it's going to unfold quite the way you're envisioning.
But the future is a fickle thing.  We shall see.
Thank you kindly for taking the time to chat with me ;D)
All the best to you and yours!
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:38:54

That's a pretty sweeping generalization but point taken.  No one's saying you have to talk like that to be part of the community - it's mostly meant as something fun and light-hearted.
If that's not your speed, well, there's no one forcing you to 'talk silly'.  It's an individual choice, just as like choosing which color of shirt you're going to wear.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:58:30

The world is tough enough out there as it is.
Take your wins, count your blessings and never apologize for doing a good deed.  ;D)

Well, to be fair, we have kind of forked it in a whole different direction.
I mean, of we were running around with an exact clone of the Bitcoin QT, calling ourselves CitCoin... yeah, I'd get it.
But we've gone down a somewhat different path and tried to make it our own.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:14:41

New York State is a very large center of commerce to turn one's back on. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:17:16


But, to be fair, I don't think you have to 'control' anything.  It's about doing the most you can with what you have.
Dogecoin may be worth fractions of pennies, but the community has consistently come together to make real-world positive change (and some general silliness, but that's what helps keep things fun).
The BTC community, with its incredible marketcap/valuation, could be doing this kind of thing and more.  I, personally, love what you all have done re: Sean's Outpost -- I think it's absolutely admirable and I hope to see even more!
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:44:31
Huh? I'm not denying anyone anything, I'm actually trying to help.  How is what I wrote about have anything to do with being 'in it for the money'?  
Remittance is good, but the people who're receiving the crypto need a place, locally, to spend it.  Something that can have a notable impact on their daily lives.
Bringing poor farmers online with crypto allows other poor people a legitimate place for them to buy food with their crypto.
Otherwise, what good is crypto to poor people if they can't actually spend it on things they need?  
Poor people need to eat, crypto is readily available and can be easily shared online and between one another no matter one's location.
Thing is, why would a farmer be sold on crypto over USD which they KNOW has value?  So, one way to bring them on board might be to offer them 10% more over their crops' regular market price in USD value.
I don't see how anything I've written there makes me 'in it for the money'...
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:32:31
That's okay.  All we can do is try and offer our hand in friendship.
If it's not wanted, that's okay too, there are other ways for us to help. :D)
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:30:22
There's talk of a digital protest march/party right now... I think we're trying to figure out if that's viable or not.
Otherwise, lots of room for ideas!  Don't be worried about if they're bad or good (I have lots of stinkers too) they'll all help lead us down the right path eventually ;D)

These are great! Thanks for sharing!
It's interesting to hear him talk about how everything is provable on BTC and yet to hear him talk about how Dark Wallet and Zero Cash are important.
I mean, I get that it's good to have options -- which is what this is about -- but if given a choice between using a 'truly, mathematically provable' anonymous system and a system where every transaction is public and follow-able (assuming the right conditions are met)... what's the impetus for anyone to use the public system?
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:41:51
Look at all the laws the US was willing to break in order to do the MPAA/RIAA's bidding against Kim Dotcom.  Once the regulations/laws are in place it's even harder to change them without serious lobbying money.
This public commenting period is as good a chance as we'll have to try and fix this up.
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:29:11

Seems to be working out pretty well for us though!
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:40:45

I don't know what's gotten into some of these Shibe's heads, but we're going to have a good long talk about this.
Some newbs don't yet know that Dogecoin tips are considered insults here - so they'll be taught.
And those who know and choose to do it anyway... well, we'll have to figure that one out.
I understand the anger being thrown my way, that's fine, I accept it.  
All I can do is try.

Thanks!!  Upvoted!

Hey, thank you, friend for your kind words... but I ask for nothing that is not given freely.  Just because I have your respect, doesn't mean I don't have to earn theirs :D)

You don't have to 'like' us to want our help.  We're not just 'Dogecoin', we're people too and we're wanting to help our BTC friends.
If you personally don't want the help from an entire other community just because you don't like a dog on a coin... okay... I guess.
But this thing that Bitcoin is facing is bigger than all of us and blowing raspberries at the New York State Department of Financial Services... isn't going to get anyone very far.
Anyway, I appreciate that it's fun to slag on Dogecoin folks, and that's fine... but the offer is genuine.

As per technical innovation only, I would agree we haven't moved much.  But in social innovation, changing how cryptos can be viewed, I think we're blazing trails of our own.
And thanks much for the well-wishes ;D)
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:01:37
Yeah, I plan to ;D)
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:36:12
This is such a fantastic idea! Great work!
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:20:13
Well, to be fair, we *can* be kind of ridiculous.  That's what makes us fun.  We do serious, we do silly.  We tend to be dual-natured like that.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:05:27
I'm sure our Dogecoin core devs would be happy to help out if there were any concerns.  They're really cool people and they've done a ton of excellent work with our coin :D)
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:49:33
Hrmm, I wonder how 1-minute blocks would affect Bitcoin overall?
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:52:12
Why does BTC even care about Alts?  Different Algo entirely, no threat at all to the BTC network - Actually, now that I think about it, isn't the whole point of a 'free market' to allow the consumer to decide for themselves what they want to use?
Forcing Bitcoin down people's throats - demanding to be the 'only' option - well, IMHO, it's no different than the US forcing USD down everyone's throats. 
Put the options out there, let the people decide what they want to use.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:37:38
Well, with respect, I would disagree, of course.
Right off the bat the first and most notable change is that we're an open-ended coin while Bitcoin is Deflationary.
We're adding 5.25 Billion coins per year in the long haul.
That's a pretty notable -- and coin-changing -- difference.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:44:14
Sure, fair point. Aka, an actual currency. :D) 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:15:38
Absolutely. Dogecoin solved the vast majority of these issues a long time ago and just keeps padding along. Hugely under-valued IMHO, but that's fine by me. Lots of time to stock up before the next leap forward.
@_date: 2016-11-19 01:33:37
Dogetipbot has been one of the best things to ever happen to Dogecoin - hope you're doing well :D)

Ahhh, okay. Weird, I guess it must've got overshadowed by the price rise? I don't remember seeing any promo for it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:44:07
Yes, thank you!
I guess my point was that I haven't seen much promo for it around the sub.
It's cool that the price is on the rise, but I'd love to see lots more shout outs/promo/love going toward the stalwart Bitcoin Merchants who, I'm sure, could stand to see their pockets bulge a bit with bits. ;D)
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:15:54
Realistically, BTC is over $5K again because people are moving their coins out of alts and into BTC to prepare for 2x -- same thing happened with BCash. Move everything over, see how the smoke clears, take/sell your free coins, diversify again... pretty standard movement these days.
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:20:18
Well, to be fair there's an entire segment of the populace that actually believes that the world is flat and vaccines cause autism... I suspect Mr. Dimon's aiming to hit home somewhere in the midst of that fertile ground.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:25:42
Yeah, welcome to the wild west -- in a cryptosphere specifically designed to remain that way. We want things unregulated but then get snippy when predators jump into the pool and start biting people.
Sometimes when I'm bored I'll just sit on Poloniex for a while and watch the bots in action.
But this is the way we specifically want things -- utter freedom includes the freedom to destroy as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:44:44
Yeah, education in this sector is crucial. I've been here a while now and had my fair share of burns along the way. I'm all for trying to make sure those just coming in aren't getting snookered in the process -- and really, it's a great test for the cryptosphere as a whole because if the ecosystem can't sustain itself without this economic vampirism then it really shouldn't exist. (JFC if I see another ICO this year I might just blow a brain stem).
IMHO, we should all be favoring and pushing for education in place of regulation. All that while continuing to encourage and promote products that allow us to better fulfill the vision of each person becoming their own financial pillar in society. (Hardware wallets, etc)

1 DOGE = 1 DOGE
But an $11 DOGE isn't a bad day's work to be sure. 10,000 DOGE per minute certainly takes on a different tone then, for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:08:07
True, true!
Sounds like there's lots of room to grow to me ;D)

Dogecoin actually works hand in hand with Bitcoin - especially because, right now, you can only really exchange DOGE for BTC many people who want to get into BTC are coming in through DOGEs.
This is true of all the Alts.  BTC should be happy to have them, because pretty much every alt is tied to BTC - and many users are using them as vehicles to get into BTC - it's only making Bitcoin stronger in the long run.
Like a properly diversified portfolio.  BTC is becoming seen as 'less risk' compared to the ALTs, which are far, far more volatile (DOGE being an excellent example).
DOGE has the benefit of having caught the spark of public imagination - it's friendly, non-threatening and the high market cap means you'll never be counting scraps to make a coin.
BTC's greatest weakness is psychological.  People hate change.  They hate decimal places.  They hate only having '1' of something.
1 BTC or 1 Million DOGEs?
There's something far more psychologically satisfying about that.
And that's one of the reasons that DOGE is going to be here for the long haul.  Non-threatening, easy to get, easy to share.
We're not trying to be Bitcoin - we don't want to be Bitcoin.
This is the Internet.  It's a fun place.  
Internet money should be fun.
And that's Dogecoin's greatest strength as a currency.
PS: There's an excellent initiative that needs more promotion - maybe you can help: Save Dogs with DOGE - donating our currency to help feed/care for lost and sick Dogs.  Take a look, I think it's a noble cause.
