Don’t know what’s going to happen. Just saying that at reasonable buy in levels and a goal of anti inflation you can see a crash reasonably fast enough to stop loss and still be OK. Riding it as a money train is a different thing entirely.

While the transactions are in the mempool their order is not guaranteed. If you changed the address to an index you’d still have to map it to something, wouldn’t you? Then you’d have to store that on chain and the hash lookup would increase the size.

Alright, sorry. There’s a lot of cookie cutter snark posts popping up here, it’s hard to find the real stuff.

Yes, personally, I see it as akin to a tax free savings account that you pay capital gains on. I’d rather have my money parked in BTC than fiat if I’m going to leave it alone for awhile. I know this is contentious and there’s a lot of “Store of Value” chatter that I don’t have enough depth of understanding to see all sides correctly. 
But it seems that in its current state that Layer 1 is for hedging against inflation. We will see how Layer 2 performs for cash scenarios in the future.

I have the background, skills and experience to do this, but I don’t have access to the liquidity required or the capital to retain a lawyer with the necessary experience to navigate the OSC and various other entities.

Not true, swapping two different coins is taxable based on the cost basis of the swap. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:53:11
That assumes the utility people see in it is based on counter transactions. If people see it as an account they can put money into that protects it from inflation, it doesn’t necessarily need to be more than that.

It’s mining, it’s in the middle of the pack profitability-wise, but it’s chugging along. Available on suprnova pool.

This is the first place I went. There are no rollups for solution level decisions historically. Was hoping to avoid reading 8 years of commit logs but that’s what beer is for.

I haven’t had any bad experiences with either personally, other than the UX stinks.

Because it’s predictably volatile as long as you’re not trying to day trade. The gains made during price discovery only have to average out higher than inflation plus the long position capital gains, and that happened ages ago. If nothing else it’s doing this job very well.

Bittrex and Cryptopia are the ones I know first hand. Market list should be on coinmarketcap.

Hopefully that data isn’t available, people shouldn’t be sharing their xpub keys.

My bad. User experience (UX). How they are designed, lag, etc. Most exchanges look like a developer made them.

You certainly sound like the true found. Looking forward to the opening of your identity, Nakamoto-san.

There is probably a way to start an “ethical ICO” to raise the funds in crypto. I am as exhausted as the next person with ICOs in general but it makes sense to put the order book on a blockchain, and it makes sense to self-create some form of liquidity even if it’s basically a loyalty token.

It’s a double-edged sword, because forking the proof of work also means Bitcoin is no longer the most secure network, unless it can attract the majority of the GPU mining market to switch.
This is highly unlikely at the current ludicrous difficulty levels, since there are far more attractive coins to mine.

Ordering in. Ordering. In.

If there was a sniff of this being plausible the proof of work function would be forked overnight.
(point being is Bitcoin is what everyone agrees it is, worst case scenario is pulling a DAO fork reversal, it wouldn’t be “bye bye”)

It’s not too complex for one person. It’s not even complex for one very good netcode programmer. It’s just unfamiliar concepts which are not common to business software developers.

Bitcoin.tax can’t parse Bittrex well, it thinks I have dozens of coins I already sold. Cointracking is painful since it doesn’t support a lot of readonly API keys it should. Im just going to build my own for personal use this year because I don’t trust either one’s final output.

I will keep, I will keep! Good luck with the discovery, sounds rough. We are here for you.

Saying peer to peer is directing the solution. Technical people have a hard time talking a layer above the solution. In this case the solution dictates the design without requiring a third party.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:50:58
There was an attempt.

Can you link to resources? I thought this already happened.

But not a real monkey, that’s cruel.

Neither, both have critical bugs, at least when I used them, I have to program my own tool to do it properly.

Can anyone point to the proof that Craig's Tulip Trust was actually Mt. Gox cold wallets and not the early wallets attributed to Satoshi?
It's plausible that Craig and David and Hal are Satoshi. It's also possible that Satoshi is Hal, and David and Craig formed the first Bitcoin mining enterprise which accounts for the "Satoshi" bitcoins, and Bitcoin's inventor(s) didn't mine near as much. 
I don't understand why Satoshi would create Bitcoin and then solo mine such a large stake, since that would be a blow against greater adoption and decentralization. It seems more plausible to me that Hal Finney was Satoshi and simply worked on the technology, and that Craig and David formed a mining collective together since David was a member of the forum where the whitepaper was posted and would have told his co-author friend about it. Maybe they were the very first miners.
I wonder also if anyone has "done the math" to see how long it would have taken to mine the Satoshi wallets with period hardware and the speed it was mined and come up with a dollar figure as to how much it would have cost. If it's a significant sum, it seems even less likely that Satoshi would have had that inclination or means as an academically minded entity to treat his/her/it's decentralized project like an investment opportunity, at least by appearances. Whereas it makes more sense that two security consultants with resources would get into mining.
I am slightly worried that the "Wait for 2020" idea is that Craig would gain access, or authority, to move those early coins (regardless of whether they are actually Satoshi's or Mining Prime) on January 1st, 2020, triggering a massive sell-off of Bitcoin (possibly in favour of another fork).
On the other hand, if Craig really is Satoshi and faked his disgrace to hide in plain sight and support a fork, then I would have expected more effort on the PoW versus the block size, given the current climate. Satoshi today would probably have an opinion about the centralization of mining, even if the miners provide the most security network in the world today.

Yes, if it’s centralized the authentication scheme of the database protects resources, “proof of identity” gets you in.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:08:50
Eh, there is some peripheral utility in a centralized private blockchain if you’ve ever done complex event processing, it’s basically an event store you can verify with Merkel trees. So it’s a step above rolling your own event store.

Any programmer who works in distributed systems would recognize that the technology isn't incredible at all. It's an assortment of well known solutions built on older technology and mostly solved problems (in the case of consensus, "good enough" is good enough). There's nothing special about it. The economics is what makes it useful, and most developers don't know a thing about economics.

He was/is a bitcoin developer so for starters. So you owe this snark post to him in some way. 
Also, if he had that many bitcoins there’s a good chance he’s still got enough to make a difference in his life, and if not he did something notable. No pizza, no bitcoin.
Lastly, and perhaps most important, it was two pizzas, not “a pizza”.
For all we know he’s the creator of the PineappleFund or the ice cream army. 
Be nice!
