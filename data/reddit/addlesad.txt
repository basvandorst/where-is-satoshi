Both are zero.
One of these 2 scenarios happened:
1) I used Multibit Classic and it did address change automatically on  Nov 11 after I exported .key file earlier that year. I kept using new address unaware that it's new address + I created MultiBit HD wallet but didn't use it.
2) I used Multibit Classic and moved my bitcoin to MultiBit HD on  Nov 11 myself.
MultiBit HD wallet words opened empty wallet, so I assume first scenario is most likely.

I used wallet words and it opened wallet which has 0 balance. Thats why I'm not sure if I even sent coins to HD wallet. Maybe I just created wallet, saved wallet words and didn't even use it. And coins were sent only using Classic. Or I just entered wallet words some how incorrectly, or they are corrupted. 
I have date stamp, is it possible to convert it to see when wallet was created? This way I could figure out if I even used HD wallet.

Not sure, I think Classic made it itself. I used one of these wallets until Jul 16, 2015.

I imported .key file in Multibit Classic and it contained address that I used until November 11th. Last and only transaction on that date is to the new address. Classic doesn't autmatically create new addresses? If so then I probably updated to HD and moved it there myself?

I don't have access to my bitcoin. Balance is 0, that should make it incorrect?

.key file have one address. I deleted all wallet folders.

Not sure if I made it. And it's definitely not a hack.
Here is transaction.
I used new address til Jul 16, 2015. But not sure on Classic or HD.

Synced both wallets. I only used wallet words for HD wallet, I don't think you can import keys there.

I don't have private key for new address. Can some parts of private key for the new address be inside encrypted multibit .key file that i created before Nov 11?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:41:11
It has only one address that I created before Nov 11.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:52:36
It's correct. Same as in block explorer.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:35:34
Already installed Multibit HD, used restore tool and tried all 3 options. It opens one address with no transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:15:35
I meant balance is correct for the address I have access to 14p2yJvMeuZiujsymBDKhU6sjcCMTJjwC6. It's 0. I don't have access to 14wXpgPFWbJvDtatoSA9eeEUrFfeaEsHAN, but it was mine.

ECB did. Bank of Latvia issued it yesterday. They are laging behind.

And one day before this warning Airbaltic, which is 99.8% owned by Latvian state, started to accept Bitcoin.
