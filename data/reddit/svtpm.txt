@_date: 2018-02-25 00:25:34
How would I do it on kraken? Leverage a sell order??
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:52:15
I think those darn silly miners lost your order, can you send more 4.5 more bitcoins?
Thank you bye
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:46:53
Ok well let's just see. In like 3 to 4 hours check the price
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:13:04
I don't know what it will drop to but I know it will be 10k tonight before dropping to low 9k tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:58:20
Do you know the sun's gonna rise tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:52:08

@_date: 2018-02-24 19:59:38

@_date: 2018-02-25 00:36:08
I know I'm not going to die today but I know I'm not going to die today yknow
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:50:51
I want to short bitcoin.
Anyone know where I could?
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:59:00
Where do you see begging in my post?
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:27:28
arent they a scam
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:02:33
Not at this rate, but I'll let u know.
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:11:51
What exchange is that? I want to short so bad.
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:30:15
Are yall ready to dip past 6400! It should happen in less than 8 hours.
My short positions can't wait, I've been waiting 2 days for the price to budge, and now we've finally got enough momentum going!!
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:11:27
Nah bitcoin is something else than all the other stocks. As long as it keeps changing price drastically, theres "gold" to be made. Once it finally stabilizes it's going to be boring.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:36:40
I just told you whats going to happen...
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:00:55
I get what you're saying but the avalanche already started. We've been in slowly descending free fall since 10k broke.
 I still think btc is going to be hella lot, just need to go below the last point then swing up. 
Or maybe not and bitcoin ends up being a fad cuz taxes are still tied to them.
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:54:19
Ur loss
