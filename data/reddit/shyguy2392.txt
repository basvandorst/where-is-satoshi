I mean I paid about a 6% fee so that’s still not TOO BAD
@_date: 2018-09-25 09:37:41
Shy guy?

No I put in $20 and received $18.25 worth of bitcoin. I ended up doing the math and it was actually 8.75%. Not bad for the novelty and convenience.   
  
I’ve already invest a bit into crypto. Just never like this.

Taking one for the team, bud.

The cashier said he gets about 35 people a day depositing there. Could be complete bs but you never know.

It wasn’t a fee on top of the markup. The markup is the fee.

To each his own. I bought through this route for the novelty of buying through an ATM. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 10:53:07
Look into coinbase (or any online crypto exchange) or find a local ATM like this one.

Quick deposit of your cash without using a bank. Especially if your banks don’t let you have transactions with exchanges like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:09:02
Well I can’t do quick math apparently. It was 8.75% 
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:41:29
Yeah I can’t see myself doing this on the regular because of the fees but I had to test it out for the novelty. Though, for putting in a $20 and only getting charged $1.75 isn’t too hateful. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:42:39
It was more like 6%
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:08:37
Didn’t think about that before.

Hey man how about an update?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:06:51
Scared me straight. Putting my BTC and XRP on my ledger tonight.   
  
Good luck friend, hope it is resolved. Let me know how I️ can help.

Can I️ ask where / when you started in crypto? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:13:38
What’s your reasoning  for thinking the pump would be that specific time? BCH has been rising all day so it’s possible
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:44:30
Scared money don’t make money!

Same...Mine should be coming Wednesday!

In all seriousness what is the likelihood that BTC runs up to 1MIL?

I have been told and read so many different explanations of the upcoming fork and how the split will affect my BTC. First it was keep my BTC off Coinbase and move to ledger because the ledger will automatically update with firmware to provide me the other coins. Now I’m reading to just dump it all back into Coinbase? I feel like there are some company reps amongst us trying to get the BTC into their field. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:07:45
I’ve got my BTC on a ledger. Will I also be given the bitcoin gold, and 2x? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:24:09
I’ve dabbled in day trading before and I was average in it. Made some good and some bad trades. But I feel like BTC is  another level and Alt coins are the penny stocks of their time. So much could be had if timed right.   
  
Edit: to your reply...that’s not bad idea. Maybe it will take me a few bad trades to appreciate hodling. Thanks.

I read that you can look up the hardware code on ledgers website and crack open the back of the one you have to check and make sure there’s no added chips/hardware.  Probably Will be doing that when mine arrives
