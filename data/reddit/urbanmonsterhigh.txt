But non of the alts are dropping...  Everything is rising with BTC (some alts are even going at a faster rate).

Are you in America?  If so you most likely owe more taxes
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:31:08
They said the same thing about BTCash and look what happened...
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:08:38
And I bet all his idiot followers are menists lol.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:13:56
any updates?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:47:55
is it crashing to the moon or somethin cause...
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:18:53
Well that's a start. We still need him to visit more reputable platforms though like CNN and Fox.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:27
I thought it was just the corny way of saying hold.  Like how people say pron instead of porn
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:22:55
You missed the key point, "due to major tech issues".  If this was just a random dip I wouldn't have said anything, but when the cause and effect is clearly evident someone needs to take responsibility and dispell the FUD.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:01:51
leave it there till your 18th birthday.  4 yrs may seem like a long time but trust its gonna fly by!  At least it does in your 20's.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:45
Don’t jinx it, at least let it sit there for a couple of hours before you crack open the bottles

recreational drug use is for gamblers
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:42:43
Lite coin had been dead for weeks tho.  It’s only good for buying verge, the new Instagram 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:00
$2k really isn't much imo.  The gambler in me would hold, but once I'm close to the break even mark I'd sell.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:04:44
Why not both?  (Insert taco commercial gif here)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:06:02
Thank you, some of these guys sound like cult leaders lol.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:11:08
You've got pretty good odds of making a profit in the long run so I wouldn't say its as dumb as buying a lottery ticket.  Still, if you can't afford to lose your investment then it was dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:44:20
It would appear so.  For all intents and purposes MySpace has better features than Facebook, but the marketing and hype made Facebook takeover.  It’s best to just buy a bit of bcash just to be safe
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:54
I think its always worth it to make extra money, especially if it requires little to no work.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:12:51
They didn't address the rape that BTC has endured in the media tho.  Until the BTC team starts doing some major PR of its own everyone should be panicking.  Weak hands from a random dip is one thing.  Weak hands during a dip due to tech issues that aren't being addressed is another.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:53:18
That’s not what the public will think. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:57:38
It doesn't make sense to hold when you could sell and buy even more bitcoin within 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:30:05
But Ripple has a much higher Market Cap than the ones you mentioned, so doesn't that mean it has more room to reach bitcoin numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:48:54
Be honest, you want it to drop to the pits of hell��
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:21:09
The minute I can’t break even I’m selling like a street walker! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:10:43
Some people actually pay their credit cards in full at the end of every month.  Since most credit cards have some type of rewards program it becomes a no brainer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:08:12
This guy was clearly using clickbait for his title, but I don't blame you all for being confused and attacking him.  That's the risk you take when you clickbait.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:14:23
If you feel confident then go for it!  Its funny how everyone warning you about how BTC could drop in an instant are the same ones expecting it to reach 100k by the end of the yr lol.  Lets be real, if they were rally that unsure about BTC's future they would have withdrawn already.  What sense does it make to continue investing money and time into a bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:12:56
Why do you care?  You already wrote it off years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:05:08
Its been hovering around 16k all day, I would say this is the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:17:45
That explains the drop from 15k to 11k.  How do you explain the drop from 19k to 15k while every other crypto was rising?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:08:28
You are just as bad as the cult followers of "Hodl".  
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:38:09
we already hit below it for hours...

We no longer live in a society where we memorize passwords or phone numbers.  Everything is saved to our devices memories.  Expecting people to write down a password and remember where they store it is like asking a millennial to use a map instead of gps.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:00
flash sale or going out of business sale?  ugh, I don't know why I'm so pessimistic when I'm still holding my damn self.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:21
What is special about the 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:24:45
So if we only sell a portion, how do we calculate our profit when most of us bought bitcoin multiple times at different prices?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:32:47
I don't need him to speak to me personally, I need him to speak to the masses!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:17
Why does it being under a year matter?  Is there some sort of rule where if you invest for over a year that you don't have to pay taxes or you pay less?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:22
I was waiting for him to come back down...
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:02:45
Its supposed to have a huge dip on the 18th I think.  I saw jonat3 say it in another thread I'll see if i can find it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:55
But isn't it far more likely for people to lose a hardware wallet than it is their online wallets to be hacked?  At least with an online wallet you will eventually get your money back if it is indeed hacked, isn't that right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:54:17
Damn, so do you have to pay extra taxes now?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:15:59
Can you blame them?  We've been on the decline for a week due to major tech issues and yet BTC as a whole has been completely silent.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:15:04
You probably shouldn’t have switched everything.  Why not just put half into bcash they way you don’t have to go from one team to another lol.  I’m like the Swiss baby, this is just a show for me
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:30:22
Gay people don’t post here so your joke will go unnoticed 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:50
You never know, the only reason bitcoin is so high in the first place is because of name recognition.  Now that this new coin is gaining fast and has a similar name whose to say this isn’t a MySpace/Facebook situation.  I would put some money into bcash and watch it all play out...
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:02:42
Don't blame me, blame the lack of organization and reach that these BTC developers have to the General Public!  I don't know a thing about crypt technology but thanks to that Ver guy I know everything that is wrong with BTC at the moment and everything that is right with his coin.  If BTC wants to stay in the game they need to take note and hire some charismatic charlatan to go on a press tour or at the very least send out a clear statement addressing all major concerns.  
You guys might not like investors who are mostly in it for gains, but without us you'd be in the 3k's.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:51:47
You know how it is, always waiting for the better offer haha.  But you are right, I should put in a little bit everyday until another big drop happens.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:50:28
That's true, but the opinion on the drop last weekend was unanimous.  I did see people disagreeing that there would be another drop tho. I should have put all my money in when I had the chance :(
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:46:36
But what if the episode does more damage than good?  They might end up making the characters lose a lot of money..
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:30:28
Too late for what exactly?  If you keep making modest investments then I guess it will be too late to see any real profits, but if you invest 5 figures I'm sure you will be a millionaire in no time!
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:41
I'm referring to their smart phone.  They have long been outclassed by other companies but because they were the first to become popular at what they do they will always be in the lead.  When you think of smart phone you think of Iphone and when you think of Crypto you think of Bitcoin.  We might get a competitor in the distant future but Bitcoin will have to be mainstream for that to happen
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:45
We are actually at the dip right now, shouldnt be long before we are at 25k
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:15:23
Apple has taught us that it doesn't matter if you do it better, it only matters if you do it first.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:59:41
We are in a dip right now so its the perfect time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:16:36
It was around 9700 yesterday and now its at 9200
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:37:46
Not if the money train is ending when you jump in late.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:47:43
But people predicted the drop that happened last weekend so you can't just write people off imo.   
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:27:09
That depends on how much profit you have made sis.  Are you in the 7 figure range already?  If so then sell like your life depends on it because the potential gains wouldn't be worth the potential loss.  Now if you are only profiting in the 5 figure range you might be better off withdrawing here and there but holding the majority.  So, in order to help you I have to know where you stand in bitcoin. (Don't actually tell me I'm just kidding about that part).
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:13:24
Its the smartest method imo, but people here have a vested interest in people holdring so you won't get a honest response.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:23:05
The smartest option would be to wait for the dip once it hits 10k.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:48:27
I guess that was a bit of a stretch, heres hoping for a quick 5k dip tho!
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:53:24
Bread wallet is good on iphone
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:35:57
So if we bought during the 8-9k peak should we also sell at 10k, and then buy the dip?  Did this happen at the 5k mark or is 10k the only moon for some people?
