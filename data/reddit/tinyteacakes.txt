It looks like any coins bought before a HF are fine on a paper wallet or Trezor. But some exchanges may have T&amp;Cs that mean they only recognise one fork, I think. So best to keep them off exchanges.

Good question. And how does it affect users of Trezor and paper wallets?

Is it just me or is a Bitcoin debate on highly censored/controlled Chinese mainstream TV extremely significant? This, in tandem with the PBOC trying to act as a stabilising force on BTC...... Veeeelly intelesting 
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:27:04
I'd rather not go into that as I'm no good at being ridiculed. Suffice to say was my fault. But if BTC is to go mainstream there will have to be third parties involved. At present the technicalities involved in being 100% secure are too big a hurdle for the vast majority of people.
For the record I quickly bought back in after learning about paper wallets.

Now I say zilch. It's impossible to convey what Bitcoin is to people that doesn't end up in a conversation about the nature of money. People want money-yes. People want to know where money originates and what it is- no.

Are you sure it isn't their goal? Why are they so concerned about volatility then? 
I believe that the Chinese see themselves as a world leader in a new technology and they want to shepherd it in a responsible manner by restricting manipulation and fraud (as well as capital flight of course).
The Chinese government has even encouraged it's population to acquire PMs as a hedge against an inflationary currency. They seem to want the best for their people. Or am I being naive?

If we're talking about the egregious currency slave system afflicting the world that foments wars and misery and how bitcoin is a potential antidote it's extremely relevant.

Either that or Bitcoin is a colossal psy-op created by (((them))).

The storytellers in any society have enormous power. Hume stated the the captain of our logic sits on the elephant of our passions. Wherever our elephant goes, our logic has to go with it.

True. But once regulation surrounding BTC is entrenched and major outlets will only accept BTC from validated accounts isn't the dream of true liberty quashed? Immutable if legal. Where did you get the coins? Let us check the history of the coins you own. These coins are from questionable sources we must requisition them while we investigate. The world currency controlled by government we dread. If there are options for anonymity then it's business as usual for the shady corrupt powers that be whereas us plebs are looking at jail time for anonymous 'terrorist' transactions.

Zerohedge comments are a good barometer for how the investing community perceives BTC. There are a lot of PM bugs with their noses out of joint at the moment and they're not happy about BTC. But, slowly but surely, you can see more and more of them taking BTC seriously and some of them are beginning to dip their toes in the crypto space. There is still a vocal hardcore who want to see BTC fail but at least their arguments against crypto are becoming more sophisticated and we're moving on from tulips, "can't hold it in my hand" and EMPs.

If the 99% of people who haven't put money into crypto see bitcoin has failed, they won't touch any crypto with a 10 ft barge pole.
BTC is a protocol and can evolve.
The model T wasn't presented as a store of value. Yes, BTC wasn't either, but as this field progresses people are seeing it as one and if a lot of people lose their shirts because bitcoin fails then the world of crypto will remain a speciality field for programmers and the finance industry.
Bitcoin losing it's market share because every man and his dog are creating new altcoins every week is not something that worries me if I'm honest. People diversify into alts to make quick money in shallow markets. My guess is that, over time, they will fall away as bitcoin evolves and people return to the mothership.
