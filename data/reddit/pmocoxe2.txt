I haven't used google in a long time.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:46:09
I expected more from you.

I thought the wallet.dat contains a pool of change addresses that will be used for future transactions? So unless he made so many transactions to exhaust that pool he should have all the change backed up already. I think you can even set the pool size to like thousands of addresses.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:50:26
Shut up. Nobody is buying this crap anymore. Literally.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:02:03
That was too much in bad taste to be funny.
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:44:40
I haven't spent much btc lately, the price is too low for that.
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:34:16
You might be confusing livejasmin with chaturbate.. they started accepting bitcoin maybe a year ago but then stopped for unknown reasons. Livejasmin is bigger than chaturbate though.
@_date: 2015-06-20 08:18:23
So this doesn't achieve anything and won't bring any new insights at all, but it will inconvenience some users for a while, and force others to include a higher fee in their transactions. What a great test! 
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:49:52
What are the implications of this?
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:36:03
How can blocks be missing?
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:47:26
Agreed. I've even stopped talking to friends and family about bitcoin, because I just can't be bothered anymore. Complete fucking joke by now.
@_date: 2015-06-13 05:26:44
You mean they are using blockchain technology?
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:12:46
Someone doesn't like the price going up...
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:47:42
Oh. Yeah you're right. I must have missed that one. But 3 weeks isn't very old news. Or maybe for bitcoin it is...
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:43:04
It's a very common troll strategy in here lately.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:22:56
She's also not saying that it won't!
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:01:51
What is this 2008 or something? Just keep it in bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:07:51
Thanks Obama!
@_date: 2015-05-04 06:31:47
Hmm yeah, that's a good point. But depending on the extent of the hardfork, the pre-fork miners that didn't update might no longer be compatible enough for mining. After all, a hardfork could even change the hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:16:18
I'm ok with that, I still prefer paying with bitcoin online.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:58:43
Sell now, then rebuy at $80. Unless it doesn't go to $80, then rebuy at $400 again. Or you know, don't sell and see where we are at in a year or so.
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:53:24
The way I understand it, a hardfork is essentially the same as an altcoin that respects bitcoin's history (the blockchain) up to the point of its own inception.
@_date: 2015-05-04 06:37:15
Yes, in this one case. You could say that this altcoin doesn't just respect bitcoin's history, but also uses a similar enough hashing algorithm to be mined by existing bitcoin miners.

I'm now going to test out XT. Thanks for the hint, theymos! Or maybe that was the effect he intented by doing this? hmmm

I heard he is a really smart guy and all, but it doesn't show much in his tweets if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-07-03 08:36:48
I dare you to send me 1 btc and double spend it to one of your own addresses before it confirms. Shouldn't be a problem at all, right?
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:00:37
but it's off-topic..
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:15:20
Close it and try with both options. It probably didn't keep the datadir setting.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:12:13
It's downloading the blockchain again? Maybe you also need to keep the -datadir option on the startup command line. Just put them both separated by a space
"-datadir=d:\BitCoinData -rescan"
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:06:57
The same way you started it with -datadir, but add -rescan to the command line instead.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:52:46


can you explain why that would make it worse?
@_date: 2015-08-02 01:58:40
Leave it, you don't need that. You'll make more than that from your book sales easily.
And why are people downvoting my comment? It's the truth.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:52:50
How can selling some hundreds of thousands of fake bitcoins point to an opposite conclusion??
@_date: 2015-07-31 10:16:00
I read that in his voice.
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:27:27
ayy lmao
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:42:35
Shut up and take my bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:33:37
The value isnt defined by how much it costs to mine lol. It's the other way around.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:04:08
You could try starting it with the -rescan option.
This won't download the blockchain again, it will only check your addresses for their correct balance.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:54:30
It doesn't say that in OPs translation. Where did you get that info from?
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:35:35
now replace gold with bitcoin, right? That's what we're supposed to do here?
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:42:04
lol I was checking out younow once and omg did it make me question humanity!! most broadcasters there are soooo fuckingggg stupiddd.. like how can anyone watch that crap? 
But yeah, would still be nice if they add bitcoin support.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:05:09
By offering one more browser choice mozilla causes the number of people who broswe the web to drop by 0.07%
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:38:31
No offense but you look... big boned.
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:36:11
but it should still show up as unconfirmed in the balance overview..
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:45:54
The web site looks beautiful! But one piece of info I couldn't find mentioned anywhere:
What are you using to quote the spot price and how much are the fees when buying? 
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:28:49
But I don't wanna meet up with  some smelly nerd if I'm in it for the pretty girls.
@_date: 2015-07-31 05:10:58
He *could have* done many things.
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:33:39
Probably not the pretty girls.
@_date: 2015-04-16 07:57:52


I too try to hold in my own farts sometimes.
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:01:21
That's why coinmarketcap also lists daily volume. But you're right, almost all altcoins have such small trading volume that their marketcap is completely meaningless.
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:36:14
That blockchain, so hot right now!
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:41:27
short squeeze!!!! and then the price keeps dropping as always.
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:46:49
The idea is that bitcoin becomes more stable over time, but it sure don't look like it.
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:42:23
A woman using a computer? that's preposterous!
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:35:36
Can't wait to hear about her reaction when she finds out that her 10 Euros are now only worth 8 Euros.. now only 7... 6.... 5...
What a great thing this Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:59:13
Most also don't have a need for that level of losing buying power every day.
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:45:06
Is this another blockchain without bitcoin thing?
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:49:49
more likely down to $160 then small bull trap back to $200 where everyone start celebrating the end of losing money with bitcoin again, then down to $130. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 07:18:40
I wonder how his attitude changes once he sees the bitcoins on his address are suddenly only worth half as much. He'll probably tell all of his customers how great this bitcoin thing is!
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:35:14
How much are the spammers paying in fees for this?
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:07:41
he had to decide to manually create a transaction instead of using a wallet, then make mistakes while doing that, then ignore the warning message. could totally happen to anyone who presses the wrong button... not!
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:53:31
big coin? I don't think so.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:28:01
maybe you should contact the site you sent it to?
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:42:40
that's a great idea!
@_date: 2015-09-26 08:30:34
$100? is that even enough to fill up my $100k car for the weekend?
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:52:35
lock is just another word for sell. but yeah, could be useful to some I guess.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:00:27


back in my day we called them blowstamps
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:21:28
awesome! and if someone is worried about volatility you can show them the coinapult lock feature on mycelium.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:29:51
is it true that some pools are ignoring the spam in favor of mining other transactions first?
@_date: 2015-09-01 06:41:37
But bitcoin is the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:11:15
"preparing"... hmmm
@_date: 2015-04-04 09:21:40
buttcoiners gonna buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:43:29
I wonder how many gold transactions happen per day.
@_date: 2015-03-22 08:52:33
Gotta support that donuthole addiction somehow, right?
@_date: 2015-03-29 10:55:02
Telegram is good, but [Conversations]( supports OTR and OpenPGP.
It's also open source: 
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:26:14
Concern troll.
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:17:37
It wasn't even a bitcoin business. Just another altcoin scam.
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:30:57
more fucking monero spam....

Yes, unfortunately it's Android only.

@_date: 2015-03-11 08:43:23
Yeah this thread is already overflowing with them. And they're probably also the ones upvoting it to the frontpage in the first place.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:31:38
Agreed. I'm just getting annoyed when I see postings that make it seem as if there's an actual limit in transactions per second or even that we're close to reaching such a limit and then the whole network would come to a halt or whatever. Of course the issue needs to be addressed, and the sooner the better, but there's no reason to act like it's an acute problem.
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:59:26
Only if the number of new transactions is over the blocksize limit constantly. At that point it becomes an issue, yes. But it's a non-issue if the number of transactions is over the block size limit once in a while.
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:41:27
But there's no reason to believe that a significant number of miners would fail to upgrade. The fact that it's a hard fork is really not that big of a deal when looked at objectively instead of using it as an excuse for fear mongering (OMG a hard fork, we're doomed!!!). And as I said above, there's still more than enough room for increased transaction volume, and it won't suddenly become an issue tomorrow or next week.
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:30:54
The block size limit isn't limiting the number of transactions, it's limiting the size of a block (duh!). If there are too many transactions, it will just take longer for some of them to get the first confirmation, that's all.
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:51:42
Again, there's still ample time for that discussion and for reaching a consensus. And just because we might hit the 1mb limit occasionally at some point still doesn't cause any merchants to "get burnt" or whatever doom and gloom scenario you're trying to imply here. We're still far away from that point. I dont want to call you a FUD spreader, but that's essentially what 80% of the block size discussion is anyway.
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:00:33
So you're saying we should also include all the buying and selling of bitcoins that happens on exchanges when looking at the transaction volume, and what happens on the blockchain is only a very small albeit growing part of it? Okay, thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:31:24
But that also means that the average number of transactions can double and we're still fine! So there is still quite a bit of room before the block size limit needs to be increased or a different solution needs to be implemented, such as invertible bloom filters or something similar.
