They call it tax avoidance and it's perfectly legal.

Move where?
Why do I have to move again? Why can't they sod off? They're the ones putting guns to our heads.

Better to die fighting than negotiate with terrorists.
Edit- I don't really believe this at all.

Well what do you think cops are?

Depends on the target. Fbi.gov for domestics. Cia.gov for foreigners. Of course you gotta be able to play to pay.
Or pay your way through lawschool and become a local judge, then you can use your local PD. But ffs, use proper opsec. Pay the media to paint the target as a degenerate of some kind, or better yet, have the hit squad tell a story of how they were afraid and the target was resisting.

That's straight up bananas.
Like if I got a traffic ticket for speeding and some corrupt cops claimed I was also trafficking pot so they charged me for thr ticket and trafficking. Then, after the cops got busted, they dropped the trafficking charge but retained that claim as evidence during sentencing after I'd fought and lost the speeding ticket.
So I end up going to jail for years because I never fought the charges that were dropped? That's some straight up bananas. EXACTLY the kind of justice I expect from involuntary government.
