You will get BCC for free, but no one can accurately tell what will happen to the values. That's how I understand it at least.

Thanks! I use Electrum so I can set custom fees.

That kinda clears it up, I didn't know that the fees would be as high. In my opinion that's very user unfriendly. Let's say that I'd want to buy $5 worth of BTC daily, it's possible that I would lose a significant amount of that just because I have a bunch of inputs.
I just read [this comment]( of yours, it was really helpful as well. Could you expand on your last point, about controling the denominations you receive?

Okay, that's something. Still, from what I got from another comment is that the fees won't really decrease, but at least it can be of some use. Thanks!

I'm not following, why do you have to earn $21.43 to spend $15?
Edit: Taxes?

Yeah, that's how it works... but isn't it a little stupid? 
Plus the whole cash thing doesn't make sense because in the world of cash, change is change. If you have $15 in change you have $15. I can pay using $10+$5 bills or use 15 $1 bills and it will come out as $15. In Bitcoin you have $15 minus all the fees that will be taken. So you actually have more moneyto spend if you have $10+$5, instead of 15 $1s.
