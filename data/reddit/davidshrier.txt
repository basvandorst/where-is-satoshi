Thank you.  I was worried, since a colleague of mine got called all sorts of imaginative names, that I would be left with weak insults.  "pretend-Sorcerers in spiral towers" is definitely upping the game.

Dave from MIT checking in.  Hijacking top comment since my note will probably be buried.  ChainAnchor isn't for bitcoin, Peter's post is fundamentally inaccurate.

We've tried engaging him.  He will show up, I'm sure, if he feels he has something to say. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:29:32
Thanks ChainAnchor is not designed for bitcoin.  We'll pick up the rest of your comment in the AMA next week, as you raise several important points. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 01:12:29
Hi Peter, you didn't respond to my email.  Thanks for showing up here.
"Unfortunately I haven’t been able to get anyone willing to go on the record and simply say who those Bitcoin community members are publicly; I don’t have transferable proof like phone recordings or videotapes of the alleged meetings. Given the potential consequences - e.g. breaking NDA’s with large companies like Intel - I can’t blame them for being reluctant to go public. But it does mean I won’t be “naming names” - I’m just not willing to accuse people of serious wrong-doing without iron-clad, fully public evidence."
I assumed by this, you meant you tried to reach us, the people you were writing about.  On second reading it sounds like you are making statements without talking to the people you are making them about.  
You're not a journalist, so you're not obligated to try for confirmation, etc.  I had assumed, incorrectly, that you were using minimum journalistic standards. 
We are remain happy to sit down with you and discuss your questions, as we said in email.  
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:27:31
Good news - mods are open to an AMA.  Let's coordinate around getting the word out.  I think we're aiming at the week after this.
@_date: 2016-04-25 00:13:30
Well, I am trying to figure out a nomenclature that is both inclusive and comprehensive - may be a tough circle to square and probably won't please everyone.  I do appreciate the genesis culture, if you will.  But the technology Satoshi inspired has expanded beyond the original use case.  Maybe this is the key insight - expanding the lens of analysis beyond just tech instantiation and looking at the cultural and economic context.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:17:13
So this is an interesting idea.  I was intrigued by Peter Thiel's experiments with offshore communities.  Have any of these gained traction?  I haven't followed the space closely.
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:03:18
Thanks for the chuckle.
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:02:01
Well, sort of.
Shouting "fire" in a crowded movie theatre may raise awareness about fire safety, but perhaps not in the most productive way.
Should we do an AMA?
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:17:41
The general answer is that putting a permission layer on top of bitcoin doesn't destroy bitcoin, but I want a more technically astute answer from Thomas on your question.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:40:29
Yes, it's disturbing that a core developer like Peter would abuse his public, visible position by making a bunch of misstatements and misrepresentations, and then refuse to correct his errors when they are revealed.
TL;DR it's not a "leak" when we publish it on an open website.
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:38:28
What might be interesting, for this sub, is to talk about AML and KYC more generally.  It seems a hot button.  See: 
Or, selfishly, I'm putting together a blockchain taxonomy for a white paper, and it would be good to get community feedback on thinking about private/public/permissioned/permissionless etc
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:07:30
Sorry to ask you guys to duplicate work but please feel free to spread the word
I was on vacation last week so it took a couple of days to organize.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:07:02
Not sure.  But we'll be back here Tuesday 5pm EST for the AM(a)A.  It looks like there are some good questions already posted in the announcement thread.
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:22:04
Hmmm...is there another term we could use in place of token / token less?
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:34:14
It's a hypothetical for illustrative purposes.  Bear in mind it's a draft paper, seeking comment.  Dialogue like this is helpful to address issues.  I'd be super cautious about context.  It's not "letting ourselves off the hook," it's a basic qualifier.  
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:35:29
We don't.  We are a nonprofit research institution.

I am sad I have only one upvote to give.
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:43:26
Yes.  Peter's blog, when I reviewed it, contained numerous errors or misstatements, starting with his claim that he tried to reach us for comment.  
I'm going back to preparing dinner before it burns.  We have offered to do an AM(A)A.  
@_date: 2016-04-25 00:14:30
We like token because of the crypto association.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:53:01
Well, I guess, but my point was that ChainAnchor doesn't actually compromise the underlying anonymity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:48:32
Except that this isn't being built for Bitcoin.
But to go a step further - I encourage you to post a question in the AMA thread and Thomas will pick this up on Tuesday.
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:50:22
&lt;g&gt; thanks.  On the other hand, many more people have looked at our paper than otherwise ( and hopefully we will get good feedback from experts.  We do, in fact, spend a great deal of time on personal identity protection, and it's important from our POV that frameworks we propose are rigorous and robust.
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:49:10
Yes, yes.  I explained elsewhere why my colleague was illustrating an idea he later discarded in a series of numerous drafts. By that I mean, people are familiar with Bitcoin.  Not that ChainAnchor was designed for trying to reinvent Bitcoin.  We (MIT) separately came up with suggestions two years ago around AML and KYC on Bitcoin, as separately linked.
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:08:11
Good question.  Will add to the AMA.
There does seem to be quite a bit of hype around blockchain; we ourselves have asked in various settings "why not just use a database".  
There's a broader AML/KYC conversation in your comment that we will pick up next week.
@_date: 2016-04-25 20:19:36
Well, there's a related set of trends in my opinion:
(1) a fundamental restructuring of the economy, driven by technology, that has moved people from careers to "gigs"...leading to a sense of mistrust in traditional institutions like employers - see
and 
(2) a breakdown of trust in government institutions (see: FOX News; Tea Party; Donald Trump; Bernie Sanders)
(3) network technologies such as bitcoin that disintermediate large portions of the incumbent financial system.
(4) A sense of identity forming around counterculture (e.g., Burning Man).
(5) "Scandal fatigue" among segments of the population who have grown up with Lewinskygate, WMD intel, Enron, Madoff, and the Mortgage Crisis, leading to a sense of unity around  driven in part by  and 
(6) willingness of people to use  against the backdrops of the other items.  The scale of community platforms like Reddit provide a sense of cohesion to a group that previously might have had trouble finding each other.
At least, that's a first cut at a bitcoin-in-context analysis.  
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:02:31
I suppose it's possible to build a completely unregulated society - Robert Heinlein wrote quite a bit about this idea.  Take a look at what the financial and consumer markets were like in the late 1800's and early 1900's.
TL;DR if it weren't for regulation, Coca Cola would still contain cocaine
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:41:13
If it were even possible to implement on Bitcoin.  Which we don't think it is.
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:38:58
Believe me we have no interest to be Teller.  Edward, not the magician.
As several have pointed out, it's (a) stupid to try to apply ChainAnchor to Bitcoin and (b) doesn't actually compromise the underlying anonymity of Bitcoin, even if you could figure out a way to implement it.
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:49:03
OK, well, that's where you and I differ.  Speaking in a personal capacity, I like the protections and benefits that being a member of a society allows for.  I don't always agree with everything that everyone does, which is where free expression is important.
@_date: 2016-04-26 22:45:44
It's not a matter of intention alone.  It doesn't, of itself, compromise bitcoin anonymity even if you could somehow hack it to work on bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:08:47
Now this is a really interesting question - definitely plan to take up in AMA.
@_date: 2016-04-25 08:37:48
Thanks so much.  has given a good roadmap, we'll post a question thread this week and appreciate your help in pointing people to it.
Both Thomas Hardjono, our CTO who wrote the ChainAnchor paper, and John Clippinger, our EIR who helped lead creation of the Windhover Principles, are available that week and willing to brave the fire.  We do need to sort out a date.
Any idea of best time of day?  4pm ET to hit both coasts plus Europe &amp; Africa? (Tough on Asia though)
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:14:38
Yes, we absolutely work on projects to secure personal data.  It [our research activity] is not a zero sum game.  We think that the money transfer businesses using bitcoin to allow free flow of funds in certain countries, for example, can liberate entrepreneurial action.
There are a number of unintended consequences of even the most "freeing" of technologies.  Here's an example: Twitter served as a major mediator of Arab Spring, providing a platform for community organization and leading to the overthrow of governments viewed by their citizens to be oppressive.  However, the subsequent anarchy in places like Libya and Egypt have made the region much less stable.  This isn't to suggest that perpetuating a dictator like Gaddafi is a good thing - only that these are incredibly complex problems and they need a variety of perspectives, actively working on them, to come up with solutions.  
I'd like my colleagues to have an opportunity to chime in here so will pick this up next week.
edit: misspelled Libyan dictator's name 
edit2: My top two concerns for bitcoin, FWIW, are concentration of mining power and scaling / navigating the fork.

Hi guys,
Dave here from MIT.
ChainAnchor isn't for bitcoin.  With all due respect to Peter, ChainAnchor is for permissioned blockchains like what R3 and others are working on.
It also wasn't a "leak", we posted this months ago on our public website.  He never asked us about it, etc.  First we heard from him was his blog post.  
We are in the middle of migrating sites but by Monday you can find it at trust.mit.edu (for now it is at   We would welcome your feedback, after you read the actual current documents, at chainanchor  
Sorry, guys, this one is off base.  MIT fully supports the bitcoin community.  ChainAnchor was never intended for bitcoin.
Edit: iPhone typo
@_date: 2016-04-24 17:51:28
People read headlines, reporters 2x so, I've had to spend a vacation week cleaning up flung dung, so to speak.  We plan to do an AMA in about a week - notwithstanding the echo chamber stuff, I'm hoping we get serious feedback on our work as a result of more attention focused on it.  
I feel a little dissed though - a colleague of mine was compared to Sauron, I feel sad that the worst they could come up with for me was "douchebag".  Whenever I hear that insult I think of the old SNL sketch, I can't even really rise to the challenge.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 21:50:48
K.  Followed up there.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:29:16
I'm curious, do you have a bank account?  Or a driver's license or passport?
Edit: I meant that seriously.  This tech (Blockchain) is interesting because people could develop their own federated identity in places where trust in central authority is weak.  We are already seeing bitcoin and other blockchain cryptocurrencies used for cross border transfer in countries where rule of law is weak.
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:50:27
Fully supports as in:
Invests in bitcoin research (which this is not).
Builds capabilities among Bitcoin programmers - who are free to do whatever they want.
Convenes different points of views to help foster a vibrant, dynamic Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:50:14
Peter's fabrications are pretty straightforward to pull apart.  He says that NDAs prevent people from talking publicly to verify his claims.  There are no NDAs on this.
Let's have him name names.
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:19:54
Who are these mysterious, murky figures?
We (MIT) work out in the open.  How about we name names?
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:44:02
Niemöller certainly had a way with words.  
We answer your question in our FAQ.  Question 6. 
 
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:51:28
I asked - issue is that since our paper is not actually about bitcoin, it's off topic for this sub.  Is there another sub that would make more sense?  Or should we use this as a "teachable moment" to talk about AML / KYC more broadly?  Ideas?
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:55:49
In the interests of fairness, let me add after popping up on Reddit, Peter did reply to my email.  But he stuck to his conspiracy theories, refused multiple offers to meet to discuss his concerns, and succeeded in annoying a number of people.  
It has been suggested that the reason he is going after us is our Ripple press release.  I don't know if this is true, but it would explain a great deal.  
Note that we don't have any NDA's with anyone, that I am aware of, with respect to ChainAnchor.  He hasn't responded to any of my questions about who these mysterious, shadowy figures are that he's referring to (his posts try to make it sound like all sorts of juicy stuff could come out from his "anonymous sources" were it not for NDAs).
He's just making stuff up, in other words.
C'mon, Peter.  Name names!
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:40:40
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:06:04
Thomas Hardjono.  Should I edit to make clear he's one of the authors?
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:24:30
I think that's an excellent point.  There are many use cases in peer-peer transactions (eg, the function PayPal serves) where either you need a trust network or a trusted intermediary.  Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies remove the need for the intermediary.
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:59:17
It was no more "leaked" than an original post on the front page of reddit or coindesk is a "leak".
Let's put down the pitchfork and pick up our thinking hats.  There have been enough wild statements made already.
Have you read our current thinking?  Or any drafts in the past couple of months?  
Start with  and let's have a real conversation.
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:54:05
No, that's not what I said.  
What I said was, people are asking us about a draft from several months ago, that never was intended to apply to bitcoin.  In the course of *seven* subsequent drafts, we have sought to clarify this. 
(1) have you read the current draft, which is currently up on our website?
(2) if so, would you like to discuss the current thinking?
As a separate note, I'm on vacation and am not an author on the document.  I'm just the most frequent redditor.  If people are genuinely interested in the technical topic and would like to have a discussion about what we actually wrote, instead of a bunch of made up stuff, we would be delighted to do an AM(A)A.  And before you ask, one Peter Todd-sized duck, not one thousand duck-sized Peter Todds.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:28:55
I understand your concern.  All 3 of the people you will be engaging with in the AMA have spent a number of years in the private sector before coming to MIT, and try to bridge to real world concerns.  
I'm sure there are people at MIT that are as you describe, but generally we attract a problem-solving / action oriented group.  It's because our mission statement is not only about education, but specifically about solving the world's biggest problems.  
We try to be sensitive about the ethics concerns.  For example, we are offering a big data/analytics class this summer, and have incorporated a substantial amount of ethics content into the curriculum - specifically to address our concern that just because you *can* do something with big data/analytics doesn't mean you *should* do something.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 16:43:18
Are you sure you are looking at the current version of the paper, or any draft in the last couple of months?  I think it only mentions Bitcoin in passing like 2-3 times at most.  
A quote from Thomas, our CTO: "If I didn’t refer to bitcoin [at all], the academic purists will complain �� "
Edit: typo quote not quite.  I'm supposed to be on vacation this week, trying to keep up via phone.
Edit2: I think you are looking at v02.  We are currently on v09 and counting.  
Edit3: worth mentioning, since the point keeps getting lost and no one has picked up on this: as I understand it, part of the point of ChainAnchor is that you can preserve anonymity while remaining compliant with the rules around money laundering and KYC.  You could have a third party nonprofit, for example, maintain identity verification.  One thing ChainAnchor allows is a zero knowledge proof that has the nonprofit say you, the individual, aren't a "bad guy", without you having to divulge your actual identity.  Note: not for bitcoin!  It doesn't really make sense for bitcoin for a host of reasons.
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:15:47
Messaged the mods!
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:06:07
Actually quite the opposite: let's try to understand this better, with a rigorous, systematic look, because there are several potential unintended consequences I could envision.  This then can help defend against those issues.   Maybe we should do some threat analytics.
@_date: 2016-04-21 18:56:22
Never said R3 was behind it, so let's not start more rumors.
Ethics is a core topic for us.  We'd be happy to have a calm discussion about the facts. 
Here is a turning issue: do you think societies, and governments, as an expression of societies, have the obligation to regulate issues like money laundering?  They currently do so, and to the extent that banks are starting to work on blockchain, wouldn't it make sense for neutral academics to take a look at how AML works on blockhain?
We have separately looked at the question of AML/KYC for bitcoin.  see: Windhover

I am going to speak for a moment as a private citizen and not in a formal capacity.  I live in a community, I pay taxes, I obey laws.  I have two choices: change a system when I find issues with it, or leave the community.  You may feel otherwise, but this is the life I've chosen.  I like living in a society or societies that permit this kind of vigorous debate.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:35:06
Well, if enough people opt out of conventional money and only use bitcoin, that would certainly have an impact.

@_date: 2016-04-27 23:11:51
I was illustrating the hazards of unintended consequences - there have been several other comments suggesting we're unaware of real world impact of research.  Some of my analogies work better than others.
Re: consolidation - I don't have a solution, hence my concern, but let's have Thomas and John pick up next week.
Edit: oops!  Missed your comment - ChainAnchor isn't forcing anything into bitcoin.  It's for permissioned chains.
@_date: 2016-04-27 03:00:52
So (as I understand it) think of a consented system for a (non Bitcoin) Blockchain instantiation where someone is willing to exchange the benefits of participating in the system for revealing an validated identity token - not precisely the same thing as revealing identity.  Thomas can explain better than I and we will pick this up on Tuesday.  
This is, to categorize it better, a scenario where someone is opting in to participating in a trusted colored-coin system - a very different behavior than someone who is using Bitcoin as a means of opting out of what are termed by some as "fiat currency".  The trust broker does not have to be either the counterparty nor the system maintainer.  The existence of this colored coin scheme no more invalidates bitcoin than any other.
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:38:05
Dave from MIT here.  Sorry guys, this one is way off base. ChainAnchor has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin.  Peter's post was fundamentally inaccurate.

I'm putting together a whitepaper about the tremendous potential of blockchain, and want to include a set of definitions that goes beyond "centralized, decentralized, distributed".  ArthurB has a decent take on this, but are there others that the community feels make a better segmentation?  How could this be improved upon?  
@_date: 2016-04-21 21:21:49
Yes, where is he?  We'd love to actually talk to him.  He never contacted us before posting and has been MIA since we started pointing out the errors in his post.
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:47:22

If you want to sling mud, well, it's your Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-04-22 14:35:13
As mentioned in another post, it referenced bitcoin for completeness and as a touchstone.  ChainAnchor is for permissioned blockchains.   The current draft, which you can find at  clarifies this.  If you download it and read it and feel it's still not clear, send us your concerns to ChainAnchor and we will look at it again.

@_date: 2016-05-04 08:48:47
Possibly.  How do you recommend fixing a government you don't like?
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:56:53
Thank you for the forum.  I'm not sure I swayed any opinions, but some of the comments were a serious effort to debate rather than simply ideological in nature, and I learned a few things about the dynamics of Bitcoin culture.  
@_date: 2016-05-06 11:52:57
"a widely-followed member of the bitcoin developer community"?   I've never met the guy, I'm just startled that with all the conspiracy theories flying around these threads, when there's an actual situation of a guy (Peter) pulling the wool over the community's eyes, the outrage is curiously muted and the critical thinking curiously, well, absent.  And that was before the Wright stuff dominated the headlines.  
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:01:08
No thanks.

*thomas* Advice: let people do research freely, look for weaknesses in systems and publish. Learn from ChainAnchor -- what is a better incentive mechanism to overcome ChainAnchor, etc etc.  What about mandating miners NOT to have anonymity and forcing them to disclose amassed CPU powers, et c etc.
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:16:01
Yup.  Couldn't understand why Peter Todd got so much excitement and so many up votes for a non Bitcoin technology, but there you go.  
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:58:53
Threat?  Not from me.  I do observe that regulators in a number of jurisdictions have already started putting boundaries out.

How many people use those?
The attitude of regulators, in my experience, is to focus when something gets big enough to matter.  Regulation lags technology.
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:45:57
1) the paper lays it out pretty well.  Do you have a more specific question about incentives?
2) recall this whole brouhaha originated from us being super transparent and posting WIP drafts.  I speculate code would be much closer to day 1 than milestone but on some of our projects we got to POC then published.  Let me ask Thomas.

I actually don't have a side in this fight, other than to say that bitcoin developers have helped pioneer novel technology (which I think is good), and bitcoin business people are trying to make that sustainable (which I think is good).  But I don't think regulators are intrinsically evil, which appears to put me in the minority here.

Had Peter not tried, to my understanding, to drum up business for his threat consulting by making fabricated and/or exaggerated statements, I wouldn't have done the AMA.  ChainAnchor is neither relevant for bitcoin nor interesting for the community (AFAIK).  It is relevant for corporate applications.  
Peter still hasn't identified the bitcoin developers we supposedly approached about working on this...because they don't exist.  Since there are no NDA's on it, if these people did exist, there would be nothing holding them back.  He has ignored my repeated questions on the subject.

*thomas* I'm not going to address moral questions - no one is forcing you to use ChainAnchor, bitcoin, cash, etc.
*david* I'm not sure how we leap from KYC/AML to bombing people in others countries.  But, as noted in our header, if the community doesn't figure out how to (a) address compliance with the law while (b) seeking to change the law, the regulators will probably come in and make life uncomfortable.  Point in fact most of the companies you are already doing business with in bitcoin have some form of compliance to avoid being shut down.  While I could argue (as I have in fact elsewhere) that AML/KYC doesn't work too well, it's what is going to be applied.  So let's figure out a smart way to deal with it before a bad solution is imposed on bitcoin.  NOTE, ChainAnchor isn't that solution, it's not for bitcoin.  But Windhover provides bitcoin-relevant guidelines. 
*john* Windhover creates accountability for the government as well - they can't access personal info without probable cause, a warrant, etc. - and they themselves are subject to oversight.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:51:59
Coming back for one more answer (wife will kill me).
1) go to   Funders are listed.  Same site we've been linking in the header to this AMA etc 
2) funding wasn't earmarked exclusively for AML/KYC.  It was for a basket of projects that included ChainAnchor.
3) no, it doesn't violate terms of our consortium to work on ChainAnchor.  Or, I suppose, NOT work on ChainAnchor.
Edit: clarified as I misread question.

*thomas* because you want anonymity.  Central database makes you reliant on one entity.  In ChainAnchor (again, for permissioned chains, not bitcoin), there is one Issuer, but multiple Verifiers, and they must not collude (by design).  ChainAnchor gives you true anonymity, with traceable transactions.

That's a pretty broad question but will do my best to answer.  There were no meetings of the kind you suggest that tried to get Bitcoin regulated via ChainAnchor.

@_date: 2016-05-04 18:36:09


It's not a leak if we publish it on our own website.


Not true, and not correct.  Peter Todd posted his blog SUBSEQUENT to several revisions that made clear this is a permissioned tech.


1) There were aggressive attacks including outright fabrications.  If I hadn't defended my colleagues, we would have been criticized for not responding.  Which I have been criticized for even in this thread, even when I responded, because people didn't like the answers I gave.  
At some point, one has to stop feeding the trolls, so this is my last AMA response.


2) It would be so much easier if I just capitulated to the fantasies that have been expressed in this thread.  I'm not going to change my answer even though I've been asked this question before, in this sub.  
The answer remains: this wasn't designed for Bitcoin, but in the interest of full academic rigor (mean: explore all ideas, including dumb ones), in the process of developing the paper, the team looked at Bitcoin.  For multiple reasons posted elsewhere, the team concluded that the initial view of permissioned chains as the desired path was validated.  That's not the same thing as designing a covert attack on bitcoin and then backing away from it.  
Exactly how would we benefit from trying to attack a currency that we and many of our colleagues provide support for?
So let's look at the two possible scenarios:
(a) someone who makes money consulting on threat analytics fabricates a threat, makes alot of press for himself around it, and stirs up the community.
(b) a group with no economic or other benefit would directly contradict its own past behaviors and current activities and policies just to try to "sneak" a covert attack on bitcoin.  Convoluted, no?
Setting aside whatever you may bring to this discussion previously, which of (a) or (b) seems more credible to you?  I suggest Occam's Razor as a starting point.
Edit: clarified, not a leak.

*thomas* Bitcoin already has a built-in incentive mechanism to seep up transactions.  If a user wants his or her transaction be processed faster, he or she just needs to add a higher "tip" in the transaction.

*david* So (as I understand it) think of a consented system for a (non Bitcoin) Blockchain instantiation where someone is willing to exchange the benefits of participating in the system for revealing an validated identity token - not precisely the same thing as revealing identity. 
This is, to categorize it better, a scenario where someone is opting in to participating in a trusted colored-coin system - a very different behavior than someone who is using Bitcoin as a means of opting out of what are termed by some as "fiat currency". The trust broker does not have to be either the counterparty nor the system maintainer. The existence of this colored coin scheme no more invalidates bitcoin than any other.

*thomas* Identity anonymity goes in both directions (double-edged sword). Assuming that the goal of a hypothetical attack to the bitcoin system is to subvert the blocks in the ledger (requiring 51% or more of miners), then it is very difficult to effectively limit the impact of such an attack in the current bitcoin architecture.
Going forward, we believe that a new "bitcoin 2.0 system" is needed which would consists of a protocol redesign ground-up so that it can scale significantly while at the same time maintaining decentralization. In this sense we agree on most points presented in the following position paper:
