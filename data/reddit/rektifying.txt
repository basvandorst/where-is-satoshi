Yeah no way am I going to use it... lol. I just don't get where it came from? No one has answered my question yet. When you install bitcoin core does it generate a "wallet" as in private key automatically or do I put my own in. When I put my own in, does it replace the existing? I am assuming only one private key can be loaded at once right?

Also, what bitcoin wallets let you "log in" with just the passphrase. Thanks

Yes it is still two years behind. It still has the .2 as of now. Does it create a private key when you install the wallet? Or do I have to load my own in? I'm confused.
On another note, my main question is this. If I load a private key in, will it remove the current? Like, can only one "key/wallet" be loaded at a time?

UPDATE: The bitcoin is now gone. There is 1 year 40 weeks left to load. The last transaction showing is from 7/28/2012.

I feel this is generally a good idea. There are thousands of people out there who can barely if at all pay for the medications they need or have trouble obtaining them for various reasons. This would give them more options and opportunities to obtain them. There are many problems I would see with this though. 
Trust: How would someone be able to trust the advice or medications they would receive? Would there be some type of verification for said "Doctors" which give advice? This would more than likely be needed. Pertaining to medications, the average person would be pretty skeptical about consuming a medication from an unknown source. I understand that each "seller" would have feedback and such but if someone sold someone a medication claiming it was something it was not it could really not end well. 
User caution and knowledge center would be a necessity. (For example: Google search color and markings on all prescriptions to verify what you are consuming prior to consumption)
Logistics: When you ship a medication via USPS, UPS, Fedex, and especially internationally which will roll through customs you risk it being "confiscated". There would always be risk of not receiving what you paid for. 
I have given this some thought. I feel that these ideas should be treated separately. What if end users could access consultation and pay for said consultation via bitcoin of course. Not limited to just doctors. There could be verified, reputable Doctors for medical advice, Psychologist for Psych advice, Attorneys for legal advice, etc etc. That would be pretty cool. I have seen sites similar (which do not accept bitcoin of course) where you only pay if you are satisfied with their "advice" or "answer". This may be an option as well. 
The above I would even consider using. There are times I would like some legitimate Medical or Legal advice but I am not going to go to the Doctor or go consult with an Attorney about it. I think you may be on to something here. I just feel these ideas should be separated. For example: Say this Doctor is like "Oh this is cool, I wouldn't mind making some extra bitcoin sitting on my couch while helping people." But then he is turned away because he does not want to be associated with a site that is illegally distributing medications. Just a thought.

You sir are awesome! Very kind of you.

Where do I find this wallet.dat file? I can't seem to find this Bitcoin directory. When I installed this did it automatically generate a new wallet for me?

Thank You! It worked. I now have $1.00 worth of bitcoin in my bitcoin wallet on Hive. It's crazy how easy it is to send/receive bitcoin. You officially gave me my first ever bitcoin! Thanks again.
