Thank you for saying this. I might regret it, but there will be no better feeling than not making that payment every month. 
No one knows the future, but I know the present. In this timeline, I’m able to wipe that out. As I said above, I’ll wait until Tuesday to decide.

That’s what I’m thinking. I can still buy, albeit at a much, much higher amount than I bought it for originally

Yep. I can afford to put in the amount that went into the student debt payment plus a few hundred each month.

Almost at $17k now.

You are the devil on my shoulder. :)
The flip side of that is if there is a massive hack that causes people to lose faith or a new crypto that people favor. 
I need a crystal ball to figure this out.

I hope to be dead in 50 years.

I’ll stay in and still buy a little bit every payday. I had tears in my eyes when I saw that number this morning.

Thanks for the encouragement to be level-headed. I’m going to wait until Tuesday to make a final decision. It seems that the spike happened leading up to the first futures trading. Maybe the second will shoot it up even higher. 
No one really knows what will happen with it. There are no accurate predictions, so it feels like the right thing to do.

By nature, I’m not a greedy person. Wealth is not something that I’ve ever had. I probably wouldn’t know what to do if I weren’t living paycheck to paycheck.
When Who Wants to be a Millionaire was on tv, I always thought I’d leave after the first couple rounds because it was more money than I had when I started. $14! Cash me out NOW!

This is wise. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:24:52
Exactly. Knowing what I bought in for and seeing this current number makes me want to faint.
