Nothing you've described there is racist, nothing. You use the word 'Racist' as just some lazy Ad hominem.
Sure they have some members with controversial views just as Labour have former BNP councillors and the Tories have sacked senior advisors who are racists - but nobody says that those parties are 'Racist'.
They're against the EU because it undermines nation state democracy which is a fact not even the most ardent EU-loving apparatchik would deny.
They're not against immigration, they're against open door immigration which is a perfectly sound, logical, party policy that has no foundation at all in 'Racism'.

..but what? I don't recall them ever saying 'I'm not racist but I hate all the jews'.

Firstly, he never said they would move here, he said they would have the opportunity to move here  - which is true, that's obvious.
Secondly, the youth unemployment rate is over 20% so increasing supply in the unskilled labour market while we continue to foot the bill for continued welfare payments is ridiculous.
Thirdly, all super-national bodies undermine nation state democracy. Even if every British MEP voted one way and every other MEP from across Europe voted the opposite way then it undermines nation state democracy. Again, academic. (this is to say nothing about the European Commision.
Lasty, and most importantly, nothing said here is racist and when you use that word to undermine a political opponent who you happen to disagree with it just devalues what real 'Racism' actually is.

Well...they aren't racist. Whats your point?
