What's your point? I've already forwarded all of the proceeds and cost basis to my accountant. That has nothing to do with mortgage approval.

I'm way confident enough in my finances that I could waive the mortgage contigency and get one in April when the money is all seasoned...it's just risky af
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:13:13
So I'm sorta freakin' out...
Sold $21k worth of bitcoin in mid December, $10k in early Jan, and $5k worth of eth in mid Jan, totalling $36k.
I'm in contract to buy a home in mid April, with a mortgage committment deadline of March 1. Applying for the loan next week and realized I'm probably quite fucked as none of the crypto proceeds are seasoned, and I'm not sure how to go about sourcing it when the line of questioning inevitably comes up. 
Does anyone have any experience with using crypto proceeds for loan approval?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:03:23
Thanks... that's pretty much my situation. It's just a matter of proving a paper trail of buying on coinbase, transferring offline, transferring to gemini &amp; selling.

I'm using an online lender that, TBH, has been a gem to work with so far. I suppose I could always go to a B&amp;M bank and have an in person conversation if need be.

Nope, sold enough to pay all taxes as well.

I spoke to her and she was like don't worry, I'm only going to ask for January statements and forward anyway.
Well shit, lady...I already uploaded Dec.!
With that said, her response leads me to believe they only have a 30 day seasoning policy which means I'll probably be fine as of mid feb.

i'm going through private lender
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:50:52
The only saving grace is that I negotiated the late closing (and paying the seller's prop taxes as of March) -- so worst case is I season the money and reapply in March at a diff lender

Everyone. On August 1, bitcoin split off from the blockchain and used the blockchain up to that point as the basis. Bitcoin and Bcash have the same coin histories up until that point.

You should probably sell, take the 10% loss, and kick yourself for being silly enough to put it all in if that's true.

The amount doesn't matter. How you calculated it matters. And you told knoshitajona he was wrong and corrected him...incorrectly.
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:14:25
Except I didn't lose money. I just won less bitcoin but the correct amount of fiat. I'm wagering in USD, bitcoin is just the medium. 
Until bitcoin can prove itself stable, it will always be considered more of a medium pegged to USD rather than an actual currency.
If I placed a $620 bet, I consider it a $620 bet, not a 1btc bet.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:14:41
you asked in a world without fiat...
if there was no fiat, you would only accept a loan if the terms were defined. you wouldn't accept 7 goats if you had to repay it in 4 weeks with 'whatever the lender decides appropriate at that time'
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:12:37
wrong. It's 15% of the capital gain, not the sale price. The capital gain on the $5 purchase was $4.92 as kinoshitajona said. The tax is $0.738, not $0.75.
your method would have you losing 15% on an asset whose value stays even.

Why wouldn't they be able to afford credit? Sure, that might make sense with other forms of credit where rates currently sit below 4-5%, but it doesn't hold up with credit cards-- cc rates would remain largely unchanged. There's not much room to go when you're already at 27%.

ebay ain't much better. I just tried to sell my old phone... first buyer accidentally hit BIN and refused to pay. eBay told I had to wait it out for the NPB dispute to close before relisting and wouldn't expedite the dispute despite the fact that the buyer in writing refused to purchase.
I then relisted and the second time auction went to end and the buyer never contacted me or paid. Same thing. I send a second chance that was ignored.
I then relisted a third (4th if you count second chance) time and the item went to NPB dispute after 2 days and i was finally paid.
Took me over 3 weeks to sell a phone and eBay didn't give a flying fuck.
