Crypto Currencies are the future or at least blockchain based products helping the world to be a better place. Users define the usage which depends on the convenience.
Faced a lot of problems with Western Union and Paypal for crossborder remittance and other transactions.

Hi, First of sir that's my own blog which I started recently to give to the world with latest news on Crypto and Bitcoin.
Yes I am new, apologies for that. 
About that Free-Kassa’s current collaboration with Petersburg Social Commercial Bank (PSCB) proves that there is a chance Saint Petersburg will adopt cryptocurrency payments as well.
Other than that the most important hotels in the city (and others not so known), have partnered with companies that specialize in payment processes and cryptocurrencies. The intention is to allow tourist to have a good payment experience if they pay using cryptocurrencies.
I hope that helps
