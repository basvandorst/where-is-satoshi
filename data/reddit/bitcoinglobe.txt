It's more related to tokens like DigiDaox(sp?) that back their token with gold. 
But I'm curious if you could back bitcoin with gold if you augmented a gold bar with a private key.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:10:59
already did noble sir

Not my shit. Staying at a military buddies house. I'm helping him move at the end of the month - everything is getting packed up. The silver chain is dope, has my ledger wallet on it, normally wear it on the inside of shirt.

'Spoken like a Gent of a certain age Cliff, it's a decentralised cryptocurrency without a host domain, China clamps down it moves elsewhere, further it's now becoming firmly recognised as "The smart peoples currency of choice" i.e. beyond Dumb Central Bankers. Overtime someone has tried to "Control" the price it just comes back stronger. It has been around awhile now, I personally bought in at $87 and am very happy with the investment, I can transfer large funds anywhere in the World virtually for free in a nanosecond , again showing the banking system for what it is... an OLD system run by OLD people for OLD people. The level of disruption being handed to the OLD World order thru' digital technologies is a long way down the road in some industries like music, television &amp; film , but only just starting in the "F.I.R.E" sector, I don't need a banking license if I have the Blockchain App on my phone, it's my very own bank.
Further, all this talk of getting rid of cash and bitcoin because of the amount of fraud ??? I'm sorry, did everyone not notice Deutsche Bank, Barclays, HSBC etc and their criminal behaviour rigging currencies, metals etc/ Not one penny of all their Billions of fraudulent behaviour was done in either cash or Bitcoin !!
The OLD World and it's out of touch OLD people are being handed their lunch by the YOUNG Bitcoin... time they all retired '

I'm a bit crazy for sure, everybody is. I'm not sure anyone can fit there entire life on youtube. Sometimes I win sometimes I lose. But I'm sticking with bitcoin till it either goes mainstream or becomes something else, no troll will stop me:) Thanks for taking the time to communicate with me.

Buddy, we're on the same page there...watch my videos on youtube, I say the same thing in a lot of them. My name is bitcoin globe. I'm 100 all in with bitcoin, minus a few ether, and a lil silver.
I don't think you understand where I'm coming from, watch my videos...
Let me rephrase the question....can you back gold with bitcoin?

My friend was trying to use GDAX(a Coinbase trading platform?). He typed in GDAX in google search. The first link he clicked, which was an ad for GDAX.com, what you see in the video is some sort of site that appears before he is taken to GDAX -url(westfoldtracker.com). We took this video after his account was hacked on 11/26/2017. Our guess is that it is some phishing site. He then arrived at GDAX.com where he input his Coinbase username, password, and 2FA. 
He wasn't able to login. It gave him a token error. He tried a few more times to login. No success. He went back to his Coinbase account shortly after, and found all his bitcoin had been withdrawn and $5000 buy from his bank account initiated. He received a e-mail from Coinbase, saying there was suspicious activity in his account, and asked him if he wanted to lock it, he said 'yes'. A few hours later, every e-mail he had from Coinbase was deleted. 
Today he has a conversation with a Coinbase tech(whom wasn't very experienced((please hire me coinbase)).
It appears the bitcoin that he thought was hacked from his account is still there; however, the fraudulent bitcoin buy of $5k from his bank account was still processing and the tech said there was nothing she could do to to stop it. She also said it would take 1-2 weeks to resolve this problem, and that they would resolve it through e-mail. 
Today he is purging all his devices....any thoughts, advice, tips?
I've been in the bitcoin space for awhile, and never seen such a bizarre hack thru his Google Authentication. 
Original thread: 
'My friend's coinbase account seems to be hacked, with Google Auth active. All his bitcoin has been withdrawn. Coinbase has locked his account, so he cannot log back in to give me his address. We were able to record a video of a url(westfoldtracker.com) popping up before his GDAX account. Is it possible this pop-up site took his username/password/2FA and quickly logged in to his coinbase? They also initiated a buy for $5000 bitcoins from his bank account. Tomorrow he will call coinbase when they open. Anyone heard of this before? I've been on r/bitcoin for awhile and seen many phishing site warnings but nothing like this! If somebody could rip your 2FA code that quickly...
All e-mails from coinbase were purged from his gmail account.'
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:34:26
not sure, 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:47:58
he's already has a lil bitcoin, and is moving passed the noob level- 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:24:14
however; keeping funds in bitcoin if properly secured, almost acts as 2FA for my bank account. For example: if I keep a USD and Btc balance in coinbase, and somebody hacks my account they will need my 2FA to move my bitcoin and if they withdrawal USD, then it will go into my bank account and I will notice.

Thank you for replying. I'm not quite certain how to accomplish this. I've been trying different things, I'm afraid that I may have overwritten my old passphrase, thus deleting the bitcoin in it-? 
'You can't set a third PIN code. If you ever set a new PIN code attached to a passphrase, it would erase the first one. To manage more than 1 hidden wallet you need to use the "temporary passphrase" option.
