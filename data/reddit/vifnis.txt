I have jumped through some of your comments / posts... even r/Buttcoin
I want you to sum up what you find so bad about this particular Crypto-currency.
Just sum it up, why it's fraudulent and how it compares to the US Dollar (which in honesty, is no more real than Bitcoin, i.e. [Fiat Money]( and I would almost argue that Bitcoin is more real due to its mining attribute.)
As well, what are your credentials, do you have a lengthy economic background? How old are you, 50?
I just want a reason besides a lengthy argument on how abstractions work, I want to know it will not work, solidly, not your mere speculations on the subject, I need the truth.

Someone who thought it over.  Now, can a tulip be insanly invisible yet be almost transmittable instantly through a network backboned by thousands of processers? 
The fiasco that was the Dutch Tulip Bubble is based through some wacky 17th Century aesthic appeal, and is a kin to making leaves fallen from trees every year worth millions. 
They are just not comparable.

I'm just argueing the first paragraph here.... A cat and an asteriod are entirely different things, although being made of the fundamental particles throughout the universe, I can consider them similar? Well, duh! But if I wanted a pet, an asteroid just could never do.
Tell me, am I wrong to state this.
Sure they are somehow similar, but they are literally non-comparable.
Bitcoin is, like the Tulip crisis, abstractly labelled to worth. But bitcoin cannot be held in the hand like gold or tulips. Plus, the function of Bitcoin is far different to traditional currency.
Possibly, I may be contradicting myself, or missing the point... but honestly, I am not informed enough to make a good point anyways.

Well, looks like its time to break out the Whiskey. In the honor of Hitch!.
