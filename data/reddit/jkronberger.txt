Could you elaborate a little bit?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:44:06
I get that but why are those always in blocks that get found in minute or less?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:33:41
That makes sense. Thank you.

Yes, that's why half of europe ditched they own currencies in favor of euro.

Last sentence destroys it.

I think he ment heating appliances are cheap, not power
@_date: 2019-03-02 13:31:41
It's a fair bet. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:35:49
Whatever the price is, it will always be a fair price. No one will pay a 100$ fee if it doesn't suit him in this form or another. Pure economy.

Like what?
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:20:50
I tried it too, 2 payments from different wallets and nothing happens.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:37:48
You're no fun :(
Just kidding, keep tinkering man.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:28:16
Heh, ok lets spice it up a bit, I'll try again but if it doesn't work, I get 10000 sats back. How confident are you? :)
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:20:19
Its ok think of it as a donation :)
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:33:35
Fees will replace reward in the future. Thats why we need small blocks and expensive fees.
@_date: 2019-06-09 11:56:33
No, he is sure it is.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:25:19
You forgot Nvidia. That one went parabolic lately.
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:33:22
Great work. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:49:56
Beautifully said.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:33:35
Interesting take. But is it same with open source technologies? Maybe users should have a vote.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:51:08
I disagree. If btc fails to another coin it means second coin could fail to third and so on. I dont belive anything other than btc can succeed in store of value category.

Under His Eye.

And also no way to artificially fuck it up in the first place.

I'm curious, how do you back up Breez? What happens if your phone breaks or you lose it?
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:03:26
Not a popular opinion but bcash has a theoretical value as being sort of a hedge if something goes wrong with segwit.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:43:48
I see. So, in your opinion, how does security of Breez compares to a " normal" lightning wallet.

Extremely bad article.

That's what you get for mining shitcoins.

This clown doesn't "get" anything, but the people writing his speeches are clearly worried.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:42:16
Your phone works only where there is cell coverage.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:14:32
I'm interested.
