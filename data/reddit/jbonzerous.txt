I do agree with you in some respects, but I don't think old people are the primary target. Online purchases and mobile payments I believe is, which is used by a much younger generation. It would be great however to get the babyboomer generation to be able to trust purchases online, and possibly bitcoin is that soloution. I know a lot of them do not like to tie an online service with their credit/debit cards.

When I saw Samsung is tying together with paypal via fingerprint scanner I immediatly thought of Bitcoin. I just see this as truly revoloutionary and wondered if anybody thought the same.

most currency has only 2 out of 3 such as
United States has 2nd and 3rd
China has 1st and 3rd
Greece has 1st and 2nd
does that mean bitcoin is ideal? also can you elaborate on how it has financial integration
