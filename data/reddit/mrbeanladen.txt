thanks, looks like I have to show them some personal info before I can get to buy or sell bitcoins. How long does it take until they check that info? They asked me to send them 2 photos, one of my ID card and one of an utility bill so I could prove I live where I live.

where did you find it? I couldn't find anything in task manager and i ticked the "show processes  from all users" box
also, how can I find out if one of the svchost.exe processes is infected or not? mbyte also tells me it found nothing, so could I have gotten infected or are AVs and Java patched against it by now?
did the website look like this one:  ?

did the website that infected your PC look like this one:  if you disable your java i think you can view it with no problem
also I made a screenshot:

maybe we can contact the guys who are hosting his websiteS (plural because I've seen at least another 2 websites that look exactly like this) and have them take legal action? when under a threat like this they're forced to release information on this guy, after all he's a pretty dangerous guy considering he landed on CNN or BBC news (there was an article about this phishing attempt on one of those websites, right?) unfortunately I couldn't figure away to do this
also, what were your PC's symptoms? I scanned my PC with 6 different AVs in windows, and used hiren's boot cd to scan my PC again using about 10 other antiviruses, left my PC open today and did scans all day, nothing was found also not a single BTC was stolen, although I have a very tiny amount of btc left now since I sold it a few weeks ago (a few mBTC left I think, last transaction was in April)
I really hate being in this situation, I have 1TB of valuable information, documents, photographs, passwords, books, 3000-4000 songs, 100 video games and a few other things, my password is secure anyways and I'll continue using the onscreen keyboard in the following months, maybe this will help...

but you can, you can store your bitcoin wallet in an encrypted area of your pc or on a PC that's not connected to the internet or on your phone (most smartphone OSes have no viruses that can do this)
when someone steals your wallet in real life it's the same thing, if you want to be paranoid you can tie your wallet to your pocket with a string, or put it in your shirt's pocket so you see the thief's hand when he attemps to steal it

is there any chance for an average virus to get past: mbytes, spybot search and destroy, eset version 5 fully updated database, rkill, also bypass taskmanager and probably inject itself in a svchost or something, do this without being detected? I also have a pretty good (new) router and eset's firewall, also did registry clean on ccleaner and  I scanned the website using one of those sites that scan a file or a web page using like 20-30 different AVs and It got only 1/30 warnings

your real wallet can be stolen too
damn, there you have it, real money is a joke too

yep, and I got so mad and desperate after that I did something very idiotic i wanted to see if the publisher's name on the java app was legit or not and I ran it again
I posted my question on stack exchange's IT area and people there thought I was paranoid but there's clearly something wrong with that website, it infected other PCs as well but I also noticed that when I run that java crap the image ("join chat") turned into a white square, I looked in the source page and i saw something that could explain this strange behavior (just a guess, I barely started learning C++ don't know anything about html yet) I saw a piece of code that hid a java applet in an image file and that file was the "join chat" image. I'll try to find that .jar you're talking about and scan it and then send it to those websites and also to kaspersky and eset.
But maybe I'm lucky and Java patched this already? considering it hit the BBC or CNN news (idk which site) a month ago maybe java actually did something about it and patched it? I have fully updated java, updated it last weekend because of minecraft.
