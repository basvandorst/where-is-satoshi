I think it would be interesting to get a consensus price forecast from so I'm compiling future estimates here: (survey takes 2-3 minutes): 
I'll publish the breakdown tomorrow.
I also surveyed 100 people from the general public to find their understanding of blockchain, BTC, and ETH. You can see the results from the public survey, here:

Over the past few days, we have been crowdsourcing price estimates from cryptoasset hedge fund managers, independent investors, and enthusiasts. We had 94 market voluntary respondents (all active investors.) Some key findings:
* Consensus was bullish for both BTC and ETH in the near and long term, with median price targets increasing over each consecutive period.
* Median 12-month price target for BTC = $35,000
* Median 12-month price target for ETH = $2,850
Price charts and additional findings can be found here:

I recently surveyed 100 people and got a 1, 3, and 12 month price forecast (spoiler: short term bullish, long term unknown). I'd like to get more sophisticated perspectives. You can participate and you'll get early access to the data.  Survey takes 2-3 minutes:

No one knows. That's kind of the point. I'm interested in what the wisdom of the crowds is. At the very least it will be interesting.

It's not necessarily a question of better/worse. It's just a different metric.
