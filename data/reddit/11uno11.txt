But, before buying or selling the crypto, you know the amount of outrageous fees you are going to pay before you set up the buy/sell order.

I think that the wisest movement that paypal can do in the crypto world is to set up a trusted scrow service for exchange of cryptocurrency. The seller deposits an amount of crypto currency in an address and they ensure that the buyer is the really owner of the funds to be transmitted to the seller. That's it. As simple as that.

Here you have an spanish article that explains how the ATM works:
Basically,  the withdrawal of bitcoins works like:
a) You have a Bbank account (it is possible to open an account with a spanish e-ID at the ATM)
b) The ATM simultaneosly tops up with euros the bbank account and then  exchange them for bitcoins.
c) It gives you back a nice voucher with a QR code.

I guess that it is a coinbase address that pays the transaction fee and the other output is also a coinbase address.

I also want to get up some day and suddenly remember that I have wallet with 200k BTC.

Actually the title is wrong. The Spanish government only stated that there would be a legal transaction limit of 2500€ (in BTC) "in case that" the BTC is considered finally as cash.

It is like an exchange, not a bank. I don't know how trustable they are, they are a quite new exchange.

You can also open an online account and verify it as usual.

Mtgox is more like Altavista, imo.

Protonmail users can send encrypted messages to common user. Basically, the web application sends a link to the contect and request a password. If the receiver doesn't have the password cannot access the content on the link. Obviously password is set arbitrarily by the sender and the sender must comunicate somehow to the receiver.
The sender can set the amount of time that the message is accesible. Once expired the message is no more accessible with the link and it is removed also removed from the "sent" folder on the sender's account,
