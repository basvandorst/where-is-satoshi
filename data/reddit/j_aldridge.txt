Put the bootstrap.dat in the data directory, which is the same place as the wallet.dat file. 
Also run from the command line with the option -dbcache=1000 for quicker synchronizing. 
Edit: make sure you only use this option while syncing for the first time though. Not suitable for regular use.

For everyday use it would have been much better to treat it as a foreign currency. That would mean no capital gains tax would owed on (personal) gains of less than $200. Would avoid having to record every small transaction you make in btc.
Even better would be allowing us to define what our own 'functional currency' is (and treating btc as a currency). This is currently available to 'Qualified Business Units' only. Opening this  up to individual taxpayers would help a lot. In the future when the btc price levels out a tax treatment like this will become more likely. Right now it's about the IRS getting its hands on your capital gains.

You unfortunately do have to pay capital gains on all purchases. It is quite a hassle really, think about the amount of paperwork you have to file for one coffee, it discourages people from using bitcoin for everyday transactions, which isnt good for adoption.

You sure can. You can deduct $3000 of capital losses per year.

You've got it right. Anywhere that holds your private keys can access your bitcoin.

And also when syncing for the first time change increase the db cache size using the -dbcache=&lt;n&gt; option. The default is is 25mb, setting it to around 1000mb will get you up to date a lot faster.

The $600 is the reporting requirement for payments made in the course of business. As far as I'm aware you must pay capital gains tax on even the smallest gain. I've never heard of any limit, otherwise you could split the realization of a gain into many smaller transactions and aovid paying anything.
edit: also even if there is no reporting requirement for a transaction you still owe the taxes on it. Reporting requirements are just about informaton you have to give the IRS throughout the year.

It's a shame they didn't go with foreign currency treatment. Then we would have an exemption of $200 on any gains and wouldn't have to pay taxes on every tiny personal transaction. That would have been nice.
