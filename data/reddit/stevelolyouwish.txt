25% off? Heh. Fools. This shit is already almost 50% off! 
Still gonna wait, though. Gonna buy more after this correction shakes the stragglers out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:20
Dude, sorry, but as a BTC hodler, this is pathetic. This is a cultish mentality. It's not healthy, and this way, you will never learn and you'll never be able to deal with investing reality.
It crashed because it had to. Because it went parabolic, and everyone and their grandmother bought it without knowing what they were getting into -- squeamish, amateurish types, get-rich-quick types, types not knowing that this is what BTC does as it goes through growing pains. It goes parabolic, then corrects, then the new bottom is much higher than the previous bottom.
Just acknowledge the reality that this crash has been in the works, and learn from it.

If you think this baby is done, you've got another thing coming, broheem. I've been waiting for weeks to buy more, and I'm still waiting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:12
Because I believe this train is going to keep going at least until the late 2020s.
Ride those waves and HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:29
So don't, then. Do what you want. I'm simply saying that the correction is not done correcting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:58:48
Yes.

Jesus christ... Ver is an *ultimate douche* and I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him -- but wtf is wrong with you? Cancer? Really?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:56:55
Smart man not having Facebook/Twitter. It's not worth it, dude. Deactivated my Fecebook account years ago, and while I have a Twitter, I've significantly reduced my time using it in the last couple weeks. Jumped on last night to see the bitcoin chaos, comment on a bit here and there, but that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:10
Touche -- being a social media ghost is ideal.... but sooooo hard to resist getting sucked into so many black holes of 'dicussions' and 'debates'.
For now, Reddit apparently remains to be my poison of choice, with a dash of Twitter.

Oh, I know, but the bubble needed to pop. It was parabolic. Charlie Lee's announcement was a factor, too. Roger Ver everywhere certainly didn't help, but even if he had stayed quiet, this would have happened anyways -- the biggest factor was that it went parabolic due to squeamish dumb money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:12
Buddy, I'm not selling my BTC and you just need to deal with it. 
This has been the trend for BTCs behavior, and I, for one, believe BTC is here to stay for a long while. You either believe in cryptocurrencies -- or you don't. Do research and make informed picks. I personally have invested a substantial amount, but am okay with the amount disappearing if it does. It would suck, but I can live with it. I would recommend that others only invest what they can deal with losing *completely*. 
I believe cryptocurrencies are world changing and am in this for the long haul, and these parabolic rises due to dumb money and subsequent corrections are par the course.
If you don't believe in cryptocurrencies and don't believe in the long haul -- then get out, because this shit is too hot for you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:46
Still too much hysteria, I don't trust it. The volume is insane, higher than it's ever been. Professional daytraders will take people for a ride in this volatility. 
Plus, Bitfinex is only at 13.5, $1000 less than GDAX, and Bitfinex is a billion more in volume.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:27:24
"Real parabolic" as opposed to "fake parabolic"? 
Which would this be... ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:02
In the long run, it's the blockchain technology, which is world-changing. In the short run, for BTC -- it's speculators speculating speculators speculating speculators speculating speculators.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:00:39
I agree -- hence why I'm not saying BTC *exclusively* -- I'm saying 'cryptocurrency' ;)
BTC is the main vehicle for now -- and Imma ride that fukkin rollercoaster for the time being (I'm in ETH as well, still thinking about whether to get some IOTA/BTS as well) and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:47
Ver's presence across all media certainly didn't help, but he was a relatively small factor in a large number of more powerful factors. This camel's back was breaking and to attribute it totally or even primarily on a 'coordinated attack' is ignorant and self-destructive, disallowing one to see the reality of the situation.
It may *feel good* to blame Ver, to focus your hate over what's happening (and will continue to happen) but this correction was predictable way before he started flooding mainstream media, et al.
What's sad is alllll the people getting taken for a nasty ride by professional daytraders, and also while being raked over the coal in buy/sell taker fees on coinbase. smdh
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:54
Agreed, absolutely. 
I mean, an 'attack' by who, exactly? Some AltCoin(s)? They've virtually all plummeted, even all the major ones, many at least as much to up to TWICE as much as BTC.
People feel 'under attack' over this, and I udnerstand why, but it's because professional traders saw the dumb money come in, helped everyone push it up, and they have pushed it way down, taking profits left and right, because unless you know what you're doing 'day trading', *you will get utterly raped by professionals on the way down*. Psychology works against you, and they know it. This is how it works -- not just in BTC -- but everywhere in the stock market as well.
*If you're going to buy* -- then fucking *HODL* (for *at least a year* to avoid potential short term cap gains). Have a plan when you feel comfortable entering and what you're comfortable losing if BTC goes bust. Don't try your bullshit amateurish 'daytrading' crap. 
And really, truly -- if you're an amateurish type -- don't get in unless you actually believe in cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:41:43
It is, and I'm not going to use a reddit forum to explain why. A quick google search will expose you to plenty of well-written articles on why it's world changing and why 'normal' (fiat) money and institutions are in need of a change.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:03:00
Oh, don't worry, I'm subscribed there as well and a few other crypto subreddits. This place can be toxic in a lot of different ways. It is quite the bubble (as it were). They all have varying degrees of this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:32
hahahah, I've actually done quiiiite well with BTC, thank you very much.
Sooooo... See ya!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:54
Yes, thinking that this bubble -- which is what it is (and still is) -- was due to a 'highly coordinated attack', as opposed to PREDICTABLE market behavior realities -- is pathetic.
Believe what you want, do what you want. Good luck with how that mentality will put money in your pocket.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:29:51


Of course -- but you're not listening. I *believe in* cryptocurrencies, and strongly believe BTC has a major role in that process. Given the economic rules surrounding BTC, I have my strategy. When I got in, I invested an amount of money that I was willing to lose. You can do whatever you like, but I don't find anything insightful about your long-term BTC FUD position. It takes no stake, no skin in the game, and such a position often involves exactly that.


@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:01
I don't agree with this as simply stated. We're not experiencing 'a dip' -- we're experiencing a major, but necessary, correction. If you 'buy the dip', you don't know the right time to buy. No one does, really, so we need another gauge, if we believe in BTC and crypto. 
When people everywhere start saying 'BTC is over' and the hysteria of buying and selling dies down, and the corrections shakes out the stragglers of 'dumb money' and volume levels out more -- THEN buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:56
Smart man.
Also... is it "big league" or "bigly"? I always thought it was "bigly".
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:24
You're making too much sense. This is too well reasoned and you're too reasonable.
GTFO apostate!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:18
Attack or not, the BTC price is dropping... significantly. We saw this coming. it looks like we've been at a top for a while, now -- so it only makes sense. It went parabolic, and so we're just reliving what we have multiple times before in BTCs history.
All of the get-rich-quick types are seeing this and cashing out before it drops too much. The masses were never HODLERS and we shouldn't have expected them to be. 
After the crash, before buying more, let the crash shake out some of the stragglers for a while as the price drops a bit more over time. 
Looks like we need to brace ourselves and HOOOOOODDDDLLLLLLL (and then buy more after the shakeout)!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:09
The whole point of cryptocurrencies is that it's the new wild west. There are no rules. Nor should they be. It's a free market, one of the few left, thanks to the internet, which has been mostly a free market as well.
Let it work. It will work. There are growing pains. but cryptos are going to win in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:31:47
Right. We've all got 'just our opinions'. The underpinnings of the BTC market, right now, are little more than speculators speculating speculators speculating speculators speculating speculators, anyhow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:17
Yup. For those of us who saw this coming, and knew NOT to buy the parabolic rise and the likely top, we're just chillin'.
Especially those of us who are still waiting to buy some more and think this is isn't over. :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:52
Yes! :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:54
It's not a flaw, it's a feature. Regular Joe Schmo from the barber shop just using Coinbase paying massive takers fees shouldn't be buying shit they don't understand while professional traders trade on GDAX paying nothing as makers and taking these sorry saps for a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:30:29
Glad to hear it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:37:53
Those closest to you often don't want you to be successful, or, at least, not more successful than they are. It would be a perceived subconscious reflection of their failure.
Moral of the story? Never listen to anyone with no skin in the game. People love to be negative when it costs them nothing and you everything.

@_date: 2017-12-24 14:39:47
Absolutely. I posted this in and it got down voted to hell. Tried to post it here and it got deleted. Tried to warn and educate people about what was likely happening and said to just wait for a bit to see what happens before buying more. I even responded to most comments criticizing me on it, to explain further. It wasn't 'unsubstantiated FUD'.
Turns out, signs point to an increased likelihood of me being right. Head and shoulders forming at past 1 month and past 24 hours signaling major reversal.

@_date: 2018-07-07 18:50:25
Hrmmm... notice that more people spend their BTC when the value hovers around the same point and especially is moreso willing to spend it when the value is dropping or expected to drop?
... funny, that.
