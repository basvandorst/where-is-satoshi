From my perspective, the main tipping point is usefulness for commerce, for which User Interfaces are critical, as well as transaction speed and reliability.
Modern finance moves in volumes and speeds that are hard to imagine for people outside of the global government or financial sectors, and we are developing Bitcoin wallets and apps for individuals within our small community instead of looking out at the global market.  
Myself, I am working at building a community that can create conditions for these things to happen.

I understand your concern with the risk, yet our 7 transactions per second limit with a 1mb block means BTC adoption by merchants will be limited, and BTC won't ever achieve general use.

Good, hard questions, though I believe that we need to promote diversity within transparency, each of us allowing for experimentation as we try to work together towards the goals we share.

Good post, and good questions.  My big concern is that we need to be careful when looking for consensus, since it can become similar to the "planning committee" process that soon focuses more on what the individual prefers and not on the goal.  Our goal is to handle more transactions per minute in a safe, reliable and transparent manner that does not compromise the benefits of Bitcoin and maintains the descentralized open ledger.   We also need to be careful with those who would create fake digital identities to give their own preferences more traction in the discussion (just as some Twitter accounts are created just to follow a specific political figure).   In the world of internet, we need a balance between public opinion and proven participants when speaking of "consensus".

Submitting ID will make the goverment and merchants happy, but will users accept this?

Thanks, Redpola.  I, too, hate the three letter acronyms, since I am a multi-industry professional and have run into lots of confusion over duplicate acronyms within city and state governments and industries.  And, in the Bitcoin industry, they become buzzwords that can cover up mistakes and even intentional confusion.  SPV is a very nasty acronym in that it covers up the fact that "Simplified Payment Verification"  is turning into a clear violation of Satoshi Nakamoto's "trustless" design, requiring the user to trust a specific and often unknown node instead of trusting the math, the code, and the P2P community.

The CryptoCannabis Conference is an excellent opportunity to show how two disruptive developments, one legal and the other technological, can come together to offer benefits to everyone in these industries.  The Cryptocurrency Standards Assoc. with be there, looking at how the two industries can leverage mutual success, and proposing some ideas for overcoming present needs.
