You are ignoring the shorts and all the selling ... you need a massive amount to equal them first and then further to reach 10k

Just wrong time to buy otherwise you would have enjoyed 70 to 80% profit .. the selection of coins is really good btw

Nop wrong .. both parties are dumping their btc to rent hash power ..we can see btc going below $5000 soon ... this madness needs to stop

The money in btc is distributed in its all holders while nike is a company that carries the cash in its yearly marketing budget .. who do you think will spend their btc on advertising? On other hand for same reasons ethereum just registered themselves as  a foundation like zec and ripple ..

Dont think so big .. current scenario is buy 5000-7000 btc and sell at 9000-10k.. if u want more profit buy alts with greater risks

This is as useless as the last 10 patterns which were showing bitcoin going to $15000 by now

Its called dead cat bounce .. huge amount of risky shorts with small stops get liquidated in a short time.. price comes back to where it started after liquidations

May be he needed those $800 more at that time than he needed $58millions now .. no one knows if he is living to see his future ..things should be handled according to present circumstances

What if u buy 10million worth of btc in otc for 5$ discount and price falls 12% before you dumped ? Its an expensive and stupid game .. secondly you normally dont get 5% discount on otc .. its 2% hardly
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:22:02
if you want fast money this is not for you ... its game of patience... we see dips twice or thrice an year and tops once or twice an year .. you have to wait for dip to buy and have to wait for top to sell if you cant wait... you will get rektt!
