He knows a great deal about crypto's but his general ideas and understanding of economics are deeply flawed.

Well I can talk openly about trying to take bitcoin at my Shell gas station here in Canada.  Bitpay was no help at all, I tried reaching out in so many ways even twitter but they had no time for us.
I would of started it but Coinbase does not operate in Canada.  They did not know about using a US account at Canadian bank or using US bank for Canadian business.
Our next option was Coinkite which offers us no protection or stability for the business.  CoinKite offers us nothing but overprices PoS expecting us to link with an exchange ourselves in converting to fiat.  We need fiat at point of transaction- Coinkite does not understand this.  Robocoin is a joke and like CaVirtex since I spoke with them have shown great moral hazard.  ( refering to wde sweaping statements like bitcoin banned in all of Canada since they were not operating as a proper business or attempting to lobby on senate for special legislation that would place them at the helm) - I won't deal with them on principle that they should not be involved in the bitcoin economy.
I also spoke with people at CaVirtex and Vault of Satoshi about just giving them free advertisements.  There's a TV in the store that displays ads, we have room for promotional materials like flyers or signage.  I approached both local exchanges in an attempt to aid customers who were interested and growing this btc community.  No one ever came back with anything.  
I'm right next to one of the biggest Universities in the student housing area, this is prime location yet no one will work with us.
My dad with his fruit stand on the side of the road is the only person in the Southern Ontario I've seen taking bitcoin outside of Chinatown in Toronto.

I like how people are able to just block out a lot of the charts data to confirm to their bias.
Take the first graph; we see our price has never dropped into the buy range since March 2013 when it had the initial run up.  This is well before the first big boom in April 13.  Taking from that forward the rest is just a rainbow behind a few lines. very pretty colors though and optimistic so the sheep will circlejerk and upvote... isn't sheep what bitcoiners used to call others? now look at you

This would be helpful too.  At the moment it appears the business would have to buy a tablet which they see as large investment .  
I am registered wit bitpay but there doesn't seem to be any app so you would have to just process through the web browser on mobile I guess.
For fruit stand where I use the Square card reader I will just take bitcoin from block chain and process it like gift card.  
Outside of a website I haven't found much use for bitpay.  If a store's PoS is running Window's they could print a QR code and the cashier could verify but this is not ideal as you want unique QR codes so the exact/correct amount is being received.

As of now this is the highest quality and biggest name accepting btc, so it's not Evil Empire or Brazzers but still the first type of network to take it.  This adds much more legitimacy than porn.com and is actually taking it unlike what Brazzers has hinted at.

The joy about bitcoin and this new economy is that you can just ignore the statist regime.
As far as things go though I don't believe in grey areas.  We are the blacks and they are the whites so I'm not going to prop up their system.  While I referenced LeFevre earlier I am in no way a pacifist and just as I get messages when btc tanks I'll message them back when fiat corruption starts to manifest itself in the public sphere.
To feel pity for these statist is really more than they would ever afford to us.  They wish and hope that bitcoin will go to $0 so we will lose all our money.  They hate us and everything we stand for being liberty and self-determination- all that is not obedience and servitude to the greater good.

@_date: 2014-11-14 09:51:53
I'll say as a merchant when someone wants to pay in bitcoin my reaction is the same as getting cash.  To me it is a  currency so why would I place it in that category of payment processors.
As far as like an American Express or Visa goes they can easily utilize bitcoin to become more competitive.  Since they don't need to resources managing paper wouldn't they adjust rates according to the market as the other competitors adapted.
Take the names out of it and still creditors have a role in the economy and will be a viable business.  Aside from processing fees, they still have massive revenue they bring in from credit card debts.
The argument I'm seeing here is that when Visa decides to get on board someone like Bitpay would already have them beat as a processor, but these do bitcoin to cash.  Where as I think the CEO meant when bitcoin is big enough Visa it can be integrated into their system. 
It seems people are expecting them to overextending taking in a lot more than they have now.  Sure they take payments around the world but not as a currency exchange.
So again, in the future if someone wants to pay with something, and they are able to spend the money, like now they would use cash (paper money or ~~debit~~ bitcoin.) 
I'm sorry but in this debt driven society people are not putting stuff on their Visa to go home and pay it off right away.

Vault of Satoshi is outstanding.  They've developed into a top tier exchange in a short amount of time laying great foundation for the future. 
I went in for a deposit one day and got the full tour.  The appearance is very business professional but still a laid back casual atmosphere.  Everyone there was enthusiastic about moving forward, I expect big things coming up. I'm sure it's only a matter of time now until they replace CaVirtEx as top Canadian exchange and are one of the major prices listed on @_date: 2014-11-29 16:44:38
Robocoin and CaVirtex are two companies I would not work with at all when it came to implementing bitcoin.  Early on they both would sensationalize news hurting bitcoin to protect their image when they couldn't get things right and kept trying to lobby the Canadian senate to basically set them as the top of bit licence here.  This was when the Canadian senate told the people in bitcoin that this was against Satoshi original vision.... yeah great representation guys.
I'm not sure what Robocoin's pitch is now but it has never been viable and always presented as a pyramid scam.  They said $100,000 for the Robocoin machine, they'll stock it-  that is so much money it's insane, you will NEVER EVER profit off that. I don't care where your business is.  If you got someone to take this 100k hardware they would give you $10,000- the fuck, why do you people still follow these crooks?  I'm yet to hear one thing good surrounding them.
The buzz robocoin gets just shows how disconnected bitcoiners are from the real world.  The same problems I had as a retailer one year ago have not changed.  Implementation has not much easier forcing any brick and mortar retail merchant to invest in extra hardware and training, plus if you talk to bitpay they don't know how to help with your business unless you are a restaurant where every waiter has their own smartphone... GROUND BREAKING IMPLEMENTATION!  This is why I must be the only person who spends bitcoin in this city.
I just gotta ask. Why would you spend $100k on a atm?  I've bought an atm. It was around $5k, we make $1.50 from transaction- that's viable. I can't imagine making back what Robocoin wanted.

What I take from this is that it would be ideal if they could bring it in as its own currency pair.  So by loading steam wallets with bitcoin you could keep it in btc and then be able to buy from market just how you can buy from any country right now and it is listed in your local currency.
Also with the method described above it is interesting to keep in mind you cannot withdraw Steambux, what would you do if btc price took off and you can only buy steam games

I toured Vault of Satoshi well before Gox had issues.  There was 6-8 people working there at their office full time.  Their volume at this time was around 10 btc.  Meanwhile Gox was the biggest exchange in the world by volume or BTCChina and there was only 2 or 3 people working there... Midas is coming soon though don't worry.

A glimpse back in history for you and the moral hazard they have been involved with.
Cash unable to withdraw April 2013.. keeps taking deposits
This time last year bitcoin withdraws stop, continues to take in money knowing there is issues, adding to the mess and roping in more unsuspecting victims.
Eventually someone flies from UK to Japan to personally ask Mark, where are my coins?  Ignored... media buzz begins.
Gox is exposed as being insolvent, continues operations taking in deposits on wait list while protesters line up outside. stays open for business with all this going on.
Without being able to take cash out, after the spikes, bitcoin continues back to 1k on gox, trading sometimes well over $200 more than other exchanges.
Once its realized coins are stuck there gox goes in complete freefall, everyone reacts with it. Gox onces $200 above the rest of the mark lies $200 under.
Trading continues, money of any kind cannot be moved in or out at this time.  It fails to function as a medium of exchange for this... trading continues for weeks like this taking in fees.  a site called goxbuilder was made where you could sell goxbtc for real money. value start .9 gox to 1 real coin, quickly drops to under .1 offers per 1 coin on the blockcain.
Gox says they will give report on a certain date. date comes.... still waiting, day is almost completely over in japan... like it's night time. no one is at the office where people are protesting, usually 8pm often later- 6am in US was when he would give these news reports people are waiting for.
The reports were complete bullshit throwing bitcoin under the bus- they claim to have found a fatal error.  Ignoring the bitcoin developers they had talked to put blame on and the bitcoin protocol for their issues... never took reponsibility but blamed it on transaction malleability.... which andreas and basically anyone familiar with the system responded with new errors don't have 3 year old wiki pages;  from there just continued to drag bitcoin down with the failing mt gox exchange hoping to make them synonymous to protect his companies imagine and as some have theorized a conspiracy to try and extort loans from people with a lot of bitcoin saying their stake in this project is at risk because they were sure to bring bitcoin down with them.... and mt gox was on the foundation... the people making legislation?
tl;dr accountability moral hazard 
we don't need the foundation

It is difficult to settle on a price for exchange, there is still a lot of friction in the market here in Canada so price for BTC has been seen has highest in the world here.  
As for not holding the coins, wanting exchange for fiat it is simply a business decision that is not mine to make.  They're not set up to hold coins and for standard operations they need steady flow and are not interested in mixing market speculation with retail business.

It is really inconvenient to have to take out credit card and put in private info around strangers.  Bitcoin could help but really $10 for an hour of wifi could never be worth it.  Also would suck if you were waiting half the flight for confirmation.

Walmart probably won't be around when stores list items in bitcoin prices
Walmart reminds me of Blockbuster when it started to cave in.  I see online retailers having a huge effect on their high mark up general merchandise revenue.
Just compared to competitors they haven't been able to match Target which recently entered the market in Canada or keep up with the growth of other retailers.
At an operational level they are failing to achieve the standards or keep up with the practices set out by the remarkable turn around in Mexico. On the supply side they are running with an outdated system with many glaring holes and redundancies that have never been addressed and sadly the majority of people in their system do not even begin to comprehend.
Walmarts failing to maintain standards as a retailer is just the beginning of their problems.  They have recognized that their biggest threat is Amazon.  In response to this they are trying to push walmart.com, the idea is to have customers order online and be able to pick it up at any store within a couple days.  
Shortly after this and the plan for corporate to buy up stocks Amazon announced Prime Air, said it was ready to go just waiting for FCC approval ($WMT still trading lower than when they said that after volatile year).  Regardless if Walmart has more warehouses than Amazon the fact is they can't achieve two day delivery, their supply chain is too poorly managed.  They half ass the system and often have to force product around.
There are countless other things I have seen wrong in the company.  It's all systemic so that is why I have no faith in them being able to change things and restore any former glory.  I honestly believe that they will slowly decay and eventually close up like Blockbuster.  They rely too heavily on their GM margin and are too poor on their food side to keep up with just that.  
Sam's Club will probably be fine though

That's been the bitcoin sentiment along, price will go up no matter what so buying whenever won't matter.
That is the same pitch Bill Still used last year when talking about Quark and cryptos.
You can't assume, no matter how often something has occurred that it will repeat again, that's complete fallacy.  There is little evidence supporting upswing in price here aside from the general sentiment moon will eventually be reached.
If you showed this to anyone other than the delusional bitcoiner they would not be convinced or be able to extract anything useful from this.

My dad has gone completely uninterested in technology but since showing him bitcoin he's bought one and has gotten a smartphone.  I day trade so once it made the news they realized that this is real money. This got them to listen about the white paper.  
Once the protocol was understood I talked about Karl Menger's theory of money.  For years I've been against inflation so they've heard the fact that in 100 years USD has lost 96% of buying power.  I talked about how when I became an independent I could get bread on sale for less than $2 and now its $3.  Meanwhile the National Bank of Canada is projecting their dollar to drop below 90 cents in the next two years and the government as a whole continues to back wild projects and continues broken  entitlement programs.
It is easy to make the case against the state.  We all know they are corrupt leeches that do nothing productive for society.  So you don't even need to think of USD or anything else falling just look at Cyprus and all these other countries around the world like Argentina that doesn't have economic freedom not even mentioning the counter-economy which is huge.
If we remember bitcoin as a protocol we realize it cannot be stopped, is global and the Theory of Money tells us exchange will continue.  You can think of bitcoiner in a recession, at some point they will have to spend their coins because we all have needs and wants and this gets the economy moving again.  
This is simply talking about the coinage.  Bitcoin is so much more, once you start learning about color coins, escrow and contracts you see bitcoin has the potential to remove a huge section of waste from the economy.  That there is no need for these third party arbiters who take huge fees and can steal your money at anytime.
Just look at Dogecoin, the reality is bitcoin is here.  We are the canary in the coal mine, *"just as the technology of printing alter and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions."* This is already out there.  The bomb has been dropped, and we can't go back.  Everything that the cypherpunks have prophesied has come true.  
The future will bring crypto anarchy, cyberstates and pirate utopias.  Pure agora is our goal, perfect markets are the utopia, bitcoin is the tool.

For accepting bitcoin in a retail store it doesn't give us much options. For PoS there is just a link to SoftTouch POS.  To take bitcoin we would have to add an android device which looks like going without a printer.
When it comes to mobile check out there is no Android app like Coinbase that locks down the device and makes transactions easy.  Instead when I go to my account on BitPay I am just given a QR code for scan to install which just redirects me to a webpage so really we're just using a web browser on mobile.
Also with Coinbase I had a chat box appear right away when I started to go through my merchant settings, with BitPay it is $300 before you get phone support.

This reminds me of the slow down around Christmas. A lot of weak hands were sitting in fiat waiting for a crash which never happened.
Once the spark went off late Christmas Day we climbing $100 and have never seen $700 since.  I think we are experiencing a lot of the same here.  
Many people are anticipating a down market which to me seems like Jan 31 is already priced in, only an idiot would wait until last possible moment to escape any scenario.
I think this realization that there will not be a drop will respond the same way with lots of people trying to enter the market quickly.  
Even when we were at $685-700 for a bit people kept saying the 'whales' are manipulating and there is mass inflation but in reality there was a lot of pushes to bring the price down.  The market was slow, low volume and less than $10 swings you can't trade off but we constantly found support never letting us drop significantly.

As in Steam integration is way too early for either system.  Aside from bitcoin Steam is slowly working on what they have.  
The recent expanding or local currencies was not as simple as to be expected leaving still a lot missing.  Publishers set the prices leaving people in many countries now without a way to purchase the content outside trading.
Steam is very much a consignment store, you can't just go into Mall of America and force all the vendors to take a new currency, the community has to grow first around it so it can be supported.
There's also the big what if that Steam doesn't allow you to withdraw.  Another take off in the price could create a problem with a lot of value being stuck in Steam forcing those to trade at unfavorable rates to get coin back out.
The viable solutions around Steam and bitcoin are already available in the community like through Gyft for loading wallet funds.  Using that idea the most viable form of integration I could see Steam doing is a partnership with bitpay that allows you to spend coins for USD wallet funds, but as far as the blockchain for your Steam wallet might be a little too much to handle right now.

I've never wanted to sell bitcoin but if people were paying in bitcoin through bitpay I thought I could give cashback the same way we do with credit card transactions.

The negative attitude towards mining needs to stop if the community expects any support.  
Miners are treated like the rich misers of our day.  Seen as only an evil entity looking to suck from everyone else.
The Ðoge community is so much more supportive on helping newbs out and encourages everyone to participate in the network by mining.  Hear people just say don't run BitcoinQT since it hurts the network and mining is a scam.
Didn't mining have the same grim out look last year.  People fail to see the potential gains from mining and compare it to just purchasing BTC right now which doesn't do anything to grow the community but just build on this speculative bubble.
With the encouragement of Ðoge I started Scrypt mining on my GTX560 early before my SHA gear gets here and I got to say this community has been wrong about mining and that is what is hurting us.  It's not that hard to start and is a great lesson on the system.  
At this point I would rather more gear for Scrypt mining Ðoge.  I've heard reports BTC is still undervalued compared to difficulty which I think people should take into consideration before telling someone not to mine.  The community has gotten sad and it has had its effect on everyone leaving us undervalued and attacking each other instead of encouraging growth like Ðoge, we could learn from them

Those are just vending machines except the one in Vancouver.  We tried to push BTC at the Shell gas station on Main Street West Hamilton but people around here aren't spending.
We sell more than normal convenience stores, have widest and cheapest tobacco selection, waterpipes and hookahs as well as the gas but no one was interested, even being right by Mac (university).

NA has it right with being clear cut with their rates in bitcoin with full support.  Of what is available out there they are the most honest with their branding.  With many of these sites you get stuck into the trap of alt sites you never knew where activated that are even more expensive then the main sub.  Also once you have subbed a lot of the networks continue to market to you pushing sigh up on mores sites instead of simply having an open network.  Another trap is the V.O.D. restrictions.
Notably NA also doesn't have a cam site program, something very profitable for operators.  A quickly growing part of the industry I can see live performance growing as a revenue source.  Right now most of what is paid doesn't go to the model.  With bitcoin we could revolutionize the way people interact online.  Just as SilkRoad allowed customers to directly communicate and exchange with their suppliers I'm sure there will be a network for an open cam community that allows performers to keep what all of what they earned.

No one proposes at all changetip simply in the community hub with public accounts which is a viable start but as it stands Steam has never allowed for you to have more than one currency and the way they have dealt with them has been complicated as even now a lot of games still don't have pricing in Canada, Mexico and other new markets.

I'm finding markets are more closed off than during the hype of $1,000 run.
In Canada here; Vault of Satoshi won't return my calls/messages, doesn't let me log in, meanwhile holding my coins claiming that come February they will have a legal right to steal them all.
I try to set up with new exchange, I will not deal with CaVirtex, they are very difficult to find common ideological grounds with, I've tried working with them before when I needed a payment processor to bad experience, and their lobbying on Senate with RoboCoin for special permissions (be heads of bitlicense in canada) has me wanting to stay far away from them.
Then comes the Quadriga CX team, they allude all over the web how easy they are to work with for money laundering.  They often insert themselves into discussions to ensure questionable characters that they will easily be able to deposit anonymous cash and withdraw from them the same way.
So I give Quadriga CX a try, send my permanent residence card in since drivers license is expired.  "Unfortunately, due to American law,  we cannot serve Americans at this
time, regardless of their place of residence." So I ask why so I can contact my immigration attorney and MP that work with my immigration and could help resolve it there.
Their simple response was basically we don't care to figure it out, fuck you we won't deal with Americans, renounce your citizenship then you can join our special club?

Everyone has a verifone machine.  Get something that works with that, where we can just click it like credit/debit on the PoS and the QR code can be displayed on the handheld device, NFC capable or print out thermal receipt.
Instead as a retailer we are told to figure it out on our own, or the only solution to buy a $1,000 coinkite device that just holds the coins expecting us to sell them ourselves, so there is no price security.   
I service 200 stores, I've pitched bitcoin- it doesn't fly.  It's a high risk venture, and very high cost to bring in and the reality is no one wants to use it, non are asking to, and no one in my area even has bitcoin so there is no potential clients.  With exchanges closing up with my money in it, and so few (really none) offering convenient services for Canada really 2015 isn't any better to enter into than 2014 which is a very bad sign.  I guess I'll continue to be the only person in one of the highest population, college town cities in Canada to spend bitcoin because if anything is going to get going here, you will have to do it yourself.

I can't get behind CoinKite since it is not a practical investment.  Last I looked they wanted $800+ for a PoS.  Their service also offered no payment processing, it simply allowed you to accept coins. 
Users were expected to deposit their coins to an exchange and sell them themselves. I think there was a way for the sending of coins to be automatic to exchange account but it really offered no security in local currency like coinbase or bitpay at point of sale.  So it did nothing to eliminate the risk of market volatility. 
They also had some model where they acted like a bank so customers could keep coins there but had to pay a storage fee.  Users could buy a coinkite debit card to use at CoinKite terminals.
Meanwhile banks give out cards, have cheaper rates to hold physical money and offer real services, and you can buy countless other PoS much cheaper. 
You could actually get a touch screen display, cash drawer, and printer as well and it would still be cheaper than what CoinKite offers.

For me Bitpay has done nothing.  I've tried reaching out to them countless times but I haven't found nearly as helpful as everyone leads on.
If you understand code and just need a simple implementation for your site then it seems to work fine.  I don't have those skills so as a retailer I've struggled with implementation.
On that front Bitpay has been no help at all.  The sentiment I've gathered is very elitist; they want some $300/month before you even have access to phone support and in general they feel they have supplied everything they need for you to get started.  
Working with Coinbase though has been opposite.  With their app integration is easy and a lot more secure.  You log into your account and are able to talk with live support immediately.  Presentation is clean and payments are fast and work easy enough to train new staff with. 
Bitpay still doesn't have an app we can use in retail locations, they just have you run a web checkout through the browser which is hard even for me to fumble with and cannot be left with a typical cashier.
My only problem with Coinbase was that they aren't available in Canada.

That's something already practical.  I asked Bitpay this questions when I was going to use them as a payment process.  We allow cash back at our stores anyway so it is nothing unique or new but my concern was being labeled an unlicensed money transmitter and regulation.
I figured that if people could use cashback and get funds in bitcoin we could ostensibly selling bitcoin.  The need for retailers now is something that easily integrates into the current system.  
Owners are reluctant to invest in expensive hardware, any bitcoin implementation is expensive, risky, and requires large volume to pay off and become economical.  Once there is an easy integration with verifone machine where we can get it locked down like card processing it will be very easy to bring in and train people.  On our end we need it to look like the security of credit cards so cashiers can process easily.

It is helpful because Paypal has a lot more exposure.  
It is useful for someone with trades online who will almost inevitably run into the processor/bank that wants to continue using bitcoin.  If I remember correctly you can convert currency with Paypal and at point of transaction so it is again, very useful, since most places have a paypal plugin, but even on inquiry won't take any bitcoin even on free donations.
Back to exposure and that other function of 'bank.'  Like Square, Paypal offers a quick, easy solution for retail so the merchant doesn't need to worry about the complicated back end processing, so again, this easily integrated is a real solution for a retail business.  BitPay offers little support and Coinbase as well requires an additional devices added to the counter.

Why.  It implies that they had conducted a study which gives evidence that people are using it more in daily transactions than as a store of wealth.
From my experience I can see how that would be true.  From my use alone, where I came in Nov. 2013, I went from only trading against other cryptos to losing interest in those markets. 
 Where as now, even after repeated $200 price drops I use it more and more as we go lower, starting out with Steam funds from steamloader.com around Christmas, to donating occasionally to FDR, and now where I keep some coin on my phone for Gyft for whenever I do need to buy something, or beeping money across when Rand Paul 2016 sends me an e-mail.

They act like you should bring your business to a foreign land cause everyone is walking around with bitcoin in their pocket ready to spend.
Reality is quite the opposite, I know when I pushed for bitcoin implementation we had no interest.  Even the people I would meet at my store to sell mining equipment to didn't have any interest in spending their bitcoin here and only wanted to give me cash for the hardware.

Post offices have drop boxes after which the process isn't any difference so there is little inconvenience faced unless you need to pick something up.
Banks are even more streamlined, at least most I've seen across United States.  You can deposit funds like a cheque through an ATM and have them accessible right away the same way as working with a teller.

As a merchant I don't see this as a big issue.  We are now more limited than before when refunding debit.  My system no longer allows me to refund back to card so returns are given in cash (like when pre-paid fuel in debit doesn't go to pre-paid amount, extra is refunded as cash/credit reverts automatically)
With that in mind from the merchant perspective I queue in the amount.  It is display on the card reader hand held, they can tap with their card (NFC with bitcoin?), or insert the card (scan qr code?) and go through payment info manually.  I really don't see how this is really unique to bitcoin, once that money has left your bank account we're pretty restricted with debit even with Interac services in Canada being pretty universal.

You can't "hack" math.  You would have to fundamentally change the laws of the universe for that.
As far as "hacking" I just explain those as situations where money was left in untrusted third party not liable which ran off with their goods.  Like you wouldn't keep your saving in an exchange- people seem to think those closures are like banks running off with their money.
If it is really such a big issue find a place that will accept bitcoin for payment.  I'm sure the threat of losing a customer to competition would quickly have her reconsidering and suddenly much more open and responsive.

All in all I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out one of the site operators stole the funds.

Quark begins with Bill Still.  Some dude with markets show on youtube, very low subscribers.  
After the bitcoin boom Bill Still took notice of cryptos.  His rationale behind adopting Quark is that cryptos are the future and that no matter what you grab you will see 1000% returns.  He then proceeds to go on saying that he went with Quark and praising it for the security and solving imaginary issues from bitcoin... which QRK still doesn't even do.  Bill Still doesn't know anything about cryptos and in all his interviews he's just rambling.  
That's a little back story you need to understand where Keiser comes in.  Max Keiser then retweeted Bill Still and was hyping QRK beginning of December.  They kept stirring up buzz but not explaining anything for over 2 weeks  till Bill Still was supposed to be a guest on Keisers show.  
The interview is awful, Keiser is rosy in the cheeks just feeding Bill Still easy questions, it's a huge circlejerk, they disregard the huge pre-mine as being something good and positive since it removes volatility from bitcoin because they can manipulate the market to prices to keep them 'stable.'  They won't even defend their position. 
It was also found that Bill Still was given some $40k in Quark before going on to endorse it... and the backers see nothing wrong with that.  The Quark community is a bunch of nuts.  They are now the biggest crypto-cult after overtaking Megacoin.  Stay away from the kool-aid.
Fontas ‏ even tweeted:   Quark is premined so dont advertise it
It's important to know what happened before this which would make this pump and dump so successful.  Max Keiser made a prediction for $50 ltc (after I did), everyone thought he was a genius since LTC went from $9 to $30+ very quickly... which was very obvious and safe prediction.  So people were very confident in his predictions which is when he tricked his followers by endorsing Bill Still.  All he did after was hype Quark with the rest of the 'pump and dump' twitter accounts.  His crew of bloggers brought great support and plenty of people to unload their useless coin on.  Look around the forums and you will see that Quark people are a bunch of fucking insane totalitarian freaks.  See what happens if you challenge them or make any suggestions or question the project- they'll come after you with torches and pitchforks

So if I have to deliver or it's your first bitcoin purchase and I'm going to have to do the whole introduction and set up a wallet for them it becomes expensive, and when you are only paying $100 your not going to get much back.

Sure OP is a jerk, but if cryptos are money in reality money is not really a sincere gift.  The exception I could see if you know they're interested in it, then it's like a rare coin or foreign treasure

I think you've identified the difference there.  With a physical gift there is the instant gratitude of getting something new.  
With that you can tell the person took the time to pick something, which is why I brought up sincere not discredit other gifts.
My grandfather usually gives $100 to the kids for Christmas which gets put into savings.  Last year they got neck pillows from the duty free and some other small stuff, everything no more than $25 but they loved it and wore them all night.  So it's all relative, gifts come from the heart and are personal, you can't measure or judge it.

People are still listening to him after Quark?  This guy is just as corrupt as the people he attacks.  He always has to try and rip into his opponents and be adversarial so he never has to play defense. 
He'll never defend his wild positions, that QRK interview with Bill Still had to be the biggest circlejerk I've seen. They're both huge market manipulators.  Bill Still was given some 400,000 QRK to endorse it and Keiser sees no similarities between his shady dealing and the banksters he emulates.  Max Keiser is a hypocrite who's never been challenged on his positions

Do all Subways take bitcoin now?  This is really spreading quick.  
I was in one last week and was going to ask if they accepted bitcoins as a joke because I haven't seen anything bitcoin around me.
Also since we're sharing bad debit card experiences last week I was selling Xbox One on Kijiji.  The buyer said he only had one debit card he said he found/pulled out of his car.  Then got his girlfriend to transfer him $600.  When he goes his money from the ATM it has $400 limit (plus account gets put on hold.)  We go to the bank, this is where we realize its locked.  He calls number on card, after almost 45 minutes on phone finally able to withdraw the cash... he was also an hour late showing up and it took me 45 minutes to buy the stupid Xbox One because Walmart is awful... ended up putting in time for that little hustle.

Thanks that looks cool.  I might get one of those for mobile processing for my dad.  He has a roadside produce stand and I wanted to get him set up with his own credit card swipe last year because the store we were outside was so unreliable- when new management came in they didn't have phone so not even interac, so we lose sales to people who don't have cash

It seems like the owner knew the customers.  They simply scanned the public key but confirmation was never shown.   This still requires another piece of hardware to be added to the PoS.
I am trying to set up bitcoin payments but haven't been able to find a hand held terminal solution.  Would it be difficult to connect an android tablet or display for unique QR codes to set the bitcoin requested amount.  I think then sales could be processed as cash on the PoS if we had a merchant solution like Bitpay for Canda since I don't think they're ready to buy bitcoins

I recently spent a lot of time in Walmart and I do not share the same optimism.  I could go into detail making a case against it but I'll just give a few examples.  
Western Union is not maintained, locations sometimes go over a month without the service.  As whole Walmart is failing to achieve the profile and vision set out from Mexico which took the lead a couple years ago with their planning and renovations.  They haven't been able to keep up with their supply chain, so right now have very poor inventory control.  I am just trying to demonstrate how resistant the whole company is to change which was very obvious the way they have to go about new projects.
You also overlook **Walmart Financial Services** which is becoming a huge part of their business.  They have been pushing their Walmart MasterCard hard this year with many promo weekends and even an incentive program for cashiers.  
Walmart reminds me of Blockbuster when it began to collapse in on itself.  I think they realize that in the future it is going to be hard for them to compete in the department store space, this is why they have been pushing grocery even in the smallest stores.  The biggest threat is Amazon, and I doubt they'll be able to keep up.
Last report they focused on how they were going to compete with Target coming to Canada and Amazon, none of these threats have been addressed.  Walmart stock is wildly volatile compared to competitors, since numbers were down earlier this year Corporate announced they would be pumping the stock.  Walmart is now incredibly short sighted, the main focus has been cutting back and maximizing profits so that the shareholder can get more.  This has left them short all around often unable to properly serve the customer or even mange inventory.
With the advent of something like Amazon Prime Air I can't see Walmart staying competitive.  Their mindset was we have Walmart stores all over, customers can order stuff cheapest from Walmart.com and pick it up at a store within 2 days.  They can't get delivery done in 2 weeks and are no longer have that price advantage.  Target has been stable the past year and has really expanded their grocery area.  They have a much better system than Walmart that people don't understand.  Walmart wastes so much money on what has been described as rubes to just fill the space so there are enough Walmart apologist to calm the customer.  Target is mainly an overnight operation, leaving the stocking till when it is easiest, only focusing on critical and outs throughout the day.
/rant 
The main takeaway is **Walmart Financial Services**.  **Walmart Financial Services** is how Walmart will always stick around.  Back to the Blockbuster analogy.  I think they are becoming self aware or at least have seen the writing on the walls, so while **Walmart Financial Services** is huge economic game it is also huge moral hazard for when this too big to fail goes under and lobbies on congress.  Walmart is not going to allow a competing payment system after all the effort they've put into this project.

You want to know what other exchanges are doing so you have an idea of where you are heading.  For example there was recently a 1100BTC wall on gox that once gone sent the price up very quickly.  Or as we just saw the failure to break $750 has us dancing again instead of continued fall.
Thesell walls are very important when dealing with alt coins and being conscious of market manipulation pushing down major exchanges and how it effects you.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:48:12
I've only been selling online so far but I don't require any confirmations just to see it in my bitcoinQT wallet which is always instant.
To me bitcoin is less risk than credit cards which are expensive to use.  At the gas station we have a lot of problems with foreign cards even those from USA being used in Canada.  
By running not even a full node at the business I don't see this as a problem, and really it is a lot lower risk than the current payment processors so I don't think it is really necessary to wait for a confirmation.

I've had a couple customers from Israel but I didn't get any perspective from them.  I think my cousins there would like it.  There are many divided families across the globe now that bitcoin helps connect.  I know they are not happy with the shekel. Max Keiser has also advised Palestinian Monetary Authority to embrace BTC.
Talking more in depth with user from Turkey he said there is not much value being placed the Turkish currency so bitcoin should provide a nice escape although he didn't really agree with me talking about the potential. To me those are both huge markets that could be the entry point for wider adoption.  His attitude was bitcoin will be bitcoin and people will speculate but government will still control monopoly on cash

The widespread support across the globe has me start to think this could be a good replacement to traveler cheques.  Thinking about tourism I believe people will move onto buying bitcoin for trips.  This eliminates a lot of the confusion of dealing with foreign currencies as well as the risk of traveling with large amounts of cash.

It's actually really easy to set up.  Users communicate with the bot to secure transaction to their wallet so you can send it to other users on reddit.  
It's kind of like those steam trading card systems that you can deposit and withdraw from.  The cool thing is I can tip anyone on reddit even if they haven't set up an account and the bot holds their credits, so you're already involved!

I believe the fee issue is going to be resolved in .9.  
I don't think there is much resistance to changes it, they're just going to keep up with the adoption which now because of price makes sense to lower.
Still a the situation you are describing of 1 or 10 cent (optional) transactions is that it is still less than Paypal which expects 31 cents off a dollar.  For my small sales I'm practically engaging in charity.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:37:50
Easiest pitch.  
I've been selling a lot to people in the community.  No one around here takes bitcoin, now they're all looking for some place to send a little.  We need to take bitcoin, people want to give us their money.
EDIT:  You could always just set it up for yourself to use.  Even if I can't get a PoS to work I'll still be able to take my own bitcoins :D
