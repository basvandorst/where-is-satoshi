She's a .... smart cookie.
I'll see myself out now.

idk seems stuipid.
You get charged 4% for depositing CC =&gt; Coinbase.
Then he goes on to say that the fee for CC =&gt; GDAX is 0%.
but the way he says it; he completely brushes over the original 4%. 
He is totes trying to get referral cash and what he says in this video is dumb af.

You might see this as a positive thing but I only see this as a negative. I bought in at $50 and sold at $100. FML.

I'm not entirely sold on how SegWit will solve anything when you have miners mining empty blocks. The real problem is the network accepting empty blocks when the Transaction Pool is huge.

$2k - $3k per drive if the quotes i got in 2015 are still accurate.

Minimally, 2 safety deposit boxes.
1 with your paper wallet.
the other with the private key.
A lawyer or otherwise trusted person to know the location of both things but cannot actually access them.
The 2 deposit boxes should be geographically far.
As your paranoia level increases increase the number of safety deposit boxes from 1 =&gt; N.
ofc doing anything with your wallet other than depositing is a huge PITA... but since you are HODLING it doesn't matter.
How'd I do sempai?

The problem is that the bitcoin protocol accepts 0 size blocks when there is a huge mem-pool.

The classy message break-up, can't even do it to his face.

I don't see the point in S2X if a majority of the pools say fuck you and are mining blocks with 0 transactions in them anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:30:11
bhahahahhaa this is amazing.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:58:06

@_date: 2017-07-14 01:52:39

@_date: 2017-07-27 02:11:34
0x so ETH ?
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:45:07
coffee would be cold by the time the transaction went through.

So PHP.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:47:25
no sue them, in Canada the losing party pays legal fees for both sides. Fuck'em.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:45:48
this deserves some gold.

Have you had a chance to look at those new Tesla battery packs for houses? Not sure if they are in full production cycle or not, but perhaps it might be a better solution than a power system + lead batteries.

Why do you think bitmain has like 90 day waitlists for shipping... when you buy a miner they "QA" it for 90 days then ship it to you.
For those who don't know the most profitable time for a miner is literally the moment when it is first assembled. So bitmain double dips. 
They keep it during the most profitable time for the miner and the catch is that you paid for it. Paid twice :) By the time they get around sending it to you they have definitely made a sizable chunk of the actual material cost back.
yada yada blah blah about development fees and what not. until they ship it after I order it I will never buy an ASIC miner.

just like how I went to the bank to pay my property taxes and dumbshit blond teller decides to use that money to pay my hydro-bill instead. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:02:06
Oh mannnnn
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:29:28
well you better tell him to get his ass in gear for when it dips below 1800.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:56:25
I dont even understand how this works. A transaction ledger does not operate in this way at all. what the fuck
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:26:14
but when you exchange your BTC to USD or whatever currency ... you gotta put that currency somewhere :P like a bank.

ok this is just getting crazy. it's like singal inception ffs.

@_date: 2017-06-28 01:42:05
It likely wont take them 5 minutes to fix it. You just can't edit a sql table and say insert 200,000usd. sorry bud.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:46:13
ok. mr pro dev, where's your github profile?
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:06:40
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:33:48
I hope this doesnt come into affect by July 1st. It would be such a shame that I couldn't attend a reunion for this stupid reason.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:34:39
what's the end-game though?
sure he gets all blocks for 3 days in theory, but do you think BTC will still be anywhere near 2700/usd/block ?
it's an everyone loses situation.
