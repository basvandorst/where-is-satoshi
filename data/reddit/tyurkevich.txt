sad part is, he would have been fine if he played Nvidia or MU. It's just AMD that sucks fucking cock. Red ytd. I am bagholding AMD and I fucking hate everything about the company now.

If you don't want to play the lottery, that's fine, don't discourage other people from it. I'm saying it's unlikely that you will actually win a real bitcoin, but it's not impossible, and it's not impossible for you to get a small return on your investment here. That's true. What you're saying is that it is impossible. Gox bitcoins still have value for a reason, man.

Same person? Same tone. Trying to manipulate the market. You're doing a poor job.

Fuck Buttercoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:09:44
typical tullipfutures, talking shit like you know what's going to happen. I think everybody is tired of reading your posts. shut the fuck up.

"I am currently investigating legal avenues to attempt to claim some portion of the assets Bitcoin Builder (and therefore its users) have with Mt. Gox. I expect the chance this will be at all successful is slim." 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:18:20
Can you please never post on Reddit again? Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:29:03
I'm just a guy who kept telling himself the largest bitcoin exchange in the world can't possibly freeze my account and make away with my money. I kept telling myself krapeles is socially inept and somebody else would pick up where he left off... I'm still telling myself this. I've been up all night refreshing new reddit posts... I can't get out of bed. I cancelled my psu order on amazon. I still feel like there is a small chance...
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:45
nice... only if everybody else tried to do their own research rather than relying on the manipulative reddit posts. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:22:15
i hope it stays that way... 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:38:08
Stop spreading FUD. You don't know shit. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:56:07
reading that gave me a headache... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:13:05
I didn't sign the agreement when I signed up, that agreement was created days later, after I already invested money into bitcoin builder, so it won't hold up in court. The agreement doesn't mention anything of allowing Josh to perform transactions under my name, does it? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:56:51
and you're here to manipulate the market by spreading fear. fuck off. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:27:50
I haven't considered that, you're right that all the transactions are under his name and that does complicate things.. I don't know. I just want my 5 gox coins back. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:52:37
this is an IRC chat, so it must be legit. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:16:11
Imagine what I'm going through now. It's like Karpeles and Josh are double pumping me. and everybody said something like this would never happen again.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:44:28
Where do you get your facts? Because right now, nobody knows what is going on or what will happen. So unless you have inside knowledge that the rest of us don't have, you need to shut the fuck up. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:30:52
i hope this can all be fixed...like i really need something else keeping me awake at night. fuck. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:44:34
So he couldn't comment on it for what ever reason. Yeah that's shady, it looks terrible... Gox hasn't told us what they are doing, but they have told us that our funds are safe, have they not? Several users have emails confirming that employees of mtgox said this. I would trust that more than the word of a random guy on Reddit posting a leaked document that made no sense.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:10:09
tl;dr 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:06:39
They can't get out of it, the funds are on bitcoinbuilder's wallet, right? He can transfer them directly to any bitcoin wallet.

All of these gox bitcoins are in his account. If he hires an attorney and gets his coins back, we will get our coins back as well. Very unlikely, not impossible. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:56:04
stay hopeful because you will probably get your coins back in a few weeks... 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:13:00
It's kind of tl;dr for me, so correct me
If I'm wrong..
So some random guy received this unofficial draft document supposedly leaked by gox, along with other files supposedly leaked from gox, and we should believe him? 
How many people on here are posting about their 5200 bitcoin loses, with absolutely ZERO hopes of getting any of that back? TOO MANY. It's incredibly suspicious. Most of these posts can't be real and the ones that are real must be written by depressed and shocked individuals who actually believe they won't get their coins back because that's what these market manipulators keep telling them. 
Most people lurk reddit rather than posting anything, these market manipulators are counting on it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:03:07
What I understand is that things look terrible, but nobody knows for sure what will happen. Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:01:08
I hope you're right. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:32:25
Wait it out....you may still get your coins back
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:17:17
that's not entirely true. you can buy one gox coin at .05, and sell it at .10 (if its value goes that high again) and you'll nearly double the bitcoins you had to begin with. (2% fee) 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:54:55
And you get your information from where? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:11:56
thank you!!
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:58:46
this needs to be on the front page

You need to be banned from All you do is spread FUD/talk shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:38:08
really? so i can't sell my 1 gox coin for .05 bitcoins right now? and take those .05 bitcoins and sell them on coinbase? are you saying that's impossible? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:10:48
Nice try, Patrick

so it's a picture of karpeles cat on a keyboard and an IRC chat between somebody who may or may not be karpeles... 
This means NOTHING.

my girlfriend is japanese... asking her now. i'll keep you posted. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:57:49
well what are you going to do? it's his responsibility to make sure things like this don't happen. i didn't even get a response from him and I want my 5 gox coins back, it's my money.. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:31:26
Pointless post. Flagged
