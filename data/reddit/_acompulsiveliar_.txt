Yes, I'm sure your average consumer loves it when their currency can lose 20% purchasing power within a week

Pretty sure you're a minority, you go to the average American and offer them the ability to pay less tax and they'll jump right at it.

Not that I agree or disagree with your sentiment on btc but the way you talk brings down Reddit IQ more than anything else

So have a bunch of other cryptos. Why is btc better?

As it stands bitcoin has absolutely no chance of becoming a worldwide currency. Without a governing body or some sort of regulation, its volatility makes it unfeasible and unattractive as anything more than an investment asset or to buy illegal shit.
If anything you're delusional about why fiat currencies dominate the way they do.

Hindsight is 20/20 you literally have no clue when the peak is until you see it drop off.

I mean. It doesn't matter if you support them or not lmao. It's an economic superpower and the rest of the world will listen to them when they say the USD has value. You can keep living in your own fantasy but that doesn't stop the USD from having a very solid and secure value, no matter what immorality you may feel it's backed by.
