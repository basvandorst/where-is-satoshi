That makes sense; as I said in the OP, since I use my debit card I cannot make foreign transactions. Did you pay with debit, if so do you know if you can make foreign transactions with your debit card? Because if that's the case along with the post above, I'm going to have to assume coinbase is just billing from Europe now and I can't make instant transactions anymore because I'd rather not get a credit card right now; bummer.

Damn, that's ridiculous, but sadly not surprising. Can you sell it using a paypal account to send the USD to?


I was kind of holding out hope that it was some kind of error on one end or the other, I figured "Well they didn't make any big announcements about moving; you'd think a company as large as coinbase would tell their consumers before they completely cut some of them off from buying btc."

By foreign transactions, I mean my bank doesn't let me use my debit for purchases abroad because of concerns about fraud.


Lol dude I know your pain I had to contact them to get it working.

It seems that Advcash, as well, is based in the U.K. They charge from the U.S., as well though, right? Creating this thread made me realize that I need a CC.

In regards to CEX and coinmama, I know they're both based in the U.K., are you sure they charge from the U.S.? If so, sweet. btc-e and exmo both look interesting, and I may try them, but I've never used Advcash, so idk. But CEX, if they do charge from the U.S., looks to be my best bet, thanks.
Edit: Welp never mind in regards to card purchases, CEX said service not available in your state. So I guess they're out the window.
