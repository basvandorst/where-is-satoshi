The point is that it will never be a viable currency when it is volatile.
Why would I spend bitcoin on a car... When I might be able to buy 2 cars for the same number of coins next week.  Or maybe my savings will be worth half as much next week. 
This environment makes people buy and hold.  You need to be willing to spend your currency as and when you need goods and services. 
At the minute the money I spend on a car today, could maybe buy me a house in 5 years... So maybe I shouldn't buy the car. 
Bitcoin will never be a currency until its stable.

Boom!  Now it's all profit. No matter what.

It has no chance of becoming a currency until it is stable. 
If I buy a chocolate bar for £1... I know it will cost me about the same in a few months. 
If I buy a chocolate bar with 0.00001 bitcoin, then in a few months that same amount of bitcoin might get me 30 chocolate bars due to the change in btc value. 
So I am incentivised to never spend my coin.  That's terrible for the economy and makes for a completely untrustworthy currency.

But what if other coins (like Eth) take a larger percentage of crypto market share?  What if bitcoin is superceded.
It's still relatively early days in terms of crypto.

Thanks for that response.
I do understand all of that... But what I was asking is why he specifically thinks it is worth $20k and $100k...  He chose specific figures and I wonder if it was pure speculation, or if he had some reason in for those values.

Can you give me a tldr on the free coins??

Haha... You're kinda supporting my point.
You'd never keep your current account/spending cash in bitcoin.
It's good for gambleing/investment if you wanna hold or day trade, cuz it's a roller coaster.... But it's too volatile for budgeting your family's day to day costs.

We are talking about Bitcoin being a currency?! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:42:48
This wasn't an answer at all.
It's like someone selling a steak for $5 and saying it should be closer to $20.
And when asked, why is the steak worth $20, he is give the answer
"Because it's at least worth $100 and people still don't get it. But don't worry we are getting there."
Why do you think it should be closer to 20k... And why do you think it's worth at least 100k?

The word "might" was in that sentence.
It's so unpredictable...  That's the point.  People won't use it to buy stuff regularly, if it continues to fluctuate in value so wildly. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:57:11
True.  I guess I'm talking about it being THE currency and replacing Fiat.  That will happen some day (I believe) but not til after volitility has passed

If you really have 100.... It wouldn't hurt to take out bits over time... So you're earning something from the investment... That way if it completely goes through the floor, you've still come out ahead. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:20:07
Agreed.  But different people use different logic for their guesses, so I was curious to how this guy got to that number. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:08:23
Sorry dude... I appreciate you responding. But it still misses my question.
I understand the benefits of bitcoin.  I understand the use cases.  I own bitcoin.
But it is currently worth $5000 per bitcoin.
This guy is saying it's worth $20k, and when asked why it's worth $20k, the answer that came back was "because it should be worth $100k".
I am asking why should it be worth 20 or 100.  Why is 5k not the appropriate value for all of those benefits.
I'm hearing wild speculation on future or untapped worth of the coin, but I want to know what logic or thought has come up with these speculative values.
So far (although I appreciate the responses) the replies are about the benefits of bitcoin.  I understand that, I just don't know how that led us to "it should be worth $100k already"
