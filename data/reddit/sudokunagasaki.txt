Nice try, NSA.

Yeah, he even has a punchable *name*.  Sounds like that of a 70's porn star.

I don't really know much about this guy, but he sure does have a punchable face.

I don't think it means what you think it means.

Here's one:  The Bitcoin Foundation.

And yet the Classic blocks keep piling up bit by bit.

Just because the world *doesn't* run without debt doesn't necessarily mean that it *can't*.

You didn't grow it from zero, you grew it in the economic soil that society provided for you.

Yeah, what a total wanker.  What the fuck does killing people for money have to do undermining a cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:20:32
OK, thanks.

Isn't that just the ledger?  Anyway, I've never heard of 'coinbase' being used aside from the name of the company, so it must be a pretty obscure technical term.  Whereas 'blockchain' is a real buzzword in its own right.

'Blockchain' already meant something.  What did 'coinbase' mean before it was used for the company name?
