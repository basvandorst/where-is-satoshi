Good job nobody trusts the banks 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:15:20
Good question
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:04:15
Jamie is actually the CEO of JP Morgan, but I am sure they're also planning similar steps
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:42:23
Some use Monero now, but originally it was just bitcoin. Some marketplaces still only use bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:22:38
To be fair one of the most common uses for bitcoin in the early days was for buying illegal goods on the deep web. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:49:45
To say anything less than 25% of all bitcoin transactions back then were for illegal purposes would be ignorant. It doesn't matter how cheap they were, at least 2% of all bitcoin that existed were seized on that day alone from just 1 marketplace. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:09:46
When was this?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:33:22
Nobody knows for sure because there haven't been any studies done on possibly the most illegal operation of the modern world. Nobody is gunna open the doors for 'proper studies' 
I'm just saying you can't underestimate the impact the deep web had on the increase in bitcoin usage. Of course there were other uses, but 2% of all bitcoin was seized from just one marketplace. That's pretty significant
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:32:20
There is no source, but the deep web was one of the first available ways to use bitcoin and it let to a huge increase in demand for Bitcoin. 144,000 bitcoin were seized from Silk Road alone. There were only around 11 million bitcoin in circulation back then. DPR reportedly had another 144,000 btc in his wallet. This was only scratching the surface considering the marketplace had been running for 2  years, there would have been millions of bitcoin passing through. Not to mention the other deep web marketplaces. I think it's safe to say the deep web played a large part in the success of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:02:30
I beg to differ
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:20:07
It would be pretty funny to watch tho
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:39:57
Any examples?
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:42:02
!RemindMe 11 months from now! 
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:05:55
Surely this would cause the price to go down? DNMs have played a huge part in bitcoin getting as valuable as it is!
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:45:27
Nice, well done &amp; good calling it early! What price &amp; how much did you buy in for? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:52:32
But BTC on local bitcoins then transfer to bittrex where you can buy almost every cryptocurrency. Hopefully they work in Dubai! Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:02:36
Just trying to help. It wouldn't be sustainable otherwise. It costs 80p-£1 to send each one so although just 'Buy Bitcoin' would be best, we couldn't carry on. It's like crowdfunding for bitcoin advertising 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:14:08
My friend bought £100 worth when the price was £2200. He now wants to sell it (£3000) and has made £50 profit. I keep telling him to hold but he wants out
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:11:11
We're planning to invest in any coin which appears to be a good price
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:28:26
We will be using the money to do more things to get the word out, we are not doing this for profit, every penny is going toward more bitcoin advertising
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:28:12
That's if it continues at the current rate. And the likelyhood is it will only increase even faster! So excited for next year!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:41:02
I hope so. They're making good moves toward making it a reality so fingers crossed
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:06:14
Me and a friend in the same situation in May, bitcoin was £1500 and I was shitting myself. Bitcoin isn't slowing unless the internet breaks down 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:21:36
You can actually buy with zero fees! GDax exchange is owned by the same company that own coinbase. Search on YouTube for the video it's actually really easy. 0 fees
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:57:13
I have a friend in Zimbabwe. If I send her my bitcoin and she sells it, sends me the money then I buy it back here will that work? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:09:08
I agree! The snowball is gathering more and more speed!
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:59:22
Congratulations it must feel amazing! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:16:36
Ahaha the loan wasn't for £10k unfortunately as our credit scores wouldn't allow that high. However we now have a nice amount of crypto and my Tesla will probably be black! I'm hoping to see $100k bitcoin by this time next year! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:02:22
Do it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:08:16
�� $6k by mid 2018 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:34:06
Japan and the US are biggest but just think when China re - enter ;)
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:35:45
haha Bitcoin hits 190k "is it too late to buy?"
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:55:12
This is probably a very real scenario for hundreds if not thousands of people haha
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:20:02
haha who knows! I doubt it though because the plot line looks to be that one of the characters finds an old laptop with Bitcoin on from years ago
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:00:44
I dunno but it always works out the same for me, depends which trade you select too, if you don't match the criteria for the cheapest and have to scroll down to more expensive one 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:37:07
Local bitcoins is the best, the buyer sends you the money via bank transfer
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:51:35
Any time I buy from local bitcoins, I check how much id get from coinbase with fees and it always works out pretty much the same
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:43:02
Not a chance
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:19:46
SO MANY FORKING FORKS
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:17:51
Bitcoin was never created for small transactions, it's more a store of value and better to be used for large transactions. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:12:26
"It may be a fraud but we can still make money from it"
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:55:52
It's still there for me 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:57:43
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:34:13
Buy as many as you can afford to. It will probably be the most lucrative investment you could ever make. Bitcoin is unstoppable. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:54:15
That was fucking brilliant to read haha thank you for sharing
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:33:57
Interesting, thanks for sharing, I was under the impression that coinbase was just a Bitcoin exchange and it was the first Bitcoin payment method I came across when looking into setting up Bitcoin payments. Do you know of a way I can accept payments at checkout without using coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:12:49
My cooking is so fabulous even the smoke alarm cheers me on
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:16:20
There an interesting documentary on Netflix about his story. I believe it simple called dark web
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:06:17
Don't worry we're in the same boat haha just interesting to look at the extreme wins, I'm sure we will all be posting our success stories when BTC lands on the moon!
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:48:01
I know it's weird but it's the only website I have and wanted to shout about it and share with my friends!!! In regards accepting payment, I intend to accept bitcoin very soon but I'm having trouble integrating my coinbase account with my shopify. I think it's the API key? Something like that can't remember exactly, but I don't have a clue what the redirect address needs to be if anyone can help?
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:10:06
People in the U.K of course
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:15:33
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:45:08
Get out from under my bridge then
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:19:39
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:10:15
Isn't it too late to say that?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:36:47
I'll buy some at $500 :D
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:12:58
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:05:30
GOOD LUCK!
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:01:40
Nice! What was the price when you acquired them?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:42:03
Coinbase is rubbish when it comes to buying, but I like the UI so use it to hold my BTC and ETH. I buy from local bitcoins, then use a bridge (I use shapeshift) to transfer either ETH or LTC into my coinbase wallet if needs be. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:07:52
Sorry I can't offer any advice and I only hold a relatively small number of coins but good luck with whatever happens!
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:01:44
You could all make a fund, each investing a small amount to begin with, ownIng a percentage relative to your investment. Buy a variety of cryptocurrencies and hope they boom as most of them are at the moment! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:30:31
What exchange lol? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:52:25
The bitshares desktop wallet is great. You can buy, trade and store ethereum, Bitcoin, bitshares, steem, dash &amp; more! 
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:51:36
The future will be kind to you
