Yup,... anything more than what I have now seems to me like a shitload.

Dammit, I am trying my best to get more money to the exchange,...  
 Just hold,... a few more days,...   
then panic again please?

YES, but,... with a very fast half-life...  
Why did you think I came to crypto-currencies?

I doubt that "buying more Bitcoin or another CC than we can" would solve anything for the banks/governments...  the problem for  them is that there is not enough control I would guess. The only way to be able to get in control is by writing the code and getting everybody on that,... oh wait? Isn't that what we saw here:

3600 and heading down, after having tapped the 3900 mark

Loving it :)

A lot of sound advice here :) so just going to add my 2 cents as well:  
Buy a cold storage, put BTC on it,...   
Hide cold storage for a few months/years and get on with life, and give yourself a Xmass present or B-day present of the cold storage with the 2 BTC on and check price then and thank your younger self by then ;)

Putting thins in perspective:  
In 2007 I had a shitload of intercourse   
 In 2009 I got married, so only had sex with my wife -50%   
 In 2010 we got a child so less sex, only about 1x/week - 86%  
 In  2017 we got our second child,...    
I seem to have lost all my intercourse-credits,...  
I turned to crypto-currency: the odds are still better here...

Ah so that is not due to my bad reputation with them?
