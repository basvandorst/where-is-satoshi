Question how would you go around implementing this then?... I've been wanting to do something with blockchain but I can't find a way on how to avoid placing out a token in the process...

Do newbies who have witnessed how these big instuitutions work in stocks and other conventional forms of investment fall under this line?...

Oh yis yis boi i'am this is more amusing than the stock market tbh...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:16
I'm technically anticipating it. It'll give me a chance to average up... but then again if the big institutions bought it at a higher price I've technically won right?...

Never had anyway to buy into it only when it hit 6k I think the problem at the time I thought you needed to buy the whole coin somewhat similar to stocks didn't help that the exchange rate at the time was 50php/usd... it also didn't help that I knew nothing about '08 and why bitcoin was invented basically it was a mix of lack of information and the control of the system...
