Insider trading is where people with privileged knowledge "insiders" have the opportunity to make plays in the market that are enormously lucrative to them, and which, importantly, rely on the rest of the market not being able to act on the same knowledge.
In this case, employees of Coinbase were aware that Bitcoin Cash would be listed within a particular time, if not down to the day then certainly to the week. Because many market actors have no idea how to buy crypto and have no experience with traditional exchanges, coinbase is by far the most mainstream buying portal into the market. Long story short, if a new coin is added to coinbase, people (like yourself, no offense) who don't really have any idea what is going on will take it as a sign of confidence and buy in, and that coin's price is almost guaranteed to sharply rise in the short term.
When Bitcoin Cash was added yesterday its shot up sevenfold before settling down at almost 300% of its market price that morning. Which means that Bitcoin Cash employees, and their families and friends, had a dubiously ethical route to very substantial profit. Now there's significant evidence emerging, some on this forum, that this kind of buying happened, and probably at a relatively large scale.
And that's why people are leaving Coinbase. Because they don't want to feel like a business that many are using as a surrogate *bank* is actively using their ignorance to leverage massive gains. Which is understandable. 
Would there have been a run on Bitcoin Cash upon its addition anyway? Absolutely. Would there have been a bunch of Coinbase employees' spouses and friends and parents and children with huge bags who called off work that day to hover over the sell button? Absolutely not.

He had access to the entire seed with one character incorrect, which is a spectacularly different situation than this, or the one you described.
