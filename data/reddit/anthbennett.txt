Annnnnnd you are now a target. Great work, but probably not best to post how much you have on Reddit.

Might be a little controversial (so bye made up internet points) but am I the only one that thinks these stats are misleading? I’m a big fan of BTC, but I don’t think saying BTC returned 9 million % is a way to lure in investors. BTC was not considered an investment 10 years ago, maybe 5 years ago you could argue this, and this gives a much lower %. Now it’s a great way to balance a portfolio and should be marketed this way. To continuing to sell it as an asset that went from fractions of a cent to $10k will be not be considered by institutional investors as a reason to get in.

Not to point out the obvious, but the comparison is to the mania, not to it's utility, and judging by the charts it can be justified.

Can’t believe people have paper in 2044. I was really hoping for holograms by then

It will happen slow, and then all at once.

I think I heard this on a padcast, going from memory, but custody for institutions move btc around to make it more difficult to hack, as it's harder to hack a moving target rather than one stagnated address with all the coins.
