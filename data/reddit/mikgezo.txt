So what exactly stops people from just moving it in multiple payments of $10k or less?
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:10:58
Dollar cost average is always the best strategy. Ignore the price for the most part and just buy small amounts every week as you can afford it. When you get in profit, decide to keep buying or ride the wave. MOON HODL LAMBO YEET. Cash out when you're happy with profit.

I've had a Bitcoin full node + lightning node running on a Raspberry Pi 3B (which only has 1GB or RAM) so you should be able to get it running on a Raspberry Pi 4 without any issues I would think. Unless there's something obvious I'm missing. I used this guide to get it working:  [

I've got one step better that you could do, look into something called Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm. You can turn your seed in 'n' parts and restore the seed from 'n-1' parts. So if one part of the seed was destroyed or stolen it wouldn't matter, as it would be useless on its own. Then you can take the necessary precautions to restore your seed if need be, or just move the coins to a new place and get a new seed.

I think the biggest reason is security. As far as I know the hash ratio is such that 1.6% of the BTC network could 51% attack the BCH network. Not saying that they would, but it's practically impossible for that to happen on the BTC network.
That and BCH is trying a lot of experimental and questionable stuff (bigger blocks and hard forks) that are not as tried and tested as the BTC protocol that continues to run very reliably. I also don't think bigger blocks are all that important, since every transaction really doesn't need to be recorded on the blockchain (I'm happy to put my coffee through the lightning network any day).
For those reasons, I prefer to keep the vast majority in BTC, but I wouldn't completely count out BCH as a reliable payment network if they keep developing.

My idea was to use a Linux Live boot so it's basically a clean install offline and it doesn't save to anywhere (since I even had no hard drives plugged in). Hardware wallets still have 24 word recovery seeds that need protecting, so my aim was to protect that seed.
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:20:07
I ran Raspibolt on a Pi 3B previously and it was a pretty good experience (uplugged at the moment since I'm moving soon but will get it back online). Had it running a full node and lightning node. I used my main PC to get the blockchain initially and then it stayed synced without an issue. Never got as far as to run my own Electrum server (yet) but it's on my to do list one day!
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:44:21
Yeah, this is outside of the ledger environment. It just takes any 24 word seed a splits it into a number of other 24 word seeds that when put back together give you the original 24 word see. But the trick is you don't need all the parts, just a certain number of the parts in the right order.
I personally used this Stack Overflow page to put together my solution:  [ 
I used the answer provided by the user  [Kevin Cernekee]( 
It works great for me, I have a few distributed around the place knowing that if one ever goes missing, I can restore it from the others, move the coins, and create a new seed. My strong recommendation is to do anything involving the seeds on an air gapped computer and to write all the seeds down by hand (no printing). I also would recommend using a Linux Live disc and booting from that, so when you shutdown all traces of the seeds are gone as they are never saved to a hard drive. Call me paranoid, but I took a lot of precautions! :D

Australian here! I've used Coinspot and BTCMarkets and both have worked great for me (I transfer most of my coins off the exchange). I think the withdrawal fee on BTCMarkets is slightly cheaper when compared to Coinspot though.

A lot of the bigger exchanges also do over-the-counter (OTC) stuff. Just check out something like Coinbase Prime or any other exchange that sounds good and see if they have an OTC service!
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:07:38
Ah yes, I didn't quite understand that point either, my bad! I thought it was to do with the difference of directly interacting with the blockchain (Bitcoin Core) and connecting to nodes (Electrum).
It looks like the whole deterministic thing is to do with the way the binaries are compiled from their source code. Deterministic meaning anyone that compiles the source code will get the exact same binary, and non-deterministic being a possibly different binary in some small way (for some reason). I found a stack exchange post that has some good info, but it looks like it's getting pretty technical!
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:03:14
I think it's helpful to differentiate Bitcoin from an online token like WoW Gold or something. Cause from the outside, I know a lot of people just view it as an online token and have no idea about the inbuilt scarcity. And how that scarcity is guaranteed by the code, algorithms, mining power, consensus, etc, and that's why it has value!

Technically I only saw it go down to around $7300. But just look at the volume and all the major resistances Bitcoin just blasted through. If this goes back down to $7200 it will be the biggest fake out in the history of fake outs... maybe ever!

You can buy Bitcoin with a debit card from within the blue wallet. It redirects you to a place ChangeNow. I have personally never used it but reviews online seem ok. There are other decentralised exchanges online that don't require ID but the one that comes to mind for me is bisq. Perhaps just buy a small amount the first time to make sure it's working, then buy as much as you're comfortable with from then on. Best of luck!
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:54:24
Cause they'll make more money at this point if they just buy Bitcoin instead of trying to take down the network. I know what I would do if I was in their position!

Nah can't go from a specified date as far as I know, you can try a 'pruned' mode but I think you still need to download the whole blockchain to sync your wallet on Bitcoin core. Second question is definitely a yes, you can transfer your Bitcoin wherever you want. But there's not much point in keeping it online unless you plan on trading or spending it soon.
You could avoid using Bitcoin core wallet (I know it is the safest way) and save the huge download and try one of the methods suggested here:  [ . Just be careful to guard your private key, everyone wants to steal your coins!

You can use Coinspot which is an Australian exchange. They have a minimum age of 16 and require ID if you want to go down that path (and that suits your needs).

Well either the price will increase fast enough for the reward decrease, or miners will start giving up and the miners that remain will get a larger mining reward. It's a pretty good balance, but there's always the chance it won't be enough and people give up on bitcoin all together (though I think that's a rather unlikely scenario).
@_date: 2019-10-05 08:40:46
I think this is likely, as the block reward drops the value of BTC goes up. At the current rate, the value of BTC is increasing far greater than the block reward is dropping so I think we're good for a while!

Get a mobile wallet like blue wallet:  [ 
or maybe a paper wallet:  [ 
or perhaps you want to store your keys on a hardware wallet:  [ 
then the trick is getting some Bitcoin:  [ 
There's a few ways to do each of these things but I just pasted a link to the first one that came to mind. Internet searches will be your friend here, and make sure you backup your seed for whatever wallet you use! Good luck, just ask questions if you need more help!
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:51:36
I'll take my best shot at answering your questions, anyone else feel free to add if I've missed some points or got a few things slightly wrong.
If you use Bitcoin Core you'll have the complete history of the Blockchain (the 200GB you need to download) and you'll stay synced with the blockchain while it's running (you're essentially running a Bitcoin full node at this point). When you make transactions you broadcast directly to the network, based on the exact latest blockchain.
If you use electrum, you won't download any of the blockchain and you will connect to a number of Bitcoin full nodes instead. You make your transaction through Electrum and the program sends the transaction to connected Bitcoin full nodes. Electrum won't always pick the same nodes, and there have even been instances of malicious nodes broadcasting fake download error messages to users (this has been patched a while ago).
I've used Electrum before and it's worked great for me. But I also run my own full node off a Raspberry Pi (currently offline but I'll get it back online on day).

I use a Ledger but I've heard that Ledger does have some closed source parts to its code, unlike Trezor. I've been using Ledger for a while now and so far no problems! Just make sure you buy the device from the official site whichever way you go. Don't go hunting for a bargain cause those devices could have had malicious code uploaded to them!

If you're downloading the entire blockchain from scratch I think you're looking at around 250GB. Then downloading a block every 10 minutes going forward, depending on it's size you're looking at adding a few hundred MB per day! Something like that!

Thanks for the Sats 1317WM! I've seen the bot around and became familiar with the way it works yesterday.

I like to use Electrum. Fairly simple and easy to set a higher or lower fee depending on what you want for that particular transaction. I also use BlueWallet on mobile which also lets you choose your fee!
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:31:23
Exchanges have a series of withdrawal and deposit protocols (that they have designed) that interact with the blockchain. One small vulnerability in that system and they can say goodbye to any coins in their hot wallet (that is a wallet that is connected to the internet to make the requested withdrawals and handle deposits).
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:14:53
Depending on the wallet you use, you can get the fees down to 1 sat/byte which is effectively 0.00000226 BTC or about 2 cents (or even lower if you use segwit). These transactions may take a lot longer to clear depending on how many transactions are in the mempool however, it depends how quickly you need that transaction to confirm. I normally just go for a 1 sat/byte and just wait as long as needed for it to go through, since I'm usually in no rush. I've seen them confirm in minutes and sometimes it's taken hours.
@_date: 2019-01-02 10:47:17
Pretty much yes, since more people are mining the same blocks and the reward for the block remains constant, miners will on average get less BTC for the same amount of work (especially since a lot of mining is done in pools and the reward is split amongst miners). Keep in mind it works the other way too. Just a month or two ago there was a sharp decline and it got easier to mine, and therefore miners started making more BTC from it. You can have a look at the current and past hash rate here if you're interested in how it has been fluctuating as of late!
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:10:49
Nothing to do with price. It just means it got 10% more difficult for the miners. But the only reason it got harder is because more people started mining it again. The idea is no matter how many people mine it, the block times should be approximately the same.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:40:04
When you use leverage trading you pay the fees on the total amount after leverage. So for $100 at 100x leverage your fee would be (assuming 0.075% fee on buy and sell)
$100 \* 100 \* 0.0015 = $15
An ROE of 20% would give something like $20
So if there was a small fluctuation and you sold at market value (which would likely have been a bit lower than the value you saw) this would explain why you effectively made no money.
In my opinion, 100x leverage trading is near straight up gambling (Bitcoin only needs to drop 1% in value and you lose the whole $100 if you long). Don't let me tell you what to do with your money but 100x is scary for me!

Looking at what's happened in the last bear market, it looks like we're heading up to retest the 6k level at some point (might be a little wobbly along the way). If we don't break above 6k we're probably going to see true capitulation crashing pretty hard down into the 2k levels.
I'm just basing this on the last bear market ,which this one has been following pretty closely. But it is Bitcoin, so anything can happen. Perhaps we have already had our final selloff? If I could accurately predict the future I probably wouldn't be telling people anyway. &gt;:)
