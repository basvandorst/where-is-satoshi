Not sure I follow. The last data point on that chart is from Sunday, May 24th, where there are 2840 "Counterparty" bitcoin transactions and 87996 total bitcoin transactions in a 24 hour period, which amounts to 3.2%. All transaction data is visible by clicking on a specific daily spike

I'm not sure the XCP part is really supposed to be used as a currency where greater volume on exchanges = greater success. Even price is more or less irrelevant to anyone but speculators as the main purpose of XCP is anti-spam, and automatically escrowable token -- the asset registration fee could be automatically bumped and an alternate token is able to be used in lieu of xcp. 
As far as the protocol in it's current form dictates you don't need to bother with XCP at all, you can just use Bitcoin. (which is mainly what I'm doing - using a bit of bitcoin dust to register free numerical assets for testing!) I think these extensions have possibility to add great utility to the blockchain and therefore increase the ultimate valuation of bitcoin- the token required to ride the blockchain
Measuring the total amount of daily XCP transactions on the bitcoin network each day / total amount of daily bitcoin transactions it seems to average out about 2%.   
So one in every 50 bitcoin transaction is actually also a counterparty transaction. I would not describe that as "it's happening" but not totally insignificant either when you consider this is something massively under the radar at this time
The (purely theoretical) growth predictions should we see a "killer app" onboard or NASDAQ/medici like trial come to fruiton are quite interesting to imagine.
