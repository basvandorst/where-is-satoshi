You're not wrong. [At some point there has to be a ceiling]( Certainly when the value of all Bitcoins in existence outbalances the entire wealth of the human race.
Back-of-the-envelope calculation I just made: Total value of all Bitcoins in existence is roughly 161.8 billion dollars.

You can still buy in fractionally now, right?

Um, it's Reddit. The vast majority of subs for $SUBJECT are comprised of people jerking themselves off about $SUBJECT.
That being said, if someone can drop a few dollars and have fun daydreaming about how rich they're going to be, go for it. It's got to be no worse a vice than slot machines, horse races, fantasy football, or betting on the stock market.

Me, I tend to treat Bitcoin as a collectible commodity. I've been a physical-coin collector and a trading card game collector, and see BTC as the same vein.
Yes, technically it's a currency and it's decentralized, but that's just the production standpoint. For the end user (me) it's just like if I buy a frosted proof set from the US Mint every year. Yes, technically, I could spend the coins as legal tender, but that's not their main purpose.

That's great, I'm so glad you dumbasses are turning everything into a political witch hunt.
I'm here because an arrow and a big number show up next to Bitcoin's name every month, more so than stocks, collectibles, and other investments. I piss on your politics, agenda, and personal army.
If BC fails, it's just you morons who killed it. Fortunately, I didn't sink any more into it than I could comfortably afford to lose, as I continue to exercise the jurisprudence that has seen me through many markets for decades.

Sweetheart, this is Reddit. Shills are the weather here. We get shilled when somebody has a brain tumor over what to name a navy boat. We get shilled over stupid shit. There's uncountable bots running around spreading chaos. Being flooded with shills is what you get for joining one of the militant tin-foil-hat Bitcoin forums, and if anybody is targeting them, it's one of your own, with no motive beyond playing whack-a-mole with the voices in their own head.
**WHOM** exactly is supposed to be on the other side of this? Whom is supposed to be doing this shilling? A government agency? A business? An ancient order? Who in the real world actually gives a shit?

Yeah thanks, but shhhh, don't tell *those guys over there*.
Ahem, anyway, we're sure glad Bitcoin will never again be threatened by the Enemies of Liberty, aren't we?

Any "currency" which tries to work against healthy capitalist motivations is doomed to fail. I'll take my money without the Che Guevara Tshirt, thank you very much.
Now, what's it going to be? Are you guys going to choke Bitcoin back down to the triple-digits so I can afford to buy into a bigger stake, or will this temper tantrum blow over and let my modest stake resume its climb to reasonable payoff in awhile?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:03:57
That's actually the healthy way to look at it. If you got out for an investment's more than you got in with, you win.
Did I buy in late and too little? Yes. If Bitcoin goes to the moon, I'll still only make a modest profit. But it will still be (actually already has been) a far greater return than I could have expected on other investments.
Crying because you weren't greedy enough is how gamblers get addicted and lose big.

For the love of God, Bitcoin is still at $7.7K. WHAT harm has been done? It dipped last week while you were all having a shitstorm about it, then as soon as you shut up it climbed right back up again.
All you have to do is just. shut. up. All markets, an immutable law across all markets whether you're trading in birdseed or platinum, all markets thrive on *stability* and suffer from *instability*. When you open your big stupid mouth and rant online, the market sees "there's trouble in Bitcoin, better dump it!"
You guys are literally going to crash this because you could not let Bitcoin be Bitcoin and tried to make it your Bolshevik revolution.

Yeah, look, that "People's Republik of Bitcoin" attitude is just one camp in Bitcoin. The other one has the same attitude you have - treat it like a commodity like gold, Morgan silver dollars, Magic The Gathering cards, what have you. That's why some of us are here, buy in for some chump change and see if we can sell it later for big bucks. Win, we're easy millionaires. Lose, we lost some beer money and get to tell funny stories at the reunion.
However, no collectible I've ever seen has produced as much popcorn as this week has! Just saying, we're not all soap opera queens trying to turn this into a Bolshevik Revolution.

Look at a pile of shit long enough and you'll see the face of the virgin Mary, too!


HUGE CROCK OF BULLSHIT!!! BC is a commodity like Morgan silver dollars, MTG trading cards, and Beanie babies. The only enemies are the shadows you're making on the wall to spook yourself and everybody watching.

Today is not a good day to be a newbie in Bitcoin. Don't worry, it'll blow over.
What happened: So Bitcoin was going to fork, then changed its mind and decided not to fork, and as you see at the top of the changes the first item is more defense against forking.
That should be the end of it, but Bitcoin is coincidentally experiencing a small dip in value this week. There's two camps in Bitcoin. One (me and others like me) are just here for the investment, because a little money in can equal a lot of money out later and if it doesn't work out, fuck it, my buy-in was only cigarette money anyway. 
The other camp is a paranoid collective of anarcho-capitalist Randroid Libertarians with a hard copy of *Atlas Shrugged* up their ass who are morally convinced that Bitcoin's destiny is to replace money and banks and the Federal Reserve and then we'll all be Sovereign Citizens dancing on the ashes of the Fed while Saint Ron Paul passes the joints around.
Party A is shrugging this week off with a chuckle. Party B is convinced Goldman Saks and the Illumminatti and a certain ethnicity widely associated with usury are responsible for the price dip and attempt to fork. So it's edgy right now.
We're both on the witch hunt list just for having this conversation, by the way.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:47
Checking the prices on *anything* every 10 minutes is stressful! Treat Bitcoin like a commodity, like you were investing in Beanie Babies or US Mint proof sets. Never spend more than you can afford to lose, then stash it away and see if it pays off in a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:50:21
Since when is Bitcoin "under attack"? By who? Why isn't that news?
And don't dare tell me this is all about Segwit2x. Once there was to be a fork, then there is no fork. "Attacks" require "enemies."

Can I just ask: Is it OK for me to invest in BitCoin the way I would invest in any other commodity, such as Morgan silver dollars or Magic: The Gathering cards or anything else? I don't have to have an anarchy tattoo or a political agenda or join some army?
This is the one thing turning me off from BitCoin. Dressing it up in an Anonymous retard mask and going all  on it is going to do more damage than a thousand Chinas.

Gaining 5% in value over ten years is peanuts - that will be the leveling off point. But right now we're looking at gaining 66% just this last month. I'm sure you don't have to be an economics major to understand that that can't keep happening for month after month steady for the next decade, right?
Don't get me wrong, it's a nice ride right now and that's why I'm here. The actual best case scenario is the one happening now: diversification. One cryptocurrency is a fluke. But we have several, in Etherium, Litecoin, and others, also doing well, showing a sustainable market that somebody out there's willing to invest in.
I'm just saying, comparing BTC to USD is baloney. There's no way the world could adapt BTC right now as its daily pocket currency, it would be like carrying a purse of platinum around. Some depressed economies are using it that way because it's better than starving. Vendors are more than thrilled to accept being paid in a virtual currency that's going to outperform their 401(K), US Savings Bonds, and a forklift of silver bars rolled together. That doesn't mean it's feasible to carry large scale business.
But the future *could* hold a blockchain currency that's modified to be sustainable as a printed fiat currency. This is the Wild West days of cryptocurrency, where we're discovering the rules as they happen.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:29:18
Well, yes and no.
Everybody in here raves about inflation and how it's destroying fiat paper currency. But the opposite problem, deflation, is what Bitcoin has already plunged into headlong.
*Deflation* is when an economy becomes stagnant because the money is *too* valuable. Let's stop kidding ourselves - if Bitcoin shot up to where you could buy a sportscar with one, would you **actually spend it on a sportscar**? No, because tomorrow it's going to be worth two sportscars.
See where that's going? Already it's impractical to talk about whole Bitcoins - we're dealing in tiny fractions of them now. Already you hear people kicking themselves for spending them early on.
None of you may want to hear it, but **all** infinite curves in economics are unsustainable. Just like it's a miserable situation to have wheelbarrows of Zimbabwe currency to afford one loaf of bread, it's also not a good place to be in when you're agonizing over spending a fraction of a Satoshi.
Hopefully, the market levels off by a decade from now. That's the best case scenario, because otherwise it's going to fishhook and crash. When one unit of currency is suddenly worth the entire planet, it's then worth nothing but bragging rights to own one.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:31:04
You mean the mobile app? Reviews on that one are pessimistic.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:13:50
Well, see, here's the thing: Someday, there will be no more Bitcoins. We will mine the last one, and then that's all the Bitcoins there will ever be in the world.
Now if we actually have Bitcoin as a world-wide currency, that's a disaster, and it's why we don't use diamonds, gold, etc. for currency. Because a currency must have some expansion room. The world's population is always increasing, and part of the function of capitalism is to *create* wealth - See, I bought this bag of plastic resin for $5 and molded it into a set of chairs to sell for $200 - where does the extra $195 come from? We create wealth all the time with our labor, and changing goods into more valuable goods.
If you have a set amount of Bitcoin to distribute to the world and tell them that's all the money they're ever going to get, nobody's going to spend it. It will be too scarce to spend, even divided into billions of decimal places.

Can we *NOT* have Pepe memes in here? It's [associated with Nazis]( and [Reddit just started a crackdown on hate-groups](
I would really like to be able to recommend Bitcoin as a viable investment so its value goes up. Making my friends recoil from 4chan memes associated with hate groups is counter-productive.

People don't understand what ["Ponzi scheme"]( means.
A Ponzi scheme is literally an infinite pyramid of "greater fools" which needs to keep expanding, eventually running out of literal people and then crashing. We keep seeing stories of "overnight Bitcoin millionaires" which drives people to associate the two.
In reality, it's more like a collectibles market (Beanie Babies, etc.) crossed with a commodities market (stocks, bonds). We've actually never *seen* anything like this in history, there's no telling how cryptocurrencies will play out in the long run.
Which is why you see the sober advice on here so often: Never invest more than you could comfortably afford to lose. Me, I sink a small sum into all three of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, with the same strategy I'd apply in an aggressive-yield stock portfolio. I also don't spend more than I'd spend on any of my other hobbies and collectibles.

You know, if you run around shoving a microphone into the face of every suit in New York, you will find no end of negative opinions about Bitcoin or anything else for that matter.

No, that's not really damning, GPlay reviews aren't an ironclad indicator, just I wasn't sure if you meant the app or some faucet website.
