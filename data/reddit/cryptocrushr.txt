(a) Still make a lot of money but money still centralized, (b) Still make money be part of revolution (c) don't see that happening at all

There are positives and negatives. Some people sit back and never say a word about things that matter and directly effect their lives in non favorable ways. I applause anybody that can stand up and fight for what they believe in. Everybody can teach you something that you don't know. It doesn't matter who it is. Always be a student. Always filter the information

As crazy as Alex Jones comes across he knows exactly what he's talking about. I always have a hard time telling what side he's on though. Is he a puppet as well or does he truly want to help people? ��

They may or may not be part of the same conspiracy. If they are a part of it then you know how much power they have and also know that they will most likely prevail in their plans as history has shown. In that case even though they'd  still have control over our money and perpetuate with their ways, you'd STILL get the benefit of being an early investor and will make a lot IF you invest early. Other scenereo, Satoshi is a true hero and you are part of the revolution. Either way both sides of the token look very good for financial gains, but one side of the coin is super shiny with the possibility to be one of the best things in monetary history.

"I can't just read a bunch of textbooks and hope someone out there will hire me"
That's exactly what you're doing going to school
Who said hands on experience is only possible at school? Who said you need school to pursue higher education or to have connections in a field?
You can go to school your whole life but a governed mind won't make it far

You could do that just as easy by doing your own research and spending a lot less money. Also after getting an education then trying to get a job afterwords proves harder than many students are led to beleive. Any profession ties you down with time. What it's all about is time freedom. Money doesn't matter, time does

Going to be a bumpy ride but worth holding on

Yeah, I believe you are right. Most conspiracy theorists run across Alex Jones from the very beginning with their research. It seems as if they have it designed that way to put you in limbo mode and throw a wrench into your research by making you discredit it immediately because it sounds to absurd. If he was a real threat they'd just take him out, plain and simple.
