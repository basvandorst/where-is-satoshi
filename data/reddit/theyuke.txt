If rejected, we may see triple digits again.
The reason for the current run is the false idea that the longer the SEC waits, the more likely the ETF will be approved.  This run is increasing the losses of a rejection and reducing the gains of an approval.

"Customer".  Yes, you are buying services of the miners, but eventually the miners will run out of customers if this keeps up.
"Your money's no good here" has taken on a whole new meaning.  When the miners can force higher fees, making Bitcoin worth doing in only large transactions, then it is time to find a coin more accommodating.
The miners are turning Bitcoin into Netscape.

I have been using a .29% daily return projection (historical average since gdax). With the halvening reducing the rate of inflation by 4%, the daily return increased to .301%.
The best way I have found to use this chart has been to sell half at +10% difference and buy at -5% difference. For this past year, I bought in at 436.73, on 5-19, sold at 570.47 on 6-3, bought in again at 552.82 on 8-2-16, sold at 1041.87 last night, bought in at 899 today. This increased my Bitcoin amount by just over 10%.

Because ETH.  If you sell and there is a fork, you no longer have coin for either blockchain.  If you hold, you have coin for both the more dominant and lesser chains.
Bitcoin will survive a fork.  The question is will it survive the alt coins making a run until the fork.

Bitcoin is going to go up.  It just barely got overpriced in this last bull run.  The Euro will go down.  Italy is just one more event, not the end.  The ETF will buy more Bitcoin as more invest, driving price up.
Short answer is buying now is a better bet than buying a month from now.  It will never go below £800 after January.

I did that.  Matter of fact, one of the E-mail sent came directly from VLAD at support.  Guessing that is you.
"We have confirmed this to be an issue with our system and are working to resolve it as soon as possible. Your case has been escalated to an expert who will keep you informed.
Meanwhile, the BTC have been returned to your account and, if you wish, you should be able to initiate a sell again.
Thank you for your patience in the meantime — we will be in touch again as soon as we have an update.

That "expert" then stated the receipt I have of the completed transaction was "the order confirmation is a chance to double check the details of your order, it does not serve as a contract or guarantee.
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Warm regards,

However the E-mail I originally received stated it was completed and the funds were transferred, all past tense.  Add in the fact that transfers to the USD WALLET ARE INSTANT, then there is no way to "double check."

I have it as 7% overvalued coming out of an undervalued trend.  The overvaluing trend should peak on January 15 at $1280. Usually an overvaluing period lasts about 60 days.   The real value increases by about .00297% per day.  I expect the real value to match the price of about $1100 by the end of February after this small bubble bursts about the end of January.  Towards the end of March it will still be around $1100 with a real value of about $1200.  This will be the best time to buy other than RIGHT NOW!
TLDR; price drops start end of January, but never below $1100.

Bitcoin as a currency requires a paradigm shift.  Pricing will not be dictated by cost + profit + competiton, but cost + valuation expectation + competition.
Say the going rate for a good (say a 1997 Camaro with 150,000) is $4,000.  The profit I expect is a 10% markup, so it is $4,400.  The comparison sell similar Camaros at $4,200.  My cost remains the same, so to compete, I have to lower profit.  Now, let's say we use BTC instead.  Say current exchange rate is $1,000.  The old paradigm would be you need to charge 4.2 BTC.  However there is a valuation expectation.  If I need that value immediately, then I still need to charge 4.2 BTC.  If I expect BTC to double in value in a year, then I break even in a year's time charging 2.1 BTC.  The competition will price goods according to how long they can hold Bitcoin and not need to cash it × their BTC value growth expectation.  Say they did not change their paradigm yet and continue to charge at current exchange rates.  I then know I need $4,400 but not until 6 months from now.  I can afford to charge 3 BTC with my expected growth rate.
The pricing of goods will become dependent on long term growth rate expectations.

I have it peaking around $1280 on January 15, then dropping to the $1050 range by the end of the month.  Still looking at $2700 by end of year, so go ahead and do that weak handed stuff.  I will hold as I know I could be underestimating it.

When it hits 177.28 on January 14, 2015, I was showing it as overvalued by 54%.  Bitcoin should not have hit $200 until 7/26/15 going by the rate of growth over the last four years.
@_date: 2016-12-31 09:50:16
The only three times I have seen a 6% overvaluation coming out of an undervaluation trend, we peaked at 97%, 30%, and 33% respectively.  We hit 6% on 12-27.  All three times, we crossed the 30% barrier within 3 weeks.  That puts Bitcoin at 1275 between January 10th and 20th.  My model shows it coming back down towards the end of January, but we'll never see triple digits again.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:47:52
Didn't think about that.  Say I think there is a 1% chance it hits 150,000 and a 50% chance it hits 2500, the 150,000 is still the best way to go, plus if I'm off by 5%, I still have a chance.  If I'm off by 5% on the 2500, I probably lose.
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:07:05
I think once we hit $1,000, we'll see a price correction to $940 and possibly a triggered panic sell down to $880.  At that point, I am overinvesting.  Buy when people are scared, sell when people are comfortable.

There is no Bitcoin industry.  Bitcoin does not care about nor need mass adoption.
People care about motivations.  They care about emotion.  Reason doesn't matter.  You can convince their mind that Bitcoin is good and they still won't adopt it because the heart is not convinced.  We want everyone to adopt Bitcoin.  Why?  Because banks.  Because fees.  Because profit.  That hasn't given them a reason.  You want me to use Bitcoin so your value increases is not a reason.
Change is uncomfortable.  The motivation for change must be worth more than the discomfort of changing.  Profit is a poor motivator for most people.

Price doubles if supply is cut in half and demand remains constant.
The halvening cuts the inflation rate, not the supply.  Kinda like Democrats saying they cut spending by only increasing it by 5% rather than the 15% they originally pushed for.  
Bitcoin in the last four years has gone up about an average of 9.1% a month with massive volatility.  Since the last halvening, it has been 9.4% per month.  This is caused by demand increasing more than a cut in inflation.
