How is it at all reasonable that some company goes and hires most the bitcoin core devs?  Isn't this an inside attack on bitcoin?  Isn't that a scandal?  Isn't this entire "debate" now a result of that?

The market decides, not users.  The more people that use bitcoin the bigger the blocks get (and the more valuable bitcoin becomes).  Somehow I doubt users are against bitcoin becoming more valuable.

Agree. The blockstream group is trying to frame this debate in a particularly disagreeable way. And they're too scared to let bitcoin scale or to let a fork happen (because they know their fork won't be the fork to survive). Every day they post more of the same drivel hoping something sticks. It's annoying as hell. They are the ones trying to change bitcoin. They are the ones trying to put one over on everyone else.
We get it. You want bitcoin to not scale so your system will have to be used. Stop trying to bullshit us. Stop trying to frame the discussion like just letting bitcoin scale how it was always supposed to is some big change. You keep getting downvoted because everyone sees through the bullshit.  Let it go.

You are repeating bullshit that is being fed to the less technically savvy.  Bitcoin can continue to grow just fine just as it has since it started.  The cap didn't do anything, it was just a limit that only now is starting to get hit.  The "evidence and arguments" for not raising the block size are about a group trying to cripple bitcoin to benefit their own side projects. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:19:00
I went to post the same thing. This sort of complexity is not needed at this time. We're talking about removing a temporary spam cap that was always meant to be removed. There is no real technical debate or worry, just nonsense stalling from a few who have alternative systems they want to push and the block size is a convenient tool to do so.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:11:11
You can stop saying that if you don't control the private key you don't own the bitcoin...  but it remains true.  Technology, its cost, and its ease of use will improve--and the bitcoin doors will open for the average joe without needing to disable or avoid what makes bitcoin unique.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:42:22
You won't have to worry about 20 MB blocks until a long time from now when network and storage technologies have advanced and unless bitcoin is very successful. If it happens it will be a nice position for bitcoin to have achieved. And in the meantime nothing stops other technologies from being developed along the way. 
The problem is this particular debate is centered around pushing a new technology at the expense of bitcoin and what bitcoin was always meant to be--it's not really about what it claims to be about. Those pushing for keeping bitcoin limited don't even have the balls to argue what they are really trying to do doing plainly. Right now most of us don't want bitcoin to remain limited for the purpose of being a special purpose clearing system for some other technology (that doesn't even exist yet). Let other technologies be developed and prove themselves on their own merits. In the meantime bitcoin is on its own growth path. Don't fuck with that growth path--a lot of people have put a lot of faith and money into that path for years, not for some vaporware idea a couple devs are pushing.

You are probably clueless but fiat is in the process of falling apart world wide. Rates are negative, banks are being run in many places hyperinflation exists in others. Debt has reached a saturation point even in the best places (e.g. usa).

The incentives you mention, though real, are not sufficient as can be observed from the currently falling node count despite block size still being small.  Obviously keeping block size small will not reverse the situation (nor probably even slow it) as it is having no effect now.  In short the general public doesn't care about those incentives (making them not actually incentives).  You actually have to have incentives the public cares about if you expect them to work.  Open your eyes, this is all common sense conclusion from what we can observe currently.
I have mined in the past, I don't mine anymore as it doesn't make economic sense.  I've also ran a node in the past and (usually) don't anymore as it doesn't make sense from an effort/cost perspective (even now with the block size cap).  Nothing you say has any relevance at all.  What is relevant is not removing the cap will severely damage bitcoin and there is no rational alternative.
Your last paragraph is a complete non sequitur.  People responsible for working on and adding to bitcoin have been working on competing systems practically from the beginning.  So what do I think the result would be?  Look around.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:49:02

Get used to it, it's going to get worse.  Centralized agents like Coinbase will remain targets of regulation and in the end won't look any different than banks.  They will cancel accounts, freeze funds, demand info on payments and income, etc., etc.
If you care about financial freedom you can't use services like Coinbase.  At least bitcoin makes that possible.

The issue isn't exactly how market demand goes. One issue is do you accept the market is in control or are you the sort who thinks they can predict and/or control the market? The more important issue is what is the point? What are you even achieving by capping block size? Is it bitcoin that needs it or is it just your mind that is obsessed with control? Some people might as well stick with fiat and all the men who think they can and need to control the money supply, market, etc....

Bitcoin has a way of throwing most people off and into bad ideas just at the worst times.  People get burned in scams, mtgox, altcoins, you name it.  This cripplecoin is just the latest distraction that will end up costing a big group of people a lot (in missed opportunity if nothing else).  Again I think price is about to make a big move that will again clarify focus as it separates the winners from the losers.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:11:59
The podcast linked argues that that is likely the goal of the devs who are holding this logjam in place and refusing to let bitcoin scale up.  They are trying to force people out of bitcoin and into other systems.  
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:08:30
My objection is the current cap is the odd thing--it was only added as a temp measure for spam control.  Now they won't put bitcoin back how it was...  somehow a temporary cap has taken on a larger significance than was ever in satoshi's design.

Tyrannical but perhaps necessary given the direction certain devs are taking to undermine bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:26:14
I think Gavin is one of the few who is honestly pushing for what bitcoin was always meant to be. Some of the other devs have decided, for whatever reasons, to go in a new direction. The means of the new direction are obviously very different from bitcoin's original means but even the ends of the direction are different though more subtly. There is nothing wrong with going with new technologies and to have new goals... try them and see if they work and the market accepts them. But don't constrain or destroy the original concept and goals in the process, especially when it's the leading concept. It doesn't get more irresponsible than that.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:26:58
This is disgusting watching the blockstream group parade bad argument after bad argument trying to make the simple scaling of bitcoin appear as the extreme case rather than their own position of neutering bitcoin.

There is no proposal for letting bitcoin scale that will appease the "critics" because those people don't want bitcoin to scale, period. They have alternative systems they are pushing and limiting bitcoin is to their advantage and their goal. You can't compromise with someone who wants bitcoin stopped. You shouldn't even be bothering to bring them into the discussion. 
Hasn't anyone even noticed the lack of buttcoin trolls lately? All this "cap bitcoin" nonsense IS the trolling. People with an incentive to stop bitcoin's growth are making a power grab and I'm shocked at the platform they are getting here. We're past the laughing at us stage and into they fighting us stage and it's such a subtle way to attack bitcoin apparently some here don't even recognize it.
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:27:20
Maybe devs should focus more on consensus for scaling bitcoin itself and less on alternative projects. Or there will be a fork and Gavin and Mike will have control as you state. It's not like Gavin hasn't been trying.

@_date: 2015-06-23 13:49:23
Exactly. There is no debate, bitcoin was always meant to scale. Increasing a cap doesn't make blocks larger, increased usage makes blocks larger--and isn't a lot of usage a nice "problem" for bitcoin to have! It's been the entire point since bitcoin started. 
This is a power grab, an attempt to keep bitcoin from growing, increasing its fees and pushing value out of bitcoin and into alternative systems. If these other systems are so great they should be able to compete on their own merits. 
Increase the cap and let bitcoin continue taking over the world. If there is no consensus from the blockstream folks then they are the ones trying to limit bitcoin by force for their own benefit. Either take them out of the debate or fork the code. Either way the value will follow bitcoin as it was originally intended because that's what this has always been about. Blockstream doesn't get to force everyone out of bitcoin into their system (which doesn't even exist yet), they can compete for the market like every other idea and win or lose on merit. Ironically if they are actually right they will take transactions off the bitcoin network and it will stop growing on its own. So let's see that happen on merit, by market choice, not by force and power grab.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:28:21

@_date: 2015-06-19 14:01:29
Everything he's been doing for a while now from not letting the block size cap go away to now this bullshit is damaging bitcoin and on purpose. Problems need to be discussed and solutions made that benefit the system, you don't cause the network to fail to push people into your side projects! Can't you see the difference between constructive ways to build bitcoin and destructive ways that try to move people away from bitcoin and into something else? If he wants to make an altcoin or other network let him, but stop letting him undermine bitcoin itself! 
He causes this non-debate about block size by not letting the block size cap be removed then he starts exploiting the problems leaving the cap is causing! How is this not being stopped? Where the fuck is Gavin and any leadership for bitcoin? This is bullshit!
The guy has conflicts of interest and has shown he wants to damage bitcoin to prove a point--he should not be a dev.

Good thing your impression constrains transaction growth or we could be in trouble.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:23:37
If it comes to a "contentious hard-fork" it is due to some devs wanting to cripple bitcoin for the benefit of alternative systems, not because of any technical issue with bitcoin. That is the sort of contention that must be faced and sorted out (the earlier the better) or it will just rise up again on the next excuse they find.
*This is a political battle between devs, not a technical problem.* It will likely be solved with a political solution like a fork or removing contentious devs, not with a complex technical hack.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:33:33
Do you realize it's EASIER right now for a threat to attack bitcoin with this cap in place? It doesn't take much to spam the network up to the cap and start delaying all transactions and filling up the mempool of waiting transactions and otherwise making bitcoin inoperable. You have to raise the cap to make it more difficult to attack. Having a cap doesn't really DO anything to stop attacks.

I wish the bozos who write these stories would draw a better distinction between bitcoin's price drop and the other examples, e.g. Russian currency and oil price declines.   Bitcoin *retraced* after a HUGE price surge.  It's still higher than it was before the price surge.  By many measures bitcoin is UP.  The other examples given are down, period.
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:54:19
I think you're under a delusion that the blockstream devs want to compromise and are willing to raise the cap.  What if they don't want to raise the limit because it helps blockstream and nothing anyone says will change that?  That's what I think is happening.  In that case blockstream is trying to take over bitcoin using the devs it has bought.  THAT is the coup that must be stopped by using bitcoinxt.

I don't have a problem with that sort of cap.  That sort of block size assurance for nodes and miners should be WELL away from the typical block size.  Which means this cap should've been removed a year ago at least.  But that's not what has happened...  they are not agreeing to raise the cap because it's not that sort of cap--they want the cap to remain as it cripples bitcoin and will push value into alternative systems.
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:22:46
Why?  What does an arbitrarily selected cap specification "doubling every 4 years" have anything to do with anything?  Do you think the bitcoin market growth has to match some arbitrary cap limit someone invented from thin air?  And what is it about actually lifting the cap or moving it significantly higher that is so frightening to some people?  A higher cap doesn't make blocks become larger, the bitcoin market decides that.  And if the market grows faster than expected why that a bad thing that needs to be capped?  If a cap is installed and not hit then why was it needed?  If a cap is installed and bitcoin growth causes it to be hit (and jams up the system as we've seen) then it would have to be removed, wasn't very well conceived in the first place, and shouldn't have been there.
In other words why have any arbitrary cap at all?  A cap should only exist if it is based on actual hard limitations of the protocol/technology.  The current cap was a temporary limit put in during the very early years of bitcoin when it was still very young and all the issues not well understood.  We are past that point now and don't need that sort of cap anymore.

I've been a constant voice against trading, exchanges, and letting others control your private keys from the moment I became a bitcoin supporter.  I usually get downvoted for voicing such opinions  though so maybe it's no surprise you think those voices were negligible.

The talk of the fork is more of a problem than just doing it.  Doing it sorts things out very quickly and it no longer is contentious regardless the outcome.

How many blocks do you think have been capped over the last few years and what point did that actually serve?  What does the cap actually DO?  What is wrong with miners capping the size if they think they need to or if there is some sort of temporary spam issue?  Why limit the protocol itself when actual usage hitting the cap causes bitcoin to break down?  Because now it's being pointed out that blocks being capped are starting to cause problems because genuine usage is reaching the cap.  What good is a cap that has to be removed when it actually starts being hit?

I agree.  And I think nodes have plenty of incentive, just not at the level of individuals.  But not if bitcoin doesn't scale.  If bitcoin isn't going to scale everyone might as well sell their coins now.
If electrum servers are shit and have problems with larger blocks that should be fixed independently of the block size discussion.  Toy solutions will have to be upgraded as bitcoin grows up.

No, I don't expect a block size increase to do anything to the market.  I expect the market will do what it does.  However the restrictions added to bitcoin early on need to be removed as it is long past the time those restrictions were needed and we're bumping against those limits.
What I don't understand is why anyone is interested in capping bitcoin.  Why have a cap?  If the cap is hit bitcoin will fall apart and the cap would have to be removed, so why have it?

Those in favor of capping bitcoin's growth are the ones against the fork. This is because they fear the market will quickly choose Gavin's direction (which it will) and they will lose their shot at capping bitcoin and forcing eveyone into their alternative systems.

Wow, the bullshit that comes from the small block camp.  There is a crisis and it's being caused by guys like this.  This is not some "knife stab", this is letting bitcoin scale as it was always intended.  Misrepresenting the natural scaling of bitcoin that was always meant to happen as if it were some problem is the real evil.  The destructive element is those that would hold bitcoin to a tiny block size to force fees to raise (presuming that's even what happens which I highly doubt) and value to flow into alternative systems.  This is quite simply an attack on bitcoin--an attempt to take value away from the main system into competing systems.  The big difference with this attack is it is coming from the inside--from a number of devs who want bitcoin to turn into something else (for the benefit of their own side projects).  This is despicable.
I can't believe the orchestrated number of FUD articles being pushed by those that would destroy bitcoin for their own benefit.  And of course they do it in places like reddit where the average user isn't technically aware enough to tell its total bullshit.  It's like buttcoin suddenly flooded the sub is getting its crap articles upvoted.

Making running a full node easier will increase the number of nodes but not by that much.  If there is no incentive to run a node (like there was with mining), most people won't do it.  A big reason why the nodes all vanished is mining became something only pros could do.
I understand 21 Inc was looking at making consumer products that mine small amounts of bitcoin.  I dunno if that is still happening but that is incentive.

Or maybe we just get rid of any pointless caps that were put in a long time back for potential spam reasons when bitcoin was young and now has no real use anymore?  If miners want to limit the size of their blocks they are free to do so.  The bitcoin protocol itself has no need for caps that have little real world function and simply have to be removed the moment market demand actually drives block size near the cap.

I'm all for developing a fee market..  in a decade or two when bitcoin has matured enough to support it.  A fee market is an entirely independent discussion however.  In the meantime bitcoin will fail if it doesn't scale up, period.
But then you've no doubt heard all this before and still want bitcoin to not scale.  So I presume you are either an idiot or have ulterior motives where you want bitcoin's value to be transferred to some other system.  Either way I don't see the point in talking to people like you.  The scaling measure should be done with or without consensus as consensus cannot be reached due to the conflicts of interests of many of the devs.

The whole debate is nonsense.  The current block size limit was a temporary spam limit put in place when bitcoin was young and a lot of issues were not known.  Today any limit beyond limits related to the technical limits of bitcoin is no longer needed.  Any limit put in place only has to be removed if it is actually hit just like today's limit, so what is the  point?  The limit doesn't DO anything except give those that would try to undermine bitcoin leverage to work with.

The fork is not Satoshi's fault or the fault of Gavin. The fork is being forced by a few who want to control bitcoin and change its course. They are fully to blame.  But really it's not that big a deal--you are being overly (falsely?) dramatic, just like those that might make the fork happen. If it comes to a fork the billions in bitcoin will rapidly side with bitcoin's original goals. The real users and holders of bitcoin's value are not worried and not confused, despite all the efforts of those that are trying to muddy the waters. If that wasn't the case price would be collapsing already.

Nothing that you say is relevant.  Node usage has no incentives at the level of individuals so it will not increase there, period.  If you don't give individuals an incentive for running nodes that will not change.  Keeping block size small fixes nothing.  It just keeps bitcoin at the level of a toy and IMO will rapidly make it pointless and replaced by something that will scale.
Anyone with eyes could see where bitcoin was headed the moment personal mining become impractical.  If you expected bitcoin to remain some fully P2P based system where everyone runs a node you must be thinking of some other system other than bitcoin that incentives such a thing.  So go work on that system (whatever it is) and leave bitcoin to grow into what it was always going to be.

Even just buying coins from them might be a future problem. They are reporting your purchases to government and nobody has any idea what that might mean as time goes by. You could be told to give up your coins, told to account for all coin you withdrew and where they went, be assigned a special tax, be audited by the IRS, be put on a terrorist watch list, who knows.
The addresses Coinbase used to get your coins to you are known. It might be a crime in the future to have done any number of things with coins at thise addresses today... like exchanging them at shapeshifter, sending them to a tumbler or otherwise trying to obscure ownership, gambling with them, sending overseas, whatever. You have no idea what might happen later, all you know is they know. They could even come after you for something someone else did with coin that were originally sent to you that you passed on but that they decide from their systems was really you. And then you have to prove you didn't have control of the coins and good luck with that.
I actually expect some future surprise...  and it won't be a good surprise. Coins from Coinbase are of a very different sort than coin from other places. They have risks you can't even account for right now. I wouldn't even use coinbase for coin purchases unless you intend to merely hold them and eventually sell them back to coinbase with proper tax payments.

WTF are you talking about?  You have it exactly backwards.  It's much easier for an attacker to damage bitcoin NOW...  it takes hardly any spam transactions to ram bitcoin against its current 1MB cap and cause transactions to jam up.  You can bet if they don't remove the cap that's exactly what will happen to; all the talk of developing a "fee market" is utter nonsense on a system that will simply fail to function properly.  
Once the cap is gone bitcoin can simply take whatever is thrown at it--nobody could afford to jam it up.  Bitcoin is no longer a baby, it doesn't need a 1MB spam cap.  Heck it's nearly hitting the 1MB cap with genuine transactions!

@_date: 2015-06-17 21:20:24
It's not the miners or the protocol that decide block size, it's market demand for bitcoin transactions.  If demand raises block size up to 8MB before expected then this cap just has to be moved up and we go through this nonsense again.  What good is a cap that doesn't really DO anything and just has to move when it's reached?  Why is there a cap at all?  Miners can mine a smaller block size if they wish, it doesn't require a cap on the protocol.  Meanwhile some miners desire for block size to remain small has no bearing on what the market actually does, so why does it matter what they might want?
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:04:45
That is irrelevant.  Nobody is trying to solve the internet of things with this block size increase right now.  We're trying to keep bitcoin working.  Devs with solutions to scaling for the internet of things can do so as they wish with whatever systems they wish, but bitcoin must scale NOW regardless.  Nothing stops people from adopting some level 2 on bitcoin that can handle the internet of things later...  but if bitcoin doesn't scale now there won't be a bitcoin to add a level 2 on!
However some people are using the point you make as an excuse to NOT scale bitcoin in order to cripple bitcoin to force value from bitcoin into other systems.  Stop helping them.  It's a bullshit argument, stop spreading it.

IMO block size increase will increase the number of nodes. This will be due to further adoption, more professional bitcoin interest adding support for the nextwork, etc. This adoption will not happen if bitcoin is not allowed to scale and node count will continue to decline (along with everything else bitcoin related).
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:52:52

Price is a reflection of demand. Price can go up because of few people with a lot of demand as you point out, or price can go up because of many people with smaller demand. But either way price will be higher when there is more adoption, that's all I'm saying. There will not be signifantly more adoption to the point where many people are regularly using bitcoin in stores and yet price is at todays levels.

I agree the debate is mostly noise and nonsense. There is so much misdirection and sheer BS. I think it will get sorted out quickly when bitcoin starts to move in price again.

Gox has obviously been short of money since the US government confiscated millions from that account that was shut down last year.  Who knows what they've been doing to keep running since then but at some point the last people to get out will be the ones without cash or bitcoin.

8MB just means we come back and do this all again next year. Anyone in favor of constraining bitcoin at these low usage rates is not a friend of bitcoin. They are trying to constrain bitcoin to force value into some alternative system. These people are so laughably wrong on this matter that when the 1MB cap is lifted (as it must be) they should lose all credibility and not be listened to when the same problem comes up again when 8MB blocks are getting full.

Node count has been dropping as personal mining has been disappearing and going pro and as SPV wallets have appeared and become better.  It's not a mystery--there is now little incentive or reason for an individual to run a node.  This has nothing to do with block size and everything to do with what mining has become and the increase in SPV wallets.
My "theory" in the previous comment above is based on the thinking that node usage will again pick up when bitcoin is allowed to properly scale and the later growth that comes.  However those nodes will likely be run by institutions interested in maintaining bitcoin and by pro miners, not by individuals.  The increase will come from the increase in the number of institutions that have a financial interest in bitcoin as bitcoin expands.  Individuals have no incentives to run a node, that time has passed.  However there could be nodes run by newly developed technologies by companies like 21 inc that focus on increasing node usage by ordinary people, that is yet to be seen.  However none of this will happen if bitcoin is not allowed to scale up.  
Keeping the block size small will not increase node usage, it will destroy bitcoin.   Those that think the block size should stay small are either idiots or have ulterior motives that desire to chase usage away from bitcoin into other services.

Even if that were true, which it's not, you can't "spam limit" to the point blocks get full on a regular basis. Bitcoin falls apart. Caps don't work, they just cause problems when they are reached. Miners can limit block size and spam as they see fit, the protocol itself is not the place for caps.

Big things are happening in gold right now so they are bringing out all the talking heads they can to trash gold. 
If you were unaware, gold is in backwardation and getting deeper backwardated every day. If you thought spot price was the way to judge gold, think again. Gold spot price is not a measure of the price of gold, it's a measure of the price of gold derivatives which at rare times cannot actually value real physical gold.  Backwardation is another indication to watch and means stress in the system of gold derivatives vs real gold.  Backwardation is a very rare thing for gold and means large holders of physical gold are currently unwilling to swap out their gold at a "risk free" profit for gold derivatives... they are worried the futures system can't currently be trusted to get their physical gold back to them. Periods of backwardation are historically very short and during some significant  crisis (e.g. Lehman Brother's collapse). That we are now in the longest period of backwardation on record (and it just keeps getting more backwardated)  is ominous. 
You might think of backwardation as an event similar to everyone pulling bitcoin out of centralized exchanges and holding them in paper wallets themselves, to the point where people won't even take a deposit bonus to deposit bitcoins.  And consider that centralized exchanges are where we get bitcoin price, so what does price even mean when people pull bitcoin from the place where price is set?  Such a thing would only happen when trust in the centralized systems is failing.  It's the same for both for bitcoin and gold, but in the case of gold you're talking about the defacto basis of the entire world monetary system--this is no small issue.
**This is literally the most important financial issue happening right now IMO and almost nobody knows it's happening or what it is**. It's related to the possible collapse of the fiat system (which will be preceeded by gold going into permanent backwardation; gold spot price will be irrelevant).
[Read more on this issue here](
You can see a long term chart of this using gold forwards at this link. Backwardation is basically when the line drops below zero. Notice we've been in a near crisis state since the 2008 mess (and going in and out of backwardation since late 2013) and in the last few weeks have started a plunge consistently below zero and to lows not seen in over a decade. And we're still dropping. Click on "6M" to see the 6 month view which makes the recent move below zero since October clear.

They are observing how the order book changes to their order to try to determine demand/liquidity at various prices (among other goals).  Wall Street exchanges are full of that sort of crap now even though it's technically illegal to place an order you have no intention of actually executing just to cancel it a microsecond later.  Google high frquency trading (HFT) for more.
Expect it to get significantly worse as bitcoin matures.  Soon the majority of the order book might be robots that drop and move orders instantly in response to other orders... the false liquidity makes it annoying as hell for a human trying to place an order.

I don't think it's priced in yet. But one thing is sure, I don't trust anyone in the bitcoin world that doesn't have significant exposure to bitcoin and is driven by that exposure. I don't trust the blockstream devs precisely because they seem to be driven by desire to build something new (akin to someone starting an altcoin) and not enough desire to make bitcoin itself a success. I can't say for sure they actually want to destroy bitcoin for the sake of something else, but it's seems a distinct possibility.

True, though cc users get perks like insurance on purchases, buyer protection, reward points, etc. that are arguably worth a higher cost (and are subsidized by the cash buyers). The question is why does anyone pay cash if they don't have to, or why don't merchants discount cash to incentivize it if it costs them less.  Bitcoin has this issue as well, most people won't spend their bitcoin over credit cards unless merchants offer discounts.

That's the genius of the trick...  slow bleed and very few people even realize how much is being taken from everyone.  
And that's with government supplied inflation numbers which are no doubt conservative.  By other measures its worse.  For example, minimum wage in 1964 (the last year of silver coinage) was $1.25.  But the silver alone in $1.25 of change from 1964 is worth nearly $18 today.  Today's supposedly inflation adjusted minimum wage isn't even half of that!  That's partly why it only took a single worker to support a family back then and now it takes both parents working (+ credit card debt).

Fractional reserve lending isn't likely to happen with bitcoin for several reasons.  First off banks aren't required with bitcoin as you can mange bitcoin yourself so there often won't be an institution to do the fractional lending for many people.  Secondly, institutions that hold bitcoin (e.g. coinbase) will have pressure to provide audits via the blockchain for their holdings and that doesn't work with fractional reserve.  Thirdly, as bitcoin can't be endlessly replicated like dollars and can be tracked via the blockchain lending will have to be honest and up-front, not hidden via fractional reserve--you'll know when your bitcoins are lent out and you'll agree to it.  And lastly there won't be much reason anyone will allow their coins to be fractionally lent out because as bitcoin is not an inflating asset there is no pressure to take a risk loaning it out to get a small interest income from it.  You simply won't put your coins in an institution that lends them out unless you're willing to take that risk...  and as long as you KNOW you coins are lent out and are not available to you on demand then it's NOT fractional reserve lending, it's simply lending (and there's nothing wrong with lending when everyone knows what's happening).

The country went into a tailspin due to too much bad lending which was associated with how the dollar is debt based and created almost without limit by the banking system and made worse by regulation changes allow banks even more freedom to lend.  Bitcoin is the solution to this as it is not debt-based. If we require institutions like coinbase to be full reserve and prove they have our bitcoins via the blockchain the system CAN'T do what they did and it won't require any regulation at all beyond the blockchain.  I wish people in this forum at least understood the POINT of bitcoin which is to replace trust in central authority and regulation by a coded design that doesn't need them.

It won't take long to exhaust sellers at $300.  Then price will drop.  The correct way to sell a big block is off exchange via a big block broker.

Some like the euro and chinese fiat didn't exist 20 years ago. The others haven't been fiat for long. Like the dollar most of them were based on gold just a few decades ago. In short they are young... and the list of the failures keep growing every year. Russia, Iceland, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Peru, Chile, Yugoslavia, etc. It's easy to find failed fiat currencies, what is difficult is finding a fiat that has lasted more than 50 years. Pick a country and read the history of its currency... you'll find time after time when a fiat currency is introduced it fails or significantly changes in a few decades.

It was clear mtgox was running fractional reserve at a minimum back in may 2013 after it came out millions were confiscated by the US government associated with Dwolla and wells fargo.  I and many others said to get out immediately so you're not one of the last left trying to get their funds back from the government.  Few listened. If they had gox would've fallen much sooner,  many more people would've saved their funds (though not all as you point out),  blaming transaction malleablity never would have happened, etc.
Long before that I've been telling people bitcoin exchanges have a horrible track record and if you don't control your own private keys you don't own the bitcoin. In my view anyone letting someone else hold their private key should accept they are taking a significant risk and should not do that unless they are willing to lose the funds. I say that now as well. It is your fault if you give up your keys and your coins are lost, stolen, confiscated, or whatever. Period. Take personal responsibility for your property, bitcoin actually gives you the tools to do so.

Besides, bitcoin users go out of their way to find places to use bitcoin (and get discounts), so they are getting new traffic.

Just because you work in the company doesn't make it not a risky venture.  Tons of similar companies didn't make it from that era.  It's easy with hindsight to say msft wasn't a risky asset, but it was and always has been. Gates took a huge risk and it massively paid off. The same goes for nearly anyone who has made large amounts of wealth.
As for bitcoin yes it's risky but it also has great promise. I'm with the OP. The promise of bitcoin is huge,  it is fulfilling it's promise so far, it's still small and misunderstood...  the potential rewards are great.

This is related to what is now coming out about mainstream forex trading in the news.  You've got these derivatives traders and they buy/sell futures...  **the other side of that derivative trade is often the brokerage/exchange itself--this is a massive conflict of interest.**  This time it's led to an exchange taking gains away from traders directly, but that's because this is an unsophisticated exchange.  What happens at the next level is the exchange, which has full knowledge of all trader positions, their stops, margin and equity levels, etc. FORCES traders into stops and margin calls by slamming the market down.  
Anyone that talks about how great it is having "modern" instruments like futures and other derivatives in bitcoin doesn't understand what really goes on with these things.  This is how markets are rigged people.  If you trade these derivatives on these markets you are looking to get sheared (and the rest of us who don't trade derivatives still have to deal with the nonsense that hits the bitcoin price from that bullshit part of the market).  
Avoid this nonsense.  Buy actual bitcoin.  Hold it off of exchanges where you control the private key.

Deflation isn't the problem.  It's the response to deflation from government that causes problems with fiat.  I'm hedging against the inevitable effects of bad government policy to deflation with a deflationary currency that cannot be abused like the dollar can.
As for the US dollar, it's already lost 85% of its value in my lifetime alone according to government numbers which are conservative (and that's while it wasn't being printed at out-of-control rates).

You can't stop people from doing it but it might not be a good idea (again, MtGox).

Every failed currency in history has had intelligent people at the helm trying to avoid failure and the failure happened anyway.  This is because the situation that leads to failure is a trap with no good alternatives.  Do you think the US WANTS to be printing right now?  No, they started it because it was what they thought was the best option.  And now we're walking the exact same path as dozens of other modern day currency failures.  We are forced down a road where the end result is known for anyone with a bit of knowledge of history.

The issue is what the faith rests in.  In the case of gold/bitcoin, faith rests in the natural properties of an asset to continue being useful to the market (as money) into the future and thus derive value.  This is a reasonable conclusion drawn on observation of history, the market, the asset, etc.  In the case of gold this well founded faith has held strong without falter for literally for thousands of years.  This is because gold and its properties do not change and neither do the general needs of markets.  Over time gold remains useful as money to man and thus man values it. Hopefully bitcoin will be similar as it was modeled after gold but we'll have to see.
In the case of fiat, faith rests in the government, central bank, etc. to properly manage their paper money, remain fair, as well as remain in power.  In this case observation of history shows holding such faith in governments/banks to maintain their currency is only a good bet for relatively short periods of time while things are working well.  The result has been a long history where no fiat currency has lasted more than a handful of decades.  Governments themselves tend to not last that long and usually take their currencies with them when they are replaced.
Now you might call both of those cases "faith based," but to suggest they are at all similar is absurd.

Absolutely I agree--I know there were good reasons for printing.  That's why fiat doesn't last very long: there are always issues that arise with very good reasons for doing what leads to fiat failure and other options are few and too politically difficult.

We are. The video creator is very confused and ignorant about money and its history. He seems to think all money is debt based, but bitcoin isn't debt based (and neither were most historical monies). Bitcoin is mined into existence like gold not borrowed into existence like dollars. The mammoth-money example makes no sense... how does having people give you rocks/tokens track who owes you? You end up with a pile of rocks not a ledger of who owes you what. And why would anyone later accept those rocks as tokens of value?  That's not how money works regardless if it is debt-based or asset-based--the video creator should educate himself on a subject before he tries to educate others.
If you want to know about the history of asset based money read about barter, gold, etc. (the author seems to think this sort of money doesn't exist, but it was the most common form).  If you want to know about ancient debt-based money (which I think this guy is trying to explain), google tally sticks.

With dollars there is little downside to fractional reserve.  Dollars are already debt instruments with default risk, depreciating, controlled by government, etc. The government protects against systematic risk of dollar system implosion (if you believe them anyway). But bitcoin are assets not debts. And they are assets with unique global money properties you can't get elsewhere. Why would someone give that up to hold risky bitcoin debt? Just use dollars if you want that.  If someone creates bitcoin debt it won't be on the blockchain, you won't be able to transfer it anywhere in the world instantly, it won't be private,  it will have default risk, etc.--in short it won't be bitcoin.

I think it's a very good time to buy physical gold and avoid derivatives. It's also a good time to not put much stock into gold spot prices. They might continue down but that doesn't mean anyone trying to buy size can reliably buy large amounts of physical at the spot price.  What good is a low dollar price for an asset that can't actually be bought for dollars? What does it matter if that price goes lower? Small buyers shouldn't have problems buying or selling coins near spot price unless things get really bad.  
To be clear this is the most recent development of a longer term thing.  We've been in a near critical state since 2008.  I'm not saying something happens immediately, it might just recover, but the warning flashers are on.

Think of the difference in these kinds of discussions once bitcoin is more mainstream and simply staying in bitcoin is a decent choice. There would be no discussion, the best thing to do is simply move your money to bitcoin and leave it there, period. No hassles about converting it back to anything with associated banks and fees. No discussion about  fiat at all beyond how to best turn it into bitcoin.  Now imagine that happening world wide--hyper-monetization of bitcoin globally. It's coming, it's just a matter of time.

I think the post on the main page about moving money out of China gives one example of what might cause people to move into bitcoin without requiring a fiat failure.  It's certainly a lot easier and cheaper to simply move into bitcoin from a foreign fiat currency than it is to move from fiat to bitcoin and then back to fiat.  The remittance market is similar.
As for what happens to other currencies as bitcoin gains value...  I think they don't necessarily get effected that much.  They are valued relative to each other right now anyway so if they all lose a little value to a new player in the market I don't think anyone would notice any significant change in their fiat.  Of course the people in bitcoin who suddenly get a big increase in their wealth will notice.

Bitcoin is special because it's the first, largest and prime mover crypto-currency .  It's growing an infrastructure that continually adds support for itself as it grows and shuts out competition--google network effect for more if you care.  This is no different from how gold stays as the prime choice over its alternatives.  It's no different from how ebay stays as the prime choice over its alternatives.  This is the reality of how social networks operate and as such it's predictable.

I've traded futures for years and I've never taken delivery (or made delivery).  My brokerage doesn't even support it, it will actually automatically sell me out of any contracts that might come up for delivery.
The price of a futures contract is whatever people will pay for it just like with anything.  What causes a contract to relate to the price of the underlying is upon expiration of the contract (which happens every few months), someone could demand delivery.  So if the price gets too far away from the real bitcoin price, someone could sell futures contracts and buy bitcoin (or vice versa) and then stand for delivery to capture the price difference--this is called arbitrage.   I understand that actual delivery is rare.  And the question comes up with the futures market so highly leveraged is the tail wagging the dog.  Are holders of gold/bitcoin setting price?  Or are futures traders actually setting price using leverage and without ever even owning gold/bitcoin?

Most of that is actually irrelevant in my view.  It's perhaps interesting that we can suppose a "why" to deflation and the subsequent money printing reaction, but it's a red herring. The reality is we're in a serious situation regardless how we got into it. We have enormous debt, very high deficits, and now we're rapidly expanding the monetary base of a fully fiat currency at shocking rates.  Historically these are precisely the elements that lead to the near term failure of a currency (and often the government issuing the currency).  Frankly I care less about debates on deflation than I do that we are likely staring into the abyss and not only is nothing being done, there is a complete denial (or ignorance) of the danger we are in from those we trust to run our finances.  Do you think the debt levels won't keep rising?  The budget deficits to magically turn around?  The extreme monetary base expansion to end?  None of that will stop--why would it when nobody can admit it's even a problem? So there wasn't a failure in 2008, so what?  There will be one in 2018.  Or 2022. Or 2024.  History tells us it is inevitable given our situation and direction.
So, fuck them.  We can prepare ourselves for what lies ahead.  We can move to a new system that will last through the failure of the other. That's what bitcoin is and why it was born from the fires of 2008.  Those that think it's just a cool new payment system don't have a clue. Bitcoin is a life boat.  Get on board before the gangways are torn down by capital controls in the futile belief that preventing people from protecting themselves will somehow delay the inevitable.

Here's some wisdom to go with your alleged intelligence--I could take a random homeless guy and find something he knows better than you.  Obviously it would be foolish to then conclude you're stupider than a random homeless guy, but that's precisely the line you're walking.  But this is beside the point, I'm not challenging your intelligence or credentials, I'm merely pointing out your comments have been less helpful than the original post.  Of course you don't have to be helpful, even as an expert, but then it's also fair for anyone to point out the deficiency.
You haven't helped any journalist anywhere--someone just doing their job and not necessarily doing anything illegal. Your advice to them is apparently to report only on the latest fashions or otherwise avoid reporting on anything important if it might be controversial. That's expert advice?  To give up on the truth and be a coward, while implying they are too stupid to understand the technical risks they face and should avoid angering the machine as that would be more prudent than informing the public about possible issues with the machine.

You misunderstand fractional reserve banking.  Under FRB with a 10% reserve requirement, if a bank is given a dollar they reserve 10% ($0.10) and loan out $0.90.  However that $0.90 usually comes right back into the banking system via whoever it was loaned to as a deposit.  Then the bank can reserve %10 of that $0.90 and loan out the remaining $0.81.  Mathematically this continues until $10 has been created "out of thin air" in loans by the banking system over the original $1.  But the bank cannot simply loan out $100 from a $1 deposit.

You are talking about a value and a future that already exists. Bitcoin is already useful for consumer purchases. The time to invest for that future was a couple years ago, and we made it--we made bitcoin useful for consumer purchases (even paypal is getting on board).  The future value I'm talking about is where hundreds of millions and even billions in value can be transferred with bitcoin. These are transfers between entities like billionaires, companies and governments. That is not possible today as bitcoin's entire market cap is only $5 billion. Bitcoin is too small to manage that kind of value exchange now... but in the future I think it will. But price must rise significantly for that to happen. So I hold for THAT future. And people with a similar vision that hold bitcoin for that future are what help make that future arrive.

I have access to the broad regulated markets (stocks, futures, options, etc.) so I don't feel the need to trade alt coins.  I don't think it's worth the risk of the exchange losing/stealing my coins (or simply having the value crash to zero overnight without me able to get out) over trading something regulated. 
As for bitcoin I don't trade it because I expect it will return significantly better simply holding it and letting it grow (and so far that has been the right play).

Wow, you don't get it.  Bitcoin is not enforced by law.  Laws are relevant only in particular locations and require governments and other 3rd parties.  Bitcoin is global and distributed.  It works not by law but by mathematical requirement.  Anything bitcoin disallows it disallows in a fundamental way in software and process.  For example, in bitcoin it's not "illegal" to spend bitcoin from someone else's address, it's not possible.  If you can spend bitcoin at an address it is because you have the private key to that address and thus are allowed to spend it.  Laws are not relevant. 
This is why bitcoin is resistant to government attack--it doesn't care about law, it simply functions by mathematics.  If some government makes it illegal it keeps operating anyway.  You can't outlaw 1+1=2.

You are right to a large extent, but only in the short term. In the longer term there are significant rumblings in the monetary universe and people will eventually care about bitcoin as the current system continues to fail them.

I agree, litecoin should die too.  But it's not about limiting choices, it's about how the market perceives the validity of crypto.  If there is a practical chance of some future coin taking over an established coin then nobody can expect any coin to be viable long term.  We're not talking video games where more choice is better, we're talking about a viable store of value.  If a monetary store of value is not seen as viable long term then it won't be trusted and won't take off.

You can argue theory with yourself, the reality is there's not a single year in US dollar fiat history (since 1971) where the CPI went down.  Every year it goes up.  The dollar has lost around 85% of its value in my lifetime alone.  
The other reality is fiat value is more controlled by politics than economics.  And government is horrible at managing money and that's why the lifespan of fiat is so short in practice.  Try to find a fiat currency in all of history that has lasted longer than a handful of decades.

Libor is rigged, naked selling floods markets, garbage loans are sold as A rated, allocated gold accounts are sold where no gold exists even as they charge people storage fees to store nothing, and on and on. And it continues because even if they get caught nobody goes to prison and the fines aren't even as high as the profits that were made. Anyone is a fool to trust a system so clearly crooked when it's trivial to buy real bitcoin.
That's even assuming there not some legal way in the rules to cheat. Maybe they don't really have to back the fund with bitcoin under some circumstances--who knows with the complexity of the documents. Nobody seems to know for sure how the gold etf actually interacts with real physical gold. Does the fund just buy another 3rd party promising ownership of gold but it's really just futures or gold already owned by someone else?  Who knows, it's all a gaint mess of trust in a system that has proven time and gime again that it can't be trusted. Just give me a damn bitcoin instead.

If the dollar were failing it's likely that most other major fiat currencies would be suffering a similar crisis. The world would be waking up to the reality that history has already shown over and over again:  fiat currency does not last.  Bitcoin is different, it's not fiat, and that's why I would bet that it would be the obvious solution.  Obviously you're free to have a different opinion.
Also I think your view of what would happen in a bad currency crisis is naive.  The nature of a hyperinflationary crisis is at its core caused by the agents in the economy losing confidence in a currency and trying not to take it or hold it.  Your description of what amazon would do is at odds with what actually happens.  Agents in the economy are trying not to take dollars but you say they have to have dollars regardless?  If that were true currency crises wouldn't ever happen--but they do happen.  Also it's not trivial to hedge or convert during a currency crisis, that's another aspect of the currency crisis in the first place.

Every day there is a non-trivial number of bitcoins sold on the exchanges by miners mining for the daily 3600 new coins as they have to meet costs, pay investors, reinvest, etc.  Those coins have to be continually purchased by the general market demand.  That sale pressure from sales of newly mined coins will be cut in half at the next halving.  All else being equal price will have to rise to find a new equilibrium without those sales.  That's not wishful thinking, that's supply and demand.

Bitpay is not bitcoin.  Bitpay converts bitcoin payments to dollars for vendors on purchase.  If a vendor wants to take bitcoin they can take bitcoin directly and no business is there to stop them.  But if they want a service that pays them dollars, that service might have rules and limitations (likely associated with the dollar aspect of the business, not the bitcoin aspect).

Bitcoin is special in that it is the one with momentum and growing network effect.  It's the same with how many precious metals could've been on top but gold is the one that got the momentum and network effect.  Bitcoin isn't likely to be overthrown by another coin in the same way gold isn't likely to be overthrown by silver, platinum or some new material that might get discovered/invented at any time.  The reason is because gold is already in place with an infrastructure with markets and vaults full of gold bars, etc. that make it extremely difficult for any competing material to overtake its position.  Bitcoin has the same infrastructure and network effect happening for it.  
Unfortunately for gold bitcoin is taking over its position in the digital realm because gold doesn't work there.  That's unfortunate for us gold bugs, but that's the reality we have to deal with. I can recognize what is happening and position myself accordingly.  Gold is not being re-monetized as many of us expected, but bitcoin IS being newly monetized and there is a lot of money to be made as that process advances.
Thanks for wishing me luck.  I think as a speculation bitcoin has a payoff like a lottery ticket but with much better odds at paying off than a lottery ticket.  I can't imagine why everyone else doesn't buy such a ticket.  In fact that's what we're seeing...  more people buying in every year in an exponential growth curve.  If that ever changes I might start to worry, but so far everything is going as I expect and I'd be an idiot to not be on this train--this is a once in a lifetime thing.

Sorry but you can't use modern industrial uses for gold as a reason why it became money when it existed as money long before those uses were discovered.  Historically gold was a useless metal only good for decoration.  Only kings and those who had excess wealth could afford to buy and decorate with an otherwise useless metal.  That association with status/wealth is what helped gold become money along with its good money properties, not its supposed natural usefulness.  It's actually critical that a good money be mostly useless as I explain in another comment.
As for using a digital currency backed by gold (and things like the gold standard), the problem there is you're not using gold as money, you're using whatever this backing agent is.  And of course the backing agent has all the issues associated with bad money...  who creates/controls/distributes it?  Who manages its backing to gold and what keeps that from getting abused/corrupted?  If you're a gold bug you know if it's not physical gold in your hand it's not gold.
That's why bitcoin is special.  Bitcoin is actually digital property that is really exchanging on the digital plane just like physical gold coins exchange on the physical plane.  It doesn't suffer from the problems representative monies (e.g. backed currencies) suffer and eventually fail from.
When I say bitcoin is digital gold I mean it literally.  Bitcoin solves significant problems that most people aren't even aware exist because they don't understand gold and money.  As that is recognized over time bitcoin's usage and value will continue to expand (and gold's might contract).

You're merely describing the mess of a system that comes from conflating an asset with a claim on the asset or a representation of the asset.  Bitcoin does not have that problem.  The system that will arise around bitcoin will not need to conflate bitcoin with bitcoin-debt or bitcoin representations.  The problems of conflating asset and representation of asset arose from the limitations of gold.  Now we have an asset-based money (bitcoin) that does not need representational money added to it to patch up its limitations.  We don't have to create representations of bitcoin to send around and develop complex trust systems to manage these representations, we can just send bitcoin itself!  
You seem to think bitcoin must become like the existing money system, but I think you are wrong.  What will arise will be different, unique and new (like bitcoin is different, unique, and new).  I've tried to explain some of what might happen (proof of reserves, clear distinctions between bitcoin and bitcoin-debt, etc.), but I really don't know exactly what will happen...  but I do know with bitcoin asset based money systems that COULDN'T practically exist before now can.

The dollar is not backed by someone else's oil in any meaningful sense.  Other countries can stop using dollars as a means of exchange and reserve at any time, and in fact that's started happening recently.
Nor are fiat currencies supported by armies.  Rome had hundreds of years of history of exploiting their citizens to overpay their armies believing that particular myth.  Unfortunately what happens is eventually your economy loses its ability to generate enough real wealth to exploit to pay your army.  Printing money can then work for a short while but eventually the army leaves when it can't be paid in money with value and your empire collapses.  Another more recent example you might be familiar with is of a superpower and its massive army that collapsed anyway: Russia. 
The US is already at the fiat money printing stage.  Wish us luck, we'll need it.

Pro tip:  These cards work great with the Mycelium phone wallet and its "cold storage" function.  You keep the card in your wallet and when you want to send coin you scan the card with your phone cam, enter your password, do transaction.  Mycelium sends the transaction, automatically puts any change back on the card, and then forgets about the card password/address.
Coins are not kept on your phone so it doesn't matter if the phone is lost/stolen.  Coins on the card are safe if someone steals the card thanks to BIP 38 password.  You keep a copy or two of the card  so it's safe from loss/theft.  Super secure, easy to use.
EDIT: The above tip is for use with the BIP 38 private key encrypted cards.  Don't go carrying around cards with unencrypted private keys.

Bitcoin transactions at their core are already "under the table" by design and yet transfer and ownership of the bitcoin digital property is highly secure.  Nothing else does that--the whole concept of secure yet largely anonymous digital property exchange is new with bitcoin.  The base is there but there is a lot more to do--the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem will get there in time but it will take a while.
In the meantime don't give your private keys to other parties (e.g. mtgox).  The basics of bitcoin work without needing such centralized services.  Wait for services that are provably secure (they will be coming).

But from experience I will tell you chasing that chimera  is a huge waste of time and money.

As for  debt in your own currency not mattering, there are dozens of failed currencies of even modern history that disagree. Wtf do you think happens when debts and spending vs income (deficit) get so high there is nothing left to do but print money to meet debt payments and costs? You think once that point is reached that just because the debts are in your own currency you don't go into a currency destroying death spiral? You shouldn't even need to pick up a history book to figure out you're wrong there, just think for half a second.

That chart is what got me into bitcoins. Before 2012 I was aware of bitcoin but expected it was a bubble and would crash and burn. And it did, sort of. But it didn't die; it based and started to rebound--that's not what bubbles do. So I started looking into it deeper and was quickly convinced.  I suspect the same thing will happen with this price decline.  All the people currently patting themselves on their back for how they correctly called bitcoin bubble will be surprised over the next year.

The paper currency notes are tokens of debt created (or destroyed) by the treasury based on customer demand from the banks. If there is high demand for cash, paper money is created and sent to banks; when demand is low paper money is taken back and destroyed. But all the notes are tokens of existing debt. If there was no debt because it had all been paid off there would be no notes created as tokens of that debt as it wouldn't exist.

@_date: 2014-09-14 11:05:36
That's not true. At current prices bitcoin literally doesn't have the size to do large transactions like handle buying/selling a sports team or medium cap  company as those can be larger than the entire bitcoin marketcap. It doesn't have the size to even handle a small cap company exchange or large B2B transactions because buying/selling multiple millions in bitcoin moves price around too much. In order to be useful for transactions beyond trivial consumer transactions total market cap (and price) must rise significantly. $10,000 per coin is conservative if bitcoin continues to take off.  Even at $10,000 per coin billion dollar transactions (transactions at the level of large cap companies or small governments) still won't be possible.  Gold (which bitcoin was modeled after) handles transactions in the hundreds of billions and has a market cap in the trillions.  If bitcoin reaches near that it would have to go into the six digits per coin range.

Also we were recently in a deflation (some would say we're still in it) and did the dollar fall?  No, they printed the shit out of the dollar to keep it going up.

I don't know if this has happened yet, but at some point it no doubt will. Similar things have happened on large, regulated exchanges, so no doubt the small, largely unregulated world of bitcoin will be a target for similar shenanigans at some point once there is enough ability to short and use derivatives like futures.
It's an unfortunate reality that price is decided by the flow of a relatively small number of bitcoin that actively trade on exchanges at any moment. It doesn't take much to move the price, especially if a centralized exchange sells "paper" bitcoin or derivatives with no basis in reality.  Nothing stops a centralized exchange from doing such things as the blockchain is not used as the clearing mechanism in the exchange itself and there is no visibility into the centralized mechanisms that are used.
I hope eventually centralized exchanges with their closed and propriety order matching and clearing that can be used to falsify order flow will be replaced with decentralized exchanges where visibility keeps such things from happening.  But we're not there yet, so who knows what really goes on.  Mtgox-like failure isn't the only way centralized exchanges can screw the community.

Lost revenue due to falling prices are matched by money being worth more.  As prices fall it's natural that wages should fall (no different than wages going up for cost of living in today's inflationary environment).   Sticky wages have a number of contributing causes including bad debts and government interference in the market.  Government needs to not interfere in the market (e.g. it cannot set minimum wages in a market with a deflationary currency).  And debts must be responsible/productive as non-productive debts will quickly lead to default in a deflationary environment--and that is not a bad thing.  You can see how the opposite has led to out of control debts in all facets of our economy today.  In short the economic environment of a deflationary money is different than our reality today and there would be changes required but these are not bad changes, they are good changes.  I suppose from the perspective of the government or from a bad debtor it's not good, but we should not base our entire economic markets around the non-productive and/or irresponsible agents.  
As an additional point deflation or inflation of a cryptocurrency is just a parameter.  An inflationary cryptocurrency could just as easily be adopted if the people decided.  I actually expect that bitcoin will be changed at some point in the future to stop its halving process leaving it forever inflating at some small rate--I suspect this will happen because a majority of people will find it useful at some point in the future to make that change and it will be adopted.  The possibility of things like that with cryptocurrency should make you realize what bitcoin really is and what it means.
The key aspect is that money be honest--predefined mathematical (or natural) rules should be followed by all with no authority given the right to control the money so that it can engorge itself, abuse the savers, and pick winners/losers at its whim as we have today.  How anyone can defend the current system is beyond me.  The current problems in the system are such much bigger than minor inflation/deflation debates...  we're possibly facing the complete destruction of the fiat dollar in the next decade or two and we have a thousand years of fiat history showing us fiat does not last long.  Managed money doesn't work for long and as a result the current system is doomed and rapidly failing.  The real question is what do we create to replace it as it destroys itself?  Bitcoin is a decent option--the best I've ever seen.

Governments and their fiat come and go.  What seems solid today can be gone tomorrow.  The only constant through history is no fiat has ever lasted more than a few generations (and usually only a few decades).  Based on history we can conclude that there will likely come a time in the future when bitcoin will seem solid compared to even once strong fiat currencies.  And that time might not be more a decade or two away...  countries like the US, Japan, etc. are currently printing their currencies at an unprecedented rate... literally by the trillions.  That doesn't end well.

OpenBazaar isn't a thirty party.  It's an open source, distributed system like bitcoin.  There is no third party that owns/runs it.  Same with Open Transactions.  
There is a fundamental change that has happened with bitcoin that will effect our financial future and perhaps you don't quite get it yet.  At its core bitcoin solved a long standing problem that makes distributed financial systems possible.  Much of the current financial system exists simply because you have to have a centralized, trusted 3rd party to manage a database to keep track of aspects of financial transactions.  Now that can be done away with.  The entire purpose of a large (and very expensive) section of the existing financial system is fundamentally no longer needed.  I don't expect banks to go away completely, but they are likely to change significantly.  It might be similar to what happened to newspapers after the internet came out...  they didn't go away, but they're not exactly needed anymore either and are having to adapt or die.

The door is always there.  The quicker the weak hands give up and leave the quicker bitcoin continues to do what it's going to do.  At the moment we're in a pullback...  a pullback no different than many before.  It will end when enough bitcoin has shifted from weak to strong hands and not sooner.  The weak hands that were never going to succeed will be shaken off the bull before we continue on, that's how these things work.   
To be honest we haven't even really been tested yet... price pattern is still very bullish and obvious on a chart with weekly bars. A lot of people can see that (maybe too many).

The move from here to $10,000 actually won't be that difficult IMO.  At $10,000 per bitcoin you're talking about a market cap size of "only" 130 billion.  That's similar in value to a big company like Pepsi, Disney or VISA but small for a global currency.  As a currency, $10,000 per coin puts bitcoin in the range of regional currencies like those of Finland or Denmark.  At $130 billion bitcoin would be a global currency smaller than the top 20 world currencies and significantly smaller than the top 5 currencies which are measured in the trillions. 
By the way, those top 5 currencies are where you get to the point of what everyone would recognize as a global currency.   For bitcoin to go up another factor of 10 to $100,000 it would have to start to challenge those trillion dollar global currencies and that I think would be difficult (but maybe not impossible if bitcoin really took off--after all, that's where the other global currencies are valued).

1. There has been no reserve currency that was fiat until the 1970's US dollar.
2. Reserve status does not last forever.  Events are happening now that signal the beginning of the end to the reserve status of the dollar.  2008 shook the world's confidence in the dollar--I don't expect reserve status to exist in any real sense within 10-20 years (perhaps sooner).  Here's some related news just from today (notice the comparison chart at the end of the article that shows how long reserve status lasts historically).  [China and Russia enter non-dollar settlement deal](


Our monetary system of fiat money created by a central bank is the same as the systems used in more than 100 cases of hyperinflation. History shows our currency absolutely can fail despite our debt being denominated in our own currency.  A government that prints fiat currency really can run out of money, as the currency can fail to be good money at some point. 


A country is not a household but neither is a country immune from economic realities and the lessons of history.  The result of a fiat-based government spending far more than they take in by taxes (budget deficit) combined with high debt and active base money creation is hyperinflation.  We have dozens of cases of this happening in the last hundred years alone and not a single example of a fiat currency surviving long in this situation in all of history.  


Interest rates are currently being manipulated by the Fed to be close to zero percent.  This is not an indication of the health of the economy, it is a manipulation designed to hide the terrible state of the system.  In short you can't point to interest rates to mean safety and stability these days, they actually mean the opposite now.  Such a low interest rate for a sustained period is actually devastating later as nearly unsustainable levels of debt rapidly become unsustainable when interest rates rise to normal levels.  This fact is why printing will never stop now--they can't let rates rise to normal levels, ever.  So we spin in this state until the wheels come off the system.


It's possible we recover and the inevitable end of the fiat dollar is put off for another few decades.  However what is happening now is precisely the situation when currencies die--hyperinflations follow deflations.  No fiat currency in history has lasted more than a generation or two and most die within a decade or two.  We are already 40+ years into this latest fiat experiment and the situation is grim.  Currently we are not recovering, we are manipulating interest rates, the market, inflation numbers/expectations, unemployment numbers and just about every other relevant measure.  The markets won't be fooled in the long term.  Manipulations and endless talk of an eventual happy end are fantasy.  Reality is that we've been printing trillions in base money for over 6 years now, major countries are actively making deals to negate our reserve status, we have debt levels over historical failure levels, and deficit levels only over historical failure levels since 2008 due to the Fed's market pumping and the associated tax receipts (soon to turn bad again on the next downturn, to say nothing of what happens when we eventually lose reserve status).
I wish I could be as optimistic as you, but I understand the situation and history too well.  The good news is budget deficits have been heading the right way since 2009...  but will that last?  We were in failure territory just a few years ago (with the government spending nearly double what they took in) and I expect we'll be right back again on the next market downturn.

I didn't say it was.  It was a precursor to bitcoin that used proof-of-work and other concepts adopted by bitcoin.  Bitcoin itself is a deflationary digital currency modeled after gold...  and if you knew anything about either gold or early digital currencies, you'd know that already.  
Anyway you're clearly some hardheaded newbie who got into bitcoin long after the discussions about gold and bitcoin were common.  So you go live in your fantasy world and pretend bitcoin has nothing to do with gold.  Again, it's no skin off my nose.

The amount of demand is largely irrelevant to the point.  Whatever demand is, it will suddenly find itself with half the daily supply from new coins it used to have.  That's a significant supply shock (probably over $750,000 worth of coins less a day being available at today's prices by my estimation).  If demand/price was previously relatively constant, with the reduction in supply price will rise.  If demand/price was rising, afterward price will rise faster.  If demand/price was falling, afterward price will slow its decline or reverse.  This is an environment where it's safe to assume bitcoin will still be growing fast.  I think saying the price will rise is a fair prediction for such an event.

You are wrong and make an irrelevant point. Here is data from the USDA you can review:
You'll notice "all wheat" from 1912/1913 was $0.80 and 100 years later in 2012/2013 was $7.77, around 2.2% annual inflation (not 0.7%). That inflation has happened despite wheat technology improvements (also in the table) pushing up yields per acre nearly 4x in that time (which is quite deflationary). But this is irrelevant to the point.
The point being made isn't the long term inflation of wheat, which wasn't bad until more recently... the point is it's recently become bad, which the table also shows. Prices were largely flat in the data until 1971 when we completely went off the gold standard. *Annual inflation since 1970 price of $1.25 has been 4.3%.* And prices have spiked even sharper around the last financial crisis basically doubling as I pointed out using your own charts and can be seen in the USDA data too--*annual inflation rate of over 10% since 2005.* That's the point. Recent inflation in wheat has been nowhere near 2%.
Most people don't need to go digging through the USDA data, they know it's bad just from going to the grocery store and seeing their grocery bill rise much faster than 2% the last several years.  If you were to move out of your parents basement and do your own grocery shopping you'd notice these things too.

Bip38 keys are useless without their password, so no they can't be used even if stolen or if a bank peeks at them. This is not true of your seed keys.
And actually my coins are safe and will go to my heirs on my death. The BIP38 keys are locked in a safety deposit box (which are useless if stolen by themselves). Passwords to the BIP38 keys (also useless by themselves) will be available to my heirs on my death (as will be access to safety deposit box on proof of my death).  
Seed words are single point of failure for loss/theft and death.  BIP38 allows separation and security (plus I have access to my coins at any time as I know the passwords and can keep encrypted copies of the BIP38 keys on the cloud for my own access).

What I learned from the tech bubble centers around the discovery that security in the current financial system is an illusion.  There is no security in the dollar, it is based on nothing (even more so than bitcoin).  And worse its foundations (e.g. debt levels, deficit levels, base currency level, etc.) are getting worse and worse by the year.   I have plenty of dollar based investments so what is the point in "cashing out" alternative investments to even more of that insecure medium?  Bitcoin is risky in many ways but it is not risky in the way the dollar is risky.  Holding bitcoin is a hedge against systemic risk in the dollar-based financial system.  And that sort of hedge is rare.  It's even more rare if you're looking for significant potential upside gains from your hedge.   So no, I'm not looking to sell my bitcoin...  but I have some extra dollars to buy yours if you're selling.

I agree gold has small purposes outside of being money that would give it some value if it wasn't money, but that's not what gives it the high value it holds. Bitcoin also has some small purpose outside of being money... it is a unique and new form of property that exists on the digital plane rather than the physical plane. That might be worth something even if it wasn't used as money. But for both gold and bitcoin these other uses are not what values them.
As for properties of good money not applying to bitcoin, you are simply wrong. In today's world bitcoin is a better money than gold... it's gold that no longer fits the modern list of properties that a good money must meet. Gold cannot be transferred in what is becoming the most common medium for value transfer now: online. What good is a money that can't be used where people demand it the most? But the new digital property thing called bitcoin can be used in this new medium. And it's divisible, easy to validate, difficult to fake, rare, etc.  You and Schiff need to wake up and see the digital gold sitting right in front of you. We don't live in the same world as we did 40 years ago.

Our current money system is massively transferring wealth to the rich and connected on a level that would and could never happen with honest money like bitcoin. Right now they can simply print money out of thin air, devaluing (stealing) the money already held by everyone, and giving the new momey to whoever they want. You can't compare that sort of systemic value redistribution to deflation. With honest money the poor can at least save their money and it will hold its value or even rise in value. With fiat the value of money is constantly being stolen by those in power and so the poor become constantly poorer by design.

If you could remove thousands of years of history of being money from gold and just have a pretty, non-corroding soft metal, with little industrial demand, what do you think it would be worth? I'd say nowhere near $1200 per oz. Even people that buy it as jewelry don't buy it just because it's pretty, lots of things are pretty, they buy it because it's pretty and has a history of high value and status that comes from its monetary side. In India, the largest gold jewelry market, gold is status/wealth in wearable form.
So the majority of gold's value comes from it's monetary side which comes from it's unique properties which make it good money: easy to recognize, difficult to fake, durable, divisible, rare, industrially mostly useless, etc. These same properties bitcoin has but better. Bitcoin is actually a significantly better money than gold in our digital age and it fills a large open need gold can't fill and fiat monies don't have the long term stability to fill--that is what gives bitcoin its value.  
Schiff stands there talking up gold hoping people will start using it again as money. But what he misses is the requirements modern money needs to fill have significantly changed over the last few decades to the point where gold can't fill them anymore. Gold is no longer the best money, it cannot be used in a digital world in the same ways it used to be used when it was money (but bitcoin can). Schiff needs to update his mental list of what constitutes good money, and if he did that he'd realize bitcoin fits the requirements while gold does not. That's difficult to do because people don't even understand what a distributed digital property is because it's new with bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold... and it hasn't been recognized for what it is by most of the world yet. It's like there is a $1200 gold coin sitting there for the taking at $10 but almost nobody recognizes it yet.

I'm not making a political statement, I'm making a statement about how people respond to the issues with the financial system.  In this case those that are being sanctioned will likely want to avoid the sanction which means avoiding financial systems controlled by other countries.  The sanctions being good or bad is irrelevant to my point.  
In the same way those in Cyprus might not want to have capital controls imposed on them or have their money taken by bail-ins, so they will tend to move to bitcoin.  This is regardless if capital controls or bail-ins are considered good or bad by some internet troll in an entirely different country.

It's not necessarily the lending practices I was commenting on so much as the response of bailouts by money printing.  But to answer your question, under a money like bitcoin lending doesn't get as out of control in a number of ways because bitcoin is not a debt-based currency like the dollar is. In a system like the dollar, the money literally comes into existence by lending (not say by mining as with gold and bitcoin) and the amount of lending/debt must constantly increase for the system to continue. The incentives in a debt-based system are for more and more lending/borrowing and eventually to non-productive borrowing and that leads to more bad quality debt and eventual collapse/default. Before the 70's dollars still had a tie to gold and credit cards were rare and only held by the rich. People didn't go into debt for everything like they do today. Our ever growing debt and the related ever worsening debt practices (and the eventual resulting economic decline) are the nature of our current system. In a system where inflation and debt aren't built in and incentivized, lending is rarer and naturally more limited to productive debt (debt for efforts like education and business that tends to produce the money used to pay the debt back). Lending practices could still have occasional issues but such issues would be rare rather than systemic as they are with the dollar system.

Businesses that use services like bitpay and coinbase can choose what percentage of bitcoin purchases they receive in bitcoin and how much in dollars.  The CEO of Overstock.com told reddit that they keep 10% of every purchase in bitcoin and are looking to pay suppliers and employees in bitcoin if they wished.  Do you have the percentage numbers for Dell or Expedia to make the blanket statement you are making that they keep none?  I bet you don't.  But either way you're obviously wrong when you say those companies will never actually own a single bitcoin as Overstock already does.  Many small companies have announced on reddit that they take 100% in bitcoin.  You simply don't know what you're talking about.
As for bitcoin being unstable, deflationary, and cumbersome, I don't see the problem.  It's unstable yes, but has been going up thousands of percent a year since its inception and such growth has volatility as part of that.  If you can't handle the volatility that comes with extreme growth stay out until bitcoin is more mature.  Deflationary is not a problem unless you're a debt-based currency which bitcoin is not (note that gold is a deflationary money too and has worked for thousands of years).  And cumbersome is simply wrong--try using bitcoin sometime and see what a pleasure it is to use.

Just add the new standard and then add code to switch to the new standard at some specific block in the blockchain (using older standards on the older blocks).

You're still focused on price. What good is a price set in a derivatives market when the asset underlying the derivative is being removed from that market? There are hundreds of oz of paper claims to every real oz of gold floating around in the derivatives markets--those claims are not rare nor are they actually gold. It's like mtgox... who is going to have bitcoin when the traders wake up to the fact that derivative games in centralized exchanges are not bitcoin and the bitcoin supposedly underlying the market was removed by the real players some time ago leaving the blind and dumb traders with huge losses?
With mtgox there wasn't much warning but with gold there is backwardation. There is a measure that tells us the physical holders are leaving the building. And almost nobody knows about it.

I put cold storage coins in a BIP38 paper wallet address using a password I've memorized.  I put the paper wallet in a safety deposit box along with instructions about what it is, how to use it, and that the password for it can be found clearly marked in my personal things in the event of my death.  As the BIP38 address is password protected the paper wallet can't be used if the box contents are accessed unauthorized or stolen.
I put the password to the paper wallet and an explanation about the wallet in the safety deposit box in a tamper evident envelope and lock it in a fire safe at home with other significant documents.  If the fire safe is stolen the password alone does no good without access to the safety deposit box.  In the event of my death the password will be found and the bank will allow access to the safety deposit box to my family with proof of my death (hence the inheritance plan).  If the envelope is ever tampered with I move the coins.
Of course you can also keep encrypted copies of the paper wallet on the cloud for your own use.  So in the end my coins are safe, I have access to them anytime I want (and only I have access), and I know they will go to my family if I were to die tomorrow.

What does it matter if some small number of coins continue to trickle in a long time from now?  It's a tiny inflation rate compared to the number of coins in existence and it gives miners something to keep mining.

And again it's such a tiny inflation rate it doesn't matter.

Is it a threat? That's really the question isn't it?  I don't think that Dogecoin and other altcoins threatens bitcoin in any real sense but that's just a guess.  The strongest argument against crypto in my opinion is that it isn't viable as it's trivial to copy.  So is that argument valid?  I think it's not and that the altcoins will fail and prove the argument doesn't hold but we'll have to see.  So either doge and 99% of the other altcoins will be a money losing experiment that costs people a lot of money... or all cryptos will be.  Either way I don't see dogecoin as a good thing.  It's just some silliness that has to happen to see if cryptos are viable.  I'd wish dogecoin good luck but I see no outcome where doge turns out well.  So I'll instead hope it dies quickly with the other useless alts so bitcoin can move to the next stage.

If you lived in New York you might be blocked by various bitcoin services that don't have the funds, ability or desire to deal with the overreaching nonsense of the New York BitLicense. If you were employed by a bitcoin service that was in New York you might lose your job as the service moves somewhere more bitcoin friendly. If you're not in New York not much happens beyond maybe not being able to buy stuff from New York businesses with bitcoin (because they wouldn't be able to get bitcoin service providers to work with them)..
This would be temporary though as New York would repeal the BitLicense at some point to avoid being locked out of bitcoin and the future it's bringing (and from the backlash from New York businesses and citizens).

You still don't hold your property, you are relying on third parties and rule of law to make you whole.  Gold is for when third parties and rule of law break down.  Do you think an insurance payment in (failing) dollars for the spot value of gold will make you whole in a financial crisis where gold is no longer for sale at any dollar price? Do you think an allocated account will be worth anything in a social/political breakdown where rule of law breaks down (e.g. like what happened in Russia in the 90s on the breakdown of the political and economic structure)? The people that really hold your gold will simply keep it and you can show your contractual guarantees to the wind.
Allocated gold accounts are a shortcut to a dead-end for people who don't understand what gold is really about. They fail exactly at the moment physical gold is desired and needed most. I wouldn't touch one with a ten foot pole.

Dollars depend on the faith and credit of the US government. If the government needed to they could devalue the dollar overnight and make it worth half its value or something (before you say they wouldn't do that you should realize that they already have, more than once). The rest of the world could wake up tomorrow and decide they don't like how the government runs itself and sell dollars crashing the value of the currency. These by definition are rare things that don't happen often but they do happen, and not as rarely as you image. 
As for people excepting bitcoin debt over bitcoin, some might. That's their choice. The market can offer it to them and they can take the associated risks if they choose. That's why people have lost millions in bitcoin from various failed exchanges because they think the risk of losing their bitcoin was worth the benefit of being able to trade. Ask mtgox users, or any other users of the many failed exchanges if it was worth it.  But its their choice.  Regardless the majority won't do that I think. It won't ever be a systemic issue like it is with dollars for a number of reasons including the fact it puts your bitcoin at risk, puts your bitcoin into the dollar system with all its money control nonsense, keeps you from getting the benefits of bitcoin (like being able to send them anywhere, travel with them anywhere, have privacy and control, etc.).

If this were 2012 you might have a point.  Back then when I first got into bitcoin it was taking quite a risk.  There wasn't anywhere near the infrastructure, adoption or usefulness that there is today.  You had to have some serious foresight to see where bitcoin was headed. But today the actual growth has been incredible and anyone who isn't completely clueless can see where its going.
There are tens to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin being transferred every day (which you can watch flowing in real time here):
You can use bitcoin to buy things instantly on thousands of websites around the world with more coming online every day.  In 2012 nobody would've believed multi-billion dollar companies like Dell or Expedia would be actively using bitcoin today.
There are dozens of new bitcoin-related businesses popping up every month; hundreds of millions flowing into bitcoin venture funding; multiple wall street bitcoin products coming online in the next few months; etc., etc.
The price gains have been exciting, but those gains have been coupled with striking infrastructure changes in the real world.  So I guess I don't really know what you're talking about.  Maybe you're stuck in 2012?  Maybe you're confusing bitcoin and gold...?  Because I would agree gold is largely irrelevant and useless these days.

It's not about delivery so much as ownership.  Even gox could deliver coins for a while even when they only had a few.  The issue is ownership.

Bitcoin is not useful at these prices as market cap is too small to move much value. It must go up in value to actually achieve the usefulness of trading in larger values like companies and countries would use it for.  Bitcoin is just as useful for little consumer purchases OP talks about at $100,000 as at $385. Spending bitcoin at these prices does nothing but keep price down.

Actually what he said is absolutely wrong because bitcoin is a money not a stock, real estate or other productive asset and derives its value completely differently than those assets do.  He doesn't discuss at all the whys and hows of a money having value and is apparently unaware of the issues (as apparently you are as well).

There are ways to secure personal gold where it remains physically available to you in extreme cases and near impossible to be known about or stolen.  Gold held by third parties won't be there in exactly the cases where gold is needed most.  And if you don't think fiat (and insurance contracts that pay out in fiat) can fail... or don't think rule of law ever can break down even in what was once the most advanced society... you need to open a fucking history book.
If what you want is assets that work fine in cases where allocated accounts work, just by any wall street asset...  get something that pays a divided for god sake instead of charging you storage fees.  Gold is for something very different and you have to keep in mind why you hold it and what possible events you hold it for. And in many of those cases allocated accounts are simply not appropriate.

Not sure where you're getting half of that or why you're being upvoted--you are wrong.  Open an account at any ordinary brokerage and buy some stock.  Your shares are reported to be in your account but the reality is they will be loaned out to shorters at any time and you are not paid interest nor are you even notified your shares have been borrowed and sold by someone else.  Better yet sell a stock short.  You'll find you pay no interest nor is there any fixed period you agree to hold the borrowed shares, you can hold short as long as you wish. The only payment you make to the original shareholder is in the event the stock pays a divided... since you sold the borrowed shares to someone else (and they now get the divided) you must pay the stock divided to the original shareholder.  The original shareholder gets paid the stock divided from you that he wouldve got from the stock, he doesn't gain anything but doesn't lose anything.  He doesn't even know you paid the divided, as far as he know it came from the shares reported to be in his account.

There were a lot of copy-cat airplanes after the Wright Brothers, and those weren't innovative either and nobody remembers them.  But obviously a Jet is an innovation over a prop plane.

One of the things this does, for those that don't get it, is make a distinction between cash and money in the bank. Money in the bank might be devalued where it wouldn't be if you held cash.

Right, young fiat currencies haven't failed yet--they are still in their first few decades.  The dollar, for example, has only been fully fiat since the 70's.  But give them time, historically most fiat currencies fail within a few decades.  None have lasted more than a generation or two (and the longer lasting ones have had some hard currency aspect to them rather than being completely fiat).
From studying examples of currency failure we even have a good idea at what point they will fail based on debt and budget deficit levels.  In the case of the US where debt is already beyond danger levels and budget deficit is close to danger levels, we're probably within 20 years of failure (my estimation).

My non-expert explanation:
A negative interest rate means instead of the financial institution payIng interest on its deposits, it actually charges for them. This is an attempt to force money out of the institution and into the market/economy to stimulate inflation and fight deflation (its trying to force banks to lend). Another option, the one the US and Japan have been taking, is QE (printing money). Europe, and in particular Germany, has a more recent history of the dangers of printing money (i.e. the Weimar hyperinflation) and have been more hesitant to print (also the Euro is odd in that it is used by several independent nations as their national fiat).   As a result they are trying this other historic and extreme response to deflation instead of QE.  The actual effects of negative interest rates are theoretical.

Gold isn't the basis of our money system anymore and hasn't been for decades.  They tried to use gold with fractional reserve lending and it resulted in the government defaulting on gold debt, twice (in 1933 and 1971) and then finally removing gold from the money system all together (in 1971 on the last default).  This happened because you can't use actual property like gold and bitcoin in debt expansion schemes like fractional reserve lending because in the end  you can't fake gold/bitcoin. Eventually people want their actual property instead of the debt substitutes and the fraud collapses.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:40:11
Yeah, gold has been such a terrible currency for thousands of years.  Total failure.  That's why governments and central banks hold it as a base asset.  The digital version must be just as bad.  Avoid that crazy money that actually goes up in value over time with the economy.  Instead jump on board fiat...  nothing like having money whose value falls over time until it dies within a generation or two.  Heck the dollar has lost 85% of its value in my lifetime alone and it's only getting started.  Wait until it has a 60% drop in value overnight, that day should be coming within the next 20 years or so, probably sooner.  Until then you can watch the non-productive areas of the economy (financial and government) get bigger and bigger (because that's where the value being slowly taken from the dollar is going), while the actual productive aspects of the economy gets gutted.  Until the economy collapses and the money dies.  Wake up and open a history book sometime--it's happened every single time with inflating fiat currencies.

You can know what you're doing and still fail spectacularly.  Think of the number of guys like that who thought they could do better by trading bitcoin...   and then lost everything in MtGox or one of the other exchanges that went down and took coin with it.  Exchange risk is not an insignificant factor.  Even profitable traders will very seldom beat an index that is rising.  So once bitcoin starts going up again you'll almost certainly do worse trying to play the swings than simply holding.
If you're long-term bullish on bitcoin, the best thing to do hasn't changed since bitcoin started:  buy it, secure it offline, come back a few years from now and discover you've beat 99% of all traders by doing nothing.

That's an interesting theory, we'll see how it pans out for you.  My money isn't on random internet dude's personal theory but on the thousand years of fiat history and hundreds of examples of fiat failing and NEVER in all of history working longer than a handful of decades.
One major issue you overlook living in your dream world of monetary ignorance is the current dollar system wasn't designed.  The fiat dollar is not the pinnacle of some modern financial genius.  Nobody set out to make a fiat dollar, it came into being how it is today through a series of emergency responses to one crises after another: gold confiscation and dollar devaluation in the 30's depression, complete removal of gold convertibility in the 70's global environment,  just recently panic printing of trillions in new base money to support the system during the 2008 crisis (still going on today and among the final stages of eventual failure), etc.  In the process the dollar has gone down the same road that has destroyed hundreds of previous currencies before it and the same fate llies before it now.  You'd recognize the reality happening and what is to come if you knew anything about the history of money.  Instead you seem to think what has happened was somehow planned and makes the dollar some magnificent financial achievement that will last forever when the exact opposite is true.
The other thing you're apparently unaware of is the global reserve status of the dollar is waning rapidly now after 2008.  Reserve status will be defacto gone within 10 years (maybe sooner) at the rate the dollar is being removed, by-passed and de-emphasized all over the world.  Bitcoin is actually a small part of that.

Wow, you are completely out of your mind.  Bitcoin's entire market cap is around 8 billion and the actively available to trade amount is a fraction of that given people store them away and bitcoin doesn't really have paper markets yet.  Just GLD alone is many times times bigger than Bitcoin and that's just one market instrument.  Gold has many global funds and ETFs (GLD is just one), futures markets, a massive physical market in london, an even larger FX market, etc. Most of those have their own derivative markets on top of that.  In short the gold market in total is huge--TRILLIONS as I've been saying--and you want to say it's not much larger than the bitcoin market?  And you think I'm the one being misleading??

I think the alt-coin thing is starting to take a toll.  To me the biggest threat to bitcoin remains that it's not unique.  There is no safety in bitcoin because a better alt-coin could come along at any moment (e.g. one that was really anonymous).  It might be that bitcoin's first mover status keeps it ahead of the pack, but that is no guarantee. 
The other issue is $600 a coin seems expensive to people, but at least that can be addressed.  We need to standardize on uBTC ("bits") and start talking about thousands of "bits" to the dollar instead of tiny awkward fractions of bitcoin to the dollar.  Most people don't like fractions.  This fractional bitcoin thing must go.
Last reason is we're in a downtrend.  It will stop when it stops but right now the direction is clearly down.  It will probably stop when it starts looking cheap to people...  I'm not sure when that is but that's why I want to get on uBTC right now...  to make a break with the gox past, shake up this negative cloud hanging over us, and make the coin look cheap again at the same time.

It's not realistic right away, but things change.  And things can change quickly.
It's also worth noting bitcoin's downside has been dwarfed by it's huge upside as it has grown over the past several years and businesses that have held bitcoin have had significant windfall profits. This is likely to continue as bitcoin continues its growth IMO.

You're asking to be taken advantage of. There is no easy path to riches or everyone would take it. The best advice is to simply buy bitcoin regularly and stash it away safely in a paper wallet and don't trade it or otherwise touch it. After a few years you'll have a nice chunk of savings in bitcoin and it will have hopefully gone up in value significantly in those few years.

Go research again. You are wrong. The more rapidly money changes hands (higher velocity) the lower the value of the money.  Low velocity happens in deflations and makes currency worth more. In a hyperinflation velocity basically goes to the moon and value of money collapses.  Go look at the formula for calculating money velocity, solve for P (price) and notice how changes in velocity effect price.

Price is set where ever two market agents agree on a price when making an exchange.  Centralized electronic exchanges are a convenient place to exchange and discover price, but they aren't the only way.  Such exchanges have problems, especially when it comes to exchanging unique foundational monetary assets like gold and bitcoin.  It's not philosophically sound for a decentralized foundational money (either gold or bitcoin) to be priced on a centralized exchange or to be priced by paper derivatives.  
I have high hopes for the coming decentralized exchanges.

That's not certain in the least.  Those are the guys who manipulate gold (the monetary asset bitcoin was modeled after) arguably to keep the price low and the asset largely unused so the dollar stays strong.  They would probably do the same to bitcoin and for the same reasons and more.  Bitcoin, if it catches on, is a big threat to banks and wall street (much more than gold ever was).  They will not let it catch on if they can.
I don't think it matters... wall street will do what wall street will do.  And I think bitcoin will grow regardless of them.  But the point in my opinion remains: wall street and the banks will not be bitcoin's friend. They will try to take control of it or destroy it because it obsoletes them.  They are the trusted centralized systems bitcoin technology replaces with largely free algorithms.  The promise of the hundreds of billions in savings bitcoin makes in the financial system comes out of their profits and reduces their power (and possibly even destroys them eventually).  They have suddenly become the travel agents, newspapers, and record distributors looking at the internet and seeing their entire existence come into question.  Given that do you think they will help bitcoin take off?  Somehow I don't think so.  Watch for them to try to regulate it out of usefulness, or worse.

I think it's hilarious that your first chart is a "straight line" UP.  And if you click "all time" it expands to an exponentially increasing line of transactions.  Transactions are increasing exponentially--bitcoin is being used more and more.  
Transaction volume (in BTC) is falling because as bitcoin becomes worth more it takes less bitcoin volume to move more value.  What once took 1 bitcoin to move in value now only takes a tiny fraction of a bitcoin.  The chart there is merely a reflection of the increasing value of bitcoin.  If the chart was denominated in dollar value it would be going up not down.  
Bitcoin days destroyed goes down for similar reasons as transaction volume previously described coupled with the fact as price drops people start to hoard coins instead of spending them as they feel they are being undervalued by the market. 
But really I'm surprised there is as much spending of bitcoin as there is.  In my mind it should be acting like gold: lying very still transaction-wise, moving into strong hands and being hoarded against an uncertain future.  As fiat continues to decline bitcoin will become harder and harder to get as it is hoarded (as will gold and anything else of real value).  Of course bitcoin being hoarded is not a reflection of lack of demand, in fact just the opposite.

Up until the 1970's gold was the basis of the entire world's financial system and its history of being used as money goes back thousands of years.  Since the world went off gold in the early 1970's the market cap of gold hasn't kept up with the increases in the global fiat money supply so really gold's market cap is quite low compared to what it once was.  
Though it hasn't gone up much in value it hasn't diminished either because its still held around the world by countries and central banks as a primary base monetary asset.  Its long history as a monetary asset is a more solid basis than any arbitrary floating fiat that can be printed at whim.  Long after governments and their fiats change, devalue, fail, etc.  gold still exists the same as it ever was.  Governments, banks, the IMF, etc. all know this.

Litecoin must fail for the success of bitcoin.  The reason why is a current argument against bitcoin is bitcoin cannot work long term because it's easy to make alternate coins that can replace it.  For this argument to fail it is necessary that altcoins fail (including litecoin).  If multiple altcoins end up viable then no crypto is viable as there will be a valid argument that any coin might be replaced by some future coin.

It's not that I don't want free and easy exchange between bitcoin and fiat,  I don't expect free and easy exchange to ever really exist. Certainly it won't exist in countries with currency issues like Argentina where the government has capital controls in place and will try to prevent it.  In more secure countries I expect the current difficulties to continue (notice how few exchanges there are?) and probably get worse as regulation picks up to protect fiat and the established system from bitcoin.  It will probably be allowed to exist as an exotic commodity investment of some sort, but as a competing, anonymous currency with instant p2p global exchange? No way they let that connect to the existing fiat system easily.  I'm being a realist, bitcoin will need to succeed without getting support from fiat systems and probably being outright attacked/outlawed.

The intriguing comparison is bitcoin to gold, not bitcoin to credit cards.  Bitcoin has better tax rates than gold, is easier to store, has lower transfer and storage costs, can be used online, etc.  
Bitcoin is like gold but better--it's digital gold.  Now why someone might want gold over credit credit cards is a different story.  You'd probably want both as they are good for different things.  Bottom line is most of the newer folks here don't understand gold, and if you don't understand gold you won't likely understand bitcoin.  If particular if you can't articulate why you would want gold, you'll be confused about why you would want bitcoin.

The debt is offset by collateral, that's all you're saying. It does not support the money, it offsets the debt . That's a non-point in relation to the subject the post is about. The money still needs something else to support it even if it's just the blind confidence of the public like with today's dollar. Your original comment was way overstated. In no way can loan collateral be compared to what gold used to do for the dollar...  heck an economy with commodity backed money has banks and loans too and nobody would make the mistake to say it was the loan collateral that supported the commodity money.

You're one of those dopes that doesn't know when to admit they don't have a clue. The formula mathematically describes the relationships between the variables. According to the formula price can fall due to an increase in money supply or velocity or both.  The formula mathematically shows that if velocity increases, all else remaining the same, price MUST mathematically fall. It doesn't matter what your silly opinion on the matter is, it's an equality, that's the relationship between those parameters. That's what the formula MEANS, period. If you disagree you have to argue why the formula is wrong (and good luck with that).

You are wrong. Real worker pay topped out in the sixties and has been falling ever since.  Government (and other nonproductive areas of our economy like finance) are much larger over that 50 years as the money has gone there while manufacturing and other productive areas have been gutted.  Ordinary American family has needed two workers to get by since then and now even that isn't enough.  Our country, middle class, and economy are in decline and the government control of and destruction of our economic foundation (our money) is why.

And you are wrong IMO.  You have this false notion in your mind that value = use, and use is only selling. Holding bitcoin is as valid a use as selling for product, and more valid when it comes to setting price. Value is not use, it's the price of an object that must be reached to entice holders of the object to sell. Selling at undervalued prices does not increase value, it lowers it. These prices do not entice me to sell, and if everyone thought the same price would be much higher.
Besides, the future you are trying to create in your post already arrived. Bitcoin is already useful for consumer purchases, even paypal can see that. The time to invest for that was a couple years ago when it wasn't so obvious.  The future to look forward to now is something altogether different.

The volume of gold trading in various instruments (ETFs, london exchange, forex, comex futures, derivatives, etc.) is significantly higher than the amount of gold that actually exists for trade.  It's even worse for silver.  These financial products create an artificial (and centralized) trading pool of whatever the underlying commodity is that has little relation to the actual supply/demand dynamics of the underlying commodity.  In the case of gold price is set by a private group of bankers in a closed room a couple times a day (and it's now being investigated for price manipulation).
It might seem impossible that hundreds of billions might soon be trading in "bitcoin" when in reality there are only 6 billion in bitcoins that exist...  or that price might one day be set by a private room of banking interests...  but that's how these things can go.  We'll have to see if people are stupid enough to let it get to that point.  They did with gold.

Debt wouldn't cease to exist, but money wouldn't be debt based.  The issue is a dollar is not an asset like gold or a bitcoin, it's a unit of debt. Rather than being mined into existence a dollar was borrowed into existence. When you put a dollar in a bank it is loaned out making even more dollars (the dollar you have plus the newly loaned dollar) and there is no way to tell how many times that has happened because a dollar owed 100 times over looks the same as a dollar owed once over). A bitcoin or gold coin on the other hand are actual assets. If you have one it is an actual asset of value, it wasn't loaned into existence and is Not merely a note saying someone owes you an asset. No banks silently create more of them by loaning new ones into existence. Any entity that claims to hold your bitcoin but really loans it out behind your back is committing fraud and and can be discovered by blockchain audit techniques.
In a world using bitcoin debt would still exist because people could always loan out bitcoin, but these loans would be visible to all--people that were loaning bitcoin would know they no longer had their bitcoin because they loaned it. Such a loan doesn't create more bitcoin. A bitcoin is very different than a piece of paper saying someone owes you a bitcoin.  With the dollar, there is no difference because a dollar is always a piece of paper that says someone owes someone something--and more are created constantly. The really hilarious thing is the dollar is an IOU on an asset that was defaulted on in the 70's. It's a promise for payment that was broken decades ago but people still wander around using them like they mean something when they don't. People don't even know what assets vs. IOUs are anymore as shown by your question. 
TL;DR: bitcoins are actual assets of value. Dollars are tokens of debt, an IOU, a claim on some supposed asset (made a hundred times over and actually defaulted on in the 70's). This distinction makes it clear where the debts are and where the assets are for everyone. You either have bitcoin or you have an IOU for bitcoin, the two aren't confused together like with the dollar.

You absolutely do need a certain number of value associated with "square feet" to use bitcoin.  It's not arbitrary, it's related to the value of transactions made and the total ownership.  To perform certain sorts of transactions requires a certain amount of "square feet" of bitcoin depending on value of the land.  For example to sell a professional sports team for 2 billion dollars worth of bitcoin using a currency whose entire "land" value is only 5 billion total is not realistically possible.  Bitcoin would have to be orders of magnitude more valuable to be useful performing that real world example transaction.  Keep in mind most of the land at any time is merely sitting there owned and not able to be used in transactions.

The names on the gospels were not on the original documents, they were added by the early church.  Nobody knows who wrote the gospels.  And as I said before Josephus didn't write the few phrases about Jesus now found associated with his writings.  They are forgeres written by some unknown Christian. The stories of how the disciples died are legends of the early church, not settled history (and regardless don't mean anything, every religion has martyrs; people die for lies all the time).  The bible stories themselves are fantastical, supernatural stories that are clearly legendary... made up as oral legend by a superstitious people and later written down.  They are FICTION not history.

Yes, anyone that has bought in the last few months is down.  That's a very short timeframe.  Anyone that has bought in longer than that is ahead and again has held the best investment on the planet for the past few years, period.
As for falling demand, look at any longer term chart and that's simply nonsense.  Bitcoin is growing like nothing else on the planet.  Don't let completely normal short term price fluctuations distract you from the long term move.  Bitcoin is growing like fucking crazy and I feel incredibly lucky to have been born at the right time and with the right knowledge to be participating.  As a detractor you've been wrong for years.

Bitcoin is an improvement over our current system, though perhaps many people (like you) don't understand why and how yet.  It was the same back in the 90's when people like Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman didn't think the internet would have as great an impact as the Fax.  (and continuing on his bad predictions, he has a dim view of bitcoin as well).
@_date: 2014-10-18 20:04:20
They did it for a number of reasons that don't apply to bitcoin. Gold has many limitations that make it difficult to actually use as money. It's difficult to store, secure, divide, validate, transfer, travel with, etc.  Banks were the solution to those issues and you could even get interest on your deposits.  Of course the result was a history of failed banks, bank runs, etc. Even the US government defaulted on its gold obligations, twice, and eventually outlawed gold and removed it from the money system.  I think it's fair to say that fractional reserve and gold didn't get along. However what lost was gold not banks or fractional reserve. The government was not responsible enough to run a money system with gold as its basis so it chose to remove that basis. People had no say in the matter.
Now bitcoin has come and bitcoin does not have the issues gold had. It's like gold but vastly improved. With bitcoin you don't need a bank to solve the issues of gold, you really can be your own bank. So I don't think fractional reserve bitcoin will ever be a big issue, especially with ideas like proof of reserves and related technologies being invented. This is a new frontier and I don't think it will end up where the old one did.

Many bitcoin early adopters own gold.  An early description of bitcoin was called bitgold.  The comparison to gold is not a problem, it is accurate. 
Transferring and securing actual wealth/property is difficult.  With gold it takes armored cars, guns, vaults, etc.  Bitcoin is a vast improvement.  Bitcoin is actual property, like gold but digital--that's what makes it unique.  Fiat is not property/wealth, it is not difficult to transfer and store.  Fiat  is a very different thing and comparing bitcoin to fiat will always be mismatched and problematic. One is property and the other isn't. Most people don't understand this but this isn't a conversation for most people.  Bitcoin can allow easy use of a gold-like asset so that ordinary people can use it and not need guns and armored cars, but there is still development to do and issues to solve.
Edit: downvotes from people that don't understand bitcoin and gold.  Seems there are more than a few.

I'm talking about making a micro payment, and making an immediate online tip directly to someone without even knowing the first thing about them, and making a programmed payment via a programmable currency, and a half dozen other subtle things happening there that fiat can't do.  And no you didn't need to meet someone in a parking lot, you don't even know me and received value from me you can send to someone else (or if it was more you could buy something directly from an ever expanding list of merchants).  The whole idea that you somehow have to exchange bitcoin to fiat is nonsense.  I've never converted bitcoin to fiat in the years I've been using it and I probably never will.  


I don't hold my bitcoins in my laptop.  But even if I did and my laptop got stolen bitcoins can be easily and securely backed up and retrieved (try doing that with cash or gold)--so thanks for another example of how bitcoin is better.  As for why I'd want to, why not?  The point is I could with bitcoin (assuming I had 10 million heh) and it's difficult to impossible with fiat.  Bitcoins exist everywhere so everywhere someone with bitcoin goes, their bitcoins essentially go with them safely and securely--no asking permission from anyone.  


The market decides bitcoin's value, just as it does with dollars, yen, euros, gold and any other money (and most other things).  The difference is there isn't an *additional* someone in the middle printing more, manipulating the value, controlling where it goes and who can use it, etc. like there is with fiat.  If you think an authority controlling money is so great and its not the market really deciding value in the end, try to convince people in Russia, Argentina, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Cyprus, Iceland, or any of the dozens of places around the world where fiat has failed or been devalued in the last few decades (including in the US if you go back to the 1930's).
Anyway I think I answered your question what bitcoin offers over fiat even if you'd rather not hear it.

Mentioning blockchain.info like they did just makes them sound incompetent. They can't do anything themselves... dependent on an external website for basic tracking of transactions... it's a disgrace. 
I fully expect more delays and any eventual access to withdraw bitcoins to have severe delays and limits.  If they actually allowed full withdraw people would try to pull out everything and gox's insolvency would become clear. So one way or another they won't allow that.  Expect further excuses from these incompetent losers.
What they should be doing is announcing how many coins/funds have been stolen (both from hackers and last years government confiscations)...  but I don't think they even know.  The place is run by people in over their heads.  They just keep delaying hoping some miracle happens and they can make enough from commissions and arbitration to bail out their incompetence before the curtain falls.

Try to buy something online with cash and then get back to me.  And how about how the government is stealing money out of your box every year despite not having the key (at rates of 3%-8% of stable countries and much higher for unstable ones).  In order to try to assuage this theft people are forced out of cash and into investments (and thus to systems of trust in 3rd parties just as I said).  It's why nobody actually keeps boxes of cash around for any long periods.
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:33:39
Base money is created from thin air and is not backed or collateralized by anything (except arguably the US government's ability to tax in the money which creates demand for the money, though that is not the same thing as backing). Loans from the banking system are collateralized as you describe but again that's not really backing. The cascading defaults of 2008 showed the stark difference between having an asset and having an IOU while the trillions in base money created since the crisis has expanded the base money that exists with no collateral many times over. The whole thing rests on the US government and rule of law and I don't know if you've noticed but rule of law and respect for the US are on significant decline lately especially when it comes to finance. How can anyone trust rule of law when rules are ignored by banks  (e.g. scandals of naked shorting, libor, rehypothecation of customer fundss, etc.) and dismissed by government when it's convenient (e.g. bailouts, bail-ins, money printing, etc.)?  Sorry but you can keep your rule of law based money system, we can see it fails exactly when it's needed most--I'll hold real assets like bitcoin that can't have the rules changed or broken by banks and government  when it's convenient for them. Foreign countries like China, Russia, India, etc. seem to be thinking the same thing lately as they are all setting up trade agreements that bypass the dollar for the first time in decades.

The idea that bitcoin somehow has to be used in everyday consumer transactions to be successful I think is a misnomer.  It's nice that bitcoin can be used that way, particularly by people that don't have access to credit cards, but I think in the end bitcoin is something altogether different and more important than just another payment system.

You are clueless.  A lump of gold is unambigously owned, just like a bitcoin private key. You can easily know if you hold gold or hold a gold debt--one is gold one isn't. Same with bitcoin--one is a bitcoin private key, one isn't.  One is money, one is a debt, a claim to someone else's money.

Sure. Uncle Sam's funny money isn't actual property (digital or not), it's just "stuff" you get to keep if the authorities say you do. They can take it away from whoever they wish, print trillions more, basically do whatever they want with it. So yeah getting it back after it's stolen is no big deal... but I'd rather have actual property I control rather than them, so I prefer bitcoin. There is freedom and responsibility required with having to control your own property rather than have some authority do it for you.

Sorry but it's not mathematically possible to counterfeit bitcoin (as one example) because of how it is defined mathematically.

Right, because a piece of paper is the same as a lump of gold.  I mean everyone in the world and down through history recognizes that piece of paper with the pretty pictures on it and lettering, they recognize it's worth as money innately. Absolutely no difference between the metal used for thousands of years and across cultures as highly valued money and the slip of paper with the "federal reserve note" label on it. Nothing odd about your statement at all.  Heh.

A deed is not property, it's a deed to property (same with title).  There is quite a big difference between a house and a deed to a house, right?  But bitcoin IS digital property itself.  It's like storing actual gold on the cloud (not a title to gold, gold ITSELF).  That has never been done before.  It has its own unique advantages and issues.

The original base money was gold.  Now base money is paper, but it is still brought into existence out of nothing via government selling debt.

Read the article I linked. Value is in the mind of the holders. Price of an object is the value that is high enough to entice holders to give up their object. These current prices are ridiculously low and I will not give up my coins at these prices without significant discounts. If the reality of how markets work bother you, there is nothing I can do about that.  Holding is as valid a market action as spending and it is the action that sets value, if you think bitcoin is undervalued you show it holding not spending.

You're equating short-term transaction growth with the long term growth of bitcoin.  Longer term bitcoin is clearly growing even in transaction count.  And in the short term bitcoin is growing by a large number of measures (wallet count, value of transactions, merchants who take it, etc.).  I don't see a problem with bitcoin growth at all.  I've explained why I'm surprised at the number of bitcoin transactions considering I seldom transact in bitcoin.  That is not a reflection of a decline in bitcoin but rather the nature of bitcoin IMO.
As for bitcoin working better than existing choices clearly it has advantages and has the promise of further advantages to come.  Right now it's better for moving money around the world (both to travel with and to send quicker and cheaper to foreign countries).  It's not politically and financially manipulated nor printed like the dollar is.  It can't be confiscated, "clawed back," or frozen. 
But really I don't think the true value of bitcoin has been understood by people in countries like the USA that have a generally decent government and relatively secure financial system (for the moment).  The value of bitcoin will become abundantly clear in time as those advantages we have now degrade and/or outright collapse.  Then, like the peoples of Argentina or Iceland, we'll discover quite quickly what has value and what doesn't and why.  It's basically digital gold and has similar properties and uses as gold--people that don't understand gold won't get bitcoin...  until they're forced to by declining financial circumstance.

I already acknowledged the potential of competing systems.  More power to them if any appears and can over take Bitcoin's lead.  In the meantime, my money would be on the current dominant leader.  Right now there's not even a realistic alternative, you're just making up suppositions from thin air (sort of like how the money you want to bet on is created).
As for profiting from "doing nothing", I'd say risking an investment on a highly speculative invention is not "nothing."  Do you even understand how our system works?

A large move up will eventually pull back.  You're cherry picking a time period to made a point that is the opposite of the truth.  On a longer time frame than your cherry picked period, anyone who has bought bitcoin in the last several years has made absurd returns.

The reality is bitcoin has had the best investment returns of anything I've ever seen.  Silly people like you want to try to spin that negatively.  You might as well cherry pick a period Apple had bad returns and claim it's been a terrible investment--that would make as much sense.

Do you think killing an innocent thing for the crimes of another is moral?  Do you think a god is out there who demands a murder before he can decide to forgive humanity for being as he makes us?  Do you think it's moral to punish people forever in hell if there isn't the proper sort of murder or if people don't "believe in" that murder being for their "sins"?  Really?

I'm no lawyer but for those of you that think this is irrelevant, maybe the case of IRS stepped up cost basis applies here.
Basically if a relative dies and leaves you a house or stocks the cost basis of that property that you are responsible for paying capital gains taxes against is reset to the market value of the property on the day of the relative's death.  
This is HUGE for real estate, stocks, etc. that have had significant appreciation during the relative's lifetime--**it basically means the capital gains taxes owed from all past value gains of the property during the life of the relative are forgotten and never have to be paid.**  It would be nice if such a thing applied to bitcoin, and I don't see why it wouldn't.  Basically it's tax free bitcoin gains for the decedents of hoarders who held bitcoins as a store of value through their life and made significant gains.

Jesus said what?  Oh, did he?  Actually we don't know what Jesus said.  There is no book of Jesus.  For all the trouble the Christian god supposedly went through to become a man and have himself killed as a human sacrifice, he didn't bother to write one single word to anyone.  All we have are anonymously written gosples that nobody knows who even wrote, claiming Jesus said things.  So maybe what you meant to say was some guy, though we don't know who exactly, wrote decades after Jesus supposedly died that Jesus said "I am the truth." And to that I say, so what. There are a lot of old writings that make a lot of ridiculous and superstitious claims that aren't likely to be true.  I don't believe nonsense like that just because someone put together some old writings in a book and claimed it to be truth.  Reasonable people have higher standards for what they believe than that.

Sure, a loan contract is created.  But it's not money.  It's not bitcoin.  The loan is at best a money substitute.
The system has changed over the decades.  It used to be that gold was an active part of the financial system.  Gold was money and the utlimate extingisher of debt.  Debts used to eventually get paid off and they would get paid off by gold money.  Gold was the apex of the money pyramid, and lower forms of money and money substitutes were under it.  As the system aged that broke down, gold was removed and debt took its place.  There is no basis to our system today--debt expands continually and is never paid off.  Many people think the system we're on will eventually collapse.  But regardless if that's true or not it's difficult to understand bitcoin because nobody teaches about the kind of money bitcoin (and gold) is anymore.

The ECB has been managing the Euro money supply.  Just because they're not doing what you think they should be doing doesn't mean they aren't managing the money supply.  You say they should be doing X, someone else says they should be doing Y, someone else wants Z...  it's impossible to correctly manage a money supply and that's my point.
It wouldn't be any better if they'd kept and managed their own currencies...  it would just be a different set of problems at different times (and probably would've hit crisis levels even earlier).
"Managing" a market just means some authority pick the winners and losers rather than letting those in the market decide who wins and loses for themselves based on legitimate economic worthiness. It's inherently unfair/corrupt and worse causes distortions that damage the economy--damaging distortions that don't happen in a free market.  People that think you can manage a market and magically turn everyone into winners live in a dream world.  You'd think all the failed managed economies of history would've proven the point, but I guess some people only learn if it happens to them.

If we ever develop a practical free source of energy then yes we might be able to restructure society somehow such that work is optional.  Note that that's not a trivial problem even with unlimited free energy.  And even with unlimited energy there would still be limited resources like living space, oxygen, etc.  But for now the issue is moot as energy and resources are limited and so both morally and practically effort/work/production is the best way we've discovered to distribute those limited resources.
As for basic income, if it were implemented in my country I'd leave and take my resources and production with me.  If I was prohibited from leaving I'd stop working, let someone else support me and my family, and wait for the inevitable collapse (after which I'd help rebuild society and perhaps help execute the idiots who destroyed it in the first place).

It's good to get a big name like paypal for the sake of legitimacy, but now bitcoin is becoming lopsided. This whole thing is just another way to sell bitcoin for dollars--something that has already been booming this year. What we need is more and easier ways to obtain and actually use bitcoin end-to-end, not just more ways to extract dollars from bitcoin's market cap to buy stuff with.  I'm not complaining about the exposure but in the end bitcoin replaces paypal (and the dollar for that matter), it doesn't need paypal.  I see OpenBazaar as much more important for bitcoin right now than this paypal stuff.

Right.  But there are other wrinkles...  such as the exchanges that everyone looks to for bitcoin price don't actually exchange bitcoins--they exchange bitcoin debts/derivatives. Bitcoin derivatives are not bitcoin and under many circumstances they won't be priced the same.  (Anyone that thinks bitcoins on an exchange are the same as actual bitcoins needs only to talk to victims of MtGox about the difference).  
Forthcoming distributed bitcoin exchanges have the opportunity of being rather unique...  they can trade actual bitcoin and will be a good place to set price.

Economies are not consciously engineered.  They are complex social constructs that evolve over time.  They are certainly not engineered by governments, they evolve from actors participating in the market.  Governments are a part of that but are unique from the other market actors in that governments aren't motivated as the other market actors. They don't participate from profit motive and supply/demand dynamics, they are outside the market and tend to mess it up.  Markets evolve and work despite governments (most the time, sometimes governments completely destroy their markets).

The banks are lending it... they're lending it back to the Fed.  This is done on purpose to keep they money in the banking system rather than let it out to the public where it might cause general inflation.  The process of keeping the money in the banking system is called sterilization. It's why the financial system booms and everything else stagnates... because that's the goal, believe it or not.

Deflation is mainly a problem for debt-based money. Systems like the dollar that have expanded massively via fractional reserve and other debt expansion mechanisms in the economy can literally implode from deflation.  This failing of fiat is what is really behind the fear of deflation our current money masters have. They can never let the dollar or other fiat deflate, they must always keep inflation going and the debt expanding (even to outright printing) to keep the current debt pyramid functioning.
Bitcoin is not debt based. It does not implode if it occasionally gets horded and rises in value, it just goes up in value until it reaches a level where savings are again dishoarded. Yes wages paid in bitcoin will have to occasionally drop, so what, as bitcoin wages are now priced in dollars or other fiat (and are likely to remain that way for a long while) it happens automatically with no "wage stickiness" problem. If bitcoin wages ever become priced in bitcoin people will understand they will have to occasionally drop because that's what they've always done.
TL;DR: deflation is only a problem for fiat. Wage stickiness is not a problem for bitcoin.

We've been through this before.  I wasted my time then, and I guess I'll waste it again, for at least one more comment anyway.  The Yen hasn't experienced hyper-inflation (yet) because Japan's deficit levels aren't high enough yet (neither are ours btw).  As long as a country's debts and spending haven't become completely out of control there is still room for things to get worse before the self reenforcing negative feedback loops associated with hyperinflation kick in.  There is time to save the currency for both the US and Japan...  but that's unlikely to happen as it would take the sort of political will that doesn't exist.

As price rises spending will take care of itself. You can't "fool" the market into thinking bitcoin is useful by spending it. The market is smarter than that. Bitcoin has value, it is useful and will continue to become more useful as market cap rises. Bitcoin eventually will be more used than it is today--intelligent, forward-looking market participants recognize that and invest, and hold until their expectations are met.  That is what makes price rise, not people selling trying to create some false sense of future value today.

Bitcoin isn't a bubble either, but the author either doesn't understand that or doesn't want it known. In particular bitcoin has a few properties that make it violate the [law of demand]( With bitcoin demand can increase as price increases and vice versa. This is because (1) bitcoin becomes more useful and valuable the more people buy/use it due to the network effect, and (2) like the gold bitcoin was modelled after, it is likely a [Veblen good]( (a good whose demand can rise with price).

Bitcoin is useful for its ability to give direct control of assets and keep them away from those that would control, debase or outright steal them, its ability to travel with money without restriction, ability to move money anywhere trivially without restriction, as a store of value, etc. Bitcoin will be great for "out of system" markets, world-wide remittances, for the unbanked, for storage of wealth outside the system, for programmable contracts, for large transactions between millionaires, businesses and small countries that bypass the governments that control the banking systems etc. Of course bitcoin has a lot of growing up to do before it reaches that potential.
OpenBazaar is an "out of system" market, meaning it's not regulated, doesn't use the banking system, has open participation, etc.  It is literally a free market--something most people in the US have never seen.  Bitcoin works in that world, credit cards do not.  I'm not sure how big such a free market will be, but my guess is it will be huge.

With the competitive nature of bitcoin mining coupled with the "tech arms race" nature of it, I expect that at some point there will be a "winner."

This will be a continuing problem now that mining can't be done profitably by ordinary people.  It's a bomb waiting to go off.

The fraud aspect of banking is the guarantee of return of your funds on demand (i.e. demand deposits) when that is impossible except if only a few people ask for their funds at once.  In any other business that sort of thing is illegal...  but the banking system has special privileges.
And no, bitcoin does not act like fiat.  Fiat is entirely based on trust in a 3rd party, a government, which you depend on controlling the amount/value of the currency.  Bitcoin is not run that way and its value is determined by the market.  They are nothing alike.

"spend it all in one transaction"?
Maybe there is some confusion about bitcoin transactions?  There is no other choice with a bitcoin transaction except to "spend it all."  You cannot send only a partial number of coins from an address in a transaction; all coins are sent.  The transaction amount is sent to the receiving address and the rest go to a "change address."  Normally that "change address" is a new address in the wallet, but with some wallets that "change address" can be the original sending address (but some people think reusing an address like that is bad for security and anonymity reasons).
Change addresses are one of the more misunderstood issues with bitcoin.  People have lost large amounts of bitcoin spending from paper wallets because they didn't understand the issues with change addresses and how they are handled in various wallets.

No, it merely creates demand for the money as long as the government remains reasonably solvent and in power. Taxes cannot guarantee value of fiat in any long term sense as the hundreds of now failed and valueless fiat currencies of history show..When certain solvency limits are reached (e.g. when government debt and budget deficits go high enough) with a country that is actively printing, the money fails, taxes or no. Also if the government fails somehow (war, revolution, etc.) its fiat tends to fail with it. And given how short the lifespan of some governments that's not much of a value "guarantee" either. 
As a final note even solvent governments can devalue or otherwise change a fiat money system as they wish (e.g. the US dollar devaluation in the 30's), again not much of a guarantee for citizens that have to use the fiat. Bottom line is there is no value guarantee for fiat and looking at the hundreds of failed fiats of history the lifespan of fiat tends to be quite short (on the order of a few decades).

From the chapter abstracts also on that site:
Chapter 10 – Endgames: Inflationary Meltdown or Return to Hard Money?
Abstract: The present fiat money system has already accumulated substantial imbalances, among them excessive levels of debt and distorted asset markets. All major central banks have adopted extreme policies to avoid collapse. The choice is now between a continuation of present policies, which will ultimately lead to hyperinflation, or a return to hard money. **This chapter charts the path to currency collapse, which appears likely, but also discusses three potential hard money alternatives: a return to a gold standard; the separation of state and money (de-politicization of money); the rise of free market money and crypto-currencies (Bitcoin).**

You don't know what you're talking about.  Forex traders trade currency pairs going long one currency with respect to another every day--this is basically the same thing someone does if they buy bitcoin with dollars and then later trade back for dollars (they expect bitcoin to rise in value against the value of the dollar during the time they hold bitcoin).  This is what currency trading is--I'm not sure why you think its stupid other than you don't understand it.  And yes, the value of bitcoin comes from those that accumulate it--you say it like it's a bad thing but that's exactly how any money gets its value.
In the case of bitcoin we have a very unique money...  you have a money that has recently been born, hasn't caught on yet, and has unique properties unlike any other money that exists.  The potential upside on bitcoin is huge, much bigger than with any other currency (though it obviously has very high risks too).

This is true but it requires a strong economy and debt put in good productive loans.  We don't have either; we are simply printing more to pay past debt and to float the economy, government, and financial system another day hoping things get better tomorrow. 
We are speeding faster and faster through dense fog towards a sheer cliff. Nobody knows when we go over (and those in charge don't believe the road will end) but it's getting closer every day. The measure of how close we're getting is hinted at by continually worsening debt to GNP ratio and climbing budget deficit.  These measures do have limits and at some point the system will fail and the usual result is the failure of the currency being printed and the economy running on it.  It's shocking that we're doing exactly what history shows us will destroy our money and economy.

Even legitimate short selling is B.S. at it's root.  It works by pooling customer assets (in this case bitcoin) within the exchange and then letting customers borrow other customer's coins and sell them.  You think you bought coins and are holding long and strong but the exchange gave them to someone else who then sold them and you get to watch the price fall as you "hold coins" long (really you are holding an internal IOU from the shorter).  This is "legitimate" shorting.  
With naked shorting they don't bother to borrow the coins they "sell," they just pull new coin from thin air and sell it on the exchange.  Both forms of shorting can't happen on the blockchain, shorting requires a centralized exchange where actual "ownership" of coin is nebulous and you can't tell an IOU from actal coins

Actually foreign denominated debts are only one possible aspect--fiat currencies have failed in history without foreign denominated debt being an issue.  Two key factors in a country that is currently printing its own currency determined by study of 29 cases of recent hyperinflation by Bernholz were found to be: a high debt to GNP ratio (over 80%) coupled with a high budget deficit (over 40% of government spending).  The US levels of debt are already over the critical level and budget deficit is nearly at critical levels.  These are not magic numbers that immediately mean hyperinflation when breached, but they are significant levels where historically hyperinflations have become extremely likely.  But really ask yourself is debt going to suddenly reverse in any significant way?  Is government spending going to magically drop when all it does is rise?  We both know the answer to those questions.  It might take a decade or two but the dollar is totally fucked.

The unemployment rate is heavily politicized and manipulated (e.g. people that are unemployed long enough simply drop off it).  Look at the Employment to Population Ratio numbers (no recovery since 2008) or Labor Force Participation Rates (at 36 year lows) to see the distress in employment (notice the other lesson here is the government is systematically lying to you with headline numbers):
Here is the unemployment rate as calculated by a private party in a way to remove the publicly known modifications added to the data since 1994 to make unemployment look better. Notice unemployment has gone up during the "recovery" by this measure.
Median household income is trending down and has been since about 1999 (steeper since 2007)--see chart here:
Also net worth has plunged--the typical household is now worth 36% less than it was a decade ago--the middle class is dying:
"The fraction of families that owned a privately held business fell 1.6 percentage points between 2010 and 2013, to 11.7 percent. This level is the lowest ever recorded..."  See Box 9 here:
Do I see economic indicators that are cause for distress?  Didn't I just mention several?  And I could go on and on.  The middle class is dying.  We're years into a so called recovery and it is the worst "recovery" on record (unless you're a bank or one percenter) while having the most stimulus ever thrown at it.  
It doesn't bother you that we're printing TRILLIONS of dollars since 2008--the same sort of bullshit that has destroyed dozens of fiat based financial systems the last hundred years--and we have nothing to show for it but greater wealth disparity?  Look at this chart... this is the monetary base--the money foundation of our economy and they've sent it print-happy berserk since 2008 (which is why the stock market is rising, not for any economic reason):

Our money is inflating rather than deflating as it naturally would due to gains from productivity, etc. This inflation is artificial and actually takes a significant amount of value from the population every year and redistributes it to the government and those closest to the inflation source (the financial sector). It acts like a stealth tax on holders of the currency. I don't think anything there is controversial even if most people are unaware.

That might be true.  And again it is a very interesting proposition.  The best thing about it is that it suggests there is actually a fix.
Unfortunately as far as fiat goes, I don't see a fix.  Even if we fixed vote buying the monetary course we've been put on is likely to run its course until it outright fails.  That's where bitcoin comes in.  Bitcoin might be a safe path through the monetary chaos that is coming.
Also note that the "nixon shock" was only one step in a long path toward fiat that included events like gold confiscation in 1933 and the creation of the Fed and income tax in 1913 (and modifications to the constitution to allow that change).  Actually the events in 1913 were critical to the later capture/corruption of the money system and government...  not sure how that fits with your theory.  Clearly something was already broken even back then and it ties to banks and the money system not voting rules.

So you don't care about the price drop because for the most part you sold your bitcoin. And you expect to buy them back at some point when it moves up.  Sounds easy... be in cash when price is falling and be in coin when price is rising. And no doubt many people have sold thinking the same thing (and that adds to bitcoin's down-trend).  But that kind of trading is not easy. It seems easy, especially at times like now when price has been falling, but it's not easy. You plan to stop selling when price rises, and if others do that it will be difficult to get coins when price is rising (which can be extremely fast). In the past that's exactly what we've seen... big price moves and difficulty getting coins. Which comes back to my point it's difficult to trade as you suggest.  I guess people will do what they will do and discover from experience what doesn't work well. But when price is rising and people are complaining they can't get coins I will say it was easy to get coins earlier when price was down to flat, you should have got some then.
I predict those that buy on lulls after big price drops and hold long term will do better than those that try to trade. I also predict people will look back a year from now and wonder why they were selling now rather than buying. Markets are perverse, the best time to buy is when nobody wants to buy.

That is incorrect.  The institution of fiat in China probably existed that long but no single fiat currency came close to lasting that long.  Fiat was created in China in the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) with the Chao.  It failed and was replaced in 1287 and continued to have inflation problems until the end of the Dynasty.  The next dynasty tried to use fiat with similar rapid inflations with notes being suspended in 1450.  The history of fiat continues like that with new fiat currencies being introduced and then failing a short time later.  You can read some of the history here:
If you still want to hold to your assertion maybe you could tell us what the currency supposedly was and what years it supposedly existed so I can look it up and show you how you're wrong.  Or you could look it up yourself and discover you're wrong yourself.

The cherrypicking is being done by the government. Anyone who has to actually pay for food, energy, schooling, medical,etc. knows inflation is nowhere near 3%, or even 8%!  You are living in a fantasyland of manipulation and denial.  The truth will be obvious even to you in the next few years or so when either velocity picks up and the damage done by money creation comes into full view, or worse velocity doesn't pick up and we continue to make the eventual problem even worse.  In the meantime save your BS for other blind nitwit economists who are the only ones too stupid to see the reality staring them in the face. 
Also keep in mind we're not talking about the same things.  You're talking about regular inflation with its wage spirals and manageable expectations,  I'm talking about the death of a currency--the failure of the system itself.

At this early stage bitcoin's "killer app" is bitcoin, but that's not obvious to most people (in my opinion because  most people don't understand hard money).  With bitcoin basically someone invented digital gold which has been selling at a huge discount from its potential value because few people recognize it for what it is.  It's like there is gold sitting there for a few dollars an oz and yet people are looking for an "app" for the gold or for how to trade to riches with it (and losing it in the process) because they don't understand why and how the gold itself is valuable. 
Like the OP says, slow down.  Pick up some digital gold, recognize it for what it is, put it away somewhere safe (just like you would with real gold).  Wait for the market recognition of what bitcoin is to mature.  Maybe that will eventually include some "app" that uses the gold, but who knows--the sure thing is the gold itself.  The trick is to avoid all the bullcrap pitfalls and thieves that want your gold and simply make it through the maturation process with your gold.
If you disagree, bully for you. I think I have the right view and it's served me very well since the day I discovered bitcoin and recognized what it was.  I bet I've done better than 99% of people in bitcoin simply by keeping my view on bitcoin itself and basically doing nothing (beyond keeping it as safe as possible, just like I would if it were gold, which it basically is).
If you prefer you can replace "gold" above in the post with "land/real estate" and get the same jist.

Sure they'll have the private keys, just like brokers have stock certificates and commodity houses have some physical gold.  Of course its perfectly legal for brokers to let traders borrow other people's shares and sell them (otherwise known as going short) and the result is now the same stock share has several entities who think they own it.  And that's just the simplest example many people already know about.
Taking assets and turning them into debts and loaning them out multiple times over is what Wall Street and banks DO--it's key to their business model and they're very good at it.  The company's own assets for these business are leveraged 5, 10, even 30 to 1.  That means for every asset the firm holds, there are 30 people who think they have a legal right to it.  That's why they have to be bailed out when things go bad, to prevent the cascading defaults that would happen from this leveraged, intertwined mess.
So we'll see what happens over the next several years but here's my prediction.  These firms will find many entirely legal (and perhaps a few less than legal) ways to turn their bitcoins into debt-paper "bitcoins" that have no blockchain restrictions and can be loaned out again and again just like with dollars, gold, stocks, and every other asset wall street touches.  The claims on these wall street "bitcoins" will be many times more than actual bitcoins that exist, just like happened with gold.  Then we can all sit around wondering why the 21 million bitcoins that exist are so cheap when really wall street has manufactured as many paper "bitcoins" as they want and sold them to the world, just like they did with gold.  And almost nobody will understand what happened (you and most posters here on reddit being good examples of that) and the few that do won't care.
If you buy one of these structured products rather than just buying a bitcoin outright, you're part of the problem.  The CEO of Overstock would support me here I think, he's been complaining about similar things for years.

If you want to trade, go ahead and trade.  I don't expect anything I say to stop anyone.
But the reality is the majority of traders will lose money.  If you're one of the majority that will lose, leverage increases your losses.  Leverage also makes it more likely that you will lose because of the way it amplifies losses and works your emotions and the way it stresses your position during rare extreme moves.
If you're going to trade don't even think about margin until you are trading profitably consistently without it.

That's the thing, with bitcoin you don't really need to exchange, you can stay in bitcoin. Gold is a good store of wealth but not very good as a means of exchange. Gold has always required authorities/experts to handle validation, fineness, weights, measures... basically coinage. Government was needed in the loop to make gold transferable. Bitcoin's properties make it a better money than gold or fiat without needing a government for anything. Once bitcoin takes off people will rapidly discover there is no need to exchange for fiat (beyond getting fiat to pay taxes). Government is cut out of the loop.

If you believe in bitcoin and are contributing to its rise, it's a very valid comparison. Microsoft was a risky asset too early on  (and still is in many ways).  But really that wasn't my point. My point was to get outsized gains it requires going against traditional investment advice at some point.  Yes, it could bite you, but that's the risk that has to be taken if you want outsized gains. Traditional investment advice will usually grow your wealth over time safely, but you can't make outsized gains with it, period.  Pick any asset that has grown tremendously... to have made a lot of money off it you had to buy it during its growth and hold on even though it becomes a huge (and risky) amount of your net worth. Taking a risk is the cost of doing way above average. 
In the case of bitcoin I'm with the OP and think the reward is highly likely and a large risk is called for. My entire life I've never seen a better opportunity.

What I observe is regulation doesn't stop financial systems failing and people losing money, the papers are full of stuff happening every day (madoff, libor scandal, gold market rigging, money printing, hyperinflation, etc.). If anything the centralization associated with regulation makes things bigger including the eventual blow ups and money losses.  We're looking at entire countries and their financial systems failing now--entire countries! 
I also observe that the new technologies in bitcoin ensure security and safe transfer of this new digital property bitcoin every second of the day and its done anonymously, distributed and trustless. But bitcoin is still new and is being adopted by a population that largely doesn't understand it (you are a perfect example of that).  As a result old style centralized systems like mtgox keep coming up and being used and not surprisingly failing.  The solution to this is not old style accounting and security, it's new technologies along the lines of the technologies that make bitcoin work every day without any old style accounting and security. 
When you understand what bitcoin is it's easy to see where it's going and why.  And it's easy to see who understands bitcoin and who doesn't...  You don't.

Yes, the dollar is more stable than bitcoin--stable falling down in value.  Bitcoin on the other hand is going up during its young growth phase and as it matures will settle down in volatility but will still trend up even as the dollar trends down.

Bitcoin is not anything like current digital fiat money.  Bitcoin is actual digital property.  As real property it can really be owned (and as a result can really be stolen).  Fiat is just accounting...  if someone "steals" digital fiat they can just change some accounting and reassign "ownership" to whoever they want.  Of course the downside of fiat money is you never really own it like you own bitcoin.  They can take it away from you, freeze your funds, reassign it to someone else, etc.  So I guess it depends on what you want.  Do you want real property that is actually yours and yours alone?  Or do you want an accounting of "money" that isn't really yours, but is controlled by someone else and you only have it at their whim?

Yes and no. It's true the real value of bitcoin doesn't come from being a better replacement to credit cards from the US consumer perspective, at least not right away. But it won't be an uphill battle to reach widespread adoption because there is significant global value in bitcoin elsewhere (to the global unbanked for instance that don't have the credit card option). Also merchants will still adopt bitcoin because the costs to adopt are low while rewards high even with the lower number of bitcoin transactions (e.g. they'll make more money off a bitcoin transaction plus they'll get access to a global market including the currently unbanked). In short bitcoin is a higher quality, higher profit, market expanding sort of transaction and merchants will want access to them even to the point of paying discounts.
As bitcoin proves itself merchants will stumble over themselves to get onboard. The real issue is with consumers. Why would consumers use bitcoins when credit cards offer perks and better protections? The answer there has many aspects. For some consumers (the unbanked) they will have little better choices. For others they will give up credit card perks for merchant discounts. Others will prefer the ease and relative anonymity of bitcoin. Others will use bitcoin because they have savings in bitcoin to spend (because bitcoin is going to prove to be a better saving vehicle globally than depreciating fiat). 
Once bitcoin really gets rolling a lot of spending in bitcoin will be business oriented because the spenders will be in globally connected supply chains that run primarily on bitcoin. It will be the fastest, cheapest, most secure option for that sort of spending. Business is going to LOVE bitcoin both at the consumer end and the supply chain end.

Nice response.  I'm a computer scientist with a long standing interest in economics, money systems and trading.  I was aware of bitcoin early on but didn't think it would go anywhere because I didn't think anyone would use it.  When people started to use it and it's price shot up from nothing to over $30 I figured people would cash out and the price would crash back to zero and die.  Price did crash and I congratulated myself for being right but something unexpected happened... it didn't die.  Price bottomed out under $10 while other growth indicators like wallet usage continued to grow.  Next thing I know someone from the Fed is calling it a ponzi and if the fed is worried enough to attack it, it's for real.  That's when I started studying in detail and dipped a toe in.  I told a lot of people it was important and had real potential to be big but almost nobody listened--people either don't have the technical background or they don't have the knowledge of money.
Now it's grown to the point where it should be obvious to most who look into it how important it is.  At this point the biggest threat to bitcoin as first mover is another crypocurrency.  However I've accepted the reality of that risk and no longer need to attack people for just mentioning other cryptos.  I want to know what crypos exists so I can keep an eye on things.  I even mention them myself on the rare occasion when I think they are relevant and though I'm not surprised at the shit I take over it it does annoy me.

The primary corrupting force of banks and governments is not money, it's the ability to create fiat money out of thin air.  That is not possible with bitcoin with the exception of centralized exchanges (like gox) running fractional reserve (which gox was doing, perhaps unintentionally, as coins were lost).  We need to either avoid centralized bitcoin exchanges or develop ways to fully audit holdings of centralized exchanges and make sure there is no fractional reserve happening.  Either one should be possible with bitcoin.

Josephus didn't live at the time Jesus lived and his writings are considered by scholars (and anyone who reads them) to be interpolations by early Christians.  This is because Josephus was a *Jewish* historian and yet the writings supposedly from him make comments about Jesus that wouldn't be said by a jew but by a Christian (e.g. that Jesus was more than a man, was the Christ, etc.).  
The fact that you have no historian to mention except Josephus is a reflection of the total lack of historical support for Jesus and the new testament.  There simply is no support for him except a few falsified phrases added to the writings of a Jewish historian who wasn't even born until after the time Jesus supposedly died.
There were of course historians at the time Jesus supposedly lived.  Some right in the towns Jesus supposedly did his miracles in.  And yet they don't mention him or his works at all.  Why do you suppose that is?

Most people aren't even aware the dollar has changed significantly about every 40 years last century.  And guess what, that 40 year period is now up again and we recently started printing money non-stop.  Gonna be interesting to see where the dollar ends up this time.

When you look a few years into the future you might imagine that people notice they have these bitcoins they use along with fiat to move money easily and cheaply and get discounts at stores...  and they might start getting used to having a little bitcoin laying around in reserve... and eventually they get more comfortable using those bitcion directly without switching to fiat.  Before you know it people are using bitcoin instead of dollars when it comes to certain things like discounted online purchases, remittances, etc.  Soon the whole concept of switching in and out of fiat becomes an extra step you don't bother with because your endpoints now all take bitcoin.

It's hurts people and hurting people is objectively wrong as we can all observe from the fact we don't like to be hurt.  People have known things of that nature were wrong even before the bible existed.  The golden rule exists in some form in nearly every religion and moral system on earth (including those that predate Christianity and don't have notions of gods in them like Buddhism).  But hey, if you want to believe slavery is ok, that women speaking in church is bad, or eating shellfish is wrong, then bible is for you.  That sort of nonsense sure isn't objectively obvious to the rest of us--you need a book written by ancient nutjobs to give you morality like that.
Besides, if you actually look around you'll find being religious doesn't cause people to act better.  In the case of Christianity it seems to make makes them act worse.  US prisons are full of Christians.

As a trader of 15+ years, here are some tips.  
* Trading by nature is a negative return game.  Generally speaking traders trade an asset back and forth and where someone gains the other loses.  As the exchange takes fees from both sides on every trade there is an overall negative return for the traders equal to the fees charged.
* Most traders lose money
* In general the more a trader trades the more they will lose
* Of the few successful traders most will under-perform the total gains of the underlying but with lower risk (and this is the good case). In other words if an asset went up 100% a profitable trader might make 80% but have lower draw-downs than the asset price experienced.   
* In the case of bitcoin there are significant systematic risks that make profitable trading extremely difficult.  E.g. Exchanges will go down or have problems during key huge moves and you'll miss them; exchanges will steal/lose your bitcoins or fail and walk away with them.
The lesson from the above is if you want the best chance of actually capturing the gains of an asset, bitcoin in particular, simply buy it and hold.  I can guarantee you the people who have made the most from bitcoin (by far!) are not traders but those that bought early, secured their coins offline, and held through everything.
On the flip side I can also guarantee you that the vast majority of people who have been in bitcoin early and tried to trade to riches have lost money trading and usually have had their bitcoins lost/stolen.  These people have missed out on significant returns by choosing the wrong strategy.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:16:49
What exactly are you "buying" if you buy gox?  A half a billion dollars in missing assets, a sh*t storm of lawsuits, and a bunch of non-standard garbage code that loses money for years and doesn't know it?
If there are any companies looking to "buy" gox it will be for select assets of the company...  just part of the asset sale as the company is stripped of anything of value and sold as it goes bankrupt.  Maybe someone will buy the name (though I can't imagine why), or the customer list or something.  But take on the whole mess of the company and all its problems?  I doubt it.  No organization in their right mind would do that.  They'll buy any assets that might remain but let the rest go under with the customers.

Wrong.  The dollar and most other western countries only became fiat currencies in the 70's  and that transition WAS a failure of most western currencies but particularly the gold-backed dollar.  Since then many western countries currencies have changed significantly (e.g. euro countries).  Of course now that the dollar is fiat it hasn't even been around for five decades yet (along with most other western currencies that still are around), which makes your statement rather absurd.  And the dollar nearly failed in the late 70's early 80's as Ron Paul states in the video.  What happened in 2008 was another failure of the dollar that so far has been held off...  but at significant cost.  The dollar is basically still failing, just in another way.  Take a look yourself at the change that just happened in 2008.  Nothing like that has happened in the dollar's history... and this is precisely what leads to a hyperinflationary failure--just ask Germany:

For the same reason any money has value:  the market recognizes that it is fit for the purpose of being money and uses it for that purpose.  Bitcoin is being used, more so every day.  This is not surprising as bitcoin was specifically designed to be good money and fulfills the various properties that good money has.  We can go through those properties if you want, but I suspect you don't really care.  You're not interested in actual facts as you are about finding reasons to dislike bitcoin because that's that position you decided on (probably for emotional reasons).
Bitcoin is largely misunderstood because few people understand money, few people understand the software/encryption issues, and even fewer people understand both.  I'm guessing you're in the camp of understanding neither.

The charges didn't seem to have anything to do with the stories of illegal activity they claimed they told the sellers.

He addresses your point in the essay but you don't address his.  He argues altcoins, such that they are argued to be a viable investment over bitcoin, harm people because people will eventually lose money with them.  If altcoins are only for feature testing, as you claim, then they should be sold as such (and would have no real value, no more than bitcoin's testcoin).  But they are not sold as such, there is a lot of speculative money in them and that money will be lost and hurt people.

Compared to the total coins available, there are a relatively small number of coins in exchanges being used to set price. Moving the price of all coins around doesn't take many coins... you can see the entire &gt; $100 dump on BTC-e was only a few thousand coins total and that includes all panic sellers.  It's the same story with gold and silver... a small amount of capital relative to the entire market can move price significantly... and bitcoin isn't very big in the first place.

Employment hasn't recovered, income and wealth has declined, family owned business is at record new lows, monetary base is exploding like a banana republic. I could grab another half dozen indicators if I wanted too but what's the point?  I've supported my case why I see no recovery in anything but bailed out banks and a stockmarket being driven by money printing.  Go look at any recession and its recovery in the data and see how bad this "recovery" is by comparison--this is the worst recovery on record despite having the largest stimulus by far. It's why the Fed is still printing billions every month even 7 years later now and holding rates at historic lows hoping the data improves! The Fed isn't as blind as you.  Longer term demographics only explains the longer-term declining employment chart, not the one that plunged in 2008 and did not recover nor the 90's style unemployment rate numbers done by shadowstats. The rest of your excuses for the other data don't excuse anything let alone refute simple facts of continuing decline and no recovery. You never even made a case for a recovery so there is nothing for me to reply to except to wonder why you replied at all.

(Ignoring that the federal reserve is not part of the government)...  the answer to your question is the government wants both inflation AND inflation to not be accounted for properly in the CPI as it benefits them for multiple reasons.  One reason is GDP will appear higher as it is inflation adjusted and if inflation is under-reported GDP will appear higher by what is really inflation.  Another reason is costs like social security and other benefits are adjusted by inflation so if inflation is under-reported it reduces those costs to the government.

As an aside, if you bought a fixed dollar amount of bitcoin every 2 weeks instead of a fixed number of bitcoin you would be dollar cost averaging which has some  benefits. As bitcoin price falls you would be buying more, automatically lowering your average cost you've paid per bitcoin over time. Basically you'd be buying two bitcoins at $350 when you were only buying one at $700 and taking advantage of the price dip. Buying just one now when they are cheap makes no sense when you were paying double that a few months ago.

Bitcoin is extremely disruptive to the establishment, and not for the reasons given to regulate bitcoin.  Regulation isn't going to bring bitcoin mainstream acceptance,  it will be used as a weapon in the upcoming fight against bitcoin.  The fight won't be for what is best, it will be to keep the established system in power.  This is why the creator of bitcoin stayed anonymous from the start, he knew he was creating a threat to the most powerful interests in the world.  We haven't seen the fight yet but it's coming.  You will not get a seat at the table if you bow down for regulation, because bitcoin obsoletes the table and everyone currently sitting at it.

Letting you control your money yourself is really what bitcoin is all about.

There have been many other reserve currencies and many global powers through history and all of them have eventually lost reserve status and had currency issues.  You might not want to hear the facts, and might want to imagine the US will be where it is forever but history suggests that's highly unlikely to happen.  In the meantime the US is actively printing trillions in new base money, our debts are over 100% of GDP and just a few years ago our budget deficits were over 50%--these are numbers that historically have led to currency crisis in literally dozens of examples in recent history. Maybe you think economic reality won't apply to the US where it has to every other country in history, but I think you're wrong.

Real life example of email vs fax (from the 90's):
* Take letter and scan into computer (and good luck getting the scanner to work easily)
* Open email program, import scan as attachment
* Send email to recipient
* Recipient receives email, saves out attachment
* Recipient opens attachment in word processor and prints it   (probably requires graphic file conversion program first)
* **Total time and hassle:  Big**
* Take letter and fax it
* Recipient receives faxed letter
* **Total time and hassle:  small**

But who saves us from the regulators and governments when they are the ones that start abusing the system?

I doubt the market manipulation that can come from derivatives can push bitcoin to near zero.  But I think it can keep bitcoin cheap and prevent it from rising significantly for extended periods.  The number of bitcoin that trade on exchanges at any moment and define price is very small compared to the total number of bitcoin.  When you take into account the leverage that derivatives have it doesn't take much equity to push around that small number of coins setting current price.
Bitcoin is likely to go the same way gold is going to go...   price will eventually be set off exchanges and the exchange price will mean nothing as it is the price for centralized "paper" bitcoin.  Gold is already in backwardation and heading that direction.

As bitcoin wages are priced in dollars or other fiat currently (and likely to remain that way for a long while), they don't suffer from wage stickiness.

If you tried to trade fairly rather than coding in some way to cheat (e.g. delaying trades or something), it wouldn't matter that you coded the exchange.  And maybe coding in a way to cheat wouldn't go unnoticed and he couldn't do that.
Interestingly if he did trade with customer coins on gox then he would've lost them to other gox customers.  Customers would've been making apparent gains on their accounts but as he couldn't deduct coins from customer accounts no coins would exist to fund those gains.  Virtual coin count in the exchange would go up but not the number of actual coins.  What that might mean is some of the "lost" coins might not have existed in the first place and so might not be able to be found by examining wallets/transactions.

They won't like what they hear but won't be able to refute the truth... so  they will hate you and take comfort in calling you crazy.

Fixed money supply is only a problem when there is a shortage of currency as a result (e.g. see Krugman's "babysitting co-op scrip" example from his book "The Return of Depression Economics").  This is not a problem with bitcoin as bitcoin is hugely divisible and cannot go into shortage like scrip can, it merely divides further and raises in value until supply/demand equilibrium is met.
As for inflation, I've had the discussion before.  Here's a taste for how it went (the guy never responded after I showed him that his own example commodity, wheat, has in fact doubled in price since 2005):
As for pork...  did you know pork futures are up 50%(!!) since Aug last year?

I'm talking about mining specifically.  From what I understand mining is now treated as income so if you made income from mining in the past you'll need to pay taxes from those past years.
As far as transactions go, anytime you make a capital gain on a transaction you have to pay capital gains taxes.  So you should've already paid taxes on bitcoin transactions in past years if you made capital gains.
I'm no tax guy though.

During this early adopter period the incentives for bitcoin are mostly speculative. As bitcoin matures the incentives will become clear to all. Later when bitcoin has matured further people will buy bitcoin for its freedom, flexibility, savings ability, global access, security, steadily increasing value, etc. By that time merchants will be discounting to get bitcoin over costly credit and declining fiat, giving even more reason to buy bitcoin. But again this is in the future, for the moment only those with the foresight to see that potential future are buying.

I've already discussed my view on the short-term falling price.  I also already explained falling volume.  Bitcoin is up thousands of percent the last year or two.  It doesn't take as much bitcoin to move the same amount of value around now.  Value-wise volume is increasing exponentially with transactions exactly as expected.

The business case is easy to make. The tougher case is getting people to buy and use bitcoin. The reasons I'm excited about bitcoin most people are unaware of, don't care about, don't want to hear about, and often won't believe anyway. The only angle I know for convincing ordinary people to use a new money system that can be difficult to buy and lacks consumer protections is discounts. And right now the discounts aren't consistently good enough.
If price was rising then bitcoin sells itself, but when price is flat the bitcoin case for the typical consumer that is already well served by credit cards isn't strong enough. I think this will change with time but right now is not a great time to bring ordinary people onboard. For this to change businesses need to discount bitcoin better or the real risks of the dollar need to become more apparent (and that's probably another decade away still).

I don't think it will be that soon.  Unfortunately the best historical comparison I can find to what is happening is the fall of Rome and that went on for a LONG time.  We seem to be headed down a similar path...  a path that keeps a corrupt political elite in power for a long time despite being bankrupt.  The path includes feeding the many poor so they are dependent on the system and keeping them distracted, militarizing the police and turning that police slowly against the people (in particular to keep the rabble in line and eventually to forcibly take wealth from the upper classes to keep the poor fed and the police/military paid).  It took Rome centuries before it finally collapsed.  Though one thing that might make it faster is US (and world) money is already fiat.

As the dollar is constantly falling in value and isn't ever going to stop, gold will be worth a million dollars an oz one day, the only question is when.  
The dollar has lost 85% of its value in my lifetime alone, and that's while the dollar has been the reserve currency--the most used and powerful currency on the planet.  If the status of the dollar changes, and it seems to be headed that direction rapidly since 2008, the rate of value decline might not be so gentle (if you can call 85% loss in a few decades gentle).

How about this metric...
Where is all that newly created base money going to go?  Can it stay "sterilized" and out of the economy forever or what?  What happens if things, as they tend to, don't go as planned and it gets into the economy?  (bonus question: is the printing ever going to stop?)
Here's a few more metrics for you.  Historically what tends to happen to countries that are on a fiat currency, are currently printing, have debt to GNP over 80% and budget deficits over 40%?  Answer, the money fails, often in a hyperinflation.  The US is in exactly that position with the exception of gains from the rising stock market having pushed our budget deficits back down for the moment.  So what do you think happens on the next market correction and/or economic down turn?  Or the next?  Will the dollar even exist as it does today in 20 years?  Because I have my doubts and I've love to be convinced the future of our money isn't as bleak as it appears to me.

Depending on the estimate you choose for how much gold has been mined and the price of gold, there is around $6 trillion in gold that has been mined.

They likely won't be in another 6 months.  It's very easy to talk about reacting to "obvious" news but quite another thing to do it successfully over time.  Basically you're talking about trading and pointing to a short-term move with 20/20 hindsight.  When you look at a longer term chart of bitcoin there have been many booms and drops and if you'd sold at any point beyond the most recent it was a very big mistake.

No, when you deposit funds in a bank you are told you can have them back on demand.  That is in stark contrast to time based deposits like CDs which don't let you get them back on demand (because they are loaned out).  Do you even know what a bank run is?  Have you considered a bank run wouldn't be possible if banks actually structured their deposits correctly to match what was actually happening with the funds (e.g. if all deposits were time based deposits rather than demand deposits)?  Every other business is not allowed to promise on demand return of funds AND loan those funds out--that's why other businesses don't suffer from bank runs.
If you loan out bitcoins you know they are gone and you cannot ask for them back until the loan is up.  Banks don't work that way.

It's not a question of metric system.  It's a question of marketing and ease of use of the currency.  You won't find a currency anywhere denominated in tiny fractions.  This is because it's easier and more natural for ordinary users to work in whole numbers (large or not) than in tiny fractions.  This is true around the world.  Clearly there's a psychology issue at play here and it's real.  The need to manage the tiny fractions at all is the problem and the metric system doesn't solve it.  Clearly a lot of people see the benefits of using an actual name instead of a mathematical unit name here and even though it's a psychological/marketing thing it's important. 
After just a short period of use "bits" would in practice become the defacto base unit of bitcoin not merely a name for uBTC.  Fractions would be GONE as far as the users were concerned.  That's the power of a name and it could never happen with uBTC or mBTC.

The problem is everything is in the same boat so you don't have the choice to avoid it. But you can at least avoid buying things where the supply is managed outright, like dollars and other fiat.

We've lost our place because of what's happened to us.  The non productive portions of the economy (government, financial) have grown massively on the value that has been taken from the population via inflation to the point where the productive economy is now gutted.
Consider the analogy of the productive portion of the population being on a generating treadmill.  We trudge and generate gains for ourselves.  Natural phenomenon, increases in population and gains in technology and productivity, make our work easier over time.  The government/financial sector tells us these natural increases in gains are deflationary and deflation is "bad" due to "wage stickiness" and such.  They take over the gain controls of the treadmill (money) and the gauge that tells us how much gains we've created and how hard we've worked (economic measures like inflation).  
Now the increases in population, technology, and productivity still happen of course as they are natural.  But rather than have the people get the benefits of those increases, (deflation is "bad" you know), the government/financial system takes these gains while telling us its for our own good.  They take these extra generated gains and build a huge military industrial complex and a financial street like never seen before. And then because they can, they take a little more than the extra generated.  
This goes on until wives have to be trudging on the treadmill too, and despite that added effort the actual gains received per worker is lower than it used to be because the government/final sector are taking even more than what was gained by increases in technology/productivity and added people trudging.  But most people don't notice because they control the gauges that supposedly show us our efforts and gains and those gauges tell us we're doing better even though we're doing worse.
When someone take a close look at what's going on and starts to complain, "educated" people like you have been trained to tell them to look at the more tangible increases in technology and how lucky they are to have iphones and cheap air flights.  There is no mention of course how those would've come anyway in addition to more gains from increased labor if those gains weren't being stolen to make the non-productive government and financial sector the largest portions of the economy.
This goes on until the fiat monetary system used to manipulate the population collapses under the corruption, misallocations, and over-growth of non-productive areas of the economy that it spawns.  The hard working people caught in the collapse usually lose their savings while those causing the failure have the visibility and control to save their wealth...  but then along comes bitcoin....

Many of us have been saying this for months and getting a lot of agreement. A lot of services have added bits as an option. Unfortunately it hasn't been enough to get the standard default way of presenting bitcoin to change everywhere. And without everything moving to 'bits' it doesn't work. It's too confusing and dangerous to try to use bits when most services still use bitcoin.

Right now merchant adoption is a given.  As a merchant you'd be an idiot to not want to make the trivial changes necessary to include a new payment method that brings in a new market of people and is cheaper, gets you money faster, doesn't have fraud or charge backs, etc.  Merchant adoption is already outpacing consumer adoption because of this (and is partly behind the price drop IMO).  The only reason merchant adoption is not growing faster is a lot of merchants don't know yet, and there are not enough users of bitcoin yet.
Some will disagree with me but unfortunately there isn't as much reason for most ordinary consumers to adopt bitcoin (yet).  That's the real issue.  It's still mostly for early adopters.  Bitcoin is still not very easy to undertand, to get or to manage.  And unless a merchant discounts significantly there is little reason for a consumer to use bitcoin over a credit card as a credit card offers protections, perks, charge-back ability, and puts the fees for those on the merchant.
Bitcoin will be big but not for ordinary "in system" consumer purchases as many people think IMO.  And it will take time to develop the markets that bitcoin excels in.  Watch OpenBazaar as that might be the first big market bitcoin will excel in over credit cards and other "in system" payment methods.

I think you are confused. Collateral gives support to the loan/banking system, not the money. The loan/banking system actually depend on sound money as I explained. When money is already sound, collateral supports the banking loan process, but this collateral doesn't provide "non-monetary collateral" *to the money.* Sound money AND collateral allow banks to function.  Your original post describes why bank loans are sound (presuming sound money, which banking requires to function) but then draws a confused conclusion that collateral support of banking processes and  it's presumption of sound money is somehow an argument for the banking process giving support for money. This doesn't follow and is wrong.
You need the ground to walk on, but the fact you can walk doesn't mean walking is the basis for sound ground.
Unless you're not talking about banking collateral supporting the money...  but then I don't know what point you were trying to make in your original post. In it you said "the debt-dollars are ultimately enforced by USG's credible threat to enable banks and the IRS to take things when the debts aren't paid" but that is wrong. Banking is ultimately supported by threat of collateral repossession the debt-dollars aren't.

It's possible. The USSR government went down in 1991 with their currency despite being the world's number 2 superpower.  It's also possible the money changes more significantly than the government. It's even possible the government militarizes the police (we've seen some of that lately), turns the country into a police state and systematically robs the richer citizens of the country to keep the failing system running longer than it otherwise would--that happened in Rome during its decline for a long while before it finally collapsed. The only thing that I don't see happening is the current money printing, expanding government debt/spending, etc continuing on for another several decades without something failing/changing significantly. What cannot continue, won't.

False.  Bitcoin's future depends on it being used, but not necessarily using it a specific way the author prefers.  Saving bitcoin, using its store of value function, is as important as using its value exchange function.  Its store of value function is what makes bitcoin so attractive to many people as a solid store of value function is what is missing in our current monetary system.  Also those that save bitcoin arguably boost its value more than those that spend it.

There is 5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin right now.  If bitcoin were to somehow start getting replaced so that the 5 billion evaporated, the entire idea of crypto currencies would never recover.  You cannot destroy BILLIONS in value people hold in the biggest crypto and think the idea of crypto will survive that loss. Nobody will trust a future crypto to not get replaced and lose everyone's value if the previous major crypto was replaced and lost billions in value.  Bitcoin continues to exist and hold value or cryptocurrency is done.  Period.  End of story.

Dollars don't directly pay a dividend either.  It's the value-added from the VISA network that generates a dividend that is paid to VISA shareholders.  In the same way bitcoin doesn't pay a dividend itself but via the bitcoin network and mining it does in the same way as VISA.  Of course the dividend won't be as high because bitcoin is much more efficient than VISA and doesn't take as much money from users of the transaction network.

That sort of thing used to happen with coinbase wallets when you'd try to make a transaction.  How can you have a wallet that sometimes doesn't actually send your coins in the transaction for an hour or so?

I've heard of similar problems with sites like cryptothrift. You buy something with bitcoin from a stranger, get delivered product bought with stolen credit cards.
The creditcard industry is being owned by hackers and thieves right now. The only thing that makes the system hold together is the fact they can normally chase down the money/product and get it back because the fiat system is reversible. If you get in there with your nonreversible bitcoin, you end up where that chase ends facing issues of buying stolen goods.

Go ahead and look at income. Income peaked in the US in the 60's. A guy used to be able to support his family pumping gas. Now it takes both parents working and a bunch of credit card debt to support a family. 
The dollar has lost around 85% of its value in my lifetime alone and income has been falling my entire life too.  An hours worth of minimum wage from the mid sixties ($1.50) in quarters from the mid sixties is worth over $20 today. Is minimum wage $20 an hour today? Not even close.

It's difficult to take seriously someone who talks about honesty in the same post that they manipulate my words.  I never said "perfect store of value."

I agree bitcoin might not exist in 20 years (it might not exist in 5 years).  However fiat is also risky and might not exist in 20 years either.  I personally give bitcoin better odds on "meaningfully existing" 20 years from now compared to the dollar.  JMO.

You seem to see the bitcoin space evolving into the same debt-based mess that defines the current money system while I think that's unlikely.  Bitcoin is fundamentally different than fiat and I expect it to evolve its own new and unique place in the financial system.  Bitcoin is similar to being able to instantly divide and transfer physical gold--I don't see such an astounding capability degenerating into the same flawed strategies that manage fiat.
As for volatility, it seems premature to judge and dismiss bitcoin based on its current volatility issues that are largely associated with fledgling growth and market price discovery of a completely new type of asset.

Most average joes holding stocks in an exchange have no idea their shares can be (and often are) loaned to someone else and sold.  It's common practice but I think most people who buy an asset would prefer to own the asset rather than have the asset loaned to someone else who then sells it (hurting the long interests of the original owner).  The exchanges love it as they get to make fees selling/buying shares over and over again that would otherwise be unavailable if people actually took ownership. But don't mistake common practice and what is good for exchanges for being what is good for share owners or for the companies behind the shares.

Banks runs are so bad because a bank by it's standard mode of operation (fractional reserve) does not actually have funds to cover more than a small fraction of total possible withdrawals.  A bitcoin exchange is not run that way and should have funds to cover withdrawals... except in gox's case where from news reports we can presume many millions were confiscated.  So everyone should know they are running without all the funds they should and the prudent should have been out months ago.  You don't want to be in the group that is the last out and has to fight lawsuits and governments to try to get your coin back.

Currencies change value every minute too.  You just don't see the changes because you're measuring in the currency.  If you measured in bitcoin there would be no movement too--1 bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin.
And I insulted people who think like that because it's deserving of ridicule.  Assets, even dollars, are not stable.  The dollar is actually losing money every day and is down around 85% in value in my lifetime alone.

The reality is the costs of using bitcoin are significantly lower than the costs of using existing payment networks.  So overall we are all paying more for goods and services with the existing payment networks than we would be if we used bitcoin.  Bitcoin will change this but it will take time.

Bitcoin doesn't need to sell its ideals away to become big.  It will only become big because of them  as there is no need for more of what we already have.

That is not fractional reserve.  Fractional reserve is where the bank loans out 90% (often more) of deposits and simply doesn't have them to give back if people demand.  With cold wallets the company still has the funds directly in their control it just takes a bit of messing around to get them from secure storage.

I understand full well where bitcoin is likely to go in freer countries.  But in japan bitcoin won't catch on to reach the level of people being paid in bitcoin when there is a repressive tax on its purchase. That's what repressive taxes do. Someone actually has to first buy the bitcoin to pay it to someone else for their labor or product and they won't do that if there is an 8% tax on it.  If japan is interested in bitcoin expanding the FIRST thing to do is remove repressive 8% consumption taxes.

I don't think a 5% discount to avoid charge-backs, fraud, delays in receiving payment, etc. is money losing for merchants.

Otherwise people will just use credit cards and the merchant will be stuck dealing with the various fees, losses, fraud, etc.

Rising value causes a lot more publicity than a few transactions (transactions which in general cause downward price pressure to boot).  The OP is advocating things that will actually keep driving price down.  You can't "force" bitcoin to be more than it is.  Let it find its equilibrium. bottom out and continue rising.  That will actually come faster IMO if you hold and avoid trivial transactions as such transactions cause downward price pressure.  Someone should explain that to dogecoiners too...  those guys use their currency into the ground.  The bigger the projects they raise money to fund from their holders, the more their coin falls--exactly as would be expected.

Yes I get that.  However the solution is to get your coins into your own control, which I have done.  Beyond that I can only appeal to other people to do the same.  If you own gold you hold it physical then despite shenanigans on exchanges, futures markets and forex markets, your gold is yours. Bitcoin is the same, if you don't control the private key you don't own the bitcoin.

I doubt he lost any keys.  More likely gox has been running fractional reserve for a while (due to losses from smaller hacks, government confiscation, or whatnot) and Mark has been trying  to get back losses by trading (gambling) and eventually lost everything.  A single rogue trader trying to cover internal losses has taken down bigger companies than gox... Barings bank was taken down by a guy doing that.  
We might never know what happened until Mark tells us.  But I bet he lost the money "trading" and he doesn't have the balls to come clean... he thinks he can still make the money back somehow (which is the attitude + ego that lost the money in the first place).

You say that with such certainty but the fact is in the 1000 year history of fiat currency the one thing that stands out is how short the lifespan of fiat is. Most fiat currencies don't last more than three decades and no fiat has lasted longer than a handful of decades or so. You might not be aware but the fiat dollar is an old currency in fiat years (4 decades old) and has a lot of pressure building on it. It's difficult to believe if you don't know how these things go but the dollar might not even exist in its current form in 20 years or so. It might not exist as a reserve currency for another decade (and that translation isn't likely to go well for the dollars value).
So anyway for myself I wouldn't be making any bets that the dollar will outlast bitcoin... Bitcoin came into existence because the dollar's life came into serious question in 2008. Those issues have not gone away, they've only been papered over for the moment.

Bitcoin already solves most the issues mentioned, it just needs to be more widely used.  It's not enough to be able to move money around cheaply in bitcoin and make a few purchases with gyft or something. Converting to/from fiat is costly and difficult. People need to be able to be paid in bitcoin and make the majority of their purchases and payments in bitcoin. Then these issues fall away.

Yes, rich people have more money so when 2% is made they make more actual dollars than someone with less money, however they make the same percentage.

The same description applies to fiat too except they centrally manage fiat to devalue over time so you are penalized by holding it. So by all means ONLY use a centrally managed fiat currency that is guaranteed to lose value over time.  Don't even think of putting any value in a decentralized currency designed to increase in value over time, that would be stupid.
Also note that your entire comment only applies to investments like stocks and not to money itself.  Bitcoin is a money so your comment doesn't even apply.  Do a bit of research on money and perhaps forex trading and then come back.

These aren't my conclusions, I'm only an observer.  The debt/deficit levels for monetary failure I mentioned come from a study of 29 cases of monetary failure by Bernholz. He identified critical levels of debt and deficit in a country that prints its own money as the best predictor for monetary failure (government debt over 80% of GNP and the deficit over 40% of spending).  If you have any better predictors I'd love to hear them, but sorry I'm not interested in empty comments about how our authorities have no desire for failure.  Of course they don't but what they want and what actually happens have little to do with each other.
Ref on Bernholz:
Maybe you disagree with the particular indicators or levels Bernholz finds, but based on what?  The reality is the finances of a country and its monetary system do have limits.  What are they?  How close to those limits are we?  Whatever those limits might be we will find them because we simply continue to expand the growth of our debt, deficit, money printing, etc. with no regard for anything but the immediate political future.  The strategy you're apparently taking of simply ignoring the issue while assuming those in control know what they're doing is exactly what most everyone does and is what has led to every other fiat in history to fail.  Ours will be no exception at the rate we're going.  And I'm telling you based on history the end is closer than you think.

In many cases bitcoin is cheaper and quicker even if you go through the ridiculous and unnecessary process of converting to/from fiat.  If you stay in bitcoin (as I do) the sign is 100% accurate, and that's my view of what the sign means.  
And yes bitcoin is objectively better than other methods of sending money as anyone that has actually used it knows.  If you're going to cherry-pick a case of swapping around to/from fiat, save yourself the trouble, I'm talking about usage of bitcoin not fiat.

That's not what is behind backwardation.  During backwardation anyone with physical gold can sell their gold and buy the same amount in gold futures for less and get their gold back later when the futures expire and pocket the difference as profit (in addition to savings they get from not having to insure or store the gold).  So why aren't the people holding the trillions in physical gold out there doing that and capturing that "risk free" profit (which would then bring back contango)?  Why is that arbitration play sitting there leaving money on the table and actually becoming a more profitable play every week?  Because at the moment the holders of physical gold don't trust the derivatives system to get their physical gold back to them at expiration.  The level of backwardation is a monetary measure of the level of systemic  fear...  and its been increasing for several weeks now.

Fine, I'll google it for you, dumbass.  Here's Wikipedia stating exactly what I've been saying from the page on deflation:
"From a monetarist perspective, deflation is caused primarily by a reduction in the velocity of money and/or the amount of money supply per person.
A historical analysis of money velocity and monetary base shows an inverse correlation: for a given percentage decrease in the monetary base the result is nearly equal percentage increase in money velocity.[8] This is to be expected because monetary base (MB), velocity of base money (VB), price level (P) and real output (Y) are related by definition: MB*VB = P*Y. "
Here's the inverse from Wikipedia's page on hyperinflation, again exactly what I've been saying:
"Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the money supply and an increase in the velocity of money if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. **Either one, or both of these** together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the "crisis of confidence" model of hyperinflation"

Price is set by a small number of coins (relative to the total coins that exist) being actively trading on exchanges.

Through history gold is stable and has held a monetary value for literally thousands of years.  That is no small statement--gold is literally the monetary basis of everything, period.  Even today with the lowered emphasis on gold in the west we still see governments, central banks, banks, etc. holding it as their core monetary asset.  
Through history government fiat is stable for only short periods and holds value for periods measured in decades at most.

We need another exponential price rise and the increase in user base and value that comes with it. More big retailers will then come to get some of that value on their own. I'm actually surprised bitcoin has attracted a few retailers with billion+ market caps despite bitcoin being so small with  only a few billion in total value. Most big retailers won't pay attention until bitcoin is bigger than they are and able to carry the sort of value they deal in. Right now bitcoin is simply too small to be in the game at that level.
The next stunning price move will happen naturally in the next year or two. (A likely time is the next mining distribution halving). The move to $8,000-$10,000 bitcoin will be huge... so much excitement, so many new users,  millions of ordinary people getting a growing piece of newly created internet value--it will be incredible. Eventually a BILLION in new value will be being created per day as the price rises. Retailers will be falling all over themselves to get a piece.   But now is the time to get on board and get some cheap bitcoin before that happens. 
TL;DR:  A big price move will happen before the big retailers come.  Get positioned.

If you setup an online wallet using coinbase.com that takes some time to associate with your bank account and verify.  But go ahead and make one if you want, maybe it will be quicker for you.  It's one of the easier ways to buy coins if you're in the US.
And yes, the mycelium wallet is just on your phone.  You don't need a username or login, it runs just on your phone without requiring that due to how bitcoins can work without banks and accounts.  It's a good idea to do the backup procedure if you're going to hold coins of any value on there.
To receive coins you can use the Mycelium wallet app...  use it's receive coins function which will present a QR code for someone to scan and send coins to you.  The wallet app will tell you when coins are sent to your wallet and how much were sent.

Yes, the industry was a minefield, just like the bitcoin industry is a minefield today.  But bitcoin itself is not.  There was no way I know of to have invested in the internet itself back in the 90's, but there is a way to invest in bitcoin itself.
As for Buffett, bully for him for not investing in a minefield.  Bully for him for being a capitalist who didn't take a risk to bring forward the biggest thing to happen in his lifetime.  So maybe stupid isn't the word...  maybe the word is irrelevant.  He's irrelevant.  He was irrelevant with the internet then.  He's irrelevant with bitcoin now.

$1000 per bitcoin puts it around the market cap of western union, a company now largely obsoleted by bitcoin. That's a minimum, if bitcoin were only good for international remittances.  Bitcoin also works a lot like gold in terms of an internationally recognized store of value immune from inflation and other problems of government fiat (but with huge advantages like easier storage and transmission including online transmission).  If bitcoin takes off in that role and captures only a fraction of the value of the gold market, you're talking six figures a bitcoin (that's probably on the high end).  So somewhere above $1000 but less than six figures is a perhaps a fair price for what bitcoin is now.  But bitcoin has only just started and frankly I don't think we've seen the whole story of what it will eventually become.  So for me personally I'm not interested in selling any of my bitcoins for under five figures.  
The folks out there selling now at under $500 are setting themselves up for some serious regrets later IMO.

You don't loan bitcoin without them leaving your wallet.  Unlike with the current banking system you will know when you loans bitcoin you no longer have them and must trust someone else to pay them back.

Bitcoin is up thousands of percent since last year.  That sort of move will have a pullbacks of a significant nature.  Despite that anyone who has been invested over the last year or two is doing better than any investment on the planet, period.
Honestly the most recent book I've bought in my studies is this one, I got it only a few months ago:
It's a study of 29 modern hyperinflations by Bernholz.  I bought it specifically to see the chapter that discusses critical levels of government debt and budget deficits in governments currently printing fiat in his studies of failed currencies.  From that chapter I can see that the US levels of debt are over the critical levels hit by other countries that hyperinflated while our budget deficits are in danger range just below critical levels.  I figure we're within 20 years of a hyperinflation, JMO.  It could be quicker if our budget deficits go higher rapidly like they did in 2008.  Bottom line is the dollar as it exists today is fucked.  But you can believe whatever you want.  The good news is even when currencies fail life goes on.  You just might not have the savings you once had is all.

This is only the beginning. Miners hold all the power.  Years from now if the largest miners get together to use a version of the software that (for one example) doesn't halve the block reward I don't see what could stop them.  Mining is supposed to be distributed and competitive but I predict we'll find consolidation and collusion for gain (once bitcoin is more established and it's not as big a threat to adoption) will eventually become a big problem.
Unfortunately bitcoin merely moves the power from banks/governments to miners.  And years from now miners might become as corrupt as them from that power.  Someone please explain how I'm wrong.  I would love to be wrong on this.  This is bitcoin's biggest flaw in my mind and I never hear about it.

I'm not for bank bailouts but you can't just pay off consumer debt and give everyone cash either.  If the Fed had done that it would've caused an immediate extreme round of inflation crushing the value of the dollar and destroying dollar based savings across the country.  Bonds, pensions, annuities, life insurance, etc. would be reduced to a fraction of their value.  Savers would be robbed of their savings.  It would gut retirement plans and make pensioners and those on fixed income destitute.  The $8000 everyone was given in the end probably wouldn't buy much more than a BigMac.  The economy itself would likely implode and the debtors that were supposed helped would be in a worse situation than before.

A couple issues:
1)  There is no imperative to loan bitcoin like there is with fiat because you don't need to get a return to keep it from deprecating in value as it's not an inflating currency.

Holding bitcoin IS using bitcoin. It's using the secure wealth storage function of bitcoin and it's something bitcoin is very good at.   Snapcash and the rest depreciate and are centralized and so can't be depended on for wealth storage.

Exactly.  The gospels are the eventual written record of passed down oral tradition, not eye witness account.  Nobody knows who wrote them, nobody knows how much (if any) of it is actually true.  We all know how unreliable oral stories are...   people embellish, change and invent things.  In fact there is a name for oral stories like those in the bible that are defined by their highly unlikely supernatural content:  legends.
The reality is there is no historical record for the new testament stories.  No historian of the time even documents Jesus let alone him doing miracles.  
And no it's not like the blockchain because we know the blockchain preserves its content via a chain of hashes.  The stories in the bible are whatever someone decided to write down with no validation any of it even happened.

You are talking about a future that already arrived. Bitcoin is already useful for consumer purchases, even paypal can see that. The time for speculation in that future was a couple years ago.

People like me with a forward view of bitcoin are not selling bitcoin at these prices.
The day bitcoin becomes stationary is the day price must rise significantly to entice holders to sell. When something is undervalued it is removed from circulation by hoarders until price rises to entice selling. I'm not enticed to sell at this insignificant market cap.

The issue isn't the price of the underlying asset being driven higher or lower, the issue here (which apparently you don't even understand) is the difference between the price of the future and the price of the underlying physical.  The gap between the future price and the price of the underlying (whether in contango or backwardation) is a function of arbitrage via the physical asset being brought to market.  Futures prices can't get far out of whack to the physical because of this, except in certain cases like physical commodity shortage or for gold, in the case where the holders of physical stop putting up their physical for futures due to systemic fears.  Gold is a unique commodity and doesn't act like other commodities.  When it goes into backwardation it means very significant things in the monetary realm.  Google gold backwardation for more on this.

I'm sure quite a number of margined bitcoin traders have been forced to take big losses lately due to buying bitcoin on margin.
Margin removes the simple strategy of riding out a drop by simply holding and turns it into an extremely stressful nightmare where you tend to be forced out at the worst times and lose your bitcoin.  
Bitcoin already moves like a hugely margined asset--if you use margin on top of bitcoin's typical volatility it's quite likely you will really regret it at some point.

And they manage to hold those reserves in such a way it doesn't restrict how they manage their dollars. And at the same time they convince everyone else to avoid or sell gold, lol.

You need to stop being so focused on yourselves.  One way or the other you won't be allowed to take more than half the pie. Stop trying to take over the majority of the pie and instead foster the whole pie to get bigger so your (already huge) slice of it gets bigger.  
Given the number of bitcoins emitted is fixed, the way to make the pie bigger is to get the value of bitcoin to go UP.  Trying to take over the majority of the network is doing the opposite of that.

You can have the best performing asset of our lifetimes...  something that goes up 1000% a year...  and despite that it will do things that make the majority of investors lose money with it while shaking off the maximum number of long-term bulls before it moves higher.  It's perverse--people that couldn't wait to buy in over $1000 now sell under $400.  Here it is under $400...  do they want it?  No.  Can they be convinced it will be over $3000 next year?  No.  Will it be over $3000 next year?  I bet it will, but that doesn't stop the drop now because people act emotionally and in herds.
When will the drop stop?  When enough people have given up hope and sold.  My guess is right here...  under $400.  This is where a lot of people will freak out and try to take out what little money they've made since last year.

Through history gold is stable and has held a monetary value for literally thousands of years. That is no small statement--gold is literally the monetary basis of everything, period. Even today with the lowered emphasis on gold in the west we still see countries, central banks, banks, etc. holding it as their core monetary asset.   It has a lower respect in the west lately but that is a temporary condition that is a reflection of the poor monetary education here (on top of purposeful actions here designed to reduce the view of gold here in order to bolster the standing of government fiat in the eyes of markets and the population).

It seems people get paid if they work or not. So it's more about wealth redistribution than minimum wage.  Why work when government will take the fruits of your labors and give to someone else. Just don't work and be on the receiving end.  Sounds like a good way to chase the productive out of the country and convert everything else to government controlled slums filled with incapable losers. Probably wouldn't be long before the government and society fails or an invading country simply walks in and takes control.
When this sort of stuff is being voted for you know your society is on the way out. Your people have lost sight of the value of productivity and your government is promising to pay off the masses of incapable lazy losers for votes. Soon you'll have a few in government completely in control of a nonexistent economy and a lot of suffering in a broke, enslaved citizenry.

I had a big bitcoin "ah-ha" moment last year after a big price move.

Overall transactions are increasing, wallets are increasing, places to spend bitcoin are increasing, number of bitcoin enthusiasts are increasing, etc.   And yet the transaction volume in dollars is mostly flat for the year as you point out (though still increasing longer term year over year).  So why is that? Let me suggest why that is and why it doesn't surprise me.  The TL;DR explanation is because bitcoin is being hoarded.  The longer answer is bitcoin is rightly seen as a better store of value than dollars with a large potential upside.  Bitcoin holders tend to hold onto their bitcoin and spend junk currency like dollars instead.  This isn't a bad thing, it's just the nature of the game right now.  Every day there is nearly 2 million dollars worth of bitcoin mined into existence and most of this bitcoin quietly vanishes into someone's savings, waiting for a future day when its value has appreciated closer to a fair value for what bitcoin truly is.
So does it concern me that everyone isn't spending bitcoin?  No--I expect it.  I don't spend much bitcoin myself because it would be silly to sell something at $480 that is easily worth $10,000 (and very likely will be shortly).  I expect many other bitcoin users feel the same way.  Businesses that want the digital gold that is bitcoin will have to discount quite a bit in order to get people to release some.  Otherwise people will just use junk currency like dollars or the even junkier currency of credit to buy things.

Below is a link to an Intuit infographic that shows real inflation over 2 years is out of control in many things:  111% in healthcare, 118% in kids activities, 70% in education, 65% in daycare, 30% in utilities, etc.  Those are inflation increases people are REALLY paying over just 2 years!
The thinking that velocity is falling so inflation is not an immediate problem is simply wrong.  Low velocity might reduce signs of inflation in some things temporarily but multiplication of the money supply is always a problem as it is the root cause of the eventual fall in value of the currency when velocity picks back up.  And in reality inflation is hitting hard, it's just not hitting everything (yet).  Just because the government can manipulate the CPI numbers to reduce the weight of the things that are going up to make inflation seem low doesn't mean inflation is low.  Anyone actually buying things (rather than living off their parents) knows things have become bad the last few years.

A currency is only related to its economy *while it functions as good money.*  When a currency is mismanaged to the point where its store of value function fails, it no longer functions as good money and will no longer have the confidence of the people and its previous association with the economy breaks down (trashing the economy in the process).  Every currency in history that has failed, failed despite being linked with an actual economy at some point.  Generally it's not the failure of the economy that kills the money, its political/management failure (though there is a relationship to the economy as the mismanagement is usually associated with economic stress, exactly as we see now in the US).  And it doesn't matter how big or powerful the economy, if the currency is mismanaged enough it will fail regardless.  You can't borrow, print and spend beyond certain reasonable limits no matter how big you are.
So yes, the US economy is big and powerful, etc., etc.  But its money is currently in its end game due to mismanagement.  And unfortunately the US economy will most likely follow down the same hole as the currency.  This is not some unique or speculative case, this has happened dozens of times even in the last hundred years.

Money lost its relationship with division and exchange of gold a long time ago.  Money is now a debt-based system with some outward appearnce of such exchange but significant differences.  In particular there is a conflation of asset and claim to asset.  Gold has significant problems in that it's difficult to store, secure, divide, exchange, etc.  So people use 3rd parties and representational monies to "solve" those problems.  Those systems eventually broke down and became fiat over time.  Bitcoin does not have the problems gold does--it is gold without the problems of gold. It allows money to act as it never has been able to act before.
With bitcoin there is no conflation of bitcoin with claim to bitcoin like there is with fiat.  You either have a bitcoin or you don't, just like you either have gold or you don't.  If you lend bitcoin your bitcoin it is gone and is replaced with a lending contract.  You don't think your lending contract is bitcoin, and neither is that lending contract seamlessly interchanable with bitcoin.  Nobody will be implicitly lending their bitcoin and still thinking they have their bitcoin like what happens with fiat in banking today.  Instead there will be bitcoin, and bitcoin-based instruments that aren't bitcoin (e.g. claims to bitcoin of various sorts).  Proof of reserves will guarentee your bitcoin exists where you think it does.
With bitcoin not being debt based and not being conflated with bitcoin debt there will be no uncontrolled expansion of the bitcoin supply from lending.  There will be always be the known number of bitcoin, and you'll know what bitcoin you hold and what debt-based assets you hold.  The debt-based assets might inflate or have varoius problems associated with such things, but as bitcoin is distinct from them it won't be like the situation with fiat today.

You can depend on gold being there 50 or 100 years from now to have value even if all the fiat currencies of the world have failed. It is a dependable store of value despite being a less convenient means of exchange than fiat. That's why central banks hold gold and why gold is the defacto basis of our monetary system.  Right now bitcoin is like gold but with the exchange ability of fiat. It is arguably better than both gold and fiat. But if bitcoin is replaced then crypto cannot be relied on to be a store of value, it wouldn't matter if it deflates or inflates as crypto would be regulated to only a means of exchange--something fiat already does well. It would no longer be better than gold nor better than fiat. People that understand money would dump it in a hot second.
Bitcoin can change, dependably bringing its  existing value with it... but it cannot be replaced.

No, for the same reasons already mentioned.  On a longer scale it's exponential reflecting bitcoin adoption.  And as I explained before I'm coming from a place of surprise at the number of transactions.  I don't transact often in bitcoin, I hold them.  At the moment fiat is better for transaction--it's easier to replace, has consumer protections, doesn't have tax gain/loss tracking requirements, etc.  Also bitcoin is a higher quality asset than dollars like gold.  Why would I use it over lower quality assets?  Just like I would choose to sell dollars over selling gold, I choose to sell dollars over selling bitcoin.  This is not a reflection of a decline in bitcoin, it is a reflection of the nature of bitcoin (which frankly most on this forum don't understand).  Just wait until hyperinflation takes off, transaction rates in dollars will go to the moon and bitcoin transactions will drop.  That's not because everyone suddenly hated bitcoin but the opposite--it's that they don't want to trade their bitcoin for dollars anymore.

No currency makes a return and yet companies are dwarfed by currency markets and are routinely bought and sold in currency. When you realize even small businesses cannot be exchanged in bitcoin yet it gives you a glimpse of how far bitcoin still has to go before it becomes actually useful on a global scale as a currency. But you are right, bitcoin cannot be compared to company market caps... if it succeeds as a global currency it will dwarf those numbers.

Coins can only be withdrawn if they exist (which they probably don't).  And people would buy coins to withdraw which would push price UP.
But you are right about delays and limits... there will be plenty of those... to hide gox's insolvency.
I'd like gox to come clean and announce how many coins were stolen.  But I won't hold my breath.  Those incompetent losers probably don't even know how many coins are gone.  They can't even track transactions themselves without blockchain.info's help and think we should be impressed it will take them days to reindex a database that isn't even that big.

Larger retailers will not move to bitcoin until bitcoin is large enough to carry the sort of value the retailers deal in.  Right now bitcoin is tiny at under $7 billion in value. Bitcoin is literally not big enough to be a player in the markets of merchants whose market caps are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions. Bitcoin has to expand its value first before it will be taken seriously and adopted in larger markets.
The continued growth and acceptance of bitcoin we see daily implies another wave higher in price that takes bitcoin to a larger market and the larger retailers there.  $10,000 bitcoin is coming, and probably by the time the next mining distribution halves. I wish I had the words to help people see what I see coming.  This will be life changing for many people. I suggest you be one of them.

This is what js haopening but it's not being clearly reported yet.  Some joker is using the transaction malability issue to cause multiple transactions into the bitcoin network by the thousands.  The blockchain.info blockchain browser reports them as a double spend.  It seems generally not harmful as both spends go to the same place and only one will be accepted but it's confusing and no doubt causing problems with some bitcoin services as there are thousands of these things.

I don't have to assume mismanagement, I can watch it happening.
I already gave you a related set of metrics (pulled from the book I mentioned previously):
A country currently printing fiat money, with debt to GNP over 80%, and deficit over 40% of government spending is at significant risk of currency failure/hyperinflation. These general numbers were found by observation of actual hyperinflations.
The background is government having large debt load to service, spending way more than it takes in, and printing to make the ends meet.  The feedback loop is the more the CB prints money and buys bonds the less economic agents want to hold bonds.  At the same time, the less economic agents want bonds, the more the CB has to buy them to fund government and service debt.
Right now our deficits might be manageable but our debt is too high and we're printing like some third world banana republic.  The key thing to watch is can the US stop printing.  If not, we're fucked, it's just a matter of how long until the end.

I think it would get coins into the hands of more people in more places.  It would give any individual an opportunity to get coin without needing outside exchange.  Consider gold (which bitcoin was modeled after)...  an individual can always go pan for gold even if big companies dominate gold mining.  This actually happened in Zimbabwe--some people actually went back to panning for gold when their currency collapsed.  The way bitcoin works the small guy gets completely locked out once the miners get too big.  I think that's not optimal, but I don't have an answer to the problem either.

No, it only needs to become a means of exchange... interacting not with fiat, but directly with people for goods and services.  Imagine there was no interaction with fiat....  does that changed anything?  Can't bitcoin still function as a store of value and means of exchange without fiat?   Isn't it only in your head that fiat must somehow be involved because that's how you currently value everything?  What if one day you valued things in bitcoin instead?
Previously if you bought shoes (for example) online from a foreign country it would price in the fiat local to the country then you'd use an exchange rate between your fiat and that fiat to find your price and then you'd exchange fiat (paying fees in the process) to pay for the shoes.  Today you can price and pay in bitcoin. Fiat doesn't need to come into play at all.  That is what is coming.  It takes out the moneychangers (and you don't have to pay their exchange fees).  You want to drag in wall street when in reality the advantage of bitcoin is it bypasses wall street.  Bitcoin is already there, the thing left to change is the minds of the actors in the market, specifically in how they value things.

The dollar signs in the sign are bitcoin values priced in dollars.  Bitcoin transaction is around 1 cent but that doesn't mean you literally pay a cent, you pay a cent worth of bitcoin.
I appreciate your point that some people would want to transfer fiat, and in that case it currently takes some effort to make bitcoin cheaper than WU and it certainly won't be as cheap as 1 cent but it is possible.  And its getting easier and cheaper every year.  But really that's not the important thing here...  the direction is to growth of bitcoin and that means fiat's market share diminishes over time.
Dollars are just one form of money, bitcoin is another.  There is no reason bitcoin can't be a common unit of exchange for ordinary people globally and there is certainly momentum/growth in that direction.  
WU transfers dollars, bitcoin transfers bitcoin.  Bitcoin does a much better and cheaper job of transfering its money than WU does of transferring its money.  Bitcoin is so good it can often convert to/from the money WU uses and STILL be cheaper than WU.  In all cases bitcoin is cheaper to transfer its own money.  Nobody even talks about using WU to transfer bitcoins because that would be absurdly difficult and expensive, yet that's the comparison you're holding bitcoin to.
Look at the growth and momentum and ask yourself where things are headed.  People want to save money.  They will go to where it is cheapest, which means they will move to bitcoin. They won't convert to/from fiat when they don't absolutely have to because its a waste of money.  In a few years this entire conversation will be moot because there will be plenty of places to use bitcoin, plenty of ways to get bitcoin, and no reason at all to bother with fiat conversion.  If you can't see that coming you should get your eyes checked ;)

This guy gets it.  This what I've been saying--bitcoin is not a cheaper paypal. Bitcoin is fundamentally different than existing payment systems and currency. It is deflationary, asset based rather than debt based, voluntary, decentralized, private,  etc. In short it's the complete opposite of today's financial system and currencies. It's benefits are not obvious to those who do not understand the issues with the current status quo financial system/currency. However bitcoin's benefits will become steadily more apparent as the existing system continues to rattle apart at the seams.

It's not enforceable because it's trivial to have people pay you to a private address you control and then you send those coins to coinbase as a personal transaction.  That way every payment into coinbase is just a transfer to yourself.  The same thing can happen with outgoing payments.

All these "bitcoin" investment funds are just making bitcoin move with the stock market. It correlates bitcoin to all the other wall street toys.  Traders panic on some foreign debt problem, like today, and bitcoin goes down with the market when it should be going up with gold. They might even be artificially expanding bitcoin liquidity with all their off-blockchain artificial bitcoin and keeping prices down. Whatever they are they are not bitcoin, you buy bitcoin and it's on the blockchain, these things are artificial bitcoin and are not on the blockchain... there's not a 21 million coin programmed limit on these things, it's limited only by what wall street can get away with and they can get away with a lot.

I didn't predict hyperinflation in 2010 nor did any book author I've mentioned.  My prediction is a dollar failure within 20 years (maybe sooner if the printing keeps up).  If I'm wrong about that, and I hope I am, I'll be glad to admit it.

It's not "our" responsibility.  The market, when left to actually work, addresses such nonsense.  Bad actors go bankrupt and get removed.  When you bail out the bad actors you reward them for their bad behavior which just generates more bad behavior.  Plus it lets the bad actors multiply and get bigger, causing even worse systemic problems in the future.  If we had let the bad banks fail earlier it wouldn't have been a big deal and the surviving banks would've been even more responsible.

It's the same for both: an equal 2% gain on their wealth.  Especially note how there is no transfer of wealth from one person to another.  This is completely fair.
However in an inflationary environment sophisticated people with money make a lot more from the inflation than poorer people who don't have the knowledge or sophistication to protect their wealth against inflationary losses.  And worse its an actual transfer of wealth.  In short, the guy with $100 in his bank account loses %3 a year while the rich guy using leveraged investments structured to take advantage of inflation capture that guy's lost 3% and then some. Note that inflation doesn't just make wealth vanish into thin air, it goes somewhere.  It's a transfer of wealth.  This is completely unfair.
To point you a bit in the right direction, in an inflationary environment the rich guy doesn't have a million in a bank account losing 3%, he has a leveraged debt of 4 million in investments that make money over and above the inflation rate.  I can point you to descriptions of the mathematics of how to capture gains from inflation using debt/leverage, taxes, etc.  (that actually come from the depreciation of money held by the poor and less sophisticated) if you wish.

We'll see if they can simply withdraw the trillions in base money. So far they haven't even been able to stop the printing nevermind reverse it. And for all the trillions created the current recovery has been incredibly weak, so weak they haven't dared turn off the presses and it's 6 years since 2008.  No recession in US history has dragged out like this.
Thanks for posting your deficit source, the number was so small because they're giving a gap sized by the entire economy (which is a great way to make a big gap look small). I'll post the fred chart when I get to my desk so we can see the gap sized by spending so it actually means something in terms of how out of control spending is vs income. But you are right it is declining as I told you myself previously. 
The rest of your post is content-free name calling. It's a waste of time with me as I'm not interested in labels, I'm interested in truth. I don't identify as  "Austrian" or "goldbug" or even "libertarian." I've made a lot of money on gold, silver and bitcoin because I saw their promise at the right times, but I'm also in the stock market and other more traditional arenas. I take what works and what is correct from any source and think people that focus on labels are fools cheering for their team while facts are ignored. So to me  and 4 only make you look foolish.
To me the likely future is a failing dollar because that's the direction we're going with increasing velocity and that's the lessons of history. Because of that future I see assets like bitcoin are key areas to watch. You've said nothing to make me think I'm wrong, you just sit there attacking all the most key and best returning assets of the last decade for what appear to me to be basically mindless religious reasons. You've missed 10000%+ gains on an important new tech, why? Because you think a deflationary currency (which is actually inflating and will be for over 100 years and maybe for its entire life) doesn't go with your label? Sounds foolish to me.

Not at all, my theory explains falling spot price just fine.  Backwardation is telling you there is something wrong with your theory.
Think of it in terms of bitcoin.  Price is set in the centralized exchanges right?  But that's not bitcoin, it's centralized nonsense.  What happens if people, especially the big holders, start to remove their bitcoin from the exchanges and keep their own private keys?  The remaining fools and their "bitcoin" on exchanges keep supposedly "setting price" but everyone else has lost trust in the exchanges and are holding their bitcoin themselves.  They can't even be coerced into putting their bitcoin in exchanges for a deposit bonus (that's what backwardation is, a sort of deposit bonus being ignored).  So what does price mean when the place price is set becomes irrelevant and isn't even where the real bitcoin is anymore?  What do I care as a holder of bitcoin if price on exchanges falls to near zero when you can't actually get any serious number of bitcoin for that price because there is basically no bitcoin in the exchange?  I know my bitcoin is worth more than that, I just have to wait for the nonsense in the exchanges to work itself out and for everyone else to wake up to the fact the price setting game in the exchanges is meaningless.

Absolutely.  It's the most widely used and most powerful currency ever.  Unfortunately it's not a question of power as much as corruption.  Fiat always goes the same way...  those that have control of the currency end up printing it and destroying it.  The dollar has gone down the same road and at a very similar pace as other powerful fiat currencies.  Maybe despite current problems it lasts for another 10 or 20 years because of its size and importance...  But the problems are significant and we're already seeing big players in the world start to abandon the dollar.  And we've also seen from 2008 that they will take the "easy" path of printing money when the trouble hits.  So IMO it's clear the dollar is doomed, it's just a question of how long they can push it before it falls.

Sorry but founding a company or putting in effort for it does not make it a safe venture.  Companies die every day with people founding and working hard in them.  I agree Gates made his money, but he made as much as he did by not following traditional investment advice that advises to stay diversified and rebalance.

If you make an account denominated in dollars and all the user sees is a fixed dollar value what does it matter if there are bitcoins underneath somewhere?  Why even bother?  Why would anyone even care it was a bitcoin business?  It might as well be a fiat business.  This is the stupidest bitcoin related idea I've heard in a long time.
If the account is valued in dollars the number of bitcoins you hold will change on a daily basis as the price of bitcoin changes against the dollar.  This means as the dollar inflates or bitcoins go up in value, the number of bitcoins you hold goes down (possibly by a LOT).  That negates a couple huge reasons why some of us buy bitcoin:  as a hedge against inflating fiat and as an investment in a new disruptive technology.  If anyone had done that over the last few years they'd have missed the THOUSANDS in percent gain that bitcoin has made in that time.  That would've been the stupidest move in your entire life.

You are apparently as ignorant of the history of bitcoin as you are about how to personally store bitcoin.

Yes, I'm aware of Buffet's view on gold.  Gold's thousands of years of history as money however holds a bit more weight than one man's viewpoint...  especially when gold performing badly helps many of that man's investments.  
There's also nothing in that article that specifically argues for gold currently being overvalued.  In particular to argue gold (or bitcoin) is "useless" ignores that gold (and bitcoin) have a use as money: they are an exchange and store of value.  That's a rather important and significant use, and in the case of gold has been used in that capacity for thousands of years.

Your practical argument is a bias you happen to have against cash-like transactions, not a problem with bitcoin.  Acting cash-like is rightly seen by many people as an advantage.  It's possible that you don't appreciate the advances and additional features that can be built around having a system that actually securely transfers digital property.  Perhaps you don't appreciate the differences between property and claims to property.
Stating that bitcoin needs to develop insurance, fraud protection, etc. isn't so much an argument against bitcoin as a statement of development and growth still to come in the bitcoin space.  That is unless you're going to argue such things will never happen, and you don't seem to do that.
Your technical argument is answered in any discussion of the scaling of bitcoin (some of which is being done right now).
Your economic argument isn't an argument it's an odd unsupported strawman attacking some unspecified "Austrians."
Your inflation argument is a problem with banks and how they might structure their bitcoin services, not a problem with bitcoin/digital property.  If you conflate property with claims-to-property you will get problems.  Or alternatively if you structure bitcoin into debt-based-fiat-like services it will have the problems of such fiat "assets."
Your final stability issue is the only actual argument that has any merit in my opinion (minus the comment about holding TIPS).  I think we can all agree bitcoin is volatile.

LOL, that was to set the value of the dollar, not the value of gold.  Gold has had value long before the US government existed.  My question is why does gold have value despite having no government behind it, not why does the dollar have value.  Initially the dollar has value because it was linked to gold (and in some cases it was literally gold).
Find the answer to that, you'll find the answer to why bitcoin has value without having a government behind it.

I say we make the regulations even more onerous. For example we can add the requirement that employees of bitcoin businesses must keep white tigers or some other endangered species. That way endangered species are helped. Of course nobody will actually comply with such stupid regulations but that's the point and is where this is all going anyway so we might as well make it clearer where it's headed.

Ok, let's consider what I might choose in the situation you're supposing.
I'm productive, I have ambitions, I'm not a loser--I choose to work and better myself.  I do this because I see that it is possible to be productive, better myself significantly and have it pay off over the significant personal costs of working.  The costs of working are significant--I get little time to myself and my family, there is a lot of stress, etc.  Currently I also see there is not much support for a satisfactory life if I'm not productive and support myself.  So I work and the economy and everyone in it is better for it.  Morally I sacrifice my own time and efforts for my own existence--this is as it should be.
However in the environment you suppose there is now a choice to not have to be productive and suffer fewer real consequences and coupled with the gains I get from not paying the costs of work, now the outcome is very different.  It's true I won't get nice toys, but I get more time to myself, my family, my interests--the things that really matter.  Couple that with the fact that if I do work I won't get as much payoff because the fruits of my labors will be taken by force to fund people who choose to not work.  In that environment I will chose to not work because that is the better option.  Why would I work?  Letting someone else fund my life which I can spend fully with my friends, family and personal interests would absolutely be better than having to give up my time to work then pay the majority of my salary to thugs in government who take my pay and give it to non productive people.  So I don't work, and the economy and everyone in it suffers for it.
As for the morality of forcing someone else to suffer and sacrifice their time and effort for my own existence...  well I find that immoral (an issue you ignore).  But if that's how the society is structured (I suppose because idiots without a clue have taken control of government) I will take advantage of it the same as everyone else and let others suffer for my benefit.  Of course that structure won't work long term and there will be an eventual collapse.  But I'll deal with that when it happens, the same as everyone else.

The dollar's use around the world is declining at a significant pace.  Its use as a reserve currency might be ending this decade.  As for the government accepting dollars for debts, the government IS the debtor so your comment makes little sense.  What you mean to say is the government can force taxes to be paid in dollars thus giving them an artificial "fiat" value (and then you'd be correct).  This of course ties the dollar to a government and governments have a finite life, as does that government's fiat.  As a result there has been no fiat in history that has lasted with most dying in less than a handful of decades.  The dollar has been a fully fiat currency since 1971 and the clock is ticking on it.
As for bitcoin, its value is based on the same thing gold's value is based: it has properties that make it well suited for use as a monetary commodity.  These are digital properties rather than physical as with gold, but the value remains...  and is even arguably greater than gold as bitcoin can do things gold cannot (e.g. being exchanged across the globe in seconds, cannot be confiscated, can be brought across borders privately and effortlessly, etc.).  The real value of bitcoin is not yet understood by hardly anyone, even most the people here (you are a perfect example of that).  However it will become understood as the dollar accelerates its failure (over the next 20 years or so based on my estimation).  As a result we're nowhere near a reasonable upside.  So no, I'm not looking to sell.

Unfortunately fiat money runs don't last that long and tend to die ugly.  So I'm watching and waiting for the various fiat monies currently in power to go into their death throes.  Part of that is watching the alternative moneys, especially the honest ones like bitcoin that are likely to outlast fiat.

Here's the chart showing deficit gap I promised:
[FRED Graph](
Currently the gap is around 15% of spending.  In 2009 it was nearly 40% of spending which historically is a very dangerous level  (a 50% gap would mean you're spending twice what you're taking in).  Of course the entire chart shows we're constantly spending more than we take in and the gap must be funded by debt or printing.  Certain levels of debt and deficit are manageable but historically once a country is printing and has debt and deficit that reach certain levels there is no recovery... the high spending and debts cause a negative feedback loop with further printing and the currency is doomed.  We are right now printing and have debts over historical critical levels.  We had a bush with death in the last crisis and though deficits have become better due to the up turn we're still printing and the next downturn to come might be even worse as we've already gone to historical lengths to try to recover from the last one and the recovery simply hasn't been strong enough to even stop the printing yet.
From nearly a thousand years of fiat currency history we can see that fiat currency has a life span that can be measured in a handful of decades in the best cases and usually less than that.  The fiat dollar is now 43 years old and the fact that we're printing trillions in base money highly suggests we've entered the end game.  Unfortunately I feel the odds are very high that I'm watching the dollar play out its final decade (though maybe we'll get two more decades).  
So once again, bitcoin is very a timely and incredibly important innovation.  I understand the skepticism but the promise of bitcoin in the face of our failing dollar future makes it a critical asset to watch--absolutely critical.

Gold spot price is irrelevant.  Spot price is the paper price of gold as derived by the derivatives market.  When physical gold starts to break away from the paper market (which is what backwardation is), spot price might drop very low even as real gold completely is removed from the market until it can't be bought for fiat at all anymore (at which point its fiat price basically becomes infinite).

There were a lot of duplicate transactions created that had nothing to do with gox withdrawals.  If the transaction malleability was being used to steal from gox then I'd expect whoever was behind it was making a lot more duplicate transactions than just those they were using to steal as a means of hiding what they were doing.  
Bottom line the only way to know for sure what went on is to get transaction records from gox.  And that's assuming they were on the ball enough to actually keep records of the failed transactions and not just the successful ones.  Given how inept they have been I wouldn't be surprised if they don't have the records to sort this mess out.  Apparently they weren't even checking customer balances in their cold wallets.

I've made the same argument about alternative crypto in the past but now I don't think it's accurate.  There are competing physical forms of money (e.g. gold, silver, fiat) and one taking over another in a society obviously doesn't mean all physical currency then fail.  There is a complex ecosystem of possible monies out there always competing and the most "fit" at the time will rise to the top.  Bitcoin is now part of that competition and is rising because it's a better fit for the digital part of the ecosystem that fiat.  Because the money ecosystem is complex there are many areas in it--and each area could be dominated by a different money, well have to see how it works out.  Regardless I don't see the rise of any particular money meaning other similar monies must fail.  We simply don't observe that with current monies.  We see silver and gold; we see the dollar and the euro; etc., etc.

I'm aware what fractional reserve lending is.  And I'm aware it's failed in the past multiple times with assets like gold just as it would with bitcoin.  This is because the "piece of paper" is a debt instrument that relies on trust, third parties and can default while neither gold nor bitcoin have any of those liabilities.  Eventually times get risky and people want their gold/bitcoin over the debt instrument and the debt expansion scheme collapses.
Also note that the need for a bank and debt instrument is not there like it was for gold.  Gold has many problems that make it difficult to easily use:  it's difficult to store, secure, validate, divide, carry, etc.   Banks and their debt instruments came into being to solve those problems.  Bitcoin does not have the problems gold had.  With bitcoin there is much less need for people to turn banks and their debt expansion schemes.

If you expand the date range to monthly on those charts you'll see prices have about doubled on corn and soybeans since 2007 and wheat is up about double from 2005.  Doubling in 7 years is over 10% annual inflation and a lot closer to shadowstats than CPI. If you want worse look at education costs or healthcare or childcare or oil or etc, etc.

I completely disagree.  Why is some arbitrary price level a good reason to sell?  For anyone who has made a significant amount of money from an investment at some point in their lives I can guarantee you they did not do it by following that advice.  
Bitcoin has the best potential of any investment I've seen.  I am not going to blow the best opportunity of my life.  I will sell when (1) I have something better to put the money in or (2) my fundamental view for the likely upside has largely been met.  Neither are remotely close to happening.

Because fiat constantly loses value it forces savers to be investors and the two concepts get conflated, just as your comment implies. But investing and saving are not the same. Investing is not better or worse than saving, it's different with its own advantages and disadvantages. Investing forces you to put money at risk, to give others your wealth to use and trust them to get it back to you. Saving keeps your wealth in your own control, risk free. Unfortunately with fiat true saving is not possible as money is actually controlled by government and is constantly devalued and can never really be held just under your control--it cannot be saved in any meaningful sense it can only be invested.  Bitcoin does not have that problem, it can be saved. And sometimes saving really is the better option, e.g. during times of crisis or uncertainty, especially government or financial system instability.  It's no coincidence that bitcoin was created during exactly that sort of period of crisis.

There are several reasons the expansion of the monetary base has not (yet) caused general price inflation to the level you might expect. First is because they are doing it to fight an increase in deflation from many sources  (collapsing debt, falling velocity, etc) which pushes inflation down. Another reason is they often try to direct the money created in such a way that it doesn't get to the general public and raise general inflation through a process called "sterilization." Basically what sterilization does is keep the money in the banking system (by the Fed offering higher risk free interest rates to banks to basically buy back the money they created) so banks lend it back to the Fed rather than out to the public causing general inflation. The result is banks make smaller risk free profits (and the stock market booms and the wealth disparity increases), while ordinary folks are seeing continued unemployment and decreasing wages as it apparently hasn't helped cause a general recovery as well as they had hoped. 
QE is supposed to end in a few weeks so we'll see if the stock market crashes or if they decide to continue QE or what.  I'm also not sure if they intend to try to reduce the monetary base or just try to keep it in the banking system or what. I don't expect they'll be able to stop QE without everything falling apart again let alone be able to reverse the monetary base expansion. Money printing becomes difficult to stop once you start.

Regulated might mean expensive and controlled by government... it might mean high barriers for entry...  it might even mean corrupted.  But it does not mean accountable and safe (or did you not even notice 2008 to say nothing of all the shenanigans still going on?).  Bitcoin services need to be made accountable and safe and that is being worked on right now.  Luckily because of the blockchain and cryptography, accountability and security are built in if the right techniques are developed and used.  What we need is to develop new techniques to account and secure bitcoin using what bitcoin provides, not rely on old systems like regulation that we know don't work.  Bitcoin is still developing and what is coming will allow for much more than regulation ever could ... and ironically one of the biggest threats to that progress IS regulation.
Bitcoin has already done what nobody thought was possible: it proved a practical distributed, trustless system of p2p digital property exchange.  That system works by mathematical rule not governmental regulation.  Let bitcoin continue to develop it's higher level systems built on these new technologies.  Regulation won't improve bitcoin, but it might destroy it.

People that understand the point that custodial exchanges are against bitcoin principles weren't caught in the gox mess.  You claim everyone got caught but that's false--a lot of people didn't.  People that understand what bitcoin is and why it was created didn't leave anything in gox (or not more than a token amount). We told people to avoid gox and got downvoted for it by people that didn't know better.  But next time this sort of thing happens there will be more educated people and less downvoting of the truth.  And existing systems will improve to reduce the chance of a next time.
These arguments going on now are for the people that don't understand bitcoin and they are learning what bitcoin is and why it exists.  In the US people are babied and they are largely clueless about money and risk and have a lot to learn. In places like Cyprus there is no such argument going on over bitcoin, they know the benefits of bitcoin from first hand experience.

Loans and asset-based money like bitcoin/gold are not interchangeable and do not serve the same purpose.  Loans generally don't act like cash or property, they require trusted 3rd parties to manage, and in particular they can DEFAULT.  Gold and bitcoin can't default, that's what makes them top tier monies.  Increasing the number of bitcoin loans would not inflate the supply of bitcoin just as the government increasing paper dollars behind gold didn't increase the supply of gold.  Instead a disparity between dollars and gold happened as people start demanding gold over the much more risky paper.  The result is the government actually had to default on its gold debts twice (in 1933 and 1971) finally removing gold from official money altogether.  You keep trying to conflate debt and property but they are not remotely the same.
Your comments on gold are just odd.  Go read a book on the history of money sometime and you'll find out gold is not money only when governments mandate it.  Gold has been used as money by the market itself for thousands of years—government mandates or not.
Your views on "modern finance" seem to be completely unaware that how we got to this "modern" system was by a series of gold DEFAULTS, not by some planned design.  Our money system no longer has any final top tier asset money to actually close out loans because the government defaulted on those obligations, twice.  So now we are left using a debt-based money (a remnant of those gold money defaults) and have grown economic schools of thought around a money system we were forced into by government misuse and irresponsibility.   Our money now depends on market faith, trust, and the solvency of government, can be manipulated by authorities, can be defaulted on, etc.  You want to imagine such money is the same as actual property, but it's not.  If I have a gold coin or a bitcoin, those things cannot default, don't require trusted parties, are no one else's liability, etc.  That's what the real top-tier money used to be before the government started becoming too irresponsible to manage a system with actual assets behind it and were forced into changing the system over several crises.
Now with bitcoin we have an actual asset-based money again.  It's used by people who choose to use it, it's not mandated by government (the same as gold has been for most of its history).  This money is quite different than fiat, loans, and other debt-based instruments that require trust and can default.  If financial parties create loans and other derivatives from bitcoin it will make new markets for those second tier money substitutes, it won’t inflate bitcoin.  This is because second tier monies AREN’T interchangeable with top tier monies.  You’re just not aware of this as you haven’t seen a top tier money (that you recognized) before, have never been educated on such things, and apparently don’t understand what they are.

Government is not a productive sector.  Finance is NET non productive--the "service" they provide and export does not make up for the drain/damage/debt-enslavement done to the economy especially taking into account the productive sectors lost as it has grown.  Our best and brightest no longer go to work putting men on the moon or solving the world's problems, they go to wall street to figure out new ways to scalp money away from other traders and those that actually work for a living.
I didn't imply wage stickiness isn't a thing.  It's a thing, it's just not a big enough thing to justify robbing the population, shrinking the productive sector, and eventually destroying the currency over.
I'm not surprised you think deflation is bad, nor am I surprised you don't have the balls to acknowledge the honest debate on the subject across economics.
I didn't say we're at a crisis point. My own view is we're about 10 to 20 years from a crisis. Current budget deficit is not bad enough yet (though it was getting bad FAST during the 2008 crisis). We've got another decade or two going down the same road we've been on of growing debt and deficit before we get caught in negative feedback loops that will take down the currency. Of course things can change fast, especially for a country currently actively printing trillions.
Given such minor side points are all you have to say on my comment, I'll consider it a success.

I have no problem with the bitcoin foundation and other large holders selling. Bitcoin needs to be in more people's hands and the less in the hands of the foundation the better. I'd rather they sell here than when price is at $6000 as someone else said. If that means lower prices for a while then so be it. More time for me to get more coins cheaper.

Nobody is stopping anyone from doubting. Go ahead and doubt, or be conservative or whatever you want. But the fact that he could be wrong doesn't mean he is wrong. It doesn't even mean he should acknowledge that he might be wrong. He is doing what leads to winning--even if it doesn't win this time, he did the right thing.

The really terrifying lesson there is how long a broke government can last by slowly removing the freedoms (and wealth) of its people. This period of financial decline and eventual failure in Roman times lasted longer than the US has existed as a country. Those that predict a financial failure or revolution in a decade or two (and this includes myself) need to be aware the Roman example shows decline can drag on for hundreds of years if people accept the loss of freedoms and allow their own military/police to dominate them.

You have a mistaken notion that use = value and use only means selling. Use is also holding until fair value is reached. Value is in the minds of holders of an object. Price is the value level that entices holders to sell their object. These prices do not entice me to sell. I am not confused that somehow selling my coins at these low prices gives them higher value.

Altcoins are a problem.  Altcoins sit there having to sell the claim bitcoin needs to be "fixed." They sow doubt while draining focus and resources from bitcoin and all for nothing as they are all doomed to fail one way or another. None can succeed (at least in this early stage of crypto-currency) because if an altcoin succeeds over bitcoin it demonstrates no coin is safe as any coin could be supplanted by a new coin and thus destroys the confidence in all coins. 
However having said that I think bitcoin will thrive despite altcoin bullshit. No alt will succeed even if it is supposedly better. Bitcoin doesn't have to be the best, it just has to work well enough and get the attention and network effect. The masses don't care about what nerds think is best, they care that something works and is popular. 
If you are in an altcoin you will be pumped and dumped--making money for an early minority is all alts are good for. Truth hurts, but this is the truth.

First you argue bitcoin hasn't moved for months, then you argue it's volatile.  Then you argue it's fallen to half its peak, next you argue it's up 50x times from 2 years ago.  It's volatile, it doesn't move, it's down, it's up...  Rather than try to make sense of your contradictory claims let's simply look at a longer term price chart rather than shorter term fluctuations.  There we'll see the current price movements are fully in line with the high rate of growth of bitcoin and its price.

In a longer scale timeline (not cherry picked points based on recent highs), the earlier someone has bought the more they have made.  Assuming they of course they held it safely and didn't sell it, lose it trading, have it stolen by hackers or bad exchanges, etc.  Bitcoin has been among the best investments in the world on an annual basis since it was invented in 2009.  And it's been easy to make money in bitcoin if you simply buy and hold safely, but most people can't seem to do that...  and practically speaking its been very difficult to make money for most people.
If you want to do well in bitcoin it's easy:  buy now, put into paper wallet, forget about it for a few years.

large investment groups like that are ruled by group-think...  for them it's all about rebalancing, MPT, or whatever the of the group has decided is what to advise at this time.  Unfortunately for all investors that want to be educated and do better than average, markets function in a perverse manner where the majority will under-perform at the expense of a minority.  The way to succeed is to avoid doing what everyone else is doing...  but that flies in the face of going to some big group and getting their input on how to beat the market.
The bottom line is almost by definition big groups like that will not produce good advice to beat the market, unless you listen to them in order to do the opposite.  The larger group there will not be advising to get into bitcoin until the chance to beat the market in bitcoin has mostly (or completely) past.
Of course if what you want to do is hit average to below average, you're good to go in that place.

Those services use fiat and so they suck compared to bitcoin. Bitcoin can be used for secure wealth storage but they cannot as they use a centralized derivative of a depreciating asset called fiat that cannot be depended on for wealth storage.  Those services also can be reversed and have various transaction restrictions and lack of privacy that makes them a joke for secure wealth exchange compared to bitcoin.
Yes those fiat based systems are probably good for moving little bits of fiat around better, but so what, it's fiat that is the problem bitcoin really solves.

Think of bitcoin as a sort of digital land.  There are only 21 million plots of this land.  Though it's easy to exchange ownership of the plots, and divide them into smaller sub-plots, there is a limited amount of real estate that can be owned.

Exactly! 
At the moment most people are still stuck on thinking about how to buy/sell bitcoin, how many dollars they can make off a rise in bitcoin, and other aspects of bitcoin that are really about fiat and miss the real point.  What if you don't convert to fiat? What if people more and more just stay in bitcoin? Compare the freedom and ease of use of bitcoin to fiat and all its fees, controls, and restrictions. Why bother with fiat at all once bitcoin gets bigger?  
It's not a perfect comparison but...  
Do you want to use existing techology airports with their body scans, document checks, pat downs, long lines, and fees per bag, to get somewhere slowly via a crowded metal tube with wings where you are fed peanuts? Or do you want to use the new technology personal transporter you keep in your pocket and use anytime you want as you wish without having to get anyone's permission? That's the difference in the monetary world between bitcoin and fiat at least once you completely get away from fiat.

If money was bitcoin (or gold or burgers) then creating a loan would obviously not create more bitcoin (or gold or burgers).  It would create a loan contract. The contract would have a value but it's a contract not money (bitcoin).  The number of bitcoins is unchanged.  You might call the loan a money substitute, but you couldn't say it was money as it wasn't bitcoin.
Fiat money today is a debt-based representational thing...  it's very different from bitcoin.  You can put your dollars in the bank and the bank will loan them out while still promising to return your dollars to you on demand without creating a loan contract.  The dollars loaned out can be returned to the bank and loaned out again and again.  Many people can basically lay claim to ownership of the same dollar (which originally came into existence by being borrowed anyway so it was never an asset, it's a debt) and there is no way for anyone to tell.  For money of that nature loans can increase the money supply.  This kind of thing is highly unlikely to happen to bitcoin for a number of reasons but perhaps the most obvious reason is there can be only one owner of a the private key for bitcoin just like only one person can hold a physical gold coin.  The owner of a bitcoin (or a gold coin or a burger) is obvious.
As long as you keep thinking in the fiat system and trying to jam bitcoin into that system I think you will remain confused.  Bitcoin is not fiat money.  It is not debt-based or a representational money.  It works (and doesn't work) differently than fiat.

Thanks.  The exchange rate of bitcoin doesn't matter that much once you stop thinking about exchanging bitcoin for some fiat.  The dollar changes value every day against Euros and other currencies and few people care because they don't exchange dollars for other currencies.  When a more complete economic system is built-up around bitcoin, you won't need to exchange bitcoin for anything and the variation against other currencies suddenly won't matter much.

And now you're making the "features" argument for altcoins.  That's the argument I normally hear and with the essay I now have a clear way to judge it.  Rather than being worried about what "features" might lead to a bitcoin replacement I can simply look at liquidity. Are any altcoins actually winning the liquidity war against bitcoin?  Not currently.  So apparently there is no altcoin with significant features to challenge bitcoin at this point... so putting speculative money into any of them would be a mistake (unless I was just doing it for fun or something).  Liquidity is a very simple and clear metric and I'm convinced by the author's arguments there.

We're in a significant price pullback... perhaps the biggest one since the drop from $35 to under $10 that lasted for a year. It takes time but price bottoms out and volume dries up during the bottoming out. This is normal market behavior. Volume will turn around again but after we've bottomed out and started back up in price and that might not be for some months yet.

The entire point is bitcoin gives you the tools to avoid shit like this. Sure you can be an idiot and give your coins to some third party, but you don't have to.  With the fiat system you can't avoid having your money at the mercy of third parties.  With fiat you don't own squat--the enire currency itself is owned and controlled by a third party (a government), and even if you lock "your" cash in a box the government can (and does) steal the value of that cash from you as it sits in the box.  
Bitcoins are owned by you.  You can control them as you wish; keep them as you wish; transfer them as you wish.   All without a bank, government or trusted 3rd party required.  This is very different from fiat.

Hyperbitcoinization (rapid monetization of bitcoin) does not require the failure of any fiat currency.

A block explorer is not a critical decentralized component of bitcoin.

In my opinion people in gox weren't using bitcoin.  They were using goxcoins.

If these people were using bitcoin and the blockchain their bitcoins would still be secure.

Besides, the CPI numbers reported at the link you provide are "managed" numbers.

I agree with you.  There is another subtle point very few people understand.  It's no accident gold is a mostly useless metal whose value is mostly derived from its monetary use.  A good monetary commodity MUST be largely useless--this is because an important commodity that is also a monetary commodity causes many problems and simply doesn't work.  To see why suppose for example wheat was used as money.  Now when wealthy people horded excess wealth as wheat-money they would be infringing on the world--they would be immorally sitting on useful resources people needed to survive and the result would be uprisings.  Gold and bitcoin are useless and have no such problem and can be saved/horded with no significant impact on the world.  Also if wheat were money, its exchange value would be impacted by supply/demand issues of a useful commodity making its money price unnecessarily volatile.
Gold is a largely useless metal and bitcoin is a mostly useless bit of digital property that exists on the blockchain.  Their practical use (and thus "intrinsic value" apart from monetary use) is small.  This is not a disadvantage, it is actually an important property that makes them good money.

And that's exactly what won't happen with bitcoin.  Ownership of bitcoin is clear and unambigious.  You control the private key or you don't have the bitcoin.  Banks might loan bitcoin but those loans are loans and will not conflate with bitcoin the same way debt and dollars so easily conflate.  You have to go back to money as gold coins to get a better idea what it might be like with bitcoin as money.  And even that's not right as gold coins could never move, divide, travel, and store like bitcoin can.

You think it's "going fine" because you likely don't know what actually goes on with it.

No, it hasn't been in backwardation for years.  Look at the following chart of gold forwards as a basic proxy for backwardation (backwardation is when the line drops below 0):
Click on the 5Y (5 year) view to see what has been going on.  We've been near backwardated since 2008 but beyond a dip right at the Lehman collapse we've been barely in contango.  Enough gold holders have been putting up their gold to keep us near 0.  However since about mid 2013 we've been cycling back and forth between contango and a shallow backwardation...  so things got a bit worse. This has been the longest period of backwardation recorded but it's shallow and not constant.  
If you listen to Fekete he is clear to point out that he is talking about *permanent* backwardation, meaning it goes into backwardation and continues getting further backwardated causing a negative feedback loop of entities going into physical gold and pulling gold from derivative markets.  This continues until the fiat system collapses or is significantly changed somehow.   You can get a quick overview here (I'm sure there's better but that's what I found in 1 minute of looking):
Notice on that chart however that since about mid October we've recently gone from cycling around 0 to a significant plunge lower...  to levels not seen in over a decade.  And unlike previous spikes lower there is no obvious crisis behind this spike lower in the news (except maybe the Swiss initiative?).  This seems to be insiders that know something and are pulling their gold from the markets.  It's possible this was the Swiss initiative and it will recover, but it's also possible we've started something that will continue to get worse and then get VERY ugly for the fiat system.  Whatever it is I'm watching it carefully and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Large holders of physical gold I'm sure are very aware what is going on, and if more of them get spooked this might head into Fekete's negative feedback loop.
Also note that gold price is irrelevant.  Spot price is not the value of gold, it's the value of gold derivatives.  Gold derivatives will usually price gold correctly...  except during a breakdown of physical and derivatives, which is exactly what this is.  That's why you have to watch gold basis to see what is really happening.  Spot gold price (of derivatives) might continue to fall even as gold goes into hiding.  See this recent post of mine for more on that.

Try to do it and see for yourself.  I believe this is common knowledge with BTC-E (though I could be wrong as I don't use the exchange).
Downvoters:  If you can do it, do it.  I say you can't, at least not enough to make it worth the risk.  If you could then people would be doing it and there wouldn't be such a large price disparity between BTC-E and the other exchanges.

I'm responding to your arguments.  If you're going to argue altcoins are for R&amp;D then they shouldn't be priced as bitcoin alternatives but as R&amp;D tools.  If you're instead going to argue that they are bitcoin alternatives and the market will decide their value, then I agree with you--and the market is deciding no altcoin has liquidity anywhere near bitcoin (and the likely outcome of that is going to be a lot of money lost in the altcoin space).  You're of course free to have a different opinion but you're not making any arguments that aren't dismissed clearly by the original essay.

You're talking about a level of value bitcoin has already reached. We can already go buy little consumer junk with bitcoin--that future already arrived.  That's why bitcoin is worth $385 now. I'm looking ahead to tomorrow's value. Tomorrow bitcoin will be able to move value in the billions, but it cannot do that today because it's entire market cap is only 5 billion. Price must rise for that future to come to pass, so I hold in anticipation of that future. And in holding for that future, I and others like me make that future happen.

From my experience it made noticeably less over time and I dropped it.  I presumed that was due to its odd strategies (e.g. short blocktimes) that allow it to be p2p.  I don't think I'm the only one to have found it useless by comparison to a well run pool.

Right, you already made the point about "reliable" when my word was "good."  You think extreme increases in value and usage every year is somehow not "good" if it means there is short term volatility (which has no choice but to happen given how young bitcoin is and how much it still has to grow).  You're free to your opinion.
As for the fiat dollar, it only has around 40 years of history.  And if all the years of fiat history shows anything it shows fiat has a lifespan on the order of a handful of decades at most.  If you're not worried about the dollar existing in another 20 years maybe you can find another example of a fiat currency that has lasted in any meaningful way more than 60 years?  That should be easy, right?  Fiat is so safe it must have a stellar track record you can show us all.  Be sure to start in China over 700 years ago... that first fiat didn't even last 2 decades.  If you fail to find a fiat currency that lasted over 60 years as I expect, maybe you can tell us the average historical lifespan of fiat currency instead.  You can probably find that.

In the future bitcoin will be just as easy while having lower fees and more things it can do while giving you more control.  You're at the start of a revolution, you have to have an eye for what is coming.
However even now bitcoin is better for a lot of things.  Try sending money overseas on a Sunday sometime and you'll quickly find out how much better bitcoin is.  Also if your account ever gets frozen by some bank/corporation you'll appreciate bitcoin as an option where you are in control.

Not in the same way fiat is faith-based.  Fiat is a centralized, managed money.  It is not rare; it only has the properties of money because some authority has decreed it to be that way.  It acts as money so long as it is managed well and that authority stays in good standing (and historically that doesn't last more than a handful of decades).
Like gold, bitcoin's value comes from its natural properties that make it useful as a means of exchange and store of value.  It doesn't require any authority to decree that it be used.  The market chooses it because it is a good money naturally.  Nobody has to have faith that bitcoin is a good money and thus has value, they can observe it has the properties of good money and that the market chooses it and gives it value.  This is very different from fiat.

Not all economists are the same.  There are different schools of economics.

Every failed fiat in history has had reasonably competent authorities with no interest in the collapse of the currency, and yet that doesn't stop the inevitable.  The only constant is every fiat in history has eventually failed, most within a few decades.  The question isn't if, the question is when.  For the US dollar the clock started in the 70's under Nixon. The main indicators to watch are budget deficit and debt level.  US debt is already at failure levels, we're just waiting on deficit to get a bit worse.  Recently the stock market gains and related tax income turned the deficit around from critical levels (and there has been increased focus on stopping tax evasion), but these are short term things.  The next down turn will likely push the deficit back to death watch levels again.  When debt and deficit reach certain levels history shows us monetary failure is not far behind, regardless of the interests of the authorities.  If they were truly competent and interested in avoiding failure, they have never got to these critical levels in the first place.  At this point the damage is already largely done and we're just waiting for the fat lady to sing.  I anticipate the death spiral to be underway within the next two decades.  It might get delayed but given the direction the Fed takes when crisis hits, it doesn't look like it.

The long term loss in value of our fiat currency is not a measure of the economy failing or succeeding.  It's a measure of how the currency is failing to hold any value in the long term.  Economic failure is more likely to be associated with a short-term failure of value in a currency, and that can happen to (and is happening in many places in the world today).

No, he still argues bitcoin won't work because it has no intrinsic value.  He thinks the future is gold or a gold-backed currency of some sort.  Here's his view on bitcoin from a video today:
Schiff is hung up on the fact gold had some small value as a pretty (though largely useless) chunk of metal even before it became money.  But clearly the vast majority of gold's value comes from its properties that make it a good monetary commodity.  I think he's in for a surprise when the market chooses bitcoin over gold because bitcoin does everything gold can plus a whole lotta things gold cannot.  As a result bitcoin not only has intrinsic value as a (digital) monetary commodity, it arguably has higher intrinsic value than gold because it is a better monetary commodity.

The US hasn't tapped their gold in the slightest.  It sits in a sealed vault that hasn't been opened in decades and it remains on the books valued at only $42 per oz (the value of gold at the time the US defaulted on its gold obligations).  Officially gold remains insignificant to US monetary policy.
However the reality is the US has the largest gold reserves in the world (as far as anyone knows anyway) and the world is aware of that.  If gold ever comes back into the monetary picture in a significant way, the US gold could come out and into play again.

I've been thinking about your comment the last few days and think I can now explain clearly why its hogwash.
Collateral might back loans and support the banking system, but it does not back the dollar.  The collateralized banking system requires both collateral AND sound money to operate.  Collaterallized loans use currency to denominate the collateral value and thus the collateral cannot be the support for the currency when it requires a sound currency for the loan to operate in the first place.  This is trivially shown by considering what happens to loans in the case of hyperinflation (or other currency failure):  the collateral still exists but the money itself fails making the loan a loss for the bank as it can be trivially paid off in devalued currency.  Historically when money starts failing banks stop or modify lending to avoid losses associated with currency risk.  Clearly a government can mismanage its currency independent of the fact the currency is used in collateralized loans, and those loans won't stop the currency from failing at all (as history shows in hundreds of cases of currency failure).  So any argument that money is somehow supported by collateral used in the banking process is nonsense.

Back when few people had email addresses there might have been a service that could receive emails and convert them into snail-mail for a fee and vice versa to send/receive with people that didn't have email yet.  Like that sort of service, bitcoin exchanges provide a bridge between the old and the new.  It might be difficult to imagine now but as bitcoin matures the importance of such a service will decline.  Andreas clearly sees that future.

Governments will not choose bitcoin because they can't control/manage it. Bitcoin is not compatible with fiat so no government using fiat will go that direction as they would lose power. Governments will likely continue playing fiat games while bitcoin use will come from the people/businesses.
And your own description describes why no whale is likely to buy the bitcoin exchange float...  why would a whale spend millions to jack the price of an asset where billions are held off exchange? As they try to take control it just makes price more expensive for them and makes competing whales out of many already in the asset they are buying. No, a whale wanting in would try to make off exchange buys from large coin holders or other strategies that avoid moving price.  Look at China and gold... China is aggressively accumulating gold and has been for years but does so carefully with minimal effect on price.

If armies could actually give value to money any number of economies and their currencies wouldn't have failed through history, including Rome.

There is a finite amount of gold in the earth (just as there are a finite amount of bitcoin programmed to be mined).  Do I really have to explain why the amount of gold mined must eventually decline?  Actually I believe we've already hit "peak gold" and mining production has been in decline for years now despite improvements in mining production.
As for deflation, bitcoin is still in its inflationary stage.  Later when it starts to significantly deflate, if it becomes apparent it should instead continue to inflate that's a change that can be made (like was done to dogecoin).  I actually expect that will happen a few decades from now.  
In the meantime I wouldn't put too much stock in current economists bitching against deflation.  The economists currently in power are in power because their arguments support what is convenient for the powers that be and the systems they have implemented.  The reality is deflation is completely incompatible with a constantly expanding debt-based currency like we have now.  The dollar and our current system cannot continue in the form it does now in a deflationary environment, period.  The savings (or "hoarding" as they negatively call it) that is rewarded by deflation causes debt expansion to stop, pyramids of debt to default in cascades, and the fiat system to collapse.  This is not a failure of deflation, it's a failure of systems of ever-expanding debt. However there are other systems--in particular bitcoin isn't debt-based nor is gold, and neither suffer the same issues from deflation as debt-based fiat.

Bitcoin does not work at any value. For example right now bitcoin cannot be used for even a single large value business transaction like the buying/selling of a business, sports team, cruise ship, etc because the value of such things are larger than than the entire active float of the bitcoin market (and some are larger than the entire value of all bitcoin). Bitcoin is tiny in comparison to large scale businesses, financial portfolios, government reserves, etc. If bitcoin is to be more than a consumer toy it must rise in price by orders of magnitude.

Why would people saving bitcoin cause any economic problem?  That's a fallacy.  In our current broken economy debt is fueling expansion but that is not sustainable.  In correctly functioning economy saving is what drives later investment.  Eventually capital comes back into the economy and is put to work.  If the saving is significant and causes the money to gain in value (deflation) it just moves the time for capital to eventually come back into the economy forward.

I can't give you a decade of education on gold in a couple reddit posts. Just know that the dislocation of physical gold from spot price has been expected to happen by many of us even back when gold was rising. And we knew what to watch for to know that dislocation was happening.  I've explained it to you here in a Cliffs Notes version and you're free to disregard it as you wish--it's no skin off my nose. 
There is a window that has been expected to happen during the early part of the dislocation where Spot price will drop while small physical gold retailers haven't yet figured out that large physical gold holders are withdrawing their gold (and causing backwardation) and they will sell small gold at discount prices even as gold is becoming invaluable.  I don't know if this is the window, but it's going exactly as expected so far. In short I'm not worried about a falling gold price as gold goes into a curious  backwardation, I've been waiting for it for over 10 years.
Be warned that you cannot take advantage of this by buying an ETF, futures or other such derivative. Only physical gold will go on this ride, all the paper claims will default or settle for the low cash value of spot price.  That's how this works. That's what happens when paper claims to gold are 100 times the amount of real gold that exists. 99% of the players in gold have to get fucked.

We've all been skeptical and not invested in bitcoin at one point.  So no, I'm not surprised at all how bitcoin appears to people that aren't invested, but in my mind things change significantly with education (except for those heavily invested in the current financial structure, e.g. Warren Buffet).  So for the supposedly educated trolls in here (and yes you are trolls because normal people don't hang around forums on subjects they hate), I don't get it.  "It" being both why you don't see bitcoin's potential, and why you're a troll/socially disturbed individual.

Part of the problem might be incentives (or lack of).  Bitcoin got expensive fast, becoming a developer now doesn't pay.  Last  year interested parties jumped on mining not development because that is what paid.  Now bitcoin mining is too competitive and interested parties are making their own coins instead of developing bitcoin.  Why develop for bitcoin to make someone else rich?  Make a better coin instead.  This is why the altcoin boom--it's where the incentives are.
Bottom line the early adopters sitting on mass coin are the ones with incentive, development (or new types of incentives) will have to come from them.  If you are sitting on millions in bitcoin you will have to share the wealth somehow to bring people in.  You guys should be throwing coin around not sitting on it.  Do it now before some altcoin does it better.

It's worse than that--no doubt some idiots will borrow someone else's confidence, buy in, and then when things get tough lose confidence and bail out at just the wrong time and lose money even on a bet that eventually wins big. That's exactly what happens on every market bull to most people.  If the confidence doesn't come from you, you won't be able to ride the bull, it will buck you off.  But so what?  Because losers exist (and in fact most people are losers) a guy with the attitude that wins shouldn't display that attitude?  He doesn't care.  And he shouldn't care.
He's confident in his conviction and doing what that confidence implies which leads to his success in the case when he's right.  If you doubt and waffle, and don't do what will lead to success then even in cases you were right you didn't succeed (and you end up being one of the many people kicking themselves later).
Winners win, losers loser, and usually for good reason.  Most people lose, which means the most common ways of thinking about things...  the things that seem obvious and common sense... actually lead to losing.  He displaying to you a mindset that though it won't always win at least it can win.  Instead of attacking his attitude, you might listen to what he's saying and think about what it means and what it leads to and why.  What happens 5 years from now if he was right?  And if he was wrong, so what?  Other opportunities are always out there (thought admittedly not with the chances I think bitcoin has).
Nobody gives a shit if you win or lose.  It's all up to you.  You do what wins or you don't.  Most people don't.  Most people see what wins and think there's a problem with it, that's why they don't do it.

Look to discussions on gold as gold has similar properties. The reality is gold has been successful currency for thousands of years as well as a store of value. What gold didn't have (as far as I know) was an "early adopter period" where there was a lot of value to be made by riding the one-time, rapid value-increase that happens during adoption. Bitcoin the last few years and right now is an extremely rare opportunity, one you won't find often in your life (if ever). It's like someone invented gold but most people don't know it yet so it's available for $1/oz or $10/oz instead of the $1200/oz it will be later. That people will doubt it will be worth that much or will bitch about how unfair it is that some people got to buy at cheaper values than others doesn't mean it won't happen.

It's irrelevant if we know exactly how much gold there is.  It's a finite amount, just as there are a finite amount of bitcoin.  The original point was bitcoin is like gold not like fiat cash. Fiat cash has no production limits.  Current fiat cash is debt-based, bitcoin is not.
As for your supposed experience with bitcoin and deflation, you've experienced no such thing.  Bitcoin is in a massively expansive phase, the supply is inflating significantly. Bitcoin won't be deflating for a long time yet.

The printing can't realistically stop.  Our system is based on ever expanding debt but the amount of debt that can be absorbed by the system is limited.  When those limits are reached and rates are near zero (or even negative) there is nothing left to do but print.  But printing won't actually help economically because the problem isn't lack of liquidity, the problem is solvency--debt saturation.  So printing merely keeps banks from failing and causes various asset bubbles (e.g. the stock market currently) while undermining confidence and eventually leading to currency crisis/failure.
Those of us that know what is going on have been watching for this debt saturation point for years and we have a chart that shows about when the blow up would occur even before 2008.  That chart is of **The Marginal Productivity of Debt.**  It's a plot of change in GDP by change in debt.  Basically it shows how much GDP is gained by each dollar of new debt added.  This chart has been in decline for decades (adding more debt has been giving less boost to GDP over time) and once it goes negative adding more debt actually causes GDP to fall faster (and from there we enter various negative feedback loops that lead to deflationary collapse or hyperinflation depending what the government chooses to do).  The trendline on this chart has the point of debt saturation at about 2015. You can google "Marginal Productivity of Debt" and find some interesting articles.  Here's a few graphs for you from a quick search:

This is exactly backward. Strong economies with their strong currencies can afford armies to defend them. When economies/currencies weaken such that the paychecks of the guys with guns can't be paid, the men with guns leave and go where they will be paid. If armies could actually give value to money any number of economies and their currencies wouldn't have failed through history, including Rome.

Unless by financial asset you mean gold then no, financial assets are not like actual property.  A piece of paper representing some asset is not the same as the asset itself.  A menu is not a burger.  
If you give me a gold coin (or a burger) I have a gold coin (or a burger).  If you make some digital financial transaction I have some digital representation of some property that requires an astounding number of businesses and trust relationships to actually connect me to the property.  I don't have a burger, I have some numbers that supposedly mean I own a burger (presuming the trust system, businesses, government, etc. that are involved are all solid).

Of course price matters.  Bitcoin is scarce and price is used to balance that scarcity with demand.  As bitcoin becomes used more and particularly used more as a store of value it will rapidly become clear there is not much bitcoin out there and current prices are absurdly low.  There is not enough bitcoin for everyone in just southern California to own one bitcoin let alone everyone in the world.  The only way this gets reconciled is price goes up and most people won't ever have enough wealth to own a full bitcoin.

Bitcoin is actual property, though digital, like gold is actual physical property.  Beyond physical gold, existing financial assets are usually representations of assets of some sort.  If you don't understand the distinction between the asset and the representation of the asset you will continue to be confused.  A deed is not a house.  If the financial system that connects the deed to the house fails or somehow breaks down, you will rapidly discover exactly how much a deed is not a house (and that sort of thing actually happened during the 2008 crisis).

No, it was to keep from recognizing bitcoin as a valid currency and to make it difficult to use as a currency to discourage use.  IRS already has rules to collect taxes from gains made from foreign currency price gains.  Or do you mistakenly think all those currency traders out there don't pay taxes on their gains?  In fact they'd make more if it were recognized as a currency as tax rates on currency gains are higher than cap gain taxes. 
No they are making it as difficult as possible for people do things they don't like politically.  That includes pressuring banks recently to close accounts of porn stars, ammo dealers, payday money lenders, etc., and yes, sellers of bitcon.

It all relies on trust, not the blockchain.  Trust that the fund actually buys bitcoin as it claims, trust that the fund is even required to buy bitcoin as you think, trust that those bitcoin are actually held and not rehypothicated somewhere in such a way they are actually sold off or held as collateral while remaining a supposed asset of the fund, trust that the bitcoin are actually purchased free and clear and not purchased from another wall street entity that has rehypothicated them from someone else and so they are actually owned multiple times over, etc., etc.  All these sorts of shenanigans and worse have happened on wall street. All these things are easy to happen (and often legal) once you get away from the hard requirements the blockchain enforces. Once you're off blockchain you don't know what's really going on and that's why these guys set up off blockchain funds in the first place, so they can be  free of the strict requirements of the blockchain and get someone else to pay for the coins they control and even pay extra for the "service." And often those assets are used as collateral for other things (meaning multiple people can claim lawful ownership of the assets, something that cann't happen on the blockchain).
You use the gold ETF as an example and that's a perfect example, many people think that etf actually manipulates the price of gold, supressing it. All over the world there are many times more claims on gold then there is actual gold because of the bullshit wall street does. Germany has tried the last few years to physically get their gold back and after a few years gave up trying. Do you want the same thing to happen to bitcoin?  The blockchain tells you exactly how many bitcoins exist and what addresses they exist at, but what it can't tell you is how many times wall street bullshit has resold the same coins over and over again (often completely legally). So once wall street is involved and artificial off-blockchain coins exist via wall streets trust-based paper funds, how many bitcoins really exist?

*So, to be abundantly and perhaps pedantically clear, Nasdaq’s platform will trade shares by trading bitcoins.

In this case, Nasdaq is using Bitcoin’s blockchain, so they are using Bitcoin, not just “the technology behind Bitcoin.”*

Bitcoin's ace-in-the-hole is the continuing decline of the dollar. Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 financial crisis where unknown to most people the dollar system came within a stones throw of collapse. Since then nothing really has changed except they've printed trillions of dollars to try to reverse the crisis (and are still printing now, years later). Printing doesn't solve anything, rather it is behind nearly every currency/economic failure you've ever heard of (e.g. Weimar, Zimbabwe, Argentina) as well as dozens you haven't. 
Nothing has been solved since 2008, the problems have merely been hidden temporarily behind a screen of easy money and a rising stock market. When the issues come back (made even worse by printing rather than addressing them), bitcoin will be there as a working and honest alternative.

Not at all.  Fiat currencies (and their governments) come and go all the time. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is under 30 years.  The second largest super power in our age, the USSR, collapsed with its currency in the 90's and the world (and Russia) continued on.  You have an overblown idea of the importance of the US dollar.  The rest of the world is rapidly preparing for the end of the dollar's run as reserve currency ever since 2008 (well, even before then but with much more urgency now).  You should follow the news about world-wide gold repatriation, Russia and the east starting their own bank networks outside of SWIFT, physical gold and gold markets moving from London to asia, the fall of oil and the petro-dollar, etc., etc.  Every day there is more news showing the world preparing to leave the dollar.

When the internet was young there were actually businesses that popped up where you could send them snail mail and they would convert it to email and vice versa.  Those businesses did not last very long because obviously people simply moved away from snail mail to email.  I suspect it will be the same with with bitcoin.  For myself I sure as hell wouldn't want to be setting up a business in the remittance market--I think bitcoin is going to gut the entire market.

Debt does not independently "back" the dollar in the way gold used to. You are misusing the term. The dollar can fall in value and the value of the debt "behind" it will fall in value with it. All the hundreds of fiat currencies out there that have failed in the past did so despite the debt behind them (and often because of the debt behind them), and despite the earning power of their associated economies and power of their armies. So what sort of "backing" is that? It is no backing.  By contrast no gold backed currency has ever failed or could fail by definition as gold has never failed. That's what backing means.

No, bitcoin is finding its value.  It is volatile and will be for some time.
Silver isn't worth less in every other currency, it's gone up over time in every other fiat currency just as most commodities have.  Silver however is a monetary commodity like gold.  One of its primary purposes is to act as money and hold value over time.  If you don't think its significant that an hours worth of work in the 60's at minimum wage would get you an oz of silver while now it will only buy you a fraction of that, well that's your choice.  You can believe in the dollar if you want...  I'll just watch it inflate away to nothing.  It's already lost over 86% of its value in my lifetime alone.

YOU are completely ignorant of history and as a result keep saying things that are completely wrong.
Yes many currencies such as the US dollar have lasted over a century in name. However my claim was no FIAT currency has lasted more than a handfull of decades. The US dollar has only been a fiat currency since 1971 when the US government defaulted on its gold obligations.  Prior to that the dollar was backed by gold. The government defaulting on its gold obligations to the rest of the world forced the other global currencies into fiat as well. 
Yes gold fluxuates in value just like everything else. The Euro just lost 30% of its value in months. The Ruble just lost 50% of its value in weeks as did oil. Prices go crazy when the world is fiat and currencies are floating around with politics and over indebted nations.
The relevance and price of gold is not what you think it is. On the surface gold is publicly irrelevant and a miniscule amount of reserves. And yet the goverments of the world know very well it is the only part of reserves that is real and objective. The rest is all political paper that changes on the whim of a budget, dictator, election, etc. The gold just sits there waiting quietly to be relevant again, and governments know this full well despite what they publicly pretend. 
There is currently a lot of action happening with governments and gold globally since fiat has started to really shake apart in 2008. All over the world governments are repatriating their gold, pulling it out of other countries and shipping it back home. Superpower governments that are outside the western controlled money system, China and Russia, are buying gold by the hundreds of tons at accelerating rates. Why is this happening if gold is insignificant? Western Superpowers keep acting like gold is insignificant because the dollar is on top currently. But thing change. You apparently don't know it but money changes every few decades, often quite drastically and the world is setting up for another change where gold is being positioned to be a big player. If gold becomes a player again and takes on a global monetary role as it had just a few decades ago, it will once again take on a value relative to all the global fiat that was created since it was demonetized. Like bitcoin,the dollar and other monies the value of gold is arbitrary and matches the size and needs of the econmies it services (depending on its rarity). If gold comes back into play the global gold reserves suddenly won't be valued in billions, they will be vauled in the trillions. And it will have another effect that incentives this outcome... all the indebted countries out there will suddenly have very good debt ratios when gold is once again valued as a monetary asset because now all these countries will be sitting on large amounts of value of properly accounted for gold reserves, just as a few decades ago.
In short you dont have a clue what is really going on. You don't even know the recent history of your own money nor do you understand the politics of gold. Educate yourself, big changes are ahead.

Yes, gold is commodity money just as bitcoin is a digital commodity money.
Gold is largely useless (and that is not a bad thing), it's small industrial use does not account for the vast bulk of its price.  This is not an accident, this is an important feature of a monetary commodity and why gold holds the position that it does.  A good monetary commodity should be largely useless to industry as otherwise (1) it would be used up, and (2) the supply/demand dynamics of  industry would then interfere with pricing in the monetary realm and (3) monetary hoarding of the commodity (think gold in vaults) would morally and economically infringe on industry causing shortages of a needed commodity.  Hoarding gold does not infringe on anyone because it is mostly useless.  This is why gold is chosen by the market over more industrial commodities like silver and platinum to be the primary monetary commodity.
Bitcoin is like gold, it's largely useless beyond its primary use as a monetary commodity.  TL;DR: It's not a bad thing that bitcoin is mostly useless except as money, it's actually a critically important property of the technology.

Actually China is no longer buying US bonds, they are buying gold by the hundreds of tons.  You are out of the loop--you'd better start paying attention. But yes countries generally buy lots of foreign currencies as part of their currency management.  That doesn't mean gold isn't important.
By the way I'm not a gold bug.  I'm just a money guy.  I even held your views on gold at one time before I researched the issue.  I know about gold because it is critically important to understanding money (and bitcoin).  Frankly if you don't understand gold, the global money of the last 5000 years, you don't understand money.
You seem to like arguments from authority, so instead of taking my word for it you can take the former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's word for it.  A couple months ago at the The Council on Foreign Relations he said "Gold is a currency. It is still by all evidences the premier currency where no fiat currency, including the dollar, can match it."

At an earlier Councils on Foreign Relations Greenspan's advice to central bankers was to watch gold.  He said "Fiat money has no place to go but gold,” and “If all currencies are moving up or down together, the question is: relative to what? Gold is the canary in the coal mine. It signals problems with respect to currency markets. Central banks should pay attention to it.”
Of course if you go back to the 60's when gold was still tied to money you can find Greenspan's full view on gold in his essay "Gold and Economic Freedom".  In it he explains why people like you hate gold as well as why gold is the protector of property rights and stands in the way of government wealth confiscation.
I highly recommend you look into this subject.  You don't have to be a "gold bug" to understand the premier currency (the Fed Chairman's words, not mine) of the entire planet. Or maybe the Fed Chairman is an uneducated "gold bug" idiot, hmm?

Downtrend will be broken around the time we're looking at a halving of the block reward... combination of bullish factors will then take bitcoin higher rapidly. At that point the sub will be full of whiners who can't get their money in bitcoin fast enough or who had the price move against them before they could buy, yada yada. They will bitch about the "lucky early adopters" who already have bitcoin and are now getting rich for "doing nothing." And I will tell them, fuck you and your whining, the price was low for months and you did jack-shit then.

Every fiat currency has had someone in the role of central bank even if it wasn't called that.  Issuance and other management are a necessary part of running a fiat currency.  You'd do better to argue that our understanding of how to run a fiat system has advanced and such a feat can now be accomplished.  Of course all one has to do is actually look around at the dozens of fiat failures in the last hundred years or the number and severity of ongoing fiat crises around the world right now to know that isn't true either.  We're witnessing the failure of fiat on a global level right now and bitcoin is a reflection of that (having been born out of the crisis).  Again you're free to have another opinion but I suggest you just keep watching world events as things continue to unfold (Japan will probably be the first domino to fall).  In the meantime my position that the dollar might not be around in 20 years has ample historical support, and that was my original point.
I agree the dollar has been around longer than bitcoin.  Again your only argument against bitcoin seems to be how young bitcoin is.  And again I agree with you that it's young and risky even for reasons beyond what you state.  And yet I still give it better odds than the dollar in being here 20 years from now.

I agree, the whole thing is an experiment that is way ahead of the current state of bitcoin. It makes no sense to try to secure trillions worth of securities on a blockchain worth 3 billion. They don't want to say it, and maybe they don't even know it yet but bitcoin the currency has to grow significantly in adoption, size, price, etc before any of this will make sense.
These newly interested companies need to be investing in core development to help take bitcoin where it is headed. They can't just say "blockchain" while ignoring bitcoin and think it means anything. The future is clear but we actually have to get there. And it requires bitcoin to be orders of magnitude larger and more valuable before it can hold and manage all the value they are talking about.

The miners verify the integrity of the global ledger and operationally confirm transactions. They don't know those involved in transactions and are not giving knowledgeable permission for the transactions like banks do. You are not being personally babysat, the system is being operationally maintained, that's a big difference. 
Bitcoin is money.  Consider in the future where there would be no steps to exchange for fiat, except perhaps to get fiat to pay taxes once a year.

WTF are you talking about?  Wow you are clueless.  Gold is HUGE in China both at the government level and at the citizen level.  China is the largest consumer of gold in the world.
Global commerce is not generally done in gold currently.  This is merely a reflection of the current state of gold having been demonetized.  The current state of gold is not likely to be permanent. The fiat system is coming apart and an update to the global monetary system is due.  I don't care if you believe me on this, if you knew what to look for you could see it happening.  As it is you'll see it happen when it happens.
Yes, the current value of gold is very low.  It hasn't had its value adjusted to match the massive expansion of currency since the 70's.  When gold becomes monetized again there will have to be a massive revaluation and it will be quite a surprise to people like you.
The real issue isn't really gold, it's fiat.  It's not that gold is so great, it's that fiat is so bad. Fiat is a political creation and governments, their policies, and their currencies tend to come and go.  That's the real reason no fiat has ever lasted more than a handful of decades.  Any fiat currency could literally vanish tomorrow or be significantly devalued (this has recently been happening to the Euro and Ruble--major currencies).  What good is a pile of foreign reserves that are just political paper constructs with no guaranteed or lasting value?  The only reserve that actually means anything objective or long term is the gold position of a country.  It's even irrelevant what the price of gold is, politically it's the amount held that matters not the price.  The US has the most gold, they are (at the moment anyway) on top and make the rules.  China and Russia are making plays to increase their gold positions, not because gold is a great investment but because it gives them political clout especially in any future global monetary decisions.  It also means that they are tired of the dollar and they signal that by moving into gold.  You seem to have some sort of irrational hatred of gold so will simply reject these simple facts, but if you step back, relax, and actually do some research on gold you will quickly discover it is an incredibly important political tool.

Rome had the biggest army and it still collapsed.  In fact what happened in the case of Rome is when things started falling apart the army was very quickly turned against the people and used to take the wealth of the rich citizens to keep the government going long after things should have collapsed. The government would pay the army/police well as that was their protection and source of income, give the broke masses bread and circuses to keep them fed and distracted so they wouldn't rise up, while taking everything else away from anyone else until there was nothing left to take.

You are confused because you live in an odd time in history where for a short period of time money has been captured by governments and made fiat.  This won't last long... perhaps another couple decades at the rate things are going.  As for gold, it's not an "investment" nor an inflation hedge--it is wealth.  In a world full of paper wealth promises and transitory investment fads, gold sits quietly as simple wealth, just as valuable as it has been for thousands of years.  Long after the dollar has joined every other fiat in history in the grave of dead monies, gold will still be the wealth of the rich and powerful.
You can claim it isn't money but the various countries and central banks around the world holding thousands of tons of gold reserves don't care what you think.  The sort of accounting gold is used for is currently not at the consumer level, but that doesn't mean it's not a unit of account.  It's a more crucial unit of account at the level of sovereigns than any single fiat.

No, gold is very different from other commodites, it is not consumed.  All the gold that has ever been mined still exists, most of it held as wealth reserves in a vault somewhere or as a wealth reserve for individuals in the form of jewelry. All the gold mined in a year across the globe is a tiny fraction of all that stored wealth. If gold were to rapidly rise to $100,000 an oz, the countries with the large gold reserves would have the wealth just as they do now. (However an interesting thing happens that is a big hint to where the incentives are for gold remonetization, these countries would suddenly no longer have debt problems as their real assets would suddenly be a much larger portion compared to their debts!).  Gold poor countries could mine but they could only mine a tiny fraction and would never catch up, especially when the wealthy countries can mine too.
Here is a link to a Wikipedia article that shows the gold holdings of various countries. These are the countries positioned to gain the most from a gold remonetization (And China is likely much higer on the list than these official numbers show):
All the debt problems out there being suffered by countries, even total basket cases like Japan and Greece can be solved overnight by remonetizing gold again and raising its value to be consistent with the modern size of economies and debts. The solution is staring everyone in the face but no country says anything because they want to keep accumulating gold quietly for as long as possible while it's still cheap before the revaluation. The US says nothing as they would rather the dollar stays the reserve currency of the world  (but that is already changing rapidly ).

Jesus dude.  Gold is not valued today anywhere near where it was in previous years since it has been demonitized.  It is not possible to spend 4 trillion buying gold because there's not 4 trillion worth of gold in the entire world available to buy!  You have to think like a giant.  How can you buy 1000 tons of gold when there isn't 1000 tons of gold to be bought?  China's government already takes every oz of gold that is mined from its gold mines into its reserves.  If it didn't care about gold would it be doing that?
China holds a superpower's worth of gold and is increasing its share.  How much that is in dollars isn't relevant because gold is not properly valued in dollar term.  The US actually values gold at $42/oz, the same value it had when it defaulted on its gold obligations in the 1971!  Do you think that's what we really think gold is worth?  Or is the value unimportant and it's the number of oz that matter?
Land is not a workable store of wealth because you can't exchange it.  Any country can simply take their land back by government action.  Only gold is portable wealth with a long history of filling that need.

You shouldn't be trying to explain things you haven't a clue about.  The US, through monetary mismanagement of its gold obligations, DEFAULTED on those global obligations.  We didn't "outgrow gold" we basically stole gold from the entire world and forced everyone else into the fiat system we now have.
Saying the economic value of the US (or the world) becomes to large for gold is nonsensical.  Gold is a monetary commodity not an industrial one--like with bitcoin its value is arbitrary and adjusts to fit the economy it services.  The US didn't want to adjust the dollar price of gold in the 70's (like it already did before in the 30's), so it DEFAULTED.

Maybe you should stop talking and start listening considering you don't have a clue what you're talking about.  It's not the percentage of gold reserves that matter, it's the size of the reserves in relation to the size of other countries reserves.  There isn't that much gold in the world in relation to the amount of paper "wealth" that has been created the last few decades.  Who has the most gold, who has 2nd most, etc. that is what is important.  Foreign reserves are NOTHING, they are paper that can and will be a totally different value next week (or totally worthless).  What matters is the amount of gold held, not the price of that gold nor the percentage of reserves.  China has drastically increased its gold holdings and and moved itself up the list of who holds the most gold (and likely has significantly more gold than is currently reported).  Yes it's a small amount in relation to their reserves, but so what?  It's not a small amount in relation to all other gold holders in the world--they are rapidly approaching superpower status in relation to other gold holders of the world.
Note that if gold becomes remonetized again as many people expect it will, there will be a significant gold revaluation and your whole point will be gone as a thousands tons of gold could suddenly be worth trillions.
The wealth of a country does not back its fiat.  If a fiat fails the fiat holders don't get to go take a share of the wealth of the fiat's issuing country.  Fiat is a political construct, it can be devalued on a whim with no relation to the economy (the US has devalued its currency several times).  A government can be replaced and its fiat become worthless overnight despite the wealth of the country not changing (this happens all the time).  In all these cases holders of fiat have no recourse to any "wealth backing", they are simply out of luck.  The value of fiat has a relationship with the economics of its country, but it's not in any way backed by the wealth of the country by any meaningful definition of "backed."
I appreciate your view that gold is unimportant.  That is the view the western world wants people to believe even while their actions say the opposite.  I can only point you in the direction of the facts, you actually have to go study and discover the reality for yourself.
I'll simply repeat again, what is a wealth store in a world where fiat comes and goes?  Who has wealth and what is wealth?  Is having a pile of rubles wealth when the value of that pile got cut in half in a matter of weeks?  Is it having a pile of dollars when dollars are digitally created by the trillion every year?  There is one premier currency, it isn't "managed" by any government and it hasn't changed for 5000 years.  The most powerful countries in the world hold massive amounts of it (relative to how much gold exists and how much gold is held by other countries).  Is that just for kicks?  Or is there a reason behind it?  Maybe so... and maybe you can you simply go read those reasons explained for you by a previous Fed Chairman if you weren't so irrational about the whole subject.

Do you know what it even means to "target" a low inflation rate? The natural condition of a healthy economy is a few percent deflation from productivity increases. To turn that into a few percent inflation means those in control of the money steal that few percent of created value plus another few pecent of value to turn the rate so it decreases. That's somewhere like 6% of national wealth taken right out of the hands of those holding money... and where does the 6% or so of wealth go every year? Basically away from the people and to the banks and rich. And they convince you that they do it for your own good. Look at the biggest and most fancy buildings in your town...  odds are a large number of them are banks. And they get all that wealth manufacturing what? Nothing.

I don't think anyone is going to peg a currency to gold or start another gold standard so those issues aren't really relevant.  There is no need to directly tie gold to a currency or economy, gold can function just fine in parallel to local currencies as an objective, tangible store of wealth that can be traded between entities.  Basically it won't look much different than what happens today.  The main difference I'm predicting is the value of gold will have to go up significantly to make it a relevant global monetary asset and fulfill a role that is currently missing in the current fiat system.  
Right now gold is not really used as an active monetary asset and as a result has a price so low it's hardly relevant.  The US has the largest gold reserves and yet the reserve total value is less than $300 billion which is nothing to a country that has a debt of over $17 trillion and a GNP of about the same.  That's insignificant pocket change.  For gold to be a relevant reserve asset (priced in relation to global wealth like it used to be) it must revalue upwards significantly.  It can then be a meaningful way to exchange wealth between nations for whatever reasons might be required.  Right now with fiat there really is no meaningful way to exchange actual wealth between countries as each country controls its own fiat (so has a similar problem explained in my previous comment when country B can always manipulate their own currency to their own benefit and to the detriment of country A).  Gold is objective, can't be "printed," and has thousands of years of history of being used as money and to settle debts.  It is likely to come back into play again, and probably relatively soon.
And as I've already mentioned reintroducing gold into the monetary system (which will result in raised gold values) has the added benefit of bailing the gold holding countries out of their rapidly worsening debt problems.  In fact I think the upper limit on the wait time for gold remonetization is related to how much longer and deeper the larger countries can go in their debt problems before they become intractable and must turn to gold revaluation.

Dogecoin being uncapped is a non-event in my opinion.  What does it matter if a small fixed number of coins continue to trickle on forever?  As long as it's not a growing number the number of added coins approaches zero in relation to the total number of coins over time.  If anything it negates the whole deflation argument without actually being actually being much different than a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:59:08
I'm not saying a healthy economy requires deflation, I'm saying the currency in a healthy economy naturally deflates (goes up in value) due to productivity increases. Thus is not an opinion, this is fact. To get the currency to inflate (go down in value) they steal the value of the  productivity increases plus another couple percent right off the top. That's what it means to "target" a low inflation rate. When you wonder why most people you know are broke and can't get ahead the declining value of their money is a big reason why. Tell us all again how this is for our own good.

Clue for you, the subject is gold, not the USD so your point on the USD being divisible is not applicable.  As for your point about altcoins, gold has "altcoins" of its own...  silver, platinum, palladium, etc. to say nothing of SDRs.  As for theft, how many thefts of gold have there been through history?  Bottom line is bitcoin can be secured more securely than gold and for a lot less money, that some exchanges haven't done that isn't bitcoin's fault.
Bitcoin beats gold in nearly every way but one.  Bitcoin cannot beat gold's 5000+ year uninterrupted history of being a solid store of wealth.  If you want a sure thing, gold is a sure thing.  Bitcoin is still a speculation.

Even fiat doesn't solve what he's concerned with. Fiat is volatile too, especially these days. It just seems reasonably stable because everything is priced in fiat.
Ironically bitcoin can be very stable but it requires a  change in thinking about what is coming as bitcoin matures. Consider that the whole time the dollar price of bitcoin has been so volatile, the actual number of bitcoin anyone holds hasn't changed. If I hold 5 bitcoin I still have 5 bitcoin tomorrow despite any volatility in the fiat pricing world. What I'm saying is the current bitcoin volatility is a reflection of pricing in dollars. As bitcoin matures, becomes used globally,  and more importantly becomes the source of pricing rather than dozens of fiats suddenly it won't be bitcoin that is volatile. A bitcoin is a bitcoin and how many will exist is known--this is practically the definition of stability and is a huge contrast to fiat where billions are created in QE programs in various  countries and value is always being managed down. Bitcoin has the capability of being extremely stable compared to fiat, but it needs to grow more and take on it's own pricing. What I think is coming eventually is fiat will be priced against bitcoin, not the other way around and bitcoin will become stable as a rock by comparison.

The real problem is incomes have not been keeping up with loss of purchasing power. In the 60's a guy pumping gas could support a family. Today it takes both parents working plus a bunch of money pulled from the future via credit card debt.
Here's a fun fact, the minimum wage in the early 60's was $1.25, but  $1.25 in quarters from the early 60's today is worth nearly $16 as quarters were silver back then (and that's with a low silver value, silver has fallen significantly along with many commodites lately... a few years ago the value was double that).
It's great that you have a surplus and can save money and get ahead against inflation. You might be one of the rich whose wealth has increased in the last several decades. But for the majority of American households their wealth has fallen significantly.

The limits of money printing are related to overall debt to GNP and budget deficit. There comes a tipping  point where it costs so much to run a government vs how much money is coming in via taxes coupled with a huge amount of debt already incurred needing to be serviced where the smart money begins to leave the building. Bonds holders sell, velocity of money increases, and the government still has a lot of costs to keep itself running and must sell even more bonds... this feeds on itself and spirals out of control.
People like to talk about debt levels as being the cause but the key is high budget deficit / cost of government coupled with high debt. Once a certain threshhold is crossed there is no solution, the math guarantees it--the money or government will collapse and sometimes both.

Bitcoin is in a distribution phase as at first nobody has any bitcoin (duh!).  So yes it's currently being inflated otherwise mining wouldn't work, nobody would have any to use, etc.   However this is a pre-programmed coin distribution known and understood by all that use bitcoin.  It is not remotely compatible to the out-of-control money printing being done in the US in the hands of a few.
Bitcoin distribution started high and tapers off in a planned and fixed curve.  Dollar printing has recently gone completely haywire compared to past history and is rocketing higher since 2008 in an out of control disaster-waiting-to-happen.  Here's a chart from the Fed itself:

Wow, you know a lot of money myths. What a mess.  First off gold is not backed by the work it takes to mine it just as bitcoin is not backed by the electricity it takes to mine it. You can put effort into digging totally useless material out of the ground and it doesn't give that material value. Here's more on that.
Dollars are not backed by sweat nor guns. Neither dollars nor gold get value from past work "stored" in them as explained before, that's a discredited labor theory of value. What Rand means, and what really gives dollars value, is taxes that you are required to pay (under threat of a gun) give money value and also require work to get. But it's not the work or the guns that give money value, it's taxes you are required to pay in that specific money that can give an otherwise worthless piece of paper value. The taxes cause an artificial demand for dollars which gives them value--we all have to put in effort to have dollars to pay the tax man when he comes around so we don't go to jail.
As for bitcoin it has intrinsic value just as gold does. Both have intrinsic properties that make them good money (good for storage and exchange of value). Gold's properties are physical and bitcoin's are digital, but they are similar. The properties of bitcoin/gold make them useful for storage and exchange of value and that's what makes both useful and thus valuable. Here's a list of some of the properties if you care:

It was as true then too. Just because the system has somewhat held together for 5 years doesn't mean there isn't a problem. Objectively there is a serious problem... US debt is at levels seen in dozens of historical currency failures and our deficits are nearing similar dangerous levels. Base money is being actively created by the trillion the last few years exactly like done in countries with currency failures and unlike anything in the dollar's history. If these trends continue, and so far there is no political will to stop them (instead they just get worse), the dollar will fail just as all the historical currencies in similar situations have failed.

@_date: 2015-01-04 14:44:42
There is a cost to mining (electricity, etc.). If bitcoin price falls too low compared to how fast you find a block those costs exceed the value of any mined coins. The solution in that case is to turn off the miners until price goes back up so you don't lose money. Cloud mining is no different. So it sounds to me this isn't a scam, it's the economics of mining hitting your payouts. You don't get to simply make no bitcoin when price falls too low, it starts costing you money to keep mining just like with every other miner out there. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:49:08
WTF are you talking about?  I'm not suggesting anyone go back to a gold standard.  A gold standard doesn't work.  Trying to set an amount of gold for an amount of currency is price fixing and like most price fixing doesn't work because things tend to change and fixings break down (which is why the US ended up defaulting twice in the first place).  However gold (or bitcoin) could be a monetary commodity that debts are settled in and that currencies float against.  Right now there is no basis to the fiat monetary at all...  there is no final settlement of debts between nations (let alone between people).  Everyone just swaps these silly papers around that are ever expanding at insane rates matching the horrendous financial mismanagement of most the countries in the world now.  Fiat is ruinous.
Seriously, if you believe all this why are you in a bitcoin forum?  Bitcoin has the same issue.  There will be only 21 million bitcoins.  Is that too small for the global economy?  Or is bitcoin's price, like gold, arbitrary and will expand to fit the market?

On the contrary, accumulating property is how I've made everything I have and more importantly, kept it.  Trading is a game, and a difficult game at that.  Fiat money is even worse.  Stocks are transient.  Most people have no concept of wealth.  Wealth is lasting property that you own and keep long term and even over generations.  There are not a lot of assets that I consider actual long term, generational wealth but gold is a primary one.  You want to accumulate at a low price, but as you're keeping it long term (forever?) the short term price fluctuations don't really matter.

On your very first point you are clueless. Checks and bank transfers are not person to person. They are intermediated by banks. You are getting bank permission to exchange value, and it can be stopped or reversed at any time. Even cash is not person to person in that there is another party that manages (or mismangages) the value of the  cash itself. Bitcoin is actual property exchange  between two people, something that doesn't really exist in the fiat world.

I'm going to presume for a moment that you're not just playing dumb to troll and you honestly don't know you are spouting utter nonsense.  Let me explain why it's not possible for a country to buy another country or even buy too much of another countries assets.  This is because purchasing and holding ownership depends on property rights, rule of law, etc. and such things are region specific and can be modified by regional governments.  So for example if country A goes and buys a bunch of gold mines or oil wells (or whatever) in country B, country B at its whim could simply declare the purchases null and void or nationalize the assets back to control of country B.  Country B can do this because they make the laws in country B and additionally have an obligation to protect their citizens and national assets from outside threats.  That's why it takes an actual war/invasion for one country to take the assets or land from another country, you can't just do it with a legal contract like a purchase.

The article doesn't strip out debt, rather it accounts for it.  He's correcting for the effectiveness of our debt utilization.  When something like that is not done, as it's not done for government GDP numbers, injecting high amounts of badly utilized debt can obviously make things look much better than they are.  Intuitively you must realize if we've crammed a ton of new money into the system and don't somehow account for it then all our economic numbers will be wrong, and that's exactly the point the article is making.
These concepts are not that difficult and economists do talk about them (but not any mainstream ones that want to keep their jobs).  Again I recommend googling "marginal productivity of debt" as that's the term economists use for the sort of "correction" the article is trying to account for.  The marginal productivity of debt in the US has been falling for a long time.  We add more and more debt and get less and less of a GDP boost from it as time goes on.  Eventually it ends badly.
As for December jobs, they were up as you point out while wages were down (meaning the quality of jobs continue to decline).  Economically it doesn't say much to me...  we're still a long way away from the number of jobs required just to get us back to pre-2008 levels and I don't see any change in the big picture.  We're been bumping along in a very weak "recovery" (the weakest on record) and now we're overdue for a correction and the next one is likely to be very ugly.  Any little bump up in jobs now will be shed again quite rapidly at the next downturn.

The vast majority of money creation (what we call "printing" but is now done digitally) is done by the banking system via debt creation!  Fiat money is debt, debt creation is money creation. If you give your bitcoin to banks and give up the importance of private key management you are opening bitcoin printing to them via fractional reserve. That is what banks do. 
As for your other point what you don't seem to understand is the fundamental difference between bitcoin and fiat. Bitcoin is bitcoin, it is an asset not a debt. You can tell the difference trivially between a bitcoin and a bitcoin debt (one is on the blockchain and one isn't). Fiat is debt. There is no way to distinguish between a dollar and a dollar debt, they are the same thing. Because money is now debt and it's what everyone is used to  few people even understand this point as your comment shows. With fiat banks create more debt money and it goes right into circulation (it is money creation) and there is no way to know what is an asset and what is a debt because it's all debt (and it constantly expands). With bitcoin banks can't do that. You either have a bitcoin or you have a bitcoin debt. The two are not the same. One is on the blockchain the other is in some centralized bank database.

I moved my comment to below, but to answer your question...  merchants should discount bitcoin because they get their money quicker, no fees, no fraud or chargebacks, etc.  That is worth a discount.  If they don't agree, fuck 'em, they can have my credit card then and I'll get reward points.

I appreciate your point that the implied premise of the article doesn't even really apply--in the current system you don't pay off the debt, you manage it.  But that system of ever expanding debt is a problem in itself and is never even allowed to come into question by the mainstream, it's just presumed a "modern" economic structure and you don't discuss its downsides (of which there are plenty).  
I agree the US debt is a highly desirable place to invest compared to the rest of the world.  However that isn't really saying much as the rest of the world is not doing well either.
As for showing the recovery since 2008 and current growth is fake, all you have to do is look beyond the headline bullsh*t.  I've made this argument on reddit several times, here's one of them where I'm showing a guy there has been no recovery since 2008:
And to save me further typing, here's similar points being made with government data for you to browse including a few points I don't mention (e.g. housing data, inactivity rate of men in their prime, etc.).  Looking at the secular decline of this data or the lack of recovery in the data since 2008 is striking to anyone trying to argue things are great:
You don't have to take my word on any of this.  Since both of the above links were written oil has gone into free fall (because of lack of demand from all that "economic growth") and is leading a renewed dive into severe deflation that you'll get to watch smash across the US and the world in real time.

On the contrary, gold performs extremely well over generations.  Gold held a thousand years ago is still the same wealth today--try doing that with an S&amp;P 500 ETF.   
This is not the sort of thinking ordinary people deal with so it's sort of an odd discussion.  Most people don't worry about how to accumulate property/wealth and transfer it through time.  That's the sort of discussion only certain types of rich people have.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:29:43
To remonetize gold. Right now gold is the defacto underlying basis of the financial system in that it is held as a reserve asset globally by central banks, however it is not actually monetized and its price does not reflect the global wealth that has accumulated since it was demonetized. It cannot actually be used to extinguish debt because it's market cap is too low... debts have exploded with nothing physical in the world expanding to match that value. What good is a monetary system whose value has become so out of whack with the real world that it's not possible to even map all that debt-value to anything real? What good is a having a "bazillion" dollars in the system when that is many times more than the size of the entire global economy? It's more that all the real "stuff" on earth... so what does it even mean? And what if the current system changes, as it has so many times in the past, and once again there is a desire to "map" or represent some of the paper wealth out there into something real that is not some centralized paper fantasy controlled by a government? What can change value to contain that wealth without putting undo stress on industry and ordinary people from becoming 100x more expensive literally overnight? Gold has traditionally acted in that capacity... it does not impact the majority of the world if it goes to $100 or $100000. It is money, it's job is to represent value and hold it in a way that does not impact industry and people (something bitcoin tries to do too btw, but that's another story).
Changes are coming. Superpowers China and Russia are buying gold heavily; European countries are repatriating their gold (or trying to anyway). Gold has been in backwardation more in the last year than all other periods of backwardation in recorded history combined. Gold has been out of play since the US default in 1971 but looks like it will come back into play in a big way within a decade or two.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:34:36
Yes, something around here is retarded, that's for sure.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:54:42
Gold did become a money (which includes store of value) partly because it has relatively less industrial use.  That lack of industrial use reduces its volatility (because it's not impacted by industry) and makes it so that over time it is more likely to evolve to be used as money.  That's not the only reason, it's one of many.  
Generally I don't care if you believe me or not.  I didn't make this stuff up, this is the sort of stuff you find if you study the subject for a decade or two.  The study of gold is not something many people do anymore, so most people are unaware of these things.

Wow, you are confused.  I know you probably aren't old enough to remember anything but fiat by try to imagine a world where gold was money, not fiat.  
Gold's value, just like everything else, is arbitrary and set by the market.  The US couldn't even set gold's value (the market did that), it could only set a number of dollars as a certain amount of gold.  Gold was money, not dollars, and dollars were priced by gold not the other way around.  The world was using gold and the US should have adjusted its currency to match its finances and the global market reality, not sacrifice the entire global monetary system (and steal everyone's gold in the process) for its own financial mismanagement.
The system we have now is the result of a massive default, a dishonorable world-wide theft.  The fiat system is not "money evolved", it was a supposedly "temporary" emergency action (that later became permanent) and was the result of monetary mismanagement of the major superpower.

@_date: 2015-01-07 07:09:06
You don't know that.  In fact it would be a lot easier for the thief to never switch to dollars...  trying to get that sort of money into dollars would be very difficult.  That's exactly how you get caught, so my guess is the thief is specifically NOT looking to convert into dollars.  Besides, you don't need to convert bitcoin into dollars to buy stuff...  and using bitcoin without converting to dollars gets easier every day.

With futures you buy and sell "contracts" with other futures traders and never need to settle in the actual underlying.  It works sort of like a bet on price between the buyer and seller of a contract...  as the bitcoin price moves one way or the other cash moves from buyer to seller brokerage account and vice versa.  The contracts have leverage, meaning you might only have to hold $10,000 to buy contracts worth $200,000 of bitcoin (or whatever the margin levels they require).
Price of the underlying can be effected by the futures market.  If a lot of contracts are bought or sold it boils down to a lot of leverage on the bitcoin price.  That can cause bitcoin price to move due to arbitration and hedging against the futures market price of bitcoin.  If you want to move the bitcoin price with the least amount of money, the futures market would be the place to go.
TL;DR:  Futures allow hugely leveraged bets on bitcoin price to be made without actually buying/selling bitcoin and this "paper bitcoin" activity will effect the price of real bitcoins.

There's nothing in your reply that disputes the facts the article makes.  You merely argue everything appears to be fine (so far) for a bunch of reasons that actually don't mean very much.  So what if borrowing costs are low--people aren't borrowing because they are broke.  So what if Japan has so far managed to hold together at their astronomical debt levels, it doesn't mean they will continue to do so or that the levels of debt they (and the US) are in are OK.  There has been a lot less actual economic growth the last few years and a lot more manipulation of headline numbers to make it seem like there is growth, but that's a long discussion.  Let's just say the happy talk from people like you don't change the stark realities we face even if you are unaware what they are.

Lol, not for the sake of ideology, for the sake of solvency. Countries are broke. The US is over 100% debt to GDP, Japan is something like triple that and teetering on a monetary collapse at any time. Russia is in outright hyperinflation (again) now.  The fiat system and its related debts has impoverished them while all the gold assets have never been revalued since before the early 70's gold default by the US. A revaluation makes everyone solvent again.
I'm just pointing out the obvious, it's the superpowers  like China and Russia that are rapidly accumulating gold the last few years. Ask yourself why are they doing that? For "ideology?"

Ive said this before many times but here it is again...   
I trade wall street markets every day but I do not trade bitcoin, I hodl with control of my own private keys.  Over the lifetime of bitcoin most exchanges have failed, often taking customer coin with them. As a result the systemic risk of holding bitcoin in an exchange is too high to make trading bitcoin profitable when you take that risk into consideration. This is a big reason I don't trade bitcoin or keep any coin in an exchange. Hopefully this changes in the years ahead but so far problems on exchanges are an ongoing thing.

I'm talking about a time frame taking months, you're talking about something that happens in days or immediately.  It doesn't happen immediately, it takes time for the market to be moved.  Of course exactly when the market moves due to the halving can't be predicted.  The market might anticipate the halving and move before it happens, or it might happen after.  But still we're talking about a relatively short period of time--a window of months around the halving.

I'm not cherry picking anything.  I'm pointing to standard government data series and noticing their charts are declining or flat since 2008.  I don't see recovery, I don't see growth.  Someone is cherry picking the data and making misleading headlines, but it's not me.  I agree with you some of the data series have been problems going back a long while, I don't think that invalidates my point.
In the end the judge is reality over opinion.  We only have to watch the world and see what happens.  Since my linked post above was written oil has gone into free fall (from lack of demand from all that "economic growth") and is collapsing several entire economies around the world, driving entire business sectors into bankruptcy, and otherwise ushering in a renewed decline into severe deflation.  I think all you need to do is open your eyes and watch to see what happens the next year or so to know which of us is closer to the truth.

I don't know about the rapture but a dollar failure is likely to happen based on the history of fiat.  The fiat dollar is already well past the typical lifespan of most fiats and heading toward the zone of "no fiat has ever lasted this long in a thousand years of fiat history."  A pretty solid historical marker for the end approaching is when the currency goes into non-stop printing mode, which the dollar went into with the 2008 crisis.

I know nothing of oil and oil has little to do with the monetary discussion we've been having.  Oil is an industrial commodity, it is consumed; it is not a monetary animal.

I think bitcoin is getting caught in some of this other commodity crash, but yeah let's talk about bitstamp...  that's what's going on, right?  Not a panic in the world's energy supply and core industrial metal, but some tiny bitcoin exchange from some country nobody has heard of... it's not chinese traders being forced out of billions in positions (including bitcoin) as commodites and their stock exchange fall, it's a few million in bitstamp.

I just explained to you how the purchasing power of $1.50 back then is equivalent to $30 in 2012 by the measure of one simple constant (that was actually used as money back then)--silver.  You can use the government CPI numbers to discover minimum wage was higher back then also but it won't be as extreme as my measure since the CPI is "managed" to make inflation less severe than it really is as there are big incentives for the government to "manage" it that way (e.g. social security payments are tied to inflation so will be easier to pay if CPI is reported lower than it really is).

Your first few points are based on misreading my comment.  I wrote the vast majority of fiat creation is done by banks, not by government "printing".  I wasn't talking about how much fiat was debt. Fiat is debt based--it's debt.
As for your other point, if a bitcoin is lent to someone there is still just one bitcoin.  The other party has some sort of note that represents a bitcoin debt and that is obviously not a bitcoin as it isn't on the blockchain and cannot be spent like a bitcoin nor can it be loaned out again.  In the fiat banking system people deposit dollars and those dollars are lent out while the original depositors still think they have their dollars.  There is no distinction between the original deposited dollar and and lent out dollar, they are all debt.  After the loan there are now two dollars where before there was only one--you have one and the guy your dollar was lent to has one.  And the newly created one can be deposited and loaned out again!  [That's not quite accurate as there are issues with reserve ratios, etc. but that gives a basic idea of where more fiat money comes from].  And in reality banks don't even need to have the deposits to loan out first, they just create money to loan out at the time of the loan and find enough "deposits" of some sort later to fulfill their reserve requirements (and those requirements have been dropping over the years).

My view is those focusing on dollars and not bitcoin are missing the point.  If someone is only interested in dollars and doesn't know why they want or need bitcoin that person isn't ready for bitcoin.  When bitcoin is ready its advantages will be apparent, you won't have to disguise it as dollars (and implicitly tie it to all the disadvantages of dollars).

You couldn't be more incorrecr. The bulk of the problems above all have to do with bitcoin being new and volatile. Any replacement coin would have the same problems only worse as it would be smaller that bitcoin with less recognition and support. Besides if bitcoin failed it would cast a huge shadow over the whole concept of crypto that would damage any competitive coin. No, either bitcoin works or no crypto will.

I'm happy to spend my bitcoin with merchants as are most people I presume.  However merchants can only get my bitcoin if they offer *significant* discounts for bitcoin vs credit card price.  Otherwise I'll hold my bitcoin and use my credit card and get reward points--the merchant can deal with with the card fees, fraud, chargebacks, payment delays, etc.  
So far most merchants are asleep at the wheel and not discounting bitcoin--so fuck 'em, they don't  get my bitcoin.

Existing systems don't work well for a lot of types of value exchanges and bitcoin works better in those cases, e.g. person to person (I don't have a credit card processor), across borders, purchases of  expensive products where fraud and chargebacks are a huge risk like cars, houses, gold, etc. (try selling a car with fiat sometime, the risks are huge compared to bitcoin),  micropayments, then of course there are gray area products like porn and gambling. 
Bitcoin has its place, it's just not as a consumer payment method on amazon yet as credit cards work better for the moment. However when the availability and discounts for paying with bitcoin become more widespread, then bitcoin will be the best option period. I think that is coming in the next couple years.

Personally I don't find the every day consumer use of bitcoin to be its selling point (except in the case when merchants significantly discount bitcoin).  Why would I stop using a credit card for every day purchases when it has consumer protections, perks, charge-back ability, gives me a free one month loan, and puts all the fees on the merchant?  Bitcon is not better than credit cards for consumer purchases unless a merchant gives me a big discount to make up for what I lose (or for those that are unbanked and have no access to credit cards).  Bottom line, consumer purchasing is not why bitcoin is groundbreaking IMO.
Bitcoin is useful for its ability to give direct control of assets and keep them away from those that would control, debase or outright steal them, its ability to travel with money without restriction, ability to move money anywhere trivially without restriction, as a store of value, etc.  Bitcoin will be great for world-wide remittances, for the unbanked, for storage of wealth outside the system, for programmable contracts, for large transactions between millionaires, businesses and small countries that bypass the governments that control the banking systems etc. But bitcoin has a lot of growing up to do before it reaches that potential.

I'm not spending my bitcoin without a discount. Why would I? Without a discount I'd rather use my credit card, get consumer protections, thank you points, etc. and let Expedia pay the credit card fees that cover those perks for me.
I'm not one of the unbanked. I have options and you have to pay me to get me to part with my digital gold.  You can take my fraud ridden, charge-back prone, deprecating, high fee, long delay to receive payment plastic if you're not gonna recognize what bitcoin gives you and discount me appropriately.

Yes, business ownership is another form of generational wealth.
As for gold, an oz of gold is an oz of gold just as an acre of land is an acre of land no matter the time that goes by.  It's price is a function of the politics and economy of the moment.  But long term it remains a limited, scarce, portable chunk of permanent wealth.  It's better than real estate as it has no real estate taxes, doesn't need upkeep, etc.  If you're worried about catching every rise and dip of a short term price, you're thinking like a trader not a wealth accumulator.  I trade too but I don't trade property, I accumulate it.

Yes, both you and I are well aware of the arguments for inflation.  Those that run the inflation scheme make sure of that.  Let's just say that's not the only side of the story, but you won't hear the other sides unless you go find them yourself.  The supposed short term dip in growth due to deflation is at best less of a problem than its made out to be while the long term detrimental effects of inflation (which we are all starting to see) certainly outweigh it.
Even if the arguments against deflation were true there is still the little matter of the wealth redistribution that comes from our current inflation system.  Do we want to exchange the supposed avoidance of short-term dips in growth for letting the government and financial system take a constant chunk of the nations wealth every year (over and above taxes already taken)?  The result of that is also clear to any who look...  a government and financial sector that are both nonproductive parts of the economy and yet are both massively larger than they were just a few decades ago while the rest of the economy (the productive parts!) have shrunk.
As an aisde, the real reason for inflation they never tell you.  The real reason is because our current monetary system was changed to be debt-based decades ago and now requires ever expanding amounts of debt or it collapses.  In particular it tends to collapse under deflation.  However there are other money systems that don't require ever expanding amounts of debt and don't collapse in a deflation.  But they also don't favor banks and governments so they tend to get replaced by systems that do and you won't be educated about the other systems except to be told how bad they are. Bitcoin by the way is not a debt-based money and doesn't collapse in a deflation--watch as they tell you how bad it is.
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:08:00
If that were a critical factor we'd have already seen a shift from bitcoin to some altcoin.

It's not really the price of gold that matters...  gold IS money, fiat (and dollars in particular) are debt.  What has major implications is not gold price, it's who holds how much gold--whoever holds the gold makes the rules (price is arbitrary).
Once you realize it's the amount of gold that matters and not the price (afterall, the price could literally change overnight if gold were remonetized), you see what is really going on with nations like China and Russia strongly buying gold right now.  They are making a play to have a larger say in any future monetary system.

I agree they should make their costs (and thus their clients costs) clear. But you can't expect tney will magically always be profitable and competitive or else eat the loss for you. They don't control the price of bitcoin nor every other miner. By being a client who cloud mines you are taking the risk of loss associated with mining, not them. Thats why they are structured this way, so they make money from fees while their clients take the risks associated with mining. Welcome to those risks coming home to roost... they go along with the gains made from mining in the past. Cloud mining was always a dumb idea for a number of reasons imo. If mining was so profitable and risk free they would just do it themselves and not sell it to you for a fee.

Right, barter has problems which is why a common medium of exchange would emerge naturally.  This exchange medium naturally emerged due to having certain properties that made it a good medium of exchange:  people wanted it (it had value itself), it was divisible, portable, durable, didn't go bad, was difficult to counterfeit and easy to verify.  Examples are salt, peppercorns, copper, silver, gold, etc.
But barter is the simplest form of trade.  It's the starting point.  I'm not even sure of your point...  yes it has downsides but it still happened in the past just as it still happens today.  And money evolved out of it as a solution to the problems of barter.

Is it just me or is that article largely incoherent?  For example the article's first point seems to be that people don't want to save money?  His second point tries to address arguments about the unbanked by immediately claiming people sending money have money thus could have bank accounts?  Most the rest of his points are similarly odd or non sequitur.
I agree with him that western union is not suffering at the moment.  I also agree the business case for a competing cash transfer service isn't great...  but that's because bitcoin doesn't require 3rd parties.  Once bitcoin gets more established and can be used easily as cash in various places you can send bitcoin/cash to anyone anywhere yourself instantly.  That doesn't bode well for the entire cash transfer business.  He seems incapable of seeing a future where cash transfer services are obsoleted by open digital cash.  His only argument against that is current bitcoin volatility (and perhaps an odd argument I'm not sure I understand about how people won't switch to a new form of cash because today they could switch to bank accounts but don't).

You are clueless. Why are you even posting on this? Proof of work is a practical solution to the byzantine generals problem which allows decentraliztion in a public ledger. Without decentraliztion there is no immutability because the ledger can be changed by the controlling authority. Hashes don't stop the controlling authority from changing the data and recomputing new hashes.

You don't seem to get that bitcoin is global and is open to anyone.  If NY wants to sit out while the rest of the world develops the next generation smart money that is completely their loss.  What is actually likely to eventually happen however is they wake up and repeal or tone down the BltLicense.  Of course by then it might be too late...  synergies have a way of setting up around particular locations and NY might have already shot itself in the foot.

Hashes don't stop the controlling authority from changing the data and recomputing new hashes. That everyone can see the hashes changed doesn't make the data immutable. Everyone can see the data changed regardless anyway if it's a public ledger. The issue is can the data be changed, and in a centralized blockchain it can be, while in bitcoin's blockchain it cannot.

If bitcoinxt starts to become big enough, which it probably will, it will force bitcoin core to answer with a reasonable block size increase update of its own rather than continuing to ignore everyone. So go ahead and switch to bitcoinxt, then when bitcoin core is forced to pull their heads out, you can switch back. So in the end your questions are irrelevant because bitcoinxt isn't likely to be adopted, it's just a means to force bitcoin core to act.

If a blockchain is centralized it can be changed, period. The chain of hashes only insure data integrity not immutability. The central party can simply update the entire chain if they want, that's what centralized means. There is no immutability when someone controls the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:00:19
I hate when hating makes sense.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:23:10
The hashes are only part of what makes it immutable. Decentralized proof of work is another key part. If the blockchain is centralized there is no immutability as the hash chain could be changed by the controlling party.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:07:16
Do you even understand what you just said?  Let's sum up:
1)  A centralized blockchain is not immutable in the least as it can be changed at the whim of the central authority.   Any portion of the blockchain could be revised by the central authority and the hash chain recalculated. That's what it means to have a centralized blockchain (and it has an advantage if what you want is the ability to change transactions, for example to reverse a transaction).
2) The Bitcoin blockchain on the other hand is immutable within the limits of the proof of work consensus strategy.  You cannot reverse transactions or otherwise modify the blockchain, not because of a chain of hashes but because the work/cost required to create a false/modified blockchain is too great due to the proof of work strategy.  Some entity with money/processing power greater than 50% of the entire bitcoin mining network could control new entries on the blockchain as is a well known limitation of bitcoin.  Yet still older entries on the blockchain are more and more costly to modify until they reach the point of practical impossibility.
These are not remotely similar cases.  One case is not immutable at all, it changes at the whim of a single entity.  The other is immutable from a practical standpoint from ANYONE, within the economic constraints set by the combined power of its mining network.  To sit there and claim a centralized blockchain is the same as the bitcoin blockchain is absurd.  To claim a centralized blockchain is immutable is simply false.

@_date: 2015-08-03 04:51:44
This obvious fact is why I suspect that those that argue for keeping the block size limit are really trying to move value away from bitcoin and into alternative systems.  It's unlikely people are too blind to understand would happen if the limit stays, so it must be that they actually WANT bitcoin to be crippled because they are invested in some competing system they expect to benefit.

10% reserve requirements haven't been used in years. I think the requirement is  now at 3% or something but it doesn't matter because in the 90s banks started playing accounting games called sweeps as everything is computerized. Basically every night they sweep demand account money (which has a reserve requirement) into savings accounts which don't have a reserve requirement, then they do their reserve requirement accounting. In the morning they sweep it back. I am not kidding. As a result there basically is no practical reserve requirement at all and hasn't been for around 20 years. However even this isn't that relevant anymore as money creation is so much larger in the shadow banking market the whole notion of a reserve ratio requirement being the key factor to money creation hasn't been relevant in decades.
Zerohedge has had a few articles on modern money creation and shadow banking over the years... here is one:
The bottom line is there is no reserve requirement anymore. It's nice to think about to help understand how money comes from thin air but it hasn't actually been relevant for decades in this world of modern banking and finance.

You don't have to predict it, you just have to act when it becomes apparent.  My point is there is significant economic incentive for people to act when it does become apparent (even slightly apparent).  And the actions won't take any time at all to have a drastic impact on the value of both chains.  As a result I don't think two chains that stem from the same blockchain can coexist for very long.  As soon as one looks to be the winner market forces will decimate the loser.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:03:13
This entire bullshit debate is over an appeal to authority--of a few devs. That's what it's about.  A group of devs are holding the entire blockchain hostage, not for any rational technical reasons but because they want to turn bitcoin into something else entirely and are in the position to cause it by gridlocking progress. Shit-all-nothing has happened in bitcoin for years as every significant attempt to progress has been shut down by them.
At some point you say these aren't devs anymore, these are anti-devs and you fork and leave them behind so progress can actually be made again.

The key breakthrough of bitcoin is how it achieves distributed consensus via proof of work and a blockchain.  If you don't understand this (and you DON'T) then you don't understand bitcoin, period.  Go read section "4. Proof of Work" in the original bitcoin whitepaper (and the rest of it while you're at it) or read any of the many essays on distributed consensus with proof of work that have been written since bitcoin arrived.  Keep researching until you understand it (a tip off will be when you discover how proof of work is NOT an "anti-spam algorithm" ). If you do so you might actually understand what bitcoin is and why its data is immutable in contrast to any centralized blockchain strategy.  Until then you will remain completely ignorant about the subject you're trying to talk about and would do better to stop posting and making yourself look foolish.

Bitcoin core won't increase block size unless there is enough pressure from bitcoinxt to force them to do something.

That doesn't keep you from using your bitcoin, it keeps you from using their site to buy more.

Actually what you are missing and why the arguments are so bad is this whole debate really isn't about block size, it's about the future direction of bitcoin. Those that want bitcoin to scale and continue moving forward and improving as was always intended are for a block increase. Those that think the future rests in sidechains, lightning, or some other 2.0/altcoin direction are for keeping bitcoin from growing which will force new growth and usage into those sorts of alternate systems.
The subtle lie being pushed on the less aware is the 2.0 options can't happen with a larger bitcoin block size--they can just fine.

Sorry no.  Nobody could afford to send that much spam.  It's only possible today because genuine transactions are already almost at the cap so adding some extra spam is nothing.

In the future (perhaps not far off) if bitcoin continues to grow the large mempool of waiting transactions won't be spam, they will be genuine transactions that are waiting and waiting.  This will absolutely happen if bitcoin blocksize remains capped.  The block size cap is a usage/bandwidth cap, it means bitcoin cannot grow to accept more than trivial number of transactions.  Fees don't fix this--fees don't create more bandwidth.  This is a huge problem and points out that the biggest threat to bitcoin is internal--a few core devs trying to cripple bitcoin via block size caps to push blockstream.

Bullshit.  Bitcoin has been running for years without regularly hitting any block size limit.  Bitcoin running limited, hitting that limit and running with a large mempool (which means many transactions are NOT being served), is not something that has never happened regularly and absolutely is "something different!"
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:10:29
If you are one of those whose transactions are not being served because there is no bandwidth for it, you will say it doesn't work and go find a system that actually functions.

Why don't you publish a paper showing how a basic extension of what already works will suddenly fail to continue working when it has worked fine for years and been incredibly successful?  Why don't you publish a paper showing how you've proven some alternative solution will not only work but will actually succeed in the market as bitcoin has?
If you're really a computer scientist with any depth of experience on projects that have succeeded (and failed), then you should be aware that what the small block size devs are doing violates several common practices in software development.  It's extremely difficult to get an opensource project to the level of success bitcoin has reached.  This is not a trivial thing and demands respect, care and proper management.  In software development you normally code for the issues that exist now, not for every possible theoretical problem that might exist in the future--when the future arrives those problems might not exist as you expect or might be solved other ways and in the meantime you've derailed your project.  You do not take a proven project, strategy, and code base and neuter it hoping some completely unproven alternate project will manage to adopt the success of the proven project.  You especially do not do the above with overly complex and completely unproven notions when a much simpler and proven solution already exists.
The direction some devs are trying to go is so ridiculous and so against basic principles of software project management I can only assume those that support it are either completely incompetent at running large projects or are purposefully trying to sabotage bitcoin for the benefit of other systems.  And I don't say that lightly.

It's unimaginable to me that anyone has to explain these things to otherwise intelligent developers.  I simply don't believe these people don't already get such basic points of common sense so I have to presume they have an ulterior motive to be stonewalling a block size change.  
In other words you can explain it a thousand ways to Friday and it won't make any difference.  It's not that they don't get it... they get it, they absolutely get it--but what you don't realize is they most likely WANT to disrupt bitcoin.  You think you can explain to them how their lack of action will negatively effect bitcoin and that will make them change their mind...  but it won't because negatively effecting bitcoin is their goal.

I'm not sure if you're being purposely obtuse or if you really don't know what this entire debate is about.  The "altcoin" is the crippled version of bitcoin, unable to scale to handle users much beyond those that exist now.  Any scaling of this cripplecoin must then be handled by other technologies (conveniently supplied by the company many core devs are now associated with).  Bitcoin was always meant to scale itself (that's the real bitcoin, the one in the white paper) and will again when this coup attempt is defeated.

It's not bitcoin getting better, it's an alternative view of bitcoin layered over bitcoin while preventing bitcoin itself from growing.  Bitcoin itself seems to be getting worse as a result, at least it's not being allowed to scale.

This debate has positively destroyed any respect I had for quite a number of people and this nonsense adds to that.
A cursory glance comparing my post history to the guy you claim is my sock puppet account makes it clear we're not the same person. I edit most my longer posts (and a good number of the shorter ones)--it's a bad habit of mine.

Spam attacks on bitcoin are nothing new, have been happening on occasion since the beginning and yet there has been no serious problems for all these years now because there was no nearby cap that limited the bandwidth of confirming transactions to manage the situation.  Now there is a cap that is being reached and it is rapidly fucking up the system (which is no surprise as it was never meant to actually be reached!).  So rather than incorrectly calling people liars why don't you look around at reality and wake the fuck up.

@_date: 2015-07-08 13:14:23
What this means is right now bitcoin is broken. It's not broken because a hundred different wallet creators haven't added some new fee features that nobody even knew about, it's broken because a block size cap that was expected to be removed years ago has not been removed due to a few devs and their agenda.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:43:07

The negatives of a block size increase... what a joke. There are no rational negatives for a block size increase. Yes the block size gets bigger and takes more bandwidth and disk space, that's the unavoidable consequence of growth. That is not a negative, it's reality everyone that read the original white paper should have realized from day one. If you don't take more bandwidth and space you're not growing, you're not serving transactions, instead you're refusing to serve peiple and pushing them out of bitcoin into something else that will serve them. I've never heard anything so stupid in all my life as these "reasons" to avoid letting bitcoin catch on and be used. It's like I'm in bizarro world where success is failure and failure is success: "oh no, so many people are using our service it takes more disk space and bandwidth to serve them, we can't have that! We better throttle the system so we can save space and chase those people away." Do you think making bitcoin an exclusive club for only a limited number of users not much larger than there are now makes bitcoin successful or useful? Do you think people will stick around and use a system that doesn't have the bandwidth to serve them or will they switch to something else that doesn't have morons from bizarro world at the helm?
The consequence of not letting bitcoin scale is people and value that would otherwise use bitcoin will be forced into other systems. And what bitcoin loses other systems will gain. So do I think those that are against block size increase are too stupid to understand this, or do I think they actually want that to happen because they have some interest in these other systems that will benefit? Duh! What else am I to think? I can't believe this conversation is actually happening. The small block size folks must have a very dim view of the intelligence of everyone else to presume we won't be able to understand what is really happening here.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:55:11

If you're not paying taxes they will put a lien on your house which prevents you from selling it.  But sure, if you pay your taxes you can sell your house and get your equity out of it.  What you can't do is keep a house and not pay a percentage of what its worth every year.  Also equity in a house is also not easily moved.  If you were in a crisis ridden country, like several countries out there right now, it's difficult to sell a home without taking a big hit on value and even if you could it's not so easy to move the money or take it with you if you wanted to get out of the country.  I'm not saying houses are bad, but they have some disadvantages as an asset that bitcoin doesn't have.

The bitcoin environment infrastructure is not mature and robust enough yet for trading let alone leveraged trading. Most exchanges have failed, many taking customer funds with them. On significant moves systems go down or are taken down as you point out. The bottom line is the systemic risks are significantly  larger than any trading edge. The rational conclusion is you can't trade bitcoin and expect to turn a profit.

I think you have that backwards.  Advocates of bigger blocks are focused on adoption, not value.  Value will follow.  The small block folks are focused on shifting value and adoption away from bitcoin and into other potential layers.  I think it's wrong headed as that sort of development can and should happen later.  But the biggest problem is the small block devs are trying to literally force their view onto everyone else by refusing to agree to any change.  This is on top of their having conflicts of interest in that they are employed by a firm that benefits from bitcoin being crippled.

Bitcoin isn't going down, but it's simply not working for many users anymore either.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:06:56
One side is both financially and technically reckless, the other is neither. The side that is both doesn't care if they are reckless because they think they're making their own perfect system to be the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrencies and fuck the risk and anyone who has a different view (or perhaps they actually want to take bitcoin down to build up blockstream or some other system).  They could easily implement their new system layers on top of a bitcoin with a larger block size (or as an altcoin), but they're not interested in being cautious or in anything that might be an alternative to their new layer.  Again if they were executives of a company they would be fucking fired.
They probably don't realize it yet but by refusing all compromise they've lost a tremendous amount of respect and trust from the community that will come back and bite them later.  Meanwhile there will be a fork and the 1MB hard-heads will be on the losing end of it.  There is no practical alternative because a limited bitcoin won't have the bandwidth to serve the users that will come in on the next price swing up and everyone will see that in time.

 There are no problems. The problems claimed from the small block size crowd if bitcoin is allowed to scale are theoretical future issues that will be solved automatically by progress of technology.

Lots of altcoins offer advantages.  But they have the decency to be altcoins and compete on their own.  They don't change bitcoin from the inside, blocking consensus on how bitcoin was originally supposed to grow.  This is literally a coup d'état on bitcoin from a single company that hired a group of bitcoin core devs.  
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:00:43
It's not the size of bitcoin, it's the political structure. A few devs with alternative views on what bitcoin should be are preventing bitcoin itself from scaling. This should not be allowed to happen. A hard fork is needed both to remove the block size cap and to move the core codebase away from these devs that are holding bitcoin back. IMO the bitcoin community gets closer to recognizing this more each day.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:44:41
To say nothing of the fact fees can't solve the problem of transaction bandwidth being too low.  If you can only serve a certain number of transactions over a period of time you can only serve a certain number of users.  Fees can't address that.  Fees can only decide which users pay enough to get served while everyone else waits and waits (until they leave for another system with the bandwidth to serve them).

Bitcoin will function just fine thank you, even if the community fractures.  The community has fractured from altcoins and any number of things and bitcoin has continued chugging away for years.  It's how these things grow and evolve and it's normal and healthy.  However if bitcoin is not allowed to scale that actually is a technical problem that could destroy bitcoin.  Don't minimize the real problem here in defense of some view of "community" that is totally beside the point.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:54:07
Yeah, let's limit the bandwidth and keep people out of bitcoin to "increase strength and security."

Larger transactions taking more processing power is irrelevant.  Is there some reason you're bringing that up?  Yes, running a node won't be possible on a raspberry pi as bitcoin grows up.  You might even need special hardware at some point in the future.  Does that surprise you? It doesn't surprise me.
Back to the point I made, do you think it's possible for a spammer to pay the money to send 19MB+ of spam transactions for any consistent period of time to make a cap get hit like it is today?  And if you think so, bully for you, I disagree and think you're out of your mind.  It doesn't mean I was lying.

I watch markets because they tell the truth. It's where people are voting with their cash. Litecoin is up around 800% since this bitcoin cap drama blew up while bitcoin has done nothing. Why is that? If bitcoin had that move it would be at new highs. But bitcoin actually can't handle that sort of price increase because it would get jammed due to the block size cap. Bitcoin can't move up so it doesn't; litecoin can move up, so it does. Does that worry you? It worries me.

My view comes from being a long term holder of bitcoin who got in with the understanding of how bitcoin itself would scale.

What one group of the devs see as "bitcoin" is very different than what the other group sees.

Are you purposefully misleading people or are you really that ignorant?
Gavin is not employed by a company that gains from his manipulation of the direction of bitcoin.  The blockstream devs are.
Gavin is following the original direction of bitcoin everyone has been onboard with (and has been functional) for years, not some new direction based on overly complicated vaporware.  His "lobbying" has been to convince the blockstream devs who refuse to let bitcoin grow as was always intended to get a consensus.  The possible XT fork is an option that came about as a result of being unable to get consensus out of the blockstream devs.  It's an attempt to keep bitcoin moving forward as was always intended rather than letting it get derailed by a group of devs with an extreme conflict of interest.
Gavin is posting his view on a public blog with well reasoned arguments targeted to devs and the larger, more educated public.  The blockstream devs are here on reddit trying to to manipulate the reddit hive mind with very little in the way of scholarly argument.  They are posting under sock puppet accounts, using concern trolling to stir up FUD, and even sending nasty-grams directly to the inboxes of people who disagree with them (me for one), etc.  They are being douche-bags of the highest order and have completely lost my trust and respect.  Even if you don't recognize the bullshit tactics they are using their conflict of interest is stark for anyone to see and is in direct contrast to the original vision of bitcoin we all signed up for.

You won't like my answer.  I think they aren't interested in bitcoin succeeding but in a modified altcoin version of bitcoin.  They are willing to fuck bitcoin and all bitcoin holders to make their altcoin.  Most real bitcoin users and holders bought into bitcoin and aren't interested in a new altcoin that might or might not succeed--in the end they will not put up with this shit.  The proper way forward is to recognize bitcoin for what it is, listen to bitcoin holders and users, and let bitcoin grow.  THEN build on your new layers and let them prove themselves in the market.  If your new product is so shitty it can't win the market on its own merits and you think have to neuter bitcoin to give your product a chance, it will never succeed anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:17:40
I think you mean I'm trying to educate people to the bullshit that is going on around here lately.
I'm sorry but you small block size cap guys are idiots. The cap on block size means bitcon CANNOT handle more than a certain number of users at a time. Once usage hits a certain level and more users than it can handle try to use it, it falls apart--period! There is no solution within the bitcoin system. Increasing fees doesn't help because it's not possible to serve that number of transactions regardless of fees. What happens is a fee increase war occurs and still some people are left waiting and waiting as a capped bitcoin CANNOT handle beyond a certain level of demand. Do you think those users will think bitcoin works? It's a broken system--broken by design. It requires an outside fix. And guess what, the blockstream devs come in with their solution to "save the day"... their business addresses the problem they caused by not increasing the cap. It's like they cut you to sell you a band-aid. Of course in reality it will never reach this point because bitcoin users won't be stupid enough to use such a busted system and will leave to alternative technologies that aren't capped.
The solution is trivial.  Remove the silly cap!  It was never meant to remain.

There are no problems in option A that option B solves. Option B creates problems. Option B does not create a fee market, it fails to function. Fees cannot increase bandwidth to serve a growing number of customers, they can only decide who gets served and who waits and waits until they go elsewhere to another service that actually has the bandwidth to serve its customers. Do you think a service that can't actually service customers such that they must go elsewhere will be around for long? If you doubt it imagine you are in an apartment building with bandwith limited internet such that everyone in the building cannot be served... does increasing fees to use the bad service solve anything? Or do people just go live elsewhere that has higher bandwidth? Option B is a massive fail, period.

There will not be two versions of the blockchain for long.  There would be an economic incentive to sell your coins on the chain seen as the loser to buy more bitcoin on the winning blockchain.  This will force the value of the losing chain towards zero at an accelerating rate until it is dead.  IMO it would happen quite rapidly, perhaps in a few hours once a leading chain becomes apparent.  Maybe within a few minutes.

Bitcoin is like owning real estate that has no property taxes on it.
As a home owner you hold property but must pay property taxes to the goverment where the property resides.  Property taxes must always be paid or you lose your property. You don't control how much those property taxes are, those that receive the taxes set the rates. There is no way to actually buy property that doesn't come with a cash flow payment to government. So do you really own your property or are you merely leasing from the government for as long as they allow you? 
Similarly your "insured" money is really owned and controlled by government.  They control the form, function, and value of it, you only hold any value in it at their whim.  
Bitcoin is like owning real estate that has no property taxes on it. As it exists in cyberspace it exists everywhere, so it's like real estate that travels with you. Like physical real estate there is a finite amount of bitcoin. Unlike money or physical property that are really owned and controlled by governments, you can own and control bitcoin yourself in ways not possible with any other asset in history.

The world isn't always a happy fun place where everyone cooperates for a common goal. Sometimes people have different views for what they want, conflicts of interest, etc. In this case a number of people don't want bitcoin to scale for various reasons, none of them helpful if you want bitcoin itself to exist in a meaningful way in the future. Now maybe you're one of those that don't want bitcoin to exist in any meaningful way in the future for your own reasons... but if not, you should step aside and let those will the balls to protect bitcoin speak up. It's not about being submissive and cooperating with some supposed authority, it's about doing what is right for bitcoin even if it is contentious to some.

It would help because it would increase the bandwidth that drains the waiting transactions  (spam or not). The more bandwidth the faster the drain, the less bandwidth the faster the clog builds up. The only reason this spam attack works at all is because of the silly block size cap. Remove the cap and these attacks wouldn't work at all because bitcoin would have the bandwidth to clear the backlog and keep it clear.
But now you and the other troll devs can try to use this to convince everyone how bitcoin can't work without new added layers even as you refuse to raise the block limit that is causing the problem.

That's the thing, a group of you are more interested in personalities than bitcoin. You quote these guys and repeat their arguments but few seem to notice the technical arguments are weak, the market/economic view is plain wrong, and the plan forward is bad and not inclusive of what bitcoin users want and need. I don't give a shit who does what or what someone says, I can think for myself and don't have to rely on the opinion of others. I just want the direction to be right and actually work. From what I can see right now there will be a fork and block size will increase because that is what will  be required soon. Even if blockstream later manages to succed in taking bitcoin in a new direction (which is a big if), it doesn't change what must and will happen first. In the meantime I think it's very shortsighted of the small block size group to cause such a rift in bitcoin at this early point and I think they will regret it later. They are wrong on their direction for a number of reasons and their "no compromise" attitude will lose them much of the trust and respect they have now in the process.
Bitcoin is a lot bigger than a handul of bitcoin core devs. They will discover that soon if they don't know it now.

As long as the cap is significantly higher than the rate of normal transactions there is no problem (as we've seen for years now with bitcoin). It's only when the level of transactions approaches the cap as is happening now that there is a problem.
To say raising the limit won't help the problem is absurd and flies in the face of years of bitcoin working just fine.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:38:22
Look around. Bitcoin is grinding to a halt because the block size cap is so low it allows attacks that clog it up enough it can't clear. These attacks are happening now and work because of this drama and inaction around the block size debate.  There are many with an interest in nerfing bitcoin for the benefit of alternative systems and they drive this drama. They want bitcoin to be jammed up just like it is now.  So yes, anyone supporting what is right now causing bitcoin to not funtion properly is a fucking troll and can go die. Bitcoin either scales or value will be driven elsewhere.

The attacks wouldn't work if the block size were raised because the network could easily clear the backlog and prevent it from building up. This whole thing only is happening because the limited block size cap does not give bitcoin the bandwidth to clear itself.

I'm well aware of the arguments that larger block size leads to centralization.  I think they are bullshit.  Larger miners and node processors =\= centralization.  Only an idiot thinks bitcoin can grow to enable the world and the processing units will remain individuals running raspberry pi's.  There will be big, professional entities, just as there are for the internet.  But that doesn't mean they are centralized, just as they aren't for the internet.

I'm shocked this blatant attack on bitcoin is coming from within.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:52:19
It's an attack not a test. It is happening due to the low block size cap and will be a continuing problem until the cap is raised.

If a cap exists and gets hit for long periods then bitcoin starts acting badly in various ways.  This means a cap can't be used as any sort of viable strategy to limit transactions beyond unexpected transient issues (e.g. temporary spam attacks).  It great that you and other can think of all these possible problems that might occur, but a block size cap is not really a solution to any of them.  I'm not convinced there needs to be a cap at all.  The cap should go and future problems (if they actually occur) can be dealt with as they arise.  If we don't get rid of the cap (or at least raise it) we might as well all shift over to some altcoin that isn't limited because the value won't stick around in a transaction limited bitcoin.  
The fact that limiting bitcoin will cause value to flee bitcoin for other technologies has convinced me that those who are against raising the block size cap WANT that outcome to occur.  There are any number of bitcoin alternatives and people supporting those alternatives that would love for bitcoin to stumble and fall.  So pardon me but I simply don't trust anyone who argues for keeping the cap.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:04:41
Are you unaware that Bitcoin simply isn't working for many people?  Transactions are not going through for many users.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:34:32
Bitcoin has been running for years and never in the way you suggest.  To casually claim otherwise is absurd--it's up to the small block group to prove bitcoin can function with a large mempool as that is the unknown case.  
In my view a block size limit is a limit on the bandwidth of the system--basically a usage limit.  This is not acceptable.  The current spam transactions that are sitting around not being acted on will be REAL transactions by next year.  That creates a non-functioning system--real users will have transactions sit around for unknown periods of time (to say nothing of the unknowns of a large mempool detailed by Mike Hearn).  This is not solved by fees, this is a functional/bandwidth limit!  The whole situation is outrageous given that its so trivial to fix by raising the cap and with much less risk than this full mempool bullshit.  The only reason this situation exists is political--some people (apparently including you) WANT to limit the usage of bitcoin to move its growth into secondary systems.  Fuck you for trying to fuck with bitcoin's growth and usage!  Why don't you clearly admit what you're trying to do so everyone can be clear.  Stop this bullshit about how it's no problem to keep bitcoin limited.  You're taking a very sly and douche-bag approach.  Stop it!

Yes, it was an insult. Like your view on block size is an insult to bitcoin users.
I don't code in the bitcoin space, I'm an engineering director of a private silicon valley firm and my current project involves test systems for the NASA orion project. I don't claim expertise in cryptography but I know markets, software, and how to run software teams and projects. I have been following bitcoin since &lt; $1 and holding since $10. The group of you holding the block size increase back are out of your minds, have lousy technical arguments, and are playing risky games with a $3 billion dollar project like stupid, spoiled, children.

We'll see won't we.  The billions in bitcoin is a significant incentive for the bitcoin market place to not fuck up (or correct itself when it does fuck up).  That there is some nonsense going on now I think will be short lived--once people figure out not expanding the block size cap is fucking things up they will expand the cap.  And if I'm somehow wrong (which I doubt) and it doesn't fuck things up then that would be a nice thing to learn as well.  Either way it doesn't put litecoin ahead.

Not raising the block limit will end bitcoin (or rather transfer its value into competitive systems) before a 2nd layer technology gets developed enough to save it.

Maybe you've missed the months and months of attempts to compromise and negotiate.  The reality is a particular group of devs are not budging an inch.  Again this is because it is to their advantage to not compromise but just leave bitcoin as it is and refuse to make any changes.  By default this puts bitcoin where they want it, and to the disadvantage of bitcoin itself.

You can't solve a problem of lack of bandwidth by higher fees for access.  A system that is too bandwidth limited to serve it's users isn't fixed by making the service more expensive.

@_date: 2015-07-09 00:06:27
I'm sorry but you small block size cap guys are idiots.  The cap on block size means bitcon CANNOT handle more than a certain number of users at a time.  Once usage hits a certain level and more users than it can handle try to use it, it falls apart--period!  There is no solution within the bitcoin system.  Increasing fees doesn't help because it's not possible to serve that number of transactions regardless of fees.  What happens is a fee increase war occurs and still some people are left waiting and waiting as a capped bitcoin CANNOT handle beyond a certain level of demand.  Do you think those users will think bitcoin works?  It's a broken system--broken by design.  It requires an outside fix.  And guess what, the blockstream devs come in with their solution to "save the day"...  their business addresses the problem they caused by not increasing the cap.  It's like they cut you to sell you a band-aid.  Of course in reality it will never reach this point because bitcoin users won't be stupid enough to use such a busted system and will leave to alternative technologies that aren't capped.
Wake up fools!

He is putting economists on a pedestal. But still many of the devs do not understand markets nor human psychology/incentives. They would've never created a successful bitcoin because they do not know how to set and balance incentives.  Satoshi got it right and that is an incredible achievement that demands respect. Now these devs are moving away from Satoshi's working idea to one that may or may not work. They should not be allowed to put bitcoin at risk in this way, especially when we don't need too! Bitcoin can scale as it always was going to and 2nd layer technologies can later be created and prove themselve on their merit. This bullshit of crippling a successful technology in order to force people to use some unproven 2nd layer technology is incredibly risky and stupid.

You repeat talking points like "centralized" and "free transactions" like a good parrot but have you actually tried thinking for yourself? A block size cap keeps bitcoin from being able to handle more people. It's a usage cap. You are arguing for keeping the usage of bitcoin capped. Is that what you want? 
If there is a modem being shared by a growing community of users and the fixed bandwidth starts to degrade service for everyone does increasing fees to use the modem solve anything? When people start to complain about the service being shitty does telling them they just want cheap service solve anything? If you actually think about the problem you realize you have to increase the bandwidth of the modem or people will go somewhere else.

I understand that's what they think, but they are wrong.  They could think the moon is made of green cheese and it wouldn't make it so.  Bitcoin has had its way forward since day 1.  If they didn't want to be part of that they could make an altcoin.  Instead they are trying to invalidate the entire basis of bitcoin based on flawed assumptions (which again are convenient to them and fly in the face of what bitcoin has been since day 1).  It's unlikely they will succeed.
Non-programmers have a tendency to put developers on a pedestal.  Most of them do not deserve it.  I think if you examine what these people you are putting your trust in have actually DONE, you will be underwhelmed.  They did not create bitcoin.  They likely do not have the understanding of money, markets, and human psychology to have created it and apparently are not good choices for leading it forward.  They don't seem to understand why it works and why what they are doing risks breaking it (or worse they don't care).  They have been navel gazing for years and now suddenly are trying to prevent bitcoin from maturing as was intended (and/or are trying to redirect its value for their own ends).  
I simply do not trust them to build functional 2nd generation/layer technologies without those technologies proving themselves FIRST.  Bitcoin has proven itself.  It is not likely that any of the planned 2nd gen technologies will function correctly in the time expected, be adopted, and actually result in what was expected.  That is just the nature of complex systems and a fickle public.  Bitcoin was a rare project, an exception not the rule.  I'm happy to be proven wrong but prove me wrong by showing success FIRST, don't merely presume the devs will get it right eventually and allow them to cripple the project that actually HAS proven itself.  So until these magical new layers arrive and work and are adopted bitcoin cannot be allowed to be crippled for the unproven dreams of a group of egotistical devs.  Otherwise the potential damage is huge.

That's one complaint and it's absurd.  Some miners who might have some latency problems that might reduce their profits should not be allowed to be a driving force to cripple bitcoin.The entire point of bitcoin is market forces drive the crypto forward.  When usage goes up the businesses that serve those users might change.  That's how a free market works.  You go from CPU mining to GPU mining to ASIC mining, etc. People get obsoleted.  That's the game.  You don't stop moving forward because your current market providers would rather things stayed the same!  Sorry Internet, Microsoft wants you to not grow so they can remain competitive and profitable.  I don't think so!

Because people are holding bitcoin for its store of value function and future price recognition rather than spending it while it's cheap as heck.  Bitcoin isn't a computer or a phone, it's digital gold--you vault it.  Cutting usage is exactly what I've done and is how I expect most informed, reasonable people to act when digital gold is selling absurdly cheap.
Not everyone would agree with me but  going forward I actually don't expect bitcoin transactions to be that high.  I expect a lot more long term storage than casual/common transactions.   I see bitcoin as more of a value storage medium (again, like gold), not as a paypal replacement.  I also don't see the market for bitcoin being the average, moronic, indebted consumer.  Those people don't have any need for a wealth storage asset--they don't have any wealth to store.  They need bitcoin about as much as they need gold.

Geez dude, a dollar bill is a Federal Reserve NOTE (it's written right on the top of it, go read it).  It's not an asset, it's worth nothing by itself, it's an obligation owed to you by the Federal Reserve and that obligation is represented by a green piece of paper.  It's basically an IOU. They can default on that obligation at any time and you'll have nothing but a green paper IOU that wasn't honored.  
The only reason you think it's an asset is because everyone else (also completely ignorant about money) is passing around these IOUs like they were assets and generally will take them as if they were an asset.  But they are not assets no matter how much you might mistakenly think they are, they are debt notes.  They are IOUs and have various liabilities built in.
TL;DR:  When you own cash you own an IOU from the Federal Reserve that says THEY (not you) own and control any actual value behind and/or represented by the money while you hold nothing but a note saying they owe you that value (which of course you have no way of actually collecting from them).

Holding bitcoin also doesn't infringe on anyone else's needs. If you were to buy and store away large amounts of oil, grain, water, or any other commodity actually needed by people then society might have a valid complaint against such "hoarding". But monetary commodites like bitcoin and gold can be held without infringing on society as they exist for the purpose of monetary storage/transference and are largely useless otherwise. This is actually an important property of a good money... to be useless beyond being a ledger so "hoarding" is a non issue.

Your dollar bills are notes.  They are pieces of paper that represent a debt.  You might think the paper is the asset but it's not.  It's a debt note that you pass around in place of an asset.  Tomorrow it could suddenly turn into a worthless piece of paper if the debt is defaulted on--and in that case you'd rapidly discover the difference between an asset and a debt note.  That you don't understand (or ignore) that reality doesn't turn a piece of paper representing a debt into an asset.

It was a note and still is a note.  It's just a note that today cannot actually be cashed in after they defaulted on their gold obligations.  But it's still a note in the sense that YOU don't own or control any of the value represented by the note.  THEY own any and all value behind the note and/or represented by the by the note while what you hold is the note.  The difference is subtle and not understood by 99.999% of people.  When you hold cash you don't hold any value, you hold an IOU for value that is held by someone else... and you have no way to collect it from them (though you can trade the note for something of value from some other person and pass the obligation on to them).
Practically money has value in that everyone else values it and it can be passed around.  But actually, in any real legal sense, there is no actual value in the cash, there is only an IOU for value--any real, legal value to money is held by the issuer of the note.  Bitcoin also only has value in that other people value it and it can be passed around.  But the difference is when you own a bitcoin you actually own it and whatever value it represents.  When you own a dollar you don't own anything but a slip of paper saying someone else holds any associated value and that value is owed to you (with no way to collect it from them).
What is "for historical reasons" is the reasons why people are willing to mentally give value to a worthless slip of paper representing a debt that was defaulted on decades ago...  and it's an interesting commentary on the human condition.

A guy entered a bunch of "bets" against bitcoin apparently worth a about 13357 bitcoins of leverage.  As bitcoin goes up he loses bitcoin on the bets, as bitcoin goes down he gains bitcoin on the bets.  To remain in good standing with the exchange he must keep enough bitcoins available in the exchange to safely cover his bet losses or the exchange will close the bets on him.  Apparently he lost so much the exchange closed his bets.

I don't control the value of a bitcoin but at least I own the value. With a dollar you don't control the value AND you don't own the value either.  With a dollar you are legally tied to the financial solvency of another entity (that's what the note does).  Bitcoin doesn't have that problem.

@_date: 2015-04-01 14:08:02
I'm not of the opinion that bitcoin needs to be spent at consumer stores to grow and have value. If a store owner wants bitcoin he can offer a significant discount for it, or he can go buy it himself. Other than that he can have my fiat/debt money and the fees, fraud, chargebacks, account-freezes, and constant devaluation that goes with it. There are millions of bitcoin out there worth billions of dollars and the reason they aren't flooding the stores in exchange for products is because most people that hold them know they are worth more than what most stores offer.
What gives bitcoin value is people seeing it for what it is and buying and holding it, not people selling it for consumer junk and usually to stores that really only want dollars and sell it immediately. If 2014 &amp; 2015 have shown us anything it's that more stores accepting bitcoin (to just sell for fiat) hurts price more than helps it. Stop treating your bitcoin like you don't want it and start hoarding it as the worthy and undervalued asset that it is.
Tl;dr: I don't see dollar-based transactions as important. I see hoarding as important.

Your made false claims about wages and employment which I corrected by pointing to real data showing employment and income/wages are well below what they were before 2008.

If you know the facts and spin them to make reality seem the opposite of what it really is you are part of the problem. You dishonest and a huckster--you knowingly sell a false reality.    You have no business talking to actual honest, hardworking Americans that deserve the honest truth.  Don't ever talk to me again, you're not worthy.  Fuck off.

Correct, like dollars bitcoin also only has value in that other people value it and it can be passed around. But the difference is when you own a bitcoin you actually own it and whatever value it represents. When you own a dollar you don't own anything but a slip of paper saying someone else holds any associated value and that value is owed to you (with no way to collect it from them).
In short a bitcoin is a bitcoin, gold is gold, when you own one you own it including any and all value it has.  A dollar is a legal contract that refers to some outside value held by someone else owed to you.  Legally you don't hold the value of the dollar, someone else does and you're owed it from them.  This is a significant difference legally and it becomes a significant practical difference if and when the government and/or federal reserve start having financial problems.   In such a situation you will rapidly discover you don't actually own any value with a dollar as it quickly falls to zero.  Holding a dollar associates you financially with the solvency of another entity.  That is the obligation I've been talking about.  That doesn't happen with bitcoin or gold.

Now he csn accept a payment system nobody will use from him. I hate to break it to you but bitcoin is not going to be used to buy haircuts (or make ordinary local purchases from businesses that take creditcards). Why would anyone do that when credit cards have more consumer protections and give you perks like cash back?
Bitcoin will be huge in remittances, foreign online purchases, global value exchange,, programed transactions of various sorts, value storage, etc. Buying goods and services from your local store with bitcoin is not going to happen when credit cards are already dominant and (for that particular function) better.
Bitcoin is going to replace/dominate gold, bank wires, western union, international exchange, cash savings, collateral functions, trusts and title, etc. I doubt it will replace credit card transactions at local shops.

Some of my relatives are constantly in financial trouble.

They burned through the entire sum in a few months and were back in financial trouble within a year.  The same thing has happened on my wife's side of the family.  This personal experience is backed up by studies that estimate that 70% of people who luck into large sums of money end up broke in a few years.

@_date: 2015-04-14 15:13:17
A few comments:
- Personally I'd move the history and inner workings to a separate article.
- Like gold Bitcoin has intrinsic value that comes from its fundamental properties that make it good money.  Both bitcoin and gold derive their primary value from their nature that make them useful as a monetary instrument to account, store, and transfer value.  
- Bitcoin is a new type of monetary asset and has some advantages over gold.  It cannot be counterfeit and is trivial to validate compared to gold.  It is easier, quicker, and cheaper to transfer and divide compared to gold.  It's easier and cheaper to secure than gold (presuming you know how to secure it properly).  Unlike gold it's digital and exists everywhere so as a result you have access to it (or it "goes with you") no matter where you go or how much you own.
- The value for both bitcoin and gold is arbitrary in that it reflects the size of the market that trusts the asset and holds value in it vs the amount of asset available.  Both gold and bitcoin have a restricted amount available.  But bitcoin has much larger potential upside than gold in that it is new, not well understood by most people yet, and does not have much of a market using it yet compared to its promise of being a major global digital store of value.

First off I'm not anti US. I'm pro US, but I have a realistic view of the current situation and better information than people like you.

In 1933 the dollar was devalued around 40% overnight.  Tell us again about how the dollar purchasing power is constant on a day-to-day basis and how nobody cared about such a devaluation.  Just because you weren't alive to remember and don't know fuck-all about history doesn't mean it wasn't a big deal to Americans at the time.
In 1971 the entire world was stiffed by the US when it defaulted on its global gold obligations.  Do you think that matters?  Does it matter if a country pays what it owes to the rest of the world, especially when it's the supposed top superpower?

Bitcoin's current downtrend is only in price. I don't let a price trend throw me off what is actually happening.  Bitcoin's usefulness, usage, etc. continues to expand.  Bitcoin's price has bubbled and popped multiple times but its ongoing growth continues.  Fads don't do that.

As for the dollar devaluation, due to [the Gold Reserve Act]( one day 20 dollars would buy an oz of gold, the next day it took 35 dollars--by definition that's a loss of purchasing power.  Effect on overall prices was not that severe as the US was fighting deflation at the time.

The first part of your reply is irrelevant to the military backing the value of money argument. The second part is not what gives money value either, it might protect value when value already exists but it does not create value where none exists.

Printing money is a temporary refuge of failing states/currencies, it's not some magic solution.  If money printing actually solved anything economically it would've helped the hundreds of historical currency failures that tried it.  What it does do is transfer wealth to the politically and economically connected classes, create wealth disparity, and destabilize society.

Believe it or not your biggest problem to seeing what is really going on is probably your degree in economics.  IMO what has gained acceptance in the world of economics is what is politically useful to the current power structure, not what is actually correct.  IMO mainstream economics as it exists now will be disgraced within 20 years.  These idiots using QE and such to "manage" the economy are fucking it up beyond belief and that will become very apparent on the next 2008-like crisis where this time the Fed no longer has any room to maneuver as they are already at 0% interest rates and printing.  
I've been an online trader for 20 years since the field took off.  Every day I run multiple computer driven strategies that run in real time in addition to my regular job as Engineering Director of a silicon valley tech firm.  I get that the market is going up and that many companies (particularly ones in silicon valley here where I live) are doing fine.  I trade long a whole lot more than I trade short.  But I also understand that the monetary system changes significantly every several decades and that fiat systems don't have a long shelf life.  The dollar as the reserve currency is on its way out and that process is accelerating (if you don't see that you are not paying attention).  Global fiat systems are teetering on failure (particularly in Japan--and when they go it will be the first domino in a chain of failures as people like you wake up to the reality of the global fiat situation).
An alternative possibility (perhaps more likely) is covered in that PDF I linked yesterday "The Big Reset."  The author of that book predicts various governments currently in power (probably led by China) will implement an alternative monetary system before outright failure of the current system.  This will be something planned more along the lines of Bretton Woods, rather than a reaction to an emergency, but will be a surprise to prevent front-running the new system.  Obviously you can read the book yourself for his arguments and details.

I'll check the interest number, I've been wrong in the past once or twice before.
I agree the debt/GDP number isn't particularly useful on its own, so why do you mention it?  A related and more interesting ratio is change in GDP to change in debt.  This is called the Marginal Productivity of Debt and it measures how much additional GDP we get out of adding additional debt. This is important as we expect adding debt to give us a benefit to service the debt and then some (or else why are we borrowing?).  The amount of benefit for new debt has been falling for decades and some of us have been watching the decline as a sort of signal to the beginning of the end.  It finally fell to zero during the 2008 crisis and hasn't recovered.  So now we're getting no benefit for all the new debt burden we add.  From here GDP is not expanding to service additional debt and costs will expand budget deficits until default, restructure, or collapse.
Note that this situation has happened even at near zero interest rates so interest will not be rising in any meaningful way no matter what the Fed says.

The economy has not remotely recovered since 2008. You are being lied to and have not checked the facts. I keep having the same discussion with people like you who never look beyond the headlines you are fed. Wake up.
Go look at the data... look at employment, look at housing, look at income and wages, look at small businesses, look at household net worth, look at anything beyond the manipulated headlines and stock market and you'll find stagnation and no recovery since 2008 DESPITE the trillions of dollars printed the last many years. Then go look at any previous recession recovery and compare to this supposed recovery. There has been no recovery, there has been money printing, a resulting stock market boom, a massive transfer of wealth to the 0.1%, and a con job on the American people.
Here are some charts on a number of the above and I can look up the others like small business being at multi-decade lows, household networth and income in down-trend, etc. if you want to be totally depressed.
The con is primarily associated with counting all the massive amounts of debt and money printing as GDP additive. Print trillions and go into massive debt and claim all that as GDP additive--whee, what number do you want to see to believe in recovery because they'll just print until they hit it, nevermind what the actual economy is doing. Here's a guy who has rolled out some of that nonsense so you can see what is really happening.

There is no chance. You cannot pay all the debt off in our system or it collapses. The money itself comes into being as debt by being borrowed into existence so paying off all debt implies all money goes back to the nothing it came from (and there is no economy without money). You can't even start to pay down the debt or money starts contracting and you get recessions and depressions. The whole thing is designed to constantly expand debt. That's why any "debt ceiling" with the current monetary system is a joke.
We must get away from debt based money to have a sustainable system. Bitcoin is not a debt based money.

Normally you are right that currency is only peripheral to the economy.  However these are not normal times (as should be obvious by practically the entire world being in rare and unique monetary territory).  
Things might get solved by some globally planned monetary reset that most people don't even notice.  That's probably even the most likely outcome and likely has opportunity for gold and/or bitcoin.  But even if that happens I was still correct that our situation is incredibly dangerous and untenable.
I agree with you that for a long while you can devalue currency and have things keep humming...  that's what we've seen for the last 100 years.  But late in the game for debt-based monies that stops working and you start facing systemic failures.  I could be wrong but I think we're facing systemic issues that cannot be managed (or even delayed much longer) by devaluation.  We've reached the productive limits of debt expansion and from here it takes default, failure, or systemic restructure to reset the system to some sort of normalcy--devaluation can't do it. This is a basic fact of monetary history repeated over and over again.
The other issue in my mind is when sovereigns go broke they don't go quietly or alone.  They do everything in their power to keep the machine running even when it means robbing and enslaving their citizens while destroying the real economy.  That ties the monetary realm to the economic world the rest of have to deal with daily.  Even worse is this is the first time in history the entire world has been on a debt-based fiat system that is facing its saturation point nearly everywhere at the same time.  It's possible this could blow up like nothing the world has ever seen. If such a thing happens it will absolutely effect economies the world over.

Because bitcoin will be more secure, more accessible, more private, more fair, and more functional than existing fiat systems it will quite likely outgrow them all. This will be accelerated by the various continuing restrictions, failures, and costs of the fiat system. People don't like being constrained and losing value so they will slowly move to bitcoin as the discomfort level from being  restricted and ripped off by the fiat system rises higher than the discomforts of understanding and adopting bitcoin.

The first half of that program the finance minister doesn't even argue against gold/bitcoin but against the gold standard.  The gold standard is the mapping of a specific denomination of government controlled currency onto a specific amount of gold.  That is a sort of price fixing and like all price fixing is doomed to fail.  It's not an argument against gold or bitcoin that a certain sort of price fixing fails--the government can't maintain a fixed price on a commodity that the market in reality prices and such a mapping will fail.  Gold never failed, it is still used today as a value exchange and is held and exchanged by central banks all over the world.  The minister is banking (pun intended) on his audience's lack of education on the subject to not understand that he's not even really making an argument against bitcoin (or gold), he's making an argument against a particular type of financial system that has gold as a part of it and government as the other part--and it's the government part that breaks!

Beanie babies? You have no respect for five thousand years of history.  Beanie babies don't have five thousand years of history of being used as money.  Governments don't have vaults full of beanie babies nor do they have beanie babies on their balance sheets.  We weren't using beanie babies as the basis of our global monetary system just over 40 years ago.  Gold is a different story.
The problem with printing away debt is savings and the money of the economy also gets devalued away at the same time.  It also risks people realizing what is happening and a run to hard assets over fiat (hyperinflation).  A revaluation of gold does not have those issues.  I'm not claiming wealth gets created, it's a movement of already existing wealth being held in bonds and other foreign reserves into gold.  Anyone holding gold gets the advantage (governments), those not holding gold are victims in the value transfer.  That this is unfair doesn't mean government won't do it.  They don't hesitate to steal value from everyone else daily via fiat inflation.
Governments abandoned gold because it requires honest/responsible accounting and it's easier to simply abandon responsible monetary management and just spend what you want, print, and go into more and more debt.  Banks also prefer debt-based monies as they make out like bandits by being the middle men.  Of course what happens with fiat is the failures we're seeing today (and its going to get so much worse).  You can't simply print all your wishes true nor can you simply go into ever expanding debt no matter what today's economists might claim.  Even worse there is no actual way to manage debt between countries without an objective basis like gold--fiat has no solution, only instability and eventual failure.

I notice you don't mention small businesses are at an all time low, wages and household net worth are steeply declining, unemployment is on the rise (despite the lies to the contrary), Detroit is in ruins, homelessness is at record levels, social security is no longer solvent (and the average joe has no retirement funds to speak of), our deficits are a wreck, we have reached the limits of productive debt, etc., etc., etc.  The fact that some US companies have still managed to be profitable despite the above is merely a reflection of how the can has been kicked down the road with Fed actions and money printing  delaying the inevitable consequences of our situation.  You are clueless about the damage that will happen to people and companies when the reality of our economic situation eventually catches up with us.  You are looking at a broken down trailer and calling it a mansion because you have no ability to properly assess the situation.  We are in the exact opposite of a strong economic situation.

No, not gold standard. Nobody said gold standard. There is a big difference between holding gold as an asset (which many countries already do including Japan, US, China, Russia, Greece, and just about everyone else) and price fixing some amount of your currency to some amount of gold which is what a gold standard is. I am specifically not talking of a gold standard. The fact you cant even think about gold except in the context of a gold standard shows you have a very limited view of these issues. I'm talking about a gold revaluation that improves the asset side of the balance sheet of countries that hold gold. Sovereign currency stays managed by sovereigns. Any global monetary change is likely to include the one unencumbered monetary asset held by most countries, and what do you think they will do with it? Lower its value? Reduce the asset side of their balance sheet when they are already drowning in debt and lack real assets? Think about it, a revaluation of one global asset that has no significant use except as a reserve asset fixes global debt problems overnight--it is staring everyone in the face (and it's why China and Russia started buying gold when they stopped buying US debt a few years back--they know where this is heading).

For one way to learn the "how", go watch the video mentioned near the top of this thread.  Here it is again if you can't find it:
Yes, oil price fell due to lessened demand.  The lack of demand results from the sudden reduction in money flooding the markets from QE ending and the resulting tip back into recession/depression.  This demand collapse is precisely what the money printing has been trying to stop all this time (though unfortunately all it does it delay the inevitable and cause wealth disparity).
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:06:41
I'll simply disagree with you on most your points.  Your view is very short term and backwards.  Yes for a few decades now countries have been on fiat and have printed or otherwise debased their fiat as part of their economic strategy however it has not lead to strong economies, it has destroyed their currencies and undermined their economies and social systems drastically.  All over the world and in every continent countries like Japan, the US, most the European countries, etc. are basically broke and on the brink of crisis.  You don't seem to understand the severity of the situation and as a result have a very different view than me.  You are wrong.  This will become clear over the next 10 years or so (probably starting with the collapse of the Japan yen that could happen literally at any time).
In the meantime I will again point you to a thousand years of fiat history and the decimation that has happened to literally hundreds of economies and currencies in that time from these sorts of fiat strategies.  You are apparently unaware of history and don't have an accurate view of the current situation either.  Hyperinflation is not rare, it is common.  Go to the PDF at the following link and go to appendix I starting at page 197 and see page after page of past currencies have died and how many due to hyperinflation or other currency failure.  Generally speaking fiat currencies have a very short lifespan.  All over the world fiat currency is in crisis right now (including in the US and Europe), you are just oblivious.

It's one guy's view on where bitcoin is going and unfortunately I think it's a bit confused and also unlikely. He says bitcoin will "replace the gold standard" which leads me to presume he's confused about gold as we're not even on a gold standard anymore. Maybe he's used them term "gold standard" loosely but regardless it's not clear what exactly he means by bitcoin replacing the gold standard. Gold is unlikely to go away... it's been around for thousands of years and is held in reserves across the world by banks and governments and will not become useless just because a form of digital gold came on the scene. Fiat is likely to be more effected than gold by bitcoin (particularly the dollar and its function as a global reserve  currency yet he doesn't mention this at all). How bitcoin effects fiat, gold, and global trade interaction will be interesting to see over the years but this videos conclusions are just too badly stated and defined to mean anything useful IMO, and he completely misses what is really likely to be shaken up by bitcoin.
Edit:  I like all the downvotes but nobody actually responding to the simple points I make.  I'd like to agree that it's a great explanation video, but sorry IMO it's not.

You are trapped in a little room of confusion because you have several wrong base assumptions.  Let me try to clear them up again.
First off I keep telling you I'm not talking about the gold standard.  Governments aren't prevented from devaluing their currency just because they hold remonetized gold as a sort of foreign reserve.  If they want to devalue their own currency nothing is stopping them.  Today they can't print foreign reserves either and it doesn't stop them from devaluing their own currencies.  Today if a government goes into excessive debt based on a foreign currency they don't control they also have no way to debase the debt--it would be the similar with gold in the picture.  
Secondly you seem to be under the delusion that governments can print and go into excessive debt under fiat without consequence.  A thousand years of fiat history and our current situation shows this is false.  There are still systemic problems they're just different.  People will soon rediscover this and demand change.
The final incorrect assumption you hold is you seem to think I'm advocating a certain direction we "should" be taking.  I'm really not.  I'm explaining where I think we are headed and that is not necessarily the same thing as where I think we should be heading.  
Because I'm aware of monetary history I'm aware that governments cycle from hard money to soft, from responsibility to corruption, from free markets to controlled, from rebirth to failure.  Unlike you I don't see fiat as some one true world system we're evolving but I also recognize gold isn't a solution either.  I have no delusions that there is some "solution" or "right answer" out there.  Humans suffer from human nature and stability breeds instability.  The trick, and what I'm trying to do, is determine where we are in the cycle, where we're going and plan accordingly.  Where we are is in the deflationary cycle of the Kondratiev wave, with aging and debt saturated global fiat, and a reserve currency that has started to be abandoned.  Where we go next is the question and it's what I'm trying to answer based on what I observe.
The reality is I don't know exactly where we're going (nobody does) but I'm pretty damn sure it's not a continuation of fiat and our current global monetary order.  Things are too far gone and fiat simply doesn't last that long.  Gold has been money for 5000 years and fiat has been cycling in and out for the last 1000.  That's great that you think something is now different this time and fiat will live forever but I think you're wrong (as should anyone who knows a little history and can take an objective view at what is going on in the world).

And it won't be long before they have to bring back QE or something worse because everything is going to head into the toilet again soon (probably by the end of the year). There is no recovery and won't ever be with the state we are in now, our debt based system has hit a debt saturation point and there is no exit. If they stop expanding the money supply it collapses in deflation (notice oil and other commodities falling like crazy since QE stopped?). .. if they keep rapidly expanding the money supply to keep things going we march toward devalued money and possible hyperinflation. Either way we are screwed and the system needs a reset via a global monetary change (which is likely to come in the next 5 years or so, just watch).

The world is slowly waking up to bitcoin's potential. But it will be slow going. This is the first step in a long journey.  The author of this article for example now probably sees a bit of bitcoin's potential but likely doesn't appreciate the issues with fiat money, debt-based money, and the current monetary system. It might literally take a failure of the current system (in their own country) before a significant number of people wake up to how bitcoin is more than a quicker and cheaper SWIFT or remittance system. It's difficult to be impressed by a solution to problems you don't even know exist.

Your argument that there is wealth and there can be creative redistribution of that wealth to address debt issues makes a little more sense than simply saying devaluation.  Devaluation doesn't help debt saturation.
I'd even add another possibility I consider more likely--there is a lot of historical/potential wealth, even in Greece.  Consider that many countries debt problems (including Japan, Italy, Greece, Spain, US, etc.) can go away literally overnight merely by revaluing gold to again be a monetary asset with a value that properly reflects the increase in global currency/debt expansion since it was demonetized decades ago.  IMO the only reason this hasn't already happened is the US isn't ready to give back the dollar's reserve status to gold just yet.  But lately the dollar's position is already coming into question anyway.
IMO that's where these global debt issues will inevitably end up.  All the countries in the below link are sitting on large amounts of gold and that gold is not valued the way it used to be.  As an "obsolete" reserve asset gold is valued absurdly low today--the largest gold reserves in the world are in the US and yet valued in dollars those represent only a few months of QE printing.  But as gold's value is essentially arbitrary it can be revalued to whatever global players choose without significant impact to global economies.  This is the next step for gold and the current monetary system that some people (including me) expect to happen in the next 10 years or so...  a rapid gold revaluation back to levels more closely related to the trillions in debt and fiat created over the last 40 years.  It would give all the below countries a huge boost in real assets and solve their debt issues overnight.  The only question is if it happens by design and surprise announcement or if it happens as the natural result of some horrible global crisis.  This is also discussed in the previously mentioned book "The Big Reset."

You're thinking like a trader not like a government.  
There are trillions in foreign reserves used in daily monetary management by world governments that dwarfs the gold market.  Gold being demonetized means governments are not really buying and using gold anymore as a storage and tracking mechanism in monetary management.  In fact they have arguably been selling gold and suppressing its price for decades.  All this is a choice.  As a result of that choice the gold market is now tiny by comparison to what it used to be relative to the monetary values governments deal with on a daily basis.  Governments hold gold reserves that are large from the standpoint of amount of existing gold but very small from the standpoint of global monetary value.  
Gold being remonetized means governments would again use gold in monetary management.  They would buy gold and use it as a storage mechanism for the trillions in fiat value that they deal with on a daily basis.  This means gold would have to increase dramatically in value to hold the sort of value governments would be putting into it.  If a group of governments decided to they could set the gold market to whatever value was useful to them merely by buying and using gold again.  The process of buying trillions in gold would raise the price of gold to be able to hold the required value--that's what gold does (as does bitcoin by the way).  This would not necessarily be a peg but would result merely by the decision to once again recognize gold's usefulness and buy/use it in the role of monetary management.  That would also be a mere choice and could change the value of gold by orders of magnitude overnight.
The question of why they would do that is a better question than if they could do it.  They could certainly do it.  Why they might do it I already gave one explanation...  debt troubles for many counties would go away overnight as existing gold reserves would suddenly be revalued to have a real relationship again with existing global monetary values and debts.  Another reason you might not accept (as you somehow think fiat is succeeding when I see it as failing) but IMO there is a fundamental problem with the current system and its instability in that there is no way to actually extinguish debt as there was before 1971 with gold. The only objective aspect of the monetary system is gold, fiat is subjective and controlled by governments and cannot be the basis of any honest value exchange between countries.  You will probably reject this but all this will be understood better as the existing system continues to fall apart.
Additionally there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence for gold coming back into play in the near future.  I recommend you read that book I've referenced a few times now...  it's not a great book but it's a single place that rapidly covers a large number of the issues happening in the world around gold that I've been following for years and that have led me to believe what I do.  Without that background it's all just unfounded supposition as I'm sure you see it.

The debt and money printing is not a separate issue, they are THE issue. If they didn't add those new trillions into the GDP calculation it would be falling like a rock. It's a hell of a situation when you can only get "growth" by borrowing and printing it. As it is we already pay more in interest on the debt than we do on our military, and that's at these crazy low interest rates (and the debt keeps increasing at increasing rates). We're way past unsustainable, we're at "next stop, failure town."

It could happen a number of ways. One way, the way most countries would prefer to avoid, is naturally as a result of global monetary crisis possibly brought on by a yen collapse and the market's subsequent recognition of the risks of fiat and  gold as a natural monetary commody with no counterparty risk and a resulting flow of value into gold as a safe and historical resevoir of global monetary value. Gold would be revalued simply by rational market behaviors when it is once again recognized as the default store of value over dollars and other fiat now being used. This would also involve a bunch of related side effects you also won't believe right now like a collapse of gold futures markets and other paper/derivative gold markets. 
Another way is by agreement between a number of countries, perhaps as the introduction of an SDR-like global asset that includes gold with a basket of currencies that simply recognizes gold as a remonetized asset with significantly higher value. Those countries will pay the higher price for gold as will the rest of the market very rapidly. 
There are other possibilities as well but the key is recognition of the nature and historical use of gold.  Again gold is a mostly useless metal whose purpose is to be a ledger of value, a money. Like bitcoin it's value is arbitrary and is a reflection of the needs of the market that uses it. Once it is used again (monetized) by countries at the level of trillions it will take on the value required of it (and quite likely become the basis of value which turns a lot of things on their heads from our limited fiat perspective). This can happen naturally as in the first possibility above or by design as in the second possibility.  Most people don't realize this is the nature of gold (and bitcoin).

Stop thinking the time to "use" bitcoin is now--it's not. Stores will be willing to take it as there are many incentives but IMO if you're in bitcoin now you should be tech savvy with a primary focus on holding (using and expanding  the value store function, which will also be the quickest way to further adoption, development, and value expansion, again IMO).
I personally don't think bitcoin's future is to be some consumer payment network anyway. Bitcoin came into being in a very unique time... a time when consumer payment networks are trivial and ubiquitous, as are  currencies. But portable, anonymous, secure, monetary assets that are no one else's liability and cannot easily be confiscated or debased did not even exist in any practical sense. It's just that most people don't even know what such things are or why they would want them... yet. So people get all hung up on trying to make bitcoin into another paypal for grandma... but bitcoin has a bigger role to play than that. Grandma will have about as much use for bitcoin as she would an invisible bar of gold. Those that will discover they have use for invisible gold have a lot more money than grandma.

The US already has the largest gold position of all countries (for the moment) and is already in the prime position with the dollar as reserve currency.  It will not be good for the US for another money to take the dollar's place and so the US will (initially) fight against all uses of gold just as it has for decades.  Note that the US also has physical control of a lot of foreign gold, though that is rapidly changing as countries are moving to repatriate their gold (and why are they doing that?).
Other countries that are accumulating, Russia and China for instance, are accumulating gold VERY rapidly by historical standards but are doing so to not effect price as that would not be helpful to their long term goals of accumulating as much as possible before a monetary reset.  Also realize the entire point of remonetizing gold is because it's priced incredibly low by historical standards considering how much fait/debt has been created since it was demonetized.  Price now is irrelevant for a country, what matters is how much you have *relative to everyone else* as that defines how much value you gain after a reset.  You don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the other guy.
At some point near or at a reset there likely could be a rush into gold.  There certainly would be after some surprise announcement with implications for gold.  By definition most people and countries will not see this coming because if they had gold would have already shot up in value significantly and futures markets gone force majeure.  it's because most people know nothing about money (and even less about gold) and think like you do about gold that they will be caught off guard just as they have every other time through history during big monetary changes.
This isn't about inflation, this is about remonetization, so gold's performance as an inflation hedge is not relevant.  Inflation is a red herring anyway, governments don't care about that (they are causing it!)--gold's function as a global long term store of value with no 3rd party risk is unmatched by anything else and is what it excels at.

The issue is dollars are what is being inflated away.  Yes you could pay someone in gold, silver, fairy dust or whatever if what you paid them in had real value rather that wasn't depreciating over time.  Then there wouldn't be an issue of their real wages falling over time to complain about.  (Yen has the same problem as dollars).
As for the stability of the currency not mattering, you are wrong.  Wages have not kept up with inflation.  That would not happen if there wasn't inflation of the currency in the first place.

Actually some bitcoin third parties do have   insurance against loss (e.g. coinbase), and no doubt more will be coming as bitcoin goes mainstream.  The issue I was talking about is a problem with smaller exchanges that have no such insurance. 
No doubt there are places out there that will hold your gold and not be insured and you'd be a fool to use them. And yet people send their bitcoins into these little exchanges every day...

That is completely wrong.  The military doesn't back the economic system, the economic system backs the military.  The military doesn't come first, economic strength does. You are putting the cart before the horse because it's convenient to imagine the military strength of the US keeps us economically strong when it's not true.  Debt management is more important than bombs.  Rational spending is more important important not armies.  I guarantee you as the US economy continues to decline due to too much debt, and too much spending (including military), when the checks to the military can no longer be paid with good money the military will disband or move on to some power that can pay them.

A significant number of gold holders have little interest in transferring gold.  Gold is a generational wealth store.  You don't normally transfer it, you hold it and pass it down to your heirs like you would property, or anything else that is a core holding of your estate.  It's portable in very rare cases when needed but generally you care more that it holds its value over time and never deteriorates.

That's the common claim but it's not true.  Nobody stops buying things because their saving increase in value.  Do you never buy a computer or phone because it will be cheaper next month?  Of course not, when you eventually need something you buy it.
The reality is the manipulated interest rates from the Fed are what are causing people to stop buying stuff.  You've got all these boomers who are either retired or nearing retirement and they must live off their savings.  When their savings are returning 5% they can spend that 5%.  When their savings are returning 0.25% like today due to artificial interest rates they have almost no earnings coming in and have to spend their savings rather than their earnings.  They won't tend to spend their savings, so they hold back on purchases.  The Fed is causing the economy to enter a deflationary collapse, not preventing it...  falling oil prices and collapsing shipments is just the start.

I appreciate that changing the value of currency doesn't increase the value of labor.  I'm not talking about increasing the value of labor, I'm talking about being paid steady value over time.  You don't hold the value of payment steady over time by robbing value from the currency (and the economy) and failing to properly account for that stolen value.  You're blaming productivity but all that does is change the nature of labor done for minimum wage over time.  The pay itself should not change if it is adjusted for inflation as politicians claim.  The reality is ALL labor has been devalued by the misreporting of inflation, I'm just using minimum wage as the example as it's easy to point to as it has a known fixed value associated with it.
The issue is even broader.  The US middle class is vanishing, jobs are vanishing, wages are falling, businesses are vanishing.  What is your explanation for the decline of the US economy?

Real wages have been falling and that is directly a factor of inflation as I've been describing.  Real household wealth is also falling, that is also partly due to inflation.  Businesses are now dying at a faster rate than new businesses are being created for the first time in US history (and employment is in a secular decline as a result), this is all related to the debts and economic situation that also are related to our inflationary debt-based system.  Everything is tied together and at the heart is fiat causing this whole mess.
It's true that deflation hurts those that are in debt but it didn't used to be that the poorer you are the more likely you are to have debts.  It used to be nobody would lend the poor money.  A few decades ago credit cards were a sign of affluence as only the rich could get them.  Now most everyone is in debt, and especially the government.  The entire monetary system runs on debt and is likely to collapse in a deflation.  it is a bad situation now as there is too much debt all around.  That's why I think the way ahead has a big sign on it that reads "Default" and likely failure of the current monetary system, but that's another story.

Huh?  I'm not talking about UFOs or BigFoot.  Fiat always dies, usually in a few decades and and often in a hyperinflation.  This isn't conspiracy theory, it's simple observable fact.  [There are have been dozens of such failures over the last few decades.](  [U.S. history of money even has its share.](  Fiat doesn't last long and studies show what economic situations lead to failures of fiat.  It might be difficult to believe it could happen here because you've lived a cozy life so far without such a failure, but if you think it will never happen (especially with what we're doing to ourselves economically) you're living in denial.

I'm talking about short term trading.  Short term traders are not investing...  they don't get value from the asset they are buying, they are trying to capture gains from short-term price movement of the asset.  They basically take money in a zero sum game from other traders similar to how poker players make gains from other players.  However since there is also an exchange to pay fees to it's not even a zero sum game...  as a result the majority of traders lose money while the exchanges make money and a very few traders profit.  It's NOT investing--with investing the majority of people can profit because gains are made from the gains of the asset.  With trading it's more like playing in a poker game with a rake, and by its very structure the majority will lose money.  Short term trading is a losing game (except for the exchanges).

Short term trading is a losing game period (unless you're an exchange).  You trade win/losses with other traders while the exchange takes profits from everyone.  The more you trade the more money flows to the exchange and away from those participating, exactly like playing poker with a rake.
If you're very good or lucky you might be the profitable poker player at the table for the night, but in general it's a losing game to try to play long term.

B.S. The exchanges could be shut down tomorrow (and might be) and bitcoin would do just fine. Speculation is not synonymous with trading and exchanges.

Minimum wage in 1964 was $1.50/hour. If you take $1.50 in US change minted in 1964 (which was silver by the way and dollars were backed by gold), that exact same change today is worth $21.60 in todays money from the silver as the silver has held its value compared to the dollar.  So $21.60/hour vs $7.25 for min wage today gives you a taste of what has been lost by inflation and the manipulation of inflation numbers since then. And our min wage is supposedly been adjusted for inflation.

Yes, I'm serious.  No fiat currency in history has survived more than a few generations.  Most no more than a few decades.  Note that the names of a fiat might continue on, but the currency itself has significantly changed.  For example the dollar has been around a while but it's only been pure fiat since the 70's when they globally defaulted on its gold backing.  So the fiat US dollar has only existed for around 40 years.  If this is news to you I suggest you shouldn't be talking about things you know nothing about.

"There are, however, two ways to incorporate the IMF's regime into Bitcoin. The first option is to grant Bitcoin indirect control over the IMF.

Mining is systemically required, it validates transactions and the effort required assures trust.  Trading is a zero sum game, a bunch of dumbasses sitting around trying to capture money from each other (and the community!) without providing any value themselves.  Even in the best case they are parasites on the market and lately in the mainstream markets it's gotten to the point where "trading" has turned into outright theft (e.g. LIBOR rigging).  Historically when a society starts focusing on speculation it's a sign of a failing social and economic fabric.  Trading is not something to be admired or emulated, it's a parasitic activity to be scorned and shunned.  
The ironic thing is I KNOW I've already done better than the vast majority of "traders" by simply buying and having conviction in my purchase.  Traders don't believe in the purchase, they only look for money moving around.  I am not effected by mtgox "lag" and anyone who is, is most likely a parasite.  Fuck them, let them go find a more liquid market to be a parasite on.
Fuck MtGox too--It would be better for the rest of the bitcoin community if all "trades" required 10 minutes to confirm just like ordinary transactions.  There is no real reason for rapid trading beyond helping the parasites.  We gain nothing from a platform allowing millions of pointless high frequency exchanges by bots and gambling addicts.

I think you'll be ok if the price of bitcoins drops below your buy price at some point so coinbase can buy your coins for the transaction at a discount.  They would only need to cancel if prices went up continuously for a week and never came down so they could never buy.  This is speculation but maybe that's why their transactions are so cheap?

Long term I think very few traders are profitable due to the cut taken from exchanges.  Some are...  though probably less than 1%.   Shorter term more can be profitable, but the number drops the longer time period you go out.   And at all time periods more traders lose than win (with losers increasing the more time and trades pass, just like with gambling), so it's not a game with winning odds.  
But if you think you can do it, go right ahead.  But I know from experience I will do better than you and 95% of other traders in bitcoin simply by doing nothing.  Think about that next time you're stressing over a trade.

You are flat wrong. I care less about the anonymity of bitcoin than I do it's structure that makes it act like digital gold.

This idea gets floated every few weeks but it's kinda blah. Nobody wants a "milli-bitcoin," they want a bitcoin. And most wallets and websites already support setting mBTC already anyway.
**It would do more to call it a "split" and do it 10:1 like they split stock.** One day suddenly everyone has 10x more bitcoin but value falls by 10. Bitcoin is suddenly cheaper and you have more of them, both things people love.  Really is just like getting 10 dimes for a dollar but people love it when a stock splits and more than a few think they're getting something for nothing.  Internally it's just a name change of a decimal shift but it's done internally rather than trying to get people to change. And having 10x more bitcoin quiets people who think 21 million isn't enough.

It doesn't take any more regulation for insurance than already exists.  You can insure almost anything, it's just a matter of businesses being setup.
I disagree insuring coins in some wallet will mean transactions can't be fast, easy and anonymous.  Insured wallets might not be anonymous, but the network itself still would be.  Then if you want privacy don't use an insured wallet.

I have some litecoin but it hasn't gone much of anywhere in relation to bitcoin.  Meaning, as bitcoin goes up it goes up too, but I haven't made any more than I would've if I held bitcoin.  If it survives it will always be some small fraction of bitcoin.  If you want to buy it pay attention to the ratio of LTC/BTC and buy when the ratio gets lower than normal and consider selling when it gets higher than normal.  In other words to me litecoin is more of a trade than an investment and I'm not as interested in it as bitcoin.  People mine litecoin as a way to get more bitcoin--that should tell you something.

Yep, transactions on exchanges are internal to the exchange and not on the blockchain. 
Also when your coins are held by someone else like an exchange,  you're reliant on that someone else to be secure and not have your coins lost or stolen (which has happened multiple times in the past).  Exchanges are not what bitcoin is about in my opinion. They are where government control will come down also if control comes down. You could wake up one day and the government has shut your exchange and taken your coins. That happened  to Americans with money in some poker sites a few years ago and I lost a lot of trust after that. They just came in, closed the sites and stole people's money. It could happen with bitcoin too. So I just avoid exchanges as much as possible.

Yes, they should give it to us.  We bore the risk of taking the loss if the prices fell, we get the gains when the prices rise.  You don't get to cancel the transaction after the gains have been made and walk away with the gains when *I* was the one bearing the risk of downside.

Thanks for the information Fred.   Can you comment on the issues I bring up in the original post?  
Are bitcoins bought when the transaction is first made and if so then what happened to the unrealized gains on our canceled transactions?  Did coinbase pocket those gains?  Is that reasonable?  
If coins aren't bought until a week later when the transaction completes how do you handle your exposure to price change risk during the transaction waiting period?  
Is there something else that happens that I don't understand and if so can you explain it?  Thanks in advance.

The government/banks have a lot of experience manipulating markets.  They are openly doing it full time right now via the Fed in the bond markets and indirectly in the stock markets.  Why hassle the public when they can go right to the bitcoin market--people will leave when the market fails or becomes too volatile.
They don't need tools like naked shorting either, they use what they have.  The government is already deep in cyber-warfare...  if they don't already have bitcoins they use cyber-warfare assets to hack an exchange to get bitcoins to sell to crash the market then after the bitcoin price has crashed to pocket change they buy a large part of the market to have coins to control it in the future.  Oh wait, the exchange hack and market crash *already happened*... but that couldn't have been the government, right?  Right?

Yes, there is a COST associated with mining bitcoins.  But that does not directly add to the VALUE of bitcoin.  Go spend a lot of money and dig up some rocks that are down deep...  do the rocks have value simply because you spent money to get them?

The supposed benefit of "liquidity" is overstated.  It's the only supposed benefit traders and exchanges can point to for the nonproductive nonsense they spend their time doing so they never shut up about it, and so finding anyone who hasn't heard about it is difficult.
The liquidity bitcoin needs comes from people USING it, not robots trading it back-and-forth with each other for fiat all day on exchanges.  Nobody benefits from trading except the exchanges taking percentages from everyone and the small minority of traders that manage to make a profit over exchange fees at the expense of the vast majority of traders.

The purpose of taxes when money was commodity backed was to fund government.  Now that government has full control of money taxes have a very different purpose.
I never said things couldn't turn around or that government was inherently bad.  I just don't think things will turn around because the path of least resistance politically is to keep printing until its too late.  Government is good when the people are in control and the government is working for the people.  Unfortunately when government takes control of money from the people it tends to go downhill fast from there.  It's becoming more and more difficult to look at the NSA stuff or any of the news happening and say the government is working for the people.
I can't say that I'm any particular label of political philosophy.  I'm practically minded as an engineer and look for practical facts and reality (which are tough to find in economics) while avoiding labels that tend to box me in.  I don't think bitcoin will obliterate government, I think government is obliterating fiat and bitcoin is an outgrowth of that happening.  Government isn't going anywhere, but fiat is dying (as it always has through history).  What exactly that is going to look like I don't know, but we'll eventually find out.  In the meantime bitcoin is a nice shelter from the fireworks yet to come.

You keep thinking I'm pushing gold or clinging to it.  I'm not.  I'm using the history of gold to help explain things about bitcoin. You apparently have such a personal problem with gold that you can't even stand to hear someone discuss how its history applies to bitcoin.  You might let up on whatever your personal problem is with gold considering bitcoin was modeled after gold.  It's basically digital gold!  The more you know about gold and its history the better you'll understand bitcoin and where it might be headed and what problems it might face.  The reason why I got into bitcoin as early as I did is because I understood bitcoin because I understood gold and the history of gold.

You're overlooking one little fact:  the only real exit from alt-coins is into bitcoin.  When the bottom falls out on the alt-coin bubble, money will rapidly rush into bitcoin as that's where it flows easiest (and really most of those in alt-coins have really just been looking to get more bitcoins all along anyway).  The underlying confidence is in bitcoin not in a bunch of alt-coins that have no infrastructure and no actual users.  But you're right, market confidence is a fragile thing, when it goes for the alt-coins it could be very ugly very fast for the alts.

Wall street makes money off traders and selling products to investers--they are the house collecting profits off you gamblers. Hedge funds have underperformed the indexes for several years now, and still idiots pay them huge fees for doing worse than an index. It's not like on TV where wall street is presented as traders... wall street is the guys taking money from traders. Who do you think makes all these ETFs that collext fees and structures all these markets you pay into?  Who takes a percentage of your mutual funds and 401k to do nothing but underperform the market more often than not? That's what wall street really is.
The few successful traders on wall street are the cheats who manipulate LIBOR for profits and don't go to jail. Or big houses that manipulate markets around to make money at others expense. They are successful because they CHEAT. But mostly wall street is about fees and percentages and financial products, not trading. They know trading is a losers game--they run the game.

It does matter, it's the entire point of the discussion--the eventual failure of the fiat dollar.  It's why bitcoin was created in the first place. When a currency no longer has any value but the value of an authority it tends to fail within a few decades.  No such currency has lasted more than around 100 years with the exception of roman currency and that was a special case as it was silver based but they slowly debased the amount of silver over a long period of time until the currency was merely fiat (and then it failed).  If you want to believe the dollar is the singular exception to all of monetary history I think you are wrong.  We can even know at what point the dollar is likely to fail based on examining past failures and government debt/deficit levels at those times.

I think you are confused. When you buy a share of a commodity ETF you don't get the commodity, you get a claim to the commodity in the form of an ETF share. You can tell the difference between a bitcoin and an ETF share to a bitcoin, right? One is a bitcoin and one is a claim to a bitcoin. One is managed on the blockchain and one is managed in a centralized wall street exchange. One is a decentralized deflationary currency, the other is a centralized claim on an underlying asset (and has a management fee associated with it and complex rules associating it to the underlying asset through many 3rd parties).

People unaware of monetary history usually won't see a problem, but the problem is there.  Consider gold and the gold standard for a moment--bitcoin is very much like digital gold.  Gold was honest money for thousands of years but that broke down and we no longer have honest money.  Gold still exists, nobody "hacked" gold, so how did that break down happen?  Once you figure that out apply the same thinking to bitcoin, because bitcoin might take a similar path and become "managed" such that it becomes irrelevant just like gold.  And that path is paved with bankers and has a sign post saying Wall Street.

The bottom line is HFT is not about making normal, lawful, trade orders like other responsible agents in a market.  It is about illegally manipulating the other agents of the market, security price and order book to drive order volume in ways that create jams, volatility, pricing gaps between exchanges, or other patterns that can be exploited for profit by the scum running these algos.  This is highly unethical and anti-social even if it wasn't illegal, which it is (see my other post).
Bitcoin exchanges are not regulated and so such price manipulation is not illegal there which is why I suggest the exchanges crack down on it themselves.  However it's obviously very immoral, detrimental to the exchange and to agents on the exchange, as well as generally illegal on regulated exchanges.  That people like you actually argue for it is disturbing and I chalk it up to plain ignorance rather than malice.

Good for you.  On the other side of your trades others lost what you gained AND the exchange took a cut from both of you.  So overall more money was lost than what you gained.  It's a losing game.  If you're winning, congrats but most will lose.  And the longer you play the more goes to the exchange and the higher your odds of losing.

I suspect there is knowledge to be gained based on knowing how TrueCrypt structures its files coupled with comparing versions over time.  In particular you might be able to discover if the headers change such that you can know if a hidden volume is in use or not and that is not something you want to be public information.  Whether there is more information to be gained over time or not I'm not sure, but I still don't trust it.  A TrueCrypt volume file should appear as random numbers to anyone examining it, but if you have history you see certain locations changing to new values and other locations remaining static over time.  Couple that with some knowledge or reasonable guesses for what portions of the plaintext should be (again the TrueCrypt owned system areas), then that is information I wouldn't put past experts to be able to use to help break the file.  
Sorry that your word that it doesn't matter doesn't reassure me, but it doesn't.  You can't give someone multiple versions of a file (with known system areas) that has slightly changed over time all encrypted with the same password and expect security has not degraded.
*Edit:  
See the comment from "Crypto" at the following page.  He seems to claim TrueCrypt is not secure with DropBox versioning...  something about the volume key becoming discoverable:*

Bitcoin is an odd case.  If bitcoin will eventually succeed then they are very undervalued.  If bitcoin will eventually fail then they will probably be a total loss.  Eventual success or failure of bitcoin is an unknown.  So bitcoin as an investment is sort of like a lottery ticket--it either wins big or it becomes worthless.  If you are aware of that all the rest is noise.  Yes there are views against bitcoin and it might fail, but so what?  Does that change anything?  Bitcoin might fail, but it also might succeed.  It makes no sense to try to "average" views on bitcoin to come up with some middle ground because bitcoin's success/failure is very binary.
Due to this binary expectation, one way to value bitcoin is probability of success times estimated value of bitcoin after success.  So suppose you give bitcoin a 10% chance of success and a 90% chance of failure, but you expect bitcoin to be worth $100,000/btc if it succeeds.  Then bitcoin has a value of 0.1 * $100,000 or $10,000 even adjusted for a 90% chance of complete failure.  **Even a 99% chance of eventual failure values bitcoin at $1000 today (assuming it could hit $100,000 if it succeeds).**  Is that single-minded bullishness?  Or is it calculated bullishness? Is this view dependent on me considering any particular argument against bitcoin or does it just accept there are many possible modes of failure and generally includes them in the calculation?
What people need to guard against is being chased off a good bet by improperly valuing/weighing possible failure.  They also should guard against putting too much into a "lottery style" bet, even a good one.

It's absurd to open derivative trading on an underlying that is small like bitcoin. It just encourages large traders to shove bitcoin price around to game the binary options.

You're an idiot to trade those options if you can't move bitcoin price... because for sure the guy on the other side of the trade can. And even if you can move bitcoin price you better hope the other guy can't move it better than you.

U.S. is run by banks and will not adopt bitcoin; it's likely to do a similar thing as China.  Bitcoin has to learn to thrive despite government attempts to stop it.  And actually all it has to do is survive for a while longer until it becomes more obvious to everyone that fiat is dying.  The theme song to that will be ever increasing capital controls (which bitcoin should be able to get around).  Once interest rates and government deficits rise the dollar will head right back into failure mode and this time will get a lot farther down that road.  
Noobs that got on for price speculation probably didn't realize they were getting on a lifeboat from fiat failure and a monetary revolution, but they'll learn fast when the time comes.

Bitcoin might one day fail, but it won't be for the reasons fiat fails.
As for the dollar, it will continue its decline (it's lost 85% of its value in my lifetime alone so far, so it's arguably already failed).  And likely within 20 years (possibly sooner, especially given the printing currently going on) it will suffer a significant collapse in a very short period of time and be replaced with something else.  To doubt that is to deny all of monetary history (of which you are probably ignorant).

An HFT bot doesn't add real liquidity, it floods the system with many little orders in order to jam up the system and cause pricing artifacts that can create arbitrage profit opportunities that can be taken advantage of on other exchanges (for one example).  Within one exchange they slam the system in order to see how it effects the order book...  looking for patterns that can be taken advantage of.  They exist specifically to CAUSE traffic jams/accidents that can be exploited for profit.  It's disgusting and should not be tolerated by the responsible agents on the exchange.
On wall street where orders can be canceled the HFT algos often cancel the thousands of orders they create before they can be acted on...  you think a thousand little orders that get canceled the second anyone tries to act on them adds liquidity?  Wake up.  These are exchange exploits, not valid liquidity adding agents.

I think it is due to the price gains. There are delays between the price they give you and the execution... I think if the price rises to far too fast they cancel your order and tell you good luck next time while blaming you for being an unspecified bad risk.

And as soon as the pattern is noticed and you start to make money off it, it will change and you'll lose more than you made to begin with.   Stop.  Just stop.  
Buy bitcoins.  Give bitcoins time to come into their own and profit.  Odds are if you trade then months from now you (and most other "traders") will wonder why you haven't made as much as just buying and holding.  You'll also get caught up in all the drama of the exchanges, and being locked out and unable to buy/sell at the worst times, etc.  By trading you're playing a losing game similar to satashi dice...  traders play around in a zero sum game while the exchange takes profits from everyone.  Add it up and you lose a few percent over time just like with dice.  Don't play.

The speed of moving fiat and bitcoin on an exchange are similar.  In both cases clearing of trades is done by a central exchange.  The problem with bitcoin is its exchanges are a lot smaller and less mature than the large fiat exchanges.
It's important to note that all this MtGox crap has nothing to do with bitcoin and its transaction system of the blockchain.  It's not bitcoin itself having these issues, it's the exchanges and their trading problems, lag, pricing of bitcoin in fiat, etc.

Bitcoins get their value similarly as gold--from their usefulness as a store of value and method for value exchange.

There were swings of inflation/deflation caused by banks expanding/contracting the money supply with fractional reserve (a whole other issue) but the money itself didn't change.  You're going to blame an honest money system for the sins of fractional reserve banking?
I agree for short periods of time (relatively speaking) our  centrally managed economy might appear to have better employment figures and smaller economic boom/bust swings.  However what is happening is growth of debt and deficit leading to a total failure of the currency (to say nothing of the corruption of the financial system and government and gutting of the middle class).  You think you have a high degree of accuracy in future planning but the complete collapse of the dollar will throw a huge wrench into that illusion even as it spreads incredibly misery over the entire country.  
You probably won't believe the collapse end game, but it's happening right now and you have front row seats.  Debt is already at failure levels, all we need is budget deficit heading over 40% of government spending (and that will happen probably within the next 10 years--it nearly happened in 2008/2009).  I'd suggest you start making plans but you're already in the bitcoin forum so you're on the right track.

Some of us were charged and some weren't, but it's beside the point.  I was promised coins at a particular price.  You can bet if bitcoin prices fell I'd have been charged and the coins would be in my account.  However prices shot up, so the order was mysteriously canceled.  So how does coinbase work?  Are they stealing gains or are they open to unlimited losses?  Read the original post and understand it.

I'm only talking about setting up brainwallets or paperwallets securely and the client isn't needed for that.  Once the brainwallets are setup securely and the private keys are archived (mentally or physically) they won't be needed--you can restart in your primary operating system with internet connected and use the client or coinbase to transfer your coins into the public addresses of the wallets you generated offline.

Well then if you're just saying a bubble is when price gets ahead of itself and later falls then I agree bitcoin will go through that (and already has several times).

Bitcoin is not that sort of bubble.

Stop loss orders add to market volatility.  And they often don't work out as the trader intended.  With stop loss orders you tend to get price runs in big sharp spikes down that "run the stops" then the price bounces right back up leaving people with stop loss orders having executed at the worst price of the month.

Except this is what would've really happened:
Guy 1: puts his coins in an exchange and starts trading.  He loses half to trading and the rest when the exchange has all their coins stolen.
Guy 2: puts his coins in mining.  By the time his miners arrive its no longer worthwhile to mine and he never even recovers the dollar cost of the miners let alone the now greatly increased value of the bitcoins used to buy the miners.  Basically a total loss.
Guy 2 (alternate): puts his coins in mining shares.  Loses all value as it was a scam and/or the exchange closed down on him and his investment vanished.  
Guy 3:  Held his bitcoins securely in a paper wallet.  In one year made 5000%.
@_date: 2013-03-03 02:53:57
That makes no sense.  Why would bitcoins need to be deposited in a "bank" in the first place if they are just going to remain in the bank?  Just leave them in your wallet--they're just as safe there.  The point of a bank is your deposits are loaned out to make interest (which requires your coins to not be in the bank).

It's nice if bitcoin can enter/exit from fiat easily.  It's debatable if bitcoin "needs" that though.  Bitcoin can quite easily be used as a store of value and medium of exchange for real product/services without ever being converted to other currencies--just buy something for bitcoin or sell something for bitcoin.  If governments start attacking bitcoin it might be difficult to exchange for fiat and exchange for real things (and cash face-to-face) might be how it is mostly used.  Traders staring at charts all day might forget what currencies are really for, but some others of us haven't.

Coinbase is for buying and selling bitcoins for personal use, not for trading bitcoins (and especially not for day-trading).  You are buying bitcoins from coinbase and there are waits and restrictions.  If you want to trade, get an account at an exchange (e.g. MtGox) where you buy and sell with other traders.  
Though my advice is don't trade.  Buy because you know what you're buying and you're in for the long term.  Most people who trade will lose money and will regret ever opening a trading account.

You don't have to wait for any confirmations to see that a transaction was made and how much it was.  That happens basically instantly on the bitcoin network.  Confirmations are miners adding transactions to the blockchain.  You don't have to wait for confirmations if you don't mind taking the tiny risk that someone might try to double spend.

I concur.  Next year will see bitcoin popping up on more and more check-out web forms. This will drive another 10x growth move but that will be the last of the huge price move years. Expect much smaller moves from 2015 onwards as the speculative pricing of 2013 through 2014 will have priced in most of the real growth gains still to come. 
 Tl;dr It's going up 10x next year but this is your last chance for gains of that magnitude that quickly.

This will be a very painful lesson for MOST traders when they calculate how much they would've had if they had just bought and held vs. trying to trade.
When you short term trade it's a negative expectation game as there are traders on each side of the exchange trying to profit from each other plus the exchange itself taking a cut from both sides.  So over time only the exchange is sure to make a profit.  Think about it--the earlier you stop trading the more you'll save yourself.

After you've changed your password and moved all your coins to a new address take some steps to secure how you access your coins.  If you're on Windows make a linux live cd (google linux live cd) and boot into that to do your bitcoin transactions then boot back into Windows when done.  Don't do bitcoin transactions in Windows, period!  The session from a linux live cd boot doesn't store its state to disk and so you'll always have a clean OS free of viruses and keyloggers when you access your bitcoins.  It's easy to make a live cd and it only takes a few minutes to boot into a clean OS to do your bitcoin transactions--the security advantage is totally worth it.  Use the live cd for your online banking too.  Having security software and firewalls is not enough these days in Windows IMO.

I agree governments are the biggest threat.  But they don't have to take action in a way that drives it underground.  They could manipulate the price, crash the price, and drive interest away.

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:46:26

The dollar used to be backed by gold (the backing of which was removed over time) and is running on the tradition of that backing.  It also gets value from the fact it is required to pay taxes in and this creates demand for it (this is actually the real reason for taxes).  You can bet if the market had a free choice it would not choose a money whose value is based in one region/country and whose value gets drained on an ongoing basis into banks/government in ever increasing amounts (in the trillions lately due to the bailouts).

This kind of volatility is fun for day traders but isn't conducive to merchants using bitcoin as a basis of exchange.  Can you imagine trying to run a business where your trade currency moves 100% in a month and +-20% in a day?  I don't think so.  You'd have to run hedges on the currency itself and who needs that on top of whatever business it is you're trying to run.

Why do we care if China is paid with devalued dollars?  Our requirement is to pay them dollars.  If they want gold, higher interest rates, or something else they borrow with those sorts of payments in the contract.
Selling our gold to play dollar debts is stupid and not even what is specified in the contracts.  There is no requirement to pay dollar debts in gold, only in dollars.  Once gold is gone, it's gone, so why would we want to use it for loans made in funny money?
The goal has never been to pay as much of the debt as possible.  The goal is to manage the debt.  Why would you want to stop loans for expensive dollars today that you get to pay off with devalued dollars tomorrow as long as creditors allow it?  As long as creditors accept such a ridiculous game, they get what they deserve.

If you think it's a lousy plan, don't do it.  But if you examine the possible outcomes of a diversified plan vs. a high-risk high-reward plan, the diversified plan gives many outcomes of small positive returns and really no outcomes of outsized returns.  If you want outsized returns you simply can't get there by diversification.  So it really boils down to what you want.  Most of the very rich didn't get there by diversification, they got there by taking risks for outsized returns at some point.

I wouldn't waste my time mining.  It's very difficult to do profitably even when you know what you're doing.  It will cost you less to simply buy bitcoins.
However to answer your question about faster blockchain downloads:
* Quit and restart the program a few times and watch the speed of the download.  Each time you connect you'll get random nodes you connect to and some are faster than others.  Eventually you'll get a faster download.
* Download the bitcoin blockchain from a torrent file (google to find one).
* If you just want a fast wallet use the Electrum Wallet instead.  It doesn't require a download of the blockchain and has some cool features too.  This won't help you mine, but then mining isn't really profitable anymore for most people.

3) No way.  If you could find the controlling private key for any arbitrary "wrong" address to "claim" it then bitcoin would have no security and couldn't work.  If you didn't create the address and thus know its private key, you can't control it, period.

When you buy a share of the ETF do you get an address to bitcoins?  No.  You get a share which represents a claim to bitcoins through some complex ETF which has some zillion pages of rules about how and when those claims might or might not get turned into bitcoins.  Also in those pages is the management FEE you get charged for the "service" of having these guys sell you claims to bitcoins and manage it all through their centralized exchanges.  They are selling you claims to bitcoins that under most circumstances  liquidate back to dollars and never bitcoins.  Options on those ETFs get even more crazy.  The whole thing basically lets them hold their bitcoins AND make money off them by selling you a piece of paper while charging you for the "privilege" of managing claims on bitcoins for you (claims which nearly always liquidate to dollars, NOT bitcoin--and what is a claim on a bitcoin that never actually liquidates to bitcoin?).

The price of a quark or bitcoin is irrelevant.  The value that matters is the market cap.  The market cap of bitcoin makes sense for a global digital currency that has billions in infrastructure built for it and is actually used around the world and doing tens of million in real transactions every day.  It's getting new users and merchants taking it every day.
Quark on the other hand has a 60 million dollar market cap...  for NOTHING.  It's not used for real transactions.  It has no infrastructure.  It's merely a speculation vehicle for momentum chasing speculators that are looking for a quick buck.

I'm sure that is partly to blame but BFL was very late and that was compounded by the fact they weren't the only mining hardware business out there.  BFL took my order in Feb promising shipment in a couple weeks and they failed that in spectacular fashion.  They were so late many other ASIC companies came online and started eating up the mining profits.  If they had shipped even remotely on time there would've been plenty of profits for all BFL preorders. 
Also they had the chips and boards and could've been mining the entire time they weren't shipping and supposedly dealing with issues that arose (e.g. underestimating power issues, etc.).  That's speculation but a reasonable one.

Bitcoin prices might continue rising, and quite significantly higher.  One reason is bitcoin is essentially online gold.  It's value is and will be related to its use as a decentralized, limited in number, online exchange currency.  There has never been such a thing so how do you price it?  Perhaps the closest comparison to bitcoin in the physical world is gold.  Gold is valued very high yet it's just a mostly useless metal...  it's value comes from its use as a physical world medium of exchange and store of wealth.
So what is "online gold" worth?  Will there be an online gold rush?  What would that look like?  Maybe we're seeing it now?
I'm sure there will be corrections along the way but if bitcoin is accepted into the market the upside might be higher than anyone would believe right now.

I was the first to complain on reddit and nobody refunded my loss or reinstated my order.  I took a loss, a real loss that was significant due to the big price move at the time.  All I got was an email apology.  It wasn't until after I made a stink on reddit that they started reinstating orders.  I'm sure there are hundreds of people who like me have been canceled and didn't know they could get the order reinstated.  Given the posts I'm sure dozens of people were canceled yesterday--most probably won't have their orders reinstated because they aren't reading reddit.  They'll just read the email, take it at face value and hope for "better luck next time" as the email says.

No, it's because anyone can spend the coins in an address if the private key is known for that address and they can do it from any wallet.  The OP had an address and private key in his wallet that was also in the wallet of another person because the address was used in a competition.  Any coins going to that address can be grabbed by anyone with that address and private key in their wallet.

$1000 is coming.  Maybe not this year but possibly.  $1000 per bitcoin is only a market cap of around 10 billion which isn't very big.  10 billion is the size of a single (larger) mid cap company. Harley Davidson is about a 10 billion market cap company as is Red Hat.  It's difficult to compare, but do you think bitcoin (a global payment system and currency) doesn't have the potential to be even bigger than a motorcycle company or an open source software provider company?  If it does get bigger than those (as I expect) $1000 isn't the top.
Edit: 
The market cap of Western Union is also 10 billion (down from 20 billion in 2008).  Bitcoin replaces Western Union.

When I say research I don't mean read a book. Read books to get ideas but in the end you have to go to the data on the market you're trading and see what works and what doesn't. I guarantee you the people you are trading against are running various simulations and gathering stats on a daily basis to use to take your money. Something like bitcoin is going up so much even lousy traders can make good money... for a while. It's difficult to be a day trader, similar to playing professional poker. Most people that do it will lose money and get mentally beat to hell in the process. Most people will do better than 90% of traders to simply buy and hold, especially with bitcoin.  But the proof is what you can do--if you can do it, do it. I know it's something people have to discover themselves...  it's just unfortunate that most people trying to trade bitcoin will learn a hard lesson and even lose money on what is the best buy and hold asset I've ever seen.

From the article: [Bitcoin has ] "no entity to restore trust in the currency with a guarantee, e.g. no central bank or government to offer a sovereign guarantee."  As no currencies are backed anymore, exactly what sort of guarantee do you think you get from a government for its currency?  A guarantee that a 20 dollar bill can be changed for two 5's and a 10?  A guarantee that they'll keep printing dollars by the billions and inflating away the value as long as people keep accepting the currency? 
I'll trust the laws of mathematics to secure bitcoin, you can keep your "sovereign guarantees."

Shorting can make for healthy markets depending on how the shorting is implemented.  Naked shorting, futures, or other systems that allow selling of the underlying that doesn't really exist can manipulate price or even crash the underlying.
I'd be wary of any futures or shorting technique with bitcoin as that will be where they eventually look to attack bitcoin.  Paper markets are weapons against the real markets these days.
You'll know things are screwed when people look to some "paper exchange" to find the price of bitcoin.  When that happens it's over.

It's not the job of honest money to prevent inflationary/deflationary debt systems.  Nor is it honest money's fault when they are created on top of the money.
Japan hasn't collapsed because their deficit numbers are still manageable, just as ours are.  However once certain levels of debt and deficit are reached a system owes too much and spends too much relative to what it takes in that it enters a self reenforcing monetary death spiral.  US deficits are currently falling due to income from the rising stock market however there is no political will to correct the longer term trend (nor any understanding of the danger we are in) and on the next slow down we'll be marching right toward collapse again.  The 40% deficit level number (and related debt level of 80% of GNP which we're past) comes from [a study of 29 historical hyperinflations by Bernholz](

Why complain about bitcoin volatility when the volatility is mostly up?   Is that much to complain about?  Bitcoin has been moving up 10x a year since it came out.  Doesn't seem like a problem to me, seems like an opportunity.
Bitcoin is tiny but with huge potential so what do you expect?  It still has to grow multiple factors before its big enough to get stable.  That means a TON of up still to come.  And a ton of up comes with the occasional pullback.

There is probably some way to structure this sort of "MAD escrow" without trusting a third-party website to hold the funds. That's it's advantage...  anonymous and no need for third party to hold funds. The website could generate a pair of bitcoin addresses to hold the "at risk" funds locked to private keys generated in such a way that nobody knows the way to access them until everyone agrees the transaction completed. I was thinking of a way to do that but hadn't thought of the MAD aspect. Generation of private keys might be similar to how the vanity key generators can generate vanity addresses without knowing the final private key.

Bitcoin isn't mature enough yet to replace anything.  It's speculative right now.  However there will be many times in the near future where the volatility of bitcoin will be nothing compared to the volatility of staying in a dying fiat currency and its related collapsing banking system.  So I guess it just depends what your options are where you happen to live.  Bitcoin is certainly a choice, and might be the best one depending on the situation (and situation to come).

In answer to WHY it's difficult to get coins:  because they aren't part of the current banking/money system.  
Also a bitcoin purchase can't be charged back and most banking transactions can be...  so the risk is you'll buy coins and then charge back your payment from whoever sold them to you.  As a result to buy bitcoins from the banking system requires waits, and/or verifications, and or big fees, etc.

Depends on the instrument but looking at gold as the example the dilution from paper instruments is thought to have significantly devalued gold. There is not enough gold in the world to settle all paper claims on gold in gold by several orders of magnitude, so gold is likely several orders of magnitude cheaper than it would be if these alternatives didn't exist. The system holds together because people don't ask to be settled in gold, they just cash in and out of the alternative instruments in currency.

My understanding is ripple has a central authority that controls it and decides what ripple is and what it isn't.  So it's ridiculous to say it's X or Y when that could change at the authorities whim tomorrow.  That and the authority pre-mined the coins and has control of them.  If you think that's at all similar to the truly decentralized nature of bitcoin you have holes in your head (as does anyone who uses ripple).

Coins in your wallet are yours and under your control.  Coins sent to an exchange (e.g. MtGox, BitStamp, etc.) are controlled by the exchange.  They owe you some number of coins and hopefully they will track it properly and send to you when you want to cash out.  When you cash out they will send you coins via the blockchain to an address you control.  But coins in an exchange are not at an address you control anymore.  Coin transfers between users on an exchange (when you buy and sell coins on the exchange) happen only on the exchange servers, not on the blockchain.

It makes is substantially more convenient to leverage and trade though.  You have to think like someone on wall street thinks.  A trader doesn't need bitcoin, they just want "exposure" to bitcoin.
Why are the Wrinkled twins bothering to make an ETF?  Isn't just holding the coins enough?  No, they want to have the coins AND have other people pay them to own paper bitcoins based on their bitcoins.  They get to leverage their bitcoin position and create a product that sells "bitcoin rights" off the blockchain.  The blockchain is restrictive and they can't monetize it, so they go to wall street.

Most people think in dollars and will see bitcoin as some sort of dollar based investment. Some who can see the bigger picture (e.g. gold/silver bugs) might more easily recognize bitcoin for what it is, a dollar alternative. Getting most average people to see that view is a huge educational challenge similar to getting them to understand what money really is and appreciate alternatives to fiat like gold--tough job, good luck.
Another issue is crashes destroy real value, so even people that have a clue will want to protect themselves from such events while keeping their purchasing power rather than spending it. So until price gets a lot more stable the problem isn't going away as you can't stop people trying to protect their wealth.

It's not stock it's flow.  They can provide enough paper bitcoin (backed by their own coins and other large holders) to satisfy demand and keep demand in the blockchain down.  The gold and silver ETFs do the same thing. People think they have bitcoin,  gold,  silver etc. but all they have is an IOU on some wall street clown's coins. They keep the bitcoin you don't even get a handshake.  It's centralized, possibly insecure or manipulated (how would you know otherwise?), and the antithesis of what gold and bitcoin are about. It's worse for bitcoin than a government outlawing coin in my opinion because it's more insidiously destructive to the ideals of gold/bitcoin and corrupts the bitcoin community from within confusing gold/bitcoin in people's minds and why it needs to exist. If you want bitcoins buy real bitcoins on the blockchain, don't pay someone else to hold theirs for you. 
TL;DR:  If you don't control the private key you don't own the bitcoin.

I don't know about the "average user" but I'd have ZERO interest in bitcoin if it wasn't decentralized.  I think you're simply wrong about what people interested in bitcoin are looking for.  There already are plenty of centralized digital currencies (including the dollar) and bitcoin has gained a ton of interest despite that because of its unique decentralized nature.  The huge technological leap bitcoin has made is its decentralization.  If you don't get that you don't get bitcoin.

Currently the incentives for bitcoin are setup correctly such that everyone has reason to play by the rules. But if bitcoin takes off then in the future I fear there will eventually be a change to allow more than 21 million bitcoins to be created. This will happen as the payouts drop far enough that there is more incentive for miners and others with power to get together and change the rules to their benefit (e.g. to use the deflation arguments we hear all the time as an excuse for extending bitcoin payouts for longer and thus extending bitcoin inflation and creating more coins than everyone thinks will exist today). I'm quite sure this will happen in the future. There is no real hard limit on coins so it's just a matter of time before those with the influence change rules to their benefit, just like the pigs in Animal Farm. I suspect it will happen once payouts get low enough.
Another future issue is secondary exchanges of various sorts. Currently there are hundreds of times more claims on gold than there is gold in the world because there is many times more volume in various paper exchanges and instruments than physical gold trading. This has deflated the true price of gold and disrupted it's purpose as a true trade/debt clearing asset. Bitcoin is likely to take the same route as there is a lot of incentive for people to get control of bitcoin transaction volume off the blockchain for their own benefit (Just look at the Wrinkled twins and their ETF as one example). Very few people understand this issue or think it is a problem so it's very likely to happen and dilute both bitcoin price and the intended goals of bitcoin for the enrichment in money and power to a few on wall street.
Both of these things I'm quite sure will eventually happen and I don't think there is anything that can be done about it.  Such is life and money.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:11:40
I think the point of it is it's another option.  With standard bitcoin purchase risk is on the buyer who sends his coins first and has to trust the seller.  This is an option that shifts the risk from buyer to seller while still giving the seller some ability to see the buyer has funds and has released them.  It's not perfect but it's easy and doesn't require a trusted 3rd party to act as escrow.

1) The 10% reserve requirement no longer does anything.  There are all sorts of tricks to get around it now (e.g. banks sweeping demand deposit funds into savings accounts or other accounts not subject to reserve requirements at the end of the day and sweeping them back in the morning).  Bottom line: banks are really not constrained by reserve requirements and the Fed hardly bothers trying to manage via changing reserve requirements because it no longer does anything.
2) The bank creation of money absolutely creates inflation.  What does it matter if it supposedly will be paid back if the practical result is endless creation of debt money?  Put the banking system in a black box and observe what it does: endless debt money spewing out of it.  That is absolutely inflationary.  Besides, if it wasn't, please explain where the observed inflation comes from?
3) Ever since going off the gold standard ALL our money in the system has come into being via debt (started by government borrowing it from the Fed) and all would go away if all debts were paid off.  There is no 5% asset at the source of it that would be left as you claim.

Sorry that price fell on you this time, but coinbase locking you in at a specific price is a good thing.  You know what price you are getting and how many coins.  When the coins arrive their value might be higher or lower but at least you know what you're getting.  Back when bitcoin was moving up price might be 100% higher in a week and you'd be very annoyed if you suddenly got half the coins you ordered due to price variation.
This is also how most things work.  Say you buy some precious metals.  You get quoted a certain amount at a certain price.  By the time the metal is delivered the value might have gone up or down but you got what you paid for at the time of the contract.

Once paper instruments like the bitcoin ETF get going people will be able to buy "exposure" to bitcoins without actually owning bitcoins on the blockchain. And thus the dilution of real bitcoins will begin. Same thing happened to gold. Now there is hundreds of times more claims on gold out there than there is actual gold in the world and nobody cares.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:00:00
And all of them won't be the exchange of actual bitcoins, they will be the exchange of bitcoin claims.  And those claims are what will be leveraged and used in place of actual bitcoins, artificially expanding the supply of bitcoins with fake "bitcoins" (with many people buying them not understanding they aren't bitcoins).  And then there will be the ETF options which are claims on the claims, and who knows what else.  If it goes like it has for gold then people will end up buying more wall street claims on bitcoin than people that buy bitcoin and bitcoin itself will stagnate.
The bottom line is these guys are making fake bitcoins to sell to people to make money and they'll be doing it on centralized exchanges that violate the entire concept of what makes bitcoin special.  In the process it dilutes the potential revolutionary future of bitcoin and its decentralized nature which is where bitcoins real gains are....  by how much I don't know, but I don't want to find out.

@_date: 2013-03-25 17:58:25
1) It's called a stop loss.  Most bitcoin exchanges don't have it which is probably good because if you set a stop loss it will likely lose you money.  Bitcoin is very volatile and can fall a LONG way and still be in a bullish uptrend.
If you're going to buy, buy what you can afford to lose without worrying about putting stops.  If you buy so much you have to worry about stops you're going to lose money.  Your stops will likely get hit even if bitcoin eventually continues up.
Another reason stops suck is they execute a sell into a falling market and have no price guarantee--you get what the market is providing at that moment.  So for example if your stop triggers when prices fall to $60 that doesn't mean you get $60--when the sale actually executes it might sell at $50 if the market is falling fast because that's what the market provides at that moment.  
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:49:01

Bitcoin could easily go back to a buck or two at any time.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it did due to political factors.  If the government decided bitcoin was a risk to them or the banks they might decide to manipulate the price (like they have with gold/silver).

Withdrawals from your bank can be reversed while bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed so the waiting period is to reduce the risk coinbase takes selling you bitcoins.

Because of the fees it's a negative return game.  Maybe you win but odds are you lose, just like with gambling.  In the case with bitcoin its going up so high so fast you can make money even if you trade badly.  But odds are you won't make as much as simply holding.  I bet if you look at what you would've made if you'd simply invested and held vs what you've done trading you will find out trading has cost you money (while being time consuming and stressful at the same time).

Yes. The government manipulates precious metals prices and those are much larger markets. Bitcoin is arguably a larger threat than PMs to governments.  Bitcoin could be sent to near zero without much cost to a government. They just sell a lot of bitcoin (bought previously over time) into the market during off hours when there is not much liquidity. Prices will crash, ordinary folk will panic-sell driving price even lower, and oddly the government will be able to then buy back for next to nothing to save for the next time they want to crash the price. They might even profit by causing the low prices they then buy into to sell later if/when prices recover. This is actually what I expect the government to do to bitcoin eventually.  **Watch for big market down moves during off hours when there is not much liquidity and there is your manipulation.  It is coming one day.**
The weak point of bitcoin is the exchange and it's likely where the government will act against bitcoin.

Oh they'll have coins... a lot of coins.  Just no way to tell who really owns the coins.  Again just like gold. 
Some estimate there are magnitudes more paper claims on gold than there is actual gold in the world. That mess didn't happen over night but it did happen once people started accepting claims on gold as being basically the same as gold. Same thing could happen to bitcoin if people let paper claims to bitcoin replace actual bitcoins.  Suddenly wall street will be "printing" bitcoins just like they do gold. Then that 21 million limit on bitcoin won't mean anything. People are trying to figure how to do this right now. There is a lot of money in it if they can pull it off and there is already a template of how to do it with gold. If you buy some off blockchain wall street product for paper bitcoin you are the sucker, and the problem for the rest of us that care about bitcoin.
ETFs actually won't be the big problem, the forex market is where 10, 100 or even 1000s of times more bitcoin leverage will exist than actual bitcoin. It will be the tail that wags the bitcoin dog just like it wags physical gold price.

I joined reddit specifically to tell people my problem using coinbase.  If you don't want to believe me go right ahead.  But I had an order with significant unrealized price gains canceled and apparently so have many others.  I've also had 3 other orders go through fine with no other problems including one that completed today (though no significant price gains).  So take what you will of that experience.
I think what they might be doing is taking your order and then waiting for btc prices to drop lower than your buy price to fill your order.  Usually prices fall lower during the week of waiting but if they don't, and they end up sitting on a large loss then they just cancel your order.  That's just speculation of course, but it fits and nobody at coinbase has explained exactly what they do to manage price risk during pending orders.

Traders lose. It's a lesson you have to learn yourself because it seems like it would be easy to do better by trading.  But it's not.  Luckily it's a lesson I learned over years before bitcoin, but a lot of people will learn it with bitcoin and reduce the gains on the best investment of their lives.  Some will manage to actually lose money... can you imagine? Losing money in something moving from $10 to $350 in a year.  Some are doing it right now.... working and stressing so hard to actually lose money on the best performing asset around.
From experience I know I'm doing better than most all who trade just by believing in the purchase and just holding and letting bitcoin grow. And Sometimes adding on dips and lulls.
If you're a trader you have my sympathies--I've been there.

I agree that progress has made things cheaper and better and has associated productivity increases, etc. all of which should raise our standard of living and increase the value of our currency. However, monetarily, all of these gains and more (e.g. deflation due to population increase) have been taken by government and banks to the point where instead of a net value being added to our system (which would be reflected in higher value of money) the devaluation of our currency has eaten all the gains plus another 3-4% giving us our current inflation rate.  The redirection of this value has gone to the government and financial services (which is why both of those sectors have grown so huge over the last several decades).   Neither of these sectors is really productive either and so not only is there no real net gain, we are seeing a net loss in manufacturing and other productive areas of the country.  Meanwhile the majority of the middle class and lower which don't have access to the inflation engine in the government and financial sectors have fallen behind and the gap between rich and poor has never been wider.
In short you are right about what should be happening due to progress and productivity.  Unfortunately what is actually happening is the deprecation of the money feeds those gains and more to the agents that are closest to the source of inflation.  Everyone else suffers.  They manipulate the measure of inflation (among other things) to try to hide the size of the growing gap (and reduce inflation-linked costs like social security), but even with those changes the reality is obvious to anyone who has been around long enough to see the before and after.  You can also see it in any chart of % of population employed by government over time, size of government over time, size of financial sector over time, etc.  Those are growing gangbusters while productive areas of the country and the middle class shrink.
We're now within perhaps 20 years of complete monetary failure.  Nobody would've believed it 15 years ago if you told them the government would be printing 85 billion a month simply to keep the economy barely moving forward.  Few would believe it if now I said the printing has only just begun.  Bitcoin is a result of these issues.  It would not even exist if circumstances weren't so dire.

Ah, then it means coinbase has reached IT'S maximum number of sells for some time period and won't sell more.  I haven't seen that before but I've seen a similar restriction on buys.
Buy/sell when it's calmer and you won't have trouble with coinbase (and price will often be better than when people are freaking out too).  If you want a better platform to buy/sell at critical moments or to buy/sell often, go with an exchange (though they too have gone down down in extreme moves--the last peak drop at $250 there were massive problems with the exchanges).

If you leave coin in that sort of account don't be surprised if you become a statistic. It's not like fiat in a bank account where there is FDIC and insurance to protect you. This is the wild west.

No they haven't. They never honored my canceled transaction and I was the first to complain publicly.

The point of a brain wallet is to make it easier to remember your private key.  It boils down to a simplification of the private key and results in the reduction of possibilities for the key.

Coinbase is not a typical bitcoin wallet service, it is something a bit different.  Coinbase manages your private keys internally and actually doesn't allow you to even see them.  It tries to present a simpler view of bitcoin but as a result you must rely on them for security of your coins that are in that account.  Personally I move most my coins out as I'd rather keep control myself.

Are you even reading the complaints from people?  People are losing the price gains made during the transaction pending period (for some reason transactions are canceled after a week).  So coinbase gets to keep the price gains lost by their customers which in my case and in the case of many people here has been *significantly* more than any fees.

In my opinion you don't get it.  Backing is only needed when something doesn't have value on its own (like a piece of paper called a "dollar" as you point out).  Nobody even thinks gold needs backing--it has intrinsic value itself.  To suggest bitcoin needs to be backed is to say that it's not fit to be an online currency on its own and that is flat out wrong.  Bitcoin doesn't need gold's credibility, it has its own--and it has BETTER properties than gold for online use.
The market will discover and use bitcoin because it is fit for the purpose.  Or it won't.  Trying to bribe the market by associating the value of some other commodity to bitcoin is a temporary bandaid to a problem that bitcoin doesn't have.  If bitcoin needed that bandaid I wouldn't be interested in it, and neither would the market because it would mean bitcoin wasn't fit for its intended purpose.

Bitcoin isn't fiat by definition as there is no authority declaring it to have value.  The word "fiat" even means authoritative order.  There is no such thing with bitcoin.  The value of bitcoin is derived from its intrinsic properties that make it useful for exchange and storage of value.  This is also where gold gets it value.  Or is gold fiat too because it's not backed? Lol.

The server running SR had to have access to private keys for the coins that were moving around SR (or else it couldn't manage the coins).  When the government took over the server they got access to those keys and their coins.

Did you even read the original post above?  It's not about me getting my coins.

It's not the cheapest but you can get coins today with bitinstant.com but you'll have to go to a walmart or walgreens or something for the payment.
Coinbase is cheaper and easier but you have to attach a bank account and get it verified.  Then you have to wait a week for your order to go through (assuming they actually have coins to sell that day and don't cancel your order after a week of waiting because they decide you are high risk).

I'd be willing to bet a significant amount of money these emails have nothing to do with risk management but are some sort of default email sent when the automated transaction fails for some reason (e.g. when the hot wallet is out of coins to fulfill the transaction, or servers fail due to stress). It's always duing a price spike when service would be stressed and it's always to people whose wait is over and transaction should be executing.

My understanding is that Linux is safer than windows but that's not really relevant in my case.  I'd still be worried about malware even on Linux.  When I boot off a Linux live CD (from a CD or properly setup USB) it's a boot from the original binaries every time.  While running and on shut down it doesn't write back to the disk.  So the security comes from the fact it's like using a *freshly installed* operating system each time it boots up.  It *can't* be infected with any malware.  If Windows had a Live CD ability like Linux does you might be able to do the same thing with it, but it doesn't.

Yes hopefully the online protocol nature of bitcoin will trump alternative off blockchain instruments, but we just don't know how it will turn out.

Blockchain is better as a wallet, coinbase is better (for some people) for transferring in and out of a US bank account.
You don't control your private keys with Coinbase so I wouldn't leave any serious amount of coin there as it has more 3rd party risk than blockchain.  
Coinbase has easy transfers but some orders have been canceled recently leaving customers who thought they had coins and gains on those coins left out to dry with little explanation.  Personally I suspect coinbase of having problems with their long transfer wait times coupled with the volatility of bitcoin price and as a result they are offloading the associated price risks onto customers in questionable ways.  Until I hear differently I don't recommend them.  I do recommend blockchain.info as a wallet.

You can't compare localbitcoins to exchanges they are very different things.  And I'm not arguing against exchanges anyway, I'm arguing against trading.  I understand you can't stop trading however we can stop glorifying it and pretending it a cool way to make money when really it's just a cool way for exchanges to make money off the uninformed.  The money flow in trading is exactly the same as the money flow in a casino:  from the participants to the house.  Exchanges are needed but people and bots sitting around non-productively buying and selling price movement is not.

More like BOTH gold and bitcoin will become manipulated for similar reasons and by similar techniques. So many here are cheering things like a bitcoin ETF but those sorts of huge off blockchain instruments are how you create a "paper" market for bitcoin that eventually comes to dilute real bitcoins and dominate their price. It's how they took control of gold.
Edit: downvoters should learn gold's history so they'll know what could happen to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:38:45
In my view if bitcoin doesn't fail somehow $1000 will easily be reached.  $1000 a bitcoin is what we'd see if bitcoin got the same interest as the total wealth in the silver ETF (SLV) alone.  If it achieved interest similar to that in the gold ETF (GLD) that would be $7000 a bitcoin.  Give it a few years and I think bitcoin can easily do better than the interest in the silver ETF.

CoinValidation is actually less of a threat than wall street products in my opinion.  At least CoinValidation uses the blockchain.  People that don't understand why bitcoin is so revolutionary (hint: the blockchain!) are quick to think having bitcoin in ETFs and other wall street off-blockchain products would be great.  But it very well could be the death of what is revolutionary about bitcoin.  And without the promise of what bitcoin can do that is revolutionary, its price will plummet.

Coinbase is not a standard wallet.  It manages your bitcoin addresses and the private keys for you.  There is no client-side encryption like blockchain.info.  You cannot get access to the private keys to your bitcoins on coinbase.  By design you must trust coinbase fully to control your coins (and in return they take on the issues of securing them and backing them up and making access easy).
If you transfer between coinbase users it just handles the transfer on its own internal databases.  If you transfer out of coinbase then it moves actual bitcoins on the blockchain.

The "making pretty things" value of gold is what... $1 an oz out of $1200?  Maybe less if you compare similar value for other pretty craft supplies.  It's the monetary aspect of gold that gives it the bulk of its value. It's actually a requirement of a monetary commodity to be mostly useless because it keeps the supply/demand dynamics from the industrial use of the commodity from causing volatility in the monetary frame. This makes the article's question not only pointless but a showcase for their ignorance of gold and why it is a monetary commodity. 
However it's still possible to answer the question (bad as it might be). Bitcoin has some small value as transferable digital property... something that didn't even exist a few years ago. As a digital world transferable token it does something unique that has value. However assigning that token a purpose (e.g. currency, poker chip, bond, stock, etc.) gives it a much higher value than it has as a mere transferable token. This is exactly what happens with gold where a pretty metal that doesn't corrode takes on a much higher value for what it represents, not what it is.  You would hope Nobel winning economists would know this.
@_date: 2013-04-27 14:47:15
If bitcoin goes through the roof at the expense of some other currency or currencies, it will because of a failure of confidence in the falling currency/government.  Any alternative would be sought from the failing currency, including gold. I don't think any currency has anything to worry about from bitcoin... it's their own government that would be the problem.

A typical 50% correction of the up move from $15 to $49 would take us to $32.  We're already lower than a 33% pullback which would be around $38.  A 66% pullback takes us down to $26.  I'll buy some at $32 and more at $26 if it gets there.  If we fall below $26, well that wouldn't be very bullish.

The very measure of inflation has been changed over the years to reduce inflation on paper. But even the manipulated numbers show wages haven't kept up. Minimum wage from the 60's in coinage from that period is over $21/hour in todays dollars. It's no surprise with that that families used to get by with one wage earner, now they struggle to survive with two wage earners.

Of course people are interested.  Who wouldn't want to make money without actually doing anything?  The problem is if everyone does that it corrupts the economy and society...  and that's exactly what we're seeing.  Late in periods of hyperinflation societies become fixated on speculation.  Companies actually cease production to focus on speculation because it's more profitable, but what's really happening is the collapse of the economy.  We might be in the early stages of that now.  
As for why I'd be angry about the corruption of our economy... who wouldn't be?  The problem is most people don't recognize what is happening.  The downvotes on my posts here are the perfect example.

The market cap of bitcoin is well under 2 billion.  It is small, new and volatile.  The market cap of gold is trillions, it is much more stable.  These are simple facts.  It's perfectly reasonable to price in gold when you need stability.  Bitcoin simply isn't big enough for stability yet as much as you might wish that it were.

The issue is services like DropBox keep versioned copies of files.  So if you put an encrypted TrueCrypt drive file on DropBox (for example), then DropBox sees (and stores!) every change that happens to that file over time.  So each change made to structured encryption technologies like TrueCrypt can be examined in order and certain things might become discoverable.  For example, the existence of the hidden volume feature of TrueCrypt, headers, and I wonder if possibly even the password itself might be able to be figured out with enough past history of changes to the file.  Again I'm not an expert and I'd like to hear an expert opinion on this...  but for myself I don't think it's a good idea.
In short there's a big difference between what someone might be able to discover having access to an encrypted file and what they might be able to discover having access to an encrypted file and its 10 previous versions.  If you think encrypting files and putting them on DropBox makes them secure, you might be flat wrong if you make modifications to those files over time (unless you took extreme measures like changing the password each time you changed the file contents).

And by the way, creating these paper markets is how they control the price of alternative commodity currencies like gold.

Fiat derives its value from some authority (usually a government).  Governments come and go and with them their fiat.  Money that is selected by the market and is valued for what it provides (like gold or bitcoin) rather than by decree isn't as likely to lose value and cause massive economic suffering like is seen during fiat collapse.
In our case we're within perhaps 10 to 40 years or so from a significant change or failure of the dollar.  Many other fiat currencies around the globe are failing or already failed (and we can watch the destruction of the middle class as we speak here in the US).  It really is a unique period.  Bitcoin might be able to help people reduce their economic suffering through this period.

@_date: 2013-10-20 13:23:02
I suspect that long term, with the exception of short perods after large price increases, mining will never be profitable anymore. This is because mining is the only way to get newly created coins... anonymous coins with no history. Anonymous coins will probably carry a slight premium over other coins. So mining a coin will tend to cost you the price of buying a coin plus that small premium. In other words I suspect it will almost always be cheaper to simply buy bitcoin over mining them from here. Bitcoin is big enough the days of free money from mining are over.

Go to bitaddress.org and play around a bit making paper and other wallets. All a wallet really is is a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by others in order to send money to the wallet but nobody can get money out of the wallet without the private key which should be kept secret. Anyone that has the private key can take the coins from the wallet. If you print a paper wallet, cut off the private key and put it in a safe, you can use the public key to move coins in but nobody should have access to take coins out without access to the private key which is in your safe. In short a wallet address is as safe as its private key.
Normally the wallet software hides the details from you so its good to see what is behind it and bitaddress.org made it clearer to me.

The "traders" in this case aren't looking to trade, they're looking for exploits to the system.  A trivial way to stop these exploits is to slow down trades to reasonable human levels. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 21:25:17
Right.  And yet that "owner" has their customer (ME in this case) taking the downside risk on those coins during the transfer waiting period.  That's my problem here.  They can basically buy coins (or wait to buy coins) and depending on what the prices do keep the gains or push losses onto the customer.  
If these are isolated incidents then perhaps it's no big deal (and might not be a big deal to reimburse those of us that got screwed out of our gains).  But if cancellations continue I'd be looking into a class action lawsuit or something.
@_date: 2013-01-31 16:05:16
that would be a heck of a scam. Take orders and wait a week for price to fall so you can buy and make a profit. if price never falls but only goes up, cancel the order.

The dollar is not chosen by the market.  It is used because of authoritative decree from the US government.  Nobody wanted their gold outlawed in the 30's.  No other country wanted the US to default on the gold backing of dollars in the 70's.  The market did not choose where we are.  If the government were to fail or change, so would the dollar (though failure of the dollar itself can collapse the government so it's a chicken-egg thing).

I've read that supposedly 79% of bitcoins are being bought and held for their upside potential.  That sort of speculative holding can make for big downside when price eventually corrects and weak hands sell.  In other words demand for actual use is very different than speculative demand.  So yeah there's a lot of demand for bitcoins but it's mostly speculative and that is the sort of fickle demand that can change on a dime.

Price discovery would exist just fine without traders.  People and companies buying for more legitimate reasons than to immediately again sell again in a few minutes or hours discover prices, and more true prices at that.  Tighter spreads is just another way to say liquidity and that was already mentioned.  And I don't think active trading actually leads to tighter speads, it leads to tighter speads in some cases (cases where it isn't really needed) and in other cases very wide spreads (cases where liquidity is needed trading liquidity dries up), but the bad quality of the liquidity that trading provides is a complex and controversial topic.

In wall street markets this is common. The real money players stay hidden keeping their money size out of the book using "iceburg" orders, dark pools, and other techniques. They don't want anyone to see where they are buying or in what size. It's only the dumb money you actually see in the book.

Wrong, that is a well known fallacy and just repeating it isn't an argument.
 Bitcoin gets its value out of the gate by being useful.  If bitcoins weren't actually useful they wouldn't be worth anything even though they cost electricity, etc. to create.  From the very start people valued bitcoins because what they were capable of, not because they had to put in effort to get them--nobody would've put in any effort if they didn't see they were useful from the start.
If you doubt it start an alt-coin that can't do anything but does cost a lot more than bitcoin to mine.  See how many people think it has any value let alone more value than bitcoin.

Why would you bother when the price is replicated in a product right in your brokerage account? The point is you no longer need gold/bitcoins!  That's what this does.  Once wall street takes over the majority of the pricing, bitcoins are no longer are priced by the value of their nature and their distributed network, they're priced by wall street.  And what is the value of a supposedly distributed exchange currency that has become more wall street product on a centralized exchange than it is an actual bitcoin?  This same thing happened to gold.  Very few people understand this.  I hope you're right and with bitcoin being easy to transfer it goes differently...  I guess we'll see.

It's not so much a question of price as market cap.  Right now with around a 400mil mcap bitcoin is like a small cap stock.  To hit mid cap it would need to be more than 2 billion mcap or &gt; $200/bitcoin.  In the near term I doubt we can get over $100.  Longer term who knows.
If bitcoin was to grow to about the worth/size of the silver ETF (SLV) that would be a price of around $1000/btc.  To be around the size of the gold ETF (GLD) that would be a price of around $7100.

Actually they are doing something illegal and immoral and you'd know this if you had studied the issue at all.  The Securities Act of 1934 makes it illegal to manipulate price in any way.  It is illegal to cause "a series of transactions ... creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others" (Google "15 USC 78i" for more).  Also a violation:  "creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any security ... or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market."  In short the entry of an order without intent to actually execute is a violation (which is precisely what much of HFTing is as the immediate cancellation of orders once the order book is effected proves).  HFT traders are also in violation of agreements they make with the exchanges where they have agreed not to place orders to manipulate price, book, or otherwise without intent to trade.  Exchanges have started to crack down on this illegal activity with fees (google "The Exchange-Driven HFT Backlash" for more), but really they should just close accounts...  I'm sure they'd be quicker cracking down on this but the sad fact is the exchanges make a lot of money from HFT and don't really care that it effects everyone else if they make their money.  It's disgusting, illegal, and immoral and unfortunately the exchanges are party to it.

Constant devaluation of currency (inflation) is bad in many ways.  First the "lost" value isn't lost, it goes somewhere...  in this case to the government, banks, etc. and leads to expanding government, market inefficiencies and malinvestments, income disparity, and other problems.  Also it discourages saving and encourages spending/debt which tends to gut the productive capacity of the population and put them (and government) into more and more debt.  All this leads to social and economic ruin over time.

Today I had my most recent coinbase purchase complete successfully.  So I've had 3 out of 4 complete fine.  Generally I find coinbase easy to use and it works.  However the one order they canceled was the one order that had significant price gains (that coinbase kept at my expense).  It still smells fishy and nobody at coinbase has answered my questions either in email or on reddit (and I've got two threads here that they have responded to, but not to answer the real question as to what happened to the unrealized price gains in my coins that were canceled).  So go ahead and use coinbase...  it has worked for me mostly.  But don't be surprised if an order you have that makes some big gains while still "pending" ends up being canceled.  And don't say you weren't warned.

In a similar way, if you're considering spending your time writing a bitcoin trading robot vs a website or service that uses bitcoins in some way, for god sake make the website/service.  One is productive to bitcoins and the bitcoin economy, the other is non-productive and leeches off the bitcoin economy.  I wish Wall Street would figure that out.

For a quick estimate, when you get a bitcoin price just think about how many ounces of silver that would buy, then think how many grams of gold the silver would buy, then think how many shots of vodka the gold would buy then convert shots of vodka into dollars and there's your dollar price.  Easy.

Sweeps work by moving money from demand accounts (that have reserve requirements) into accounts that don't have reserve requirements (like savings accounts) after the bank closes but before reserve requirements are calculated for the day.  Then they calculate reserve requirements.  The next morning they sweep them back before the bank opens.  Google sweeps and reserve requirements and you'll probably find several articles on this.
Reserve requirements and its related money multiplier also really don't have any impact anymore due to [the shadow banking system](
Central banks are the first cause of inflation up stream, but their total impact on inflation is much less than banks and the shadow banking system that lend out that base money and multiply it many times over.

Unfortunately all that volume is on bitcoin exchanges, not on the blockchain.

You do realize that for every coin sold at the top someone bought at the top, right? And for every one who buys back at the bottom another sold.  And meanwhile the exchanges take a cut from both sides, just like the house in a casino. The bottom line is overall, trading is a losing game. Most traders aren't profitable. Bitcoin goes up so much it's difficult to lose, but some manage it and most the rest underperform compared to just holding.
Good luck with your trades, you'll need it the longer you do it. Especially with bitcoin as its exchanges tend to go down right when it hurts you the worst. Anyone just holding has made 5000% this year doing nothing. You're not likely to beat that trading. But I realize it's a lesson people have to learn themselves.

I'm not against loans.  If the loan debt is productive it can be good for the economy.  Loans are straightforward even in bitcoin and doesn't require banks.  Banks are the problem as they hide the reality of the loan from the public...  you think your money is in the bank and can be accessed "on demand" but in reality it's being lost in some defaulting foreign bond or subprime mortgage security.  You don't need to put your bitcoins in a bank, they are already safe and won't lose value to inflation due to the nature of bitcoin.  If you're not happy just saving your bitcoins (and having their deflation rate of return) and want to get more of a return on them then buy an investment or do P2P lending or something.  Then you know you're getting rid of your bitcoins to take a risk and can take responsibility for that risk yourself.  You're thinking last century, banks are irrelevant now.

The younger generation has never seen it but there was a time not too long ago when credit cards were very difficult to get and only the rich had them. A gold card actually said something. Banks didn't securitize debt to pass on to other suckers. They didn't expect to get bailed out no matter what stupid mess they got themselves into.  They made money by making careful loans that would be paid back. Now my dog gets preapproved credit offers.

It's not the price, it's the rate of change.  Prices have basically doubled in a little over a month.  That's such a rapid change there is very little room for price growth to continue in the short term.  Do you think it's going to double again in half a month? Doubtful. When the rate of change gets this extreme in practically any market the odds of a correction become very high.  On the plus side a correction might not be too severe, but there does need to be some pullback to make room for further future growth.

I agree bitcoin is easier to store and transfer than gold.  However that's only one reason people use paper gold rather than real gold.  A bigger reason is leverage.  
Wall street products offer leverage (often significant leverage) which is both a highly desired feature for the investor and a critical problem for real bitcoin.  This leverage creates false "debt-like" bitcoin off the blockchain...  and as the market (forex is the biggest culprit but but also ETFs, related options, etc.) gets mature there will be significantly more value rolling around in leveraged bitcoin bets than there is actual bitcoin.  This is precisely what happens with gold and why actual physical gold trading is such an insignificant part of the total gold market now.  And I expect that eventually actual on-blockchain exchanges of bitcoin will be the minority of the value of bitcoin being exchanged.  
This is why when others are cheering the latest news about an ETF or XBT being added to forex, I'm shaking my head.  Gold shows us what happens.  How will bitcoin reach its real value and possible uses when wall street creates 100 times more false bitcoin for itself than actual bitcoin exists?

I've heard it said that no company with a larger market cap than bitcoin will invest in bitcoin (and I think that's likely true).  For bitcoin to become bigger than Best Buy (which has an 8 billion market cap) a bitcoin would have to be priced over $800.  So let smaller companies invest in bitcoin and then as it eventually grows to 10 billion (roughly $1000 a coin), then expect Best Buy to maybe accept it.
But I think $1000 a bitcoin is a given, it's just a matter of when.

Again you should read some history rather than just making things up.  Bitcoin was to a large extent modeled after gold...  you might look into these subjects a bit if you want to really understand bitcoin and money.
Here's a photo of some of the various gold coins in circulation at the time--that's right, a dollar was defined as a particular weight of gold and people walked around with gold coins and shops actually took them, imagine that.  Paper money existed too but had real value as it was exchangeable into gold at any time.
[U.S. Gold Coins](
When gold was outlawed they literally took the gold coins from everyone and gave them paper money that could no longer be exchanged for gold.  Then they devalued the currency shortly there after (stealing value from all citizens savings under the pretext of stimulation to end the depression).  Where do you think all the gold in Fort Knox came from?  It came from the people's confiscated coins.  That was also the year they stopped minting gold coins.  This is all very important history to know especially if you want to understand bitcoin, you should look into it.  
And actually it wasn't just the US.  Most of the entire world was using gold currency back then.  The current global fiat system is quite young and unlikely to last for very long.  No fiat system has ever survived for very long and most fail within a few decades.  Ours has only been around since the 70's.  Many people think the current financial crisis is the beginning of the failure of the current fiat system.  This all ties into why bitcoin was created in the first place.

Banks and government work together in a symbiotic relationship to create inflation and receive the value of that inflation themselves.  This absolutely puts them together as the core of these problems.  Banks are actually worse than the government but they hide it better and that's another story.
Your views on taxes are a whole other story also.  But let me just say the real reason for taxes today isn't to fund government, it's to provide a basis for fiat.  Income tax was passed in 1913, the same year the Fed was created (note that the Fed is a cabal of private banks--symbiotic relationship remember).  A while later gold was outlawed in the first major step to fiat and full fiat came in the 70's.  Now the Fed makes as much money as the government wants (either directly via QE printing and the treasury or indirectly via bond sales).  Money is nothing but paper.  The government can make it at its whim.  Taxes are a facade that is only needed to force a demand for the monopoly money we use to give it artificial value it wouldn't otherwise have.  It doesn't matter how much the government redistributes to buy votes to stay in power, those with access to the inflation engine will continue to get more wealthy.  It's the middle and upper middle class that bare the brunt of taxes and don't have access to the free money the government and financial system make.  The whole thing just makes the gap even wider, pushing the upper middle and middle class down as well.  There will be no chance for equality when the source of the inequality runs full steam ahead.  Until the current money system fails, and again that will be in the next 20 years or so (if not sooner), nothing will change.  Watch the government budget deficit numbers...  when government spending goes over 40% of income (which it eventually will), the death spiral begins.

No there is a loss.  You agreed to buy coins at a certain price, so if the coins drop in price during the week long waiting period you are expected to take the loss.  If the coins go up in price you should get the gains and if instead the order is canceled on you then someone else got the gains while you were taking the downside risk at your expense.  That's why coinbase has been making the issue right when this happens.

That's the thing... those of us that got in a long while back aren't investing.  Some of us are "crazy" and think we're changing the world and making a new type of asset that will outlast the dollar and other failing fiat currencies. For us nothing has changed.  "Investors" might want to find out what bitcoin really is, or take their gains (or losses) and come back when the world is changed and what bitcoin is becomes clear even to them.

The entire point of the post above is to explain how that large gain is possible without bitcoin being a value-free bubble.  You can't look at price gain alone and conclude "bubble."  The bottom line is there is real value here and the gain is the recognition of that value happening rapidly.

Sorry to burst your bubble but incomes have not risen at the same rate as inflation and inflation reporting has been changed over the years on top of that to report less inflation than exists.  Standard of living is significantly lower now than it was several decades back (it peaked in the late 60's as I recall).  For example one wage earner used to be able to support a family of three on minimum wage.  Now you can't even support yourself on that.  Women didn't used to need to work, now families need 2 times the number of wage earners as a few decades ago and a wallet full of credit cards to survive. But, 'Murica! and all that... you've got an ipad so you're better off, right?  Now back to your regularly scheduled media misinformation.

There is no difficulty in paying dollar denominated debt--we can create dollars at will.  The problem exists for the creditors...  they get paid in devalued dollars.  Until creditors start demanding higher interest rates to compensate for devalued currency (or asking for debts to be paid in gold or something) nothing will change.

You don't have to concentrate ownership of bitcoins to get control of the bitcoin market.  These days control of bitcoin is more likely to come about by financial "products" like ETFs, derivatives and such.  Once you get a large enough amount of leverage in a derivative market you can control the underlying market (tail wags the dog).  
Based on some recent posts, some oblivious bitcoin users (more interested in the "investment" aspect and not the real uses for bitcoin) are even actively trying to get ETFs and other such derivative instruments created for bitcoin.  They think it will be easier to trade bitcoin in a derivative market rather than in the actual market (and they are probably right).  But the result will be a collar around bitcoin where bitcoin becomes the bitch of some leveraged, CENTRALLY MANAGED derivative market.

Bitcoin price needs to increase dramatically before bitcoin will be stable enough in value to be useful as a currency.  At $150/bitcoin the market cap is in the small cap stock range--way to small a market cap for a global currency.   This is why the price is so volatile...  bitcoin is just too small for the attention it's starting to get.   At $1000 a coin (11 billion market cap) bitcoin would be more stable, though even 11 billion is small for the sort of attention bitcoin might generate.
Bottom line is bitcoin price isn't likely to be stable during its growth phase.  It has to grow a LOT more until it's huge and sluggish and boring.  Then it will enter a stage where it's more useful as a currency.

The days of easy money from mining are over.  It now takes serious hardware to mine and low cost, quick assess to that hardware to be profitable.  So if you go out and buy specialized mining hardware it will likely be obsolete by the time it actually ships to you.
This might change in the future if bitcoin rapidly goes up in value another 10x or something, but right now that's the state of mining.  You're better off just putting the money from mining hardware and electricity right into buying bitcoin.

Gold used to be the basis of the US financial system.  However it was made illegal to even own for US citizens back in the 30's during the depression and didn't become legal again until the 70's after they had finished removing all backing of US money from gold.  Even today my understanding is it's not legal to buy things directly with gold, you have to sell the gold for dollars then buy with dollars.
In short gold doesn't "suck" it was outlawed by the government so the government could get control of money.  The government could not control gold as they can't print gold.  The result has been the decimation of the value of the dollar, the massive expansion of the government, and the ongoing decline in the standard of living in America.

When it works it's easy and inexpensive.  However it doesn't always work.  Some people's bitcoin buys are rejected after a week of waiting supposedly due to being "high risk."  And sometimes your buy won't go through at all (often when bitcoin is moving up) due to coinbase having a limit on the number of site-wide buys available in a 24 hour period.  Frankly it's a bit of a crap-shoot.  But it's great when it works.
It's also worth mentioning that the coinbase wallet is not a standard wallet.  You do not have control of the private keys for your coins, you have to trust coinbase.  Also people report delays when sending coins out of the coinbase wallet making it bad for face-to-face transactions.  In short it's a good idea to move your coins out of coinbase into a different wallet after you buy them.

Any of the address/key pairs generated by BitAddress.org can be imported into typical bitcoin wallet software like at blockchain.org.  You can also generate addresses in the wallet software.  Addresses are easy to create and you can create as many as you want.  For a highest security paper wallet you would only import the public key into the wallet software (making a "watch-only" address), the private key goes in a safe.  You can send coins to the watch-only address, you just can't take money out of it until you import the private key from the paper in the safe.
It's a big subject and this is to just get you started.  I'm no expert but I remember going through the same learning curve you're going through.  Good luck and have fun!

* The sale of the hat can't be charged back if it was made in bitcoins in contrast to a sale in dollars.
* An exchange made in bitcoin doesn't go through the banking system and "clears" in minutes rather than days.
* The supply of dollars is controlled by the banks/government and as a result the value of dollars is constantly falling over time.  Bitcoin can't be printed at the whim of a government and has been rising in value over time.
* A dollar based account might be frozen and your assets grabbed by someone who claims authority at any time for whatever reason they imagine.  Bitcoins are controlled by you and cannot be confiscated nor your "account" frozen.

I've got Krugman's "The Return of Depression Economics" right in front of me and it has the baby sitting co-op story in it starting on page 8.  One flaw in the story when applied to bitcoin is the baby sitting co-op coupons could not be divided.  The value of the coupons was rightfully rising but as the coupons couldn't be divided to get that value out.  If they could be divided, like bitcoins can be divided, there could be as many coupons as needed and their value would reflect their scarcity when being horded or lack of scarcity when not being horded.
Forbes' response to the division issue is nonsensical from my reading of it.
Nothing like using the story of a flawed "currency" to "prove" that we all need a central authority to issue money or we'll all be doomed.  I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that having a central authority issuing money is what is dooming us!

Coinbase is not an exchange that matches buyers and sellers. If you want to lose your money "trading" use an actual exchange (or save time and go to some gambling site, you'll get a similar result).
A clue for the downvoters:
Short term trading is essentially a zero sum game as every buyer has a seller and vice versa. However as the exchange collects a trading fee from both parties it's not really a zero sum game--the exchange ends up winning over time comparable to the house at a gambling site.  But go ahead and "trade" and pretend you're not gambling.

Fiat eventually  dies and usually within a few decades. We will likely see the death of several major fiat currencies in the next couple decades... maybe even the death of the dollar.  Bitcoin has a good chance to outlast the dollar.  The decline of fiat is as much a reason for the creation and rise of bitcoin as anything. Imagine where bitcoin will be when the decline of the dollar is clear enough to be seen and understood by the masses.

I agree bitcoin might be overvalued right now (and if not now then at some point in the near future) and will correct.  But that's not what defines a bubble.  A bubble is growth that is purely momentum, when it pops the underlying asset falls to its real value--zero or near zero.  I expect bitcoin to keep its value long term, hence why it's not a bubble.

I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing, I'm saying it will likely cause people to buy more (and earlier) than they would have otherwise.

The blog post is correct, there are a lot of pitfalls with bitcoin (many not even mentioned).

You need to be informed, responsible, and more than a little computer savvy to use bitcoins right now.

It's not an issue of who is making the orders, it's an issue of what price the orders are at and how much volume is at those prices.  That's what the order books shows: pending buy/sell orders at various prices.  You can see the one for bitcoin on the lower pane of the bitcoinity page.  The point I was making is a lot of volume for orders exist that don't show up in the order book, and these orders are usually the smartest money.

It's 1 BTC times the number of people you can get to join.  And as you build reputation you can increase from 1 BTC to higher amounts.

The reason why they won't is leverage. You can leverage an ETF. It's like being able to buy $2000 in bitcoins with only $1000. There is even higher leverage in options and forex when those become available. What that means to bitcoin is suddenly wall street can create what boils down to off-blockchain bitcoins. If it goes the way it went with gold wall street will create 10x or 100x or even 1000x more false bitcoins in leverage than actual bitcoins on the blockchain. Then where is your 21 million bitcoin limit? Where is honest price discovery? Wall street leverage will be driving price, not real bitcoin usage or demand.  And no, it won't necessarily mean bitcoin price goes up... in the case of gold it keeps price down.
A bitcoin ETF (and especially bitcoin going on forex) will be BAD.

People actually walked around with gold coins and stores took them.  It doesn't get more directly currency and money than that.  The paper certificates that people exchanged weren't money themselves, they were receipts for gold held somewhere--gold certificates.  Gold was both currency and money.  The paper money that exists today is very different--it's our money today that isn't money.

My number comes from wikipedia on their annual sales.  If you think it's wrong, correct it with the right value if you know so much.
But even if sales were double or triple that so what?  Bitcoin fundamentally is sound and taking off.  There is a MUCH larger market out there that is now rapidly ramping up--bitcoin doesn't need some illegal drug store.

Bitcoin is a great tool but it won't get rid of banks or end inflation.  The proof is simply to notice that gold never solved those problems.  The governments just manipulated, confiscated, and otherwise abused gold and confused the public about it until gold completely stopped being used as money.  Something similar could eventually happen to bitcoin if it were to become a common money.  If you doubt it again I point to the history of gold.

Sounds like you're unaware you can sell 0.1 of a bitcoin, or 0.001 or 0.0001 or 0.00001, etc.  So there's no practical limit on the high value in bitcoins based on it being difficult to convert back to fiat.

Bitcoin prices surpassing previous highs confirms bitcoin has recovered from previous collapse and moved beyond.  It implies bitcoin is not in a speculative bubble but is here to stay.

Realistically bitcoin has to be able to thrive despite becoming listed as a bunch of derivative products on wall street because it will probably happen regardless.  But I want people to be aware of the negatives of going that route and understand the difference between bitcoin and wall street and how they are not compatible.  It very well might be the end of the promise that bitcoin holds if it just becomes another manipulated asset on wall street.  The promise of bitcoin rests in the blockchain not wall street.  Anyone that says otherwise is looking for a quick buck or has no clue why bitcoin is revolutionary (or both).
Wall Street is a centralized, trust-based network.  It is what bitcoin aims to replace (or side step).  Supposed "bitcoins" that trade off blockchain on exchanges (wall street or otherwise) are NOT bitcoins, they are claims to bitcoin through some trusted 3rd party.  If you don't know the difference and why the difference is important you do not understand bitcoin.

Gold in your possession really can't be seized either.  You have to give it up, just like you might be compelled to give up bitcoin.

It's a lot easier to travel with millions in bitcoin than millions in physical gold.
@_date: 2013-05-31 06:15:54
It's quite easy to hide gold such that it won't be found.

For all practical purposes there would be no difference between gold and bitcoin confiscation and that was the original point.

I don't know exactly how and when we get there, but $1000 is coming.  Current market cap of around 1.2 billion is just too small for a global currency/asset like bitcoin...  even Game Stop has 4x that market cap.  
At $1000/coin market cap will be over 11 billion and becoming more respectable but still tiny for a global currency.  So anyway $1000 as a next target will be easily reached if bitcoin doesn't have some critical internal problem that comes to light.  It will take a while to get there as it takes time to build up use of bitcoin and infrastructure.

Bitcoin does not need to be backed. As evidence cosider is gold itself backed? Why isn't gold backed? Why is a near useless metal worth so much yet not backed and is itself considered solid backing for currency?  The reason is the properties of gold make it an ideal physical medium of exchange: it doesn't corrode, it can't be counterfeit, it is divisible, etc. Because of these properties  people have used it for money for thousands of years--it has intrinsic value as a medium of exchange due to its physical properties. Bitcoin also has ideal properties of money, including properties gold doesn't have that make it good for exchange online. These properties make it a great online medium of exchange in the same way gold is a good physical medium of exchange. Bitcoin already has intrinsic value for what it does and needs no backing, just as gold has no backing. It's also why bitcoin will continue higher in value closer to how gold is valued as more of the market chooses bitcoin for online exchange.

It's gonna continue shooting up like that for a while.  More ASIC miners are coming online every day.  Butterfly Labs is about to start shipping to add theirs into the mix.  GPU mining will be as pointless as CPU mining in another few months.

Not really, because this is not based on market forces.  It's artificial--what is really behind it all is the government printing the currency.  Until that stops (or collapses) the game can continue for a long time--just look at the stock market going up despite jobs, shipping, etc. not recovering.
Speculation is the symptom, the disease is fiat and goventment printing (or Quantitative Easing or whatever term they've invented for printing this week).  And of course the solution is bitcoin (or any *honest* currency system).

And I say it's not a valid point to post on Wikipedia--it's not true.  Why would anyone think it's a valid point to be made on Wikipedia?  Do you have the opposite understanding of "valid" than I do?  It's an INVALID point to be posting on Wikipedia.  But at any rate I stopped caring several hours ago.

Gox does not set price nor do exchanges "follow" Gox. Traders on all exchanges set price. Arbitrage between exchanges (done by traders) keeps prices on exchanges together.  Gox had the most trading volume so was the largest part of that, however that is rapidly changing. Arbitrage on Gox is breaking down because it's difficult to get fiat out for many traders.
Edit:  Why the downvotes?  Facts inconvenient for ya?

Tell them with bitcoin you can transfer money to Uncle Bob (or whoever) in Ireland (or where ever) instantly, securely and for near zero cost.  Compare that to the speed, cost and trouble of using Western Union or bank wires.  Ask them if  Western Union and the bank wire system are worthless.  Point out bitcoin basically replaces those systems (for just ONE thing it does) and then ask them again how worthless bitcoin is.

Maybe if the journalists owned some bitcoin they might actually get a fact or two about bitcoin correct.

Merchants do get instant transactions with bitcoin as merchant providers provide instant purchases.  The provider hides the details of the bitcoin transaction and deals with issues like confirmations and risk of double spend for merchants.

Gox is responsible for their system but regardless it's not ok to go digging through APIs to find possible exploits to screw up the underlying system.  Morally its wrong and it's illegal to boot as it's a form of denial of service attack.  It would be perfectly reasonable for Gox to ban these users for abusing their service.
I'm sure Gox will close the hole but just because there are holes doesn't make it ok to find and exploit them just as it's not ok to enter someone's house and bust up all their stuff just because a window was left unlocked.

There should be an animated tip jar... something that detects a tip and then dances or shows a stripper or something. Maybe it could even animate a slot machine and return money to the sending address if it spins a winning spin.

Yes, people could avoid debt and live cheaper but standards of living are still falling in the US and have been sice the 60's.  You're too young to remember how a guy could actually support a family pumping gas and compare that to today.  Do you suppose it was coincidence that when someone could it was when the dollar was backed by gold and quarters, dimes, etc. were minted in silver? Heh do you even know people used to make a living pumping gas?

it's on an exponential curve up and to continue the move higher it has to make impossible gains very fast. when that fails to happen it's a blow off top.  It could get ugly to the down side very fast at any time now.

Nobody is forcing you to use their service.  If you use their service you agree to their TOS.  If you don't abide by the TOS, you can be canceled.

We're now going into debt and not living within our means because that is the nature of our money system today.  It punishes saving and rewards debt and by its nature requires ever increasing amounts of debt (until it implodes).  The pathetic face of American  personal (and government) finance today is a direct reflection of our debt-based fiat money system, it is not some flaw with the people.  What has changed is our money and financial system, not our nature.  The changes in our money system are also behind the huge gap between rich and poor in the country. 
I'm not attacking you, I'm trying to educate. Talk to bitcoin early adopters... most they know this stuff and it's why they were early adopters.  They are labelled crazy by the media but they know more what is really happening and why than most anyone.
