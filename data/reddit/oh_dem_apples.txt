Yes, also let me know what company they hire to implement said chain so I can buy the shit outta that stock.

But I need everyone to send me bitcoins. Seriously though, thank you for the response. That makes sense. The part of getting my debit card verified has been annoying as only one of the charges have shown up the past two times I've tried it (over 4 days time) but I understand they're having a huge uptick in traffic on the site.

Those are good points. I'm certainly in the Hodl camp, I just want to play around with ~$100. It's fairly naive to think that I can outmanuver professional traders but I know me and since I'm stubborn I'm limiting myself to a small amount.

Wait...what? Do you think people are just handing out coins or something lol. What am I missing here. Honestly not being a douche, btw happy birthday.

Something something, the real post is always in the comments.

Okay so the taxes for trading here is the same as the traditional stock market, thank you for that info. I know I could just google this, and I will, but is there any language is the tax bill that is being worked on that plans to decrease those %'s?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:28:56
Oh okay I didn't know that at all. I'm just trying to get oriented to the UI. Thanks for letting me know that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:32:54
Thank you for that. I'll definitely take a look.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:54:51
I am completely ignorant of the tax regulations as of right now so I appreciate you're advice. Any trading I will be doing is going to be of minimal significance ($5-$10) until I feel comfortable. Taxes are on a growing list of homework I have assigned myself.

Yeah....buddy. Geez, that guy.

Posse Veterans Program  This helps talented veterans break through the gatekeeping of Ivy League and elite universities. I was accepted to this program and I can't tell you enough how much of a life changer it is. So far they are partnered with Dartmouth, Wesleyan, Vassar, and the University of Virginia with supposedly many more coming on board. Funding is crucial however.

I completely understand that logic, but the price rise never seems to be completely linear over a 24hr period. It always seems to bounce. I'm aware that it's much easier to say that then catch it at the right time however. As for the taxes, I'm not near well enough versed to make a comment on that. I do know that for the US on GDAX if you make a limit order there are no transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:32:28
Wow, that was fucking cool to read.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:51:13
And by making thousands of microtransactions the lower the overall % of fees that they pay over a 30 day span? According to the fee schedule I saw on GDAX that seems to be correct, please let me know if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:07:34
This is really spot on. There have been some courses like this developed  but if someone has something in the fire that could catch on like EdX's CS50 it would be immensely popular.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:55:30
No worries man. I'm new as well so please research a better source than me, but most of the exchanges like Gdax, Kraken and others have a huge backlog registering new users right now so it might take a few days to buy. Also, I don't know trashed is for you but I would not set up a wallet while hammered lol. YMMV though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:16:17
Right but on GDAX if you're doing a Limit Order and select the "post-only" option, there is no fee because it is a Maker Order not a Taker Order, at least that's what I gather from the "Trading Rules" section on the GDAX website.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:16:36
Maybe I'm missing something. The only thing on the right is the price chart, correct? I understand that the "scrolling transactions" are trades.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:05:55
Dilly dilly!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:48:34
Lol yeah I didn't mean specific to crypto, that would be nuts. More along the lines of lowering capital gains tax in regards to trading in general. Interesting times my friend!
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:29:44
I have questions. I know I'm going to get slammed and that's okay. Anyway, here it goes.
1. Could the current small dip (10:22 am EST) be due to large investors trying to drive the market down to then buy back in at a lower point in anticipation of futures starting tonight?
2. Why would trading on GDAX be difficult to make small profits on? I completely understand HODL but I also have some that I want to play around with just to get oriented. With the rather large swings day to day, shouldn't it be fairly easy to, for example, buy at $19,500 then sell at $19,700. Wait  for it to dip to $19,600, buy back in, then sell again at $19,900. That seems easy to do from watching all the charts on GDAX. Is it just the time it takes for the order to fill that throws a wrench into this line of thinking?
Anyway thanks in advance for feedback and soul crushing burns.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:03:47
I really wonder if this is just whales driving the price down so they can get in at a lower price point so they have greater margins when the futures start trading and the price really jumps.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:35:53
You make good points. As a noob I would add that being respectful and appreciative of people taking the time to answer your questions is very important. Being brand new and coming in complaining about how hard it is to learn, or that getting verified is taking forever will probably not yield positive results. You dont have to like people's responses but you can be thankful they took the time. I'm only saying this because I've had plenty of experience being the new guy (military, college, jiu-jitsu). It's amazing how much people will tell you if you just listen.

Has anyone here dabbled with investing in startups that are focusing on blockchain tech? I know major companies like IBM are doing their own thing, but there is undoubtedly room for startups in this space. Slightly off topic so I apologize if this should be posted somewhere else.
