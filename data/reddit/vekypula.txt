It would be true if it was monero. Bitcoin transactions are written on a public ledger rofl, killing tech.

Just buy monero
Nobody in their right would like all of their transactions being visible on a public ledger , forever.
@_date: 2019-11-16 22:04:13
How is monero centralised and how do you ban monero?

The analogy is wrong. You cant compare 1000000 of something to 1 of something else
