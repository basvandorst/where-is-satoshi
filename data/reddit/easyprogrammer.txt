Eth spam mania. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:21:53
It is very unfortunate.

Exactly, they flush money to scare people and then they buy to make 100x more money than they flushed. Now ruger LIAR var has a shitload of money thanks to Bitcoin and he uses that to attack Bitcoin spamming the network with bots. Remember, high fees disappeared as soon as people agreed with rugers vision. When they changed their mind because of obvious reasons the spam started again and the fees increased.Until now. Now the spam seems done, maybe the liar ran out of money to pay for the bots :))

Upvoted. I hope no one lose money.

It has many uses for many people. It's logic.

I will post this video on my blog started this month and I will point to your channel.
LE: Sorry, I got to the part where you promote coinbase. I'm against centralized exchanges so I won't post the video. If you want the link to two decentralized exchanges send me a message or check out my post about it. It's here, somewhere, not sure where because I did not see it :(

Bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is the first and at least until it reaches the cap it will only grow long term. Daily there will be ups and downs of different dimensions. People like to make money. Bitcoin will be upgraded, it just needs some time. It is and it will be the best.

Yes, 10 months is very likely, BeurreDePinotte :)
Bitcoin is a store of value better than gold and it's also electronic cash. It will reach 1 million, maybe 1 billion :)

I am glad for you. I wish we all did that thing back in the day but I am always happy when I see a person who was smart enough to do it and keep the stuff until now and even further. TO MARS AND BEYOND!

The article is a lie. Check this out... 
Bitcoin is so little compared to other search terms... Bitcoin just got more searched than trump recently... Check it out.

Watch the video, it's not what I meant... I meant that decentralized exchanges are the future not asking for your data like electricity bill and the turning them over to US government, it cannot be taken down because it's peer to peer like torrent or Bitcoin. Many other reasons, watch the video bro. Coinbase it's not going down but the sooner people start using peer to peer exchanges the better for them. Yes, I'm new user, so what? In 2 months I will be older user. Again, so what? You were new at some point (two months ago) and everybody else... I just gave you an awesome information, if you want to use it early like the early adopters used Bitcoin, good for you. If not, still good for you. At some point you will make the switch, whether it's now or in 20 years.

Those are examples, below you have links where you can try any company. It's a chart of how much were those keywords searched on google. 100 means max in the chart. Check how not mainstream is Bitcoin compared to almost anything. If Bitcoin becomes mainstream the market cap will rise a lot.

Guys, just create a random account with a random password and you will be safe. I will post the link on my blog. Thank you for this mtl1234.

In my country 90% of all people do the search instead of typing the url.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:08:41
I am using Firefox and duckduckgo for searches. Still, you are right, Google in reality is much higher than Facebook. But Facebook is much higher than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not yet mainstream. It's just in infancy. We will speak in 2-3 years when it will be more mainstream. Indeed Bitcoin gained some traction this year but keep in mind, gold marked cap is over 4 trillion $ What if Bitcoin gets there or even 1/4? Of course, the developers have to implement lightning as soon as possible to get there as soon as possible.

Blockchain and Bitcoin are both awesome! That guy will cry in 10 years because he did not buy now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:02
Why? Watch the whole video and you will see! The price is about to rise again big time. If you do not invest now you will lose. We will talk in 1 week to 1 month. I will have a happy new year because I will cash in some of my profits. What will you do? I gave as argument the whole video, you just say I am retarded without a reason. What does that mean about you?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:11:53
Am I still retarded bro? BTC is 19k$ :)
