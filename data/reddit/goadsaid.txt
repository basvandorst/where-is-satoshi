Honestly, this just motivates me even more to rally against BCH. I help numerous older people get into crypto and never once have I gotten them a BCH. Now I will make sure to also let them know what a scam it is. All you really have to do is watch Roger Ver speak to know he's as scummy as they come.

You lose funds because you send Bitcoin to a wallet that's actually a Btrash wallet because there's no way for a newbie to know because they are calling Btrash Bitcoin and Bitcoin - Bitcoin "legacy". It's needlessly and maliciously confusing.

No. That was a generic use of "you". I wasn't referring to OP but rather the larger crypto community. Tron isn't a Goldman Sachs crypto but it's all hype based on the founder (Justin Sun) supposedly being related to someone high up at Alibaba. However, what those people fail to mention is that someone (presumable Justin but he denies it) dumped 20 billion Tron for Ethereum when Tron hit like .28. Tron is pump and dump hype epitomized.

Isn't it possible (if the China fud is  true) that Btrash will fuck off and go away? Because aren't like all of their miners in China? Also, if not, won't any decrease in China miners slow Btrash to a crawl? I haven't really found any saying this but it seems logical to me.

There's definitely promising projects, I was obviously being reductive. With that said, the majority of projects are still trash. Monero probably has a future. Maybe XLM. Maybe Vechain and EOS. Most suck though.

Btc (and Eth) are the only cryptos with legitimate interests. You can shill your Tron all day. My money stays where there's history and a track record (and developers) - in BTC.

I took my alts and put them all in BTC now. These waves are becoming ridiculously predictable. BTC will rise now. Alts will fall. Rinse and repeat. 
And the truth is - no one is trading to get more Tron. They take their shitcoin profits and run to BTC and ETH just like you and me.

Shit still. It's like Gold and turds. Just because gold gets validity as jewelry doesn't mean you can just wrap turds around your neck and it's the same thing.

How did this even happen? If Miley Sirus said "eminem's new song is holysmokes hot", "holysmokeshot.com" would be unavailable 35 seconds later. Considering that techies (internet folk) are behind Bitcoin, how is Bitcoin.com fake?

As far as I can see, ETF futures for Bitcoin will be something for ONLY the super rich can take part in because you will probably be forced to escrow huge sums of money at your broker to cover a potential 20k loss on a futures contract. Like you said, if it goes from 7k to 20k and you were shorting it, there is a lot of distance to cover which they aren't going to trust that you pay them a little later. They're going to want 50% extra in your escrow with them, ready to pay them for those losses. Normal futures contracts involve ordinary stocks... which, relative to BTC, have like no volatilty so people do leverage or margins trading with them to up the stakes. Banks lend you 10:1 leverage and then pull you out once your own capital is eaten by losses. With BTC, it seems like you would need to lend them that capital (almost anti-leverage money) to cover the same capital losses that your initial deposit would cover in traditional stocks leveraged futures trading. But, like I said, I'm no expert and I could definitely be wrong.

Exactly. To me it seems obvious that they would manipulate the market since Bitcoin is anonymous and they can pump and dump and HODL to mold the markets to everyone of their big futures products. It seems more likely actually that they would manipulate BTC than other financial instruments because they can get away with it since BTC is anonymous. If they have a long futures contract they want to pay off, why not pump Bitcoin up by buying lots of it and then buy even more of it (at a steep discount) when they execution date for the long futures option  comes along and then sell it for undeserved profits? Rinse and repeat.
If they are able to secretly manipulate BTC with anonymous entries and exits, to fulfill futures wins for themselves, the only thing left to do would be trade through them because their wins are absolute... which means BTC is just like every other stock. I want to know how this can be stopped.
