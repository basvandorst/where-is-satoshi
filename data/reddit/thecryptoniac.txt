Good points! I like the way you end it "It’s all about what sells, which is sadly often whatever triggers strong negative emotions." So true!
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:08:45
Media is always reporting what they are told to report
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:14:23
100% truth has been spoken!
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:28:39
Yes, it will and this time it will not stop at 20K 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:33:51
I am sorry you feel this way, I did not intend for this, just how my voice is...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:23
Its not an advice just my personal opinion, I sated to do your own research before investing :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:33:04
well, lets see...
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:47:39
pretty much how it will go from now on
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:46
Only History will tell
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:40:51
lets keep it there for a while
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:56
Becasue its not , major crush happened to altcoins a few weeks back, this is just BTC correcting, altcoins have not lost much value in the past few hours 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:47:15
hope it slows down a little so we can buy more
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:46:34
true that, but it needs to stabilize a little before the rise so we can accumulate :P 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:56
exactly but still DYOR I always advice that 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:15:36
yes we are indeed in the bottom , but this will escalate way faster than any other trend out there
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:29:31
They are in to panic, Banks are seen clients fleeing..
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:55
or 9 times 2000 :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:05
I think it has essential info for the newcomers to understand what is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:45:36
indeed it is , when it hits 100,000 still will be undervalued 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:17:16
King only rests...
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:22:15
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:54
Seriously? Did you even bothered to watch it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:24
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:31
lol that was the cause not to hold at 10K a while back :P
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:04
Soon to be 20K
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:50
Great input, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:16
That too :P
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:15:25
Sorry about that, made a mistake on editing I had an example from Bitforex with wash-trading orders happening  
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:15:15
will do :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:29:36
there are a lot of money that will shift, money are out there
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:16:02
You are not the only one :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:29
Any Cryptoccurency which has a solid project is a good investment, because we are in the beginning
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:49:23
Seriously? Inflation will affect prices as well. we need t adjust it since $10 will not have the same buying power in 10 years. Probably you will need 12-13 to buy the same things.
Same with Bitcoin price it will have to worth more...
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:06:32
No I just say that every day more money are been generated and I see that Cryptoccurency market cap can reach if not surpass the value of Stock markets. Money do not have necessary to come directly from stock markets. I dont see any decline on stock markets since Cryptocurrencies got in to our lives.. Both can continue growing but obviously crypto market has much more space to do so..
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:03:01
Coins essentially will be like stocks. Some of the coins have companies behind them as well
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:15:46
Not exactly, I just analyze a potential growth. More money are invested every day in to botch Stock exchanges and Crypto.
Cryptocurrencies are the future, also take in ot consideration inflation, it can even be higher...
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:10
Yep, true that it will take a while but it will get there
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:03:34
true that, keeping an eye on arising opportunities is always the way to go. But the market with every ICO is growing
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:04:11
But it is combined because Cryptoccurencies trade worldwide
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:30:07
No it is not...it is more than that 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:49:08
True I misread the article, my fault 
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:14:00
haha, idiots, they will learn one day  
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:20:31
Well I was screaming about that a month ago :
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:21:30
And soon they will triple and so on, we know what is coming 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:53:29
100% it is !
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:43:33
That is true, Bitcoin is the future 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:36:46
100%, Been like Tom always pays off
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:25:27
I misread the article , my mistake 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:45:47
Well not exactly 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:50:29
banning google ads is not going to hurt crypto, if it does on thing it will help it
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:45:07
Just feel bad for the people sold under 7K 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:22:25
80% of those coins will not exist in 5 years
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:28:24
Well Amazon will follow soon 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:37:20
Still on Green!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:37:08
It was always like this, long term investor always wins 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:44:23
That's a comment! You got an up vote my fiend haha
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:00
You can buy a whole foods card and than buy staff, one step before the full accepting 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:23:24
Thats is not very smart, his education will cost a fortune in a few years when BTC is around 100-500K
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:48:45
I have used them as well! But I hate giving my BTC away...
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:35:04
Well no one should invest money they cant afford to loose, but Banks shouldn't have issued credit cards to people cant afford pay them off...so it goes deeper than that 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:43:01
Calling Bitcoin a bubble is just idiotic, lets move form that 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:41:53
True, but still, you can buy the products through the card that was bought through Bitcoin
