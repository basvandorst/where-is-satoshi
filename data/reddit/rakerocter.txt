Governments don't give anybody anything (that the don't first take from someone else, while wasting most of it on bureaucratic shipping and handling costs).  It is governments that are the parasites that steal the fruits of the peoples' labor.  It is governments that put everyone in perpetual debt slavery with their corrupt and illegal mismanagements of money.  It is governments that reward the banksters for ruining the financial system and thereby peoples' lives.  It is because of governments that bitcoin becomes so necessary and valuable.  Fuck the AUS government and the ATO and all the rest.
@_date: 2015-12-12 15:48:37

Zerohedge is actually one of the best blogs on REAL financial news, in my opinion - and quite aligned with the views of most in the bitcoin crowd.  They do have an unusually vocal (for lack of a better word) comment crowd though.

You're not understanding his statement at all, much less the free market.  What you're saying is so unwise.  If regulation worked, JP Morgan would have gone the way of Mt. Gox.  But as it is, we're left with JP Morgan.  The Bitcoin market killed Mt. Gox; the regulated market keeps the likes of JP Morgan alive and thieving.

You're speculating as to what "fuels" him.  His comments actually are quite sensible.  
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:39:36
These people who apply Occam's Razor to things:  It isn't absolutely true.  It is qualified by the words *usually*, etc.  But people try to be smart and say that the "simplest explanation" is the true one because of Occam's Razor.  Sure, *sometimes*, even *usually*, but **not always**.  In other words, sometimes the explanation is complicated.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:56:35
If you think he wrote that to prop up the value of BTC, you just don't get it and probably never will.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:04:08
Exactly.  Getting a little tired of the urgent sanctimonious undercurrent of things here lately.  Maybe it is to be expected in a community of libertarian-minded people - that their differences are always getting in the way.
EDIT:  I consider myself as libertarian as anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:32:54
what makes you think he volunteered for it?  they contacted him after reading his post yesterday.  
if they had interviewed someone else, and reported it the same irresponsible way, and that person complained, would you have the same problem with them as you do with voorhees?
many people care what voorhees thinks.  open your eyes.  he's helped a lot of us get involved with and understand bitcoin.  
it sounds like your judgement and perceptions are clouded for some reason.

sometimes they're more likely to haul people away who no one knows about.  so no one cares when they're locked up for rest of their lives.  so, for cody wilson, it could be argued that it's in his best interest to be as public a figure as he can be, so that the state will be much more reluctant to disappear him for all the noise it will generate.

Ben Lawsky, thanks for screwing things up.  
Go get a job where you can apply yourself to the betterment of society and your fellow man instead of standing in the way of progress and the ability of people to increase their standard of living.  You serve the backwards interests of your corrupt Wall Street masters, who rightly see bitcoin as a big threat to their kleptocratic ways.

ok. that makes some sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:23:06
Why isn't the Bitcoin world in more of an outrage about Mt. Gox?  They're hurting Bitcoin immensely, though it will recover.  The sooner they go away, the better.  Granted, the situation is more complicated.  But everything having to do with Mt. Gox is bad, aside from the fact that they were there at the beginning and played an important role in the inception.  But their time is up.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:17:14
Not really. It's only a video of remarks he made publicly. Enough sanctimony. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:19:19
Wow.  That's pretty much the opposite of volunteering.  The reporter sought him out, not the other way around.

Thanks, but we'll take our chances.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:50:23
if the article is about BITCOIN only, then why interview voorhees?  if you interview voorhees, then communicate accurately what HE said.  get a clue.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:17:04
And those comments are "crazy" how?  Go out on a limb and explain it to us.  Do you expect us just to be cool and follow the herd and swallow that?
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:22:09
Sure, but the reporter should distill the interview down into a few representative quotes instead of one very miss-representative quote, as was the cae with Voorhees. Orherwise, it is not journalism because they are not conveying accurately. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:42:58

@_date: 2014-02-28 01:36:53
Thanks.  I agree with your point.
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:14:19
It's pretty dumb to throw out an explanation just because it's complicated.  Go where the evidence takes you, examine all possibilities and probabilities, keep conclusions provisional until you know for sure....  Don't apply Occam's Razor as a shortcut, because per se, it doesn't mean anything is less or more true when examining each individual case.  **It *only* applies *generally*, and *after* the fact.**
If you're really talking probabilities, then my comment wasn't for you.  The fact that I said *usually* should have conveyed to you that I might understand it's about probabilities.  A lot of people dismiss complicated explanations because of "Occam's Razor".
Taking it further, Occam's Razor applies even less when considering malevolent or devious people (Karpeles) and their actions than it does to impersonal phenomena.

@_date: 2014-02-26 14:15:05
Amazed that so many are still giving Karpeles a benefit of doubt.  I guess the lack of answers and clarity makes them suspend judgement and they don't yet want to get angry at the guy who lost their money. It's almost like they don't actually want to hear officially that their bitcoin are definitely gone for good. 
And could it be that Gox were stealing from themselves? Haven't heard this point raised. Why didn't they fix the maleability issue sooner? 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:01:35

I agree with you 100% about the control thing.  
I'm as libertarian as anyone, and I've noticed first-hand in libertarian circles that there isn't a willingness to "get along" for the "greater good" - one of the reasons I generally like libertarianism.  Liberty means that differences are OK.  Whereas in most other party politics, differences are to be squelched or denied or otherwise not allowed.  So libertarians necessarily have more difficulty uniting or organizing.  Although, it is somewhat easier around singular items like Bitcoin or End the Fed, for instance.  Anyway, I realize I'm diverting a bit from the topic of the OP.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:15:14

I'm saying that Mt. Gox per se, right now, is doing far more harm than good, and I wish they would go away soon.  They have already de-valued the bitcoin price a lot.  So many of us have already lost value, for the time being.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:56:34
that may happen often, but that's not journalism.
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:14:56
This makes another case for renewable energy, particularly wind energy, maybe even distributed wind energy at the mining locations.  Eventually, distributed wind energy costs will be low enough that it would make sense to include a small wind energy system as part of a mining operation investment.
Before government subsidies, utility-scale wind energy *costs* about $0.037-0.04/kWh ($37-40/MWh), cheaper than so-called "conventionals".  See [this study]( particularly the graph on p.2.
