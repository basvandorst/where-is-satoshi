I don't think so, ETH beats Bitcoin in TPS 
(transactions per second) 
BTC TPS is 3
ETH TPS is 20
Ripple XRP TPS 1500
IOTA TPS 1000 
You can't buy a cup of coffee with BTC or ETH the fee is higher from the transaction because the miners charge a fee to verify transactions, with Ripple they use machine learning technically and it's a small fee of $0.003, IOTA if feeless, every time you do a transaction you verify 2 other people's transactions it takes seconds and the computer does the back end work.

In 8-12 year's all coins will be mined

Blockshave mining technically is expensive and cost lots of money, Ripple XRP and IOTA Tangle is the future

At the rate of mining this year it will all be mined in 12 year's

There is so much politics because of mining blockchains, Ripple XRP or IOTA don't use mining, that allows for faster nearly free or free transactions, and stability, Bitcoin can go up or down with 20% in one day, and then there's the whole issue about forks that results of free money coins, at some point after some more forks it will devalue the original Bitcoin it will become smaller coins and other coins will pass it.

But groups of miners pools, control now days most of the transactions and change rules, resulting in forks, Bitcoin was supposed to be completely decentralized with miniers in control it takes away the decentralization 
IOTA Solves this issue, no miners, feeless translations complete decentralization

Collo1989 don't be a internet bully we all have our own research and we all speculate the future, I raise valid points about BTC
