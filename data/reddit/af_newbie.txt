Your 5 minutes of fame has passed.  Move on.  Who cares what you think?  You left bitcoin, remember?

changing a header file constant is not a solution.
It is moving the problem 6-12 months into the future at the expense of a hard fork.  
Ask yourself this: Is it worth it to do a hard fork and end up with no solution.  Otherwise you will end up having hard forks every few months.
Bitcoin was not meant to handle large number of transactions.  Even with 32MB blocks you'll not be handling more than 100 transactions per second.  Nowhere near the VISA numbers.
People who think bitcoin can handle 7000 tx/sec have not read the code.

Core is the only way to move forward.  Slow growth, tested releases.  No hard forks.
But hashing power brokers will decide how to risk their capital.  Personally, I think slow growth is the way to go, but Gavin &amp; Garzik, Cole types want growth and profits...

You realize that the issue is not the block size, right?
Core long stood to preserve Satoshi's initial vision of independent, decentralized crypto currency.  Bitcoin was never meant to replace Paypal or VISA.  Why would it?  Both work quite well.
Without the original vision, bitcoin will be competing with Ethereum and others for fast blocks, TPS capacity.  Guess who will win this battle.
Without Core bitcoin is done, IMHO.  Ethereum and other private (JP Morgan's) blockchains will feed on bitcoin carcass.
I'm surprised people who were smart enough to invest money and time into bitcoin fail to understand it.

That laptop might not be enough once blocks get bigger.  But before you run out of space, you will use up all the data transfer quota you have.  Once you get a bill for each 1GB in overage, you'll know why some people say it is too early to allow for block size increase.  Technology/infrastructure to support block size increase is not cheap enough to allow for such increase without hurting decentralization.

That is a great idea.  Vote with your wallet.  Then add up all the coins 'for' and 'against' the motion....
Essentially each satoshi is a voting ballot.
Nobody can fake their votes.

Overtime, private blockchains (government or corporate) will  be a common artifact. Just like relational databases today.
I'm surprised db software companies have not incorporated blockchains into their db products yet.  But I guess that might be something they are working on as we speak.

This should be a warning to all those morons that want larger block size.
BTW, check your configuration.  You can limit peer connections.
