Also network effect, comparatively high liquidity (far more attractive to big money), intriguing back story (who is Satoshi Nakamoto?), ostensibly brilliant development team with a long term outlook, media exposure... Bitcoin has a lot going for it despite its current failings as a micro-payment system.

Yeah I'm with you! I think if you can stand back and appreciate the high drama and its implications then it's super exciting. But gosh if it doesn't give me low-key anxiety, having recently fallen down the rabbit hole and traded some of my old coins for some of these new ones.
I've learnt much about and kept tabs on Bitcoin through this subreddit, so have been feeling anti-S2X... But who's to say if I hadn't initially clicked on r/btc and stayed there I'd have the opposite outlook? Kind of a Sliding Doors scenario. And as much as I may read up on this issue, I'm still a layman with the wrong sort of background to make a judgement or prediction I can rigorously support.
If anything, though, I've also become disenfranchised re the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. At least with this iteration. That large mining pools and exchanges exist and are able to rally and conceivably make changes speaks against that.
I think, come the fork, I'll be on the fence and won't sell my B2X coins. It seems some people on this subreddit will do so ideologically. But to me that feels like hubris. I just hope the right side, whichever that is, prevails.
