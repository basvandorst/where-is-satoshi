How do you mean from 3 sellers?  a buy order is a buy order,  you don't get to choose who/how many sellers,  the market determines that.  Anywhoo, off topic.    if someone cancels their sell order (which is what you say happened)  then your buy order would sit unfulfilled and Cdn $ in escrow, unless you cancel the order.    Sounds to me like you did nothing wrong, and it is their trade engine that f*cked up.
