Quite true. Happened with me too in India. BTC prices soared to $19K. Many did not pay heed to my advice of not buying. They regret, react, fret and go into a shell, showering abuses on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has trends which can be measured and that is what I tried to bring in this article.

I don't understand?

:) Bitcoin has been declared dead many times. It has seen many ups and downs in the past 10 years. Someone in a closed group in India made a similar remark saying Bitcoin is being beaten to death...and that gave me the idea of the title - that despite seeing crazy ups and downs, despite being beaten to death many times, this resilient currency still lives on!!

Thanks for your feedback. Much appreciate. Just tried to bring the facts with some easy analysis on the table which many might not know. Actually, I wrote this article after some discussion in a closed group about the price fluctuations and someone commented that it did not make sense to buy bitcoins.

Oh wow!! A Bitcoin Funded trip. I am sure you would love to record your trip.

I was thinking of writing to you about the use of M-Pesa. But I am sure you would have figured it out. All the best for the trip!!

My using the word democracy is not related to the politics of it. There is no voting for sure. In that manner, democracy may not be the word. But apart from voting or being the ruling or decision making party, isn't "having a choice" democratic? The node is oblivious to the word "democracy" and runs the code as per the algorithm...but those who own the node have the choice to run it or not. Plus those who support Bitcoin Core have the right to  "suggest" a change or accept one. Arriving at a consensus, in many ways, becomes sort of a vote for the suggested change...Only then does the change become part of the code, which again is a democratic way to solve a problem or effect a change!
However, having said that - you have summarized the essence of Bitcoin in a great straightforward manner. Not that I have not read or known all this...but I learnt a better way of expressing the system today. Thanks!!
" I’m not trying to be harsh or toxic. " - No worries. This is a discussion forum and we are passionately discussing something. You are passionate about it..I have done it sometimes too!!  :)

The system is consensus-driven, for sure. But the democratic nature comes from the fact that the power is with the user. The power to participate, suggest a change, earn and create something new!!
