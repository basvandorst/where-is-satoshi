Do you usually wait for some dips to happen before buying or do you buy there and then once you have the funds?
I'm still on the accumulating phase, and I'm not sure whether to wait for even just a few hundred $ of dip or buy early for fear of rising trend. I assume it depends on how good you can read the market?

Not seeing any upside trend in the short term as well. Both Bakkt and halvening take time to make BTC appreciate in price, and I'm on the camp who thinks that crypto is not ready yet to be store of value on recession.
Therefore, just buy it while it's still cheap and hodl for the next year at least. This is not a get rich fast scheme; you gotta be committed to invest in this asset class.

I was looking into BTC purchase through Gemini API due to its lower fee and stumbled upon this guideline:  [reddit post]( Is this recommended and/or safe to do? I have hardware wallet to use, but I don't know how secure it is when I need to edit the api text file with Gemini's api key and secret. Not much traffic in gemini reddit for me to ask

Another get-rich-quick victim right here.

These dips are why setting limits is so delicious. Set limit buy a couple hundred below the current price, DCA by the end of the week if it hasn't been triggered yet. Stable enough strategy for me.
