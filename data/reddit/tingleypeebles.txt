Just out of curiosity how old is your son? To introduce him to the concept maybe you can help him get a wallet and then take a tour of the faucets and build up a few satochis for fun. You can always invest a few bucks at a later date. Is your wife aware that most kids are still buying drugs with cash these days, lol?

I just signed up with cointrader. You can hook up your bank account if they dyour bank does debit online (mine doesn't unfortunately). They also partner with a service called vogogo which connects your bank account, it takes a few days to verify, I had to give id because some of my personal info was lost by the Canadian government (long story) so I have a note on my credit report that requires me to do extra verification. I'm not sure if it's standard or not.
If you want to trade, cavirtex seems busier but I've heard some mixed reviews about them.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is owned by NO government. Bitcoin is a currency owned by the people.

Yes I'm Canadian and I have an account with Circle I can buy with credit card,  around 4.5 btc max per week.  There is a fee on the credit card though,  maybe an extra 20-25 $ so it's not optimal but good in a pinch I guess.
I just got a friend signed up though and she couldn't find the add a cc option so I'm not sure what's up with that it was only giving her the option to add a bank account.  Maybe they have changed the rules since I signed up.
