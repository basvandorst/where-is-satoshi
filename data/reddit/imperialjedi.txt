In fairness you probably hold the minimum amount in your bank each month to avoid fees. But really I don't just mean a monthly bank account fee or those pesky ATM fees, I mean all fees associated with any type of financial transaction. I live in Canada and essentially everything online is priced in USD, so I get hit with a whack of silly international fees and currency conversion fees when I buy stuff online. I can obviously buy stuff that is priced in Canadian dollars and that would ship from Canada, but the majority of those same items are much cheaper in USD, even after the conversion. It's just frustrating - this is kind of what I meant when I said I was fed up. 
You are absolutely right that the average Joe doesn't use Bitcoin, but I think that's largely because they haven't heard about it yet. I will also agree that the whole buying/selling process is complicated, but I'm sure as time goes by the process will become smoother. I see that as the largest adoption barrier. I would love to see a process similar to buying prepaid gift cards at grocery stores and convenience stores, or if they become a point of sale merchant themselves. 
As a store of wealth, a lot of things performed poorly this past year. I got into BTC in the $200's, so this is still all gravy. Though the amount I invested won't get me rich, I just spend some here and there whenever the price jumps up. I even couldn't care less if the price remains stagnant - it's more the option to cut out banks from buying things because I can save money on the transaction. Everything adds up. Over the past 5 years, BTC has been an insanely good investment - so it's all about perspective. Also, I know this is lame, but 1 BTC still = 1 BTC, so it's still there, just relative to other currencies it went down, and with any investment there's risk. This is just like digital gold speculating. Plus, all currencies have volatility. If you're a trader you dream for this type of action.
Hypothetically if we woke up tomorrow and Bitcoin is the new world currency there will be a shift in wealth yes, but if people converted their fiat to BTC then over time it would gain value because of the fixed amount of coins versus money being overprinted and inflation running rampant. So yes the poor will still be poor, but at least they won't be getting poorer.
I also don't get why you just want to pick apart everything I try to say? I don't like the current financial system, Bitcoin has sparked an interest and all I want to do now is learn more about it and really anything related to money and finance. So again, I'm not an expert. 
I'm young and the world is fucked, sorry for seeking alternatives.

@_date: 2014-01-28 15:29:05
I'm not necessarily looking to get rich of this, I just want to extend my buying power a little and hopefully not dwindle what little cash I have in the bank through fees.
I'm not trying to discredit banks, I'm just saying that they take greater risk now than they did before and it's costing people money as a result. Fees keep going up with banks and they keep posting higher profits, it's just getting frustrating. 
I really don't mean to shill, I'm just passionate for change but ill informed. I genuinely am trying to learn about all of this, it's just very very new.

@_date: 2014-12-23 22:10:38
Fine, I won't live in a world of extremes, I won't use the word inevitable - but I'm extremely confident that Bitcoin will work. Once you understand what Bitcoin is and the potential behind it, it's hard not to think that it will succeed. Whatever, time will tell. I'm willing to wait it out. 
I see it simply as this, it's a digital world so why don't we have a digital currency?
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:28:57
I 1000% agree. 
My simple solution to that would be to accept them in a country that effectively bans it in a black market style environment and then transfer them to money in a country that does and bring money back to your home country. 
Of course if all governments make it illegal, then yes bitcoin would be useless. But at a $12B market cap now, that's starting to become a real number. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:23:48

Listen in all fairness I don't think anyone could have foreseen the Mt. Gox fiasco. The fallout from that is really what shook people's confidence and left the price stagnant. But the dust has settled and there's enough global uncertainty again that people are looking for alternate investment avenues as well as a racially new way to go out their daily business. 
So who knows right!?
Plus, nothing wrong with getting a little giddy with excitement. I mean, come on, Bitcoins - they're the bees knees! 
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:26:55
There's a lot of places that accept BTC legitimately. But I do get what you mean. 
At this point though I believe the market cap to be too high to just collapse, there's enough mainstream interest in this now.

The company might not be shut down if they're operating in a country that has BTC friendly transfer laws, in theory the company would just be sending FIAT to the receiving company after processing the BTC for them.

Alright fine here we go, 
I see Bitcoin as a solution to everyday financial problems. In lamest terms the average person loses a substantial amount of money to the system through user fees - Bitcoin can substantially reduce that loss while still serving the same purpose as a currency or a store of wealth. I would love to save more money by the end of the year. I'd be doing that if the majority of my transactions were done with BTC, I mean who wouldn't?
If you think that the average Joe won't care, then you're wrong. People care about their money, banks fees alone are enough to get people riled up. Imagine if your employer suddenly gave you the option to be paid in BTC, that would be sweet - imagine if you could go one step further and just cut the bank right out for your everyday transactions. Just think of how much money you'd save. Everything is always about money and if you find a relatively simple way to save people money I arguable say that the majority would logically give it a try. 
You're right about the cultish attitude, I can't help that - I just get too excited. 
I guess saying that Bitcoin is inevitable might be a bit extreme, but in reality the system that we have now is creating a huge divide financially between people. Something has to happen - inflation is killing the world, value is dying. 
Anyway, I'm not an expert, I'm just some guy who's fucking fed up. 
*edit: spelling.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:57:46
That's what I was thinking too. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:49:36
Big business yes would be cautious to accept it in a physical store, but they're online store would accept it. TigerDirect is a good example of this. 
Don't forget too that when a business accepts it, they can use a third party company that would process the conversion of BTC to FIAT and not have to accept actual BTCs. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:32:55
That's a clever idea.

If a central government tries to ban or regulate Bitcoin they are simply opening to the door for a blackmarket situation. Regardless of what you might think, people will very happily take Bitcoin over cash.
However, if governments fully support Bitcoin and find a way to integrate it into everyday purchases and find a way to generate tax revenue off those purchases then everybody wins.

I use localbitcoins without any issues, I use the cash deposit option. I just go to their bank and deposit into their account, the bitcoins are held in escrow (make sure you look for a seller that offers that) after the bank transaction the coins are released - all super fast and you don't even have to meet face to face. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:02:11
Honestly, just be happy that they gave you something back. I've heard nothing but bad things about BFL, so while they're definitely short changing you here, I don't think there's a whole heck of a lot that you could do that wouldn't end up costing you more than you could collect. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:53:29
Honestly I get that we might just have a repeat of this past year - but in the grand scheme that's not the worst thing. There were plenty of chances for Bitcoin to just drop off the map and go the way of the dinosaur, but it didn't. It's sill alive and kicking, and realistically the price could have plummeted to single digit numbers, but it didn't. There's too many people that see value at or around the price that it's at now. I feel like rock bottom has been hit and this is the turn around point. 
If I'm wrong, smeh. 
If I'm right, fucking A. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:03:34
In a nutshell you'll need the following to get started: 
1. Wallet, which is exactly as it sounds - somewhere to store your Bitcoins. Use blockchain.info for that. 
2. A means to exchange cash to bitcoin. There's quite a few different ways. Some are easier than others, just depends on what country you live in. But there's exchanges where you can buy and trade coins or sites that are setup like Craigslist where you can meet people and buy. Localbitcoins.com 
3. Somewhere to spend them! Some places offer discount if you pay with BTC. Or you can hold on to them and speculate on the price and spend them later type deal. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:22:58
Exactly, +1
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:09:07

@_date: 2014-01-28 15:23:52
People want BTC, plain and simple. If you don't want it don't buy it or use it. But I think it's at the point where it's not going away. 
With transactions, I can still see that a transaction has started even without the necessary confirmations to complete it. As far as I know you can't reverse it once the payment is iniated. So I could still use it on the regular for everyday transactions, but the merchant would just need to wait that '10 mins' to actually spend their BTC, otherwise it would be in limbo, but headed in their direction which they could track.
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:53:53
Who says I want to?
*Edit: cool tip though :)
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:15:03

I actually lol'd out loud when I read that. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:47:05
It's basically like Craigslist, but for Bitcoin. 
You contact a seller and initiate a trade, you can meet them in person to square up or you can make a deposit into their bank account. 
Personally I do the bank account option, just a little bit safer/easier in my mind. I also make sure that I find a seller that will put the coins into escrow so that they are protected during the sale and can't be double sold or anything shady. 
I've used it to make 6 different transactions, each one was super smooth, and I never had an issue transferring the coins out afterwords. 
And with this site, along with all my other Bitcoin related material, I keep it protected by a third party authenticator app provided free from Google.

@_date: 2014-01-28 14:27:42
HSBC just got caught money laundering and they're a worldwide institution. 
Bitcoin makes it easier to money launder, but at the end of the day cash is king to a lot of people. 
And say what you want about the collective intelligence about this subreddit, I think you're making too rash of a generalization and an unfair one at that. What you fail to realize is that many of us young people don't have a background in anything financial but are eager to learn. So we're simply inexperienced, but the more we learn about Bitcoin the more we learn how crooked the financial system is now and how fundamentally broken it is. 
Something has to change.
People are starting to learn that there are new options to self managing your finance. 
But these of course are just my opinions, I'm still really new to all of this. I just see Bitcoin as the future of online commerce and a large spillover to many brick and mortar stores eventually happening. As the hype increases, so does the price. If I buy more now, I'll have stretched my future buying power. 
Anyway, I just seem to be in a rant mood today.
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:40:39
Where do you live? And what type of establishment is the ATM situated in? If you don't mind me asking, 
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:58:23
I'm not trying to downplay what you're saying. You obviously make very good points. 
When it comes to money laundering in banks I know that there are rules in place, but HSBC can't just be the only ones that are up to shady business, they're just one of the largest ones to get caught. People are fundamentally greedy.
I also know that there can't be a system of only banks and no BTC and vice versa. Banks will always be needed for people who can afford them - if that makes sense. But for those who can't afford the fees or have the minimum amount in their account to get the preferential treatment, now there's an option for them. 
And please, I'm not an idiot, I'm just don't have a financial background. Yes I agree that the people who hop and ask about mining and that kind of stuff are just asking for it, but I'm really trying to learn more here. 
I'm not trying to live in a world of extremes either, I just know that there needs to be a solution to ever increasing amount of problems out there. BTC just seems like its the front runner at the moment.

Ban it and people will find a way, everything is still pretty much in the infantile stage, but you can't keep something like this from happening. Bitcoin will change the way the financial system runs.
Just think about everything that's banned and illegal, it's all still readily available - just at a premium cost. Banning something and making it illegal creates a black market, nobody wins with that.

Bitcoin = super risky, but just risk what you're comfortable losing. That's where I'm sitting right now basically. 
This is just some huge ongoing social experiment. If it fails, then I lose a few grand. If it succeeds then I'm an early adopter. I'm fine with that. 
I guess that BTC isn't for everyone, but the more I learn about it, the more I want it to become an alternate form of payment.

You can't regulate it, it's like trying to regulate the internet. It's theoretically possible, but very difficult to implement. People will circumvent and find a way. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:40:43
I like your attitude :)
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:14:30
Well shoot, so can cold hard cash. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:08:46
I don't want to go in circles here, you clearly know more about banking than I do. I'm just saying that if you make something illegal - people most likely will still use it and deal with it, think of pot, the price goes up. If one country bans BTC - no problem, just use it in another country. 
Banks are great for banking, mortgages, loans and investments. But for 'joe nobody' who doesn't have that much money and wants to simply make point of sale purchases and wants to avoid the fees associated with banking BTC makes sense to them. 
Everything is still pretty new, I'm sure that the processing speed of transactions and that kind of stuff will increase over time. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:04:14
Fuck Facebook, just sayin' 
@_date: 2015-08-08 00:20:58
Since they started taking BTC - all my orders through them have been done only in BTC :)
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:23:45
Yes indeedy. They make it quite effortless :) 
@_date: 2015-08-08 00:22:23
They accept BTC online at tigerdirect.com or tigerdirect.ca 
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:21:39
That got a decent chuckle out of me. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:53:15
I'm trying to work towards the double digit club myself. 
Might as well take advantage while the price is still nice a low. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:20:17
I like your attitude :)
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:54:48
Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:31:31
Welcome to the club!
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:37:34
Is that even hypothetically possible? 
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:26:02
Live to give :) 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:32:37
Conflict of interest, lol. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:13:21
I don't understand why this is getting downvoted.
Who doesn't like free money?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:03:15
I keep accumulating little bits more during these crashes.
I started with 0.66 of a BTC and now I'm up to 1.23 BTC just from riding these waves.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:06:45
Some sellers operate that way. But whenever I purchase from the site I use the escrow method. I've done it 3 times and each time had my coin in under an hour. Not everybody offers it, but worth hunting down someone that does. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:01:40
I'm also a little confused on the matter, 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:29:16
What a bizarre comment, my e-penis is doing fine that you. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:16:48
YOU ROCK! 
I was looking at their site, but it says there's a $30 fee with wire transfer, seems a little high. But I'll go through with the verification anyhow.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:30:57
Haha yea, you can tell I'm not really focusing on class right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:37:36
Check out for that kind of stuff. But be very smart! Would be a shame to go broke and have to start again. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:16:00
It's the future. We'll all be telling our grandkids about the start of it. 
But in all seriousness an ad free site would drive you more traffic and people would be very inclined to donate small amounts of coin as a supplement. 
I imagine Reddit will have an option to buy Reddit Gold with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:01:20
Why is this getting down voted? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:00:08
Basically the coins are held on the site securely so that the seller doesn't try and sell them to someone else simultaneously. It also locks in the price at which the coins were purchased at to ensure that there's no funny business if there's a big change in the price of the bitcoin between the time it takes you to purchase and make it to the bank. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:22:29
My transfer to btc-e isn't showing up right now either, 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:33:18
I'm looking to buy BitCoins. I'd like to start small. Maybe around $100 or so just to test the waters. 
Should I be buying them from another user or site? What are some of the better ones. I know there are lots of read me's and all that. But I'd like some first hand experience from someone who's fairly new like me. 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:07:36
Comments are better than the post!
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:01:11
Nice, first hand experience. Thanks for posting. 
Exchange it is!
How many days total did it take to get a some coin?
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:16:04
Thanks friend!
Keep fighting the good fight regardless of what the 'votes' say. lol
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:11:08
You're better off holding onto them just in case the price soars.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:49:08
No, I'm in Canada with my own cash :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:21:55

@_date: 2013-11-29 05:52:01
Very nice!
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:24:02
You've given me hope!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:46:19
Pop the champagne? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:22:18
Thanks I'll give that a try.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:13:41
I first heard about it when it was at $60. I'm forever kicking myself for not investing. But I'm a super broke college student, so cash has been going there first. Ironic that BitCoins could have now been paying my tuition : / 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:38:25
Check the sidebar, 
But coinbase is good if you're in the US, 
Or localbitcoins.com is a good option if you don't want to wait to a few days to verify an account with one of the main online exchanges. And just look for sellers that have a cash deposit option with escrow for the coins - safe, simple and fast!
Mining is not worth it! Don't even bother.
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:04:14
I notice that the price on there is way higher too!
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:03:20
Thanks for the quick response :)
I'll sit tight, 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:34:46
Yea for sure, someone gifted that to me from a previous post :D
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:01:40
Use it to buy more Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:09:30
You can use localbitcoins.com and make a cash deposit at a bank for most sellers. No need to meet them or anything like that, also very fast. Just find a seller that offers cash deposits and escrow for the coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:27:56
You can buy fractions of it without any trouble
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:16:05
I know! That's why I'm trying to be proactive now. At the beginning of my semester I had decided to pay for my year in full for college - just so I wouldn't be temped to do anything dumb with my money. I was planning on just paying for my fall semester and investing the rest in Bitcoin. But this was right about the time when they were at $200 heading down towards $60, the crash scared me away, so I decided it wasn't worth it! What a silly choice!
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:23:59
Having been there, it's definitely an awesome place! I would live there no problem :D
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:19:12
I would have thought that they'd be everywhere by now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:21:57
They don't accept CIBC, I tried them, thanks for the tip though! I'm thinking of just opening an account at another bank and leaving that to just Bitcoin related transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:52:34
I'm looking to buy around that much as well, 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:16:05

@_date: 2013-11-30 05:30:55
a blockchain.info wallet can be printed

You're right, sell everything and give up?

Looks like it's back on the upswing now,
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:30:18
For the weekend maybe, then prices should head back up. Happens every weekend, why would this one be any different?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:21:03
What a perfect world that would be. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:17:00
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:25:45
Well obviously. 
What are some of the better sites? Does it matter that I'm in Canada? Should I be buying "physical" BitCoins or just digital? 
Sorry I'm a super n00b 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:55:10
Cash deposit at a bank... 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:23:19
Nice it worked! I'm rich now right? lol
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:30:49
You can create a free account at dropbox.com
Link that to your gmail and then to your blockchain.info wallet. Works like a charm
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:01:58
I was thinking the exact same thing when I bought it at $800, it's just based on personal opinion. Some see this is an outstanding bargain, others are skeptical that it will go any higher. 
Yet everyday it becomes more and more mainstream and it just keeps gaining in price. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:16:08
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:39:15
Check the links in the sidebar, tons of useful stuff there. The Wikipedia page is also an excellent resource. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:58:39

So much yes!
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:34:27

YOU FREAKING ROCK!

@_date: 2013-11-26 21:39:27
I remember reading a similar post yesterday involving coinbase and wells fargo. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:14:31
Yea I guess that's more likely.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:01:55
I like this answer :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:27:24
Oh, I didn't even realize that was a deposit option.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:18:13
I almost bought some 2 days ago when the price was in the $40's, but I came to my senses and just bought some more Bitcoin instead!
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:31:38
And using dropbox with your friends is also pretty sweet for transferring files. You can set who can see what folders and whatnot. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:52:27
Sure I do, wouldn't invest without research. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:13:11
Well written.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:47:22
Man, I would love to be the recipient of someones random act of kindness!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:07:48
Buy an ATM... Sell your own coins through it as if it were an exchange. Profit.
 
Just takes a decent initial investment is all. And you'll have to have solid network security on it. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:16:48
I wish I was in Vancouver or at least close!
I'm on the other side of the country,
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:55:51
Paper wallet is probably the best bet if he doesn't have a wallet of his own. With the paper wallets you can essentially deposit them anywhere. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:47:22
I want one! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:01:20
Is this working? I downloaded everything and am patiently waiting :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:46:30
If you're worried, simply setup a separate bank account just for these types of transactions. Then move the money somewhere safer afterwords :) 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:46:38
Buy from localbitcoins.com from a seller that has cash deposit option with escrow on the coins. Simple, fast and secure. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:18:08
Just keep it up, it will catch on eventually
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:26:58
I'm no legal expert, but how would they ever know what you're up to?
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:42:19
....sigh 
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:44:17
People super frown on these kind of posts in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:29:11
I spent a week trying to get free bitcoin on faucet sites. Made just over a dollar, you're better off buying small amounts though. Really isn't worth the hassle. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:18:02
Thanks! Glad to be part of the team!
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:50:44
Must feel good though! Congratulations :D
And thanks for the upcoming grand slam price! lol
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:13:31
I think you might be onto something. I should be doing that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:27:08
Says the guy who has to edit his post for spelling...
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:11:12
I think you might be on to something here... 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:13:13
Can I use coinbase in Canada?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:05:20
Here's a tip: buy bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:25:44
Do you know where it will be located?
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:38:34
Enough weekends that I'm making this comment, no different than a real market either. Lot's of weekend pullback, people want to spend their profits...
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:05:09
Are there any other free things like this on Reddit?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:29:34
Localbitcoins.com - find someone who does a cash deposit option and has escrow for the coins. Super simple and fast.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:45:59
We did it!
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:31:25
It looks like it's being manipulated to be honest. These are massive, massive sell offs happening!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:38:09
Who's crazy nice enough to be doing that?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:22:45
I wish I could give you all the upvotes in the world!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:15:09
If it crashes, just buy more Bitcoin...
This isn't a crash anyhow.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:24:41
I've been wondering the same thing, 
Also, how do you prevent counterfeiting? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:37:07
Huh? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:56:33
So why is your wallet address part of this post? Are you expecting free money or something? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:37:13
Localbitcoins is probably your best bet!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:20:53
Oh pick me!
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:05:37
The day that BTC hit $1000 USD on Mt Gox!
We'll be telling our grandchildren about this day!
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:50:16
Yea I wouldn't mind a little explanation on the subject of that too.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:43:57
For believing that the Bitcoin market will rebound?
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:18:05
I think I would cap myself at 2 full bitcoins tops. But I'd be willing to sell them even after just a couple of weeks if I really needed the money. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:22:14
Easiest way to sell a bitcoin is through a direct wallet transfer and someone physically handing you cash. Could be from a friend, co-worker or some stranger you met from the web. 
You can sell them through an exchange that you link to your bank account - just takes a few days to setup. Some have faster withdrawals than others which is why there's usually a disparity in price between the exchanges. 
You can sell them trough localbitcoins.com which is probably one of the easiest online methods. You can set it up so that you make the buyer physically deposit cash into your physical bank by going to a branch with cash and uploading a receipt. The process is usually done within the hour. 
But don't sell just yet! Hold onto these suckers until they're worth a ton more and than buy people flashy stuff when you're a baller! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:47:47
For sure it's a bear market, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with a $1K cap on the price. If anything, the price will slowly rise over time.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:19:13
It's like a country just signed up for Bitcoins or something!
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:47:12
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:29:30
Probably around $50 or so, I'm just looking to start small and test the waters. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:18:41
Since I posted this, the price has risen $15! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:23
DEAR GAWD! What just happened?
