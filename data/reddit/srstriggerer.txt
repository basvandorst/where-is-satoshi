Perhaps u/jstolfi should do something useful for once and  educate his minions about the real world. 
The claim that being able to break ECDSA would allow to spend coins from any btc address is probably equally hilarious.

They chose OKCoin, the shadiest one of the 3 main Chinese exchanges? Glorious.

Please don't kink shame me. I'm just really into poop play.

I'm pretty sure u/jstolfi is the only person left in r/Buttcoin
You can see that place became a ghost town and the few survivors are so desperate they have to fall to the "it's only up a few dollars since 2013" idiocy and shitting on altcoins for their "comedy gold". Almost everyone there realised that their subreddit has transitioned into the true comedy, except Stolfi and a couple lunatics, which might as well be his alt accounts.

If running a platform allowing people to conduct voluntary, mutually beneficial transactions is a crime, then I want to be a criminal.

I'd settle for a world without such idiocies as victimless crimes.

Just because idiots call you an idiot doesn't make it have negative moral connotations.
