I'm interested and I will give it a try. However not some laptop, but a real server aka VPS.

Yes, I already have a VPS and I will set up a node in the near future. However I don't think the hosters will let me play around with their virtual network.

True, I suppose I could rent 30 or 40 VPS spaced out across the globe, but it's not very handy administration wise. The whole idea of having your own virtual network in a central place is that you can simulate stuff like latency between Europe and South America for instance. Basically playing around with the virtual network to make it look like real internet conditions.
Edit: there are other issues running so many VPS, things like custom images, cloning and stuff. Things only allowed if you have full control.

For the record, I'm not disputing what you're saying. I agree, but it's a different test scenario from what I was thinking of. It's basically stuff the whole test setup on a few VPS and emulate internet conditions as best as possibly with iptables or whatever. I might even give it a try, but it's not the test I was dreaming about. The one with a whole bunch of cool hardware :)

Great, I'll start looking into it once the christmas stuff is over.

It's end of the year profit taking. Blockchain technology is solid. There are bumps on they road but we will prevail.

As I understand it, it's one piece of code running on one PC simulating a whole network.
If I had the hardware to do it, I would set up a virtual network with multiple virtual servers and PC's, running various nodes and enduser wallets.
I would then start messing with the virtual network. Insert random latency between nodes or completely break connection between nodes.
Could give some good data simulating routing on 30-40 virtual nodes.

Hi, I have a VPS sitting in Europe. Would it be beneficial to set up a node? If yes, I can do that.

lol, yeah, I remember those days. Nowadays we can do it virtually. I may be able to afford it one day, when BTC goes to $50K :)
