Bitcoin is a very impressive abstraction, so it's often difficult to compare things to it directly.  I do think the settlement vs. payment network reference is relevant, however.
0-conf transaction ~= gold-backed certificates (payment network)
6+ conf transaction ~= gold (settlement network)

That's the OP's point.  Oxygen is something that *could* have a market, but for practical reasons it does not.  We all just walk around breathing it in for free.
If the blocksize limit were removed, why should I ever pay more than one satoshi for a transaction?  Well, miners may not accept it because their operational costs exceed the value it provides.  But[!] the rational miner would see that 1 satoshi tx passing by as a missed opportunity and do what they can to reduce their costs to the point where the 1 satoshi tx *is* profitable for them to process.  Factoring out technological advancement, the only action left to those miners is centralization.

The opportunity for pools to move closer together is what flattens this curve towards zero.  What you've quoted from the OP are not mutually exclusive statements.


This isn't relevant.  There is no requirement that the electricity-hungry mining equipment be located geographically proximate to the connectivity-hungry full node.  We're already seeing this happen today.


No, that definition of a meter isn't arbitrary at all.  The *actual* length of a meter is arbitrary, yes, but that definition was actually a refinement of earlier definitions that more accurately and reliably describes the exact (arbitrarily chosen) length of a meter using our [knowledge of our] universe's physical laws.  What is fundamentally important is that the length of a meter be universally understood and agreed to.
From there, well, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make...

was rather generous in providing reasonable responses to these demands.  How about you:
1. Support your claim that there ***is*** economic urgency with fact.
2. Support your right to decide that the blocksize has ***no bearing*** on the censorship resistance of Bitcoin, it's pivotal value proposition.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:14:38
Yes, and feeling that something *might* work is not the same thing as "will work".
Peter R made the claim that a fee market could exist without a blocksize limit, so the burden of proof lies on him to support that claim.  Anyone is welcome to dispute that conclusion and any claims/assumptions made to support that conclusion.  There is no prerequisite that they have a completely formed argument to the contrary for their dispute to be considered.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:40:48
This article is nonsense.
At best it can be granted some leeway for whatever merit there is in clarifying the semantics of the word 'market'.  But realistically it's attempting to skew the arguments of small-block proponents to something that is more obviously disagreeable to the average joe.
No matter what the blocksize gets set to, there exists a condition where the volume of txs occurring in the network impacts the pricing of tx fees.  This condition is obviously different than the current state, where any tx meeting the min relay fee will be processed.  If you don't want to call that condition a 'fee market', fine.  Call it a 'blind fee auction'.
But don't attempt to simplify the arguments of those in support of encountering this condition sooner rather than later (and testing how the system responds!) to being "we want more fees".
@_date: 2015-12-08 02:58:35
I didn't read it that way.  I won't speak for him, but it sounded to me like a statement about all tokens stored by the blockchain having a certain cost and therefore needing to provide a certain minimum value.  Any and all Bitcoin2.0 projects are welcome as long as they're willing to pay for their space in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:16:25


My apologies if the word "nonsense" offends your sensibilities.


This is the same straw man from the OP's article that I took issue with.


This eloquent paraphrase of what I wrote does not betray your understanding.  Recognizing that, let's try a fresh start:
There are three mechanisms by which tx fees could be assessed:
1. Lowest Bidder -- the miner willing to mine the tx for the lowest price sets the floor on tx fees.  Works only if blockspace is effectively unlimited.
2. Flat Fee -- protocol sets the tx fee (e.g. by minrelay fee setting default).  Works only if blockspace is effectively unlimited.
3. Blind Auction -- blockspace is limited and awarded to txs paying the highest fees.
All three could arguably be described as fee markets.  The first is a market set by miners competing on their operating costs.  The second is a market set by full node operators selecting the minrelay fee to throttle their costs of relaying spam and/or as an indirect reflection of miner operating costs.  The third is a market set by users competing for limited blockspace.
Was everyone confused about this?  Maybe.
Is it important to clarify the difference between these three mechanisms?  Sure, probably.
Does it matter which of the three gets to 'own the rights' to the term "fee market"?  Definitely not.
Did the article help clarify the distinction between these mechanisms?  Nope.  But it certainly did create a straw man argument on behalf of small-block proponents, suggesting that their motivations are not to maintain the security and censorship resistance of the blockchain, but instead to arbitrarily raise tx fees.  That makes *no* sense.  One might even describe it as 'nonsense'.
@_date: 2015-12-05 00:58:43
This too puts too much trust in the altruism and foresight of individual actors in the mining space.  The Tragedy of the Commons problem describes why this doesn't work out.
Additionally, this is not a 'chicken and the egg' problem.  One thing will necessary happen before the other:
 * First, increasing the profitability of mining low-fee txs drives centralization
 * *Then* government censorship becomes possible.
The opportunity for people to decide that minimizing centralization forces to thwart censorship will always be exactly as obvious as it is now, until it is too late.  (I.e. it won't eve be obvious until it's too late.)  And once it's too late, there's no cheap, easy, "hey, don't worry about it..." way to go back.

That's a pretty standard form of argumentation/debate, actually.  If you're drawing conclusions based on false premises, then your conclusion is not logically true.  (It *might* be true, as a matter of coincidence, but not following from the premises and reasoning that were set out because those premises are false.)


I think the oxygen analogy is a reasonable way to show this, though certainly there may be other, better ways.  In any case, you're already in agreement on the point OP is making with the analogy:


@_date: 2015-12-19 02:37:02

You assume big block =/= centralization.
Can you send me a link with some data demonstrating that the two are mutually exclusive?
@_date: 2015-12-03 23:18:08


No, it wouldn't.  Not if the only reason mining centralized to that degree was because mining profitability became so marginal.  If that were the case, then it wouldn't be profitable (and therefore would only be possible at some [potentially significant] cost) to spool up additional mining pools.  (*And* attract miners to them.)


No again.  Hashers will tend towards the pools that maximize the revenue they generate with their mining equipment.  At a truly global scale, you can't expect miners in country X to defend the financial rights of citizens in country Y (assuming country Y is the one being attacked by manipulation of centralized mining pool).
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:49:10


That's not a good justification for making protocol design decisions.


Only insofar as that degree of centralization is perceptible to the general public.  Who's to say that hashes driven away due to higher fees aren't being driven to another pool that is actually under the same ownership/control?


This is the centralizing force.  These reasons will discourage the creation of large blocks for some, and encourage centralization for others.  Those that centralize will gain advantage because they'll both be collecting more tx fees (processing more tx's per block) and enjoy an edge in (fully-validated) mining time while other miners are choking down their large blocks.  Starting to mine empty blocks is the counterpoint to the latter, but this further masks the centralization effect.  Over time, the majority of transactions will be mined into blocks generated by the centralized miners.  The others (assumed to be upholding the decentralized nature of the blockchain) will actually be mining nothing.

Your altruism is clouding your judgement.
The most profound element of bitcoin is not the tech per se, but the strategic arrangement of incentives that enables it to work in a completely hostile environment where no participant need trust any other and each can (and should) act completely selfishly.  This property is what makes bitcoin robust, or 'anti-fragile'.  It keeps bitcoin in sync with the laws of nature and therefore allows it to overcome the forces that might try to bend it, change it, or stop it.
I'm not trying to say you're wrong.  I'm just pointing out that one's altruistic desire for the dominant coin's PoW to do something more productive is just another example of an external force that bitcoin will not bend to.

@_date: 2016-01-27 21:24:32


This is backwards.  Double-spends are possible regardless of the blocksize, and they're actually going to happen when people are sufficiently motivated to pay *less* (to the point of stealing/ripping someone off).


Double spends have always been possible.  (It is also entirely separate from the capacity/scaling questions, so I'm not really sure why it has come up.)  And if we agree that Bitcoin is not broken by full blocks, then I think the point has been made -- bitcoin has not, and is not being, 'put on pause'.

I didn't suggest it was a solution, just that it's the best defence against running a corrupt implementation.  (The assertion being that the oldest version of bitcoin (when it was valueless and received no media attention) was the least likely to have been coopted by a corrupt entity.)

The main problem with this suggestion (limiting tx chaining) is that it reduces bitcoin's fungibility.  A bitcoin received a week ago will be worth more than a bitcoin received 10 mins ago simply because it can be more readily spent.
Also, while chaining is something we've seen in the network today that might be spam, it is not safe to conclude that: 1) all instances of tx-chaining are spam, and 2) there is no other way to generate spam txs than through chaining.
The only true limiting factor on spam would still be the tx fee.

TCP/IP didn't become a prolific, stalwart technology because it dazzled a few non-tech-savvy early adopters with a slick UX.  It became widespread because:
* it's useful
* it works
* the network effect
Bitcoin is already indisputably useful (and novel) and has the network effect on its side.  Let's focus on making sure it works, and not worry about impressing a few kids who fail to recognize the utility in it because they think bank transfers are free.


If that were true, Bitcoin wouldn't exist at all.  I would expect you of all people to recognize that.
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:10:58
Is that happening right now?  Doesn't look like it to me...
Even if that were the case, is it fair to say that bitcoin has been put on pause when it would ***necessarily*** still be processing ~3.5tps?
**Edit:** What I think is important to emphasize is that while many people seem to claim/imply/assume that the whole bridge collapses as soon as blocks become full, the reality is that everything continues functioning as normal for those who are willing to pay slightly more.  There is no doomsday event that occurs at some critical mass.

@_date: 2016-03-05 03:29:17


This is easy to show because Bitcoin is a stable system.  It's ***impossible*** for bitcoin to be both too slow and too expensive [for you and your use-cases] *unless* it is both fast enough and cheap enough for many other people and their use-cases.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:35:55




I don't think that's a stupid question at all.  If you're claiming that we "better hurry to increase the blocksize else all hell will break loose!!", then certainly you have some insight into the possible timing of the collapse(?)
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:13:47


I think you might be confused.  There being multiple sellers of a good does not mean there are multiple markets.  Rational buyers will choose the cheapest option.  In the case of mechanism  this is the miner with the lowest operating costs that is willing to accept the smallest profit margin.  In the case of mechanism  this is the lowest bid for a tx fee that can find space within a block.  In each case there is still only a single market for tx processing.
Similarly, there being multiple sellers of a stock (with different selling prices and different reasons for selling) does not mean there are multiple stock markets.


No, I am perfectly happy to live with those consequences.  Is the difference between 'wanting higher fees' and 'being okay with higher fees' incomprehensible to you!?


Who cares who actually does the "spamming"!?  It's a consequence of lowering tx fees; therefore it's what large-block proponents want to happen!  I mean, you are prepared to live with the consequences of your choices, aren't you!?


Not quite.  I want something to happen one way, and I'm okay with (but don't specifically *want*) the consequences of having it happen that way.


If we're talking about the block-size debate, probably not.  But I agree that LN is a more complete scaling solution and should be able to put the discussion to rest.
If we're talking about the original reason I commented on this post (the straw man argument based on the assumption that wanting to develop a fee market (mechanism  and wanting higher tx fees are synonymous), then it's really up to you.  Is wanting small blocks and being okay with higher fees as a result different than wanting higher fees?  Is wanting large blocks and being okay with spam as a result different than wanting spam?

Yes, that doesn't contradict what was said in the comment your replying to.  The next logical step taken by the original comment is that because creating the fork is cheap, the real value is in the forums/networks through which users can be coerced into using one fork over another.

@_date: 2016-01-28 19:11:35
That's understandable; as best a rational person can evaluate, it looks like several entities are trying to conflate all of the bitcoin issues to fracture the community with confusion.
I'll try to help clarify:
Yes, double-spends *have* always been relatively easy to do.  A dev (Peter Todd) highlighted this recently with a demonstration.  He did this in response to critics of the RBF (replace-by-fee) feature who felt that it would undermine their ability to accept 0-confirmation transactions.
The RBF feature is, however, entirely independent of the blocksize.  It simply gives the creator of a transaction an explicit way to modify the fees paid for processing that transaction.  (Which would be useful when, for example, the transaction is taking longer than expected to confirm (perhaps it was mistakenly sent with no fee).)


Yes, that is correct; and that is the general form of a double-spend attack.  Create two transactions, one to appear valid to the payment recipient for at least some period of time, and a second to supplant it in the blockchain by appearing more favourable/profitable to a miner.
I should also note that the current form of RBF is being implemented as optional, so those that feel it isn't helpful to their usage of bitcoin are free to not generate or accept txs that use the RBF feature.

Who's they?


I am.  And I think everyone else should be too, unless they genuinely believe that bitcoin-unlimited is viable.  At some point the system runs at 100% load, and it must be evaluated and understood at that threshold.  The sooner the better.


I would love to hear a rational explanation of a scenario that ends catastrophically.  So far, everything ends with very speculative statements hoping to generate fear.  For the two you've mentioned:


Even if every transaction were re-sent 8 times with RBF, that's still only equal to the network traffic we could see with the first step of BIP101 (8MB blocks).  Not to mention the fact that the blocks would remain smaller, so block relay traffic would still be less.
Is that load level catastrophic?  I should hope anyone who thought BIP101 was a good idea doesn't think so!


Even if this starts happening, trust is regained for those remaining because network demand is reduced.  Again, ~3.5tps is the baseline.
Even if we imagine some sort of bank-run scenario where everyone near-simultaneously decides that they want to leave bitcoin, it's still there hashing away when the dust settles...
And let's not forget that the likelihood of a mass exodus is *extremely* low given that the upward pressure on tx fees / tx confirmation times is proportional to the growth of the network.  So unless you're sure that every bitcoin user and bitcoin use-case has exactly the same threshold for tx fees / confirmation times, everyone will hit their limit and possibly choose to leave at vastly different times.

The last part is true, but he makes a flagrant assumption when stating that a larger block chain would be supported to achieve this.

100% agree.


I understand that, and I have a hard time claiming that a 2MB block size by itself would be a terrible thing.  However, I'm averse to it for the potential slippery slope of hard forking it could represent, and the politicization of technical issues that it is being used for (read: Bitcoin-Core vs. Bitcoin-Classic).
On the time front, I think we actually have much more time than some people think.  And that's being proven by the continued smooth operation of the network despite the DDOS attacks and us already being past some of the earlier predicted 'block-full-critical-event' dates.

This assertion (and the possibility that is *not* true) is what I find most interesting to ponder.  The blocksize debate and ensuing politicization of protocol design issues has created a lot of clarity for me around this key issue of Bitcoin.
When people compare changing the blocksize limit to changing the 21M cap, it's easy for people to say: "bah, this isn't apples to apples, nobody would ever agree to changing the 21M cap!".  So we're really just talking about how easy it is for the average joe to rationalize a protocol change through to its [potentially] negative effects.  And therefore demonstrating a case where its easy to see that the technocracy and democracy are aligned.
The blocksize is an example where the technocracy and the democracy may not be aligned, and which one wins essentially answers the question of how resilient Bitcoin is to human greed and corruption.  (Though the question will certainly be tested many times again over different issues.)
For me, if Bitcoin cannot prove resistant to manipulation by human corruption, then the whole thing is a wash; it will just be a matter of time before it has been completely coopted by a central authority (or cartel) and be no more interesting than any other fiat currency.


I'd actually say the opposite -- the only defence is to never upgrade your software.  Running any newer version of software only increases the risk that it includes a disingenuous change added to serve a corrupted/greedy entity.

To the extent that may be true, I think these people deserve some leeway.  The community demands insight into the how and why of the core developer decisions, and the level transparency and quality of communication they have provided is commendable.
Keep in mind that many of the core devs, including Greg, began working on the bitcoin open source project in relative obscurity.  And their exposure to public scrutiny has grown commensurate with the project's success.  They have no option of retreating behind a wall of PR/Marketing department folk.  So while I think they're exceeding the expectations placed on them for acumen/capability within the programming and cryptography domains, I think they're also doing a pretty darn good job on the PR front.

Creating and destroying money in and of itself is not power.  It's something you can only do (*effectively*) when you have power.  And having power is really an issue of perception.  It can be influenced by things such as 'military-might' (often quoted as the de facto proxy for power), but really it's more nuanced than that.
Anyway, the main thing that self-proclaimed (or at least self-implied) econ geniuses like yourself seem to "know" is that their certainty in the continuity of the US gov's perceived power is infallible.  The certainty may be accurate on a particular time scale, perhaps even one that spans our full lifetimes, but it's certainly not knowledge.

The flaw is in his initial premise:


This suggests that miners form some sort of cartel and act in concert, leaving a tragedy of the commons problem.
Despite it being apparent to everyone (assuming that's possible) that the way to maximize total fees paid to the network is to limit the blocksize to X, any individual miner should include all transactions that he can in the current block, lest he leave that profit on the table for another miner who might discover the next block + 1.  (Recognizing that all miners must work under the assumption that they will discover the next block.)

I believe it is you that does not understand how Bitcoin works.


Those data centers necessarily are one of the peers.  They cannot be left out because if they are, the pertinent transaction would never be mined into a block, and therefore doesn't exist as far as anyone else is concerned.  So if they chose not to accept the blob of Tx data that you also just sent me, I'll never *actually* receive the bitcoin.

It is on the agenda and it is 'in the works' -- ~70% capacity increase via segwit.  But mainly:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
I speak only for myself, but I don't see any reason to change the blocksize until the tx fees are *actually* large (let's say ~$1).  This ensures that users otherwise making frivolous use of the blockchain are encouraged to be more efficient.  And it ensures we don't take any unnecessary risks prematurely.


Let's flip that around -- what event can you point to in the last 3 years that **proves** the blocksize should have ***already*** been increased?

I've seen this conflation between bitcoin core and for-profit corporations (and the assumption that they should behave similarly) before and it doesn't make any sense.  This whole "but I'm the customer and the customer is always right!" mentality (or at least, "I'm the customer and deserve to be treated with the utmost dignity and kindness from any and all agents of XYZ") doesn't fit in the world of open-source software.  These people don't owe you anything.


I in no way mean to speak on Adam's behalf, but it looks to me like he's pointing out that your assumption that Greg is "Core's spokesperson" is flawed.  Setting aside the fact that it doesn't make sense to compare an open source project to a company, if someone *could* be called the spokesperson for bitcoin core, perhaps Andreas is a better fit?

So you're speaking of vocal demands, not economic demand(?)  I can see that vocal demand certainly exists...
As for being thwarted: yes, I suppose the vocal demands have not been met beyond core's proposed scalability roadmap (which *does* include real capacity increases through segwit).
But I fail to see how the blockspace itself is thwarting demand when there is still plenty of room for real economic demand to present itself by paying slightly more in fees.

No, there won't be.  Miners are simply participants in the market (in different capacities depending on which of the three market mechanisms is in play).


You're claiming that the list is not comprehensive because the size of the list is bounded only by the number of miners, right?  Without insisting that you explain them all, can you explain 2 additional market mechanisms that could be used to set tx fees?


I agree that number two isn't a perfect market, but I included it because it is the predominant mechanism by which tx fees have been set/calculated to-date.


First, sure it is: see the top voted comment by Second, even **if** we accept that correlation to be true (because indeed, it is likely), it is ***not*** an accurate representation of small-block proponents' views to say that they want to raise fees.
It's equivalent to me taking large-block proponents arguments and saying: large blocks will result in low tx fees, low fees allow spam transactions to flood the blockchain; therefore large-block proponents want to spam the bitcoin network!


No, you need to admit that a corollary (tx fees increasing) of a result I want (the blockchain remaining secure and censorship-resistant by virtue of being more decentralized) is not what I want.  There's nothing to justify, because I don't want higher tx fees.  (Same as how I'm sure you don't *actually* want the blockchain to be flooded with spam.)


Without getting back into the endless cycle (these arguments have been clearly made many times elsewhere and I'm sure you're familiar with them), I'll point out that there is no burden on me to justify this case in this thread.  The OP's article declared that people wanting a fee market to develop actually just want higher tx fees.  This is a straw man argument that I have rebutted simply because it is a straw man.  Nothing more is necessary.

I'm a small-block proponent that is completely fine with a hard fork to 2MB based on the technical risks.  (Still a manageable amount of data, does *not* commit prematurely to arbitrary future size increases.)
What I don't like is the fracturing of the protocol-design/development community that this fork could create for a marginal benefit.  The bitcoin-core vs. 'bitcoin-___' battles are damaging to the broader public perception at this stage.
Preferably, the bitcoin-core group agrees to a 2MB hard fork as a compromise and we move forward in unison.
That said, my personal preference would still be to retain the 1MB limit for now and reevaluate when fees hit non-trivial levels (let's say ~$0.10) as opposed to when free block space is at non-trivial levels.

The point is that 'balance' is already in the bitcoin community's vernacular.  You can also look at pretty much any block explorer and see them using 'balance' to describe the sum of all UTXOs for an address.
My point (and largely because of the above) is that it's an uphill battle to convince everyone to stop using the term.  Beyond fighting the momentum, you're also trying to get people to contort their understanding of the word.  (Even when best practices are employed, it's not semantically wrong to use the term balance; it's just the case that the balance will only ever be zero or the value of a single TX output.)  It's not going to work.

Again, what the fuck does people discussing shit have to do with whether or not something is broken?  I don't give a fuck how much hot air people want to blow about BU, it doesn't mean bitcoin is broken, and it doesn't mean BU is anything more than snake oil.
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:31:06
Right.  UTXOs don't have balances, but an address that is potentially involved in multiple UTXOs does.


I'm not sure that's true.  It's easy to ignore the upside of using familiar, analogous terminology as a means to bootstrap people's understanding of a profoundly new technology.
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:58:45


There's likely some semantic hair-splitting to be done here around what an address actually 'is', but for most practical purposes they can be considered to have a balance:  sum of all confirmed spends to the address minus the sum of all confirmed spends from the address.

Sounds like what you want to search for is the concept of 'watch-only' addresses.
I'm not familiar with the episode you're referring to, but the importance of doing this pertains to privacy.  If you regularly lookup the balance of an address via a public block explorer, you're communicating indirectly to the operator of that block explorer (assuming they're interested in logging the pertinent details) that with a high-degree of likelihood, someone behind the IP address that is regularly making those requests is the owner of that bitcoin address.  This generally erodes the anonymity of bitcoin even if it doesn't give a 100% proof that person X owns bitcoin address Y.

The technical constraints on how bitcoin is spent has no bearing on the term.  *Technically* you can only spend UTXOs; that doesn't mean that UTXOs have a balance.  Nor does it mean that your wallet *can't* have a balance.


Agreed, but emphasis on the *should*.  Why bend language in an attempt to impose an artificial constraint on something that is not constrained within the protocol?
Further, 'balance' (in the accounting sense) arguably still applies even when addresses are never re-used.  The balance will simply be zero or the value of a single UTXO.

Okay, from this I'm going to infer that the measure of 'market share' that is meaningful to you as an individual is Bitcoin's market cap.  Perfectly reasonable.


How did you arrive at this conclusion?  (And I'm honestly asking you to introspect your rationale here.)
It seems to me that if we want Bitcoin to succeed by measure of its market cap, then we want demand for bitcoin to outstrip its supply.  This can correlate to more users, but it doesn't have to.

No, you can't have political stability without sound money.  Those who don't have sound money must use [pseudo-]sound money in order to restore political stability.
And I say [pseudo-]sound money simply because the US dollar is also fiat money; itself not technically different than any other currency that is/has experienced hyperinflation.  I.e. its soundness has been practically true for relevant time periods, but it is not *objectively* true.
Just as a goldfish will never understand what it is for water to be wet until he is cast from his tank, many people (perhaps yourself included) will never be able to comprehend the limitations of their local fiat currency until it actually fails them.

Interesting.  This seems to be conflating tolerance with decentralization.
The analogy is less suitable (as far as its ability to illuminate the differences between centralized and decentralized systems), but sticking with it:  consider what would happen if this housemate were incredibly violent and abusive, always attacking guests and beating the pets.  Is there something virtuous about (your definition of) decentralization that would cause you to still exhibit tolerance for this person?  Or would this now become a centralized system because one entity within it was intolerable?
The reason the analogy is less suitable is because the centralization/decentralization of the home really pertains to its governance, and all forms of governance are centralized to some degree (or at least have centralized points of failure).
For example it might be an autocracy -- one person (perhaps the home owner?) decides all the rules.  It's up to her if she wants to tolerate the sick or abusive roommate.  (Obviously centralized.)  Or it might be a democracy -- everyone in the house votes on all the rules.  The majority decides if the sick or abusive roommate will be tolerated.  (Much less centralized, but still there in subtle ways.  E.g. who/what forces the person who voted to be intolerant to now be tolerant?  Or who/what evicts the sick/abusive roommate if that's what the vote decided?)
But perhaps you were imagining the ideal scenario where there isn't any *need* for governance because all the occupants within the home share the same values and therefore implicitly agree on all the same rules (the impossible utopia).  That scenario is much closer to the human body analogy and I agree it could be described as decentralized.  However it's not decentralized because everyone in the home tolerates everything, it's decentralized because there is never any conflict that creates a need for governance.

Upthread you introduced the analogy to (seemingly) distinguish between bitcoin as a centralized system, and the human body as a decentralized system.
Nodes in the bitcoin network are free to do their own thing in exactly the same way cells are free to do their own thing; your own phrasing fits perfectly:  "No one [node/cell], or even group of [nodes/cells], can change the [rules/DNA] of other [nodes/cells]."
So I'm really struggling to see why you think that in the case of Bitcoin the rules form some sort of centralization while in the case of the human body the rules that delineate between productive and destructive cell behaviour are not similarly a form of centralization.

Right, we would die. But we would die because of our failure to perceive something as vital as water as being valuable. If water somehow had 'intrinsic' value that defied our perception, should we not have been saved?
Perhaps, to be less extreme, consider the value of gold. I'll posit that it has no intrinsic value. You might argue that it actually does, because even if we strip away all of its perceived value it is still useful for some things e.g. the production of jewelry. But these other things are simply proxies for a different perceived value.  (Why is jewelry valuable?)

Leave the house?  As in, leave the system?  By your definition that's exactly as centralized as the scenario where you evict the abusive roommate, the power/control has simply been reversed.


And what would they do to protect you from this violent, abusive roommate?  Talk them out of it (while themselves getting punched in the face)?  Can't you see how the logical end point of your definition of a decentralized system is simply chaos?


I'm not confused at all.


That doesn't change anything.  I get your point that even the violent, abusive roommate has some 'right' to be there (by virtue of partial ownership, or being a human being, or whatever).  But the only way for you to maintain logical consistency with your original analogy that this household is an example of a decentralized system (following your definition) is for you to persist in place and endure all manor of punishment from the abusive roommate.  You're either completely naive as to how bad that punishment could be and truly believe you'd hang on and endure it, or the house of roommates analogy isn't serving to prove your definition of a decentralized system because your definition is broken.
Coming back to the topic of Bitcoin you might consider how a node acting under its own arbitrary set of rules is a form of violence from the perspective of other nodes following Bitcoin's real rules.  The rules are what create the system.  Real bitcoin nodes can either evict participants who are violating their rules in order to maintain the integrity of the system, or they can be overrun by the arbitrary rules of other nodes and let the system devolve into chaos.

From a human perspective, I agree with you and luke-jr.  Some txs seem more 'spammy' than others based on what they're achieving.  However I think it's more accurate/helpful to use the network's perspective when defining spam because it ultimately doesn't care what any given transaction achieves.  And the fact that it doesn't care is intentional -- beyond the existing prioritization mechanism (fees) any codified attempt to filter/prioritize spam would reduce the fungibility of bitcoin.


Exactly.  Nor does it make everything that gets into a block not-spam (from the human perspective).  Ergo, the only definition of spam that [I think] makes sense in the context of bitcoin is "any transaction that does not pay a sufficient fee to be included in a block".

I'd urge you to [re]consider your implicit assumption that being a bitcoin developer is equivalent to holding a political position.
IMO, being a bitcoin developer is closer to being a scientist.  Yes, we ***do*** (and should!) want a very long tenure for all members of this scientific community that have proven themselves valuable towards the objectives of enhancing bitcoin's security, decentralization, efficiency and utility.  New arrivals are welcome, but are substantially more likely to make mistakes and substantially less likely to make valuable contributions (during their newb phase).
Similarly, you wouldn't insist that cancer researchers be refreshed every 4 years for fear of political manipulation.  The results they are striving for are objectively verifiable (e.g. 'does this thing cure cancer?') and not susceptible to political opinion.

When you say that morality may have natural origins do you also mean that there is no objective morality?  I.e. no basis for morality exists independently from humans or other specific creatures in the same way we perceive facts to exist independently from ourselves?


This notion that religion is simply a collection of wild stories seems quite prevalent these days...  I'm not religious and I don't see any reason to argue for the historical accuracy nor scientific plausibility of any particular religion's stories, but the lack of those things doesn't lead me to conclude the stories are useless (and should therefore be denigrated as 'fantastical claims').
I'll assume we agree that it's morally wrong to kill someone.  Do you think this is something that can be ascertained and communicated with the scientific method?
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:26:52


I'm not at all.  If there was something that I'm trying to do it would be closer to: put forth, in a palatable way, the *possibility* that your fundamental belief system is aligned to that of many prevalent religions which communicate their belief systems through stories.  That you reject their stories based on the 'fantastical' nature or scientific implausibility of them, but are then left to communicate your belief system in very basic terms as though it is obvious to everyone who is scientifically-minded.  However when pushed to fully develop the assumptions embedded in such a description you reach a point of communicating things in story form (e.g. a story that illustrates how one state of society is better than another in order to elucidate what it means for 'value-to-society' to increase), which when evolved over hundreds of generations might just loop us back to where we are today with existing religious texts...
So, with that context, to further push on what you've described above -- what do you mean by 'value'?  And why would it make sense for me to put 'value to the community' above 'value to myself' when, for example, making moral judgements on an action like murder?
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:54:05
Hmm.  So morality is really the output of a democratic/populist process?  Something like "what is right is what most people believe to be right".
Does that mean that something like the abolishment of slavery was merely a coincidental change in society's beliefs about what is right?  Could we just as easily have shifted to believing that 'race X is evil and should be eliminated'?
I put forth that hypothetical because without an objective reference point to orient us, I'm not sure how/why our beliefs would evolve other than from political influence.  What do you think?

I think the root disagreement here is that you want bitcoin to be ready for worldwide adoption today, where I'm comfortable with a slower growth path.  I say that because Bitcoinistan excludes all of the other transportation options that exist in a true comparison to reality.  So while doing so makes it seem like an auction for bitcoin-bus-tickets is disastrously wrong, there are actually other options that allow bitcoin-bus ridership to find its equilibrium through market forces.
I don't see how the 'fee market' could be viewed as **obviously** wrong *unless* one is starting from the premise that there is no other transportation option other than the bitcoin-bus, and the fee market necessarily means that some patrons are never able to get from A to B.


My general point is that the Bitcoin protocol by itself isn't a for-profit business, and and choices/decisions made in the design of said protocol are not best made through the lens of profit.  The use of "business sense" is no more appropriate here than it would be in designing changes to the linux kernel.  (Whose perspective to we even apply business sense from?  Linus?  Linux users?

I certainly did not coin the term 'hard fork'...  It's what everyone has always called it, including Satoshi.


So... You agree that there needs to be a hard block size limit to manage spam (your preference being for something much larger than the current 1Mb limit).  But then you say our best defence against spam is to write it into the blockchain as quickly as possible(!?)
If the block size limit is raised, say from 1Mb to 8Mb, the tx fee (in btc/kb) won't change at all.  So, for the same cost, a spam attack would be equally effective, but only viable for an eighth the time.  In the case of a fee market driven by full 1Mb blocks, the tx fee in btc/kb may go up substantially, such that for the same cost, the attack can only afford to put a handfull of txs into the blockchain (and thus wouldn't amount to much of an attack).
The mining solution to double-spend attacks is very elegant because it makes the attack prohibitively expensive.  A fee market *could* (I don't claim to know this with certainty because we haven't experienced fee market conditions yet) similarly make spam attacks prohibitively expensive.
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:20:05


It's disheartening to see the term 'war' used in this context.  I think there's lots of room for bitcoin to continue to be useful to those 100,000 people whatever the blocksize is over the next 1-2 years.
I'd rather not be considered your enemy because you think I want to stifle and eventually extinguish bitcoin.  Suggesting that bitcoin might be a foundational technology is really just suggesting that there may yet be other more elegant ways of scaling Bitcoin than just an 8x capacity increase by changing the blocksize limit.
Let's at least agree that our motivations are aligned as far as wishing to maximize the success of bitcoin.

Remittance payments, other international transfers, a store of value to hedge against [hyper-]inflationary currencies, a tool to circumvent capital controls.  Those are areas where bitcoin shines and *genuinely* offers value; even if Tx fees are $10.
You've already said so yourself:


Blocks are not yet full and tx fees are heavily subsidized by block rewards; raising the block size today isn't going to make bitcoin any faster or cheaper to use.
Bitcoin does not have any competitive advantages for small transactions when it comes to cost or speed.  The few people using it this way are doing so just for the novelty / to help spread adoption to merchants hoping to acquire BTC in this way.

This might be our impasse.  IMO, "no change" means leaving the hard consensus rules as they are.
I understand that a fee market hasn't really existed yet, but that's only been a coincidental side effect of the blockchain's nascency.  (And, to a lesser extent, the block reward which necessarily exists to facilitate issuance, **not** to make transaction fees negligible.)
The blockchain ran for 4 years with a 50BTC/block reward.  When the halving came I recall some trepidation, but I don't recall anyone insisting that this event be considered a change to the protocol.  Nor that to safely follow through with the behaviour (hard-coded into the system since day one) we should create a BIP and separately test both remaining at 50btc/block and halving to 25btc.
Thanks for the info on Blockstream.  I'll look into them a bit further.

Maybe.  The economic impact of such a scenario (extreme devaluation of bitcoin; mass flight to altcoin) would be so severe that people may be dissuaded even if there is observable centralization in the network.
Continuity is a strong force here, and most rational actors would continue to value the dominant currency (because everyone else will too) if only because there is no *exact* threshold where centralization has gone too far.  When a few people start complaining that their transactions aren't being processed by the network, will you decide that bitcoin has fallen to centralization and censorship and trade it all for an altcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:58:34
My suggestion is that the burden of proof lie on the suggested change, not the status quo within the protocol.  The same would apply to any of the other somewhat arbitrary parameters within bitcoin.  E.g. I don't get to say: "I think a 1-day difficulty adjustment period is better because &lt;speculation&gt;, prove to me why 2 weeks is best otherwise the change must happen!"
I agree that the 1Mb limit is 100% likely to be suboptimal, but that doesn't create an argument for any other limit.
Who is Blockstream and what do they have to do with this discussion?
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:23:51


Then I guess I'm still unclear as to why you're asserting that a 'fee market' is absolutely horrible.  Yes, at some threshold it will limit bitcoin's growth, but if you don't expect bitcoin's growth to be insanely rapid then where is the damage done?  Does the success of the entire protocol depend on the user experience of the marginal 10, 20, ... 50 thousand new users that might experience 4 hour confirmations or $0.50 tx fees in 2016?


We're speculating, but I 100% agree with this.  It doesn't even have to be malicious spam, just various on-chain transactions that aren't actually economically significant.  Right now there's little reason for me to not do my accounting on the block-chain with weekly shuffling of btc between addresses, etc...
But I'm very confused how we've arrived at opposite conclusions from the same speculative premise.  You think we should further support (and subsidize with block rewards) this spam by increasing the block size.  I think it's worth testing this theory we share to see how the volume of transactions reacts to increased tx fee pressure as block space becomes more scarce.  (And test to see how vocal the community actually becomes about $0.20 transaction costs instead of $0.01.)


In my analogy, the other transportation options are not altcoins, but other payment methods (debit, visa, paypal, cash, etc.).  The point is that, with a pragmatic view of bitcoin's current utility to a limited set of users, nobody will be left stranded in timbuktu, bitcoinistan.  I'd posit that 99.9% of today's bitcoin users have access to other payment mechanisms, so a poor bitcoin experience won't actually starve them of their morning coffees.  Sure, a few newcomers may experience some disappointment and decide they hate bitcoin and never want to use it again.  But again, is the opinion of these few newcomers the basis for defining the success/failure of the protocol?


I think you might have the mining feedback loop backwards.  If new investors suddenly stop flocking to bitcoin and the price drops to $5, the 'huge costs' scale accordingly as mining hardware is shutoff.  The market price of bitcoin leads the size of the mining industry, not the other way around.


You've agreed that Bitcoin is a protocol, not a for-profit business.  So who are these customers and why do they consider themselves customers?  Who is the proprietor?  Again, I don't think the 'business sense' angle really applies.


I saw an analogy somewhere else between bitcoin and deforestation regulations; I'll take a stab at it here with a comparison to hunting licenses:
Let's pretend we're creationists and claim that God put bears on this earth for humans to hunt.  His *intention* was for every man to be able to wield a gun and shoot a bear.  Unfortunately, the practical reality is that there is not enough bears on earth for everyone to be able to shoot one.  So in most places governments (who are imperfect, yes, but at least meant to act with the best interests of broader society) have imposed hunting license restrictions, with various fees, wait periods, lotteries, etc.  I doubt you'll disagree with the appropriateness of these licenses, and I will claim that bitcoin is more aptly compared to such a situation.  It is a finite resource that should be carefully managed to maximize its value to broader society.
Exactly how finite it is is difficult to say.  Certainly it is safe to project that it becomes less finite in the future with technological advancements, but I'm disinclined to assume that we can assume blocksize increases in perpetuity will work without any adverse affects on the whole system.
I recently read an article that explains well a perspective that maximization of bitcoin's decentralization can only be achieved by minimizing the cost of running a full node:
I think another point of common ground for us (and everyone in this debate) is that a centralized bitcoin is a severely crippled bitcoin.  The exact threshold (e.g. # of full nodes) for what is sufficiently centralized to yield this crippling is further debatable, but changes/advancements that encourage more full nodes are certainly much safer to make than ones that discourage the operation of full nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:10:14
Okay, ignoring the need for a limit as a safety measure, what would you say a reasonable blocksize limit would be today?  What do you think it will be in 20 years?
I expect both of those numbers to be &gt;1Mb, but are either ∞?  If not then I'd say that you have an understanding that there is *some* technological limit on the scalability of bitcoin.
So now we're down to figuring out whether that technological limit could ever possibly encroach on the user demand for bitcoin.  If it can, then at some point we will hit the need to enable a fee market, otherwise the limited resource of the bitcoin network will have been managed poorly and the failure will be complete.  The risk for me lies in how likely we'll be able to enable that fee market later, *if* it becomes necessary.
Put slightly differently -- imagine there are 400 billion bears on the planet and their year over year growth rate has been 30%.  Sure, that's lots of room for us to be granted free (or fixed-fee) licenses to shoot as many bears as we want.  However, is it not reasonable to still view this as a finite resource that should be managed?  Can 30% growth continue forever?  What if individual "spam-hunters" start killing millions of bears?  Is there point in time where we see that we're about to kill all the remaining bears, but we no longer have a means to course correct because nobody is willing to give up the fixed-fee per bear model?
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:54:57


The ability to bid for space in the next block with a higher Tx fee is another way to mange your own mean service time.


How would this minimum fee be resolved against the market price of bitcoin?  "sufficiently high" is always a moving target; how do you hard-code consensus rules that accurately control that with a sound feedback loop?

@_date: 2015-09-10 07:26:50


The possibility is that the fee market takes minimizes/eliminates spammers and other undesirable uses of the blockchain.  If we don't test that now and evaluate how well it works, how likely will we be to decide to do so when the blocksize is 8Mb and network traffic is 8x greater?
Imagine if every email cost $0.05 to send -- you'd probably still find it worthwhile to use email.  How costly would $0.05 per email be to spammers?  What would there cost of customer acquisition become?
Ultimately all I'm suggesting here is that we *might* have more room in the current blocksize than people think.  When the blocks become full, fees increase, spammy uses of the blockchain become unaffordable, and regular users remain unaffected (other than now paying $0.05 per tx instead of $0.01).


I'm not sure why further upgrades to wallet applications seem so untenable to you.  A bitcoin wallet is already a very sophisticated piece of software, is adding the ability to parse the average Tx fee in the previous block (and even inspect the current mempool for tx fees) and provide a reasonably accurate fee estimate that difficult?
Even the tx-retry approach to better ensure that a given transaction *does* get into a block -- what wallet are you using that isn't either itself a full node with high uptime, or a terminal to a hosted full node (e.g. blockchain.info) that itself could manage tx-retries on your behalf up to some maximum fee limit?


I don't think making bitcoin congested will make it better, I think hard fork changes like increasing the blocksize carry severe risk of making it worse.  I also haven't seen any convincing evidence that increasing the blocksize is the *only* scalability improvement that bitcoin needs in order to serve the entire world.  If it is (i.e. if that can be proven), then I'll be less reluctant to start increasing the blocksize now.  But if the reasonable expectation is that additional technology would need to be developed (e.g. the lightning network) for bitcoin to scale to the entire world, then I'd prefer to see those developments be motivated sooner rather than later.  (The lightning network looks very promising, by the way; have you read the white paper?  Do you think it could/should play a role in scaling bitcoin?)


This is really just a push back on the urgency surrounding arguments for increasing the blocksize.  Hypothetically:
* The blockchain works well now for ~100,000 people.  09.2015
* It continues to grow, 'working well' for up to ~150,000 people.  05.2016
* Tx fees rise, ~50,000 new users have bad experiences, but otherwise it continues to work well for ~150,000 people.  11.2016
Where has the disaster occurred that we must quickly(!) avoid with a hard fork?  Has bitcoin been destroyed by the those 50,000 users with bad experiences?  Has it lost it's network effect?  Could we not hard fork at that point in time if it still appeared to be the appropriate course of action?


If the blocksize limit is totally artificial, why have one at all?
I think there is an understanding that there is *some* reasonable threshold for the scarcity of blockspace.  Maybe 1Mb is more conservative than necessary, but the value is something finite.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:03:06


I think you are correct, but I think there is another piece of the equilibrium equation that is being overlooked.  There is also the bitcoin economy to consider, which itself will react to the fees.  Currently, fees are super-low, so the bitcoin economy happens to include coffee-purchase tx's.  If the blocksize limit is reached and fees start to increase, at some threshold people might decide that bitcoin is not an affordable payment mechanism to use when buying coffee.  That will mean either:
 * fewer people buy coffees, fees come down, and people start buying coffees again (reaching some equilibrium where some users do decide that btc is a cost-effective payment mechanism for coffee, and some don't)
 * the bitcoin economy no longer encompasses coffee purchases and is instead used in other ways that are content/able to pay the higher fees.
So when an authority sets the minimum fee (say 0.001Btc/tx from your earlier post), they're applying a minimum price on all transactions that arbitrarily swings with the BTC exchange price.  However when the authority sets a maximum blocksize, they're effectively limiting the # of users that can exist within whichever economy finds BTC most cost-effective compared to alternatives.  The former is more erratic and much more difficult to change if necessary (think miner revenue vs. consumer cost arguments), while the latter let's tx fees be an emergent property of the system and should be easier to change with consensus (e.g. 1 -&gt; 8Mb blocks = ~8x more users within the BTC economy).
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:30:35


I'm sure you're familiar with the historic price charts of bitcoin -- do you think it's really possible to coordinate hard forks within the entire network regularly in order to keep the "fixed" fees within +/-25%?


No, they don't.  In fact, neither do:
* Your suggestion was that fees should be fixed for the sake of meeting consumer expectations, and that the block size limit should be raised to make room for as many fixed-fee transactions as possible.  When and why would you suggest that fees should be raised?
* The goal of fixing the block size is to maintain the viability of bitcoin as a decentralized and truly p2p network.  Tx fees *might* rise as a result, but that is not the intent.  Importantly, tx fees would adjust in response to tx volume, *not* according to the desires of the BCCB.  This hypothetical BCCB is *not* capable of predicting future tx volume.


Uninteresting.  There are two ways an auctioneer could raise the prices of the goods he has to sell (a) set high fixed prices on each item and stand at his podium as long as it takes for all of the items to sell; or (b) let every interested buyer in the audience bid each item up to the highest price they're willing to pay.
I have never seen an auctioneer use method (a), even though it would provide comfortable/predictable pricing to clients, and yield high profits on his goods.
I don't understand the infatuation with comparing a software protocol with a conventional business.
@_date: 2015-09-12 03:24:54


No, please don't attempt to adjust the rhetoric.  If anything "hard fork" doesn't sound dangerous enough.  All bitcoin really is is a mechanism for achieving distributed consensus.  That relies **entirely** on a consistent set of rules that everyone can trust and play by.  If the 'plan' is that the rules continually come up for review according to some loosely democratic method, then the rules themselves are no longer meaningful and the distributed consensus system is broken.
And, yes, we might see a couple more hard forks, but due to the above we should strive to minimize the need for them and *only* proceed with them when we have strong consensus.


[My emphasis added.]  So we don't really know for sure...  We're in agreement here.


So for the simple *possibility* that a fee market might exist in the future, wouldn't it be best to try it out now while things are still reasonably small?


I'd say the likelihood is roughly equal based on the cost of the attack going up in both scenarios (fee market in 1Mb blocks, more tx room in 8Mb blocks).  The consequences of a spam attack are higher, though, when the block size limit is raised.  In the fee market case, every participant in the bitcoin network is prepared to defend *financially* against the attack by pricing it out of the blockchain as they're able.  In the 8Mb block case, wallet software has remained 'simple' and isn't prepared to provide accurate tx fee estimates, nor automate tx retries with increased fees, so everyone suffers the spam attack equally with confirmation delays.  Some mempool size management strategies I've seen stay consistent with this by ejecting txs at random, ensuring that legitimate txs experience the same delays the spam would.


Exactly.  So raising the blocksize limit only accelerates that problem.  Why do we want more people to shutdown their full nodes sooner?  Recognizing that it can't be reduced to zero, *minimizing* the cost of running a full node is the best we can do if we think having more full nodes is important for the health of the network.


Mining revenue isn't really relevant to the discussion, but I'll ask anyway:  How do you **know** this?  Total tx fees are entirely dependent on demand for bitcoin txs which would require a crystal ball to predict.  I will say that I think it's more likely that our current (or modestly larger) user base still finds utility in bitcoin when average fees are $0.76/tx, than it is that the volume of fixed-fee txs will increase by 100x in blocks with no size limit.
(I arrived at the $0.40/block figure as follows:  Current average block reward = ~25.25BTC.  To maintain miner revenue after the next halving, 12.75BTC must be generated in fees per block.  If these are full 1Mb blocks creating a fee market, and estimating ~4200 txs fit in each block (based on the 7tps figure and ~10min blocks) then the average tx fee must be ~0.003BTC.  Or ~$0.76 USD based on a $250USD exchange price.)

I'll concede that there is two different kinds of attacks, realizing that miners themselves would most likely be the ones launching the 'big block' attack.
And I'll accept your figures estimating a &gt;8x multiplier on the clearance rate in the event of a spam attack.
I'd still like to see a fee market tested as a means of 'costing-out' spam from the blockchain.  In a different portion of this thread we agreed that there may be a point in time where bitcoin tx demand exceeds the technological limit on block size.  For that possibility it seems reckless to insist that blocksize++ is the *only* viable approach to scalability.  And certainly, *if* we were to try testing the fee market in real-world conditions, you'd agree that it would be better done now rather than 15 years from now when the user base is significantly larger and we're forced into it due to a hard technological limit.  Right?
@_date: 2015-09-13 06:23:55


No worries.  I read 'new bidders' as meaning bidders in *addition* to the current volume of bidders per minute, which made it seem even more sensational.
As for a fee market BIP -- I'd be happy to see peer-reviewed content describing the merit and viability of a fee market.  If that came in the form of a BIP, I'd be fine with that.  But I think the fact that you feel it *needs* to be done as a BIP reveals one of the core elements of the disagreement (between you and I and perhaps others in general):  I feel that responsibility falls to the party suggesting a change that requires a soft or hard fork; you feel that responsibility falls to the party suggesting an action (or inaction) that might result in a change to the current status quo of bitcoin's usage patterns.
On that front, I can't think of anything more to say that might pull you in my direction; do you have any ideas?  Things like the context in which we originally learned about bitcoin and/or the primary value we each see in the system get pretty difficult to change with just logical reasoning...

"Sorry, the flight has been canceled due to a mechanical failure.  Please wait in this line for arrangements to be made for you to stay in a shitty motel for the night because the next flight to Timbuktu isn't until tomorrow afternoon."

I think you'd be very interested in the lightning network as a layer on top of the current bitcoin protocol.  It safely offers immediate bitcoin transactions -- no need to wait for anything to be mined into a block.
Wanting unconfirmed transactions to have reasonable validity is all fine and dandy.  And it's really cool that various merchants and payment processors have been willing to accept the risk of 0-conf transactions to-date.  But the Bitcoin protocol can ***never*** guarantee this.  User beware.

Why the incessant sensationalism?  Why would we see an increase in the user adoption rate of that magnitude when suddenly blocks have become full?


Two things:
* There are thousands of *identical* items in the bitcoin tx fee auction coming available every ~10 minutes.  And there is no harm in periodically placing more bids for the same item (double-spending your own inputs).
* The perfectness of the algorithm doesn't really matter anyway -- X users will get what they want for a price they're comfortable paying, and Y users will get left out.  *That's* the free market mechanism that makes this work; not some all-seeing all-knowing algorithm.

OP's assertion that minimizing operating costs maximizes bitcoin's defence against any size threat (by maximizing its decentralization) honestly represents the fact that we have no way of knowing exactly how big the threat might be.


Your extrapolation that any effort to minimize cost ends in zero cost and therefore a non-working system is a logical absurdity.  Of course you can't operate any system with zero cost.  You might as well argue that auto manufacturers shouldn't put effort towards fuel efficiency because once a vehicle's fuel cost is $0 it can't actually drive.

An individual might run a node because that is what grants him sovereignty in the use of bitcoin.
Businesses don't need to run their own node to query the network.  The cost of doing so is trivial to externalize (for free) or at least more efficient to outsource.
Now, that *isn't* to say that "therefore all individuals will run nodes, and no businesses will run nodes".  But it is saying that we should recognize the incentives for full node operation are weak, and we shouldn't trust that a distributed network of full nodes will continue to exist if we let the cost of node operation rise.
The possibility that the proportion of individual users running nodes decreases *less* than the number of individual users increases is purely a guess.  The possibility that businesses will bear the cost of full node operation is also a guess because many (/most?) can operate more efficiently (i.e. cheaply) without a full node.
In any case, let's see what happens with the segwit activation.  It will provide some interesting insight on whether increased capacity does necessarily correlate to increased users, and if it does, we can look again at where the full node count stands.

Interesting idea around charging fees according to the net effect on the UTXO pool.  If that were in place, would it make spending 'dust' cheap(er)?

Bitcoin is a system that *might* deliver a service if it's users bit an appropriate fee for use of that service, and other extraneous factors (network connectivity, individual nodes crashing, individual nodes choosing not to relay txs, miners choosing not to include the tx in a block, etc.) do not impede the service.
It has always been that way, and will continue to be that way no matter what the block size limit is.  By coincidence tx fees haven't been a major factor to-date, but you've still ***never*** had any guarantee that your tx will be mined into a block at all once you broadcast it into the network.
And if you found that one of your txs was ignored by the network tomorrow -- who do you think this "business" entity is that you could demand restitution from??
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:24:07


I agree with this.  Users must necessarily experience some delay in their tx confirmation before they're incentivized to try higher fees.  If the implication is that increased tx confirmation delay is necessarily a problem though, could you please elaborate?  Right now let's say the average confirmation time is 5 minutes (50% of the expected block time); if six months from now, the average confirmation time is 50 minutes because many of the blocks are full, is anything catastrophically broken?  (Recognizing that at that point in time, people could choose to pay for ~5 minute confirmation times with slightly-higher-than-required fees.)






That's basically my point.  Somewhat arbitrarily we arrived here with a 1Mb limit on blocks; why don't we fully test that constraint and see how the market/economy behaves?  **Nobody** knows for sure, so why don't we find out now while the bitcoin economy is still reasonably small?


This is really the nicest thing about leveraging the current 1Mb limit -- the artificial limit has already been set.  Whatever the exact reasons/intentions were, it was set by the protocol's original author along with all of the other somewhat-arbitrary parameters like the ~10-minute average block time, the ~2 week difficulty adjustment period, and the 21M coin cap.  Until we know with undeniable certainty that the limit must be changed/removed lest the bitcoin experiment fail completely, I think it behooves us to keep it in place.  The original bitcoin was launched with a "fee market" -- why not see how it works out?
[For clarity, the contrapositive of my opinion would be: if there was no (and had never been a) blocksize limit, I would *not* be arguing to add one for the sake of creating a "fee market".]
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:09:53
Well, I'll agree that fixing fees at ~$0.20/tx would go along way to managing spam and general bitcoin usage.  Though I'd prefer to see the fixed price as $/kb of tx data.
My main objection to this is that it entails a lot of risk that will be dictated purely by the market.  Either technical (hard forks every other day) or customer risk (quite variable tx fees despite the claim that they are fixed) in response to the market price of BTC.


Yes, I can.
* I think more intelligent wallets with reasonably reliable fee estimation capability will work quite well.
* I think the ability to set a retry schedule, and maximum tx fee will be reasonably effective at getting transactions through for the lowest fee possible.
* I think it's possible for merchants to use multi-sig transactions so that they take responsibility for ensuring transactions get into the blockchain.  (I.e. they pay the fees.)
* I think it's possible for mining pools to offer guaranteed tx processing services, where customers will submit txs directly to the mining pool with a fee (paid either in-band or out-of-band) and that tx is guaranteed to be included in the next block mined by that pool (the timing of which obviously can't be guaranteed).
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:02:00

This is hardly a 'strong incentive'.  The suggestion is directly at odds with a rational, selfish miner's best course of action (to max out the fees in the block that they are actually trying to mine).
How would this work in practice?  Let's say there is currently 5btc of fees in the mempool, do you mine a block with 2.5btc in fees and leave 2.5 as an incentive for the next guy?  What if your competitor decides to undercut you even more and mines only a 2btc block?  Maybe you should only mine a 1.5btc block just to be safe, but what if...?  Gridlocked.

Might open a rather large can of worms and be difficult to cover informatively in just 7 mins, though...
Good luck!

This is the point of the fee market -- it gives nodes a reasonable measure by which to throttle spam within the network.  Txs that don't appear to be paying enough to make it into a block in the next X hours might as well be dropped immediately.
What I don't understand is the argument that writing transactions to disk (in a distributed ledger whose data must then be retransmitted [potentially] many times) is somehow useful spam/ddos protection.


Uh, that was, is and always will be true.  Are you sure you even *want* that to change?
@_date: 2016-10-30 18:48:15


That is not true.  Yes, you can hold and send bitcoins without being a peer, however you cannot receive bitcoins without accepting lowered security and/or increased trust in a 3rd party.


The whole point of bitcoin is that your need to trust anyone is obviated by the PoW mechanism.  If you're not verifying the PoW, then you're back to trusting some 3rd party at some point to use bitcoin (if only to receive).


This is important for receiving bitcoin.  How can you know what address is going to be sending you bitcoin (and therefore which historic chain of transactions to be concerned about for the sake of verifying it) if you don't verify all of the transactions?


Again, this is false.  More important is the opposite statement -- that bitcoin is centralized when there are few nodes.  This is 100% correct.  In the extreme, bitcoin has only one node and in that state it is literally no different than paypal.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:22:35
I think you might be on your own with a fixed tx fee in USD.  Continually updating consensus rules (hard forking) to track the USD/BTC exchange price is not a stable solution.  Every time the BTC exchange price moves 10% will all bitcoin nodes be updated with a 10% adjustment to their minimum Tx fee?


How does spam create the fee market?  The blocksize limit creates the fee market, that every tx (including spam) will have to compete in.
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:18:06


I agree that neither constraint is particularly "natural", but the big differences I see are:
* The blocksize constraint is the preexisting approach.
* The blocksize constraint is more manageable to change in the future because you're not in a position where the miner's incentives (maximization of block rewards) is in direct opposition to the user's incentives (minimization of Tx fees).


When I read this I infer a degree of sensationalism that I can only assume is meant to make "traffic jams" sound really scary and terrible and hopefully rush me to conclude that we must not have a blocksize limit otherwise bitcoin will fail!  I think you know that in these scenarios, users will experience either fee increases or delays, but **not both**.


More sensationalism.  I agree that wallet apps may need to become more sophisticated to help estimate fees accurately based on the desired confirmation time.  Why would this be a bad thing in and of itself?


I think what you're getting at here is the situation where *all* blocks are 100% full, and some Tx's never make it into a block because the btc/kb ratio of their fee is never sufficient.  The perspective that I think is important to keep in such a scenario is that this only affects the *marginal* increase in transactions, and only those that are paying the smallest fees.  I.e. if we say that today, 100% of transactions make it into a blocks within some reasonable timeframe, then when blocks are always full, at some point only 99.9% of transactions are getting mined.  I don't think a poor user experience for those 0.1% is going to destroy bitcoin overnight; we'd still have lots of time to react.
So, connected to the sensationalism comments, what I really don't understand is the fervent urgency with which a blocksize increase is demanded.

Let's try this again -- ***can you explain why you think it's appropriate to compare Bitcoin, a software protocol, to businesses like restaurants?***  Who owns the "Bitcoin business"!?  Satoshi?  Your fabled BCCB?  What are these business owners even selling?  It's certainly not bitcoins, because last I checked those are bought from other users of the system who bought or mined them previously.
In your view, are we not all "clients" of IPv4?  Should the IPv4 "business" not use its good "business sense" to add another 8 or 16 bits to the addressing scheme so that we can stop with the miserable complexity that is all this NAT routing!?  No, because that doesn't make **any fucking sense**.
@_date: 2016-10-15 07:25:03


Maybe, but this creates a real financial risk for these miners.  In order to adhere to their preference setting they'd have to gamble by mining on the lower PoW chain.  The larger PoW chain *is* valid, and may still come to be the accepted one despite the signaling of themselves and a portion of other full nodes.
Same goes in the other direction -- the miner choosing to mint a large block that other nodes are signaling they don't support is taking on some risk.  But that risk is mitigated proportionally to the hash power of themselves and other nodes that are signaling support for larger blocks.  (They can more confidently work on a chain with larger blocks that will eventually trump the "acceptance depth" setting being signaled by other nodes.)
@_date: 2016-10-13 04:26:38


I'm following users (i.e. the economic majority).  If 51% attacks became problematic due to an excess of mining equipment, a fork to change the PoW is easily viable.  (And therefore also serves as a defense against 51% attacks from an economic minority.)

How is a regularly scheduled hard fork *safer* than not hard-forking?  Safer in what sense?


True.  And this a very salient point for hard-fork advocates to come to terms with.  There are many whose influence will be wielded in the direction of opposing hard-fork changes to the protocol.
The only time a hard-fork really makes sense is when the opposition's influence is negligibly small.  And there is absolutely no reason to assume that will occur at some regular time interval.  (Unless(!) your intention is to subvert the immutability of bitcoin by conditioning its users to accept periodic change via political influence.)


A valid opinion.  Did you notice that the ethereum hard-fork has resulted in two entirely independent coins?


And why is that bad?  Are you worried that the justifications for hard-forking bitcoin are too weak to attract users to a new coin under a new name with a new forum?

Thanks for the correction!  I agree, 10-minutes is correct.


Two things:
* bitcoin with non-full blocks is probably not suitable for those situations anyway as there is *still* no guarantee of your tx's confirmation time
* If you know that you absolutely must get that tx into the next (or maybe next next block), then that's probably a good time to bid a high tx fee.


I'm not sure why you're assuming that usability should be the focus of bitcoin at this point.  Sure, a lot of people are already using it, but they're generally more tech-savvy than average, and they're willing to accept a few caveats in their payment processing.  There's also already a lot of companies developing software at the edges of bitcoin-core that make it much more useable than it would otherwise be.

I don't think you're properly accounting for what market forces are, nor how markets react to them.  The *key* piece you are missing is that at some fee threshold, individuals opt out.  Individuals decide, "nope, I can't afford $4 for this transaction, I guess I won't send it."  And that relieves the pressure on the congested network.  That ensures that a backlog of transactions doesn't grow indefinitely.
The same would be true of highways, sewers and railroads if markets were created to enforce their capacity limits.  And in the case of roadways, this actually **has** [been done]( (though not as a completely free market).
If people had to pay a fee every time they flushed the toilet, and that fee was dictated in real-time by sewer system capacity limits, some people might choose to crap in a bucket to save $10.
If there was a $20 capacity fee to drive on Highway X from A to B, some people might opt to take the bus!
Railroads, when operating at capacity, would certainly increase their prices to reflect limited supply.  Customers who could no longer afford to ship freight via rail would be out of luck.
Airlines notoriously do this today with variable seat pricing.  Why haven't you launched some consumer advocacy campaign to fight the injustice of capitalism employed within that industry??


No, it's not at all.  The estimates it provides will be reasonable guidelines (the reasonability of which depend entirely on the quality of the estimation techniques implemented in the specific piece of wallet software), but you ultimately set the maximum fee you're willing to pay.  If the transaction doesn't get processed for that maximum fee (after being retried with the maximum if necessary), you'll just have to find another way to pay.

@_date: 2016-10-22 09:55:51
The only issue that would remain is variance in total block fees.  This comes down with a full mempool and a steady load on the blockchain.
But even if the variance remained extreme enough to allow for a situation as in the example (where a miner can either: mine on top of the 100-unit block starting with a 5-unit reward, OR ignore the 100-unit block and mine a 50-unit block such that a 55-unit reward is left for the subsequent block to entice the next miner) the article seems to underestimate the risk (and therefore cost) associated with mining on anything other than the tip of the strongest chain.

I definitely agree it's important to maintain a backlog to force a fee market.
I just want to highlight that this is in direct opposition to most arguments for big blocks.  (Those being that we should minimize the cost and potential wait time for all users of the blockchain.)
It's also important to note that a fixed blocksize is a much safer and more deterministic way to ensure a backlog is maintained.  (As opposed to leaving it up to individual miners to guess how much to mine and how much to leave in the mempool given that they have no idea how all the other miners will choose to behave.)

That's the thing -- even a conservative and predictable schedule for performing hard forks could be co-opted in political ways.

@_date: 2016-10-22 16:36:33


Right; which is why a fixed block size is important.  In the example I gave, the fixed block size would dictate that a miner could optimally fit 2btc of fees in the next block, maximum, and that the mempool would still contain ~1.5btc in prioritized fees for the next block.  The next miner is going to have a hard time choosing to attack the previous block as their total fee rewards converge.
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:37:58


A patronizing fictional story about a place where bitcoin is the only accepted currency, and then some obscure bus system with loose similarities to bitcoin mechanics is the only available form of transportation...(?)  I fail to see how that is an apples-to-apples comparison with / analogy to reality.  Most significantly, in the event that blocks become full and a fee market has people competing for transaction space in blocks, every other form of payment that people were using pre-bitcoin ***still*** exists.  Nobody is being left out in the cold.
I can understand if you disagree with the blocksize limit because you'd like bitcoin to be scalable to as many users as possible as quickly as possible, but please don't use that opinion as the basis for arguing that a fee market "obviously" won't work.


So you're really just talking about the miners?  I fully understand why they would want to recover their operational costs from the users they are supporting.  I'm not sure how/why that relates to the design of the bitcoin protocol, though.  (Other than the mechanism for establishing equitable compensation for miners must be accounted for in that protocol design (and make sense).  I think all options on the table allow for this, though.)
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:23:22
A perfectly valid opinion!  And good reason to stick to running whichever historic version of the code you're most happy with.
Finally, and most importantly, this is also an excellent reason to vehemently oppose any unnecessary hard forks.  Change via softfork does not take anything away from those who prefer an older more stable form of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:14:09
Sorry.  I think you didn't understand how to logic.  Let me give you an example.
For simplicity's sake I will use round numbers.
Now: 1MB allows for 0.1% of users running nodes 1M users 1K nodes
Increase 1MB to 2MB: 2MB only allows for 0.04% of users running nodes 2MB accommodates 2M users 800 nodes
Increase to 8MB: 0.005% - drastic drop 8M users 400 nodes
Thus we have more users and fewer nodes even if we were trying to pretend otherwise. The bigger the block the less decentralized and secure bitcoin is.

I think you have some misunderstandings about how bitcoin works.
Bitcoin is peer-to-peer cash.  You are only a peer if you're running full node.
Mining decentralization is important too, but the difference between there being 50 independent miners and 10,000 has no effect on my ability to run a node (and therefore be a *peer* within the network).
@_date: 2016-10-22 10:20:51
Assuming this were true and such an incentive exists -- what excites you about a backlog being maintained?  I thought the point of raising the blocksize was to minimize tx processing delays by providing space in blocks for everyone?
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:09:02


If you have few nodes, you necessarily have few miners.  So here's your options in decreasing order of centralization:
1. 1 node, 1 miner (paypal)
2. a few nodes, each of whom are miners (susceptible to coercion, manipulation as a cartel, etc.)
3. many nodes, few miners (susceptible to coercion/manipulation of the miners, however the other nodes cannot be fooled)
4. many nodes, many miners
Note that there is no such arrangement as 'few nodes, many miners'.
Edit: So in conclusion: you're fine with option 2, while I prefer option 3.  That's fine as a matter of preference, but you cannot argue that 2 is equal to or more decentralized than 3; because it's not...   And I think we're both in agreement that 4 is the ideal.
@_date: 2016-10-30 23:36:50
What he's quoted emphasizes that bitcoin was (and is) intended to be a *p2p* system.  So antecedent to squabbling about whether "electronic cash system" was meant to imply a settlement layer technology, or a payment processing technology, we should recognize that it in either form it must remain p2p.  I.e. every participant contributes equally.

Sure; and apologies for incorrectly guessing that you were comfortable with 2.  The second portion of the conclusion is still valid though, correct?  Option 2. cannot be argued to be more decentralized than (or equally decentralized to) option 3.


This is why (short of being able to convince every full node to also be a miner, (which would be nice!)) we should still encourage the operation of more independent full nodes.  Your only defense against what you've suggested (until we find some way of improving the decentralization of mining) is the option of hard-forking to a different PoW algorithm and essentially *firing* these miners that have been acting badly (e.g. due to manipulation/coercion).
Consider the following sequence of events:
* Miners are already dangerously few (and therefore represent a point of centralization)
* We decide that the number of independent nodes is irrelevant to overall security and increase the block size (and therefore costs of running a full node)
* At some threshold, only those who have a direct incentive to act as full node (the miners) can afford to continue doing so
* *Now* the coercion begins, and every other user of the system (having foregone the ability to run a full node and verify transaction activity themselves) doesn't even have the *possibility* of gaining visibility into the rule-breaking that may be going on.  E.g. rules such as the 21M coin supply limit.
This is a very possible scenario.  Your only defense is to run a full node.  The only defense for Bitcoin as a protocol and community is to maintain the accessibility of running a full node.  Which includes first and foremost constraining the cost of operation, but all the softer things too, like:
* documentation
* language translations
* installation instructions
* instructions on verifying the authenticity of bitcoin client software
* communication about the importance of running a full node
* communication about releases, changes, features, etc.
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:46:48


Not sure there's much to argue about here; this seems to be a key divide between small and big blockers.  Personally, I look at the value that bitcoin offers as being worth a $20+ tx fee in many cases.  Certainly there are many other forms of money transfer in our current financial system that cost more and do get used.
I will note that the block reward runs out in either case.  So by raising (or even removing) the block size, in order to sustain mining revenue we're hoping that:
* millions of users come on board 
* these millions of users regularly make txs
* miners maintain a reasonable lower-bound on acceptable tx fees
By keeping the block size limited so that there's competition for blockspace, we're hoping to sustain mining revenue by:
* trusting that there is sufficient value in a bitcoin tx over another form payment to drive fees up
* accepting that this value in a bitcoin tx only needs to be optimal to a subset of the world and use cases
I won't dispute Bitcoin's susceptibility to economic manipulation, and I think everyone is in alignment on the view that Bitcoin (and it's chances of success) improve as its value goes up.  The debate is really just around what is the best means by which to push Bitcoin's value up.  Personally, I don't make bitcoin transactions every day because it doesn't offer a compelling value proposition for day-to-day payments.  I hope that everyone advocating big blocks *does* at least make daily bitcoin transactions and can explain what value they get for doing so (over using credit/debit/cash).
@_date: 2015-11-17 22:12:12


I think you might have the relationship between bitcoin and the mining industry backwards.  Bitcoin does not exist because there is a mining industry which needs something to mine; the mining industry exists because Bitcoin provides something to mine.
This works on an analog scale too: Bitcoin does not grow/shrink to match the size of the mining industry; it is the mining industry that grows/shrinks to match the size of Bitcoin.
It may very well be that the total value of the block reward begins shrinking over time.  This wouldn't mean that Bitcoin dies, but yes, you could expect a proportionate contraction in the size of mining industry.
That all said, I *am* in agreement with you that growth (or at least maintenance) of the current mining reward levels (~$1M/day) is best for security.


Yes, there is most definitely is another choice: pay for less security and therefore get less security.  Currently the network pays $1M/day, which essentially sets the bar for what an adversary must spend to attack (via double spend) the network.  Is $1M/day enough?  Too much?  Who knows...  But it seems doubtful that there is a group waiting on the sidelines for the Bitcoin network's spend on security to drop below, say, $800k/day so that they can afford to attack the network with double spends and disrupt its operation **only** for the time period over which they're willing to maintain that rate of expenditure.


Correlation =/= Causation.


Sure, the blocksize is somewhat arbitrary, but here we are at 1Mb...  (And we agree that there does need to be *some* upper limit, right?)  Let's compare that to a hypothetical football stadium you own with seating capacity for 30,000 people.  The stands haven't yet been full, but ticket sales ($20 flat price) have been increasing.  Ignoring the construction costs, is it absolutely necessary to expand the stadium to increase your revenue?  Or is it possible to vary the ticket pricing so that people who are willing to pay more, do pay more?  What if when you hit capacity (30k people * $20 = $600k revenue), 90% of your customers are actually willing to spend $30 a ticket?  (Assuming the same proportional interest in tickets at $30) after another 11.1% growth in interest/attendance you could:
* keep the 30k capacity the same and charge $30 a ticket (= $900k revenue)
* expand the stadium to whatever and keep charing $20 a ticket (33.33k people * $20 = $666k revenue)


If other cryptos having available capacity is a potential solution, why are we even having this debate?  Why does it matter that bitcoin's block size scale immediately when the solution already exists (move to an alt coin)?

I think you might be arguing from the basis of your conclusion here (please correct me if I'm wrong).  My hypothesis:
* You've concluded that a fee market is unnecessary within bitcoin (and in fact a bad thing)
* Therefore you view wallet app changes that would support a fee market as superfluous
* Therefore you're arguing that it would be insane to add this complexity to wallet apps because it's unnecessary
Is that possibly true?  I can definitely agree that there is no sense in adding complexity to a product or system unnecessarily.  But if we (at least temporarily) accept that a fee market *might* be a good thing for bitcoin, then it doesn't make sense to claim that adding complexity to wallet apps to support a fee market is a problem purely on the basis of complexity.
Separately, I'm not sure that highways and sewers are aptly compared to bitcoin wallet software.  I'd be inclined to compare highways to the bitcoin protocol, and the cars that drive on them to specific wallet app implementations.  Highways serving as a stable base technology, is it unreasonable to improve the fuel efficiency and safety of cars with increasingly complex technology?

Yes, it does.  You said yourself above:


The advantages just aren't applicable to *any and all* payments.


I'm 100% in favour of letting bitcoin help the unbanked.  However, this is a corollary benefit of bitcoin and we should not sacrifice its integrity solely for those users.  Especially not when there is:
* much more to learn about the protocol in its current state as the blocksize limit is hit
* sound proposals for next-layer technologies (e.g. LN) that would scale bitcoin's transaction capacity by orders of magnitude (not just linearly with blocksize)
In another post, a user compared the blocksize debate to typical disagreements he sees between clients and engineers.  Let's use civil engineering as the example.  The small blockers are like the engineers -- they're not arbitrarily against expanding the bridge deck to 8 lanes from 1 just because they hate progress and don't want 8x as many people to be able to benefit from the bridge.  They're conservative about making such a change because if it's not done correctly, the bridge collapses, everybody dies, it's *their* fault, and even the old (perfectly functional) 1-lane bridge has been lost.

Yes, I realize that you probably wouldn't have to upgrade your computer for the difference between 1 and 2MB blocks.  However:
* Processing 8x the transactions would require 8x the CPU resources, meaning 8x less CPU leftover for whatever else you might want/need that machine to be doing.  It also means 8x the electricity consumption to perform the processing.  (Sure, the numbers are small, but that does not negate the linear relationship.)
* I think you comprehend the 8x disk space because yes, you would have to upgrade your hard drive 8x sooner.  Again, the cost of disk space may seem small, but it is still 8x what it would've been otherwise.
* 8x the bandwidth (both up and down!) to handle the increased transaction volume.  This may fit within your 150Mbps connection, but the increase is not free as you now have that much less bandwidth for other internet usage.  It's also important to note that the number everyone thinks of is simply their download bandwidth; in most cases, upload bandwidth is more restricted and will become the bottleneck much sooner.
* Finally, 8x the total up/down internet traffic usage.  This is separate from bandwidth and more likely the place where node operators would directly encounter increased costs if the block size were increased.  8MB blocks would require at least 35GB per month of download traffic ignoring protocol overheads and assuming transactions are only once.  A pragmatic figure would easily be double or triple that, and multiple times larger again (into the hundreds of GB) if your node is usefully participating in the network (i.e. capable of uploading a surplus to other peers).  Many nodes would encounter overage fees from their ISPs at that threshold.

An example will probably help.  Let's start at block 10:
* Miner A mines block 11 which pays him 0.1953125 BTC in block reward and 0.5 BTC in tx fees for a total of ~0.7 BTC.
* Miner B receives this block and can choose to either continuing mining block 11 (which is currently paying ~0.7BTC) or begin mining block 12 (which currently is only paying ~0.2BTC).
Arguably there is a risk-reward tradeoff decision to make based on the likelihood that Miner B's continued effort on block 11 yields only an orphaned block.  Yes, Miner B takes on risk of wasted effort by choosing not to extend the chain, but that could be the correct (most profitable) choice based on his percentage of the network hashrate.
If you're a gambler there's probably a reasonable "pot-odds" analogy here.  It would be a more complicated equation though, to be sure.
It's hard to know exactly how things would play out in this scenario.  Perhaps the largest miner just selfish-mines the longest chain as each smaller miner fails to selfish-mine ahead(?)

**Political** -- A dynamic blocksize leaves it susceptible to gerrymandering.  This introduces unnecessary trust.
**Economic** -- A non-static blocksize leaves the system susceptible to security decay.  Lack of competition for block space eliminates the need for anything but trivial tx fees; as intrinsic block rewards move toward zero, trivial tx fees would be all that remain; and trivial tx fees would pay for a trivial amount of double-spend protection through the the proof-of-work mechanism.
**Technical** -- If blocksize can be adjusted to an extent that eliminates any consequential backlog of txs, then the incentive to mine on top of someone else's block is eliminated as soon as tx fees become the dominant portion of the total block reward.  This grinds the blockchain to a halt, precluding its fundamental purpose: to prevent double-spends.

* therefore we should feel safe raising the limit
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:17:05


I think you're conflating the need for bitcoin to grow in value with the need for it to grow in tx volume.  The latter *may* be associated with increased awareness of bitcoin, which *may* translate into increased demand for holding it, but that's not necessarily true.  Equally viable would be an increased awareness in bitcoin as an investment vehicle / store of value which could also drive the price up without necessarily requiring huge capacity for on-chain transactions.


Of course, neither of us can see the future, but there's no reason to assume that 5x the tx volume (with no competition for space within blocks) would yield higher overall fees than the case of todays tx volume with strong competition for space within blocks.  In fact, it may very well be the exact opposite.  What you're assuming is that the value/utility of all bitcoin txs is exactly the same, therefore everyone would only be willing to pay the same fees.  This is patently false.  Many people may have uses for bitcoin that warrant spending $100 per tx.  Why should the network allow them to spend a pittance on transactions just because that's all somebody trying to buy a coffee is willing to spend?

If that's what you think (and I agree with you), why would you say something like this?:


You're implying that there is something terrible about soft forks, specifically those that would be needed to support LN.  (Yet you stated above that BIP65 looks like a nice feature...)  And worse, you're compounding that false implication with another false implication: that LN was invented by blockstream.  (Which it wasn't, nor was BIP65 drafted by an employee of blockstream.)
It just sounds like FUD; it makes very little sense.
You've also said:




Why the implication that we must limit bitcoin's programmability to its current state?  It just sounds like whining to the tune of "The devs I support didn't get to make the [hard-fork] change they wanted on the timeline they wanted, so 'F' everyone else and whatever [soft-fork] changes they might suggest no matter how reasonable or useful they may be."
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:36:10
Consider the value that exists in the network patiently demonstrating that even for a feature as soundly beneficial as segwit, sufficient time was left to take the least risky and least controversial upgrade path.  This strengthens another of bitcoin's (implicit?) central tenets: that it must be resistant to manipulation by individual and cartelized human interference.
(I.e. the community will be prepared to be very cautious of someone promoting: "Hurry! Adopt BIP-2390 with flag day activation of tomorrow!  Those guys against it are assholes and don't know shit!"  If it's *truly* a valuable/necessary upgrade, it can easily wait as long as segwit did.)
Also keep in mind that this has been *the* feature/event where the bitcoin community experienced first-hand misaligned incentives between miners and users.  We've learned the potential value of UASFs vs. MASFs and have started figuring out how/when to employ the former.  We should be careful not to rush due to impatience, and let the lesson fully play out.  Thanks to the studs (the real Yodas) who designed and implemented BIP9 version bits with an expiry date, the maximum duration of such a lesson has been capped at a year.  Not too bad in the grand scheme of things...

The building analogy is sound.  I like it.
"Current building code allows a 10 ft span between core support columns.  Two fairly well known civil engineers have suggested that the building code could safely be modified to allow 80 ft spans between core support columns.  They've even done some early testing to prove that it works."
That *may* be true, but the remaining majority of civil engineers around the world remain in favour of a 10 ft span limit because it is clearly the safer of the two options.  And their first priority above all else is to ensure the safety of the public who will come to use the building.  It would be irresponsible to casually yield to the request for 80ft spans.
The twist in the comparison to Bitcoin is that we're actually pouring new floors onto this building, ad infinitum.  So there is still uncertainty even with 10ft spans, and the risk with 80ft spans would be all the greater.
@_date: 2015-10-02 21:56:12
I'd encourage you to look deeper into how LN works; I think there might be some pieces missing in your understanding of it that could shift your perspective w.r.t. to fees for on-chain transactions.  (And please excuse the presumption if I'm incorrect.)
Most significantly, LN doesn't work independently of on-chain transactions.  The creation of a payment channel within LN still requires an on-chain transaction.  Similarly, the closure of a payment channel requires an on-chain transaction.  So, while individual transactions within a payment channel effectively happen off-chain, they each share a proportional dependence on (and therefore must pay a proportional fee towards) on-chain transactions.
So, if on-chain transactions start to become expensive (due to the permanence of a finite (though perhaps &gt;1mb) blocksize), people will be driven towards scaling solutions like LN which leverage fewer on-chain transactions into many real-world transactions.  And if on-chain transactions remain cheap, people can continue to prefer them over scalability alternatives like LN.  In either case, miner's revenue is still dependent on the scale of bitcoin usage as block rewards continue to decrease.
And note that each type of transaction still presents a value proposition independent of its cost (tx fee).  For on-chain transactions, users are actually moving bitcoin (i.e. similar to completing payment settlements in a hard currency like gold).  And for LN transactions, users are getting true instantaneous payments.
Due to the above (and assuming LN comes to fruition), I'd expect most users to split wealth between regular bitcoin addresses and LN payment channels similarly to what they do now with chequing and savings accounts respectively.  But I digress...

So, same goes for keeping tx fees low and raising the block size -- only the market will decide if Bitcoin will be used that way [for day-to-day payments] in the future.
Even now it's competing with 'tap-to-pay' convenience, and 1% (or more) cash back options.  So if Bitcoin's only value proposition is cheap and quick transactions, it's already losing and I don't see an easy path for it to gain an advantage.

Two main reasons:
* to ensure that as the total reward for a block becomes more heavily comprised of tx fees, there remains incentive for miners to extend the block chain by mining on top of someone else's recently discovered block.  (If said recently discovered block were not 'full' then there would be no fee-paying txs to incentivize mining of the next block.)
* to ensure that tx fees remain non-negligible through free-market competition for a limited resource (block space) so that the total block reward stays sufficiently high to fund bitcoin's security.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by this.  Let me attempt to unravel my perspective (or perhaps ideals) a bit further:
**IMO:** It would be ideal if the ruleset of Bitcoin could serve as a sort of 'philosopher-king'.  It has been this to-date, with much of that authority conferred from Satoshi and his original vision.  Since him, the protocol has continued evolving (and has further to go yet) via consensus amongst a collective of very intelligent individuals acting with selfless foresight.  At some point in time, however, the beast must be unleashed; Bitcoin's ruleset should become immutable such that it is impervious to any manipulation through social constructs/conventions (such as democracy).
Again, that's just one person's idealistic view.  But it keeps me attentively watching the bitcoin space to see if it can become the first human creation to transcend future manipulation by human tendencies.
Perhaps the authority of Bitcoin's ruleset (through its mutability) will be proven a paper tiger as well...

I think you might just be upset that I provided a sound answer to what you thought was a rhetorical question.
In the context of bitcoin, there is no means to inspect the content of a tx to confirm its legitimacy (other than to confirm it is validly formed).  So in **all cases** we must assess whether or not a tx is spam (an irrelevant or inappropriate message) by its tx fee alone.
Even if we have 100GB blocks, the min relay tx fee will be protecting the network from spam at a certain btc/kb threshold.

Consider an analogy to chequeing and savings accounts:
Your hard bitcoin (stored on-chain) is like a savings account.  The bitcoin you commit to a payment channel would be like a chequeing account.  There's flexibility to setup payment channels with anyone you want, but (because of the fact that bitcoin is locked into the payment channel for the life of the channel) it's more practical to have only a couple channels (chequeing accounts) with a couple hubs.
This friend that you might send one or two payments two (and thus have little incentive to setup a payment channel with directly) can be paid through your existing 'chequeing account' payment channel by the routing capability of the LN.  (E.g. you pay your hub, your hub pays his hub, his hub pays him.)

That is the key.  But a fee market can *only* develop if there is a finite limit on blockspace, *AND* most blocks are full.
To take the above example a bit further -- if there were a finite block size, block 11 filled it with 0.5 BTC in tx fees, and the mempool already contained another 0.5 BTC in pending tx fees, then Miner B has an easy choice of working on block 12 because it's already worth as much as block 11.
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:43:31
I think you're conflating taxation and monetary debasement.  The two are quite different, and there's nothing particularly 'left-wing' about the latter.
Taxation existed long before its enforcement was provided the convenience of reporting through centralized financial systems.  There's no reason to think that Bitcoin could preclude taxation, nor that a left-wing government wouldn't be able to deploy bitcoin-denominated tax income to support social programs (along with infrastructure, law enforcement, military, etc.).

Fair in the sense that every agent in the community has equal access to the code (for auditing and contributing), and what they have access to is the *precise* definition of the bitcoin protocol/ruleset that the *entire* community is running.^1.


Unfortunately we have some overloaded terms, but I'm pretty sure you mean blockchain fork in this context.  I think you're correct on this point, but there is a tradeoff.  With a monolithic codebase the number of users exposed to the symptoms of a hardfork caused by different versions of that codebase is higher.  However the likelihood of the hardfork is lower, and the course of corrective action is understood and easy to respond with quickly.  (The bug lies in the newer version that created the hardfork, and the solution is for everyone to revert to the previous version asap.)  When a hardfork is created between different implementations of bitcoin, we could see a lot of posturing, politicking and drama as corrective actions are considered.  Maybe.  :)
I should note that this 'strict' perspective only applies to consensus critical code.  libbitcoinconsensus sounds like a great way to narrow the scope of that code as small as possible, so that innovation can flourish in all other areas of the software.
1. I acknowledge that there is idealism in this statement.  There is nothing in bitcoin (nor should there be) that explicitly prohibits the operation of a full node running independently developed software.

This assumes a fixed exchange rate.  The exchange rate is not fixed, and as I mentioned before, is the more important factor in determining how well we're able to maintain the network's current spend level on security.
If the current exchange price of BTC drops in half, the same halving of the mining reward has just occurred.  Suddenly the spend on network security is only $500k/day.


No, I don't, but it's not really in any one person's control, is it?  Even if we agree to raise the block size limit, and the tx volume doubles, the exchange price could still fall dramatically.

Personally, I'm fine with being considered a pessimist when it comes to the blocksize issue.  However, I don't like the term with respect to the politicization of the issue -- pessimists are negative, and bad; optimists are positive, and good!  To the undiscerning average person, the latter is clearly the right side to be on, right?
In any case, yes, "remaining small" is a good defence within the security model of Bitcoin.  This is actually the same as maximizing decentralization.  Big-blockers tend to think that decentralization is only helpful up to a point, beyond that more decentralization is pointless.  Small-blockers know that more decentralization is necessarily better *if only because* it is completely unknowable where that threshold of minimum decentralization is.


I think this would actually be much more difficult (and much more expensive) than you think.  Bitcoin has already weathered two larger scale hype and crash cycles quite well.  In any case, I'm in agreement that Bitcoin stands to gain (both in adoption and security) by increasing in value.  I only contend that being a payment network is **definitely not** the only valuable use-case for Bitcoin, and that it *may* in fact be the lesser of several value drivers.


Your conclusion is based on the assumption that the bitcoin blocksize has been raised and on-chain tx fees remain cheap.  Yes, if there's no competition for space within blocks, then on-chain tx fees remain cheap and LN transactions might be 'stealing' tx fees from the chain.  However, in that scenario there is very limited justification for using LN in the first place...


Well, it's fine to *say* that you want more capacity and full security, but within the context of Bitcoin, you agree that a 1-lane bridge is stronger/safer than an 8-lane bridge, right?  I.e. you're content to trade off some amount of security for an 8x increase in capacity?  If that's true, what we're really debating is how much risk is incurred in that tradeoff and is it acceptable.  From there, I content to say that up to an 8x capacity increase may be reasonable short term, but 8000x (BIP101) is ludicrous.

No.  You can route the payment through existing channels.  Similar to an email money transfer today -- you already have funds committed to bank X, your friend has funds committed to bank Y (i.e. two payment channels with two different hubs).  When you email your friend money, you're actually asking bank X to authorize the transfer of money to bank Y (i.e. send the money between over the inter-bank payment channel).


Why couldn't it?  Look at all of the transactions happening today with even higher fees!  Wouldn't there still be value gained by moving those into bitcoin?
Also, keep in mind, it's impossible to have $5 transaction fees, and simultaneously no transactions happening within the bitcoin network.  The only reason fees increase is if space on the chain becomes limited; if it's not limited, then fees fall as a result.

I think that might be a degree of pessimism that isn't shared on both sides of the blocksize debate.  I agree that higher tx fees can begin to curtail the utility of the blockchain for various use cases.  But I don't see how this can happen at an exact threshold for all users and all use-cases all at once, causing a completely catastrophic and irreversible collapse of the blockchain's utility and therefore bitcoin's value.
Each individual user will have different fee tolerance levels, and each use-case will have different fee tolerance levels.  As fees start to increase (because blocks are full) and the marginal increase of users not able to afford those fees are 'left out in the cold', we could at that time choose to increase the block size and accommodate them.

I'll start by admitting that I do not share your view.  The foundation of Bitcoin is a universally agreed upon set of rules.  The original whitepaper served as an executive summary of those rules, while a single, open-source codebase serves as the most precise and fair way to accurately describe those rules.
Fragmentation of consensus-forming code most obviously carries the risk that unintentional differences/bugs will break consensus and cause serious disruptions within the network (i.e. a blockchain fork).  See the spring 2013 event beginning with block 225430.
Less obvious but more concerning would be the opportunity to break the current community-consensus requirement on the adjustment of Bitcoin's rules, and generally make hard-forks of the protocol much easier.  Multiple implementations means multiple smaller development communities that can each be persuaded to make changes in isolation.  Once &gt;50% of the implementations (based on # of nodes running those implementations) have been changed, then bitcoin has effectively been changed.  At that point bitcoin has become some sort of techno-democracy and the "trust in math/crypto!" slogans can be tossed out the window.
In the extreme it could become equivalent to democratized central banking (which even our democratized political systems agree is inappropriate), where referendums are held to decide prime lending rates and money supply adjustments.  Imagine what happens when Keynesian economists become the majority of bitcoin users and they decide to 'vote' on a change to the fixed 21M coin supply limit?
Okay okay, my wild speculations and future predictions aside, can you elaborate more on what dangers you think exist for a monolithic codebase?  What problems do you see befalling bitcoin if every full-node is running the same code?
I should more carefully separate two components of my view:
1. Pragmatically speaking, it is difficult to ensure perfect equivalence between multiple independent implementations of a specification.  A single codebase is the safest way to fully and precisely define all details of the consensus building rules.  (It would be further ideal if the code was always built in the same environment with the same tools, and run in identical virtual machines.)
2. More theoretical is a concern about what happens to the governance structure when there are multiple independent implementations of the specification.  Any hard-fork changes actually affect the specification itself, and should be discussed amongst the entire community, but we'll have created a means for independent bitcoin implementations to subversively inject the changes they want into their code and let a 'free market' (i.e. democracy of users) decide what gets run.

What have they risked?
In commercial banking terms I suppose there is some risk -- because they'll have made a bad loan instead of another productive one.
But in central banking terms (when the loan is newly created money), the only thing that is at risk is the public perception of the system.


Maybe.  At the very least, I think we'd be better off if we borrowed less money.  More widespread use of Bitcoin would certainly provide incentive in that direction.

You're welcome to enjoy whatever you'd like.  I'm powerless to stop you (unless you consider the commentary I provide on reddit to somehow be an impediment).
But for whatever it's worth, my full node has uploaded 894GB of data over the last month supporting the bitcoin network.  That would be over 7TB of *outbound* traffic usage if it were to keep up the same level of support with 8MB blocks.

Bitcoin is the honey badger of money in more than one way...
With respect to its market price and your expectations thereof...?  It don't give a fu**.

Keep saying things that way and with that tone and you are very unlikely to see your posts censored, nor your account banned.

All points are spot-on; great read!

Downvoted because you've misrepresented Pieter's opinion on BIP-148.

Sorry the reference link didn't match your expectations.

That isn't true at all.  Many of us are independent thinkers and arrived at the same conclusion ourselves (that we should steer clear of contentious hard forks).
To say that one guy created the divide simplify the grows the divide in the 'us vs. them'-type thinking.  It's not helpful.

Arguing that hierarchy is natural is not inconsistent with the suggestion that social structures should endeavor to mitigate the negative consequences for the losers in the hierarchy.
That's like saying that I can't argue gravity is natural without also arguing that we shouldn't construct buildings capable of standing up against it.

The point is that the $100/month the bank pays don't need to exist because they just get applied as a credit against the $1,100 loan repayment.
I.e. instead of paying $1,100 each month to service the debt, the borrower pays $1,000 and does $100 worth of work each month.

No offence, but it seems like you've lost touch with your inner honey badger.  Panicking about Jihan Wu with a controversial play like BIP148 is giving WAY more fucks than a honey badger ever would.
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:57:43
Basically all you need to know is that bitcoin is a [honey badger](  Tough as nails and not giving a fuck about anything.
**Segwit** (also referred to by its Bitcoin Improvement Propsal (BIP) number 141, i.e. 'BIP141') is an upgrade for the honey badger that makes him twice as tough, but he has to eat a bunch of vegetables to 'activate' the upgrade.
Now, the honey badger has been taking his sweet-ass time eating vegetables and hasn't eaten very many.  So it doesn't look like his super-strength upgrade is going to activate as soon as one small group of his fans (some foxes) would like.  So they've created another BIP, **BIP148**, which essentially tries to lure the honey badger towards the vegetables with a 'scary' time limit.  The trouble is, the honey badger doesn't give a fuck about some small group of foxes nor what they want.  Knowing this, all the foxes can do is make a bunch of noise on reddit in hopes of convincing other animals to support them.
Another group of varmint (snakes) don't want the honey badger to simply receive the super-strength upgrade and carry on.  They want to kill the honey badger, reincarnate a new one that's twice as fat, and then feed him the vegetables for the super-strength upgrade.  This path has most commonly been referred to as **segwit2x**.  It is a bit strange (and concerning) that this group is insistent on killing the honey badger first, then creating a new one.  But hard to know what their exact motives are; they're snakes after all...   Again, the honey badger doesn't really give a fuck about this group of snakes, so they're left to make a bunch of noise on reddit and try to convince other animals to believe in their plan.
*NOW* (and this what my post is about) we're seeing rhetoric that implies the only options for the honey badger are:
 * Eat a bunch of vegetables double-quick to satisfy the foxes, OR
 * Be killed, reincarnated as a fat honey badger, then eat vegetables
More than likely, the honey badger that is bitcoin is going to keep on doing whatever he feels like doing -- notably eating vegetables when he's good and ready, and not getting killed by snakes.  These noisy foxes and snakes will fade into history.  After all, most of the animals in the world aren't even within earshot of the noise no reddit...
So, for someone new to Bitcoin such as yourself, my message is essentially the same:  don't let hype and FUD using this terminology worry nor excite you too much.  Everything is as it should be; the honey badger marches on.  Spend your time learning about the bitcoin technology and ignore these PR games.

Yes, a second layer is a necessity if you want to scale.  This is not a matter of 'characterization'.

Please don't infer any investment advice from this.  I have no idea what will happen to bitcoin's price within the august 1st time frame.
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:04:26
It really doesn't...  And until it truly offers an improvement for those sorts of payments (e.g. buying a coffee), it really shouldn't be.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:02:09


No thanks.
(And that pretty much sums it up.  I'll definitely take some BTC though!)
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:17:16
Soft-forks don't change the rules, they add rules.
Hard-forks change the rules.  There's nothing honest about them.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:23:22
No thanks.  I'm happy with the power I have in the node I'm currently running.  :)
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:05:39
You can see who the 'contributors' are to each, but even that is largely misleading.  Lots of effort can go into designing/proposing an improvement to Bitcoin that doesn't manifest in commits to the markdown file describing the improvement.


Nothing, really...  'Who' created/suggested an idea is only somewhat interesting when the merit of the idea is not self-evident.


A full node is your own instance of bitcoin client software running on hardware that you are in full control.  It is necessary to provide you access to the true 'trustless' nature of bitcoin.  Anything else involves some amount of trust in someone else's server equipment, someone else's software's interpretation of the blockchain state, etc.
For example, if you have a wallet on blockchain.info and I send you 10mBTC, all you really know is whether blockchain.info is *telling* you that you've received 10mBTC.  Not whether that 10mBTC transaction *actually* occurred within the bitcoin network.

Keep practicing!  Teaching others is the best way to verify and solidify your own understanding of a subject.
What I find challenging about explaining bitcoin is that most people don't [yet] recognize why they should care.  Before diving into blocks, confirmation time, tx fees, coin-issuance, and SHA-256 I think it's best to search for a catalyst that can help motivate someone to learn more about Bitcoin.  (And that may not always be possible.  For most, the interest is in the 'wow, that's a hot stock!' perspective, and that kind of misses the point...)
Once they're motivated, you can explain by answering their questions as they arrive at them.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:50:23
Irrespective of BIP148, it has always been (and continues to be) a best practice to fully own and control your bitcoin with your own wallet.  No need to panic, but no time like the present for undertaking the self-education required to competently manage your own bitcoins.
As for BIP148, I don't think it'll happen.  The honey badger that is bitcoin doesn't give a f*** about all the hype, it'll just keep doing its thing...
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:20:07
*Technically* this can close the loop, yes.  But as that explanation alleviates some concern/confusion, it also highlights the 'enslavement' angle presented in the video -- the only way to repay your overall debt is to do ***free work*** for the entity that created the money for the loan in the first place.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:28:04
I say 'impatience' in light of more patient alternatives to segwit activation such as BIP149.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:29:27
Why do you think you would be excluded from using the new forms of tx?
