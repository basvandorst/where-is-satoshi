If you are putting $15,000 into bitcoin, first step, is buy a Trezor.

Did you know the average haul from a bank robbery in the US is $4,000. 7 bitcoins.  
Its alarming someone stole 120,000 bitcoins, and Bitfinex still don't know HOW exactly they did it..  I'd be a bit wary too.

At least you got back 60% broski! 
@_date: 2016-08-21 07:22:49
I got my feet wet with GOX. So my coins are on a Trezor. 
But personally, I've seen the stagnation with bitcoin development vs other alts, and divested about 50% into other more innovative projects. 
It really has been a soap opera this year.  Watch less TV, buy more crypto.

While their trading engine is THE WORST. I have found their support staff to be excellent. 
That being said. If their trading engine we're better built. I wouldn't have to use support so much. 
Try posting in r/kraken there is a regular support visibility thread, where you may be able to outline your problem.. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:41:32
Yeah thats recoverable. Just contact support. A segwit address and you are boned though. Perhaps one reason the exchanges are holding off. 
Though a miner did scoop all the segwit / bch late last year. And was offering recovery for a 30% Fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:31:15
Stop this. It's embarrassing. These fees are fkd. They are killing market adoption. 
Stop trying to justify the maddness. At least we have Bitcoin cash. What about all the poor newbies buying $200 worth, and then trying to move it!  
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:39:18
A Bitcoin legacy address is recoverable. You will need to contact the exchange. 
Bitcoin segwit address however, and you are shit out of luck. Alothough a miner a while back did scoop them, and was offering recovery for a 30% fee. 
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:23:10
I just parroted a number I read the other day. Burn on me. Which is embarrassing, because that's not hard to math out. 
Here is another one where I may be misinformed. 7 transactions per second on the 1mb base layer. Is that correct?
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:56:52
People are gullible, and love a good get rich quick scheme.
The price starts going up, and people buy, and you aren't about to sell, because it went up 10% TODAY.  There is this "store of value, $100k narative". 
Once you get to 10k plus. People with stacks of Bitcoin are cashing out their millions, because they don't want to miss out THIS time. 
And at those prices, miners are producing, and selling, some 250 million dollars a day of new Bitcoin. 
How are we going to get the price higher? Is wall street piling in to make millennials rich? Doubtful. 
Are you really going to 10x your money with Bitcoin? That would mean miners are creating 2.5 billion in bitcoin a day. Bearing in mind it's not actually useful. Too slow and expensive to buy anything. 
Where is ALL that new money to raise the price going to come from? 250 million per day just to tread water, with nobody but the miners selling. 
I don't see it.

Good job team 
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:04:44
The network is crippled at a mere 7 transactions per second. Adoption and usecases are stifled by fees. 
This will be a huge dissilusion for some, and will set back crypto adoption years. But something else will replace it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:29:42
You guys have it so arse backwards.  
Its ability as a permissionless digital medium of exchange is what gave it value.  It was worthless, until people started buying Pizzas with it. 
The fees have destroyed merchant adoption and usefullness.
Now you are trying to prop up $20,000 of value with a circle jerk.  I guess we will see how strong meme power really is.  Got trump in.  But I don't think it will hold up when it comes to MONEY.

You can choose to have your Bitcoin remitted as cash. Which would make the most sense in terms of "I want the money". 
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:20:49
You mean bitcoin - as in blockchain in general? 
I mean this bug discovery was absolutely best case scenario. Discovered by white hat, patch made to miners before it went public.  
Who cares about the rest of the nodes. 
But kind of freaky that it would have cost $120K to break the whole immutible money ledger system.  I think its pretty noteworthy?

It bothers me that we as a group of crypto enthusiasts, have descended into such venomous name calling.  
For the record I don't think either side of the blocksize debate is mustache twirling evil. I think they both passionately believe in their own cause. 
But here we are, no blood has been shed, just words.  Yet the hatred online in both camps is staggering, as we fight and fume over bitcoins future, which is ultimately just a name.  Its software that is open source. 
Its seems human greed has poisoned another well? Hope we can rise above.  But I'm not too worried, blockchain tech has been invented, there already seem to be superior alternatives.

It is a pain in the ass currently to GET bitcoin. And if I were to use bitcoin now, as a supporter of the endeavour. I would be forced to take a large loss. 
Now my bitcoin are effectively frozen, until the market price reaches the value I placed on them. If people aren't using bitcoin, it has less utility and less value. 
Although a company could use bitcoin and directly exchange them in a matter of an hour or so. 
As a consumer that is far too slow for me to keep money on an exchange, and use to convert to bitcoin when I want to purchase something.

How to check Authenticity of something like this?
Because I can see a HUGE market for copies of something like this?
Buy a legit one.
Make 50 copies. Sell them here there and over there. 50 people wandering around thinking their "bitcoin" (verified on chain and untouched)  is all theirs.
Holograms mean nothing, there is a huge market of counterfit drugs that come out of China, and they have tried everything re: packaging change-ups. If you can make it, so can they.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:07:04
To limit spam attacks.  This is well known.  In the early days of bitcoin, the fee's were nothing, so a block could have been spammed at zero cost.

I understand that there are imperfect fakes. 
But what if I bought a coin. And duplicated it. 
You could check the bits. Coins would be on chain, and unmoved. But I could whip them out from under you at any time. 
And I could sell multiple copies of my "legit" coin. 
A physical object is not that hard to duplicate in this day and age.

@_date: 2019-03-25 19:17:26
That "temporary higher fees" - is completely unnaceptable. Nobody, wants to pay $50 to use their money. Myself and a bunch of other people went to build on a network which isn't going to inevitably stop working. 
And a bunch of businesses had to scrap BTC. You can't make money selling things if the transaction is more than your profit margin. Remember, how for a brief glorious moment it was a payment method on steam? 
Some of us want peer to peer electronic cash. Not banking 2.0 
Hopefully we eventually get both? 
 
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:58:53
Tether USDT, has long been rumoured to be an elaborate scam. No audits have been produced showing the 2.5 Billion USD that backs the tether.  Bitfinex, which also runs Tether (same people) just lost about their fourth banking provider (I'm not really keeping count), and suspended all USD deposits.  
People have started to GTFO of both Bitfinex and Tether (which unfortunatelty is a major trading pair on quite a few online exchanges).  As they flee tether, it is driving up the price of other crypto on the USDT exchanges.  Much like a scramble for lifeboats as the ship sinks. 
This is not a "good" sign.  For Bitcoin, or the crypto market in general. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:47:45
So... The lightning network is free?  And therefore valueless? 
Setting the limit lower, and thus ensuring the value paid to get crammed in there is higher, doesn't make it "More useful". 
Is email valueless because its free?
I agree that perhaps on chain scaling isn't potentially viable longterm.  And maybe yes we do need a second layer.  It just seems absurd to me to freeze the backbone of the entire global payment network (because isn't this what we are striving for?) at 1 mb/10min.

If your developers aren't working on it, to increase the value of the assetts they hold.  Maybe ditch them, and let people who believe in, and use the system work to improve it.  Thats the power of economic insentive.

Well. Kraken's withdrawl fee is at $4.  And doesn't seem like its high enough to actually process on the network right now.  Not awesome.  
I can use Android pay, on my phone, on paywave payment terminals (very common in New Zealand and Australia). Simply unlock phone and tap.  Generally the seller eats visa's 3% fee, and I get 1% cash back.  Hard for crypto to beat that frankly.

Where am I? What is going on... 
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:03:43
Sorry to interrupt. But I would like to know how an block size increase makes a 51% attack easier? My limited understanding thought it would allow more transactions per block, and may limit the ability of some of the more isolated mining operations due to poor data speeds. 
As Mining is centralised in CHINA. And they are authoritarian as fuck. 
I would guarantee that the Chinese govt knows exactly where the mining farms are. And if they wanted to they could shut/down and take over tomorrow. You don't need a warrant to do shit in China. I lived there for a decade. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:11:27
I agree that mining is dangerously centralized.  
I don't see how larger blocks contribute to that. 
The way I see it, it would greatly aid decentralization if people like myself - who have spent $2000 on a computer with a graphics card - can mine. 
That way, someone with the sunk costs already on a gaming PC, and unlimited bandwidth, can put pressure on commercial mining.
My understanding is that some of the Chinese mining operations are located in very out of the way area's and the connection latency is poor. Thus larger blocks would disadvantage them.  
In the age of 2TB hard disks costing a few bucks, what does 1mb mean vs 2mb?  Not much at all to me....

You should not put ANY more into crypto than you are prepared to lose. 
Even bitcoin, the mighty, oldest crypto. Still hasn't solved scaling. And even IF lightning network works as advertised.
This won't solve network security once the the the bitcoin reward drops off. 
Bitcoin is far from a sure bet. And if you don't understand that. You are liable to get wrecked.

How does larger blocks increase centralisation? 
I too think it's a bad scene to have mining centralisation. I think that mining on a home computer should be viable to be truly decentralised. But that boat seems to have sailed for bitcoin.

There are bugger all of the 1000 BTC bars. But I think probably thousands of single btc coins. And a single BTC is A LOT of money these days. 
Way more than the physical object itself costs to produce.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:56:35
I misspelt it.  But that was the first and most famous. 
Since then there have been loads of physical coins made. 
Interesting fetish and collectables.  But given the private key is encased.  There is no way to verify their contents or legitimacy, on the second-hand market.  Even a few of the original sellers have scammed buyers.
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:43:39
I'm quite comfortable with my risk profile thanks. But these kids who took out personal loans in January 2018* (edit) to buy bitcoin aren't doing so well are they? 
Because as it turns out.  When you have a million dollars. Would you prefer to keep your magical internet money, or buy a house? 
Mtgox was the greatest HODL ever. And that sword of damocles hasn't even un-wound yet. 
Also, scaling, and network security after the mining reward drops off? It you think bitcoin is a sure thing, you are misinformed.
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:06:25
Thanks for taking the time to discuss with me. 
I understand that there is no way for my PC to compete with the current mining paradigm - asic miners. 
Which is why I prefer some of the ALT's that are ASIC resistant. And enable someone like myself, with- unlimited bandwidth (eventually free power via solar), to mine, without having to invest in special equipment (I have a gaming PC). Thats more democratic to me, though of course I have to join a pool to be relevant. 
I agree that off chain scaling is inevitable. Segwit seems as good as any to me.
But how do 2mb blocks create more value for miners now? People want to transact, and the memepool overflows from time to time.  The transaction number is finite, infact miners are earning MORE now, as people are forced to pay more to get their transaction to the front of the line, or else wait potentially days.
Eventually miners could earn more via greater transaction volume - but isn't that whole idea - as block rewards trend to zero? 
Personally I'm glad to hear core is working on a 2mb increase, and then Segwit.  Seems like the best of both worlds to me. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:46:44
I simply asked a question. As to how people know they are getting a real one. 
If it's "because they look the same as this picture in a book". Some percentage of them are being scammed IMO. 
If you don't know that's fine. But implying I don't know what I'm talking about, isn't the same as making an argument.
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:58:07
I have a question.  How can you possibly verify a Cassius coin contains its bitcoin. Without breaking the hologram and sweeping the wallet? 
If I were sneaky.  I would buy a Cassius coin. 
Duplicate it.  And sell my "chain of custody" coin, over and over again. 
The only way i get caught. Is if someone opens their coin and sweeps the wallet.  This alerts everyone else (if they are looking), that they've been had. 
There is nothing particularly special about these coins to prevent duplication. And a huge $ incentive to rip them off.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:03:06

How would you be uncovered? That's what I am asking. 
The only way would be if someone destroyed their coin and swept the wallet. Which destroys their perceived value. 
Also you'd have to be watching the address to notice. 
And if you bought it...for btc off someone on the internet.   You are shit out of luck anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:23:47

I was just looking through there.
Brand new accounts selling coins.  There is just no way to verify the coins are legit. 
Unless you peel the hologram, and clear the wallet. 
I could buy a coin. Peel the hologram to get the private key. 
Duplicate that coin several times.  And sell "the same" coin over and over again. 
And I would have chain of custody, and a real coin to base my duplicates off. 
At $8,000 a pop. Believe you me, some place in China is pumping them out.  
They change the holograms on medication regularly, but fake drugs emanate out of southern china as fast as you like.  There is simply nothing special about these coins to prevent copying.  Madness that someone would pay a PREMIUM over their bitcoin value IMO.

@_date: 2019-10-18 03:26:20
Yeah that were shuttered a long time ago. 
I guess this is why govts like China. Keep their denominations low. 
Because the cost to counterfeit a 100rmb note is so high as to make it difficult. 
I was in Hong Kong once, and they just refused to take 500 hkd notes because there were counterfeits around.  
Having a $10,000 physical object is just too much potential for fraud. 
Interesting what you say about the holograms. I know that fake medicine has had no issue reproducing holograms. 
I understand they have a visible public key.  
One thing I thought of. If there was a list and people would publically say if they owned this public key... Then you would know if two people had the same one.  But at the same time, unclaimed keys would be obvious, and a counterfeiter would know they are safe to replicate.

I have spent 10 years in China. 
I went to a lecture given by a guy who uses pollen grains, to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. They originate in southern China, and holograms etc are changed regularly.  Doesn't slow them down. By the rate of change in packaging, you can see the flow of fake medicine spilling across south east asia. 
This is pharmaceutical Giants we are talking about.  And Mike and other people who made these things don't have the same resources. 
If you think these things are physically unreproducible, IMO, you are kidding yourself. We know there are "good" fakes. I'm saying, I think there are probably perfect fakes. And how would you know? You can't know unless you sweep the coin. 
If you and everybody else wants to pay a premium for these things, from a random internet stranger. I asked a question. How would you know it's not a fake and doesn't contain $8000 in bitcoin. 
Got an answer apart from, "nobody could make one that looks the same"?  I'm asking to see if there is something I don't understand about them. 
I have physical bitcoins.  I had to trust that the person who issued it didn't rip me off. I wouldn't buy one second hand from a stranger. That is my point.
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:24:17
I get that. But we all know there was a quick and easy way to prevent the soaring fees.

Segwit only gave a small %. But doubling the block size is a 100% increase in transactions. And it really is a false narrative to say that there is either bandwidth or capacity constraints when we live in the age of ulimited data and 4TB hard drives. 
Yes eventually you hit capacity constraints. Sure 50mb blocks you might run into problems. 
I'm just rehashing the scaling debate with you at this point. I guess we see what is best in the long run.  I'm just annoyed it has come to this. Rather than a compromise where we could have the best of both worlds.

Nono, not making it unlimited. I agree that huge blocks won't do the job. 
But there is a huge gap between 1mb, and 10,000mb. What's wrong with 2mb? It's absurd to artificially constrict the network. 
Why is 1mb so critical? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:17:35
Because they benifit from inflation. Making it superior to fiat. 
One digital token with a fixed or stable supply doesn't seem superior to another. Being unable to spend, strikes me as a net negative. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:51:02
Why not make blocks 100kb? Do you understand where and how the 1mb limit originated. It was an arbitrary number designed to stop ballooning block size when Bitcoin cost nothing. 
It's a hard limit on transaction numbers. And there is no REASON for it to stay. Big blocks don't scale indefinitely. But they sure as hell scale.

Why we can't have both, is quite beyond me? In hardware terms 2mb vs 1mb is so little difference, but it's twice the bandwidth. Why would you voluntarily limit that? Seems like madness. Sure it may never be enough to scale endlessly, and off chain scaling is required. But why is 1mb such a sacred cow?

This is the big question.  The block reward is a subsidy, which is going away. It is supposed to be replaced by fees. 
Bitcoin Core, has locked the block size at 1mb. Meaning there is a transaction limit. To pay for the security (miners), the fees MUST go up.  So that $80,000 per 10 min block will need to be paid transaction fees. What will be the cost to onboard yourself to lightning? $50, $200? 
BCH has not limited the transactions, but it doesnt have enough adoption yet to provide a healthy fee market. 
A couple choices.  High fees low transactions. Or low fees accross high number of transactions.  The money must be paid. 
Or abandon for Nano :P

And its not coming from a place of intellectual superiority. Its flat out greed, when you get down to it. I mean really.  What does it matter if someone questions your favourite coin?  You're worried about FUD and a price drop?

The MTgox refund is surely a sword of damocles over the price of Crypto.  What is it, about 4% of Bitcoin and BCH total supply locked in there? I can't really find firm numbers.  They say they lost 650,000 Bitcoins..
I know people who had 100+ coins on there.  And I imagine when they get some back, they will be hitting the sell button. Quite the emotional roller coaster.  
FUCK I could have been a millionare.  Oh shit, I'm going to get half my coins Back?  I've got $500,000!  I've got $200,000 of crypto, I've got $100,000 of crypto...

I guarantee you some entity in the party knows exactly where all the miners are based in China. And they could roll up tomorrow, and Bitcoin would have a real problem on it's hands. 
They do these "crack downs" leading up to sensitive political events like the party Congress. The big man is consolidating his power, looking like he might go Putin's route. He's been dismantling the ability for the army to generate funds (via rental of land etc) for some time now. 
It's weird living there, in some ways much more free. Have a beer on a street corner and nobody bothers you. It's only when you run into the cold heartless and staggeringly inefficient beuracracy, that you realise how shitty it is to live with the uncertainty within the system.

I've been here for years also. And your conspiracy theory is exactly the same as the anti core one. Except "the bankers/establishment" are on the other team. 
I don't think either side is mostache twirlingly evil. Its a different and valid opinion on scaling. Alot of us left r/Bitcoin because we couldnt even HAVE a discussion or debate because of the censorship. 
And I get it, hashing out the same arguments again and again is tiresome. I think the split is best for all, anti fragile and all that.  But it would be nice if a bunch of crypto enthusiasts would stop slinging mud and bizzzare consipiracy theories, about open source voluntary software.
Ultimately both sides have alot more in common with each other than they do with anyone involved in the legacy system.  Everyone should just chill the fuck out and follow their own chain.

@_date: 2017-10-14 12:05:44
Yeah I think that Bitcoin has shown that perhaps the BEST method is to fork. No consensus on scaling for YEARS, is simply not a fast enough rate of change to perform in the modern world. 
The governance model of things like dash is interesting and seems to be affective. 
I think we should acknowlege that alot of this anger comes from greed. What does it matter if someone goes and does there own thing. Like I said above, as someone who thinks a 1mb block size is incorrect.I still have so much more in common with you than I do with my local bank manager. 
I wish great success to Bitcoin, in all it's flavours. I think if 2x did choke Bitcoin it would be a disaster for confidence in crypto, and a huge amount of new buyers would be badly hurt financially. I personally don't see the need for it, as we already have BCH, so the big and the small block experiment is already in play. 
All the best. And thanks for not calling me a shill. Good to see civil discussion can still be had.

I really dislike this appeal to authority. That satoshi was some sort of demigod. He was a very smart person. I doubt that he got it all right first time. There are very smart people on both sides of the debate, with valid ideas. 
Its not possible to scale the network to VISA size levels on chain.  Off chain scaling is required. 
Its also a bad idea to arbitrarily hobble network capacity with a 1mb block limit. 
We can keep on having a debate. But satoshi is not an oracle.

I replied to a few others. But this is a no go. China has intense capital controls. 
As a foreigner you must show tax receipts in order to withdraw money. Bitcoin is one of the few methods of moving money out of china left. What was it? 100 billion of capital flight this year? IDK
Chinese citizens can send 50,000USD a year no questions asked, though that is much more difficult than in the past. 
So you could do arbitrage, and you would just end up with alot of RMB. A devaluing currency with a bad investment bomb.... 
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:20:19

All the buying pressure comes from China. And they are more than likely selling onto the US exchanges, which may be depressing price? 
There are only two methods to send cash out of china now. One is buying an insurance instrument in Hong Kong, that locks up 25% of your money. 
The other is bitcoin. 
People in china have SO much cash it's kind of unbelievable. Maybe some Chinese guys believe the halving is going to bump up the price.  Property prices have shot up 30% this year, bit of an asset grab while the currency continues to devalue.

Not to mention it is difficult to send money out of the country. Local chinese people have a $50,000 USD limit per year that they can send overseas.

The wealth gap in a society is the essential difference. The happiest places in the world, such as some pacific islands, Butan - are not wealthy places, and don't have high crime. But they dont have anywhere near the wealth gap as USA. People covet what they see every day. And frankly when the banker across the road gets a million dollar bonus, and you work 3 jobs to barely support your family. That's not "fair" and you cannot say the banker works "harder". 
This inequality IMO leads to society problems like drug abuse. Rather than crush and punish crime / drugs with extra police. Fix the wealth gap.

How does that make sense?  A transaction costs the same be it 100 or 1 bitcoin. Its an input that needs to be verified.

Take a look at successful kickstarter projects, they need to tie into some social media for accountability. Its REAL easy to take bitcoins and run, they're practically designed for it.
Its not april fools anymore by my watch :P

This. You still have to go through the banks and bullshit to buy the Bitcoins. Localbitcoin is cool. But there is only one dude in my city selling. And I think he is ignoring me :(

It's an interesting argument.  But informed consent,  and the fact you are unable to 'not'  pay your taxes.  Is rather  different to hiring a hit man to kill somebody.  You have absolutely no agency or decision making in the former.  Apart from voting,  but in the  US two party system...  
He had other options,  such as relocation. 
I wonder if he had an endgame or was in it for the money at all? Boggles my mind someone had 80 million and housemates.

% charges are the thing that infuriates me most about exisiting banking. Why should Visa take 3% of my earnings to keep score?  Dwolla is offering ~25c per transaction flat.  Surely Bitcoin can do much better.  There is a fair market price per transaction, and that's what it should become. 
If the reality is too expensive, a third party can pop up and provide an aggregation service for micro transactions- if its profitable. 
I dunno, 10c per transaction beats the hell out of options available to me now :)

ahh they don't really mean it, they love me :) They just still can't wrap their heads around the concept. My wife still thinks its crazy. But I talked a couple of buddies into getting on the ride.

I'd have to agree with Spodie here. Sure you can divide them up as small as you like. But you cannot create MORE, thereby diluting the value of those who already hold the items. 
Think of it like this. There is a loaf of sliced bread. There are 12 of you, you get a slice each. Now someone invents the knife, and now you can cut up your slice of bread into smaller pieces.  You've still got one slice of bread my friend.

You have 21 million bitcoins. Divide all resources by 21 million. It may be a stepping stone to a resource based economy. At least it sidesteps the financial sector, which is basically a huge cancer feeding on economies, creating nothing of tangible value.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:27:21
I think it's a great idea. But bit coins are still pains in the ass to get hold of. See 8000 que for MTgox.
And (maybe not if you live in the USA) but I incurred more bank fees in getting bitcoins than I would ever save in using them. 
Short of the capital gains, which is other peoples money and not a really great reason to buy into a currency.

I thought my way out of the box, it doesn't create extra wealth. Because the bitcoin buyer can exhange it back to other fiat money. Its just a medium of exchange really. 
Hopefully we reach a stable value (glances across) Up 20 in one day.  Bjesus.

Thats interesting. But just as much of a rip-off as regular credit cards.  Don't use bitcoins - cut out the middle man :P
@_date: 2013-09-11 08:22:34
Not just specifically you, but the whole system. 
You can't comprehend why someone would think a guaranteed 15% income - using an anonymous decentralised currency - doesn't just scream SCAM? 
Even if it was legit, do you not have friends and family? Why would you offer this sure thing to Internet strangers. 
Goodluck, you just won't be convincing me anytime. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:45:07
Not to mention cheats. There is an industry that supplies marked decks, and various contraptions - someone is using them.
And if you think that your skill could beat a card sharp, you are sadly mistaken. In Macau they 'had' (probably still do) ringer dealers who would make sure the right people won big, and too much money didn't walk out.
The opportunity for collusion between players, ESPECIALLY online is way too big. Even knowing where one extra card is a good edge. I would NEVER put any real money into cards. Online or off. 
Not to insinuate winners are cheats, of course they aren't all. But some of them are.
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:31:58
Of course they would switch. It's just basic economics. 
They're getting mothered by the new hardware, its basically pointless to use a GPU to mine bitcoin now. Why wouldn't a rational human switch to litecoin and see if the hyperbol in value kicks off again.
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:02:35
I have wanted to buy into bitcoin since it hit 15 USD. I don't live in the USA however, it is very hard to get them. I have finally got my account verified. I also introduced it to two other friends. We are all still trying to buy in.
The ride certainly isn't over yet. If the lag from our point of view is anything to go by.
You can imagine my chagrin as I watch the price rise every day, and now streak skyward.
Fuck the banks people, let's bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:01:04
Thats true, but the value is completely arbitrary. Even when they were $5 a coin, the miners were still happily beavering away. Having the value set by "what the market feels like' is kinda scary. Its going to bounce like a yo-yo, and people are going to get stung. 
Its going to be a wild ride.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:16:36
lol, more to the point what does -$70 at the bank mean. That has some serious legal ramifications. Like loss of your house.

It IS being increased in value, by people buying into it with USD. And in the end currency is about faith in the system. People are vaguely rational, I don't think someone who bought at $40 is going to sell at $20. A new ceiling will be established.

Me too - no access from China. On a side note, random bar in China this evening - Overhear German guy telling American and Chinese friend about bitcoin - gave him a high five "preach it brother!".

There is a short story called manna that describes it well (in my opinion). You get a group of people together, buy a huge area of land in Australia, or maybe it starts in a small country. 
People can go there on holiday, see the standard of life difference. It needs a high level of robotics to function, the idea is that humans are free to pursue their passions. 
Edit link [manna]( the last few chapters describe a society I could get behind. The first few chapters are the robotic revolution gone wrong.

I don't know - bitcoins are so "anon" - I wouldn't  trust many people with holding large amounts of them for me.  They are basically the easiest bank heist in the history of bank heists waiting to happen.

They're both incredibly risky, one system flaw or relevant technological breakthrough and its all poof. Litecoin taking off would certainly curtail Bitcoins value though.
