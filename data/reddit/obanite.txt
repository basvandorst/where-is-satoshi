It took longer, because the first guy didn't know how to do it. If he'd have known, about the same as with a pinpas, but easier for me (just scan the QR code and hit "Send").
Paying with Bitcoin on Thuisbezorgd is definitely faster than with iDEAL. :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:44:26
Yep! I'm going to buy some more BTC and keep it topped up for pizza funds, because you don't get hit with the 1 EUR transaction fee if you pay with BTC. I like Thuisbezorgd.

It isn't what I'd call a supermarket, it's an average sized Spar shop. So more like a Tesco Metro. I could buy fresh meat and bread there.

But couldn't the IRS make a tool to follow these kinds of chains to an address?
And can't they confiscate your hardware and force you to hand over any encryption keys, eventually proving you own an address?

I switched to Macbooks after years of Windows laptops at the end of 2012 (bought a 2012 Macbook Air).
As a developer, it is definitely simpler to use and superior to a Windows machine:
* Terminal - a complete pre-installed *nix shell with a *nix filesystem (compare to the numerous fragmented, semi-functional options on Windows like cygwin or git-bash)
* Build tools - don't you just hate it when that npm package you really need won't work on Windows because you don't have some stupid build tool installed/configured? It's nice on Mac OS X that you can ./configure and ./make pretty much everything from the open source world without too much hassle
* Stable and fast - I can reboot my machine in seconds. I can sleep/restore my machine in seconds. It stays stable and responsive for multiple months at a time. Rails starts up in &lt;1 second. (Granted some of this is due to the SSD; but equivalent windows laptops with SSD's cost the same as a MBA; go figure)
* Awesome battery life
* IT JUST FREAKING WORKS. My MBA doesn't throw obstacles in my way or slow me down with buggy, crappy, bloated filesystem explorers. I get on with my job and my life.
I'm definitely not an Apple fanboy. I own an Android phone and nothing else Apple. But I love my Macbook Air. :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 08:09:06
This is it. It took me some time to get used to my MBA when I switched from Windows, but it was worth it.

Nice :) I'll definitely be back at some point, we sometimes eat out in Arnhem.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:07:55
Following from the submission a week or two ago about Arnhem ("Bitcoin city") now having a grocery shop that accepts Bitcoin in the city centre... I realised this morning I'd left my wallet in my gf's car, so me and the 1 year old drove into Arnhem center, parked up and found the Spar. Sure enough there was a "Accepts Bitcoin" sign in the door and on the registers.
It's a smallish convenience store, so you'd get bored quite quickly if you got all your food there, but it's entirely possible to live off it if you needed to...
Guy at the checkout needed to call his colleague over to show him how to accept it, so I guess they don't get that many purchases in BTC yet. Hope it picks up for them. Overall the process was easy and convenient, although I don't actually live in Arnhem. (More convenient would be not forgetting my wallet...)
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:22:29
No, it's an insurance scheme. The banks pay into an insurance policy, and if something goes wrong, they claim from the insurance to pay it back. It's like professional liability insurance.
I think you're thinking of the bank bailouts, another thing altogether.

@_date: 2014-04-28 14:31:22
Just started up mine again. 290,000 blocks behind, I've got some catching up to do!
I think one reason there are less nodes is the advent of decent wallets that don't need to sync the blockchain to use them. Not sure what the answer is there.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:27:00
As a (relatively) rational hobbyist miner, I got out of the BTC mining game after my last group buy was delayed by a few months. I do not consider it a rational choice for anyone to get into BTC mining now unless they have access to the very latest hardware as it comes off the assembly line.

So annoyed that the Amsterdam gemeente has decided *not* to enforce the wiet pas laws, right?

Thanks for the tip! I tried it a few weeks back after the news and was disappointed it didn't work for me (I'm in the Netherlands), I can confirm if I try to book via the .com site I get the pay with BTC option.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:26:56
I saw they used bitkassa.nl on an iPad. Used the Coinbase wallet app on my phone to pay. Yeah, zero confirmations I think. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:30:30
LOL, that's hilarious. No wonder they're being investigated.
Sounds like the best course is to let this bunny fail, hard, and reboot with other exchanges that aren't run by amateurs. Everyone will be better off in the end.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:53:27
I think I'm going to do exactly this. Two of my mining cooperative group buys failed to give me ROI in Bitcoin so I'm out of mining BTC for good now, that was half of the attraction of Bitcoin for me. And where I work my colleague has a Doge poster on the wall I see everyday.
Time for some Doge!

For a developer like myself they are very intuitive compared to using a Windows command prompt or cygwin. Despite being a command line shell, it's surprisingly good at following the "principle of least surprise".
Even though I first learned MS-DOS before I even knew what UNIX was, UNIX is much more consistent and user friendly.
Of course, not for non-technical people.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:07:14
I love Linux and use it often at work, desktop and server. But I'm afraid I have to disagree on this point:


In my experience, the desktop experience is still more polished on OS X than Linux UI's.
Also, one I forgot to mention, and as a web dev I can never get around this one: Photoshop. Yes, not something "good" about Apple, but something harder to work around on Linux systems.

I agree FWIW. Bitcoin is one of the battlegrounds for a fair society today. Being inspired by the civil rights movement is not a bad thing.

Depends on what kind of bank it is. There's a big variety.
Besides, you could say the same about Bitcoin exchanges, and businesses in general!
Risk is not something that becomes greater or lesser because of the kind of currency you use, it's because of the institutions, companies and people that facilitate that currency.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:26:06
Nope, they accepted it immediately. The first guy knew they accepted it but didn't know how to process it, second guy did. Overall I got the impression it was something that didn't happen very often, but they acted pretty normally.
No idea who else has been paying that way in that shop.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:31:49
That's great -- and I totally agree that's a valid alternative. I was more speaking about my personal experience and needs. These days I am way over spending lots of time customizing, setting up, fixing, configuring. I just want to get my shit done in the most pain free, time efficient way. I want to focus on what's important: building good quality software in a time that satisfies my clients and doesn't get in the way of my free time. (I have kids :D)
Thus for me, to be able to buy a MBA, take it home, and get straight to work with it was worth the learning curve of a new OS.

They can't prove anything you don't declare, but if they suspect you have a large holding you're not declaring, they can audit you.

Given the number the feds did on DPR, I reckon the authorities are already better at this sort of thing than most people would give them credit for.
Whether the *Dutch* tax authorities are better at it is another matter, but I would think if they added BTC to the tax declaration, they must also have considered enforcement procedures too.

I think you're selectively quoting from Wikipedia. From the very first paragraph [1]: "A computer is a **general purpose device** that can be **programmed** to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a **sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem**."
If you follow the citation, your quote comes from "thefreedictionary.com". If you compare this to more reputable dictionaries you will see a semantic difference. [2]
I know it's arguing over semantics but hey.

Thanks. My point was that a website being down or misconfigured doesn't in any way imply some kind of pan-government conspiracy.
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:32:09


@_date: 2013-05-16 07:13:57
I know right. Just read this on Pandodaily:
"If you try to get to  you get a “502 Bad Gateway” message or a blank screen. It may be a coordinated effort among governments as people from Holland, Israel, the United Kingdom, Italy, India, Canada, Egypt, Brazil, Australia, and elsewhere report the same lack of access to the site."
So when a website goes down, it's a "coordinated effort among governments"? Or maybe it's just... that the website is down. Fucking hell.

When you say that there's no guarantee the ASIC miner will be profitable, can you explain your reasoning? Is it because the exchange rate of bitcoins might go right down again, or because of the difficulty increasing?
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:45:56
I've lived in Australia and there are definitely advantages, but the nanny state &amp; censorship thing is in full swing there, too.
Personally I like where I am now: The Netherlands. It also has its problems with Internet blocking and domestic spying, and taxes are high, but overall it has a lot going for it too, and Dutch isn't so hard to learn if you dedicate yourself to it!
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:16:24
I agree. I should note that I did not even consider selling. If you truly believe in Bitcoin, you will put the money you can afford to lose into it, and keep it there.
 is a great site to visualise this process. :)

So I just found a group order at 2.7 BC / unit. At 300 MH/sec I'd earn what, 0.1 BC/week from them? So break even in more than half a year?
Is this right, or was the group buy I found much too expensive?
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:10:47
Haha same. I mined like 0.2 BTC and thought it wasn't worth it. Should have left going!
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:09:31
No, I didn't factor in electricity costs, just the hash rate. I also read on BTCTalk other people had calculated for ASICMiner's blades the same thing, more or less: that you *might* break even in 6-8 months. If you were lucky.

Why do you expect LTC to have any value while BTC is going mainstream?
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:56:06
I don't understand the 'difficult to secure your wallet'.
I'm much like you, I recently decided to give Bitcoin a try. I went to the official site and downloaded the official client (Bitcoin-Qt). In there is an option called 'Encrypt my wallet' that requires you to enter a decent passphrase. (Settings-&gt;Encrypt wallet).
I managed to find this without any Googling. Are you sure you're not overthinking this? Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:31:45
Looks awesome! Congratulations.

RE News sources: I used to work at an investment bank, and the two big ones for financial news were Reuters and Bloomberg. Those companies provide tons of data as well as just news. Bloomberg even has their own hardware.

I have some money in Plus500 (though I'm going to take it out and buy real shares because I don't like the 1:10 gearing there), some BTC in CoinLenders, some BTC in a mining co-op, a couple of coins in my wallet and some savings in euros.
Diversification = risk management.

Not really the biggest risk your business will be taking. Successful business is 10% idea, 90% execution.
And this will only be a problem if you're hiring developers with no online reputation completely outside of your network, right?
I've only been approached once to build an exchange :( Must be too low profile, hehe.
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:31:16
You know, officially it is pretty much the same symbol, but I was in Thailand a couple of months back and I didn't see it written like that in most places. I just checked the last 20 Baht note I have in my wallet, and I don't see the symbol anywhere on the note (if I remember, they just write "baat" in Thai letters instead).
So technically you're correct -- but in places like the US with growing awareness of BTC, I don't think it'll be a big problem. Maybe something Thai shop owners will have to think about though :)
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:07:01

No, it's not.
If you connect a load of 12V batteries together, it does not make them a supercomputer.
The point Fourdrinier is making is the components need to be able to do *general purpose computing* for it to be a computer, and ASICs are not, no matter how many you chain together.

Stripe is actually one of the easiest to integrate - they have a really nice API, that's one of their biggest selling points.
I can help with integration (I've worked with Paymill before which is almost the same API), it should only take a few hours and I wouldn't mind doing it for Bitcoins. Worth Googling around to find out what Stripe's policy on Bitcoins is though. Message me if you're interested.
