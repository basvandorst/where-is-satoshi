The reason coinbase withdrawals are slow isn't Bitcoin, it's their own wallet software. A transaction sent with the insanely high fees they are charging would almost certainly get in the first block.

Once again, why would it benefit Comcast to make their internet unusable and too expensive for people?

Satellite and LTE are options almost everywhere in the continental US. Besides, how do you think we ended up with a single option in most rural areas? (Hint: Government.)
But besides that, how did everyone on reddit convince themselves that ISPs would do something no one wants all of a sudden? If they are so certain to "block muh Netflix," then why didn't they do this prior to 2013?

Oh stop. [Here]( is an article from 2013 about how Netflix and YouTube make up the majority of the internet's traffic. You mean to tell me **NBC Comcast** was not a media conglomerate in 2013?
If your Comcast line, which is apparently your only option, becomes so unusable, then I am sure 50mbps LTE or Satellite will become an attractive option.

My most recent withdrawal had a $15 fee total from coinbase, block explorer showed a $13 fee on my transaction. Even a $13 fee was quick enough for a fast transaction. 
I agree Coinbase needs segwit, they could take a larger fee for themselves, charge users less, *and* make it way faster. That said, if their wallet software takes 5 hours due to some glitch or liquidity issues, then it doesn't really matter.

We are currently *not* neutral. Large bandwidth providers are getting preferential treatment (discounts) from smaller ISPs. Comcast has refused to give Netflix these preferential discounts.
[Here is an explanation better than one I could provide here.](

Please explain, then.

You need Cocaine, I think. BTC will fail to break 9k and retrace for a few days before breaking 9k with conviction and testing 10k!

Just know that it is likely no one has *your* best interest in mind. NN is assuming one entity *will* have your best interest in mind. (They won't.) This is why Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless.

Did the same thing with 7k and 8k, but who can be sure of anything?
