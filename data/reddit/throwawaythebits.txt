Well _my_ crystal ball says different.
* Dinosaurs walk the earth again.
* A portal to hell swallows most of Australia. 
* Anti-Trump sentiment leads to the adoption of a new cryptocurrency, the GroverCoin.
* Grover Coin explodes in popularity because Putin puts a picture of his wallet balance on his MySpace page.
* Mass confusion ensues over whether GroverCoin is named for Grover Cleveland or Grover from Sesame Street, leading to a hard fork that will cause millions to become destitute.
* says "hodl" about five million times.

But you aren't taking any gains if you don't sell. And a crash is not a dip. It most likely leads to a bear market, and there you aren't even making paper gains. You're losing by any definition when we get there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:09:07
Even if you are hoping for bitcoin to replace fiat currency (which is what I assume you mean by "revolution"), the price of bitcoin matters. If bitcoin is shorted to hell -- and I'm not saying it will, but that's one plausible view on the outcome -- then its value will decrease in the public eye. 
Good luck starting a revolution with a currency nobody believes is worth anything. At a certain point you might as well be trying to replace USD with Zimbabwean dollars.

You're still missing the point of the meme, but that's a silly argument I won't pursue anymore.


That is a huge "if."


I'd like to see numbers on that, if you have them. 


It _has_ to slow down. Even accounting for the recent dip, this rate of growth is wholly unsustainable and absolutely must stop. At this rate Bitcoin would be worth over a million dollars within about six months. Do you really believe that's possible? Or that it would have anything to do with adoption if, by some absurd series of events, that did happen?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:56:30
* Price gets driven up by rampant speculation.
* As price goes up, more and more people want in on the action, viewing the rise as inexorable.
* Something happens, like a really large sell or major exchange problems.
* Panic selling begins as newcomers to the market worry that they've made a bad decision or try to recuperate losses. Remember also that at this point in a bubble, many people will have put a lot more in than they should have.
* As more strong-willed people see the price begin to tank, they too start to sell, which keeps pushing the price downwards.
Somewhere, it bottoms out, and you hope it comes back up again. Odds are that if you have any left, you'll forget you even own any Bitcoin for the next few years of a bear market.
To apply it more specifically to the current situation, you can clearly see the euphoria. Tons of people think Bitcoin is going to keep going up until it's worth a million USD/coin, and are evangelizing, which is pretty much just mania. The price hasn't really plummeted yet, but one look at the order book should raise some red flags.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:48:46


Yes it does, because the entire point of it is that Bitcoin is the new currency. Nobody will need to trade it for millions because there will be more value in cryptocurrency than fiat, in this hypothetical.


Who, exactly? I've been hearing this said for years, but all I ever hear about are major vendors that are dropping crypto support.

That's kind of a non-answer. FUD has a specific meaning, and while I guess you could argue that there's always some baseline level of it around, there's a _lot_ of it right now. Currently it surrounds the steadily-declining price and uncertainty posed by forthcoming futures markets.
What I'm asking is why you decided to buy in now as opposed to waiting for this to resolve a little, which it will in a couple of weeks when it's somewhat clearer what futures are actually going to do.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:58:07
On the whole, I'd say technical analysis works, but not as well as it might in other markets. Some indicators work reasonably well. Many don't work at all. 
I would suggest learning the basics and not getting too fancy with it. Learn basic patterns (but don't try to call them until they're actually resolved, which is a very common mistake), learn Bollinger bands, and learn the significance of moving averages, volume, and MACD. Fancy techniques, in my experience, are not super reliable for predicting bitcoin.
As for swing trading, my advice is to be extremely careful with it. It tends to blow up in your face.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:08:28
Nobody is saying "Bitcoin is about to die." It can crash and recover after a few years of a bear market, as we've seen. But that has no bearing on whether this is or is not another bubble.

I've also been around for about that long, but our time doing this really holds no weight in terms of our ability to predict what CBOE/CME futures are going to do to the price.
Other than hopefulness, I'm not seeing what you're basing this prediction on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:38:28
You have completely misunderstood the conversation.
We were discussing a hypothetical situation where the price of bitcoin plummets and doesn't recover for, as the OP said, "decades." That implies at least 20 years of media irrelevance at some point in the future.
Also, there is really no need for personal insults.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:30:36
Yes, I've seen the meme, but that's just wishful thinking.
Bitcoin is not poised to replace fiat by any means. Its advantages over fiat right now are pretty slim. The sort of adoption that idea presupposes is unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:59:13
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:44:46
I would wait a little bit, personally. It's fairly unclear what the price is going to do right now. We're actually at a pretty uncertain point at the moment; futures markets are going to open in the coming weeks, and while this will undoubtedly have _some_ impact on the price, we don't yet know what that impact is going to be.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:53:50
So you look at everything else falling along with Bitcoin and take that as a bullish sign? How?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:27:33
You can't guarantee that, and that stance doesn't even really make sense. For every person "investing in the future of Bitcoin" there is another person with a position against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:39:49
Why would you buy in the middle of all this FUD? Wouldn't it have been safer to wait a week or two to gauge the impact of futures?

@_date: 2017-12-09 10:04:39
It's quite a leap to draw that comparison.
Adoption of the Internet didn't require people to change much, fundamentally. Adoption of Bitcoin _as a currency_ requires people to drastically alter the way they handle and see money.
In general, people tend to take their money very seriously, and want to take measures to protect it. People won't trust a way of transacting that they don't understand. The Internet didn't have barriers like this, because there was less need to understand it for it to have hit widespread adoption.

You really think that institutions pushing the price of bitcoin down to the ground to the point where it will take decades to recover is good for bitcoin? How do you expect people to take it seriously as a currency after at least twenty years of being irrelevant?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:16:08
Everybody wants an explanation other than "we went up too much too fast," but that's by far the most likely explanation for the price dropping like it is. Nothing rises like that without coming back down, ever. It's a hard lesson to learn for people new to this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:40:12
A huge portion of the users here hold tightly to a philosophy of blindly holding on to their Bitcoins. This comes from a belief that the price will continue climbing, and that the longer you hold, the more it'll be worth, so why ever cash out? Because they think that Bitcoin will be worth (some arbitrarily huge price) in the future, they view anybody who sells now as foolish.
Then there's some more hardcore types that believe Bitcoin will replace all fiat at some point in the near future. To these people, selling is ridiculous because you should buy Bitcoin and wait until fiat is worthless.
In general, neither of these groups are particularly open to other viewpoints.

@_date: 2017-12-10 09:54:48
I agree. I'm glad that it's going down. Meteoric rises are really unhealthy in any market. I'm far less worried about the long-term now than I was when it was shooting up towards $20000 USD.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:15:00
You make money only if you sell.
You have to sell eventually to realize any gains you have made. At some point, Bitcoin's rise has to stop. That's just common sense. That time may not necessarily be in the near future, but it could be. It will happen, and what then? Keep holding forever until Bitcoin's back down in the double digits again?
It's fine to hold on to what you have and hope it will go up, but if you're in this to make money then it's important to realize that any peak could be the highest one ever.

Ignoring that the white paper is not a prophetic gospel, this says little about what reaching that hypothetical third stage will take. It could be argued that the second stage is "in progress," but I would say to achieve a total replacement of banks we're nowhere remotely close. 
I can put my money in a bank, and be pretty assured it will be there in five year's time, almost intact (minus inflation, countered slightly by interest). If I put my money in Bitcoin right now, nobody can reliably say whether it will be worth five times more or one quarter of what it was. The public at large does not perceive Bitcoin as anything other than something to speculate on. It is nowhere near replacing banks. The size of that hurdle is astronomical.


There's always another milestone to hit, but that too is just speculation, not to mention an event that is still very remote from now. Bitcoin's price could easily drop catastrophically before it deploys to a significant extent, and by then public perception will already be ruined, at the very least for the medium term. 


Snapchat is not intended as an asset, a store of value, or a currency, so this is not pertinent.


If you want to argue about this, please do it in good faith and refrain from making it personal.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:01:54
As the adage goes, past performance is not an indicator of future success.
At some point, the price will fall and not rise substantially again. Why should it be the case that Bitcoin bounces back from where it is now? "It has in the past" is not a reason, something has to drive the price upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:17:38


For the third time, I'm asking you "who?" Where is this adoption, non-anecdotally? All I see on the news are people wondering if bitcoin is a bubble and whether you should throw money at it, but that's speculation, not adoption. I see vendors pulling Bitcoin support for its volatility. I see few, if any, announcements of major vendors or corporations accepting Bitcoin in place of fiat.


You do if you think it's going to fall and never come back up again, which is exactly what happens in panic selling phases.


Spare me the condescension, please. Bitcoin is terribly unsuitable as a new form of money as it is right now. Network congestion, fees, and a learning curve make it challenging to use. Currency needs to be dead simple, easy to use, and widespread, and Bitcoin is none of those things right now.
Maybe an optimist could claim that it will be one day, but it is in no way poised to overtake fiat currency at this point in time.


Bitcoin is in no way the first digital currency, but that's not important here. This doesn't really have a bearing on our discussion. You're suggesting bitcoin will one day be worth millions -- Bitcoin being something that might vaguely resemble a kind of currency that will be widespread, maybe, at some nebulous point in the future does not convince me that it is somehow worth millions of dollars on our current trajectory.


If that were true, we'd never go down, ever.


Or they'll wash their hands of the whole crypto trading thing and go invest in something else. If the price really crashes, you're going to see a lot of people who were pumping bitcoin suddenly turning and claiming it's dead, never to rise again. It's happened before and it will happen again.

Bitcoin has been around for almost a decade now. Calling this "super early adoption" seems like a big stretch.

I'm hating on the article, not OP. I don't recall saying anything about OP.
It says virtually nothing about the progress of the "crypto industry," whatever that is. What it says is that some people were accepting cryptocurrency in Craigslist, so they decided to add a checkbox for it. That's nothing new, as people selling drugs on CL have accepted crypto since 2013 or so. In fact, a quick walk through ~10,000 Craigslist posts in my area shows a whopping 4 posts that have that checkbox ticked.
All of them are selling drugs.

I made no claims whatsoever about adoption. I was talking about market prices. Regardless of how you feel about adoption rates, market movements can be compared regardless of market, and dramatic price increases like that have never been healthy in the history of any market.

@_date: 2017-12-09 10:11:23
Adoption of the Internet didn't take much change, no. People knew how to use computers. People knew how to interact. A new avenue for doing that was provided, and what you could do with it gradually increased. There was a learning curve, but it wasn't that steep.


This is totally irrelevant to the argument I was making. I made no claims for or against Bitcoin's safety as a store of value.


The world doesn't know that, though. Most of the world doesn't think that way. Most of the world keeps their money in the bank, and is happy to do it.


People said stuff like this a lot at the peak of the 2011 and the 2013 bubbles. Bitcoin has grown in awareness since then, but has it grown in adoption as a currency? Not much, if so. In many big ways, adoption has decreased. Bitcoin is a speculative tool right now, and is not viewed by the public as a currency.
If you watch financial news, you'll see that most mainstream coverage never even talks about Bitcoin as if it were a currency at all. They use terms like "digital gold." That's the public perception of it, and adapting to the idea of it as a currency would be a steep curve indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:31:41
It has a lot to do with the time frame of development. Core has had ten years to make Bitcoin viable as currency, and it's not that yet. Since I've been involved this thing, people have constantly claimed that the various flaws in Bitcoin are on the verge of being fixed. Most have not been fixed.
As far as growth, I'd agree that the user base has grown. Adoption... not by much. For years everybody has said that mass adoption is right around the corner, but it never happens.
Is it possible you'll one day be part of the wealthy elite? Sure, but it's not likely. Even if you believe that cryptocurrency is the way of the future, it's really improbable that Bitcoin will be the one that wins out.

It's going to get lower before it gets higher, if it even ever does. Many people will probably soon find themselves with bitcoins worth way less than their initial buy-in.
I know it's going against the mantra here, but blindly holding is a great strategy towards never actually making any money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:41:23
If you want to sell, sell.
This may keep dropping, or it may go back up. It's pretty much a coin flip right now. If you sell now, that uncertainty is removed from your life. If the peace of mind is worth it to you, then just sell and get it over with.
In the worst case, you can buy back in if the price really trends back upwards. In the best case, you know you made the right choice, and you still have your money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:57:01
