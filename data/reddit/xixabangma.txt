I live in Kuala Lumpur &amp; I've been to Bangsar Shopping Centre a few times. Next time around I'll try to check this out.

At least they promised of a Thursday update and true to their words, here comes an update of the updates. 
Much trust. Such fidelity.

Probably the OP bought it long time ago when properties were still affordable. 
I have a simple 900-sqft apt that requires about $250/mo in mortgage, but well, I'm in a 3rd world country so that's just about right.

I live in Kuala Lumpur although I rarely use the city taxi services (they are world infamous for a reason). I'll try to check how exactly this will work though. Perhaps there's a company website or blog that explains it.

Because we are Malaysian. I recall in early days of school when learning English, fishmonger was among the words used during class.

Not much for me. Just an iPhone bumper via online store. Probably about $3 worth. Felt nice to do it regardless.

Way back then, when MtGox was trading at about 20% premium against other exchanges, they said it is because $1goxUSD = $0.80realUSD. Basically it was at a "premium" because of difficulty to exchange to fiat. 
Now when it is trading at a massive discount, the situation is reversed? Just a bit confusing to me.

I'm not in Oz (yet!) but for my current residence in Kuala Lumpur, I used localbitcoins for my recent BTC purchase. Just stick to those 100+ positive rating sellers and they were eager to get things done quickly for more +ve ratings. 
Given my unfavorable location and the possibility of wire-transfering cash (gasp!) to some other country where the exchange is located, the option presented by localbitcoins served my purpose. 
But yeah, if you found BTC ATM, that gotta be the best option.

Practically, how was the ban being imposed? You may not be able to sign up to cable services (just an example) but how did they stop you from, say, getting online at cyber cafe or public library or public college computers? Just wondering. Bet 1995 was crazy different than what it is now in internet years.

That's like saying "we post articles without click-bait titles and without banner ads".
No offense ;-)

Numoni also has an ATM in Kuala Lumpur. Supposedly massive promotion in their FB page as as well BitcoinMalaysia FB page. 
But when I went to the mall, the ATM was no longer there. The guy said Numoni took it back. So I can't even review the ease of using their ATM :-|
Edit: btw, do you know if it can print paper wallet instead? Then the buyer just redeem from the address at home.

No difference than say trading $50 Amazon gift card with $50 eBay gift card, for example. Both aren't legal tender and if you get scammed, don't come crying to Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI).

A Wired journalist was posting earlier about getting insider information from any Gox employees. I suggested him of a bounty and I was downvoted. LOL. 
Anyhow, I'm upvoting you since this idea should be more visible =)
