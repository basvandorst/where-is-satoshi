Appearently someone tries to scam people here...

Hey man, this guy has been posting in Crypto subreddits for 2 days now, he knows his stuff!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:38:42
Is it that time again?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:08:12
Did I just got passively rick-rolled?
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:40:43
i guess a guy with such reddit history is not trying to scam someone on 6 bucks...


thats actually right.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:43:39
I could do it, but that would mean yoe need to trust me...;)
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:47:20
I would recommend you make your own experience...everybody on reddit claims that cloudmining is scam... (i reached ROI on HashFlare a few weeks ago! ;) )
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:17:28
Can only speak for myself, I started using HashFlare around 8 moths ago and it was one of the best decisions so far.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:52:48
If I would be in your situation probably not (not knowing the site). I personally would start out with a smaller amount. But now I would definately do it, yes!
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:24:27
Give me your hand.

It was most likely leveraged.
