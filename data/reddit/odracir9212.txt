Bitcoin will get adopted bc rich/middle class people in poor countries will buy it
Bitcoin price means nothing, the fundamentals havent changed, the end game hasnt changed, and the development has only increased. Look at fucking MimbleWimble, some random guy with thr Voldemort nickname uploaded  fucking genius code that will get implemented in Bitcoin....

You realize that the fees you pay for credit cards are hidden right? The person who accepts it has to pay a % to the credit card company. Theres a reason that after 2008 all credit card companies are worth 10-12x more.
Cash is subject to inflation so you lose value there. Maybe in the US you dont see it as much but poorer countries get raped by inflation.
Currently Bitcoin is a safe store of value that is uncorrelated to anything so its a good hedge for ANY portafolio.

How long do they took? 50 years to discover that? The problem with economics is that it isnt a science, its entirely based upon what the insitutions like Yale, Harvard, Cambridge etc teach their students. Which is capitalism and neoliberalism and disregarding everything else as false, instead of looking at the pros and cons of the major economic theories.
This problem has been growing bigger over the years because people are starting to realize that what MOST of the major economist is never how it works in the real world.

Financial innovation and complexity or as it should be called "scams and ponzi schemes"
There are some obvious winners in the age of financialization: Financial industry managers and shareholders see their incomes grow much more rapidly than other skilled professionals. But corporate managers and wealthy investors also profit as stock prices rise.
Who loses? The poor and the working class don’t have the capital or expertise to take advantage of new investment opportunities. These people suffer disproportionately from layoffs or reductions in salary and benefits — the choices firms make to keep profit margins and stock prices high. Working folks also carry most of the growing debt that is needed to maintain living standards when wages and benefits are stagnant as financialization takes hold.

Gresham's law states that any circulating currency consisting of both "good" and "bad" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the "bad" money. This is because people spending money will hand over the "bad" coins rather than the "good" ones, keeping the "good" ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the artificially overvalued money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save rather than exchange the artificially demoted one....

You do realize the stuff you buy has tax already in it right? Theres many ways to tax people. The most damaging is through inflation(which is what we want to remove). They print more money, that money only goes to the rich, therefore your money is worth less and theirs is worth more.
Also the current system promotes consumerism which is basically destroying the world.

The subjective theory of value is a theory of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends.

Inflation isnt a bad thing. The problem is that the current fiat system is rigged at the top. Corruption is the name of the game. There is no saving the fiat system as history has shown us; every fiat currency eventually died, for usually the same reason....
The first well-known widespread use of paper money was in China during the Tang (618-907 A.D.) dynasty around 800 A.D. Paper money spread to the city of Tabriz, Persia in 1294 and to parts of India and Japan between 1319 to 1331. However, its use was very short-lived in these regions. In Persia, the merchants refused to recognize the new money, thus bringing trade to a standstill. By 1455, after over 600 years, the Chinese abandoned paper money due to numerous problems of over issuance and hyperinflation.
For example.
The median age for a live currency is 37 years and at least one, the Zimbabwe dollar, is in the throes of hyperinflation.
Excluding the early paper currencies of China up until the 15th century and the majority of paper currencies that existed in China until 1935, there are 609 currencies no longer in circulation. Of these, at least 153 were destroyed as a result of hyperinflation caused by over-issuance. The remainder were revalued, destroyed by military occupation/liberation, renamed for political reasons, or were converted to another currency. The median age for these currencies is only seventeen years.

Well the problem with that is that banks are the ones stealing it. SO for them its very easy to steal your funds...

First of all Bitcoin is a fucking protocol. You can build whatever the fuck you want on top of it.
Bitcoin is also medium of exchange, a unit of accounting, and a store of value. Therfore it can be considered money. Basic economics retard.
You fail to take into account that being a "currency" is just an "app" of Bitcoin, it takes very little mind power to see that. and maybe you dont have enough brain power to see beyond "currency" but I guess you cant fix stupid.
You remind me of the retards that said that the internet had no value because "who wants to send an email to somebody on the other side of the world"
Bitcoin brings freedom of speech to everyone, and just like the internet connected half the world, Bitcoin will connect the other half.

Theres a lot of "accepted" theories in economics that when applied to the real world dont really work....
Debt-based money has fucked the system pretty hard...
You also have to take in account how many bitcoins are actually in the market? Because if theres a small amount then prices will rise very fast due to limited supply...

Yes.... why do you think 80% of Trumps cabinet is made of multimillionaires?


The government has passed a lot of laws deregulating industries.. deregulation in Wall Street, deregulation in the oil industry, deregulation in the pharma industry, deregulation in the food industry... and what has that resulted in? Corporations fucking us.
Yes I agree with Peter Schiff...but you do realize that the government and big coporations are on the same side??

I dont understand what your point is.
Before the problem was that people didnt know what Bitcoin can do... now they are starting to understand and thats why value is going up.

They never went to the Middle East to control the oil supplies and werent interested in proxy wars with Russia. They also never used the CIA to fund coups in Latin America... They also never build the strongest military in the world and also the "strongest" cyber army in the world.
As I said before keep living in your fantasy world where data is useless
Step 1: Data Selection Consider what data is available, what data is missing and what data can be removed.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing Organize your selected data by formatting, cleaning and sampling from it.
Step 3: Data Transformation Transform preprocessed data ready for machine learning by engineering features using scaling, attribute decomposition and attribute aggregation.
I assume they use the same methods as Facebook/Google

As I said their purpose could be the same as COINTELPRO (which lasted almost 20 years btw)

Disprove this:
Operation Northwood
GULF OF TONKIN INCIDENT
ETERNAL BLUE (SHADOWBROKERS LEAK)
Operation Mockingbird: CIA infiltrated media organization to further their own agenda.


The NSA collects data from all over the world and not just phone calls fucking moron stop saying that. They collect internet searches, what sites you browse, how long, who do you call, what you write, where do you go, medical records, finance records etc.
The NSA unleashed STUXNET on Iran nuclear reactors so yeah what do you think that was about?!
get that through your thick troll skull
COINTELPRO (an acronym for COunter INTELligence PROgram) was a series of covert, and at times illegal,[1][2] projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic political organizations.[3] [4] FBI records show that COINTELPRO resources targeted groups and individuals that the FBI deemed subversive,[5] including anti-Vietnam War organizers, activists of the Civil Rights Movement or Black Power movement (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Black Panther Party), feminist organizations, independence movements (such as Puerto Rican independence groups like the Young Lords), and a variety of organizations that were part of the broader New Left.

So why didnt anyone leaked PRISM before Snowden huh? Look at the fucking NSA tools that were leaked last year.. remember STUXNET? Remember WANNACRY? Remember NOPETYA? Those weapons were developed from the NSA arsenal.
Why you keep bringing phone numbers? They store data retard. All of the data they can collect is stored then they run that through their machine learning algorithms to improve them....

Market systems work for 90% who are productive, but not the 10% who aren't and will never be. Negative income tax, not socialism, is a solution. Give people money (power) to choose their own services. Don't just give them public school, give them the $14k/yr per student that we're spending and let them spend it themselves.
Do you read what you write? If we reduce the power of the government whats going to stop corporation from fucking us?
Last time I checked most big corporations are already fucking us pretty hard despite all the regulations... 
Polluting our water, stealing our money, destroying the enviroment, abusing the poor, etc etc
Yes, lets give them money and privatize everything, because that has worked so well...


Centralizing spending power at the gov't level is the polar opposite of what you want. Think. This. Through
You do understand that socialism DOESNT mean giving the government all the power right?
Thats a false stastistic but whatever.
The problem is that the ones in the top the .01% are the ones that are NOT paying the fucking taxes. Thats the whole point of this. Corporations which are people DO NOT pay the taxes that they should. See Walmart, see Apple, see Amazon etc etc
1 vote pero people haha you are naive. The only thing that matters in a election is how much money you can donate to buy advertisments.. thats what gets the votes. People are too brainwashed to think for themselves.


Yes because consensual transactions without a third party checking work so well right?

Watch Andreas Antonop explaining why this is a revolution or read his book, he can explain it way better than most people here
Or read Jameson Lopp posts
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:29:41
A revolutionary technology that has made worldwide transfers of wealth possible to any individual with internet access at any time of the day without the need for an intermediary for 9 years...
Plus being the most secure network in the world...
Plus having unlimited growth potential
Plus spawning a huge  disruptive industry...
You should learn a bit about what Bitcoin is and what it has accomplished...
I reccomend that you at least watch some of Andreas Antonop videos on youtube...

You are a fucking troll. What would you do if you had all the data in the world? Take advantage of it? Use it to further your own agenda? Use it to mess with other governments? Use it to exploit people? Use it to intimidate others? Use it to bribe others? Use it to  blackmail others? Use it to CONTROL others?

@_date: 2017-11-10 11:24:54
Bitcoin can move slowly because there are a ton of projects in crypto and more being born every day... 
Bitcoin is at the front and it cant afford to make a single mistake...
Remember that turtle/hare story? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:01:13
AI will manage most cryptocurrencies, allocating resources to where its needed the most. All transactions registred in the  blockchain so everyone can verify it works as intenteded.

Why do you think that it wouldnt?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:53:51
Yeah  but bitcoin is like oil in its early days. People where buying all the land that had a chance to have oil even if they couldnt even use it 
Those people ran the world for a long time due to having the oil
Maybe this time it will be bitcoiners who will run the world

Try so send money through Moneygram or WesterUnion... they charge upwards of 20 eur for a 100 eur transaction... 
Those are high fees....
Bank money overseas.... 6-7% of the amount. 
Those are high fees.
Bitcoin will have one day really small fees, it will take time but we will get there
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:50:03
The same thing that happened in the dotcom "bubble" will happen with crypto.... the only difference is that now the value is in the protocol ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:59
You fail to understand the way the blockchain in Bitcoin is produced. You need a lot of hash power. Bitcoin is the strongest network there is... thats not easy to replicate
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:36:18
Is it normal that the orderbook doesnt have a lot or btc on the other side?

Well with Bitcoin you have financial freedom. Everyone is free to participate.
Remember Bitcoin is code and it evolves 24/7
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:49:34
Well we usually dont see S curves in stocks because you cant invest in pre-IPO... so most of the time everyone misses on this exponential gains except the rich .01%
Bitcoin is starting the S curve and anyone can invest in it.
It is also a global asset with unlimited potential... Id say its a better invention than Google, Facebook and Amazon together
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:13:55


Some of the smartest minds in the world are working for free on Bitoin for very good reasons. I recommend watching Andreas Antonopolous talks in youtube/or read his book on Bitcoin.
It seems that everyone working on it agrees that it will disrupt change the world. That consensus means a lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:33:14
You realize that in the current system only rich people have access to capital right?
Most of the world population has no banking services... meaning they cant get out of poverty because they are cut off from the system
Hopefully Bitcoin changes that in the next 10 years
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:06:54
Things are improving because each year more and more people have access to technology,
the problem is that the living standard for middle and lower class people in developed countires has stopped getting better... for example, wages in the US havent moved sine 1970...
But the surprising thing is that the wealth for the top .01% has kept increasing exponentially... thats the problem...
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:20:25
Dont forget that Bitcoin is always under development and the adoption is increasing... 
Also when speed and fees are fixed.... what do you think will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:56:05
They just need a cellphone. Easier than putting a bank there. Which will never happen because banks dont give a shit about Africa
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:02:52
AH finally there it is. The greatest logical fallacy of all capitalist lovers.. If you are a multi millionaire then its because you are successful, if you are poor its because you are a failure...


And how will individuals have more power ?
There are regulations that do protect us... you think corporations would regulate themselves?
Capitalism is the  extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all....
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:28:52
Well thats just tells me you are one of the so called "useful idiots", poor and uneducated... but somehow supporting of the "masters"
Did you not see how much fucking money corporations and rich people are hiding overseas? Im sure it will trickle down in the next year /s
The rich make.money by using infraestructure paid with our taxes.... but they avoid the responsability of giving back....
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:44:05
Well they keep increasing the debt limit... people are starting to wonder if they will be able to keep paying.... remember every fiat currency has gond to 0 in the long run
Theres a reason countries like China have stopped buying US bonds...
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:58:07
You have a great way of explaining stuff. Thank you.
Sadly they do no understand neither capitalism nor socialism and they do not want to, they only think what the TV told them to think.
Most schools in the world are based on the Prussian model, basically they were meant to make soldiers, slaves, zombies, that obey the commands of the state. Its going to be very hard to change their way of thinking.

Do you know where I can find real big blocks vs LN discussion?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:25:37
You still fail to give any evidence for any of your arguments...
How can something that revolutionizes the way you interact with money be worthless? I dont understand that. 
I can send any amount of money to anyone at anytime with barely any fees and depending on the network it can be very fast. (Lightining network is coming to fix that)
To me that has value.
You can also program the money, even machines can own money now. The possibilities are endless. You have to be either really old or really naive to not see where the future is headed.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:32:40
You asked me what can they do with data. I showd you what they did in the 50s. You think they are not doing the same shit now ? I guess we will now in a few more years. 
So you are saying the NSA just developed tools to hack into the SWIFT banking network just to protect people? You are telling me they developed cyber weapons like STUXNET and ETERNAL BLUE that could render useless entire countries just for fun?
You fail at trolling
The same way Google feeda their algorithms wirh our data to improve their search functions... the NSA can use our data for whatever they want. To predict certain events, to detect certain events, to increase their efficiency....
Just like with cointelpro their purposes are usually to subvert groups that they deem "bad"
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:43:07
Are this the same smart fund managers predicted any of the previous crashes? Or are they the ones who profited from.them? Basically taking our.money because they had more information and could bet against us first.... gotta love those people
I find it strange that suddenly all this rich people care about people losing money in a 150bill dollar market, when that is basically chump change.
Andreas explains it very well in its talk "the 5 stages of grief banking edition"
How bankers react is very similar to the way Kodak, Blockbuster, Barnes and nobles reacted when faced with new tech

Bitcoin is a religion. Tbh once you really understand it you see the potential it has to change the world and actually make it a better place.... The good thing is that as Bitcoin brings more monetary gains more people will get into it which will also bring more developers which means the tech can advance faster and faster

Yeah the world economy is not looking well, the developed nations have stopped consuming at the rate greedy corporations need people to consume. Thats why they are moving to developing nations, and thats why Trump is in power, to give them what they want or they keep leaving and closing shop in the US for example.
Capitalism needs the wheels to be ever turning no matter if the consequence of doing that is the destruction of the world. You either become a consumer or you get consumed.

Institutions that acquire power tend to use it to gain even more power, but whatever


No... what about making it so that big corporation need to incoporate workes into their board of directors like they do in countries like Germany.... What about destroying the current oligopoly in the US?


You must be trolling but ok. The problem with inequality is that it concentrates power in the hands of the few... do you want a dictatorship? Because thats how you get one.
Our quality of live has improved that is true, but at least in America it seems after 1970 things have just stayed the same for the average american...


Why do you support a system that you are not part of ? It blows my mind.
If being rich was due to skill I wouldnt give a fuck, but currently the ultra rich are basically gaming the system to extract wealth from everyone else....

Like Carlos Slima having a monopoly on telecom services and bribing the government and stealing from the mexican people?
Like Armancio Ortega profiting from slave made clothing?

Id argue that with Bitcoin you regain the rights that cash gave us before. You remember those times? Back then when not every transaction we ever made was registred in a data base and then sold to other companies so they can have our information and sell us more things?
Before the NSA, CIA and all intelligence agency could monitor everything, because everything is tied to our money...
I want to go back to those days.


When a valuable asset is discovered, like oil, everyone rushes to buy land that has oil, could have oil, maybe has oil, has very deep oil, and they are all traded until their price is agreed. Then the owners exploit this oil and sell it to the masses. With Bitcoin everyone can buy oil, not only the richest of the rich, or the lucky ones, or the privileged ones, everyone can get it and earn it with their work.

Subsection 1(a)(i) of  E.O. 13808 prohibits engaging in transactions related to, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in new debt with a maturity of longer than 90 days by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of PdVSA, its property, or its interests in property.
Subsection 1(a)(ii) of E.O. 13808 prohibits engaging in transactions related to, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in new debt with a maturity of longer than 30 days issued by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of any other segment of the Government of Venezuela, its property, or its interests in property. That subsection further prohibits engaging in transactions related to, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in new equity issued by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of the Government of Venezuela, its property, or its interests in property, which includes PdVSA.
Subsection 1(a)(iii) of E.O. 13808 prohibits engaging in transactions involving bonds issued by the Government of Venezuela prior to the order's effective date.
Subsection 1(a)(iv) of E.O. 13808 prohibits engaging in transactions involving dividend payments or other distributions of profits to the Government of Venezuela by any entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Government of Venezuela.
Section 1(b) of E.O. 13808 prohibits purchasing any securities from the Government of Venezuela other than securities qualifying as new debt with a maturity of less than or equal to 90 days (for PdVSA) or 30 days (for the rest of the Government of Venezuela).
These actions prohibit transactions by U.S. persons as defined in E.O. 13808, wherever they are located, and transactions within the United States. This action does not require U.S. persons to block the property or interests in property of the Government of Venezuela, and the Government of Venezuela will not be added to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List). U.S. persons should reject transactions or dealings that are prohibited by E.O. 13808, and to the extent required by Section 501.604 of the Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations (31 C.F.R. part 501), U.S. persons must report to OFAC any rejected transactions within 10 business days.

Countries are already at war with cash anyways.


Just like any electronic system that we depend on, including banks...


Have you ever send money overseas? Its expensive as fuck(5-8%)


Have you ever send money overseas? Its slow as fuck(can take days)


We dont need third party safe-keepers thats the whole point of the blockchain. Also, decentralized exchanges...

The ad Venezuelum fallacy wears many different masks but they are all the same once you remove the packaging. Whether it’s a meme or some fancy-pants article in the National Review, the implied reasoning is: if economies fail as a result of bad economic ideas &amp; if Venezuela’s economy is failing, then socialism is a bad idea. 
In 1992, Zimbabwe — a capitalist country — watched as its manufacturing output dropped by half, dragging real wages with it. After cutting social spending, privatizing public infrastructure, &amp; opening their markets to foreign capital, Zimbabwe’s inflation skyrocketed while growth stagnated. By ’98, their economy went into free fall &amp; their currency devalued by over 80%. By 2002, 60–70% were under the poverty line, life expectancy dropped to 37 years, interest rates ran at 70%, &amp; millions could no longer afford to eat.
According to the reactionaries’ own argument, capitalism must also be considered a bad economic idea since the logic also applies to Zimbabwe’s economic crisis..
So yeah..

So here is a thought. Currently, because of the PoW ice age, the block time is scheduled to start increasing in mid-2017, and past around 2019 the increase is going to grow exponentially. The mining reward does NOT increase proportionately. Hence, there is already an exponential slowdown in the growth of the ETH supply built into the protocol; my script shows:
Block 3000000, approx ETH supply 87962556, time '2017-01-16 00:38:33.067775' blocktime 14.86
Block 3500000, approx ETH supply 90612556, time '2017-04-11 18:09:34.273529' blocktime 15.27
Block 4000000, approx ETH supply 93262556, time '2017-08-15 18:20:24.642729' blocktime 30.01
Block 4500000, approx ETH supply 95912556, time '2018-11-03 05:55:48.912370' blocktime 136.71
Block 5000000, approx ETH supply 98562556, time '2025-10-02 11:47:30.658317' blocktime 835.81
Block 5500000, approx ETH supply 101212556, time '2128-03-20 09:14:16.483692' blocktime 17183.83
Block 6000000, approx ETH supply 103862556, time '5189-09-26 20:57:59.367004' blocktime 520901.19
Hence, in the foreseeable future, the supply will not go far above 100 million.
PoS is likely to lead to quite low issuance rates; I am not comfortable promising zero, but if it is not much less than the current PoW then there is little point in making the switch in any case. If the community wishes to, while PoW is in play, it's possible to agree that any delay to the ice age bomb should also respect this general ETH supply growth curve, so in a situation where at time X if current ethereum would have a 75s block time, the ice age patch would set the block time to 15s and the block reward to 1 ETH (and adjust uncle/nephew rewards proportionately).
That said, issuance is a key economic parameter and I personally don't feel I or the foundation or client developers have the authority to dictate this; perhaps it's worth some kind of vote.

The problem with capitalism is that its unfair since not everyone starts equally, this creates a great amount of inequality and the consetrantion of wealth in the hands of the few. Capitalism worked well to improve technology and human standards at the expense of other nations, but we have reached the point where we have to evolve to a better economic system or face our own demise.

It can even compete with Ethereum. Bitcoin is that old racist grandpa who you secretly wish would just die and leave you his money.

Emission wont be unlimited. Why do people here keep spreading misinformation? POS will be implemented. The Ice Age is already happening. Why not do some research before? Come join us.

Yea I rather put my trust in smart developers than on chinesse miners and shady businessman
