THANK YOU! What would be the best way to go about this? should i buy from coinbase with a CC and then keep some BTC in coinbase (eventually to ledger) and then send what i want to trade over to GDAX? or should i deposit some USD to GDAX directly and then buy BTC from there? Thx!

Really? You cannot sell BTC in CAD on coinbase? Ok, well do you know of any other sites I could transfer to if I were to sell, Thx! :)

Does this work if your CAD? If not any thing to do about it/alternatives? Also does Bittrex work if your CAD? Thx:)

did it say on coinbase that it couldnt verify you and ask you try again? also did you try it every time on your phone or laptop?

did u use your laptop webcam to take the photos?

I made sure mine was as clear as can be, anything you did special? How much space did you leave between your Id and the corners of the photo box, also did you use flash?

edit: 18:00 he explains his position on crypto
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:21:34
 this is his third time buying a Lambo from that store I think it's legit.

They explain in the video that leasing it is actually smarter because of taxes, plus I thought what he said about crypto was interesting, the whole new age internet part 
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:39:02
Exactly

I feel no ways for the people that got dumped on. Buying a coin that guarantees 25K% returns in a little over a year? No trade is guaranteed, no matter the claims, especially in this market. Lesson learned to them.

Look back in history, every currency that has ever existed has gone to zero. Then new ones come in. Do what you want with that information but all I'm saying is btc is new and the usd is "old"
