Trust me. Buy now or be left in the dust. This has happened this way many times before and it always goes up faster than others think. 30k by April.

It just means that the price has changed since then and it won’t fill anymore if your order because it is no longer at that price. If you cancel your order you will not lose anything. You will only have 1% of the order in USD and the rest will remain in ETH. I suggest you cancel the order, and instead of using limit orders, use market orders if you want them to fill immediately.

All in all just email, email, and email again.

That’s true only if they bought contracts at the high (which is pretty much the only chance they were able to buy so far). They could have also realized this cyclical pattern and they could’ve shorted the futures as well.

Yes i did, it took me 1 whole month. They told me to do a wire transfer but I couldn’t get to my bank to do one, so I just told Gemini that, and they unfroze my account in the condition that next time I bounce a deposit, I will have to do a wire transfer.

OTC doesn’t effect spot market at all. That’s why they do it OTC

Yes I agree. The South Korean crackdown was very unexpected and drove it down further than I initially thought. We should be back on track now though.

About how long would you say it takes them to respond to support emails? I know that they have probably been under a heavy load lately.

I believe that my bank did not recognize the address so they blocked the transaction.
