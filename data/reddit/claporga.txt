Holy crap, dude. Keep digging.

Solid article. Will share with others. Thank you for this.

There are exchanges all over Japan as well.

Think about why you are getting downvotes. The whitepaper may be “outdated” but this was the outline of this new technology. You think version 1.0 of anything is the final version? This is a piece of history. The Genesis. A reminder. Also a great piece to hang on the wall and a great way to spark a conversation at the house.

Looking to see this same story posted later on today. More news at 11.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:51:06
It’s historic. Thank you, whitepaper.

My wife said she just ordered mine for my birthday coming up. Beautiful piece! Absolutely excited to have it up in my office.

And I can't wait to check it out next week. Yokohama!

BOOM 18k!!! Seconds later 18.1.

Was in Japan last week. Shibuya near the crossing had a ton of stores and restaurants accepting BTC. Was pretty cool. 
Edit: spelling

This was a good read. Don't see any "FUD" here. Thanks for the post.

I really don’t understand this post. I’m also unsure about how real of a story this is. The police should help you regardless of what form of ransom the supposed abductors are asking for. It’s a crime that was committed.

It did, but we are on our way again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:00
I will never not upvote this repost. Moves me in ways I can’t describe when I read this. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:48:02
Definitely saved to my pasta database.

Might be one of the most famous bitcoin stories.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:36:38
Ummmm...high transaction fees and volatility at the moment. I am shocked why anyone would spend in BTC at the moment. Until things are sorted out with the network, I'm totally fine with bitcoin being a store of value and then transition into widespread currency use. Loss of Steam's involvement is a mere drop in the bucket.

Jesus, OP is getting reamed lol.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:01:37
You got mocked? Why are you linking your own self post? This is a really strange post. Also after selling, why are you still posting around here. Lingering might mean you have second thoughts about having the "I'm out." mindset.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:53:01
All according to keikaku.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:59
Jesus H. Christ lol.

FUD is weeding out and the strong HODL remains.

Same here! That second face gets me always. These are great memes. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 00:15:48
Yep, I even seen them on my first visit to Shibuya in summer 2017. Also saw them all over in Osaka spring 2018.

No CS degree (yet). But acquiring at least a secret DoD clearance and a baseline cert of at least a Sec+ can get you a cool $65k+ per year job. Just have a decent record and no crazy debt in collections and you are Gucci. Here in Hawaii, it is insanely easy to land a federal IT job.

This infographic shows innovations that were truly the first of its kind. Everyone is giving examples of variations/changes to already existing ideas and saying that many of these things have been proven a failure; Thus, trying to discredit this infographic. Variations of things already existing can fail. But when a truly new idea comes along like the blockchain, it is hard to compare it to anything else previous because, well, it didn't exist.

These were up all over Tokyo back in early December when we visited. I’m currently now visiting Osaka and there are shops everywhere accepting BTC and only BTC as the crypto of choice. I’d imagine this has been going on for quite some time now.

You are correct. A majority of Japan have only heard of it, but most have not grasped the concept. Still far ahead than the rest of the world!
