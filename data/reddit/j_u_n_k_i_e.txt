You're definitely right, I'm still invested but yeah, seeing as how bitcoin was the very first major crypto, I don't see how something couldn't be made eventually that's better and therefore takes most of the market
Appreciate the viewpoint

Certainly not! It's more just the [modern day double dutch rudder]( You mentally jerk someone else off with your HODL memes, and they do the same for you... but it's not gay since your using your OWN pc's!!!������������

The way it has hijacked your emotions and affected major, important components of your life is a clear cut case of addiction if I've ever seen any. As you can guess from my username, I know all about addiction. And if you switched the word "bitcoin" with "[whichever hard] drug" in your post, it'd be indistinguishable
Because of that, it's VERY rare for someone to get addicted to something and he able to go back into it more lighthearredly/not letting it control their lives so much.we are talking a needle in a fucking hay stack- and practically everyone thinks they can be this one in a million capable of it AND EVERY SINGLE addict WANTS to be.
Don't fool yourself man. I hope that you're able to step away, for good and salvage all your major life components like your girlfriend.  If you "try again and see if you can handle it".. and in trying to do so it's really bothering you throughout the day, romanticism about "hitting it big" and stressed about it going low - you NEED to realize this is a clear cut sign that it won't be any different this time. Trust me, we all want it to be different "this time"... it's never worked out for me or a single person I've EVER in my whole life met who was really addicted like this though...
Wish you the best comrade &lt;3

Damn, wish I had that kind of loot

Just recognizing an addiction (which this 100% is) as a problem is just the tip of the iceberg though.  It's sooooooooo hard to step away from something that you've felt so in love with in the past, and usually takes a lot of putting yourself through it, over and over, hoping it'll be different this time or that "I'll control it better **this** time!"
I really hope I'm wrong and OP can see this for what it is and know that it's time to step away- for good -  in order to avoid the misery and life consequences (losing girlfriend;  etc.) That will come if crypto price continues nailed to his mind...

Since almost all my subreddits I'm subscribed to are drug subs, I thought for sure this was going to be about cleaning needles lol

Are we done with these fucking baseless predictions yet? I'd really like to stay subscribed to this subreddit, but fuck me

Wow, well that's shit
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:03:35
I think it's a really good idea **IF** enough people latch onto it and actually use it but wtf on the sub names
You have the whole English language at your disposal.... and you bring us back "katchaka" and "cryptax"
OK fine isn't **too** terrible

I love bitcoin because it is the past,  present and future. Bitcoin is god, the devil. tbe holy spirit and the unholy crash. It is everything great in the world as well as everything evil. Because fuck bitcoin cash, and because Satoshi deserves blownjobs from us all (simultaneously)
What am I trying to say among all this nonsense? That you better support bitcoin and give Satoshi the blowjob he ~~wants~~ **deserves**, or else I'll do like Mike Tyson and make you my (hard of hearing) girlfriend.

Money-wise and logically,  I'd agree that it's gambling. But I believe in what it stands for soooooo much, theres never been something to invest in that I've ever given half a shit about before BTC. 
Notably I've been a broke drug addict for my whole adult/teenage life (now clean):and am not a consumer AT ALL/dont give a fucm about literally any material things.. so investing what i have that i don't need for rent/food etc while being clean, even if I were to "lose" it all, wouldn't really fuck me up. I'd be more upset that the idea failed then My loot.

Are people really able to semi-predict it with stuff like this? Anyone who can is a smart motherfucker and has my respect. I'm sure some of you are reading this.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:04:02


Um... no? As long as you keep your seed and don't get a usb drive with your electrum already logged into your wallet stolen then your shit will not just up and dissappear 100% of the time. If Robin hood goes down you're just fucked. Not that anything like that has EVER happened in the history of crypto....

So you're saying you shouldn't mail a bag of 5 bullets, with the names of the top 5 IRS people on a note attached to each one? And I just wanted to make sure the right people got my payment!
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:47:50
How's that (having LTC) stupid?  LTC skyrocketed right with BTC.... I remember I thought I got fucked when I bought at like $40 and then it went up to like $250..... wish I never sold that shit.

From the article, don't bother clicking. 
1) do your research
2) buy the dip
3)keep your coins in a wallet (lol this shows you how trash this article is right here, not that this list wasn't enough)
5)don't invest more then willing to lose
Fuck your clicks and the shit tier trash within
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:49:21
No.... I hold but I still want my fucking coin in my own wallet.
That's like... well I can't think of a good comparision, so it's a lot like ��**shit**��
