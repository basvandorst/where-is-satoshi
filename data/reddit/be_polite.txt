Yes I can do SWIFT wire transfers. I tried using such sites even cex.io. The thing is your document's just end up in verification. and they never respond to you. The ones who do just say they can't verify your account.

Can you mine on your pi 4 too? I'm not sure if you're trying to counter the point that "Bitcoin requires some basics of society to function."

I think the real problem here may be with the process of actually investigating what OP is claiming. And the cost of that investigation may be worth more than 1 BTC to Huobi. Also, If Huobi refunds him, It will mean that they will reveal their cold wallet address and that opens up a lot of other concerns. I understand the point of view of OP but depending on the organisation, and how things are set up, It may not be a very easy process for them to refund him.

One problem with their cold address being known is that any activity from that address will be traced and monitored by their competitors.  Also, they may be a process of accessing the cold wallet on their part and that process may be quite costly in terms of resources.
Anyways smaybe I'm over thinking. Maybe those guys are just a dick and they don't want to  refund that guy his money.
