What are you talking about?

Did you just ignore the comment I was replying to? In other words, the guy was saying the time to confirm the payment is irrelevant since downloading the game isn't instant anyway. I was merely pointing out that in my case, on average, it actually takes longer to confirm the payment than downloading the game itself (not all of them of course).


I have been into Bitcoin since 2011, I have built numerous websites and apps, I run a few websites related to Bitcoin, I have contributed to it more than you can imagine.

I can download most of the games faster than 1 Bitcoin network confirmation. Even if several GB (up to 7.5GB in my case at the moment, and much more in a few years).

Why are you telling me this? I'm talking about this specific company, I was probably their first costumer payment for the large plan with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-25 14:03:10
First you say you don't get it then you explain exactly why the company doesn't accept BTC directly.
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:21:59
Because the seller didn't want to.

I can't handle the cringe.

wew lad! omfg amazin! it's moon time baby!


You fucking retard why did you use Payza? It sucks so much, just pay directly and tell the seller to HOLD herp derp.
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:24:56
Probably because it's not frequent that costumers want to pay in Bitcoin.
