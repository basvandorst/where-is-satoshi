If your 2FA secret is leaked then, yes, your "new keys" are known too. They're based 100% on your secret + (\*N\*X) time. If you happened to set up 2FA in that period and your secret is cached/exposed/leaked then you're vulnerable. Read [the RFC]( if you don't believe me.

Depends on what "yesterday" means. If it was during "the CloudBleed period" they *could* not be.

Yes please! OMG most beautiful car in the world... But my Model S will have to do for now ;-)

I think i raised them okay enough to be frugal with their money. But hey, at least they'll HAVE something to blow ...hopefully ;-)

Because between then and now nothing will change? They won't sell (maybe all of it, maybe next month)? They won't buy more? If anything this post documents the start of something beautiful but it won't be any more than that.
Nobody will be able to tell how much their BTC is worth or how much BTC they have by then since I won't keep posting updates on all of their transactions (be it buying or selling). And let's be honest; the amounts posted are peanuts. If they're going to be millionaires from this "much" then there will be millions of millionaires more and they will just blend in the crowd.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:29:30
No ofcourse not ;-) They handed me some bills from their piggy bank, I bought the BTC and put 'em in a wallet for them. Come to think of it... should've charged a 'fee' for my efforts ��
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:41:53


Nope. They both spent (about) 1/3 or 1/4 of their savings. And since they currently aren't saving up for anything and had no real goal for the money I'm fine with that. Hell, even 1/2 would've been okay but they decided on the amount theirselves and who am I to talk them into spending more/less of their own hard-earned money? As a dad I will make sure they don't go overboard but also as a dad I am damn straight proud of 'em handling it the way they do.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:23:40
Don't you worry. I know how to parent my kids and have been teaching them all their lives that money comes from hard work. They both know this is closer to gambling than anything else. That's why they only "invested" what they could miss.

How is this spam? Did I offer anything? Did I post any links to any services/products? What makes this spam? It's just a happy message. Lighten up.


Did you read the comments? Apparently some people do.


If that annoys you enough or even more than you're currently annoyed by an innocent post then, why yes, I might consider it. Just to annoy _you_.

Started out as a 60D but is now a 75D. Upgraded a few months ago. But you're correct, 60's (and 40's) are no longer made; "lowest" is now 75D. Only other choice is (P)100D. Mine is now just over a year old.

TBH I don't know. Oldest came to me, said he wanted me to consider let him buy BTC. We had a chit-chat about it, he seemed to know what he was talking about (basics). I talked about what I knew, googled a thing or two and then we decided to buy. Had to figure out where to buy best and after some verifications and stuff we ordered his bitcoins and waited for the transfer to be completed / verified. Took some time since seller needed more verification(s) but after a call all was well and we saw the balance increased. Yay!
So, what sources? I honestly don't know but I can say for pretty sure that most likely he got the idea from a YouTuber or something from a YouTube video etc. I guess he did some research and figured out what he needed to and then came to me for more and/or help.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:41:19
Not at all. 
[Here's oldest kid's]( when he was at profit earlier this evening (and still is). Here is [youngest kid's]( when he was at loss earlier this evening (in profit by now).
It shows in the left column the current exchange rate for 1 BTC -&gt; EUR and vice versa, the timestamp of the page refresh (all the way on the bottom there's a refresh timer that counts down (30 seconds currently) before each refresh), the timstamp of when the data was retrieved (also cached for some time) and the source of where the exchangerate data came from.
The middle column shows information about their 'investment'. Top to bottom: $ loss/win (red/green), current worth of their 'investment' in €, the amount of BTC they have, the amount spent from the piggybank, the win/loss margin.
The right column contains links to several charts.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:22:16


Yeah, I just did (someone mentioned breaking 7K in the thread). Two very happy kids! Both up around €15.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:34:06
They both decided, up-front, before we even bought, that they'd be in it for a long (year(s)+) time. So, yes, they were very happy to see today's increase, but, no, they're not selling.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:27:38
The price difference (60D vs 75D) at purchase was around $10K. I upgraded for $2100 since the price went down all year. It's well worth the $2100 but, in hindsight, maybe would've also gone for it af $10K. Glad I didn't though. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:48:47
Yeah, been wondering that myself too lately. Dad should talk to mom...

@_date: 2018-07-17 18:31:13
The "millionaire" was tongue-in-cheek. They know damn well about the risks (losing it all possibly) and that they'll be in it for the long haul and then *still* have to hope it's worth the wait. Might get lucky and see dec. 2017 prices. Might have bad luck and see it crash and burn (eventually). They know they're (sort of) "gambling". And they do it with money from their piggy bank that they consciously decided they can miss. And they have realistic expectations.
But if they want to dream to be a millionaire, let 'em. Why not? Don't you dream about it? I know I do. You just need to make sure your expectations are realistic. In dreams you can let go of your expectations.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:32:39


Uh, yeah, I'm hoping they'll learn that too. They both know they should be in it for the long haul (and they both are), but currently it's (ofcourse) cool to see what their investment does. Up 2 cents, down 8 cents, up 11 cents, ...! They're in a rollercoaster. Eventually they'll learn to "let it go" and check (for example) once a day before bedtime or once a week or something similar...
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:29:47
Losing on ETH will be a valuable lesson too ;-)
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:35:44


Keep in mind they're very young but, daddy being a "coder", they've seen their fair share of code already in their lives. I'm pretty sure "crypto-code" will soon be on the programme too.
Not too long ago I saw a video (series?) on YouTube which explained it (with code) step-by-step in a pretty simple form. I'll have to dig it up but I plan on showing them those videos.
Edit: I think I [found it](
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:24:59
They have to go thru me for everything ��
Also; they're well aware that colorful or shiny is not always best so I'm not that afraid of that happening. In fact, oldest does his research thoroughly (for his age). Youngest usually follows that and saves himself the research ��
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:27:57
Fingers crossed! �� ^(though I hope by then it's a Tesla... ��)

...I was kidding ��
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:12:51
When he gets older (old enough to understand the concept of money etc) you should see his face when he gets into it and learns to read the exchange rate graphs etc. So cool to see. And good for you switching to BTC! Should've probably done that about 11 years ago too... oh, wait... ��
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:29:16
Yeah, I'm an adult. I know the risks involved. I'll take my chances on this one.

The oldest one actually is pretty interested in the tech; but he's always been that way. I had to keep it WAAAAY ELI5 but they both know the basics of stuff like about hashes, mining, supply/demand etc. but oldest keeps digging deeper and keeps coming up with (meaningful) questions. Youngest one is interested but a bit more interested in the.. uh.. interest ��
