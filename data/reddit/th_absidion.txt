No. I know the words. I'm just... I smoke a lot of weed ok. Makes it hard to think when you're Spacey. So that fault is on me. But, then again I wasn't really good academically. My sister got all the brain while I got all the brawn. I look to her to help me understand big words sometimes. But, she's moving to another state soon. So I gotta learn to do some of these things on my own. So I'm taking it slowly. But, this Bitcoin thing really confuses me.

No. I just can't find the proper site to explain it to me better. I've been tryna do this for a year now but I just don't get it. I finally said fuck it and made a post here hoping someone can explain it better. Trust me I've tried. I just don't get it.

Wow. Ok. That's a lot to take in and helps me understand why prices go up when minimum wage goes up. Thank you for this.

Thank you. I appreciate the links and summary you did. Very appreciative.

Thank you. I appreciate this. I'll probably check out Bitcoin when I'm in a better situation then.

Bitcoin. Tryna understand it better. I'm not good with words.

I'm trying all the routes possible to get out of my financial hole. That's why I wanna know if Bitcoin can help with that.

Yes. Because me wanting the post to be quick and less detailed makes me look lazy. I'm sorry, but you don't know me at all. When I use "blah blah blah" it's for me. Not you guys. It's to remind me the post needs to be short and sweet. Not a 5 paragraph detail like I usually do. My bad for wanting quick answers. Also, it does make you an ass cause you assumed I made no effort of research before this post, when I've tried to research this for over a year and just got more and more confused. Next time remember this.
Assume: you make an ASS out of U and ME.

That's why I'm asking? Not sorry that I'm not good with big words, but if you wanna be an ass instead of helping someone understand better that's on you. Lmao.

Yeah. That's what I keep reading about. But IDK if it's like a stock thing or a bank thing. I remember seeing a video saying this guy gave away 2 bitcoins for some pizza. The dude went on to talk about how the guy wasted thousands of dollars on $40 worth of pizza. I guess that's what got me interested to know what exactly Bitcoin is and how it works. How does one get a Bitcoin? Is it from your pocket or like I said from stocks?
