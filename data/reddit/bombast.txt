This is what we are talking about-- the LAWS are different for the super rich! Its not that they are doing things **currently** illegal (sometimes they are), its that they have rigged the political/judicial system to say that the super rich money crimes are no longer illegal. Tax dodging is AMORAL, but its only ILLEGAL when people of normal economic standing do it. Current laws =/= morality. This is why laws change, to fix and create loopholes to make immorality (il)legal.
When the super rich run the political system and governance, they get to say that their crimes are fine, but the crimes of others are not. Even aside from policy involving money-- the crack-cocaine vs. cocaine legal differentiation of the 80s was proof of that.

FTFY. First step is doing it. Who cares if its "good". Keep doing it *because* you love it and you will get "better", whatever your subjective definition of such is.

Glad I could help inspire you. I pushed you, now push yourself the rest of the way.

For real though, same applies to making music or any other subjective art. Art is art, there's no rules. Do it because your passion says you must do it; not because there is a framework of rules you seek to understand and follow. The best artists are the ones who give a fuck, but don't give a fuck. They are passionate about their art, but don't give a fuck what others think. More often than not, that mentality paradoxically means others will think highly of it.

As a Chicagoan, can you PM me some more details please? Thanks!

If Reddit represents 1/4th of any international community that is scary. Also, to say that lurkers who are introverts and shy don't count as people who could try this experience is flat out the wrong way to go about thinking.

Ah true, fair enough. I retract my statement in that regard.

Hilarious that there was a 1/7.5billion chance that his pointless retort wouldn't be thwarted. He took that gamble and lost.

Yeah great point, I was thinking that too. Probably a bit more than a million though, right?

Its volatile BECAUSE its not the norm currency. Fiat is necessary for everyday life so it stays tight.

Quick, post podcasts before Jordan Peterson's Lobster Boys CENSOR us! The Chapo-llectual Dark Web will not be silenced!

I guess when they say "trickle-down economics", the thing trickling down is the burden and consequences.

The US is ran by Baby Boomers.... -still-. They've had power for decades and have put measures in place to extend that as long as possible.

Yep... they didn't give a fuck while they were young/middle age. Now that they are OLD... they give even LESS of a fuck.
Millenials have been fed greedy/vapid pop-culture and reality TV by baby boomers, yet somehow we are surviving with morals in-tact. I pray that by the time Millenials get power that those morals haven't been destroyed by pessimism. The sooner the millenials get a say in things, the more optimistic the future will be.
I just hope we get the good aspects of millenials in the forefront and not the bad things like supporting censorship :|

And then a public that calls you a "sore loser" when you point it out.

Its not just that, it was during Bernie's primary as well.
The secret truth the sensationalist media doesn't want you to know is that *actual leftists* hate the Democrat establishment every bit as might as right wingers do. Instead the media would rather just pit you against everyone besides yourself.
The first-past-the-post system makes it near impossible to fix our system. Lets say primaries weren't rigged... if two Berniecrats run against a corporate Democrat, they will be forced to split the vote despite having the same ideology and purpose. Its like we have to form parties within our parties since FPTP mathematically defaults to a 2-party system.
