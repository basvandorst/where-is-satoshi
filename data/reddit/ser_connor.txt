Well we’ve done it before and worked perfectly. My concern is that we did it during the coinbase adopting BCH and the system was all messed up, and worried they mixed up my address.

I’m involved because I own the coinbase account that we’ve both put money into. We’re both solid with technology just use my account because just better to have it all together. I got my coinbase wallet address and copied it and sent it to him and he copied and pasted it and then never got the bitcoin

Well I was using the app and copied the address automatically and I know we would have copied and pasted it too since it’s so long. So it’s just weird

I mean it’s not my money, he just wanted to send his money into bitcoin.

Even from the app on my Iphone?

Anyone able to help? I have my brother my coinbase wallet address and he gave it to Bovada to deposit his winnings into bitcoin, he sent the money and it was confirmed from Bovada but I never received it in my wallet it’s been a full week. Called Bovada but they said it was sent to a different address and nothing they can do about it. Any suggestions?

Also wondering this, At what point should I move them? Why not just leave them on coinbase.

So it’s pretty much like having my money in the bank. Having coinbase hold my BTC. I plan on spending a set amount every 2 weeks when I get paid. At what amount do you recommend moving it off coinbase?
