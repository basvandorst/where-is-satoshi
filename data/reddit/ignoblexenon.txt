Average price/cost absolutely does have meaning, but if you want my last big transactions, I sold a small percentage of my stake at $1,050, re-bought the same number of coins at $495 on the way down, and re-bought twice as many coins at $240. So, still, no bags being held.

My average purchase-price/cost-to-mine is ~$10/btc. The only bag I'm holding is not having sold more than I did at ~$1,000/btc.

First off, people shouldn't be downvoting you...
It's called taking a controlled rake of profits as opposed to gambling in an extremely volatile market with unbalanced downside/upside risk/potential. I have been dollar cost averaging out of my early relatively free stake. My first sell at ~$50/btc secured a profit of 10x my initial cost. I then sold the same dollar amount out at ~$100/btc, ~$250/btc, ~$500/btc, and ~$1,000/btc. On the way down, I rebought the btc previously sold with half of the most recent sale's profit. Timing is the only reason I haven't sold over the $500/btc rake-point again yet.
This is a conservative investment strategy with sight of the potential extreme upside while having already secured massive profits to protect against any downside.
