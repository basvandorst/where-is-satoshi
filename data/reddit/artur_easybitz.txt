We have developed map at  together with our bitcoin payment processor which is POS and 0-click system.  
Merchants are sorted by the latest transaction date which should be enough to be sure that merchant is accepting BTC.
On a consumer side we are sending weekly newsletter of new merchants signed up in their area. Moreover we are rewarding with socialpoints every time user signs up a merchant or refers a friend.
We are releasing worldwide map in a few days and will have bigger announcement. Ofcourse we are going to have API for other bitcoin payment processors that they could propagate their merchants transactions so they would appear on our map.

This is what we are trying to solve. To show to merchants that bitcoin is real. That means we need to drive bitcoin people to the merchant and spend their coins there. Believe me, bitcoins do want to spend not only online, but on the streets as well, because we want to make it transactional currency, right?  
The only problem now is that merchants who are accepting bitcoin are not visible to bitcoin people. Sadly coinmap.org is not very user friendly and you are not sure about whether merchant is accept bitcoin anymore.
That's why we have built POS solution and 0-click system for merchant and on a consumer side we have a map with merchants and to keep the hype up an email/SMS notifications are sent out about new merchants accepting bitcoin in his area.

No, this is developed by me at easybitz.com and you can use it too and you are still in control of your private keys if you use that API, because you install the bitcoind and our API on your local machine. You can find the installation guide for all the parts in the readme here

Things are moving fast. Do you remember how many useful apps were in bitcoin ecosystem a year ago? You will be amazed how quickly your stated problem will be solved.

We actually have done it at  and call it **0-click payment**  
It's even easier than TxtPay. Merchant has to print out his public address and whenever somebody sends there coins, we send to merchant SMS of the fiat amount he received on that bitcoin address.

Coinmap is great but not all listed businesses who are listed there are accepting bitcoins, sadly.
Therefore we have developed at  a living map with merchants that are accepting bitcoins. Moreover the merchants are sorted in order when the last transaction happened at them. The map is still in beta but the solution for merchants with POS and 0-click system are already live and are used by brick &amp; mortar businesses in NYC.  
Sorry for promoting similar service in that thread.

At  we have already a working map with merchants who are accepting bitcoin. Right now we have only NYC merchants showing but in a few days we are going to release worldwide map with major announcement. In meantime you can sign up merchants in your area and get bitpoints on our platform for that.

Here's how we sign up merchants: don't tell about bitcoin, just say 0% fees, no chargebacks and 100% dollars in your bank account next business day. Let them take time, as they see that currency is real and people pay with that, they will get their interest to it.  
When you meet a girl in a nightclub, you wouldn't talk right away about your grandmother, what your parents eat for breakfast. Same with bitcoin, once you mention bitcoin, you suck merchant down into rabbithole and can start discussing history of money.
Here we did a good blog post about it, how to make merchant accept bitcoin

I dont want to start arguing but real life shows that people are using bitcoin to purchase stuff whether online or on the streets

Please add these too  
 - bitcoin payment processor and POS for retail/brick &amp; mortar
 - bitcoin accepting merchants living map.

At  we have live map of merchants accepting bitcoin. Because we provide them merchant tools, we know when they have last time accepted bitcoin and last transaction time on the map. That means there is much less chance that they don't accept anymore bitcoin like it may happen with coinmap merchants
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:43:58
I have been adding our merchants to coinmap all the time. But everytime it's a big hassle, process is not easy nor convinient, requires multiple steps, making correct tags and is not tailored to bitcoin merchants but is just openstreetmap overall data entry.  
I'm sure some non tech savvy guy won't handle that and in the middle of the process will just close it

Signing up merchants is simple. But as you have heard that merchants receive bitcoin sales once a month or even less so it's probably no picture at all rather than any picture of bitcoin people :)
That's why we are approaching at very different angles on how to bring bitcoin sales to the merchants and show them that bitcoin is real and is being used. This angle is organizing a flashmob at our signed up merchant and on chosen evening going with a crowd to the merchant and making bitcoins rain :)
Everybody is welcome to join our meetup in New York City and you will find when is our next flashbom.

This is true that customer needs to have smartphone with internet connection to initiate a transaction.  
Merchant on the other hand doesn't require smartphone/tablet nor internet connection to accept payment. Only the bitcoin address QR code is needed and easybitz processes the payment and will let know merchant that payment was received by SMS/email.
Internesting to see which kind of internet-free bitcoin payments will be developed in the future

working on it at easybitz.com and currently majorly redesigning and adding tons of new features that are possible only to bitcoin  
we already have referral system for signed up users and for each spending at that merchant user gets back some %. We have already a map of merchants that accept BTC and they can post discounts there as well.

dont worry its all good. this bitcoin address is under andrews  (former easybitz) merchant account. he is using it to receive donations and later on as he told us, he transfers out to his personal wallet.
