If I were you, I would immediately cut out the family members who are especially aggressive.
Also, I would stop telling people you own bitcoin. Don’t do that guessing game bullshit too by saying “not enough”. If someone asks, just tell them you don’t have any and that you sold “a while ago”.
I don’t know the type of people you’re around but the way you described them, they sound like a bunch of degenerates. 
I would also consider moving to a better area.

You have to understand that the exchanges have had unprecedented growth.

Andreas Antonopoulos makes it easy to understand...he does paint a nice pretty picture but overall spells out the ideas and complexities for every day people to understand.
I like Trace Mayer as well. I’d say he’s another important thought leader within the space and listening to his earlier interviews that go way far back...he’s always had a very clear direction and understanding.

The valuation is volatile because it is being priced on the world stage and it is insanely small compared to actual money related assets globally.
A huge fallacy with volatility is relating it to a local ecosystem (ie stocks)...bitcoin is fucking global and the barrier to entry is a lot lower than any of the other assets.

Although I get what you’re saying, there’s no way to regulate a price from being “overvalued” in a free market, without some major restrictions.
Corrections are “good” because it shows where the support level is after the combination of profit takers and dumbasses sell off.
There are a lot of idiots buying into crypto right now because of the “get rich quick” mentality...these guys will eventually fuel this bubble and will also be the first ones to sell during a “correction”.

I have no idea why you’re bringing fractional reserve banking into this, unless you meant the exchanges?
Bitcoin, like anything, has value because the market assigns it value.
No one dumped 150 billion into bitcoin or 23 billion into bitcoin cash.
The individual tokens traded on the open market fetch x amount of dollars. When you multiply that with supply, you arrive at the market cap.
This is how companies are valuations are arrived upon.

I’m one of those people who think it’ll replace fiat.
Sort of.
I think it’ll replace the underlying value to assets globally. It won’t happen next year but slowly it will. The only thing that could stop this from happening is a systematic failure (bitcoins code fails).
The scaling will and is happening.
Everyone has a price to “cash out”. Nothing wrong with that. That is what makes markets fluid.

I don’t think you can look at this in a black and white scenario.
For satoshis stash, I don’t think you can just assume it’s lost...best scenario would be to put it in a grey area, it’s neither lost nor found. It should be it’s own special case.
For all other cases, I think addresses who haven’t shown movement from an early date are at a much higher likelihood of being lost than say an addresss created in 2016.
This is because of the value of bitcoin. When bitcoin was worth negligible amounts of money people likely did not take proper measures in storing it.

Both of your calculations are assuming bitcoin will replace money....it’s a lot more valuable than that

Assuming a massive correction, the “damaged” reputation will be more media hype than anything.
I’ve considered the same scenario as well. As long as the technical fundamentals are in-tact, it doesn’t matter.
Larger question is: a huge sell off would obviously be from dumb money....so who’s buying?

What the fuck are you rambling about.
You’re comparing apples to fucking horse shit. 
The market is trying to find fair value for bitcoin, a commodity/currency who is in its infancy.
Also failed to mention that each bitcoin is divisible by 100 million.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:59:16
Bitcoins intrinsic value is that it is becoming a global decentralized trustless payment network that can transact and secure value.
This is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:54:01
because of the current state of things, bitcoin by default is a store of value.
Is it money? Sort of. But it won’t be practical money till it’s valuation is in the hundreds of trillions.
You seem to underestimate the idea of store of value. If you were someone who had tens / hundreds of millions and wanted to store that value somewhere without the possibility of losing value to attrition from inflation rates....your options are slim.
Do you have any idea how to sell 100 million in gold??
You need a middle man to find a market for you and they will take a good commission. This is true with anything. Real estate, diamonds (which is insanely volatile and useless), fine art (insane commissions).
Bitcoin doesn’t need this. You put in 100 million and you get roughly 100 million back (once the price is stable).
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:15:34
That’s the problem.
You’re just looking at currency.

This calculation and a lot of other ones, disregard bitcoins actual market.
Bitcoin behaves like money but also a store of value. There are a lot of money related assets out there (stocks, bonds, treasuries etc)...these things are priced out in fiat and if bitcoin ever becomes a global store of value, it’ll soak up this value as well.

I get what wealth is vs value, I used the terms interchangeably due to being casual.
I got into bitcoin in feb 2017. This was right before the hype train. “Back” then, there was hardly any reliable news on it and I did a lot of research. I didn’t know a single person that owned bitcoin and people thought I was nuts for buying in.
Myself and others share your fears of the money mongering that’s going on. However, I think you’re missing the bigger picture and getting distracted by the “hysteria”.
If you think this is crazy, wait till next year. 
I think you’re misunderstanding bitcoins usecase. Due to its mechanics in its current state, it’s terrible for every day transactions but better than anything we have ever seen when accounting for large exchanges of value. It’s the most insanely liquid asset we have ever seen, ever.
You’re reading too much into the tea leaves and driving yourself nuts.
You know all of these idiots that say shit like “I should have bought Apple or amazon when it was a nickle, I would be a millionaire now”.
The one thing they never understand is that they would’ve had to have bought and hold throughout the years.
This is that time and you’re busy mindfucking yourself.

So someone “accidentally” sent you bitcoins to your newly generated address (implausible) and you found the sender within hours of its receipt on reddit AND returned it????

Edit: lamphater has a year old account with ZERO fucking activity, no address to show transaction and the odds of finding someone in this manner are fucking insanely slim.

You seem like a smart guy who works in finance but you’re connecting dots that shouldn’t be connected and also are not getting the idea of value.
The market IS assigning value to Apple by trading, it is actively figuring this out. The price swings up and down because there is CONSTANT speculation of the market value. IE - Apple announces tomorrow that it had 500 trillion in q4 earnings...well guess what, the market will go apeshit as it reassigns a more correct value to reflect this.
Your second fallacy, much like a lot of people within the space, is to compare bitcoins movement to that of a stock. This is not a stock.
It is not a company, so forget price earnings and all of that other nonsense.
Where did the wealth come from?
It came from people purchasing it on the open market, they are WILLING to pay said price for bitcoin. You can interpret it this however which way you please...but people are basically voting with their fiat to say that bitcoin is worth x amount.
Do you know what gives money its value? It’s from participation. You get a group of people who believe something has value and BOOM, it has value.
Gold is just a rare metal but because we collectively agree to this idea that it has value, then it has value. Same as money.
Same as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:43
They’re side bets being placed.
One guy is betting price will be lower, another guy is betting the price will be higher.

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:37:12
Best piece of advice I can give is to really understand the mechanics of the technology, so when the inevitable price dips happen you can cross reference your understanding and separate fact from bullshit.

@_date: 2019-03-15 18:32:47
It doesn’t settle on the bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin futures are all side bets, same as exchanges

Lol there you go. Did this really need to go on the bitcoin reddit?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:57:02
I get that this is an "impossible" feat but this does have a financial implication on the perceived value of bitcoin.
Again, there is no financial incentive or understanding to motivate anyone to properly research this (yet) but ill be more than willing to bet the house that if a single bitcoin gets a valuation into some serious numbers, this will become a very very important issue
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:51:35
I know. I provided the caveat that it isnt the same but
The market does psychologically value bitcoin/fiat at a certain rate, given the overall total "float"
I dont think anyone will care to do proper research till bitcoin gains some "serious" value into the 10s or 100s of thousands each.
Also, i agree with your assumption on satoshis stash having an effect on market prices
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:32:31
Again, i understand that cryptocurrency has ZERO in common with stocks.
I understand.
Lost coins are not priced in.
For example: if it were discovered that only 1m bitcoin existed, are we to say that the 3.85 billion "cap" bitcoin would have is a true valuation of bitcoin?
There is obvious market psychology involved in determining prices. 
As of now, the incentive to seriously research the total accessible bitcoin just isnt there, both from a public understanding and financial incentive standpoint.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:56:23
The quoted number of bitcoin is always the total ever mined.
I am 100% sure this is not priced in.
Bitcoin isnt worth enough to investigate this. I know, its a laughable comment but bigger picture....it isnt.
The majority of people do not understand bitcoin enough
Case in point: lets say hypothetically the true number of bitcoin in existence that is retrievable is 1 million.
Are we REALLY to say bitcoin is only worth 3.8 billion?? This would give us a cap below the top 5
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:24:27
You’re looking at it from a value of bitcoin to US dollars, I provided the caveat that IF bitcoin becomes the standard global instrument for money, then creating more satoshi is essentially inflation.
Your head is stuck on the 21 million hard cap versus fiat. You’re not considering if there was no such thing as fiat and it was ONLY bitcoin.

Like I said, the caveat is if bitcoin becomes the standard currency.
I provided a pretty clear example above with the purchase of a can of coke. You’re just not getting it because you want to insist that you’re right (when you’re not).
Not sure what else to say but you are stuck on looking at bitcoin vs fiat.
Like I said, dividing bitcoin today isn’t an issue. It will become an issue if there was no fiat and bitcoin was THE currency.
Then dividing it IS inflation, you know...basic math.

Nice argument on what speculation is and why it’s healthy.
People have been too quick to categorize bitcoin as being a “bubble” for far too long.
I think we will get tons of highs and lows of the charts till either bitcoin tanks, then the naysayers will have a field day or once the price reaches a very healthy valuation of 50,000-100,000+
Once this happens, it’ll send a psychological shockwave throughout the investment community from “fuck bitcoin” to “what the fuck is bitcoin?”

You have no idea how she will react to that windfall of money. 
Worst case scenario, she will think she won the lottery and tell friends and family. 
Your current life is of a person making 50,000 and you are married to someone making 25,000. 
Chances are very likely your social group is around your level.
Telling her flat out will completely change your life forever and can create A LOT of problems.
If you are to tell her, tell her of a MUCH smaller amount than the entire figure.
Large enough to reassure her but small enough where she doesn’t quit her job.
YOU need to manage this, you’ve done well so far so this is your burden. 
If she handles the windfal of money, maybe slowly over the years introduce more and more of it.

Same here but I also understand what inflation and deflation are.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:14:16
He’s right, it is inflationary if we chose to increase the number of satoshi.
Consider this:
If there are 21 bitcoin and each can be divided 100 times, that leaves us with 2100 satoshi.
If we increase the divisible number to 100,000, that will leave us with 2,100,000 satoshi.
Assuming 1 satoshi were able to buy a can of coke in the initial example, we would need 1,000 to buy it in the inflated example.
This isn’t a concern now but in the future, say if bitcoin was the standard of global value, then it would be an issue

So currently, it’s $9000 usd for 1 bitcoin.

If, however, we live in a world where bitcoin is THE form of money, then dividing bitcoin into a trillion parts IS inflation.

Lol, yes definitely. A lot of people here are in it for pure speculation, not going to deny that. They will be the first ones to sell when the price dips or will sell their bitcoin at a “profit” on the way up. No doubt.
I’m not worried about those people. 
For every 100 of them, there’s 1 person like me who will get a fucking hard-on every time the price dips 50% from a panic sell. I see way too much value and potential in this long term and I am always looking for evidence to contradict my beliefs.

Bitcoin has the larger user base. This is what gives money its “intrinsic” value.
The thing that’s giving ethereum it’s “value” from a fiat perspective are all the ether tied up on these projects running on ether.
If any of them ever prove to be the killer app, it’ll do wonders for ethereums price. So far, no projects have proven themselves.
This isn’t me discounting ethereum and the dapps, just that I don’t think any have panned out.
Because as soon as they do, that’s when you’ll see a clear separation of ethereum actually doing what it’s supposed to be doing.
People like you will stop comparing it to bitcoin as being a store of value and focus more on the smart contract value.
This isn’t derogatory but ethereum is not a store of value.

A bitcoin divided from 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000,000 is NOT the same thing, assuming if it is the standard currency.

@_date: 2017-11-25 21:37:33
I just read your article and comments.
I disagree with your opinion only because I see bitcoin as a value transfer of one system to another.
Crypto currency, to me, is an empty gas tank that is capturing the sloppy value of the fiat system and compartmentalizing it.
I think it’s easy and natural for anyone involved in the markets to make general assumptions, heck I had dinner with my hedge fund buddies and they still think bitcoin is a scam or in a bubble.
I asked them point blank, what their definition of money was, the majority of them stopped dead in their tracks and gave it some thought before retorting that “it’s back by government or assets”, which I thought was insane. These guys are Stanford, Harvard and Columbia mba’s too.
I get why people think it’s a bubble but I think we are in a divide of the haves and have nots, both insulated within their respective echo chambers.
My prediction is once we hit a price of around 50,000-100,000 this conversation of bubble bs will turn into “what could be”.

THIS EXAMPLE BELOW ASSUMES THAT BITCOIN IS GLOBAL MONEY AND THERE IS NO FIAT:
Consider this: If there are 21 bitcoin and each can be divided 100 times, that leaves us with 2100 satoshi.
If we increase the divisible number to 100,000, that will leave us with 2,100,000 satoshi.
Assuming 1 satoshi were able to buy a can of coke in the initial example, we would need 1,000 to buy it in the inflated example.

Did you fully read the thread and how this whole thing started?
You’re losing me with all this talk of rounding up and down and fractions of satoshi.
I feel as if we are having two completely different discussions here.
Please also read my caveat before assuming what I mean by inflation. 
In today’s current state, dividing a bitcoin further than 100,000,000 is NOT inflation.
However, in the future if bitcoin were THE
 currency (no fiat), then dividing a bitcoin by say 1 trillion, would be inflation.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:56:01
I wouldnt look at the price fluctuations, it will drive you nuts and it’s meaningless to the value security the network offers.
Also, theres no such thing as “insider trading” with bitcoin. It is not a corporation.
There are, however, a LOT of variables and actors at play. There may be little spurts of price manipulation but that is due to the low market cap, given the type of asset bitcoin is.
If you wanted to compare bitcoins market cap to that of a traditional stock, its current valuation is a penny stock.

If we increase the divisible number to 100,000, that will leave us with 2,100,000 satoshi.

I’m not contradicting shit, it’s because in your mind you’re relating “gains” to “ROI”.
Why does Apple stock increase in value? It’s because of sales, how much money they have on the books vs debt etc.
This is what drives the price of stocks.
People speculate on a companies earnings.
The thing a good number of people are not understanding with bitcoin gains is their misunderstanding of what money is.
Bitcoins value is increasing with its increasing user base. This is what gives money its value. USER BASE.
Sure there are tons of mouth breathing fuckheads in the space who give two fucks about the technology and just want their “profits”.

I think once adoption happens, we will come full circle and have a system in place that mirrors today’s system.
The main reason is because the average person does not have time to safeguard crypto and is typically uninformed.

One thing to consider in your calculation that it’s in a vacuum.

@_date: 2017-11-25 21:58:07
Lols you have no idea what you’re talking about.
Stocks are speculative because investors are speculating on ROI, return on investments.
Bitcoins value is NOT tied to returns, unless you’re an idiot, it’s tied to use case. This is what gives fiat it’s value, user base.
Please understand what crypto is and it’s potential, instead of misaligning and misinforming people with nonsense about it behaving like a stock.

Dr. Paul is very educated on fiscal policy. I found it a bit surprising that he endorsed bitcoin but he is a good guy and very smart. 
On that note, the reason I consider bitcoin to be a “safe” investment is the alarming interest rates we’ve had since 2009.
It never made any sense to me to have the interest rates pegged so low and when I came across bitcoin, I saw an immediate out.

Not full of shit, you’re too fucking dumb to understand what I’m talking about.
You’re stuck on comparing bitcoin vs fiat prices but are too fucking stupid to understand that this is a relative basis.
Bitcoin itself is functioning as it is intended to. 
This “fluctuation” in price we see is relative to fiat and doesn’t mean anything to what bitcoin is or does.
Of course, you’ll call me full of shit but are too fucking stupid to understand this.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:59:20
It’s the internet, I can call you a fuckhead all I want.
Back on point:
You’re correct in use case vs public psychology if the price in fiat.
I know a lot of people are doing circle jerks over the SEC review of the ETF. Sure it’ll boost the fiat price but touching on your point, the most important thing the approval will do is change public psychology for the masses.
A government agency for the worlds strongest economy giving bitcoin the stamp of approval will change the psychology of the average person.
We will see a rise in fiat price and this will synergize with the infrastructure that is currently being worked on creating a secure use case for bitcoin.
I find bakkt to be interesting as a early distribution model in getting people to use the currency.
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:45:19
Great video and great points, I could not agree more.
One point I disagree with or have a comment on is how you think the price will top out during the next cycle. Are you saying that the price will reach its peak and then we will see a left aligned cycle?
I honestly can’t see bitcoin stopping at a $200,000 usd valuation. I think it will go higher and reach a critical point in valuation. “Crossing of the rubicon”, if you will.
Once it breaches a point of no return, I think we will be in a period where the value transfer of fiat to bitcoin cannot be stopped or reversed.
Edit: I don’t think this event will happen during the next 4 year cycle you illustrated but do think within a 10 year window, it being a very very real possibility.

I think them taking away the hash will tank bitcoin prices till the difficulty resets. Once the difficulty resets, barrier of entry for new miners to enter will lower and network hash will return back to normal and these fuckers that went along with the NYA will lose the network hash dominance they once enjoyed, should they decide to re-enter into bitcoin mining.
It’s a very dangerous gamble for these idiots

Your perspective is limited. Your rationale is derived from your personal experiences. 
Do you have any idea what it’s like to have 100 million?
To you (and many of you), it seems like an insane amount of money. 
It’s JUST enough money to be comfortable but NOT enough money to be one generation removed from bankruptcy.
Fact of the matter is that “haves” vs “have nots” have different perspectives:
People that have wealth are trying to figure out ways in making sure it stays that way.

Logic is that there is so much money being printed (dilution to money supply in easy to obtain capital - ie inflation) that they charge you interest to encourage spending...this is in theory.
This negative interest rate was a thing for high net accounts...for example, say you had $500 million in cash laying around. A negative 1% interest rate is still outpacing a 2-3% inflation rate...though i believe the actual inflation rate to be a bit higher.
What is alarming is that they are beginning to apply this to small potatoes folks

I reckon if bitcoin devs decide to quit in droves, that
the Litecoin project is the one they’d could likely join. 
He’s very well respected in the community and Probably the most respected, outside a handful of core devs. Also, working on Litecoin would be a lateral move.
What would happen to bitcoin and it’s chances to scale in the future without this current development team?
Why should the current devs stay put if the S2x coupe is successful? They’d be working for the enemy.

The reason why they are not looking at it seriously is volatility. These guys are hired to protect and increase wealth and deal with hundreds of millions to billions.
