Wouldn't you say that the situation is way different right now? Much more explosive growth and media attention and therefore a much different audience which much different levels of stress and patience?
Seriously I barely understand crypto currencies but how can you possibly use 2014 as an example?

Just spam HODL and your money won't be gone, it must work, surely!

Wow lot's of people shouting "idiot" simply because the price ended up raising again after OP sold. Would have all been really quiet people if that hadn't happened. It's gambling, don't act like "you knew al allong" like some captain hindsight

How you can type this even after my edit is beyond me.
Anyway I asked this before and I'll ask you too: Wouldn't you say that the situation is way different right now? Much more explosive growth and media attention and therefore a much different audience which much different levels of stress and patience?

I got 1.24 btc at $1k loss right now. My dumb ass should have sold it when it was $19k+.
But yeah I'm starting to consider cutting losses here. Bitcoin hasn't ever made a downwards trend for so many days in a row and it just keeps falling. Hope I don't get destroyed by any bitcoin cultists on here.
Edit: Has* fallen fore more days in a row.
But, edit: It's still about the worst and longest crash since bitcoin *really* took off in november and I'm pretty sure that frightens people. Seeing as everyone and their moms have bought bitcoin wouldn't that be enough to make people panic and prevent bitcoin from ever rising to what it was before? I know I barely know what I'm talking about but triggering Bitcoin fanboys is the best way to spark an argument as you can see down below in some cases.

What makes you think the price will go up?

Sold 80% of my btc at $14000. Better to lose 1.5k than to lose 8k.

What do oyu mean by inputs? I don't think it allows me to export any keys... This is really stressful because now it's basically forcing me to stick with the bitcoins. Can't find anything when googling the issue either

Well I'm not sure about how fees are supposed to be normally but at the moment it's charging me 100 dollars worth of bitcoin.
I'm trying to send it from an adress that has had 1 transaction of 230"satoshis/vByte". But it won't show me the size of the transaction i'm trying to make
Edit: Just got it fixed, I lowered the priority of the transaction and then it would accept the transaction. Really strange :/
