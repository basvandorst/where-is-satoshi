I know several people who claimed to bypass their buying delays by opening a second account. Different email, same bank account. I also know of people who screwed up and accidentally had insufficient funds. All that happened was that transaction was canceled. I guess they could take someone to court, but the case would be pretty flimsy.

At this point it would be a pretty poor idea to "borrow" bitcoin, unless you're betting on a massive crash. Imagine you borrow 10 coins worth $800. You get $8000. By next month they might cost $1300. Now you owe 10 coins or $13,000.

@_date: 2013-12-07 07:07:09
look at your chart before the "first" bubble. That was the value based on usage as opposed to hype and speculation. Now pretend neither bubble happened. Follow that straight line to today's date and you have a realistic value based on normal, healthy growth. About $70 give or take. The crash momentum should push it temporarily below actual value temporarily. So about $30 until it balances out. 
You're making a mistake thinking the two bubbles are separate events. The first bubble was part of what caused the media attention that sparked the second, larger swell. But now it's over and the collapse will cause negative media, not another swell.

Sold at the end of the pop. At $775. I think/hope the majority here have only invested what they could afford to throw away. 
Actually using bitcoin is sensible. Holding as an investment is moronic at this point. Unless you understand that it's a very high risk investment with only a tiny chance of return. 
I hope to use bitcoin as currency.  But I won't buy to hold until I see it stable for two to three months.

Then just plane ol bullshit after that. None of those things have a damned thing to do with bitcoin's worth. 5% of Facebook, 21% of Twitter... So what? Not Facebook or Twitter or a single thing you mention have anything to do with bitcoin. You might as well compare it to chewing gum.
A bubble has nothing at all to do with debt. Where did you get that? Yes the housing bubble was fueled by debt. And borrowed money can make a bubble crash harder. But a bubble is just over valued commodity. 
In the last 30 days bitcoin has doubled and fallen the same amount. THAT IS a bubble. The only question now is where is the bottom.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:10:36
One major flaw with this logic. The video states that the blockchain will eventually need to be stored on industrial servers. That is true. But it is wrong in saying that will make bitcoin easier to regulate and trace. Any government agency allready has access to the complete blockchain file. We all do. It doesn't matter where it is stored.

The cost of mining currently only gives about a 10% return over the cost of electricity. Should an entity begin massive mining, the overall return would diminish to a point of losing money. 
Additionally, a tax increase of .000001% would outweigh every single bitcoin miner in operation. The U.S. loans itself more in a month than the total value of bitcoin, just to control interest rates. 
Finally, like it or not, bitcoin is unstable. No country on earth would risk it's resources on such a unprofitable speculation.

This article is a bit misleading. Don't be confused into thinking Gold has become a bad investment. Just the opposite. First, Gold is loosing value now because it was such a good investment. When the banks were going bad and the economy crashed, the wealthy started buying gold to weather the storm. Now the worst is over so they are selling off to get their working cash. They didn't loose money at all. They just stored it in Gold.
Mining stock is just stock. Completely separate from gold. If a major mining company goes belly up and its stock becomes worthless, it will not lower the value of gold. In fact it could make gold harder to buy and therefore more valuable. Secondly the stock prices are somewhat inaccurate. They are being sold under valued for tax reasons. To offset capital gains of other funds. Again almost no one is actually loosing money on them. They are still selling for more than they were purchased for. But they are being sold for less than last years reported value which shows an annual loss without actually loosing cash.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:05:46
I hope you're correct. I've been worried that the crash would come as people want their cash for Christmas shopping. If that's it, we better put on seat belts.

Honestly, China is the only reason I've decided to hold my little investment instead of cashing out. I don't know what's going on there, but they seem vested in keeping bitcoin afloat. I can see many reasons why they would do this. Including an opportunity to have control over the first worldwide currency.  Whatever the reason, it's hard to imagine it causing my 2-3 coins to loose value.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:52:41
Will do. I knew this would not be received well. Still I hate to see so many people take unneeded risk when there is no benifit. I agree Bitcoin will eventually reach record highs again. Think how much better that will be if you are able to buy more when the price is right. It seems bitcoin has become a religion rather than an investment. I will see you on the other side.

Alright if you can follow this. It's complicated. Here it is.
Bitcoin, like any currency. AIN'T WORTH SHIT. Not by itself anyway. It's value is controlled by two things.
1) Scarcity vs need.
2) Tinkerbell effect. Which means it is worth exactly what you believe it is worth.
As to  Almost no one is buying bitcoin out of need.  Bitcoin fills a need, but that ain't why the price skyrocketed. 
So it's  Belief and faith. So as soon as a percentage of people start to loose faith, the downward plunge begins.
Without  a true, concrete need, the price can literally go anywhere. And when it can go anywhere, it eventually drops to zero.
This happens all the time. So often that the effect can be plotted and anticipated. Without concrete need to hold the price steady, it will follow the same path as the beanie baby.
 You can try to understand or you can just keep smiling and trying to fart fairy dust.

I really think you are on to something.  I've been watching this bubble closely, it sure seems about to pop. I'm not sure though. Bitcoin is an oddity in that, in theory, it has value as currency. Sadly, almost everyone buying now has no intention of using it as currency, which means it will follow the curve just as any overvalued stock.

Okay not worthless per se. To me going from a diamond ring value to a couple big macs is pretty close though. I'm not predicting that, just pointing to the possibility. Should a single major entity suddenly accept bitcoin, it could explode 300% in a day. Walmart, Ebay, Amazon, Paypal, Western Union... even Duncan Doughnuts. One single sign of acceptance could have an enormous affect.

Not as it stands. That's what banks do. Not what paper wallets do. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:09
I have been aware of this. As it stands bitcoin will become unusable, but like all technology it can be fixed. Should bitcoin survive, I believe it should be possible to design major servers to hold the massive blockchain files, freeing home computers and cellphones to hold only the owners blocks. The bulk servers can then be queried to follow the blockchains for transaction and verifications. I have allready seen an android app that does not hold the blockchain database. Also online wallets like blockchain.info do not require you to synchronize the blockchain on your computer. 
So this isn't really new info. Of all the things that could destroy bitcoin, this is not a major hurdle.

Unless they have your credit card on file, you could most likely just take the money out of the account until coinbase cancels the transaction. And no you're not an asshole. Coinbase rapes people all day long. They cost me $400 today alone. I sent 2 coins from a wallet to them to sell. Blockchain showed they received the coins but they held them for three hours while the market crashed. So screw them.

My mistake your highness. For the briefest of moments I believed you mistakenly assumed that mining more coin could somehow cause to value to continue to rise. By $10,000 you must have meant you are buying $10k worth of coins, at it's truly unregulated value.

Honestly has me wondering how "random" these swings are. Imagine someone has 100 coins. If he started selling, the price would plummet. Then he waits for the fall to stop and starts buying. The price jumps back up. He made a quick thousand dollars.
People use to play stocks that way. It takes huge amounts of stock to do it, and it's traceable. Bitcoin is so sensitive, one person could do it anonymously.

A commodity is only worth what the lowest person is selling it for. China, or any country, or any person can lower the value until they are sold out.
On the plus side, If they are causing the crash alone, it will bounce back when they quit selling and their coins are absorbed into the market.

You understand that when we say "China is buying Bitcoin" we don't actually mean the government of China, right? Destroying bitcoin would have less affect on China than designing a new cellphone. Much less. 
Look Bitcoin is great. I got some. I'm all for it. But don't go thinking world powers are gonna rise up against each other over it. Let me teach you some math.
20 million bitcoins times $1000 dollars each = $20 billion
Say china owns 25%. That's $5 billion.
The Washington Post reports that the Iraq war cost $720 million a day.
$5 billion / $720 million = 6.94 days
China's bitcoin would not pay for a one week war. Except acctually China has $0 in bitcoin. So... We are not protected by military.

This is not an attempt to ban Bitcoin. It is an attempt to prevent it's use for illegal activity and to limit it's impact on China's economy. A wise course of action for China, and other governments.
In easy language...
Part 1) Defines Bitcoin quite well.
Part 2) Basically forbids any legal financial institution from using bitcoin period. This does not make Bitcoin Illegal. It creates a protective barrier  between bitcoin and normal currency. This section protects China's currency wisely.
Part 3) Demands that websites adhere to the laws that already exist. They must register legally and report activities as any other online business. 
 **Part 4) Prevent money laundering usage.** This is the big one. The biggest point here is that websites using bitcoin must force users to use there real identities. This is a huge deal because one of bitcoin's main functions is allowing anonymity. This makes such usage illegal. It does not prevent China users from converting cash into bitcoin. It simply states that it must be recorded as any other asset. This was technically already the law, but now the website can be held responsible. This clearly defines the legal responsibility of the bitcoin exchange and could drastically alter bitcoin usage in china. 
Part 5) Provide "public education on money knowledge and investment risk". Pretty cool actually. Not a restriction at all. Free knowledge so that users can make better informed choices on their own.
Nothing bad here. Just protecting their banking industry and preventing fraud and laundering. Nothing preventing merchants or websites from accepting Bitcoin. Nothing preventing anyone from buying, selling, or using bitcoin. All in all an amazing show of tollerance from a new leader in world economics. Disappointing to see any government involvement but encouraging to see the recognition. Overall a step forward for bitcoin acceptance and usage. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:33:57
This guy is 100% correct. The current bitcoin price exceeds it's value by about 30x. The only possibility it has is if this frenzy entices Sellers to begin accepting it as currency, giving some validity to it's trade value. Otherwise it's a time bomb. As soon as the price stops raising people will get bored and want their cash.  When that selling starts the price will lower then the fear will kick in. Then crash.  Bitcoins selling for fifty cents. In less than a day.
Don't want that? Better convince a major portion of online sellers to take bitcoin, and fast.

This is the shit that can make it work. I've posted some dire predictions. Just a tiny stream of mom and pop's would be enough to make me happily wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:56:05
I would, but I sold at $800. Ill buy back when it's stable again. No matter the price.

I've been pissing people off with the truth for two weeks. The sad thing is, if people would just set emotion aside, bitcoin is still a money maker even if it crashes below a dollar. Forget the get rich fantasy and use some common sense.

I wouldn't necessarily call going from $100 to $90 a "plummet". More of a fluctuation really.  A dip. 
A roller coaster plummets. That was more of a trolley type thing.

Look, relax dude. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. And I'm not saying a government wont try to influence bitcoin exchange value. What I am saying is bitcoin is decentralized and unregulated. So no government backup. None at all. Ever. 
That's the cost of using decentralized currency. That and insane fluctuations in exchange rate.

The first bubble was caused by Silkroad closing, which not only gave a little media attention but also removed bitcoin's primary stabilizing usage as currency.
The "second" bubble was caused by explosive media attention causing a possative feedback loop. The price went up, more media, more buyers, price goes up, etc... At that time it was new to almost everyone. 
But it can only be new once. And most media attention now is mixed or negative.
But finally, and most importantly, Bitcoin is an attempt at currency. Currency is only really worth what it can buy. And bitcoin can't buy much. Someday but not now. Any purchase of currency as a speculation above it's value is just plain stupid. Think about it, would you buy a euro or a yen for twice what it can buy? If so then I have a stack of ten dollar bills i will sell you for twenty dollars each. No one is that stupid.
Let bitcoin settle down. When it reaches it's true spending value, I'll buy some more.

Gonna assume you're not a crook just for the sake of conversation. A) I hope no one here is stupid enough to sell bitcoin through papal. B) If you bought a prepaid card, why not just buy a gift card and use one of the sites that accept gift cards?

It's down for most. Probably not down so much as over run. Mtgox was sputtering too. Tons of people trying to bail.

This Bitcoin is some strange stuff. Keeps poking along. At literally any moment it could be worthless. At least it aint boring.

That would roughly be the green line to "D". You're discounting the path and returning to the last known stable price. And you could be correct. Very likely.
Bitcoin is an oddity though. Just as the speculation hit, it's primary use, the silk road, disappeared.  But then it began to be used in the real world. It became a new product mid-bubble with new real-usage value. That's why had I considered "B" a likely outcome. But I have doubts now. I think nothing like this has ever happened. It's as if in the middle of the beanie baby craze, they suddenly became toy trucks.
But yes, less than $200 and soon.

"passphrase" to what? A software like multibit?  Or an encryption passphrase, like brain wallet?

Okay, if you want a serious answer, I will explain it. But first, people here are pretty excited about bitcoin. All worked up so please, I don't need a hundred responses telling me this could NEVER happen. I already know what you think will happen so just calm down.


The answer is that doesn't have to happen. Bitcoin has no anchor. Nothing to fix it's value at a certain rate. It is literally worth what people are willing to buy and sell it for. So if one person chooses to sell some coin for half what it is worth, then that's what it is worth until someone else successfully sells it for more. It only takes one seller to lower the value. At least temporarily. 
So what happens is someone sells low. People see the price going down and start selling to get cash before the price drops. The more people sell, the lower the price goes until it stops. Not everyone has to agree to this, just the handful of people willing to sell. Last night, on mtgox, bitcoin drpped from $1240 to $870. The price dropped 30%. Did everyone agree to that? Of course not. Just a very few people made it happen.
Bitcoin is out of control. No other product on earth swings +-30% over night. The value is swinging back and forth and it's getting worse. Right now it is being propped up by faith, and the onlything keeping it from crashing is new investors. Enough people believe that the price will return so that when it drops, there are buyers. But one fine day that price will drop 30% or 40% or 50% and enough owners will get scared that they just keep selling. When that happens, it happens fast. Something that was worth $1200 is now worth $12. It can happen in just a few minutes.
That's why real money is regulated. Either backed by Something with a fixed value like gold, silver or even wheat. Or regulated by other means like the United States Federal Reserve. But bitcoin has no control.

That's the gamblers motto. I made almost all my money back.

I think I am starting to wrap my head around it. A wallet holds a value, how we name the division is up to popular usage. It seems unlikely the bitcoin will be adjusted, as that would require a universal acceptance and replacement of all related software. But should usage become common, new names for smaller fractions can appear with no authority but those who use it. For example: A millibit might be used for 0.001 coin. On the other hand something arbitrary might pop up. Like a "Billy Bob" might mean 0.000673. If everyone accepts it, then it is real.
To me, it seems bitcoin likely has only two possible futures. Gain acceptance, or dwindle away. Should it gain wide acceptance, growth will likely be such that complete coin usage becomes as rare as a thousand dollar bill.

In one sense, it created new wealth. But not really. Imagine two people. One has nothing. The other has $100. So the total of their wealth is $100. Now the person with nothing mines a coin and sells it to the other for $100. Now he has $100 and the other person has $100 worth of coin. So their total value is now $200.
However there is a downside that is harder to understand. The more money there is, the more things cost. So when you create "new wealth" you are actually just moving wealth around. Scarcity gives wealth it's value. That's why we don't just print enough money to make everyone rich. And that's one of the many reason China wants to treat Bitcoin as a commodity instead of money. So actually no new wealth was created. New money was created so other money became slightly less valuable.

Seems legit. Let me just get my neighbor's checkbook...

A negative truth is a truth none the less. Closing your eyes will not protect you from oncoming traffic. Bitcoin is unstable. If you want to see the silver lining, a correction in value may help stabilize it as a currency, which will open the door for legitimate usage as opposed to mindless speculation.

Income is income. Gain is gain. Loss is loss. I can't see why anyone was ever confused about this. If you sneak it through, well your choice. Unreported holdings or gains is illegal. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:36:18
The thing is, what people don't get, bitcoin is not a money making investment. It is a money. If it ever settles down and becomes stable, it won't matter what the exchange rate is. It's just a type of money.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:12:51
As you may recall, I told you the country of China did not own any bitcoin and would not provide military support to back it. This document proves my point. China has formally restricted commingling bitcoin with standard currency and openly declared that it can not be insured. Basically stating that any who choose to invest must accept the risk and do not have goverment support or protection.
Exactly what I told you they would say.


You claimed the Chinese military would be used to thwart any attempt to devalue Bitcoin. Kind of the opposite of this.

An apology on reddit. A rare treat. Thank you. Like I said, I could be wrong. 
Ride it out if you want. But it doesn't make me the bad guy for wanting to make sound choices to feed my family. Or for offering sound investment advise 
Go [here]( Hit bitstamp and six month. Then tell yourself what you see happening. Bitcoin has dropped 10% since my warning three hours ago. It could bottom out as low as $30 -$75 and then rebound at about twice that. If so, somebody could sell one coin now for about $700.00 Then buy maybe 14 coins at about $50 and quickly end up with $1400 worth of coins. And if I'm wrong. Just buy back when you want and you lost nothing. Just my hypocritical douchebag opinion, as an emotional child here called me.
Thanks for the apology. Good luck and be happy.
Edit : too long and preachy.
