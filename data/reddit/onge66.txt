per spin what is the chance of winning at all. And then per spin what is the chance to win 3x coins and so on. Or maybe even percent of people who have played and won vs ppl who have lost. For me, having some sort of percentage to look at is nice. But as I said I don't really play slots much or gamble in general so maybe what I'm saying doesn't make sense.

Having a few people start thinking of bitcoins as being worth more won't suddenly or even slowly change the value of them.

My only comment would be perhaps make the % to win say 2x, 3x, or whatever visible (I don't know how to calculate that). But then again I'm not really familiar with slots anyway.

Everyone panicing, if you want to talk about true panic just wait for the dollar to collapse.

I wouldn't be surprised if this actually makes bitcoin more attractive in Russia.

damn hackers using their fancy technology to steal those insecure dollars, I'm glad all my money is in cattle. I'd like to see someone hack a cow!

At least try and make it funny, I liked this from your first post
"If you need more Bitcoin you ask me, I will create and give."
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:00:21
This is amazing.

I don't think destroying 90,000 coins would have an immediate effect on the price.

He's not a big supporter of BTC. He's said he thinks the price will continue to decline, but of course that he could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:57:46
I like you.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:46:08
gotta pick up some momentum for the bounce ;)

Probably not the answer you're looking for but: you should make that decision for yourself. That being said I don't think any time is a bad time to support Bitcoin if you like the technology/ideas it represents. Bitcoin isn't intended for people to 'make a quick buck', use it at your own discretion
