"...that governments will protect the value of government-created money..." I will admit this is the only thing that's kept me from throwing all my faith in bitcoin. If bitcoin gets to the point where it becomes a threat to the dollar, or the government whatsoever, poof, it will be gone. I can promise that

How does this sub reddit feel about coinbase? I just bought some through them today. To me they seem like the most secure for someone who isn't completely confident about setting up their own paper wallet. Plus they said they keep 90% of funds in cold storage? Seems like a safe bet to me

Yeah, but cocaine is a good, not a medium of extchange. Wouldn't banning a way to buy and sell goods decrease the purchasing power of bitcoin? Especially if a lot less transactions were happening as a result?

Blockchain.info also has a tutorial to make a paper wallet through them. Both options are secure

I'm no expert either, I'm fairly new to the whole thing, but I think the general idea is that comparing it to the dollar would be a way of measuring the actual value of one bitcoin. So as the "price" goes up, so does the bitcoin's purchasing power in relation to the dollar. At least that's how I see it, someone can correct me if I'm wrong

Does anyone know if this affects people who bought before this? For example I bought a coin last Friday, and it's supposed to hit my account Thursday, will that be delayed now?

I had the same problem and was worried about it until the next day my funds hit the account. If you read the FAQ they talk about how some banks have been messing up, hence the delays. Honestly at this point I have nothing but good things to say about coinbase. I'm sure the influx of transfers have been off the charts as of late and they've still been able to honor all transactions I've made. Not to mention I've never had my price altered after the price of coins went up-they lock it in from the second you buy it.
