Nice answer. But still, a username like skoolsuxxs1 (cause skoolsuxx was taken I guess) makes it hard for me to take you seriously.

Crypto news, always two steps behind.

Didn't even notice his username. Well on the upside, Lambokids are a good way for new fiat to enter the cryptospace.

Unless you buy at 10k and the price drops to 5k. Think about what you'd do than... 
And taxes depend on where you live. In some countries there aren't any clear regulations yet.

If he dies, he dies... 
No ofcourse nobody would... But what if you only have about 30k now and can only make enough to have 50-70k in two years. Who you make this gamble or try other things.

Just sell their house too, so you can buy lots of BTC at this price. Than even if BTC hits 11k you'll have enough to buy both the house and car back.
Its really easy.

I never said I would take the gamble. Just changed the question OP asked.
@_date: 2019-08-04 06:50:15
Than just go through the house and sell everything else, like TV, fridge, any siblings, sell it all.

Sounds good, mailed you my private keys and credit card details.

It says free Bitcoin! Go for it! Don't even need to watch it.
Lots of people on the interwebz give away money. Its an awesome businessmodel.
@_date: 2019-02-26 07:52:13
Just... wtf
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:10:56
They added one line at the end: 'and whatever you do, don't ever invest in...'

A million people made a million predictions about Crypto. Nice one Sherlock.

Nice, she met the Logness monster and Elvis too so must be legit!

Well one would need to understand how to use crypto, not how it works. This is still a problem,   for a lot of people don't know how to buy or use crypto. 
And an even important factor is understanding the reasons to use it. 
For western consumers paying with crypto is kinda pointless. Your bank card is faster and easier to use. Consumers don't care about the process after the transaction. And unless you have truckloads of money, banks aren't that expensive. So why is crypto usefull. People have to understand this first. 
And why is it? Big money tx, cross boarder payments, autonomy, no need to move fiat around behind the screens. I am convinced crypto is the future, even more so for blockchain usage for privacy and autonomy over user data. But is it usefull for the averge consumer at the moment, other than an investment?

Looking at your previous posts you also want a job in IT while you currently have no relevant experience or education. Next to that you want to put all your money in Bitcoin?
I'd say go for it, whats the worst that can happen right..?

You can't disable an adress, but if you send me your private key, I'll make sure it empty.
