yeah, it's not likely that they will go far up any time soon. and quite a high chance of them plummeting if DHS blocks other vendors...
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:49:27
Got them mixed up again, uh.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:44:42
nah, I still have 800, just lost some dollar reserves I keep on MtGox in case the price plumments below $40 :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:56:42
Yeah, I should do it, especially when ~50% of my net worth is in Bitcoins currently.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:12:14
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:46:39
there should be some good news coming up with the conference...
on the other hand, the true risk would be that DHS decided they don't like BTC and want to bring it down..
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:48:54
I still believe traders provide liquidity.

Thanks for this :) As for the Google Authenticator - it doesn't use cookies, and I have it on a non-jb'd iPhone, so I feel quite safe about it. Wouldn't want to rely only on just one form of authentication.
As for 1) - yeah, I plan to move most of the funds to the paper wallet, or generate a brainwallet using Electrum. Still though - a mistake here, and a lot of my savings are gone...
3) thanks, I've got this covered
4) yeah, I checked that after the faweksyGirl's post
Would tip if this were not a throwaway account :) Thanks.

800btc + $40k on mtgox with two factor
and 100btc spread between blockchain.info (web), blockchain.info (iphone), coinbase, and mpex.
I trust more in mtgox than in my ability to not mess up a wallet creation process on a dedicated laptop.

Yeah, I lost some when market fluctuated in December 2012. Decided back then to never trade again (only investments). On the other hand, I broke the promise during the crash a month ago, and ended up quite profitable...
Cheers! :)

If I believe BTC will fall in price very soon, and very much, I'm better off selling now, than transferring to another exchange (which takes ~3 hours) and selling then.

I'm just panicked about making a mistake somewhere and not being able to reimport the wallet when the time comes...
But you guys convinced me to give it a try.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:02:05
well, this weak hand helped a lot when it was crashing from $250 a month ago :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:45:26
It's like a bitcointip, but for the whole community! :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:53:37
It's not because of the price (it's not the first dip since I bought them), it's because of the news about Dwolla. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:29:25
Why do you assume I cannot afford to lose this? :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:42:22
Yup. At least without reading a book or two on the subject :(
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:12:46
you bastard ;)
but seriously. I look at the chart, and there was just one dip below 110. And that probably was me. Uh.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:11:44
by what was that one supported?
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:57:31
Yeah, after all the comments I think I'll move to offline after all..
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:41:46
if I were trading, I could still be trading on MtGox, even in US.
if I wanted to withdraw my funds, wire transfers still work in US afaik.
