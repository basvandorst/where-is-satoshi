Exactly, what if anyone from the core team is using this as a reverse psychology? Core buys an old account, shills for Roger, and then blame Roger for shilling? Sounds pretty easy.

Some inaccuracies:
1. Difficulty can only go up 4x at a time.
2. After the difficulty goes up in 2 days, if the miners jump back to BTC, BCH would not be "frozen". They actually have a downward difficulty correction algorithm in place. If there are less than 6 blocks found in a 12 hour period, the difficulty drops dramatically.

People selling their Bitcoins for another cryptocurrency is not "spam transactions". These are legit transactions of people sending their coins to exchanges to buy, you know what. Who pays 5$ / transaction to create spam?

We'll see.

I think we are already past the ignore and laugh part. We are fighting them right now. And they are winning.

Fuck that greedy miner for acting selfishly just like Satoshi envisioned.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:53:24
Lol. Cool down. I am on your side. Distributed consensus is a very hard problem. Satoshi found the right solution. Demonizing the miners doesn't take you anywhere. Miners are supposed to act selfishly and greedily, according to the Satoshi's solution. If you don't believe in Satoshi's words, you should go back to using Fiat, where you can cry about people "cheating", being "greedy" etc etc.

What probably means is that the people in this sub first ignored BU, then laughed at it, and then fought it, and are now losing. So its kinda ironic.

They promised a certain TH/s, and delivered it. So, how is it a scam again?

Whatever happened to "no altcoins" rule?

Tell me how does Node count matter now, when it did not matter for XT?
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:39:48
You get what you pay for. Its like Cisco routers and switches that are "software locked". Basically all their switches have similar hardware, but features are locked in software. The more you pay, the more you get out of the switch.

When BU comes close to activating, all the exchanges and services supporting UASF or SegWit now will scramble to change their nodes to BU. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:32:34
Again, I didn't ask for arguments in favor of one solution. And i disagree, that we haven't moved forward due to mining centralization. Even the Mining community is highly divided. About 40% each are signaling for segwit and BU. None has enough support to safely activate either. We need a compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:05:48
BU is 45% of the hashrate. From 0 to 45 in 3 months.

Asicboost Scam???? I can swallow it being called cheating. But scam?

Apparently the OP (one whose thread in the other sub is the topic of this thread) at one point owned about 3800 bitcoins. 
Edit: Links to the address that he verified that he owned:

Which part of his claim is a lie though? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:35:03
The other side agreed to compromise, from 32mb to 8mb to 2mb. And they agreed to SegWit even though they hate it, just for a chance to bring the community together again. It is this side that has REFUSED to budge even an inch!
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:36:02
Most of them were banned here for bringing logical arguments. They needed a place to discuss Bitcoin freely.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:46:07
Good, name calling when you don't have a response backed by logic.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:38:05
Crypto won't fail, but Bitcoin with its current stalemate might.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:11:17
We are in a stalemate because core devs and BlockStream are refusing to compromise even a little bit. If they had stuck to their promise of a 2mb HF + segwit, instead of making lame excuses to back out, we would have scaled months ago.
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:19:37
It is. I have unlimited bandwidth, and I only pay about 30 USD per month.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:44:29
At this point it doesn't matter which proposal is the best. The whole point of this thread is to discuss compromise. The definition of compromise is "an agreement or a settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions." So, yea, we will have to settle for a less than optimal solution to keep the community together.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:40:06


Citation needed for that. I run a full node, and I have zero such complaints.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:59:24
SegWit + 16mb. Or no compromise!
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:36:12
Illogical analogy. How can you compare two proposals of scaling Bitcoin network with food and poison?
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:35:20
BIP 141 (or, SegWit) is NOT a compromise. It's a point of contention that has divided the community into two.
Edit: 2mb HF + Segwit was a compromise, which most of you have backed out of.
