Because there is a block size limit that is smaller than market demand.

I think bitcoin's key strength is that it is usable, for cheap and fast.
Or rather, was. Please stop eroding these features please. While lying about larger block sizes being the devil. It's transparent.

Why would the price fall?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:26:08
Just trust and believe. Stop thinking. Stop asking questions.

The block size limit has existed for years. The only new thing is the quantity of transactions.
Segwit was promised a partial solution, though those promises have obviously gone totally unfulfilled so far.
Edit: for those downvoting, please provide me with counter-evidence so I can stop being wrong. Show me how Segwit has done anything at all to help the problem as promised.

**How is this misleading?** That's exactly what he said, and what he meant.
I think the tag should be "I wish he hadn't said this".

Where is the logic behind this assumption?
1. There is no price point that bitcoin cash mining is unprofitable no matter what. The difficulty adjusts. Obviously.
2. Why would any of this cause bitcoin cash's price to go down?

Bitcoin is like the DMV. Nice.

They are leaving it for days at a time it seems. With a few hours respite.

Segwit had 30-40% support prior to segwit2x agreement.
How is that fault? How did they do it? Like, what actions did they take to cause 60% of the miners to not signal for Segwit?

All fee's are public. Could you cite an example?

The condition being "If you agree with me"? I'm pretty sure that's implicit in every single person's recommendation for everything all of the time.

Feel like answering my questions? Or are you just here to spout the crazy things you feel like spouting?

Though crime detected.

Yep.
