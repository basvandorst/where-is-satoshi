Not sure why so many are dissing you for wearing a fancy ring. I think it's pretty cool. I wouldn't wear it often, but it'd be nice to have just so you could really stick it to a real life buttcoiner. Plus, I bet it would be great for starting conversations about bitcoin (if they are willing to hear it, ofc).
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:36:14
Woo! Buy, buy, buy!
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:31:52
It's kinda sad. These people could easily learn how to bitcoin and start making money if they would just stop being so damn jealous.
@_date: 2014-07-13 03:19:20
To be honest, it's difficult to say, because new ones are coming up daily. I could share my favorite coins with you and why, but it's all speculation at this point. Right now is a great time to invest in the ALT market because everyone is so BTC bullish. It's hard to say how much you'd have today - I've been playing since last btc bubble, and I've made several BTC on a few coins....also lost a couple on others (temporarily though)
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:46:19
Heh yeah...he's a busy guy. And that's kinda why I'd like him to go, so he can learn and meet some of bitcoin's greatest.

Best part is knowing I can hodl my stash for another 6-12 months, regardless of price.
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:45:02
Tried that method already. It seems to have the opposite effect after each confirmed purchase.
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:25:04
I disagree. Sorry, but I'm not donating to anything if they don't accept bitcoin. There's no reason for me to give out sensitive information to be charitable. It's too easy to accept them...kinda selfish of any charity to not accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:13:27
I believe it will get better. Maybe they are targeting the less tech, but desperate to get involved and start spending bitcoin crowd.

Just stop buying unless they offer a really good deal. Hodling is simple.
@_date: 2014-07-13 02:27:25
I'd research the coins extensively before making a purchase. I've been holding over 4 btc worth of various coins on cryptsy since December, but I trust their service more than most. And no, you don't need to download their individual wallets. Also, you can give folks your cryptsy trade key to receive tips from any currency.

Because the middle class is basically non-existent. Have you seen the rate of inflation and stats on income inequality in America? Is it fair to bailout banks without giving into the needs of some protesters? America is one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world, while at the same time we have children starving, very low social mobility, and high suicide rate among veterans. How does that make sense to you?
