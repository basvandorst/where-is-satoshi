I am not too familiar with US patent law, so correct me if I am wrong;
Something that is public knowledge cannot be patented, correct?
If that is the case, we at emax.io have a piece of software similar to the functionality of the patent we can release open source.

In my opinion decentralized exchanges have their place in the market, and they will work for certain things, however, the durability and performance issues mean only centralized exchanges can provide a liquid enough market to have efficient price discovery. 
Basically, each trade in an orderbook requires several messages to complete, each message has a latency, this latency depends on the internet connection between Trader A, Trader B and the decentralized market, lets say for the sake of the argument 10ms. 
This is too high latency to be efficient, even if we assume only a minimal amount of messages is needed, 1 from each trader to insert the order in the orderbook, and then 1 message to match the orders, 2 transactions to credit and debit the amounts on each blockchain, and 1 message to remove the orders from the orderbook once funds are released, this would mean a latency of each trade around at least 30ms. 
That means each orderbook at best can handle about 33.3 trades per second (1000ms/30ms), no matter what algorithmic magic you throw at this problem, that simply isn't enough for most things.

Would like to know what went wrong, not just to know why you lost 5M USD, but also so the community and other exchanges can learn from your mistakes.
I dont see how releasing technical information on how the attack took place has anything to do with the forensics related to the legal side of the case.

The correct term is actually an MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility), not a broker. 
The difference being; 
Broker: Executes orders on behalf of client, and is licensed to hold and control client funds.
MTF: Facilitates exchange of financial instruments between multiple parties, and is licensed to hold and control client funds.

This topic is a little more nuanced than freedom in the corner with decentralized exchange vs evil in the corner  with regulated markets.
Trades take a comparatively long time to clear on decentralized exchanges, where as a centralized exchange can match and clear a trade in nanoseconds. This is important because it is what determines the current price, which means pricing will be less efficient on a decentralized exchange and likely result in a higher spread (you are not forgetting about the spread when calculating your trading fee are you?)
It will also have a negative effect on liquidity since market makers are less likely to provide bid/ask walls at the spread price.
In relation to security, I am personally of the opinion that no sane person would be inclined to store any significant wealth without the assistance of a financial institution. It has benefits that outweigh the risks such as depositor insurance, not having to worry about what a private key is and how you lose your money if you lose it, and so on.

Depends on the structure, but if the two entities are truly separate, as in settles accounts separately and is not a subsidiary of the US entity, it is plausible that it creates a soft barrier. When the hammer falls trade agreements settle in however, and a full audit happens whether it is a US or UK entity no matter what.

There is a good reason that Bitcoin core development is highly consensus based, and while likening the project to Linux makes sense in part because the software enables an underlying value far surpassing that of Bitcoin in the shape of webservices running on Linux based systems, it is also an unfair comparison when considering that distributions like Debian and Fedora in turn choose what kernel version they use and in some cases modify it to the specific distro's needs. In the case of Bitcoin we all need to agree on how the protocol works, because of that Bitcoin is much more similar to protocols, where similar consensus mechanics are in play when changes are considered. An example would be switching to IPv6 which is going to be a painful process, and in the case of Finance, switching from legacy FIX protocols to newer versions.

That would also imply separating the order books, and significantly reducing liquidity on the NY market.

Technically? If so, by using NXT, Counterparty, Ethereum, pick your flavour.
Legally? A whole different and much more complicated topic...

Doesn't really improve decentralization of mining, the hashing power is insignificant, mining is a specialized profession akin to running a data centre, it is much harder to do right than you might think.
The only result of a mining chip in every device really is to make the device draw more power. In terms of acquiring Bitcoin/other crypto for paying the fees your apps use, the cheapest option is to simply buy them on the open market.
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:38:27
I agree with you, the chip seems more like a gimmeck, and could be easily swapped out for a subscription model.

Awesome work! :) First real world example of IoT?
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:16:46
Sure, but the core functionality is there already - smart contracts, i don't think PoS will have any significant added utility value for example.

Implementing the 2-way peg in Bitcoin to enable sidechains is likely going to take quite a while and be riddled with much the same bullshit as we have seen with the blocksize debate. Now, consider that the 2-way peg introduces new code in the core codebase, while the blocksize depending on which suggestion gets accepted, introduces almost no code changes. I imagine sidechains are quite a while off in the distance.
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:03:54
Have been using Ethereum during frontier and it is performing quite well so far.
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:11:18
Depends on which implementation we are talking about, but yeah you are right - GPLv3 is used for a lot of the repos.
The more important side though is the mentality of the people involved in the project - this code was put into the world to benefit as many as possible, if anything i think V is happy that people are using the code to create new things :)
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:36:40
True, i don't think that is exclusive to Ethereum however, it seems the general trend in the industry is a race to the bottom on prices of services. This is largely due to the extraordinarily low barrier of entry of blockchain based services, where even if regulation applies it is almost impossible to enforce.
There is also the technological side of finding a fit, if that is what you mean. But I believe the technology is maturing at a much faster pace than you would think. I think the first year of capital investment in Ethereum related companies will rival the Bitcoin industry of 2014, this is considering IoT companies are looking into the technology. There is also a good chance that Ethereum will be used for recreating financial instruments with increased transparency, it is already being used to create IoU's on gold and other assets for example.

Yes it did, loads of improvements done to it though, if implemented with a webshop solution such as opencart so you can syncronize stock with webshop and maybe across multiple stores. This system could be the next big thing :)

Mijoshop + Joomla works really well with bitcoin integration. 
Mijoshop is based on Opencart, so most payment gateways work with it, that includes Bitcoin payment gateways. :)
