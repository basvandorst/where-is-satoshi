Guns are irrelevant in my society. 
If you need guns because "they are a great equalizer" then I'd wager that law an  order in your society is breaking down.

I'm not paying for bandwidth at the moment, but the bandwidth I'm using is shaped and capped during peak hours, but not during off peak hours. Pretty standard in my country for around 30 usd a month.

Everyone has a data cap, they just don't talk about it because they assume you won't hit it. 
It's impossible to have no data cap. Bandwidth is a limited resource.

It must be so fucking annoying being into crypto and being an American. They bang on about freedom a lot but from my perspective the only freedoms they get are the ones that are irrelevant (GUNS AMIRITE), with freedoms that actually matter being heavily restricted.

When the average global salary is 1.5k a month you have a warped sense of normal if you are paying over 100USD a month just for bandwidth.

You can objectively understand technology. Technology is the fundamental basis for this whole market.
Faith and perception are subjective. The market is irrational and doesn't care about technology, but that irrationality makes to _hard_ to predict based on just perception and faith. 
I place a much higher value on the tech/fundamental side of market analysis, because at least we can all reliably learn and understand tech.  You can't do that with faith or peception.
