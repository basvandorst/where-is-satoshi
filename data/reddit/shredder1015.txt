Find coins/tech that you are actually interested in. Makes it a lot more enjoyable. Also, if you truly believe in a project, do yourself a favor and hold it for more than a month.

You are correct. GDAX is heating up FAST 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:22:57
So you're too young to go to a bar but you have a 6 month old?
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:08:20
Correct, I should have clarified. I mainly posted this because it does have some very useful information. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:25:28
Been like that for months 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:20:51
I downvoted your comment because it was completely random and extremely old news.

Absolutely insane to watch.... I should've been in bed hours ago but this is ridiculous. May have just purchased some more at 10.7

That sucks, I've been using coinbase for over a year on android and PC and I've had zero issues. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:00:56
I always have a hard time understanding how anyone can ignore the returns of these "shitcoins".... I have made 13x more off shitcoins than bitcoin lmfao

Every time you sell/shapeshift/go from one coin to another you incur a taxable event.

Can we stop posting these idiotic questions?

"This shark tank guy wants to launch"...... What the hell are you talking about? All he said is "I'm involved and under NDA"..... The owner of the hotel is the one pulling the strings.... 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:45:40
Its been quite awhile now

"There is no incentive from the crypto community to do this" What? Profit isn't a good incentive? I sold a significant amount of my portfolio earlier today. Its called adapting. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:09:29
Its not a scam.

Mount it up high and install a small duct (ideally with a fan) to vent hot air out window

Well, you claim to be a computer science student, so maybe do some research? *not on reddit* 
Also, how is energy limited? We have a massive sun, and a lot of water.
I'm a poorly educated construction worker and I had no problem finding several appropriate responses.

Not bad, seems like a watered down version of Livecoinwatch

If by "private messages" you mean righteous javelins of truth straight into the brain then I am receiving them.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:13:16
What makes you think some randoms on reddit have an explanation? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:01:19
Don't ask questions like this on reddit if you're actually trying to gather reliable information... Do your own work
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:02:38
Oh yeah, 300hp, electronically-adjustable suspension, pretty incredible vehicle when in good shape. 
BUT, as you said, repairs can get expensive. I have a 2-bay garage and most tools, so I do most of the work myself. Thats the only way to own a Volvo/Audi/Mercedes/BMW/VW when you're stingy like I am. I've done jobs for $100 and a few hours that mechanics/dealers would've charged $1500 for. 
Plus most of them don't give a damn about your car lol

Lmfao based on the idea that you're buying after over 24 hours of big gains..... I expect it to drop 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:51:45
"How is it even possible to have a gain/loss".... Um... I would argue the opposite... How is it possible to NOT have a gain/loss. The values of BTC and ETH are constantly changing... 
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:16:53
I love how a crypto "lull" can still yield 40-50% returns each month.. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:06:26
Depends on the person... Some hodl because they're idiots. 
Some hodl because they don't want to pay taxes 
Some hodl because they're lazy
Some hodl because they're delusional 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:10:13
LOL I agree... I went out and purchased a 2006 Volvo V70R... Might actually turn into an investment due to rarity. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:12:22
A long time and a lot of electricity 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:15:14
Did you seriously just type "provements" lol
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:06:52
That was captivating, HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:04:34
Is this supposed to be surprising or intriguing?
