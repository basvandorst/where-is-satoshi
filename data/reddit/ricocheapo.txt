situations like this are how marriages begin to crumble into divorce. outside of the obvious trust issues that will arise from secret investments, losing other people's money is going to ignite an already bad situation. that's why.

if we used the car horse analogy, how can your car be so much slower, with almost zero hope of catching up? Do you not see the reality of your situation?? Most of you lost at least 50% of your assets, and hold out hope because of shit shit tech that will never work......... have you ever read the whitepaper?? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:04:55
just because you have been in this space for many years does not exclude you from being an idiot. the only reason you think i am being a dickhead is because you  cannot deal with reality... what's the BTC price at? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:46:28
OK there warren buffet. How do you know when to sell? What if everybody sold when the price fell?  Did you predict the recent crash?
And the thing about money is, it is no good as money if it doesn't hold value. Are all of you really this blind???

my point was that his point was not true (LN every day) and comparing it to an actual viable payment infrastructure... Btw, how is your crypto portfolio doing?? Don't you wish you just cashed out to see crypto without the bias of heartbreaking comedy gold you provide to our subreddits? 
Today? Tomorrow? 5 Years? How about this for a prediction. LN is DOA. Who is their right mind will lock up funds in a payment channel, that can and will lose value based on whale exchange activity? good luck buddy. you guys need it. Thanks for the entertainment.

so let's go back to the horse and say, "since it will never be faster than a car, let's give it PEDs". good in theory, bad in practice and longevity. Popcorn at the ready! When you have a revolution, it's 2X better and 1/2 the price. In the internet age, it's 10X better + free. 
When you eventually grow up and venture outside of your world, you will see that Bitcoin has already been bypassed by WePay, AliPay, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and the 200 other start ups working on payment. The difference is that the US dollar holds value, while Bitcoin does not. You cannot build a stable infrastructure when the tectonic plates are moving under your foundations. 
The definition of money is: 
* Store of Value
* Medium of Exchange
* Unit of account
Bitcoin has one of these.... LN does not address the core fundamentals of money. Having 4000 LN does not make it a medium of exchange (4000 vs 35M). The only thing you have is Unit of Account, which is the blockchain. Boring....... 
The white paper is some convoluted POS, the perfect example of when you let an engineer do some without any restraints, that has no valid business case or real world applications or practicality. Think, Wozniak without Jobs. He would have just given it away until Jobs stepped in to create a $2B Co in the 1980s.  
I feel bad for most of you because I can see the mental gymnastics you need to perform to justify holding onto a losing (heading to zero) crypto portfolio. If you need to stretch your mind to hold onto an investment, you should probably get out. Warren Buffett says invest in things you understand. You might understand how the LN works, but you do not seem to understand how money works. That is your fundamental flaw.

so..... you are going to hodl crypto, take an 80% loss, and then spend it on  a cup of overpriced sugar + coffee? 
Do you really think that this will push Bitcoin back to the highs??? god you guys are morons. 
definitely the hope and future... 
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:27:56
Sigh..... apples to oranges? you are totally clueless.... and heading to zero. popcorn ready. FYI, BTC is approaching $4K
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:03:09
Also, if your tech is so great, why do you feel the need to defend it so vigorously?? Why? because you know that the only way to prop this whole market up is shilling bS to even dumber people. 
It's not like you had to defend electric cars, light bulbs, credit cards, google, amazon, facebook. they just forge their way and not give a fuck. Bitcoin does not seem to have this strength. Bitcoin is accepted by nobody significant. Only drug dealers, pedos, and morons. 
And you plan to build an even more convoluted network on top of this??? im going to stick to assessment that you don't know what you're talking about. If you did, you would be out. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:56:15
Lol. You’re an idiot.

lol this is so true
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:51:31
do you even know how lightning works????? 
Using your gas  analogy, it's like saying, if i want to buy gas (use bitcoin), i would have to siphon off my neighbor's gasoline, who siphoned the gasoline from some random dude in Walmart, and tie up thousands of gallons (dollars) in gasoline contracts (LN nodes payment channels). Who in their right mind will tie their survival and hold BTC in a LN node when the price fluctuates like it has in the past few days??? 
You are either exceedingly stupid or sitting on a HUGE loss. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:05:46
causation without correlation. halving does not make the price go up if the float out there is still high and on the sell side.

Definition of a "Ponzi", or Pyramid scheme :


a form of investment (e.g. Nano)
in which each paying participants recruits two further participants (i.e. 2017)
with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones (i.e. whales and early birds cashing out in 2018 while the chumps hold the bags)
WTF does "HODL" have to do with whether this is a pyramid scheme or not? You only need Google, Wikipedia, and minimal common sense to see that most cryptos are obviously a Ponzi scheme.
Bitcoin *had* some utility value because it was supposed to be untraceable, which it is, until you cash out to dirty fiat. Even then, there are plenty of ways a motivated law enforcement official can track you down if you try to move any illicit coins into the real world.
The the other 1000+ cryptocurrencies are useless because nobody accepts them as a realistic alternative to fiat (Bitcoin). You cannot do anything with them except buy stickers, drugs, child pornography, ransomware, and relatively untraceable extortion.
You can do the whole [XMR.to]( and mixers to try and cover your tracks, but good luck explaining to the fiat exchange why you have all this Bitcoin, which is traceable to the Genesis block, including mixers.  Hell, you might end up getting dirty coins from a human trafficking ring and get in even deeper shit when you try to cash out anything.
Lastly, look at what the US did to Iraq (and doing to Iran). Once there is a threat to US dollar hegemony, the US government acts very quickly to snuff it out. Case in point, the Bitcoin transfer laws in the US. You cannot simply send Bitcoin to a person. You must have them fill out a tax form and go through more than a simple QR scan.
Despite what most HODLers think about the Federal Reserve and inflation, it is a part of our world. If the debt and inflation stops (it won't), the world economy would come screeching to a halt and there would be a revolt (The Dark Knight Rises type shit), and none of the ball-less, and vag-less politicians will ever jeopardize their tenure by stopping the gravy train.
So the politicians have two choices:
1. Let the world credit reset and default, collapsing governments, business, industry, civility, society, Internet, basic life needs, lose their cushy jobs and privileged positions
2. Print more money and kill anything that poses a threat
So obviously, it's option 2.
Cost of living 1965:
* Average Cost of new house $13,600.00
* Average Income per year $6,450.00
* Gas per Gallon 31 cents
* Average Cost of a new car $2,650.00
* Loaf of bread 21 cents
Nothing is going to change except our prices.

lol except you cannot. there are approximately 4000 LN nodes. there are over 30M places were Visa is accepted..... you're so sheep, i pity you.

wow, everybody here lost the context of my statement. the moron said you can use bitcoin every day because of LN. false. 
You run two nodes, huh? Two whole nodes? What did you buy? Blockstream stickers or steam credit. i bet you $1000, VISA will still be bigger than Bitcoin in 10 years.... LN is a joke.... the people who support it are idiot bagholders with no background in tech. probably you...
