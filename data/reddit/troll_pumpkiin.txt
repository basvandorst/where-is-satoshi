I won’t be staying here for too long. In UK there was tons of atm’s. Even in small city like Brighton. I just wanted to use freedom of bitcoin. I dont want to deal with banks and people. It feels really good to just cash out through atm and spend it...

Not using those services. Paypal is blocked in my country.

Do I have to meet someone ?

Bitcoin is digital gold, not digital money. Even litecoin is slow. I see those coins as emtia.
This is not a crypto currency sub but XRP and XLM would be better choice for steam.

Yeah, if it becomes fast and cheap, I'd love to use it.

Are you happy with 2 hours ? Lmao

I used bitcoin ATM and I hated it. I just transferred XRP to my wallet, took like 4 seconds, with like 0.0005 usd fee. Sorry but i prefer speed and cheap transactions. Right now bitcoin is the slowest coin. Sending money should be like sending message.

Thats a meme

Every number is ok except 1

Sad to hear. Why did you keep all in one exchange ? I always use at least 2 exchanges with equal balances.

If he is not a trader, I totally agree with you. Ledger Nano S costs $65. But if he is an active trader, it is best to use multipl exchanges.
