I'm not a charity project myself, but i'm looking for an hedge fund to become fulltime trader, as i'm suffering from anxiety i dropped out of school and can't go to work, atleast on the bright side i love to trade and spend time. In the future as i'm growing and having more money i will start a campaign to raise awarness for OCD/anxiety. If you still have Questions you can always DM me. I would appreciate it allot if you consider this. Gz Seppe

Well might be the wrong adress, but ive bought over 1btc, but i got the seed and tried on electrum, but its empty, its 0btc, that makes no sense since if i would have spended it, i would have leftovers.

i even got the screenshot i bought over 1btc in 2015 in pieces. Well i gues i got to face the loss, life is shitty, they even steal from the poor people, sick world.

 as you can see i bought a fair amount of it back in the day, i even needed to ask my mom to buy it since it was illegal for me. I got to be hacked or something then, still thanks for the time.

You should start an hedgefund for people without millions of money to start with, lets assume you give 500$ and if they double it in X time you give them X btc, not everyone has money to buy 1btc.
