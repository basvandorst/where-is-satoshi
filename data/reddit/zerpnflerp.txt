Indeed, I use 2FA for other logins elsewhere and even some requiring a PGP key. I love it and swear by it and am a dummy for not using it. If I had intended to hold my capital in that online wallet, I'd have used 2FA. Its my dang short term memory and bad habit of procrastination that let me forget about the small sum left in that wallet and leave it insecure.
Word to the wis: if you know your memory aint strong, you may NOT procrastinate 
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:00:11
Yes. Quite sure.
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:00:37
yes it was. Dang...
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:40:43
Ok thanks for the tip!
When possible I use a PGP key. Ive also used emails but was locked out of an account when that email provider suddenly shut down. 
When PGP is not an option, do you have a suggestion of a preferred method?
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:37:32
Indeed. I of course only blame my own dumb self for this. Just asking so i can do better next time :/

What I mean to say is how might I diagnose the extent of my systems issues? How might I know how deep this persons reach is into my system? And therefore what actions are necessary to resolve it and be safer in the future.

No it was generated in my password keeper. This is why I doubt that, and worry if it is a keylogging, then they have my master password, and from there, everything.....
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:40:38


This was my intention, and I will have to be more keen about acting on it in the future.


This is my main take away so far.

I guess I should go back to selling suspension bridges in the Arizona desert :p JK

I'm trying to look this up, bitcointalk has a terrible search function and its returning every result with the letter "r" in any post. So virtually everything on the site. Can you link to something about this or give me a quick breakdown of it? I'm trying to determine if i need to completely reinstall my OS and software. Thank you
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:01:18
Anything I can do to diagnose that?
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:32:53
Thank you I will include your suggestions in my research :)
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:05:48
I was not. 
It was meant to be a temporary and intermediary wallet that I sorta forgot about having any sum left. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:29:44
I understand how you could infer that, but realistically, server hosting is not a lot of money, and a cost I already bare. I don't want to sound like a big shot or anything, but my business can afford a few dozen a month to host it. Its not the cost I was trying to avoid :p
It truly was the perpetuity, and exploring the concept of enhancing trust, albeit misguided.
Regardless, the sum of feedback seems to prove it unfeasable, so I will continue to explore other options.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:27:48
Exactly the conclusion I came to from your first comment. I guess my concern with using a sql database is, while I take great care in my IT and associated infrastructure, its not as safe for posterity as a public ledger with signs of perpetuity. I guess I was looking for a way to utilize the trustless nature of the blockchain to ironically add trust to the inherently trust-reliant nature of share ownership.
Thank you very much for the delicious food for thought!
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:46:11
Ok great. Some more food for thought. I will include these cases in my research. Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:41:40
Thanks for the input This is along my lines of thinking, I'm just not as concise as you. Your comment gave me a thought: Not realistically interested in this option beyond theory, but here goes......
What if one creates an altcoin, and uses blockchain technology, but not the bitcoin blockchain? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I were to create an altcoin, it would act as its own ledger? Seperate from the bitcoin Blockchain?
Again, mostly wondering about theory and concept in this context, I dont realistically seeing myself invest effort in an altcoin.

I'll take 0.5% royalties for the idea! lol jk.
Neat to know i'm in good company with this thought process. What stage are you at of this process?
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:50:11
I would like to be in a position to support the growing number of local businesses that accept BTC.
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:47:10
and Your back and forth was very informative in itself :)
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:00:34
Dang..... Ok thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:00:31
Hmm ok thanks. I'm trying to determine how compromised my system is since I will want to replace them at a strategic time.
Not a large sum, but that was the last of the $12 I was gifted back when it was about $50CAD/btc. I wont see that kind of ROI again :/
@_date: 2017-02-17 02:09:58
Thank you I agree with your suggestions. Its how I hold my normal bitcoin capital. This was a small amount left over from a transfer I never quite finished. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:19:33
Thank you. I am updating my virus protection model and if this is the case hope to weed it out. Do you think its safe to say this system is compromised and I should not be using it to buy and store my future bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:18:23
Great insight! That makes a lot of sense. 
I hadn't considered miners fees inevitably rising due to the perpetual reduction of miners' rewards. I guess I was mostly interested in it as a fund raising effort (duh lol) but thought it could be marketable to the niche of: "where can I spend my bitcoins?"
Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:32:30
Thank you. This was concise and informative. I will research the Lykkex model as a case study, on top of my other alternative avenues.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:57:54
If you don't mind, I'd like to follow up with you in PM after a given amount of time to see how you're finding the process. Do you have a determined timeline, that I can use to measure when to bother you next about this after your next step?
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:20:28
This was my other question that I unfortunately forgot to include in my original post. Any issues with legality, compliance, etc. 
Thanks for the note!

Can I please cut you in line at the bank? My reasons for depositing/withdrawing are more important than yours.
