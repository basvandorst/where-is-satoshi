Thanks for the reply. The 4th address on that list ending in “7Mm” is my receiving output address for both transfers. No BCH for me... little discouraged now though because I did the full resync but still seeing a shortage of btc in my wallet. Perhaps I’ll try deleting and then recovering the wallet? I also emailed breadwallet support staff but I’m not sure what else to do.

Is this what you're referring to? Sorry, I'm a crypto noob. 
On a side note, i've done a bit of research and other users appear to be having the same issue. A potential solution (in which I'm trying right now) is to "Sync with the blockchain" through the app. 
On their support section of the website it indicates to re-sync with the blockchain "If someone sent you money and it shows as confirmed in the blockchain yet it is not appearing in your wallet, your wallet may be out of sync. First check to make sure the address the money was sent to is correct."

Sorry what do you mean restoring on another device? What are the implications of restoring it on my current phone vs. another device? I have enough BTC in my wallet to make a grown man cry

Re-sync ended up working... thank you for your responses and advice

does this help? It indicates that there is 0 pending balance but I never received the ".0794" portion... so strange.
