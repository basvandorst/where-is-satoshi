I remember I was credited a certain amount of btc...I just took it for granted that it was the number they stated. It could have been 2,3-5 for all I know. It's just a weird/ tough spot all together.
 "Coinbase "accidentally" credit him with &gt;4 BTC"  I don't even think you can get funded with BTC w/o it being cleared by the bank (takes about a week), I never ever even tried to buy that much coin. I came on here and a lot of people were having glitchy probs with coinbase at that same time months ago... Idk... Aarrrgghhhhhhh

Well, thanks for the idiot remark... I sure hope it's a scam ...and NO I did not give any information out. Except my PW, SS# and mother's maiden name...but they asked for it...so I guess I had to

That is good to know..So they were told that they "defrauded" Coinbase and needed to reopen their account? Or at least something very similar?

Getting a bit frustrated, though you guy's sentiments towards it being a scam is giving me a bit of encouragment...Thanks everyone!

I am not a brand new user... I just made a throw-a-way for this post...I have personal info on my regular account and it would be just -ev for me to use my normal account...no harm/no foul in throwaway.. =) 
I have screenshots of the emails...why in the world would I make this up?
I just came here to get some advice/help from people in r/bitcoin. Everyone seems like a friendly bunch willing to 
help. Thanks..

I deleted that account a while back, they wanted me to restore that account to stay in good standing. So yes, there was a restore your account button...
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:53:41
Yes, if it came down to it I have proof. I just don't want to open up my account again, especially through the link they provided. I have heard of some phishing scams, not sure if this could be one...
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:05:21
Could you explain how to do this? I am not aware, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:56:06
oh yea, duh. Thanks!

Yea, I think that is what it might come down to. I just think it is a shitty situation to have to deal with. It's like someone leaving $100 bill in your mailbox...you go spend that $100, then the person who made the mistake tries to sue you for an exceedingly more expensive amount. No bueno

@_date: 2013-11-16 04:19:23
When I open email I do not see any " actions" part nor message source? Damn.. I really am trying I just cant seem to figure this out... none of the directions are working. =(
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:24:13
It just doesnt work with outlook. impoosssibbruuu ..THanks though man!
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:02:55
You think so? What makes you think that? I would be very happy if it were a scam because it's putting a lot of stress on me.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:01:55
Keep in mind I didn't even but ONE coin...let a lone FOUR...and it was quite a bit of time after I purchased my first share of BTC that this random credit of four coins was added to my account.
