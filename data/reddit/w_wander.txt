Care to elaborate? 
Was it a Cryptocurrency related job? What did you learn from that interview that made you come out ahead on the next one, if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:21:59
Crypto-life failures! Basically. 
I'm not looking for any advice, just telling stories, sharing failures and how people made them into successes in life. Its story telling, sharing + learning mixed together.
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:58:50
No, I'm seeking a larger group then the singular for response.
Some people may have had failures involving other coins. Im using the phrase Cryptocurrency to invite responses from all of the industry. Involving others for more information and discussion on the subject. More information converts to more knowledge
@_date: 2019-02-02 14:03:23
What would you say you gained form this experience? 
Going forward, how would you treat a similar occurrence, maybe in a different market or opportunity, differently?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:52:01
No one care to give thought to the situation? Any users having issues with crypto at this time?
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:43:11
Im not sure i understand this response, care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:55:20
Why does this make you afraid? How would it affect you if you did not get enough? Why?
What to you is "enough"? And What if you do get enough, what happens then? What are your goals, what do you hope to achieve? Why?
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:01:06
Ah, i like this one. So in your response you said you have no worries, but then mentioned you trust that "if" it is sound. So would that not be a concern of yours? Concerned that the whole concept of cryptocurrency is sound, censorship resistant and anti fragile "as people say"?  I may be incorrect, please explain for me i wish to understand, but the, as people say and If definitely seems to point to that you're not entirely confident in these things at this time? If so why, what is it about those things that would make you not feel worried? And if crypto isn't these things, then what would you feel, what would concern you? Why?
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:49:56
No, just questions about users fears and pain points in the current industry, feel free to answer as you choose or do not if you don't wish to its okay. One wouldn't get particular insight into things much without asking others about their mindset/thoughts on the situation so thats merely all i am doing. Thank you for your time
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:19:27
What are your goals to achieve with crypto? Why do you want to achieve those goals, what do you hope to achieve? 
What do you think is currently stopping you from  achieving these goals? Anything in your way? Why?
Do you struggle to understand anything in regards to crypto? What were/are your biggest roadblocks and pain points?
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:15:10
Great answer thanks! This is the general preconception i had on what most users would look like, the other answers are great too because they show not all are how i previously thought. Also, interests and activities/hobbies are different, it wasn't a repeated question but can be answered the same if you choose
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:51:29
Was this comment meant to be sarcastic? I have an honest interest in what people hope to achieve with cryptocurrencies, i understand a lot of users may say acquire more bitcoin, which translates to earn more money.
 i'm interested to learn what drives most people here and what goals they have in regards to crypto legitimately, to know what people use crypto for or hope to be able to use it for or see happen with it.  But thank you for your comment either way
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:53:29
Would you care to expand on this? When you say aquire more bitcoin, my assumption is this translates to earn more $, do you have any direct goals in relation to this? Why crypto specifically if your goal is to aquire more money, what draws you to the crypto market for this?
Can you say besides earning more income that you may have any other hope or dreams for or in regards to this market?
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:38:02
No need for defensiveness, as i said in the posting, i'm just curious to find where people make purchases, maybe find some new places to share with others. Thanks for your response anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:38:42
As I said it's not specifically for me,  i'm gathering research for the assistance of other beginners and new users,  besides the info that I already have, to see what other critical and highly informative  sources there can be for them. Thank you for this link. It is a very large source, that's great. 
 Out of all the links in here, what would you say was one of the most informative,  or vital pieces, specifically to you?
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:38:22
Wrong sub it what way. It's a Bitcoin sub is it not? I'm looking for those who have skill in editing and knowledge about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.
Also, if you read my post, you will find I clearly say quality pay will be given. There's absolutely no begging implied here, we are funded and fully capable of paying adequate rates.
This is a professional inquiry, not a starving post for free work. Posted in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies related threads for relevant writers and editors.
But thanks for your reply anyways.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:14:15
So whats your favorite place to shop with cryptocurrencies? What do you usually like to get with your cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:17:57
Feel free to post any type of thoughts you may have even if they're not direct answers, just general thoughts, i'm interested to hear what the community thinks!
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:49:16
Care to explain what this is?

Care to explain what this is?
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:16:08
So in what ways do you use cryptocurrency for freedom if I may ask? Whats your primary purchase spot and which cryptocurrency is it that you use most for purchasing?
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:52:36
Out of all the resources you cited, If you had to select only one,  what specific video/article/ podcast episode would you choose as the most impactful single piece of information for you personally? 
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:30:51
Do you feel that because user experience and design isn't up to par its preventing more users from adopting crypto?
Did you or anyone you know struggle learning crypto and utilizing it due to this \^problem? 
What was most difficult for you to learn or figure out how to do when you were first learning about crypto? Why was this an issue and did you know others that had the same issues? How did you solve those problems in the past? 
What do you think is the hardest learning curve, or biggest struggle for new users ?
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:15:04
So you make all purchases in cryptocurrencies? Thats very interesting, where would you say is your favorite place to shop? Or maybe the most useful place for you to get your purchasing done? Which cryptocurrency do you use most to transact with?
@_date: 2019-01-28 16:44:24
Thanks! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:46:30
Sorry for you to have perceived my question as such, i did not direct anyone how to answer my questions, merely out of expectation that a lot of people may just say their concerned about it going to $0, i gave further guidelines in which that answer can be expanded upon. Rather then me just getting goes to $0 and i'm broke answers, because that wouldn't exactly give me the insight i was seeking into users worries and fears with my questions, the expanded upon version would have. Also, no one forced you to answer the question, so while i thank you for your time there was no being told or forced into anything here, sorry you perceived my questions as such. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:39:19
Well I did also mention what types of purchases and where. Just trying to get some indications on how users like to spend their cryptocurrencies. Maybe then describe to me your point, how you personally use it for freedom?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:36:59
So in regards to this comment what would you say your goal is? 
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:42:40
Is making purchases with bitcoin your primary use of the coin? Do you usually have issues making purchases? 
What makes that a struggle for you? Does anyone else you know struggle with these issues or are their problems with crypto something different? 
What type of things do you wish you had when you first began learning about crypto? What do you think would have made your learning curve quicker, easier? Such as, what did you wish existed or you could have had when you began entering the crypto space to make your learning process better, more complete or quicker?  
What was hard about your beginning learning experience in crypto? Which parts and why?
