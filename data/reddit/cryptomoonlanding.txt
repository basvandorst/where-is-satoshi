That the tether scam got a lot scammier.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:38:49
LOL you want to come teaching me why the price isn’t inflated by fake tether printing. �� I did my research, lots of it. There is no burning of tether, however there is lots of printing and buying BTC with it using unbacked tokens to then dump on fiat exchanges. Some tether is also loaned out to large ‘clients’ and paid back after a pump and dump has been competed.
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:51:38
Only if you can get enough people to believe it. Can’t remember the name for that kind of action.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:55:20
My local supermarket or my gas station don’t quite prices in bitcoin. That’s what’s keeping it from being used as a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:20:32
How about ‘Usable’? And ‘Not inflated by fake tether’? See the problem is almost nobody gives a damn about bitcoin, if not with the purpose of selling it to the next holder for more fiat. 
All the fundamentals of bitcoin can be copied and reproduced, not a single part of it makes bitcoin unique, just its first mover advantage makes it somehow recognised right now. 
Any government could make a digital coin with its same properties and mine that.

Gullibility Over 9000. 
LOL The bank manager. Ahahhaha My dog can sign better than that forgery. 
How about they get audited by a real top class auditing company? Ohhhhh....right....they have no funds and tether is backed by bitcoin and not by dollars, of which they don’t have 4billions in the bank, that’s why they don’t do it. 
They haven’t lost 850m dollars and are now pumping and dumping with free tether to make that back. Sure not. 
Your mental gymnastic is actually pathetic.
Oh, right, I forgot the letter by their own attorney. Ahahahah
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:50:10
Yeah much more believable. 
You see this whole thing wrong with the hope of getting rich quick, it doesn’t matter if the supply decreases if there isn’t constantly increasing demand, and right now there’s little demand for 10k bitcoin, unless you can buy with the free fake money called tether. 
If you wouldn’t pay 100k for a bitcoin, don’t expect somebody else to take it off your hands for 100k. Simple as that.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:53:28
I am at not paying so much for an asset inflated by the tether printer. Maybe if it corrects a lot more. If not I’ll stick to what I have.

Oh yeah? And what is going to support the price after that spike up? 
If tether is busted, whose dollars orders would be on Bitstamp or Coinbase for you to cash out the bitcoin pumped by those people dropping tether?
Whose bitcoins will be on sell order books on tether pairs for people to dump their tether?
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:13:21

@_date: 2019-07-22 14:55:18
As long as they are constantly audited and transparent I see no problem with stablecoins. 
I see a problem with tether printed out of thin air to pump and dump bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:38:25
Google it bro. You’ll understand why bitcoin needs constant shilling from people, instead of being quiet and buying. You can’t profit if nobody else is buying higher. It’s not about holding it, it’s about somebody else buying at higher prices or the whole game won’t work anymore. So it’s very much like the way in which religious institutions get new followers, by showing their version of the truth and convincing them it is the only truth. 
Of course it isn’t cheap right now, tether’s been printing fake money to inflate it for six months and counting.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:19:36

Your risk at these prices is astronomical. Also learn about how Bitcoin’s price is being inflated by fake money (tether) and wait for it to be a lot cheaper, and it will. Its value can go up only is somebody else is buying at higher prices, so your entry price is very very very important. Buying now with real money is dangerous, at best.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:56:33
Pretty much.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:32:19

Welcome to the 2019 fake tether printing scam.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:10:40
I already told you. Start from NYAG court documents, thetetherreport, the Liberty reserve case and more. There’s plenty to show tether is inflating prices to dump for fiat.

Well of course, till tether is there buying with fake dollars, this isn’t gonna fly at all.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:15:07
Can’t Revolut open an exchange and allow in-app trading so that money goes directly to our bank account and can be withdrawn from ATMs, moved, stored in account and so on?
Now that would be revolutionary...
Why not?
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:04:25
Yes, there is. Lots, and by their own admissions. Something about not being profitable without investing into unspecified assets, e.g. bitcoin, instead of holding reserves. Meaning bitcoin is inflated by both tether itself and the tether they have given out, for cash but also just loaned to pump and dump, and be paid back. 
I know, at first it can be daunting to understand the process but if you spend some time on the myriad of evidence, it becomes clear. 
You can start by reading up on the details of the NYAG documents, not some random summary news report.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:17:04
I look at google search, it’s falling fast since weeks. 
Followers of the bitcoin Reddit can easily be done and faked by the very same holders. 
Either way,  you go dupe your relatives into buying at these prices, I will not.
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:35:22
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:57:32
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:53:22
Well, yes, kind of. They need 1 real dollar for every tether issued, held in fiat in a bank, not in assets like BTC.
If that’s the case and we can see proof by an renowned, diligent international auditing firm, and all documents subpoenaed by the NYAG, then it means somebody gave billions of dollars to buy tokens from a shady company investigated by the US government and who lost 850m and banking multiple times, including facing a 100k+ bitcoins hack, which could have been an inside job. 
Though they failed to submit the documents required yet again, and the NYAG has been given three more months to investigate further.
The rabbit hole goes deep, just don’t ignore it, yet if you can ride the wave, just hope for the best and don’t be the last one to take profits.

���� Yeah, no. Go out preaching like a Jehovah’s Witness if you want to, I am not putting friends and family at risk, I don’t care about the charts, I am not a missionary trying to save others, I mind my own business and they can do the same.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:09:31
lol Banks are regulated and don’t print money to inflate bitcoin and cash out. Really? You want to make the bank argument? �� We are at being apologetic for Tether’s criminal activity just because numbers might go up? 
Sad and ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:09:03
The talk here is tether printing to pump and dump bitcoin, and inflate prices. That is a criminal activity by a shady, unvetted, unaudited entity. 
Discussion about banks is not what matters here. 
Plenty of evidence, start by reading the NYAG court documents.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:09:02
Sure it will. ��
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:08:14
Just like any good religious cult, the adepts get tired of different opinions.
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:57:07
No, there isn’t any. As you can see from the ever increasing supply, nobody ever redeems tether for fiat. 
Why would they? That can just buy BTC and sell for fiat on other exchanges. It’s a scam, and it’ll end up just like Liberty Reserve. 
Just show me an audit done by an independent firm attesting that they have 4b dollars in the bank.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:17:56

DYOR. I am not here to research stuff and post it for you. I expressed my opinion and know what I talk about.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:58:54
Sure not. Maybe just ask why tether is never redeemed and its supply never goes down and why we can’t see accounts of their usd holdings, which should be around 4b liquid dollars. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:48:50
It’s coming. The case is being built. Look at Liberty Reserve. I am confident of what I am saying. Price is inflated by unbacked tethers.

Because they are not responsible for pumping my bags, and I wouldn’t want friends and family loosing money into something this risky, especially with fake tethers around. Hell if I could buy by just printing some, ok, but I won’t convince anybody to get in and then run away with their money like a crook.

If tether prints fake money it’ll go up. If not, it’ll go down as they cash out for real dollars.

Up to your risk tolerance. It can still go higher. It can go down 90%. You know the drill.

See a doctor if you think buying now is a good idea. Your risk/reward would give a heart attack to anybody but those who tell you to buy because they want to offload.

There’s too much to link it here. 
Start from articles like this to see what is going on. 
See what happened to Liberty Reserve back in the days. 
Follow 
Search for ‘bitfinex NYAG’ on Twitter. 
See how tether is never redeemed, only printed. And nobody knows if it is even 1% backed by dollars or if they print it/loan it to inflate the price and such dollars out, since they refuse to provide the documents already subpoenaed. 
Watch this and see what you think. 
It’s complex and you won’t have a definitive answer until it pops.
Just don’t funnel in anymore fiat at these prices because something will have to give at some point.

Year their inside job is called a hack now. ��
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:13:26
Use another legit stablecoin. Tether is not backed by anything, it’s printed to inflate bitcoin and profit from pumps and dumps, and it will fail. The only question is when. If you don’t believe it look at the Liberty Reserve case on Wikipedia.
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:49:13
Stop Tether and its inflow of fake tokens. Then we’ll know the real price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:51:12
Get a grip of reality and prices. Think about a nice house worth 300k and now think somebody giving it to you for a Bitcoin in a year or two. 
Then think of it again. And again. 
Then think you are the one giving a 300k home for a digital coin, and maybe then you’ll get why it’s nowhere near to happening soon.

Tether Volume VS USD
Tether Velocity, indicating wash trading on exchanges back and forth to push prices up, trying to catch people putting in real money, before cashing out and reducing tether supply. 
This shows how 30b usdt volume in tether moves between hands 10 times a day. Why?
No interest on googletrend. Only Tether. 
Tether print predicting bitcoin price movements. 
The list goes on, there’s more.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:28:18
Exactly what will happen when people try to cash out an asset inflated by tether and not real money.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:27:57
I am saying the risk/reward is insane now. Parabolic moves end in crushes. If you can handle it, put your money into an unregulated asset that went up 300+% in weeks, at the same time that tether printed 1.5+ billion dollar tokens out of thin air and without the shadow of a proof that those are backed by real dollars. 
It is highly manipulated. The risk becomes higher the more the price goes up, if you can take the risk, go for it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:51:34
Millionaires don’t give a damn about your get rich quick scheme. 
Buyers are waiting? LOL I can’t even discuss this with such delusional people. It’s you who is waiting for an ETF that will not come because you want bitcoin to gain in value, pump your bags and sell it to the next buyer in line. 
There is almost no dollar volume on bitcoin right now, it’s all unbacked tether pushing prices up. I am sure millionaires are in line to get scammed by a fraudulent company and SEC will authorise people to put their pensions in it so that Bitfinex can sell them bitcoin at inflated prices.
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:22:56

You have no proof. Show me the audits. Tether has no backing.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:38:11
If it doesn’t go down soon, it’s a bulltrap and will go down sooner or later, nothing goes up like this forever and most indicators are topped out already, meaning the price is speculation only right now, not real value, it’s based on sentiment and sentiment will change. Buy into fear, not greed, or buy now and be prepared to see lower prices and hold through them. 
If it doesn’t test the 21 weekly MA and starts creating a long term uptrend, it’s also a trap. 
Plus, tether volume has outstripped dollars volume by a lot, which leads many to believe tether has just been printing tokens to inflate the price and buy bitcoin so that they can cover the 850m dollars hole in their books by selling the bitcoin they bought with fake money.
There is no transparency over what they are doing apart from printing 1.6 billion fake dollars in 3 months. 
Google trend also shows no increased interest and institutions surely don’t go via tether or buy on weekends. Have you seen the weekend pumps? That is big sign of manipulation and something shady going on. 
Can it go to 12-13-15k? Maybe, can it stay there? Not a chance. Risk/reward now is bad, and dangerous to buy, but if you can stand it going to 6k or lower, or have money to buy more even if it goes to 3k or 2k, then go for it. 
When everybody is bullish you don’t have to buy, especially with real dollars while the market and the price is being driven by tether volume, which we won’t know if it’s backed or otherwise, and exchanges wash trading. 
Do your own research, of course. Just don’t think is a sure thing or everybody would be rich.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:28:09
Don’t buy at these levels.

By the look of it, I’d expect the lowest we land when it’s all said and done will be the 400 weekly MA. But, it could retest and hold the 200 WMA. 
This uptrend is tether and wash trading exchanges trying to milk it further. 
This price level should have been reached only few weeks before the halvenig next year, it is now around 45 weeks ahead of the 2015 price comparative. Plenty of time for it to go down, find a base and slowly move up in a more sensible uptrend.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:49:15

Are you joking, right? The whole market is in the hands of tether printing unbacked dollars, mtgox has 160k bitcoins and nothing has been decided on whether they’ll be sold or given to people who on average paid 400 dollars for them, miners are mostly in China and get thousands of bitcoins a day, and you even remotely think an ETF will be approved?
The pressure is growing on the SEC? What? Lol

Nope, that is causation until I see tether holding a dollar in the bank for each tether being issued.
