It's not like gold or artwork bc those are both tangible entities. I'll agree it does have a demand but its because it presented as some new age technological driven currency. IMO the public will not buy into this ever bc the premise behind Bitcoins is so complicated it could easily be used as scam bait. Someone could claim that this fancy crypto currency translate into this outer space currency and soon enough we're dancing around in the land of make believe. US currency is simply printed by a federal regulated mint. The bills have counterfeit measures and are established non subjective (like artwork) forms of currency. You know what I'm going to skip how the Federal Reserve also helps legitimize the dollar and I'm just going to agree with you 100%. You are completely correct that Bitcoins are like artwork. They have a totally subjective value inherent to each individual. If you want to believe Bitcoins have a value go for it, but just be careful trying to translate that into actual objective value

Lol, I didn't buy. Good one though hahaha

Yeah np. You seem nice so I'd recommend doing some counter research if you know what I mean. How could Bitcoin not work. Everyone on here is trying to come up with any reason Bitcoin isn't BS. The most prevalent one is that it's somehow like the US dollar. I agree I've wondered how the US dollar works and even it sounds like sometimes. But there's a lot to it. I'd just recommend comparing what the US dollar has that legitimizes it that Bitcoin doesn't. Also I'd look into previous crashes of hyped commodities. Like the US left the gold standard in the 80s, so how's gold doing now? Note that the gold standard is still used in some countries btw. Also just please remember that Bitcoin are literally intangible and idk about you but that is not a good feature to me. I have no clue how Bitcoin works and for all I know some dude could code some more Bitcoins or hack them or something. I just like to think I have common sense and Bitcoin just sounds like a whole load of BS to me lol. We know alchemy is not a thing so golds safe lol. Nobody's hacking that. The federal reserve has counterfeit measures and takes care in how much bills they print. Anyway yeah, good luck to ya

Sorry I didn't post positive affirmation. You do realize that everyone that everyone that has bitcoins want the value to go up and then jump ship right? The only reason there's so many confirming posts is the more unkind of us don't want you to sell because it drives the Bitcoin price, and their price, down. Some people suck so watch out lol

Dude a pdf from Bitcoins own website is the least likely place to find evidence it's not a scam. Of course they're going to say it's legitimate

I'm just hear to warn about a reality that will come around sooner or later. There are good people getting fucked by this Bitcoin scam and I'd rather not have more do the same tbh. The speculators and scammers can have a field day amongst themselves tho, idc

Dude EtherDelta, one of these great cryptocurrencies, literally just got hacked this week. They are lines of code in a server dude, they are changeable
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:36:00
Just a few, if people have their kids college fund or money for food in Bitcoin they could very well lose it. Just trying to help tbh

What? I'm not laughing at anyone who lost life affecting money to Bitcoin. I'm sorry if I came across that way. I'm no expert and maybe I'm wrong but Bitcoin has all the signs of a bad investment put forth as a good one by those seeking to make money off of others. I'm trying to help other people not lose money to Bitcoin. Again, my apologies if somebody took a big hit this "minor crash" or w/e Bitcoiners are chalking it up as that is terrible and I hope you figure it out. Just to help if you lost money to Bitcoin take everything you read in this subreddit with a grain of salt. 
Bitcoin only gains value from more people buying into it. Everyone that has bitcoins wants the value to go up so they're going to attempt to disregard every crash. If you sell, the price goes down and they lose money. These dudes post basically BS posts trying to color Bitcoin as any sort of anything besides BS. They are just trying to get enough people to buy so they can jump ship into high tides of profit. They could give 2 shits if it crashes afterward

4/10 not winding or long enough of answer. If you used more meaningless large words and threw in some more random numbers I could maybe get you up to a 5/10 but that's it sorry

How can Bitcoin not be transferred instantly if you agree it's a digital currency? Ex: Digital transfer between bank accounts in Venmo. 
The dude I replied to referenced there being some load that the Bitcoin can't sustain. I was just referencing that unlike the US dollar, Bitcoin has no overhead (but also no regulatory agencies). So how could it be overloaded? Also my apologies I got like 9000 billion replies to my non affirming Bitcoin comments so I'm kind of burnt on replying right now lol

You guys do realize this is a fake currency that only exists because people put money in it. Once people start mass selling it will crash into pretty much nothing. Bitcoins contain no actual inherent value besides being "fancy technological internet coins." Please explain Bitcoins to me and then tell me it's not a scam. Just trying to help, if you have significantly life affecting amounts of money in Bitcoin I'd recommend selling

Oh yeah 100% I don't know how it functions. I'm no genius but I tried reading into Bitcoin and it still makes no sense. I cant code but I've got an intermediate knowledge of computers. Idk dude I'm just going by if it sounds like BS, looks like BS, and is perpetuated by people who have something to gain like BS, it just might be BS. Like technically if you got everyone you knew to buy the fairly limited supply Bitcoin the price would have to go up. And in a sense you would make money. But there would be no creation of actual value so that's why I think, IMO, it crashes a lot. It's just the flow of more people buying and then dudes selling, no actual value progression.
So yeah last post but In my defense I feel like I have some understanding of the economics behind Bitcoin yet I'm trying to help and asking people to sell after pointing out the faults. Just a heads up, unfortunate reality, but some other people definitely understand the faults I'm pointing out but are asking you to buy anyway... So yeah watch out for those guys please 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:23
Lol dude idk, I wish the US currency was as solid as Bitcoins. If dollars were mined like gold in magical internet mines man oh man would it be nice. And dude all the Bitcoin regulatory agencies have got it down pat. Dude and its like universally accepted, I wish the US dollar could do that. I'm going to take a loan out against my family's home to get into this new age internet money fountain brb

Guys don't invest in cryptocurrencies claimed to be quantum backed this or hyper supported this. As well how could a decentralized currency ever be a good thing? If there is no sense of actual support to a currency we'd be back to trading and bartering real quickly. My recommendation: Invest in yourself. No board of self interested perpetuators of groundless crypto currency can take your own skills away from you. They can take your money though

What load? It's literally digital, can be transfered instantly and has no overhead from those "pesky" governmental regulatory agencies that try to bring legitimacy to a currency
