How many transactions are done with the Bitcoin Core wallet, you could make the same argument.

Viruses patch their own DNA into cells and hijack their function into making more virus. Viruses are actually really simple things, they practically aren't even alive, they are literally just a shell and a mechanism for injecting DNA code once they hit a cell. They are far more simple than something like a bacterium which actually is a living thing. You might even think of a virus as just a 'code egg' that hatches inside a cell and the actual life of the virus is inside the cell.
Viruses don't take code out of cells they infect and then inject it into other species. Viruses tend to be very species specific. 
Let's say you want to take a specific gene out of tobacco and put it into a rabbit. You need something like CRISPR to do that.
Now, previously it was a bit of a crap-shoot, because there was no way to target where CRISPR would insert the gene into the target genome. This led to large numbers of cells turning cancerous or otherwise becoming defective.
But now there is a way to use CRISPR that targets where to place the gene as well, so that these kinds of failures will not happen.
And as I previously said, one application for this is to do things like produce a specific protein like the heroin opioid, and produce it in something like yeast that is easy to grow.

Some researchers figured out that you can make yeast produce pure heroin, but they wouldn't release the gene pathway.
Let's see how long that lasts.
Also, the Tasp exists in real life, my brother in law knows the guy who invented and tried it out in clinical settings, and has a story about the first time the machine hit the brain's pleasure center inducing heroin-like pleasure without any chemicals. The Tasp can replace all chemical recreational drugs. That wasn't the purpose of the device, which was to activate specific brain regions and record their purpose, but it turned out to work that way.

The problem with the 'insider trading' argument is that it assumes that it's obvious in advance whether the price would go up or down. 
Just because we see what the price has done does not mean it could be easily correctly called in advance. After all, many here predicted that once Coinbase opened its stores that the other coin would drop in price massively from people selling it.
They could just as easily have traded on the expectation of a falling price by shorting the coin.
I find the arguments against insider trading to be spurious in general, insider trading should be completely legalized, even for the stock market.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:38:47

Only from addresses that have spent from once. A never-spent address is still quantum safe. And bitcoin is setup to use new addresses every time, in the ref client anyway, via change addresses, minimizing or eliminating reuse.
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:27:07
This has been address. It would take them years, cost billions, and while they're at it would take about an hour of code to blacklist those machines and their fork for about $300 cost in time.
That kind of asymmetric response available to the bitcoiners means it will likely never be attempted.
@_date: 2015-12-21 05:52:12
If anything this report shows that that kind of attack would not be their first choice. They'd go for subversion and propaganda.
@_date: 2015-12-12 09:51:09
Not likely.
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:35:14


We don't know this even exists. Claims aren't proof.
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:16:17
Apparently, see further down that thread. Messages that have never been sent from or signed from only expose the hash, not the pubaddress. Thus, quantum safe. Only by having an output from that address do you expose enough info for a quantum system to find the true address.

I'd believe that he mined early and may even have a sizeable fund--not 1.1m though, but I doubt he's Satoshi.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:53:32
@_date: 2015-12-22 03:42:37
And about two hours of dev time to blacklist an attacker's blockchain and push out an update nullifying the years and billions spent to perform that kind of attack.
@_date: 2015-12-10 06:27:46
Something about pedophilia normalization badly photoshopped onto Dorian's OP photo :|
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:34:39
Yes, they are.
All addresses never spent from are quantum-safe.
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:48:06
Again, it would take them about 2 years to put together such an effort, and cost most likely billions of dollars.
After its done they could create their own chain, but no one else would respect it, and the devs could blacklist their chain by pushing an update that would take about two hours to make and deploy and cost probably $300. 
When there's that much asynchronicity available in terms of action and response, there's no point in them doing that at all.
We are not defenseless to that attack.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:05:27


He stopped because of Wikileaks adopting bitcoin for donations, which would've brought government attention.
Government attention would've brought govhat-hackers trying to figure out who Satoshi is using their secret Tor-breaking techniques. It would've only been a matter of time at that point had he kept up the communication.
Being then unable to continue contributing often as he had been, he probably felt it better and safer to walk away entirely. Retraining anonymity would demand nothing less.
For someone so concerned about remaining anonymous, the way this guy has been leaked out seems atypical.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:54:50
Fair enough. Did he have this supercomputer back then though? It seems more recent.

This is why, you're protected by an incredibly large number; so large that computers getting faster does virtually nothing to help them crack your key:
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:52
Bad move.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:22:44


Doesn't that mean Satoshi's key will eventually be cracked and exploited. I'm sure there are people working on doing this now. Whomever cracks his key can effectively masquerade as him :(
No, even his key is not enough. You'd have to sign a message from one of his known bitcoin addresses that have never been spent from. Those are also quantum-secure encryption that no one's going to just crack any time soon.

I thought you were talking about bitcoin; you're talking about the dollar? There is no possible inflation policy for bitcoin. You're talking about bitcoin as seen through the lens of a hyper-inflating dollar.

@_date: 2015-12-09 01:20:36
If it turns out he really is Satoshi, he may need to spend some coins to provide the security he'll need now. For a guy who loves his privacy, coming out as Satoshi sounds like a bad idea.

If he was Satoshi and wanted to remain involved in the community under another identity but also not be found, he'd have a much better cover story for how long he's been involved in bitcoin and the like.
This supposed Satoshi certainly has a vastly different attitude towards his own personal privacy than the real Satoshi.
We would need to hear a compelling reason for why he's essentially allowed himself to be found. And then we need absolute proof in the form of a signed message by a key known to be Satoshi's.
Nothing less than that can serve as the ultimate proof. There will always, always be doubt until that is done, because it is the only act with which there can be no doubt. Only the real Satoshi, or someone connected to him in the real world, can sign a message with Satoshi's keys.

It's about punishing anyone who dares to harm state interests. In the world today, the state's most powerful ability is the ability to print its own money. By having only state-controlled fiat currencies, every state is able to plunder its populace with no relief-valve for frustrated and abused citizens.
Bitcoin created a relief valve.
Even if attacking Satoshi failed to find anyway to stop bitcoin, it would serve as a warning for others who might try to take the state on.
These people are vindictive and own the organs of law, thus they are above the law quite literally.

All pre 2012 that were mined and left in their mining address. Not all pre 2012 address.


Who knows for sure, but it could be in linear time. Potentially minutes or less.
They wouldn't give you warning. They would find every key they can attack from back then, crack all of them at the same time until they'd gotten every key, while nervously watching the transactions broadcasts and if they saw a dump of transactions in these old coins they'd immediately release their prepared list of all the wallets they'd already cracked themselves to try to get as many as possible in the next block. But more than likely they'd be able to get them all before anyone else had a chance to spoil.

I was ignoring that Visa is only one of several transaction processors, not to mention another multiple of non-credit transactions taking place all the time, ie: cash and the like.

VCs (virtual currencies) are an increasingly technologically feasible tool for non-state actors
to deploy; efforts to destabilize confidence in a new VC are effective,
while popular sentiment is still untrusting of VCs for common transactions;
VCs are just like any other service in cyberspace, and methods
to successfully attack them are not meaningfully different than for any
other cyberspace operation; decentralization affords more, though not
total, resilience to disruptions from cyber attacks; and finally, the trend
toward decentralized cyber service will only make it easier for unsophisticated
cyber actors to have increasingly resilient access to cyber

Well a couple reasons. 
For one thing, I include ocean-space solar, ie: space-based solar collectors, which can produce amazing amounts of energy, but that's even further off.
Mainly that I don't want the equivalent of a dirty bomb in my home and the risk of contamination if something goes wrong.
And I expect solar prices to continue coming down and efficiency to continue going up to supersede nuclear costs in due course.
Ideally we'd discover fusion.
But the other great thing about solar is decentralized power production. Whereas the more realistic nuclear is centralized large stations.

The key to why he used British and also American spelling is a very simple statistics calculation: to increase the search set to finding him.
One could argue that either he slipped up by starting with British and then used American from then on to through people off the trail, or else that he purposefully used British the one time, then reverted to American which is more natural for him, hoping people would think he's affecting American.
Either way, if he had only ever used the American, that's a much smaller pool of English speakers than if he had thrown in that first British communication, which forces people to consider everyone outside the US too.
However, if I were Satoshi and also an American, it would be a lot easier to affect British up-front, then revert to American. Even one tiny slip-up in American would clue people in that you're actually a British speller. But by including the British up-front, searchers can't discount that he might be just really good at affecting American.
It's a brilliant strategy for increasing the search space that searchers for his identity would have to go through. More than likely it means he's American, but you can't automatically discount that he might not be.
@_date: 2015-12-12 10:13:02
The reason spent from, messaged from addresses can be easily quantum attacked is because info has leaked about the priv-key by virtue of that signing.

All robots are productive multipliers, not labor replacement. The whole point of their activity is to enable human consumption--right? Robots don't consume. There is no robot-to-robot economy.
What happens is prices come down, production goes up, more is produced at a cheaper cost, and living standards go up dramatically.
Also, imagine a future where the "poor" only own a few robots, while the rich own thousands. That's much more likely than a scenario where the poor or middle class are cut out of the economy.

It can be, but the difference is where the remedy lies. When a business is unreasonable, its employees quit and go next door.
When a government is totalitarian and unreasonable, how do you opt out? You're screwed.
Thus it is competition that limits the unreasonableness of corporations. Whereas the government has no competition--it claims a regional monopoly, its power has no check.


See here you've used the word 'power' outside a political context. But in the market there is no such thing as political power.
They might have wealth, but wealth is not force. Wealth only becomes a problem when it allies with force, via ally  with state actors; ie: lobbying and the buying of favorable laws and regulations.
Absent a state to bribe and ally with, a rich corporation's "power" is neutered.
No amount of money can compulse anyone on the market to trade with anyone else. Bill Gates cannot buy my wife no matter how much money he has.
By contract, many powerful political operatives simply kill husbands and take their wives for themselves by force because they are also the monopolist police power and have no one to check their whims.
But this is not possible in a competitive market.

Plus chargebacks, plus fraud risk, counterfeiting, plus transaction insurance cost--and the psychic hassle of the same, plus agreements to keep prices the same across cash and credit (in some places), etc., etc.
Don't pretend the mere transaction fee is the only cost, but even if it were, that would be enough for bitcoin to win in the long run. Even 0.2% isn't nothing to sneeze at when you're talking hundreds of millions of transactions a year across the globe. 
World GDP is said to be somewhere in the range of $70 trillion. If bitcoin could *only* save the world .2% on 80% of the transactions, that would mean it's worth / saving the economy $112 billion a year, multiplied out by 20 years, a standard valuation tactic, bitcoin as a technology should be worth about $2.24 trillion dollars.
Divided into 21 million bitcoin is a price of $107,000 a piece.
 
And that's in our worst-case scenario of saving retailers ONLY 0.2%. Get the hell out of here!

What matters is that the cost of mining was very nearly the price of bitcoin at that time. That always happens, will always happen.
















Again, network effect and path dependence. $30 in bitcoin is actually more valuable than $30 in whatevercoin, because bitcoin is accepted by far more stores, people, wallets, services, etc. 
Path dependence goes right along with that. Stores that accept bitcoin have no reason to accept whatevercoin--they're cryptocurrency base is already covered, bitcoin is, has, and will suck the oxygen out of the room, altcoins on lifesupport now will die. The only altcoins that matter going forward are ones that aren't trying to do or be what bitcoin does and is, things like namecoin or darkcoin that have angles and purposes bitcoin doesn't, and these will integrate as sidechains in time, making bitcoin even more valuable compared to altcoins.


But user buy-in does, ala network effect and path dependence. Read economist Peter Surda's master's thesis on bitcoin.


You can duplicate a cryptocurrency, but not the orbiters that are bought into it. You're missing this fact. You can't duplicate Evorhees for litecoin, or Amir Taaki for doge, nor bitcoin core devs for litecoin.
Look at the beating dogecoin took when its developers short-sightedly removed the inflation limit, because of bad economic understanding on their part.


It's not "hostage taking" because the bitcoin economy *doesn't need new bitcoin*. As I said, you can run the entire world economy on a single bitcoin if you need to. This is honestly a very bad point of reasoning. We don't need more bitcoin, and we don't need all the bitcoin that's been irrevocably lost either. Altcoins don't figure into this at all.


Let the market decide. So far it's decided exactly that. I think you're just injecting your biases here.








No one's forcing anyone to buy bitcoin.


People said that about a price of back when bitcoin was worth less than pennies $1, and $266 was ridiculous 4 months after bitcoin started the year at $12 yet look at that price today would be bought all day long, and just about every other psychological price point that has been hit. Why are people willing to pay $300 today then? Where does it end? Why are people willing to pay $300 but definitely not $3,000 in your mind? I think there's a flaw in your reasoning, you don't have an answer for that.


You're conflating currency and transaction cost though, it's not applicable. A $2 WU is lost. $2 spent into bitcoin is still $2 you can spend elsewhere, it's not lost.
















Gold is arbitrarily limited as well. What matters is that it is limited, not the reason for its limit.


No, it's a real scarcity. If it were artificial this implies it's a state that will be changed, but this isn't true for bitcoin.


Not crypto data. I think you're displaying a cognitive bias against immaterial objects here. Many people do, assuming they can't have value or scarcity.


Good luck with that. If this reasoning were the case we shouldn't be looking at a $300 price today.
















It's not just people participating, it's the retailers and businesses it's a part of. Does Bitpay and Coinbase deal in litecoin? Nope. Did Andreas dev for other altcoins? Nope.
















I could if I had a buyer. From an investment point of view you're correct. However what I was trying to get across is that if the price of bitcoin rises to $1200 and stays there, that's not suddenly "expensive" unless you expect that price to be unsustainable. It's just the current price. If you expect the price to actually rise from there, then it's cheap. Why do many of us still buy bitcoin at $313 when we bough for $20 last year?
























Such people may be looking at the longer term. Bitcoin has often been a poor store of value for short-term investors. However for long-term investors it's been consistently amazing. You can't lose money by holding bitcoin for less than 2 years thus far. If you bought at the $33 runup, then 2 years brings you into the $265 runup and balance of $100, if you bought at $266, one year brings you to the $1200 runup and balance of $600 down to $300 today. 
At least you're honest about your caveats. 
















Retailers and remittance buyers are the two that come to mind immediately. Remittances function without people caring about value store. Retailers don't care either.


Price stability will come with increasing market cap. At that point, normal people won't be chased off by volatility and won't care.


Do tell. But they're building remittance services around BTC today, not LTC. If you reasoning is true, then why should that be the case? Network effect, bro.

Good thing it's not an either-or decision then, isn't it. Retailers are accepting bitcoin alongside other payment methods.
However when companies begin gaining experience with bitcoin they are likely to conclude the obvious, that bitcoin transactions give them more profit than other kinds of transactions.
The rest follows naturally from there.

At what cost? Security is not the only thing at issue, but rather the space cost of storing transactions, the change to mining, etc. Besides, why make a major change for a mere 'same security'? Not even improved security.

Strange thing to argue, since it's obvious and undisputed.
Ultimately credit cards must lose in the face of bitcoin, because of its lower cost basis.

Inevitably that means price drops, and further adoption. Etc.

Prognosis for litecoin is tough to call. It seems a solid effort but there's a real question of whether we need a backup crypto-currency or not. Maybe it will find a niche, maybe it won't.

Right, but what stops a loan contract from simply taking actual deflation into account when calculating the repayment value of the loan?

I might very well, yes, it's called an investment, or a bond. And people engage in investing and buying bonds in successful businesses all the time right now, and surely will continue to do so. Especially if they had assets covering their loans. 








Bitcoin won't always be an appreciating asset. We're still in early days and bitcoin hasn't found its mass market price. Let's pretend in 20 years that 1 btc is worth $100k of today's money. We're going to be a lot less worried about either volatility or appreciation, because it's market cap will be ginormous and its appreciation potential will be effectively over.

It's not so unusual. Does the child not accept everything from the womb and adapt to it as natural? 
Slave children in recounting the tale of their childhood even have gone so far as to say they thought even being beaten and raped to be normal. 
To go to ridiculous extremes there have been experiments that raised kittens in a room that contained nothing but black and white stripes everywhere. When they were brought out into nature, on grass and open skies, they were bewildered.
A man raised in a primitive-culture, in the dense jungle, was brought to the plains and buffalo were pointed out to him in the far off distance some miles away. Unable to comprehend what he was seeing, because he'd never once in his life been able to see anything that wasn't more than 30 yards from his face, he said these creatures were as small as ants.
The most powerful tool of the state is the ability of the human brain to absorb its surroundings and acculturate to them. This gives it automatic force of existence in their minds, a premise upon which they automatically rely on as normal.
As an example of how powerful this can be, there is an event that changed the entire world. It was the Crusades, but many miss what actually happened. The Crusaders went down and did stupid and evil things everywhere they went, but ultimately they ended up seizing Jerusalem. 
They lived in Jerusalem for 80 years. In that time the original crusaders died out, quite naturally, and their children came to rule the city, and then their children. After 80 years the muslims around them forced them to go back to Europe.
But by this point the invaders had become significantly culturally Islamized. Almost everything we think of as modern and western was at that point unknown in Europe and well known in the near east, and was brought back to Europe by these crusaders on their return journey. From fine silks to makeup, to all sorts of books and learning.
At the time europe was full of brutes who believed in war and violence above all. The Europeans who returned to england were extremely different. They brought back with them a trait learned from the muslims that would change everything: the concept of the gentleman, the idea that a person could be both compassionate and strong.
This idea swept europe, becoming the true goal of the knight, the sign of nobility, and it is something that is well known about Western people even to this day. Even as the Muslim world lost that very trait for other reasons.
This is why it's vitally important that we establish our own region ASAP. The first generation of ancap children to be born in a free seastead will be the world's first children of true freedom, and the world should tremble at what they will make possible and do. They will be limitless ones that change the entire world,

@_date: 2014-09-01 02:27:31


Bitcoin has a commodity value, it's just vanishingly small compared to its overall exchange value. That is the value of a bit of electricity and disc space devoted to it.








This isn't true though. It's only true in the via of currency as having to be a commodity. Bitcoin instead can be viewed as the first digital commodity. It may not have physical commodity status, but it may have digital commodity status--because it transmits its value with it, it does not refer to an outside value like digital transactions involving fiat do.
Remember that fiat came about first as scrip for a commodity good. Bitcoin has not gotten started this way, instead deriving its value from being the lowest transaction-cost currency, meaning its commodity value is tied to its exchange value.
It is the first of its kind, a money that relies on its exchange value as its first value, rather than fiat and physical moneys that relied on their commodity value as their first value.
Commodity money and indeed fiat itself also came to rely on their exchange value. Prior to bitcoin we had examples of a money that didn't go the commodity route. Now we do.
This doesn't make it "like fiat", since the way fiat got established was by piggybacking off the credibility of scrip for commodities, whereas bitcoin got started by its promise as a superior form of exchange value--it's lower transaction cost status.
And that's still its killer business case to this day. Lot's of people don't understand that.


There is, actually--the fact of bitcoin being the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. It's cheaper than every form of money for those kinds of transaction. This is a killer feature and very desirable. 


See above for its killer application. If it had no business case, as you assume, it wouldn't likely have any value still to this day.


The network effect can't jumpstart a currency, it can only come after the fact. The case for bitcoin was built on its lower transaction costs from the beginning, even if people didn't understand it back then.

There's a price equilibrium with miners too, however, that you seem to be deprecating.
Price and mining-costs must remain in equilibrium. If bitcoin price remains under the cost of mining, miners will stop mining.
It's almost inconceivable to imagine the mining power going backwards long-term. That means the price should rise.
And again, miners will stop selling rather than sell at a loss, so it won't be $500k lost to the market, it will be $1 million worth of bitcoin lost a day until the price rises enough for them to begin selling again.

This is quite simply ignorant.
If you say government is required to have roads and bridges then you're really saying that the only way to finance the construction of them is by force, that is by taxation.
But this isn't true. A large number of roads and turnpikes were privately built in centuries past.


Do you think I would like that? Nope.
Lots of people seem to assume that an anarchy means no laws, no courts, no police--I remember when I thought this, having had only surface contact with the ideology.
But here's what I discovered, that [anarcho-capitalism](isn't against law, police, or courts, it's only against the *monopolization* of them by government that we're against.
Aren't you against monopoly? Isn't monopoly a *bad thing*? I think it is, most people do too. But they don't stop to ask themselves why a monopoly in food production or fuel is bad but a monopoly in government services should be good.
In fact it's not good. A monopoly always produces the highest cost at the lowest quality.
What the [anarcho-capitalists](figured out is how to separate *government* from **governance**.
Governance are those vital services we all know we *need* for society to function, including money, law, police, and courts.
People have been taught that **governance** is inseparable from government. But that's not true.
Bitcoin is a private money outcompeting state money.
Private police (security agencies) and private arbitrative courts already exist in our current society.
The last remaining piece of the puzzle is private law. Private law is not so easy to deal with, but I've been working on these concepts and discovered a way, through The result is that an ancap society is just as immune to some tough guy taking your shit as our current society. In fact, you stuff should be even more secure than it is now, for it cannot be taken from you in an ancap society by either taxation or eminent domain.

Doesn't really matter what Joe Public is willing to pay, what matters is supply and demand.
If the majority of bitcoin-exchange market supply is coming from mining, which currently seems to be the case, and that supply halves, that's a supply shock. If demand remains the same, the price must roughly double. Joe public doesn't know or care why supply has shocked necessarily, only seeing that they're twice as rare as they were before.








That's not how bid/ask works though. You struggle to find bids over $400 because supply meets demand at $315 or w/e it is today. When demand exceeds supply, suddenly $400 may become the new normal. 
We're talking about taking 1800 bitcoin off the market *per day*, that's a huge chunk of supply. All the market exchanges will be hit with supply shock.








That may prove to be true, but you can't ignore that much of the current market supply of bitcoin comes directly from miners. That's how the two correlate.

That's not really possible. Mining power will always rise to within about 2% of the current price, increasing the cost of mining to 98% or so of the price of 1 bitcoin.
So if bitcoin is worth $300, then the mining cost to generate one bitcoin will rise to about $294. Or somewhere around there.
During the BRH the cost to generate one bitcoin *doubles* overnight. Miners will still generally keep mining, but they won't sell because they'd be selling at a loss. For your scenario to remain true half of all mining power would have to shut down, halving the cost of mining, and I don't see that happening. Didn't happen last time.
Instead miners tend to buy when the price of bitcoin is under their generation cost, since they know that means all miners will not be selling. This happened last in BRH2012. 
Maybe, some miners will shut down, but I wouldn't expect it to be more than 20%, and I'd expect power-miner companies to quickly take up that slack in expectation.

No, currency works very differently from other kinds of things and you are making a category error. Stick with currency, stop reasoning by analogy.
Inflation and deflation can be caused by one of two things, changes in supply or demand.
Since demand for currency is always essentially infinite (not true for other goods, and ignoring other currencies), supply is the critical factor.
All goods are priced in currency. Thus if you increase the amount of currency its purchasing power must drop, causing prices to rise, this is inflation, and vice versa for deflation.
If the amount of goods increases but the currency remains static, this is how deflation typically occurs. This is good deflation.
Governments try to hide their theft by increasing the supply of currency at the same rate as new goods appear.
But where did the value of all that new money come from? It came by reducing the value of all other money.
Inflation is theft. You cannot create value out of thin air.

In this case a bank takes your money, say $400, and provides you with an account balance whereby it says that there is $400 in your account.
But this is a fraud. In fact the $400 is not in your account but has been loaned out. There is $0 in your account, they're only providing you an account balance equal to what they owe you.
And if they have enough of their loans go bad, they will not have the collateral to pay back everyone what they owe.
This is why anything that's not a 100% reserve banking system is a fraud.

Sure, except that if a retailer begins taking bitcoin they can charge less in the first place due to their lower transaction costs.
Cash won't help you there. 








And what percentage of purchases are cash these days, and is that percentage going up or down?
A. It's a low percentage.
B. Going down.




You're making a losing argument. 
Cash has its own costs, it doesn't work online, you have to physically manage it, you can't take international or distanced purchases that way, you have to have good controls or employees steal it from you, you have to count it and physically take it to banks, you have to train against counterfeiting, and a hundred other things. Don't pretend cash is going to save the dollar.

Certainly could be true, though I don't think the case is as absolute as you make it out to be.
Let's say in the worst case scenario that some alt-coin comes out that blows away bitcoin in every single way. How does the community respond?
The programmers would likely toss out bitcoin's programming and adopt the new open-source altcoin, port over the same wallet balances for everyone, and and the like. 
Of course that won't happen.
The only feature I can imagine that's killer is true privacy, and Darkcoin is chasing that tail. And it's not open source. That's a problem.

This isn't exactly true. Bitcoin has a compelling economic advantage that has nothing to do with the beliefs of users. Bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for international and online purchases. Whether bitcoin-users realize that or not, or understand it or not, plays into their belief about the value of bitcoin. 
And here's the secret--those of us who actually do understand this most important fact about bitcoin *are incredibly bullish about it, and are strong hands,* and those who do not understand it remain skeptical about bitcoin or are weak hands.
It's not a good decade to have shallow training in economic matters, since bitcoin's likely success requires at least minor technical sophistication in economics to grasp.
Luckily for me, I understood it when the price was only $12 &gt;_&gt;


SHA being broken would be a pretty huge blow. Which is why it's good that it's risk in existential terms is considerably lower than the risk of hyperinflation by the US dollar, which is historically likely at some point in the near future, whereas SHA being broken is not necessarily ever likely for the entire future history of humanity. Though that's a bit hubristic, and it's perhaps more safe for me to say that it can be easily patched out proactively should a new form of mathematics that threatens it be created.
But it's also entirely possible that that won't happen. Even math has ultimate limits, and modern crypto made prove more historically hardy than we currently think, simply because we have been alive in a time when crypto was both weak and computers were weak, and have seen how easily computer advances broke modern crypto, but that situation may be coming to a very rapid end. It certainly has already from the brute-force perspective. You will not brute force SHA-256, ever.








See there I very much disagree. What is far more likely is that you'd have a camp of people claiming that SHA is too weak to be relied upon and they'd start up an alt coin with a new hashing alg as a demonstration piece, complete with how to transition. And as long as the SHA weakness remained theoretical the cost of switching would be too high to bother. And when SHA was ultimately proved to fail then the world would switch, and these guys would already likely have ASICs and miners ready to go under the new alg, resulting in a mining rush into the new alg's ASICs, led btw by the old mining companies whom still have optimal site and space to continue mining, though it would certainly cost them a pretty penny, but those who moved fast would stand to make a tidy profit by getting it with a reduced difficulty as the stragglers stumbled.
The fact of bitcoin being the lowest transaction cost currency, and the one with the most buy-in and infrastructre, can never go away.


It's not merely emotional attachment though. It's the network effect, which says that a network grows more valuable the more people that are a part of it.
What chance does a new fax-system have when every company in the world already has a fax machine. Think of the madness of trying to pitch to them a fax machine that's not compatible with current fax machines, but is in some way a slightly better fax machine.
You'd never get it off the ground.
For the same reasons the creator of FedEx (IIRC) built the company from scratch and then much later became unhappy with how his execs were running the company, and claimed he could rebuild the whole thing from scratch on his own.
So he did. He spent, iirc, $10 million of his personal fortune trying to build a competitor to FedEx, his own company, and he failed completely. FedEx already owned that new space that previously hadn't been there.
Good enough is good enough.
This is why despite sharing the goals of Darkcoin I don't own any dark coin. Bitcoin is likely to patch in competing desirable attributes rather than be replaced by these altcoins.

Because a good predictor of whether the price of bitcoin will rise in the short term is whether the most efficient miners can make a profit mining.
I admit it surprised me when I first heard a pro miner group explain what they actually do in relation to price. When price goes under their cost of coin production, they don't stop mining, they just stop selling and start buying. The buying is a hedge and to cover costs on the back-side after the price rises (they hope) for the time that they are not covering costs by not selling.
So they essentially are borrowing on bitcoin by buying at a lower price that they expect must rise.


Even if miners don't buy bitcoin the logic still works, since they will stop selling. But I think if you look into it, all sorts of former miners have begun buying after their miners became no longer cost competitive. Hell, I'm one of them.

Bitcoin is the first currency that can be transmitted *with its value* rather than referring to it, over communication lines. Paper can't be transmitted over distances, neither can gold. This is because bitcoin's a digital currency. Any digital currency could do this, bitcoin is the first to have traction.
What you have to realize is that the price of a thing that is used as a currency is made up of several different kinds of value, as valued by human beings. Bitcoin is an exceptionally good money, combining all the features that make gold a good currency, as well as a few that gold can't match, including the ability to be easily moved across distances (digitally).
For gold, it's estimated that somewhere around 10% - 30% of its market value is *commodity value*, and the rest is *exchange value*, meaning people valuing it because of its qualities as money and value store.
Today gold is valued purely for its value-store value, its price would have to increase considerably were it still being used as money, since there's not much of it to go around.
So bitcoin's price is primarily exchange value, since its commodity value is vanishingly small (a bit of electricity and disk space).


Nothing has intrinsic value--value is in the mind of the valuer. So when you look at bitcoin and you see that you could use bitcoin as a currency easier and cheaper than other forms of currency, then *you value it* and by that accord it value.


No, it's qualities and characteristics are valued by people, and they therefore value it as a system. Beyond that they also value the bitcoin ecosystem, people that are supporting this particular cryptocoin and can't be copied by any altcoin outright.


Imagine that gold had no commodity uses. People would still be able to see that it could make a great medium of exchange. It's just like that for bitcoin.
People look for certain characteristics in a currency. It needs to be somewhat rare, unduplicable, fungible, divisible, verifiable, a store of value at least in the short term to facilitate an exchange--without degrading (ie: doesn't rust), tradeable, etc. 
What had always stopped egold-schemes from succeeding before was no one could figure out how to make a digital-good a unique good, until the blockchain.


People aren't just valuing the code, they're valuing the network effect surrounding bitcoin, all the people that have already bought into it, all the stores that have integrated bitcoin, the payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay that are working every day to improve bitcoin.
That can't be said for other cryptocoins.

Not necessarily. It will certainly be more rare than the practices that led to the '08 housing bubble crash! So in that sense, of preventing idiotic policies and large-scale systemic crisis, yes, it will be rarer than that, in the sense of entirely preventing it--which is a good thing.
But out of the reach of most people? Probably not. A society where money isn't politically controlled may have more overall wealth to invest than our current one that deprecates saving in favor of borrowing.
If we went back to a non-manipulable money, like bitcoin, then the trend would revert to saving, and the great abundance of capital could mean about the same amount of loans as now.

@_date: 2014-03-18 03:22:52
**The unique value proposition of bitcoin is dramatically lower transaction costs for distanced and online transactions.**
This translates into economic utility and thus market demand and thus a non-zero market price. This fact was ferreted out first, to my knowledge, by economist Peter Surda who did his master's thesis on Bitcoin in 2012.
Since using bitcoin for transactions is cheaper than using any other competing currency for distanced and online transactions, people will tend to demand bitcoin. And as distanced and online transactions become a larger fraction of all total transactions, bitcoin will become increasingly valuable.
If you want to know why bitcoin originally had a non-zero value then there were three components to its value upon creation. Firstly it has a vanishingly small but still existing commodity value in the form of a very small amount of electricity used to record each part of the blockchain. This is electricity that could be used for any purpose, but it is and was being used for bitcoin. Similarly bitcoin took up calculation time and disk-space that could be used for other things.
Besides that, bitcoin also had what you might call fetish-value or 'cool-factor' for a certain subgroup, that being the cypherpunks and crypto-fanatics who first dreamed up the idea of ecash decades ago and have been salivating over the idea ever since, and it's this same group that created it and developed it. 
These are the people that collected and mined bitcoin in the very early years before anyone else, because they thought it was awesome merely as a concept.
There's also the people who collected it as an investment early on, who believed it would grow in value.
So, those three main things contributed to its non-zero value: vanishingly small commodity value, cool-factor, and prospectors who treated it as a very risky investment or value-store.
Today we have people still using it for its low transaction costs, especially in international remittance where it's orders of magnitude cheaper than the traditional Western Union service and competitors.
And we have a lot of people treating it as value store and a long-term investment generally.
Another reason for its non-zero value is that it has much lower existential risks than other currencies.
With bitcoin you can be reasonable sure that no one person controls it and thus no person can manipulate it for their own benefit, and what that really means is that it's non-inflationary.
All fiat currencies face the existential risk of mismanagement which historically has turned into hyperinflation and destruction of the currency thereby, whenever the political class gets in trouble with their finances and succumb to the temptation to inflate.
Bitcoin is a currency that likely can lasts thousands of years, cross all borders and cultures, and not suffer inflationary mismanagement.
The only real existential risk bitcoin faces is a catastrophe big enough to interrupt internet services, something on the order of world-wide EMP attack, which is rather unlikely, and becomes less likely as satellite-based internet takes over.
And the other existential risk is people deciding they prefer an alt-coin which does something bitcoin can't do. Technically there's nothing another alt-coin can do that bitcoin can't, but there may be reasons why bitcoin devs choose not to.
I'm speaking specifically of anonymity. In an attempt to avoid negative regulation, bitcoin devs may choose not to make bitcoin truly anonymous, even as that tech is beginning to appear right now in the form of Zerocoin.
So there's some uncertainty there, but likely the two will co-exist for sometime and then bitcoin will adopt Zerocoin's privacy concepts if it starts to threaten, and that will end that.
So, that's a pretty good fast run-down. That summary only took me 6 months of extensive study and debate with economists on the Mises.org forum to obtain the requisite knowledge, but it was worth it ultimately :) I realized bitcoin could be a genuine currency and was definitely a contender for worldwide currency status.

All I'm saying is that what one coin can do via code another coin can do via code.
It doesn't really matter if bitcoin is "the one" cryptocurrency that "wins." If any cryptocurrency succeeds long term, that's great and all I personally care about.
In the same way that television and newspapers both carry news but each can do things the other cannot, fiat and cryptocurrencies are each in a class of their own and have features the other cannot replicate.
But competition within a class is much tighter, and in theory at least, what one cryptocoin can do another cryptocoin can do, even if it requires large sacrifices.

Technically yes, but in the case of Doge there's an additional risk, the idiocy of its programmers in doing things like building inflation into the coin and the like, which are policies many of us are trying to escape by using bitcoin.
So with Doge you have an additional risk that they'll decide to simply change the rules along the lines of whatever pop economics they are into at the time.
Luckily they've already shot themselves in the foot once on that score and largely faded from the limelight. 
Bitcoin, by contrast, is mainly in the hands of libertarians with, from my perspective, generally fairly sound economic principles that deprecate things like political control of a currency (duh) and inflation (double duh).

You take money from people by force and you spend it on X.

Instead of the bank presuming to take their money and relend it, the bank will have to arrange with depositors whether or not they want to incur the risk of participating in loaning out their money, or else keep it in full reserve in savings.
The way banks do it now where they don't even ask is actually fraudulent, and your average person has no idea that their funds are being risked at all. It's all "legal" of course, if not ethical, due to long practice and collusion with government, and the mirage of being able to print new money if there's a liquidity issue.
Fortunately bitcoin obviates any need to carry a bank account merely for storing money, and instead "saving and loan" companies will take over that use investor funds to invest in businesses and home mortgages.

Have you analyzed that scenario, or what the response of the bitcoin community would be if SHA were broken?
The result is not actually the systemic failure of bitcoin permanently, unlike a hyperinflation of the dollar from which there is no return--the result might be a few hours or days of downtime as they freeze the blockchain in place before the first likely abusive spends were detected, and then they'd replace SHA with a new algorithm and issue a new QT and life continues on as before, surely with some major disruption and adjustment, but nonetheless.
There's no technical flaw that can be found in bitcoin that cannot be patched out as a result. And finding those flaws now and early is actually both important to do, and a goal of our current community. And we've suffered big bugs in the past and lived through them, including the kind of blockchain forks that stopped all transactions dead in their tracks for a few hours until a new client got released to deal with it, as in my scenario.
So, no, I disagree. It would be temporary at best.

* Transaction time is very long compared to what people are used to normally with credit cards and such.
Not so. Buy something with bitcoin and see how long a transaction takes, it's actually on par or faster than most CC transactions. The system must spend a few seconds looking for a double-spend attempt, but then it can confirm the transaction and be sure with a high confidence that the transaction is good. When you buy something with Bitpay it actually makes this explicit by showing a screen that says like 'looking for transaction' then when it sees it, 'looking for double spend attempt' and failing to see one it confirms the transaction, because to work a double-spend must occur at virtually the exact same moment as the spend.
Only for very large transactions would you even bother to wait for 6 confirmations, since the dollar figure is worth the time (say like buying a house or a car), and such transactions already take much more time than that right now. Heck, buying a house can take weeks.
* When mining is no longer profitable then how will the network remain robust and secure? Why would people keep mining if they're losing tons of money doing it?
What makes you think mining will ever be unprofitable? That's not how it works, profit is automatically baked into the hash-rate to the point that the most efficient miner should be able to always make about a 2% profit at minimum. Because for those whose profit reverse they'll take hashing power off the network.
Apart from that, once the production of new coins diminishes significantly, the main source of profit will be tips included in the transaction block. That probably won't take over as the prime profit source for a good ten years or more though.
In short, this is a non-problem.
* As far as I understand the network doesn't scale well. I assume some work is being done to fix this - bitcoin can change and adapt I believe.
Yes, in fact iirc Garzik just tweeted about using block hashes rather than including the whole block, which would allow the number of transactions included to be standardized and stop incentivizing miners to include small blocks to favor speed.
* How is everyone so content with mining pools being so centralized and mining so close and sometimes exceeding 50 percent? That's really scary IMO.
They always pull back when it happens because of the risk. It's not in their interest to be at or near 50%, much less to perform an actual attack. It's existential risk mainly, and such centralization is due to bitcoin being young and new. It will branch out over time. Hell, when bitcoin first started there was only Satoshi mining with 100% of the network hashing power :P Things have gotten better over time, not worse.


Good luck :) We're here because we've long since had these challenges answered for us too.

You take me for a fool. My only major predication some-time ago was that [$100+ was the 'new normal']( and it hasn't dipped past that since then.


You'll ntoice I didn't talk about what the price may be in 2016, saying only it essentially had to double, whatever it is. Or mining needs to half, or some combination of the two so that mining and price and in equilibrium again. That is a necessity. 
What the price is, is largely immaterial. But it's a lot easier for the price to double than for half the miners to give up.


No, I think it's quite likely speculators will price into the BRH well before it happens due to the price increase experienced in BRH2012.
But it's also possible that this kicks off another period of market exuberance leading up to a price spike yet again. Such spikes aren't entirely positive for many reasons, especially as rhetorical fodder for buttcoin trolls like you.








That's ridiculous.


No, demand AND supply, only we normally think of the supply as relatively constantly inflating at a low level. However the BRH is a true change in supply, halving newly mined bitcoin.
What remains an open question is how much of current market supply is newly-mined bitcoin. Although that could probably be answered by some data researcher, not something I'm capable of however.


Again, simple economics. Price is the intersection of supply and demand. If demand remains constant and supply halves, the price must rise. Tell me you at least understand that much about economics. It's literally economics 101.


Increased demand or reduced supply, either will create a price increase.








Again, from the perspective of the miners, they don't simply stop mining. They keep mining and also *buy bitcoin* themselves. Not only do they reduce daily supply considerably, they also raise demand themselves. That affects everyone looking to buy. Price isn't magical at any level. Bitcoin at $300 is the same bitcoin at $1 and $3000, the difference is supply and demand. 
Prior to BRH daily supply was 7200 and price was about $12. Demand has certainly risen since then, and the first BRH brought price up to $266 within months of the BRH (market exuberence), down to $70 after, and $100 for most of the rest of the year, a roughly 8 times price increase from before the BRH.
You're wondering why people would pay more? Why are they paying more now compared to our recent past? Answer that and the same will hold true in the future.








The fact of permanently more scarce new bitcoins is a reason to pay more. That's the definition of lowered supply.








Apples get used up in the course of eating them. Bitcoin don't get used by using them to buy things. You have to stick within the realm and reasoning of money. People buy apples to eat, generally. People buy bitcoin to trade for items, not consume personally.
If you want to reason about bitcoin with apples you'd be far better off taking a distributor's point of view. He buys apples to trade, much like one would use bitcoin.
Let's say you're an apple distributor. An apple-blight hits which makes all apples more scarce for that season--this sort of thing happens all the time. And he's perfectly willing to buy apples for $5 each if he thinks he can make a reasonable amount of profit on them. If his buyers are telling him they can sell apples for $7 a piece, he's willing to buy at $5. You don't care what the price is as long as the value is there.
Price increases come because people will buy apples within a price certain range. But apples have a certain amount of price elasticity regardless, and price elasticity doesn't apply to currencies. That's the problem with your analogy.
If a bitcoin is $300 or $300k, you don't *lose money* by buying bitcoin in the same way you'd be getting a bad deal by paying $30 for an apple rather than $3.
$3 for an apple is *consumed* along with the apple. Paying for a bitcoin, at any price, is not consumed in the act--as long as the price doesn't subsequently go down. And in the case of the BRH, that BRH is permanent.

A year, that's nothing in the grand scale of things. Do you imagine an altcoin will suddenly surge to prominence over bitcoin in a year? No chance.








No one ever said we won't have altcoins, only that they aren't likely to surpass bitcoin in adoption and importance. Also, we've always had multiple currencies because governments can invisibly steal via inflation. This is partly why bitcoin was created.








None of this assumes perfect rationality. And none of this is an argument for bitcoin adoption, but an explanation as to why things are and have been and will continue to play out as they are.
No one needs to be convinced of anything for path dependence and the network effect to take place, they are descriptors of phenomena that arise in the normal course of human interaction in all kinds of systems.

If you centralize the ledger you might be able to achieve similar cost savings, sure, but you also lose out on confidence and the benefits of [decentralization](Transaction costs aren't low *just because* of the coin's digital nature, but also because of the static inflation schedule.
What is the inflation schedule of a centrally controlled coin? You don't know. It could be zero-% today and a thousand-% tomorrow. 
A centrally controlled crypto-coin is actually worse than a paper currency on this score, because the marginal cost of time and materials to make extra currency is very close to zero. At least with fiat money they have to actually spend money and time printing bills (well, mostly).
So, while I eventually expect some countries to try this, ala Ecuador, I don't consider them a threat to bitcoin generally. And I expect their citizens to eventually repudiate them.

You don't get it. Higher price is something Joe's looking for, because it means stability and legitimacy. He's not buying it as an investment but as a medium of exchange, and for such buyers price is immaterial because $50 in bitcoin equals $50 worth of goods bought with bitcoin.
As bitcoin transitions from a speculative investment to ordinary economic activity, that's the kind of bitcoin buyer that's going to be out there buying bitcoin, to transact with, not to horde for value.

It's not a postulation, it's what an employee of one of the big professional miner groups told me they actually do. They do it because they know that if they can't make a profit selling bitcoin (because they're already a lowest-cost producer) then neither can anyone else and that should mean a small supply shock to bring the price up.


If they expect the price to rise soon as a result, it's a rational thing to do. What's more it increases demand slightly.


You're assuming it's going to go down, they're assuming it's going up. They may have seen it happen enough times that they feel confident investing along those lines. 








Nah, confirmations don't end up taking longer in either case.

My point is, companies are forced to use unsecured accounts due to payroll.
A mid-size company might have to cover $1 million a month in pay roll expenses, let's say, and yet their bank account is insured only up to $250k.
That's an existential risk, and also bit Cyprus businesses in the ass recently when they took that haircut, causing at least one business to fold as a result.
@_date: 2014-07-27 07:24:56


And they'd pay for it too. Even now a lot of large companies will regularly have more than $250k in their account just to cover payroll, which is more than FDIC will insure, and it's a very great risk for them.
When Cyprus confiscated all bank accounts over $XXX whatever it was dollar, many companies were forced to fold their businesses due to losing many hundreds of thousands. It was a very great eff-you to the business community, and many left Cyprus as a result.

When you form a company you generally have investors. So say they raise 10,000 BTC from investors with their business plan and intention to loan it out to home buyers.
There you go. They are lending their own money, happily risked to them by investors.

No, but it puts pressure on all coins to not duplicate functionality and have a reason to exist that's not duplicated by other coins.
Thus like I said, if you need privacy you sidechain to Darkcoin, if you need to deal with property you can sidechain to Namecoin. Why would you sidechain to another coin that's also trying to be a currency? And why would that altcoin implement the sidechain system for bitcoin if it is trying to compete with bitcoin directly?

It didn't happen in BRH2012, why do you think it would suddenly happen the next time.


It's not quite arbitrary, it's an unstoppable event. And remember, price doesn't really matter. You put $30 into bitcoin and you now own $30 worth of bitcoin. All that changes is how many decimals of bitcoin that turns into. So it's not as bad as you seem to think.
If professional miners are forced to turn off equipment it's not likely coming back on, so they will do what they can to prevent that eventuality at all costs, and delay it as long as possible.








Explain BRH2012 then, the price doubled *three times.*
















You shouldn't have tried to bait me into a price schedule prediction that surely would've become a mocking buttcoin post. Nonetheless I'll be nice.








No, I'm giving you a rational reason why supply will diminish--the BRH--and saying *ceteris paribus* on demand.
Unless you can give me a reason why demand would concomitantly diminish due to the BRH I see no reason why demand should be held anything except constant.








Actually I went back and found my prediction, but it was $100 not $300; I edited the post to include the link, so go back and check it out. Slip of the mind.
















Explain. That's not how supply and demand, much less market clearing, works. If average demand isn't meeting average supply the result should be a continually diminishing price. We've had that over the last year since the last runup. However we've had good price stability at over $300 recently. May as well call it a local floor.
















That's... not true at all. I question if you understand how bitcoin works if you can even say this. Bitcoin is limited in supply to 21 million bitcoin and mining produces a strict daily schedule that average about 3600 coins mined a day... I assume you know this, so I guess you're just speaking in dishonest or snide terms or something.
The blockchain figured out how to make scarce items out of non-scarce computer data. That's kind of the point. It's supply is actually fixed and there's no reason in sight to think miners are going to go against their interests and change that algo.












To the extent that cryptocurrency is a currency, it's always in a state of shortage. There's no such thing as owning too much money, in the mind of people. Just one more reason why they have to be reasoned with on their own terms.
Would you ever hear of someone putting their life-savings *in apples?* No, but it has happened often in bitcoin.


Sure but the network effect and path dependence make that unlikely, including the fact that there's no such thing as an expensive bitcoin. Again, if you put $2000 into one bitcoin you didn't just *lose $2000*, it's still there in bitcoin. Higher or lower price doesn't really matter unless you're in it for deflationary gains. For the average person who won't much care about that and just use it for its advantages as a cryptocurrency, who cares.
But that's not a reason to switch to a different cryptocurrency either.

Politicians simply do what they want and then claim things would've been much worse had they acted any other way.
Because of the opportunity cost of acting one way, we can never know whether they're correct or not, and a lot of Austrian theory says they aren't in fact correct, that inflating causes the very bubbles they claim to be fixing, and the great depression was considerably lengthened by the government's activities, not shortened, and that the gov itself is responsible for the current recession, far from preventing another depression.

Do I? Do you think the Venezuelan Bolivar will ever be in double digit inflation?
Because it is right now.
What matters is not what is necessarily, but what *can be*. Bitcoin's inflation rate can ONLY go down from here. Thus its existential risk of inflation is incredibly low compared to all state-managed currencies in the world, and this translates into an increase of confidence and trust in bitcoin.
The dollar, by contrast, can have any inflation rate, from -infinity to positive infinite, and there's no way to control it *for sure*. The dollar's inflation rate is contingent on a great many things, unlike bitcoin's inflation rate.

Lol, it's the single most important fact about bitcoin, and explains why it has a non-zero price, and also why it's not going away. So of course you don't. You could make your previous statement about bitcoin only if you're ignorant of that fact about bitcoin.


Transaction costs go both ways actually. And lower transaction costs result in lower prices ultimately. Possible as much as 3% lower, economy-wide, which would be a very significant wealth gain for an economy that uses cryptocurrency over cash.
You don't care that using bitcoin makes an entire economy more efficient? Then you don't know what economies care about. Because lots of very important things have been done to save less than 1%, and here we have bitcoin more efficient by several percents.








You're going to pay a higher price, however, because it costs the retailer more to service your transaction via credit vs bitcoin. Because they have to rent merchant services by the month, pay for a business bank account, make sure the bank isn't shorting them, pay per-transaction %-based costs which by itself can be as high as 5% for small retailers, and that's not even mentioning the cost of per-transaction insurance and the cost of chargebacks.
So yeah, you will care, you will care when you choose to pay $1.94 for something using bitcoin instead of $2.00 for something else using credit.
People make that decision every day.
It's true they don't know and don't care why bitcoin will be cheaper, but they will care that it results in lower prices, because that's money in their pocket. And you're a moron if you think that means nothing.

This old canard.
You really think the bitcoin devs couldn't just change about 3 lines of code to fix this if it were actually a problem? Because they could.
And what's more it's not needed. Have you ever bought anything with bitcoin, say with Bitpay? The transaction propagates almost instantly, as fast or faster than CC's.
Bitpay's system detects the transaction then looks for doublespend attempts. If it doesn't see an attempt, it considers the purchase to have gone through, because doublespends require virtual immediate attempts at the same time as the actual purchase to be successful.
The only reason to wait after that fact the full 10 minutes would be if the transaction is so important to you, the amount of money so large, that you wanted to be absolutely sure the block goes through.
Generally transactions this large already take a long time, such as buying a car or a house, which can take hours or days or more. Far more than the 6 confirmations generally needed for absolute certainty.
So, in short, you're wrong. And even if you were right, it's probably 3 lines of code to change.

[Why Monetary Expansion Must Stop](










Two Evils of Monetary Expansion


@_date: 2014-11-02 04:26:41


The momentum is driven by bitcoin's economic advantage of being the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. People choose bitcoin over altcoins then because they want the most compatible cryptocoin, the one that has has mass-approval, this is the network effect that says that a network is more valuable to new people the more people that are a part of it--and bitcoin is by far the more important crypto network. And once they've chosen to invest in a coin with both money and merchant services, they're less likely to give other altcoins the same chance, this is path-dependence. 
Beyond that, the network effect and path dependence both work in confluence to create a synthesis effect that drives new people towards bitcoin and away from altcoins the further development there is in bitcoin, the more adopters, etc. 
Sidechains are the cherry on top, essentially cementing all altcoins subservient to bitcoin and reliant on it for future survival. Darkcoin will become a sidechain for privacy. Namecoin becomes a sidechain for real-estate. The penny has dropped and bitcoin has won the altcoin war, much as we predicted years ago. 
Btw, the analysis of path dependence and the network effect giving bitcoin the unbeatable adoption advantage comes from brilliant economist [Peter Surda]( 2012 [master's thesis on bitcoin]( which I recommend to you.
The assumption that bitcoin's popularity is driven by buzz and not by economics is what drove the various scoffer crowd and the like to create memecoins, specifically Doge. They believed they could out-buzz bitcoin and thus either surpass it or perhaps some thought to destroy it.
However the devs that controlled Doge's code were ignorant that economics was driving bitcoin, not doge. They had no idea why people really liked bitcoin; they thought it was being new-cycle pumped and they decided to outpump bitcoin. 
What began as a joke became serious as the coin gained some value. Ultimately they signed the death-knell of doge by removing the limit on coins created. Bitcoin is partly what it is because inflation is not in the interest of users of currency, but the Doge people didn't understand this, and thus Doge is now dying or dead.


Absolutely nothing, but there are many reasons why this is unlikely to go anywhere. To put it bluntly, bitcoin has already drunk your milkshake. Path dependence of those who already bought into bitcoin sucks up the oxygen. It would be like trying to create a new fax-machine network on an incompatible protocol and convince people to buy your new fax-2.0 machine. Unless it has something the other fax machines can't do, then it has absolutely no chance of gaining mass adoption.
Such thinking has led entire countries to try to create their own cryptocurrency, ala Ecuador, and they're going to learn a difficult lesson thereby in the long run. It won't work for them nor solve their currency problems.
I could list off many further reasons why sponsored altcoins aren't a threat to bitcoin. Probably the biggest is that path dependence of people already into bitcoin prevents their widespread adoption. The network effect means a network is more valuable the more people that buy into it. That's something you can't just copy in terms of code. That is to say bitcoin isn't just code but an ecosystem-complexity, and you can't duplicate those other elements that drive bitcoin adoption.
In fact, sidechains in bitcoin integrating altcoins adds all altcoin's network value to bitcoin, making it more valuable than any one of them could ever be individually.
From here on, all altcoins will have to have a unique purpose that isn't the focus of bitcoin. None of them that survive should be focused on being a currency on their own and little else.
Perhaps countries like Ecuador will survive with a locally-approved cryptocurrency that functions by clearing internationally as a bitcoin sidechain. If that's what the future holds, if all countries go that way... things could get very interesting. But if they try to issue more cryptocurrency the way they issued fiat, they'll find repudiation happening yet again.
This isn't even to address the question of development and security and market confidence, which also can't be duplicated by simply copying code.
I know what's going to happen if there's a sudden fault in bitcoin's code, I've seen it happen and seen it resolved, bitcoin devs jump to the computer and solve it before I even know there's a problem, and I know there are extremely smart coders out there working full-time on improving bitcoin's system and adding features. These cannot be control-pasted into a GIT repository either.
What do I know about your fly-by-night altcoin? That the devs controlling it could make a Doge-quality decision and kill it overnight?
I know that no one can remove the coin-limit on bitcoin and create inflation because mining protections prevents it. But if your entity is doing all the mining initially, as it must to start out, you've essentially already 51%'d yourself, with no guarantee that you'll ever convince enough people to buy into mining your system to ever change that, plus no one accepts your altcoin. Bitcoin spent years facing this wall, and companies like Bitpay have been operating for years now. You can't duplicate those either.
Only by buying into the sidechain system can you make your coin relevant to the larger bitcoin ecosystem, and even then you only cement bitcoin in place as top coin, not the reverse.


It can't be done as a mere cryptocoin, because a competitor cryptocoin has no competitive advantage over bitcoin and cannot theoretically gain one, because both bitcoin and every cryptocoin are *just code*, and what one code can do another code can do.
Any feature an alt-coin could develop could be implemented by bitcoin if it ever became important enough to threaten bitcoin's market position. And there would be plenty of incentive to do so.
The result is bitcoin would squash the altcoin like a bug, adopt their feature and it's over for them.
Aha! But what if they don't open source their currency and thus bitcoin can't copy their technique?
That's an even bigger problem. People don't trust secret code, and trust is the name of the game. Look at the problems that Darkcoin has had getting going, and most people, including me, like their proposal! But without a code review who can say if it's got a real solution or not.
It's the same reason the dollar hasn't been superseded as a currency for decades now, it has very little to do with the actual paper dollars are printed on--all fiat currency can do the same things other fiat currencies can do, why isn't the Canadian dollar the world's reserve currency instead?--rather it's the US system, economy, confidence, and military power, etc., that makes the dollar what it is on international markets. The system-complex &gt; the thing itself alone.
Which is why the only possible challenger to the dollar is a currency of another *mode* that can do what the dollar can't possibly do.
And digital crypto is that mode, cryptocurrency is that entity. Cryptocurrencies can do things that fiat currencies cannot do, like transmit themselves with their value over communication lines. This is the key to their lowering of transaction costs, and thus their compelling value-proposition.
I promise you, it's a brave new world we're entering, and questions like yours are important to ask, however they should diminish in doubt with each passing year that bitcoin grows in strength, important, value, adoption, and influence.
Bitcoin will become the dominant world currency eventually, for these and many more reasons, and we are living in the midst of a revolution perhaps as important to humanity eventually as the invention of the computer was to last century. Things will never be the same.

Because the way they responded to the requirement to charge the same price with credit as cash was to raise cash prices to offset the cost of credit prices. Thus cash customers ended up subsidizing credit customers. This is all very basic stuff.


No, competition prevented that.

Name a property of gold that is desirable in its utility as money and bitcoin replicates it, plus adds a few more on top.
You say no one can replicate gold--they don't have to. Asteroid mining will begin in the next few decades, and it's estimated that a single metals-rich asteroid has as much gold as all the gold mined in human history, and there are tens of thousands of asteroids in our solar system that are metals heavy.
Gold's rarity is artificial, bitcoin's is absolute.

And do you think they're in the business of losing money? How much BTC do you think they've lost to double-spend attempts. Let me clue you in: zero.


Problem in your mind, not a problem in actuality. As I said, only a very small range of high value transactions require actually waiting for confirmations.
A successful double-spend costs a good deal to setup and try to pull off in the first place. Anyone attempting a double-spend for a couple hundred dollars or less would be losing money.


lol, if you could prove Bitpay's losing money to double-pays I'm sure the entire bitcoin world would be shocked, because last time I heard anyone talk about it the only successful double-spend attempt was done as an experiment during the last accidental client-upgrade hard-fork. 








Because it doesn't need to be done.


I don't agree, actually.

There's actually something you're missing though, the true inflation rate. 
You see, while countries are targeting an inflation rate of about 2%, they're able to hide the true rate of inflation because all currency is naturally deflationary if left alone, to the tune of at least a couple percents generally, reflecting all the persistent wealth that is generated for the year, and increased demand for currency as new people enter the economy, etc.
So let's say the true rate of deflation is actually more like 3%, but this is hidden entirely by inflating that 3% away--that wealth goes straight into government coffers, completely invisibly, and then they add another 2% on top of that, because that's about as much as they can get away with without angering people.
So the true inflation rate is actually more like 5%. Which means bitcoin will be the best currency by 2017.
Kinda hard to believe things will change that rapidly in just a few years, and we're here seeing it now.
I didn't catch the first wave of bitcoin adoption, but I'm proudly in the 2nd. After 2017 will begin the 3rd wave.
As much as adoption right now is being offset by whales cashing out, when mass adoption begins occurring the opposite effect will take place, people won't want to cash out, not even those with vast sums, because bitcoin will become a currency in its own right, globally so, and thus the price will shed its fetters and begin rocketing.

Well Reddit solved a very great problem: how to make sure that the best stories got to the front and top based on their merits, and how to let sub-forums form organically.

This may not be true. China is stalling right now, choking on debt. Their economic development recently has been rapid because they've had so very much catching up to do.

Instead, think of them as Argentina 2.0, which once was the darling of South America with a living standard on par with France or Germany in the early 20th, but then faltered and their star fell soon after, and ever since.

The purchasing power of a unit of fiat is determined by the total quantity of fiat. Let's say there's $1 million in fiat currency in the world. To add another $1 you must reduce the purchasing power of each of those $1 million by 1/one-million.
This is a theft of 1/one-millionth from each holder of that currency.
Regardless of reason for inflating, or the intent thereof, or even economic activity, inflation is theft, it is a zero-sum game.

I agree, but I think that price runup will be a matter of months beforehand, not much more than that, in anticipation of a runup. I count that as part of the BRH price increase.
Perhaps then miners will be wary and simply not add more mining power even as the price increases in the months ahead of time, but in either case the result should be a price increase during 2016 of roughly double.

No, bitcoin's intrinsic value is its utility *as a currency* which supersedes all other currencies. This is known as *exchange value* in economic circles and is affected by a thing's quality and capability to serve as a medium of exchange.
For instance, it's estimate that gold's market value is perhaps 10% commodity value and 90% exchange value.
Why does gold make a good currency? Because it never rusts, easily differentiated from other metals by various means (color, weight, mass, resistance to acids, etc), difficulty in counterfeiting, etc., etc., etc.
But gold also has downsides that led to be it being replaced by fiat--heavy, expensive to transport, difficulty to train people to accept it, and there's not enough of it actually, thus people came to rely on silver generally.
An analysis of bitcoin as a functional currency shows it has all of gold's strengths and characteristics considered desirable in a currency, *plus a few more that gold lacks*, and none of the downsides of gold.
Thus, bitcoin is a better currency that even gold was.
The same analysis of tulips as currency shows them incredibly inferior to gold. They cannot serve as a store of value because they corrupt over time, their rarity was always an illusion and in fact the most expensive ones were based on a tulip virus that was not well understood but can be reproduced at will now--meaning artificial scarcity, they are also expensive to store and trade, etc., etc.
Conclusion: bitcoin is nothing like tulips.

You're looking only at the demand side of using bitcoin. On the supply side using bitcoin is far cheaper than using existing credit-card based systems. Even if bitcoin is only marginally cheaper, or not cheaper at all for consumers using it to buy, bitcoin is far cheaper for sellers, who don't have to pay for a terminal to accept cards, don't have to pay transaction insurance, never have to cover a chargeback on a bitcoin transaction, never get charges reversed on them, and don't have to pay any fee at all for taking a bitcoin payment.
That doesn't just help the retailer selling using bitcoin, it actually helps all of society and the buyers too. It can make prices a few percents cheaper for the buyer, which means the buyer now has more money in their pocket overall--all of society's standard of living has now gone up by using bitcoin.
So, look at the question of cost of using bitcoin wholistically, from both sides. I haven't even mentioned the infrastructure cost of banks compared to bitcoin's payments verification system, in which bitcoin is drastically cheaper in humand and machine costs than bank payment networks.
















True enough. Which is why the devs have talked about having backup algs on hand and testing them in advance just in case.
















No, in this case I'm not. Mining may be bruteforcing in a certain sense, but you'll never brutforce an address is what I mean.
















I've heard this before, but I don't understand how you think banks can "drop their prices" to match bitcoin. Banks could match the price of bitcoin only *by losing money* on each transaction. How would that help them, exactly? It would only forestall their eventual destruction and replacement with bitcoin. Should they drop their price below bitcoin it would hasten their destruction even faster.
Their only play in an emergency like that is to match bitcoin's transaction price and lose money while they dump truckloads of bribery money on Washington politicians in hope of obtaining government protection from the big bad bitcoin.
The cost basis of these companies is far in excess of what it costs bitcoin to process transactions, meaning they can't drop their prices down to what bitcoin costs and still make a profit. So I think you're entirely wrong on this point.
I mean, look at Western Union, do you think they can drop their prices to match bitcoin and stay in business? They charge 10% in some parts of Africa, do you think that's an arbitrary number, or that it reflects actual cost of doing business at least to some extent.
















That ignores the buy in from retailers and miners, especially miners, as well as the overall testing of the core technology. A new coin would still require many years of fronting before it could be considered battle hardened and proved. It's not easy to write bulletproof code, everyone knows this. It can be done, but generally it's not worth doing. Except for something like this.
Besides, its small size is part of the reason why we're so bullish on price.
Facebook could start a coin tomorrow, but its actual buy-in would still be much smaller than bitcoin. How many people actually work at Facebook? A million? Nope. And how many of its users would bother. A coin used on by FB and FB within FB is largely useless. This isn't how the network effect works. You need wide and various. FB itself counts essentially as one singular point in a network. You need much more than that.








And yet they tremble.
















But we do see that already. Because bitcoin is cheaper to use, and gaining in value. Whatever the market cap of bitcoin is now, that's value that is not being kept in traditional banking, and that is a threat to them should that trend continue.


Good enough, but not cheaper. And that's a problem for them. If traditional banking had price parity, then good enough would be. But losing the price war is death for traditional banking.

Yes, this is the dream :) People tend to exagerrate the amount of power the government has. Usage by people will ultimately matter more. The fact that the government and its people don't know what to make of bitcoin, don't understand it, didn't believe it would establish itself, didn't believe it had a compelling value proposition--all this has led them to ignore it and now it's too late.
But we only get to do this once in history. All future people will understand cryptocurrency. 
If bitcoin is established now, there's a good chance it will remain for centuries at the very least, as the monetary foundation of society. And things are looking very, very good for that outcome right now.
In the eyes of most of the world decades and centuries from now, those of us alive today and cognizant of bitcoin may have the world's biggest opportunity and be the envy of history to buy bitcoin at its pre-world dominance prices.

The IRS has a reporting requirement for deposits of a certain amount, I think it's $5,000 now. If you consistently deposit say $4,999 then they assume you're trying to avoid their reporting requirement and this becomes proof you're trying to avoid taxes. The banks themselves by law must turn in customers they think might be avoiding reporting requirements in this way. They then freeze your assets (read: seize them).

Not even to mention that the bitcoin mining industry uses literally the world's most efficient computers to process transactions.












It's what happened in BRH2012. 


Do you think companies simply shut down when they can't meet their bills? That's not how business works every time. Sony didn't make a profit for years in a row and still hasn't shut down. How much easier would it be to actually plan for the BRH that you know is coming. Hell, if I were a mining company I'd already be saving bitcoin for it, thus pricing into the BRH ahead of time.


This is like the buttcoin equivalent of some bitcoiner claiming $5,000 / coin in jan 1, 2015. When the BRH comes and miners don't shut down ludicrously as you claim here, I'll come toss it in your face.
RemindMe! 83 weeks. "Happy BRH! Dude says that miners will shut off their machines and the price will be dropping. Let's see."








Miners control some amount of supply, that's all that's required.


They did in BRH2012, so again, you have to explain BRH2012's experience to sustain your thesis. It's possible because they could see it coming and prepare for it. A rational miner should think to save up a good 4 months of operating expenses at least in prep for BRH2016. Your thesis rests on them ignoring that the BRH is even about to happen and doing no prep at all.


Those are called long-term holders (until price-point X).

Again, that logic doesn't work *for currencies*. You don't lose money by buying currency in the same way you lose the $1 you buy an apple for. You can't subsequently trade an apple as the end consumer and it will rot regardless. Not so of bitcoin. Apples are terrible money.


Joe Public buys $50 worth of bitcoin and receives $50 worth of bitcoin with which he can buy $50 worth of *anything*. Thus price doesn't matter. Transaction cost of that purchase might matter, but not the bitcoin price. Bitcoins could be worth $5 billion each and it wouldn't damper their use as currency. $50 of bitcoin at $5 billion each is still $50 worth of bitcoin.
Surely you realize this.


For investors or products generally this is true, for its function as a medium of exchange it's false. 
I'll just assume you're talking about speculators buying it for expected price gains and go from there. Yes, speculators will be concerned about arbitrary price gain.
But this isn't arbitrary, it's price gain caused by the BRH, an event to which there is no going back from.


The BRH should be a "respectable," as you put it, supply change, because it's permanent.
















Not all, just a large portion. You also have to figure in the effect of secondary and tertiary trades using mined bitcoin that wouldn't happen if it doesn't end up there in the first place.


















Of course not. No one's talking about guarantees, only likelihoods. No one knows the future. 
BRH2012 is the only empirical BRH event either of us can reason from. And at least in that event, miner's kept mining.
















Not assuming that at all, that fact creates the current price, whatever it will be. You say this as if I claimed the price would continue to be $300 as it is today, I'm not saying that at all. If the price is $5 on BRH day, it should still tend to double afterwards. From the beginning I've been price agnostic here, don't start pretending I said $300 on BRH day.


Mined bitcoin not being sold are largely irrelevant anyone, they don't figure into supply and thus price.


That's largely immaterial to my question though. I'm asking about the effect of the BRH. Nothing about the BRH is likely to affect demand.
I never said doubling of today's price, only the price at that time.

All you need to know is that bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions, and that online and distanced transactions are likely to increase in the future, not decrease.
I know the former, and the latter is so likely as to be a foregone conclusion, so I have a lot of faith in bitcoin, but it's a reasonable expectation.


People can make reasonable guesses, which is why IPOs get funded. Google launched its IPO at something like $110, and now it's thousands. Because people know Google was making what people wanted to use.

Because there are two kinds of deflation, one quite harmful and one quite beneficial.
One kind of deflation is associated with the deflationary spiral, and is caused by previous instances of high inflation. The way this one works is thus: the state engages in monetary printing to jumpstart the economy (ie: monetary inflation). This creates uneconomic bubbles in various parts of the economy which mask the looming recession using boosts in some sectors of the economy now being propped-up by government spending (ie: Keynesianism).
When that government money tightens up, it's discovered that these bubbles were uneconomic and they begin to fail.
Which causes the government to create monetary inflation to prop them up.
Because they are bubbles created by inflation, if that sluice of money is cut off, to those industries that are bubbling it looks like a lot of their demand has dried up and they're forced to lower prices--ie: catastrophic deflationary spiral. However, a deflationary spiral created by previous monetary inflation.
If left alone the economy will naturally produce a few percentage points of growth in the form of normal price deflation over time, not catastrophic deflationary spirals. We experienced this from 1850 - 1900 in the US.
So deflation caused by central-bank bubble creation is horrible, yes. But it's also avoidable by taking a laissez-faire approach in the first place, and many times when that policy was followed we has short and quick recessions that turned into fantastic growth thereafter.
The inflationary policy of the government stems from wanting to avoid the pain of a recession, yet an economy is a living and dynamic process which has both profits and losses. Trying to avoid the losses just kicks the can down the road to create a sharper recession later on.
Failing and uneconomic businesses should be allowed to fail and their resources directed to those who can put them to better use. This is prevented from happening by continually feeding them credit, to the point where all these companies can barely survive unless fed zero interest rate loans--and that's where we're at today.
However at zero percent, the can cannot be kicked down the road anymore.
That's why they're talking now about negative interest rates and abolishing cash. They can force people to pay negative interest rates only if they abolish cash.
Instead of letting the economy rebalance itself naturally they're going to try to abolish cash. It would be hilarious if it weren't so sad and destructive. If you put this in a novel people would call it the most amazing fiction, yet here we are.

An unjust law is no law at all--it can still be forced on you. That says nothing about its ethical character.










No, it need not be a choice by a group, it can be an individual choice. But rather it's likely people will choose ethical systems that have *group proof*. That's a bit different than what you're trying to say. That is, if a law-set has a lot of adherents, that becomes a social signal that this is a well tested and useful legal system.
In a society of legal choice that would mean something. Currently it means nothing because legal systems are not allowed to compete and individuals do not have an individual choice.
If individuals could choose they'd still rely on experts to build law, but at least they'd have an individual choice. The locus of choice would move from a collective vote to an individual choice--and that would indeed be new and glamorous.








If each person can choose law for themselves in a polycentric system, in what sense can law be "distributed unevenly"? That does not make any sense to me.

Demand keeps the price where it is now. After the halvening, demand remains the same but supply halves.
That is going to have an effect on price, speculators notwithstanding.
It could be a great time for someone to cash out, but who would want to considering what may come.
Miners will be holding their coins because they don't cover operating costs to sell, and will likely be buying at the same time as a hedging function (sell later when prices go up to cover mining costs). This happened last time as well, miners kept mining but stopped selling.
Mathematically, for those mining operations to continue at their current level, the price must very nearly double. We can expect at least a doubled-price within, I'd say, three to six months of the the 2016 halvening.
Because of speculators, this price level might be reached well before the halvening, in which case there may be an exuberrance of mining, some of which will be undercut by a price not reaching sustained heights enough to justify the hashing runup.

They don't 'win' rather regular users are minorly inconvenienced for a time, and in the process by enriching miners, the "attacker" has incentivized the creation of more future mining power, thus strengthening the network, creating competition and more ability to process more transactions / sec.
So while it might create so short term headaches for regular users, my expectation is it would be a self-defeating attack that ultimately makes bitcoin more powerful.
Also be aware that Gavin and the devs can blacklist attacker addresses with a hot fix within hours or less, to lower impact on honest users.
Furthermore old-coin that hasn't been moved for a long time has priority, and it would be hard for an attacker to obtain that much old coin.

Yeah, that would work, same thing. I thought I mentioned signed messages. But by allowing payments to unlock things you can turn it into commerce too.
Without unlock by payment, you'd have to manually receive a payment from someone, verify you got it, then send a signed message to the device to make it function. Why not cut out the middle-man (you).

So most places charge 1% or less now for either buying bitcoin or transferring to fiat.
Which is now being returned to you in the form of lower fees at this retailer.
Besides, this problem isn't an issue at all if we had a closed-loop bitcoin economy where people neither needed nor wanted to go into and out of fiat.

Do you?
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:35:12


No, the opposite. You're not understanding.
The lock ONLY unlocks when the accounts balance is ZERO. The owner of the address then is the only one that can unlock it. If you send me a satoshi, or an entire bitcoin, you're not pissing me off, you're enriching me. If the door is unlocked or open because I'm using it, sending me a satoshi does nothing to me. And if I want it open, I just empty that address.
Similarly, don't you think it would be all sorts of easy to put a minimum balance to trigger? Are you really going to have fun with me if the trigger balance is 5 BTC? I can send 5 btc to myself for practically nothing. But for you to send me 5 btc just for a prank would be unlikely.
An even better means, I can put a wallet seed into my device that matches one I have, that way every time I want to lock or unlock the device, it generates new addresses. Thus, you'll never even know what address it is we're using each time. Good luck pranking me in that case.
There are variously many ways to handle this situation. You could even pre-program the device with a number of addresses as unlock addresses, each of which gets retired on use--an alternative to the wallet-seed idea.
Consider what you're saying and how it could be gotten around a bit.

The US government is illegitimate. To be legitimate it would require consent of the governed. It has no such consent. It remains in power purely out of historical momentum and nothing else. It was never legitimate. This makes all of its actions unethical and thereby criminal. Saying that what it does is legal is no different than a mafia saying it wants its protection money.
Even if you say that the US government has your consent, that could not confer my consent, or that of others. I never agreed to be part of a majority-rules society either.
[Lacking prior consent, its laws are null and void of authority.](








He has been accused of no crime. Rather they've made structuring itself a crime. Which is dumb. Structuring means depositing just under the government's legal reporting limits, which are arbitrarily defined.
This law is just as dumb as civil forfeiture laws whereby just having large amounts of cash on you prove that you're up to no good and officers can seize and keep it. Ridiculous.








Like what, suing the government in a government court? You don't see a conflict of interest in that? How can you get justice from a court which is itself a part of the very entity you're suing? There's no such thing as justice when suing the government in today's legal environment, because the government will not allow itself to be tried in the court of a neutral third party. **The most basic rule of justice is you cannot be a judge in your own case.**
Similarly, leaving the country puts the cart before the horse. If the government is a representative of people then the people precede the state, both in land title and in authority. If consent is withdrawn it is the government that must recede, not the people that must leave.

How do users "simply switch"? Are we talking about running new software?

The government is illegitimate under the premise of its own formation as given in the Declaration of Independence:


If the government does not have my consent, it does not apply to me. Not because the declaration said it, but because I'm a rational adult, and no contractual obligation can be forced on me without my consent no matter who it is that wants to do so.
Would you accept a forced contractual obligation? You would not. There's nothing magical about a group calling itself a government that would allow them to do so either.

Hmm, does seem high, but I can see a few scenarios where people would otherwise have little or no access to bitcoin, but would have access to financial markets and means, and otherwise just want it managed for them.
It's a very good sign that managed bitcoin is trading at a premium for one thing, if also placing a number on just how hard it is to learn to reliably hold bitcoin for yourself.
I'm thinking of rich people in certain countries that wouldn't be able to buy bitcoin and simply aren't going to learn how to use a wallet of their own.

Yes, a physical lock, needs to be internet connected, so it needs a power-source and wifi. This is probably the most limiting factor, but not a bad assumption for the future. 
The basic idea is that rather than relying on a key, you can use the security of the blockchain.

You don't, correct. However you don't need a bank to hold / borrow / lend cash either.
But most people need help *securing* their cash, thus banks. Bitcoin is likely to face the same issue and security is a service people will be willing to pay for.








Not so, banks existed long prior to monetary creation. Do you think there were no banks during the reign of gold and hard money? All this will be is a return to the historical norm, of which the last 70+ years have been an aberration.








You say "act like a bank", but I think that means more than you intend it to mean. The function of a bank is ALSO what I'm talking about, securing money, vetting lenders, etc. You DO NOT need monetary creation to do those things, or for people to need them done.

You have to admit there's at least one connection: miner's supply much of the daily bitcoin sold on exchanges. How will miners react to a BRH? They won't sell bitcoin at a loss, they'll hold them instead. So we'll be facing a shortage of 3600 bitcoin a day after the BRH. How many bitcoin are sold on exchanges each day? And how many of these come from miners? And how many of the secondary and tertiary transactions are previously mined coins?
I honestly don't know, but I assume it's a good portion of them. We could be looking at a 2/3 drop in market offerings without miner's putting their BTC on the markets.








True. But we also have to figure expectations into this, and those expectations are strongly influenced by BRH2012. Which means everyone, including miners, will expect prices to rise strongly.
That could mean a lot of whales trying to sell into strength, or trying to engineer a bear-trap instead. We shall see.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:38:15


Those two have been around forever though. Bitcoin is still early days, it's not even out of beta. We're all pioneers. It would be acceptable. Wasn't long ago we went through the first halvening and no one knew what the fuck would happen.














Maybe, it depends on where the price goes. If the attackers bid up the price of bitcoin by buy lots of it on exchanges in order to facilitate their attack, that wouldn't be true.
















That would necessitate millions of transactions and address creation in the first place, which would be rather easily observable. And they'd be likely to do it with dust, don't you think, which could be easily rule-avoided by miners, which can create mandatory transaction minimums which would foil such an attack but not affect most transactions which are for more than a few dollars typically.


Do you remember when there was a hard-fork and the devs used a little known feature built into the client? The ability to send a pop-up message to all people running nodes. They used this to notify everyone of a new client update designed to limit the fork from spreading, and it worked.
They could use such a feature again to foil an attack, clearly miners would have incentive to help prevent the network from being successfully attacked. I think you're not giving the existing system enough credit.
















I'm honestly not sure, but I sincerely doubt any attacker could sustain any attack with $10 transactions. It would more likely be them sending dust with a just slightly above the standard transaction fee, in order to minimize cost and maximize number of transactions, and miners could easily respond by prioritizing non-dust transactions.
And if I recall, there is anti-dust protection built in already in some form, so perhaps they wouldn't be able to use dust. But look into how 'days destroyed' functions work. Old bitcoin that hasn't been moved in a long time has transaction priority.
If the attacker didn't keep moving the same bitcoin back and for algorithmically the only alternative would be to buy a large amount of bitcoin on the market, which would cause the price to skyrocket, which would cause mining power to instantly jump--there's a lot of stalled mining power out there that would suddenly become profitable.

The reason banks used to pay a % on savings accounts was because they were implicitly using your money to make money, via loan lending, both homes and credit cards, or various forms of more liquid investment.
However many people don't actually realize this and think money in a savings account is "money in the bank." 
What should actually happen is that money being saved should be put more like in a CD, where it becomes unavailable for a time to reflect it's being tied up in an actual investment outside the bank itself.








Without a government in place to legitimate such activity, they'd have to make sure they've got their ducks in a row contractually, which means you'd have to be informed and consent to it. I'm speaking, of course, from a libertarian perspective. If it's just bitcoin in our current US system of coercive law, this kind of fraud is already legal for banks to engage in.








That's why banks charge fees on those accounts, because they're expected to have money moving out of them rapidly, and they can't lend out that amount that won't be there stably for awhile at least.
And yes, it most likely means you'd pay *in some way*, although that way could be non-monetary, like forms of advertising or the like.

Why then did the world coalesce around gold prior to government-forced money.
Read Peter Surda's 2012 thesis on bitcoin, he explains from an economic point of view why the network effect and path dependence, two economic concepts, will continue to drive people into bitcoin adoption and away from alt-coins. This reduces transaction costs for everyone involved, and the network effect makes bitcoin more valuable the more bitcoin adopt into the bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin has long since had critical mass on that front, and the fate of all other crypto-coins is to slot into bitcoin as a sidechain or else face irrelevance long-term.
So you see, I do not speak merely from force of personality but has good reasons for my statement.
For any altcoin to challenge bitcoin it would have to do something bitcoin cannot do. But since they're all digital cryptocoins, all bound by the same limitations, that's essentially impossible.
No one would trust any new solution that wasn't open-source, and if they open-source it, it could be adopted into bitcoin, if it ended up being that important and integral.
Thus, bitcoin can crush like a bug any upstart that comes close to threatening its dominance, and everyone in the world has incentive to see this happen, due to the network effect.
So, again, and we've been saying this for four years now, no altcoins has a reasonable chance of supplanting bitcoin any time soon.
Regular companies do not function the way a currency does. Currency does not get used up when it is used, like products and services do. It operates on different rules, as a medium of exchange, not the thing to be exchanged itself.

Use a bit more imagination. You know how multibit (or w/e) uses a wallet seed to deterministically create new wallet addresses, you could synchronize with a wallet to create a private, yet still blockchain-aware, physical device that had a new address every time it was used.
Every time you pay into the proper address it switches to the new address deterministically using the known seed. If you have that seed too--which obviously you do, it's your device--then you too switch to the new address.
Don't just spout negativism, consider your own challenge first and how it could be overcome.

Correct, but they were used because gold was so rare that trying to subdivide it down to the level of pennies would've made it nearly microscopic. It had everything to do with practical use considerations.
This problem does not exist with bitcoin, it can subdivide without limit. There will be no silver to bitcoin.
















Again, anything another could come up with could be patched into bitcoin, because they're both cryptocoins.


And yet the effects I'm talking about have still made bitcoin dominant, and will continue to as new people jump aboard. The network effect says that the network grows more valuable as people join it. New people will join the most valuable network. It's self-reinforcing.
















True, but people on the whole vastly prefer one of those over the other. Ie: both are not advantages.
Dogecoin found this out the hard way by trying to go perma-inflationary, and it largely died out soon after.


Yeah, those people are wrong. In actual practice they would come to prefer bitcoin against their belief anyway. That's how such things work. That's why socialists live successfully in capitalist society.


A privacy focus is likely a viable sidechain. I don't think it would supersede bitcoin though.




















Yet when it came to value, multiple cultures around the world all independently centered on gold. For a reason.
















The kinds of things companies did then can be done again, mainly scrip backed by gold. They would again issue scrip backed by bitcoin. Like Amazon bucks and Microsoft money. No big deal.

The dollar--any currency--is always one authoritarian demagogue away from hyperinflation.
With bitcoin, this risk is forever eliminated. It is a currency for the ages.
And while bitcoin may have price swings, they are not controlled by any single person in the same way the Bolivar is today being corrupted.
This is called *existential risk*.
The dollar, and all fiat, has a high existential risk because it is human controlled, because the supply of dollars can be expanded without limit, at will. The fed could print a sextillion dollars tomorrow and none of us could stop it. Obama could mint the trillion dollar coin the day after, and the dollar would be made useless shortly thereafter.
But this is impossible in the bitcoin economy. Much less existential risk, much less trust in human beings being rational, sensible, and non-exploitative.

No. Again, I'm not talking about regular brute-force, but rather quantum computing. No address is conventionally brute-forceable. But all addresses made in the first 2 years of bitcoin's history expose the true address, whereas addresses after the patch do not as long as they aren't spent from. 
This creates two kinds of addresses, those early ones that are quantum-vulnerable, and current ones that are not--as long as they are not spent from.

No. You craft a transaction using the 'send' tab, using the watch-only wallet. Now obviously you cannot actually send bitcoin this way because the private key is missing from this wallet. But you can at least initiate the transaction from here.
Hit 'preview' after you put in the address, amount, and fees, and it will give you the option to save the transaction.
Save it, move the file to the offline pc, put the private key into electrum THERE, load and sign the transaction offline, then save that signed transaction, move back to the online PC and load/broadcast the transaction.
The goal is never to expose your private key to online.

They use the same blockchain for one thing. There's no altcoin that uses the same blockchain and then takes it over if consensus is achieved.
A hard fork is not an altcoin and it was a ridiculous charge of the opposition in the first place. It was a smear intended to rationalize their opposition.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:24:46




This confuses the issue, since you can run an XT node today and still be running bitcoin, same blockchain and functionality and all, nothing changed in the slightest, until the day that consensus is reached, if that day arrives. This proves that the two are not incompatible at all.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:21:08
Yes they do. You sound like a propagandist.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:22:02
If it was a stock, yeah.
But it's a currency that's gaining value because people have discovered it's far better than any other currency, and we're in the middle of a paradigm change from fiat money to cryptocurrency.
Paradigm changes regularly come with gigantic value discovery for the people who got in early. Microsoft's early employees are all millionaires, over a thousand millionaires made in Microsoft. Was that a bubble? 
Context matters, this isn't some ponzi scheme, it's a completely new way of doing business that people have begun to realize will form the backbone of all future finance.
Today in bitcoin is a bit more like being in an early revolutionary tech company. Shares start out at a zero price, and the public only becomes aware of them upon IPO, generally. If you did the math of Google shares from zero price, you'd fine similar giant returns until it found its market balance price. We are likely nowhere near the balance price for bitcoin, we haven't even had the bitcoin equivalent of the IPO yet, Wall St has not yet had a chance to buy in.
Which is pretty nuts to think about given today's prices.

Dear u/Comboy, I have a request. Love your chart-site, been watching it since it was $26. But I have a request:
Would you enable a button that automatically sounds an alarm (just once!) every time a new "All Time High" is reached?
Right now, to get notified, I have to manually set the price alarm to $1 above the existing all-time-high and when it goes off, it goes off until I kill it, potentially for hours if I'm not there.
This would be a killer feature!

@_date: 2017-11-05 21:03:32


Well of course it's going to do *that* :P
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:30:43
Say X went long on bitcoin by +$200 and his futures contract is coming due, but the price is static.
Should he just pay the losses, or will he buy enough bitcoin to raise the price by $200 so he can break even on the contract and still theoretically sell bitcoin at that price attaining a zero-loss.
Alternately, anyone who wants to try this same strategy on the short side must *already have bitcoin to sell*, which is actually harder than buying.
So say they short -$200 on the price but the price is static and their contract is coming due. 
So they sell enough bitcoin to bring the price down $200 and offset the expected loss.
These numbers are obviously really inflated from a realistic scenario, and there are all sorts of ways to counter-game people trying these things that tend to cancel out. 
If you see the order book has a gigantic amount of shorts coming due soon, you realize there may be selling pressure and so you setup a large amount of stop orders under the current price to soak up anyone trying to flood the market with cheap bitcoin.
And on the other side, if they try to buy tons of bitcoin, you can setup large limit orders that soak-up their funds without significantly raising the price.
It becomes a huge game of who has more assets and can bully the other guy. The whales throw their weight around and can often win that way, but sometimes they get epically burned, like the legend of Bearwhale back in 2013/2014.
The overall effect of all these people trying to game each other is a reduction in volatility and an increase in liquidity, both good effects.
That's the theory anyway. Bitcoin is still a pretty small market and we might see a couple more years of volatility until things settle down as the land-rush into bitcoin investment creates interesting effects.

Create a 'watch only' address on online computer. Send bitcoin to someone using this wallet and save the transaction to a file.

Yes. There are two types of gold on earth, gold that was with the earth when it formed in the solar system, and gold that came from asteroid strikes.
Gold that formed with the earth itself is all locked in the core of the earth and completely unavailable. Even magma doesn't have any of this gold.
Asteroid strike gold is all other gold, including everything humans have mined. Even the stuff being talked about in the link you provided.

Thing is, the fear that people used to express about it going to zero has been melting away, because even institutional people are admitting blockchain has real utility, and bitcoin does by extension obviously.
It used to be that you had to have a heavy background in economics and monetary theory to reasonably have faith that bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general was actually going to go anywhere.
Now, all you have to do is listen to the experts who have already had a few years to challenge their preconceived notions and integrate the ideas of what cryptocurrency actually is and are putting their own reputation behind positive statements about it.
We are almost at the tipping point, in fact this price rise is surely the leading edge of that tipping point.

Yep, it's a hard-fork for anything under a satoshi. A single bitcoin on the protocol level is counted as 100 million satoshis, to go with more zeroes the protocol needs to be updated. Hard fork. No way around it.
On the plus side, should not be controversial, so we would easily obtain 95%+ support, I would expect.
But part of the reason why silver was more commonly used than gold as a money was because gold could not be divided physically into dollar sized coins once gold got so valuable. We shouldn't let that happen to bitcoin.

A satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin. It is **currently** the smallest unit of a bitcoin.
Obviously if we further subdivide bitcoin, it would *no longer be* the smallest unit of bitcoin.
A satoshi is not defined by being the smallest unit of bitcoin, it is defined by a specific fraction: 1/100,000,000th.
Satoshis would continue to be defined as 1/100,000,000th even if we subdivided the currency. 
You can't seem to get this simple fact through your head. This is why everyone is calling you an idiot.


Dead wrong. This is the central reason you've been so wrong on this issue, this is a false belief.








Yes it is, read this link this time:






































You could run the entire world economy on one bitcoin, but only through subdivision AND the resulting price gain of a single bitcoin, because this does not create inflation.

The S curve of course does top out at some future point, but there are likely multiple S curves for bitcoin at different points in its lifespan. Just last year we had a mini one from 400 to $700+ at the Halvening. Each can be said to be a function of different segments of society realizing there's value here and buying in, with some fraction of them becoming long-term hodlers, naturally.
We haven't hit the Wall St. S-curve yet, that will be the big one, the IPO moment, and when that levels off we will have a years to go yet before it arrives at a final price-discovery level.
It's entirely likely that there's a lot of growth ahead of us, which is why the price is rising rapidly now as more realize this, and realize what's coming. Wall St hasn't bought in yet, maybe privately bbut not institutionally, banks have not bought in yet, central banks have not bought in yet. We've seen articles in which central bank governors have said they may soon need to buy a certain amount of bitcoin to protect their currencies from currency-based speculation attacks.
And when you ask how much bitcoin they might end up holding, each, the figure is something like 100 bitcoin they might be able to afford by the time it comes to this happening.
Anyway, the problem with bitcoin has always been how to express its promise without sounding like a wild-eyed lunatic just trying to pump a fad.
That's much less a problem now than it was before, but the promise of bitcoin has not changed.
This is a paradigm shift, the arrival of a new asset class, all of that. All bets are off the table.

Because **no new bitcoin has been created**.
Think about it like pie. If I have ONE PIE and I cut it into 10 pieces, did I create new pie? Is there PIE INFLATION?
No, there is still one pie, and also 1/10th pie slices.
If we **subdivide** the satoshi into 10 pieces or 100 pieces or whatever, **we have not created new satoshis, nor any new bitcoin**.
You caveat doesn't matter whatsoever.

Actually this future will end up happening, but by a different means entirely. We will begin to generate large amounts of gold and other precious metals through the mining of asteroids, believe it or not.
It's estimated that just a single metals-rich asteroid has as much gold on it as has been mined on earth in all of human history.
Which means that gold, long term, is set to become very much less valuable, because there are literally *millions* of asteroids like that up there waiting to be mined, and there are already several asteroid-mining companies in existence planning to get to the first one within 15 years.

China has pretensions to be the next world reserve currency, they think just having their 1 billion people numbers will make it happen. They're probably wrong. No one trusts them enough to accept their currency, it's still a one-party dictatorship effectively in China.
Beyond that, China would settle for knocking the US out of the reserve spot even if they cannot get into it.
That could leave space for bitcoin to become a new reserve. If that happen, we'll be leaving the galaxy. Central banks in every country will feel the need to purchase large amounts of bitcoin to protect themselves from currency-based attacks, and that would be a land-rush into bitcoin, first in wins big, last one in loses.

Subdivision does not create more satoshis, why do you not understand this? Is english not your first language???


A bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis, or 1 billion deca-satoshis, it's still a bitcoin. We've subdivided the satoshi by ten in this scenario--we didn't create any new bitcoin or new satoshis.


Yes it is.


Wrong. If you change the sub-division, a satoshi is still worth the same value it was before the sub-division.

Of course he is, because you don't know what you're talking about.
A satoshi is not just the lowest unit of the currency, it's a specific fraction. If you divide a satoshi into 10 units, creating deca-satoshis, have you created any new satoshis?
Of course not.

Irrelevant to whether division creates inflation. I have no idea why you keep saying this as if it meant anything.








Wrong, a satoshi is a specific fraction that does not change, it is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin it is not 1/100th of a bitcoin. 
See here:












No it doesn't. You seem to think the definition of a satoshi can change or is some changing fraction. You've offered no reasons why you think this and this is why everyone's calling you a moron and dead wrong about this entire issue.








Wrong, pre-division and post-division, the value of a satoshi would not change. We would just be able to divide a satoshi up more than we could before. And we'd give this new unit a new name, like a deca-satoshi or something.
**Cutting the pie into 10 slices does not give us more pie .:. cutting the satoshi into 10 pieces does not give us more satoshis.**

The word you're looking for is existential risk.
Tomorrow, literally tomorrow, the central banks of the world could band together and decide to dump the dollar, and the dollar would be destroyed overnight.
Now this is unlikely to happen because it would be against their interests, but those who control the dollar still abuse this situation by exporting inflation to holders of dollars.
The fact that it's possible but unlikely is existential risk.
Bitcoin's existential risk is perhaps orders of magnitude lower than the dollar's, or other currencies, because there's no one or a few personalities that could financially punish you through their decisions.
So sure, there's been a 60% price drop in bitcoin, but it's not because of some central agency printing more bitcoin--which is what causes fiat currencies to drop. It's something entirely other, mere supply and demand, and should be considered entirely normal at this point in bitcoin's lifecycle.
If bitcoin were on equal footing with other fiat currencies, meaning being used on a wide basis as part of a daily national or international economy, would we see 60% price drops? Of course not. 
This has far more to do with bitcoin's youth than anything, and thus no, I'm not worried. And again, such figures quote the short term and ignore the long term, which is volatility trending upwards.

Volatility also looks higher depending on what your unit of account is.
If your unit of account is dollars, the Japanese yen looks far more volatile than if your unit of account is the yen and you're looking at dollars.
If bitcoin becomes a native currency, a unit of account, its internal volatility will automatically reduce from that effect. Instead other currencies become the volatile ones.
If we all have bitcoin as out unit of account, it would look like the US dollar is losing value rapidly and US-produced goods getting dramatically cheaper to us, in the same way that foreign goods do when their currencies drop.
But if our suppliers wanted to be paid in bitcoin and our customers wanted to pay in bitcoin, the bitcoin volatility would be greatly reduced.
Volatility then is partly a relative concept.

And I do.








It *would* be foolish to keep large amounts of bitcoin on a simple computer. Luckily there are far more secure ways to hold bitcoin, ie: paper wallets, and no one should fear that.
Long term it's going to be hardware wallets that take the pain out of this area.
















That's not the same thing as devaluation. That's not the creation of new bitcoin overnight, that is simply the selling of already existing bitcoin. This is not what happens when a state devalues their currency; when that happens they print mass quantities of **new money**--this cannot happen with bitcoin.
















Not by law, not by whim, but by their own mistake. Apples to oranges.
















Which human? You're wrong. If you go use the Venezuelan peso, the value of that peso is up to the whim of Maduro. Period. Which is why it's currently inflating at 600% a year.
**This can never happen with bitcoin.** 
No one can just decide to print a few million bitcoin overnight. You're deliberately missing the point in all of these.
































And you think that same mode isn't possible with bitcoin? You think bitcoin-based credit cards can't happen? People get their credit card details stolen quite easily as well. I would worry far more about that than bitcoin in my coldwallet being stolen.
The first time I applied for a credit card at age 19 it was delivered to the wrong house, the people there stole the card, activated it, maxed it out, sent bad checks to keep the game going, and when I finally figured out it was long overdue and made calls it was too late to disclaim the transactions. Took me 7 years to clean that off my record. Turned out to be a good lesson.
This can never happen with bitcoin. And what's more, there's no age limit of bitcoin, so today the youth are using bitcoin because they cannot get their hands on credit cards. That could become a seachange in time.

Nah, conf time is rarely an issue. Transactions go through instantly and only for high value items like car, houses, etc., would you need to wait an hour for 6 confs. And those kinds of transactions already take longer than that to perform, so it seems to be rarely an issue. 
If the core devs thought that was a killer feature it would already be patched into bitcoin, but it's just not necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:05:22


You should not re-use public keys ever. Key-reuse is not quantum safe.








Setup a watch-only wallet on your online PC, create a transaction, save it, move it to your offline pc with electrum, load and sign the transaction with your private key, save it and move it back to online pc, load and broadcast. Done.
There's an electrum bug though, you have to manually start it in offline mode, otherwise it will try to connect to the web and refuse to sign.
To do this, instead of starting electrum using the icon, start a terminal and type:
electrum --offline
This will start electrum in offline mode and allow you to sign the transaction without getting the 'can't find server' error.








The best way is to use QR codes and a webcam. When you create a transaction on the online electrum, hit 'preview' and it will show you the transaction. Check all balances and address, then there's a little QR code button in the corner, hit that and it will pop up a QR code.
If you have electrum running on the offline machine, you can hit 'tools&gt;load transaction from QR' and it will start the webcam and read the QR code on the screen and load that as the transaction, allowing you to sign.
It helps if you have two monitors.








Most people will use a USB to save the transaction to, but this is less secure than a QR code.

A good money is: 
- **Compact**. You can fit a lot of wealth into a little gold, unlike, say, silver, much less copper and others.
Bitcoin is far more compact however, each unit takes up no more space than the first one in a wallet. You could store entire galaxies worth of wealth in virtually the same physical space as a single satoshi.
- **Easily verifiable**. Gold's yellow color and unusual weight made this possible. However gold has had its fraud scandals too, with gold-plated bars covering cadmium and tungsten. Also it's difficult to train a merchant to take gold, several tests must be run to be sure the mass, volume, and weight correlate to 100% gold. Here's a great example of using a [gold-coin gage]( to prove gold is good. Imagine trying to train someone to do that, with a thousand dollars on the line if they're wrong, and they're working for minimum wage.
Bitcoin's cryptographic verification is 100%, it either works or doesn't, and cannot be faked.
- **Fungible:** each piece of gold is identical to the others, and equal in worth.
Each bitcoin is certainly fungible as well
- **Incorruptible**: it should be able to store for a long time in any conditions without rusting, breaking down, etc. Gold, which won't oxidize, is beautiful for this. Bitcoin is better for several reasons. 
- **Rare:** Here gold begins to break down. Gold is rare only on earth; there are multiples of what we have no on other planets and especially in the asteroids that we will begin mining this century. A single metals-rich asteroid has more gold on it than has been mined in all of human history, and there are thousands and thousands of these out there waiting. Gold's rarity is an illusion.
Bitcoin's rarity, however, is a guarantee. Not another bitcoin will be found in the entire universe outside earth.
--- 
Where gold still beats bitcoin is in its long history which makes it really well known, and the large number of people that would be willing to accept a gold payment if push came to shove, and the analog nature of gold.

Not really. He's referring to the peace that comes from not having to trust any person for the safety of your wealth. No one can devalue bitcoin overnight like what Venezuela and Argentina are suffering through. No one can steal bitcoin out of your wallet, such as Cyprus and likely soon Greece will go through. No one can tell you who you can and cannot send bitcoin to, etc.
When your wealth is contingent on human whim, that's worry. When wealth is secured by pure and impersonal math, that's security and mental peace.
But he could mean at least one other thing, that nations finance wars through borrowing. Bitcoin would make that far harder, far more expensive, and thus a world where bitcoin rules should be a more peaceful world.

What one crypto-coin can do another crypto-coin can do. I don't see that as an issue at all. All newspapers can do what other newspapers can do, all tv shows can do what other tv shows can do. The real competition is between newspapers and tv shows which each can do something the other cannot.
Any feature another crypto-coin could produce that's killer could be patched into bitcoin, and its method would have to be revealed (open-sourced) because no one will trust an altcoin that hasn't open-sourced its code. Bitcoin will simply crush that altcoin like a bug at that point.
Altcoins therefore should focus on becoming sidechains, meaning useful for something that isn't payments but piggybacks on bitcoin, such as Namecoin, escrow, or privacy as in Darkwallet, etc.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:48:31
I just think people, regardless of what they believe, will realize there's value in a decentralized currency with minimum trust needed.
Of course centralized providers can do it faster and cheaper--but if that was all there was, then bitcoin should never have gotten off the ground at all. It's the trustlessness of bitcoin, the immutable ledger, the freedom from political control that gives bitcoin a large part of its value, and which isn't going anywhere, because to change those aspects would harm bitcoin significantly, and thus be against everyone's interests, especially miners. They don't need to be of any particular ideology to feel that intuitively.
For bitcoin to become a worldwide payment rail is possible, with more centralized sidechains using it as a settlement layer--that scenario at least realistically addresses the transaction-per-second problem. With sidechains you can multiply the TPS by the TPS of each sidechain, achieving exponentially more TPS, with each sidechain doing a settlement every hour, every day, every week, whatever.
That is a recipe for an expansion of bitcoin virtually without limit. I don't see how it happens apart from that.
But don't mistake me as part of the "bitcoin = settlement layer" camp either necessarily.

We've already got the tech to capture asteroids sans emdrive using gravity-capture. The first one will take years to capture.
But the fact that capture is in progress will allow them to rationalize investing in an orbital smelting plant using sunlight. That will cost a few billion--that's the real barrier right there. But it's doable.
Once we have that, we can mine, smelt, and build in space on the cheap. Then the [space revolution](really kicks off.
I'd say 10 years until someone tries or announces a try. I think Elon Musk intends to do it as soon as SpaceX is reliable enough. A single metals-rich asteroid can have $10 trillion worth of materials inside it. I'd invest in that.
But yeah, if the EMdrive pans out, that would turn it into something we could expect to see much, much sooner than before. I sincerely hope it does pan out, that will be incredible.

The way gold has been manipulated is by selling shares in future mining (mining that will never actually happen btw).
By this means, they have sold 300 times more theoretical future gold than actually exist as mined gold.
That's a considerable manipulation of the price, and keeps the price of gold very low, since paper-gold is treated as equivalent to actual gold, even though actual mining has been tapering down in the last decades and that much gold can in fact never be mined--not on earth anyway (perhaps asteroids have that much gold).
So the question is could this same method be used to sell paper bitcoin?
I don't see how it could be, for a couple reasons.
One, everyone knows there's a mathematical hard limit on the number of bitcoin that exist. Even if someone tried to sell future paper mining in bitcoin, that total still would have to not exceed the 21 million hardcap, or else you'd get a run on redemptions.
So you could never see that 300 times multiplier that is holding down the price of gold.
Secondly, so-called 'paper bitcoin' wouldn't be transactable within the bitcoin network itself, since it's only theoretical bitcoin, and only actual bitcoin can be stuffed into a block as a chain-recorded transaction. So if and when the economy shifts increasingly towards bitcoin as a unit of account, paper-bitcoin would become increasingly irrelevant. Paper gold was so easy to slip into the market as a gold-substitute because gold was *already* being transacted on paper as a mere claim to an amount of gold held in some other location. So it was easy to substitute one slip of paper for another slip of paper, but this doesn't work in bitcoin. There's no need or use for scrip or fiat in the bitcoin world, bitcoin transacts directly.
And what incentive would there be to sell future mined bitcoin when we don't have anything like price stability and everyone still expects the price to rise dramatically in the coming years and even decades. Selling paper bitcoin mining shares is probably only viable after bitcoin has reached its market saturation price, whatever that is. Gold has, naturally, long since done that.
Lastly, the ability to sell paper-gold is based on the sure ownership of an actual gold mine, which is mainly a function of ownership. But the ownership of a bitcoin mine is significantly less sure, it's not a plot of land you can just show ownership of. So selling mining years into the future is inherently a more risky prospect considering all that could happen in that time, not only to bitcoin but to your mining operation itself. Perhaps a new more efficient mining chip is created that blows your operation out of the water and makes it unprofitable, now you can't deliver mined bitcoin in advance.

If Klein put them into an encrypted wallet, it's likely no one will spend those coins until quantum cryptography begins freeing them up. 
Coins mined in the first two years of bitcoin's existence are not safe from quantum attack.
I have long said that Satoshi's bitcoin are a quantum canary. Once we see them begin moving, we will now that someone in the world has a functioning advanced quantum computer. 
It's just too big a prize not to be the first thing that you do with a QC. I would even expect governments employees to try this if they had access.
If, on the other hand, we see all Satoshi coins move at once, that means someone has the private key.
Because Satoshi kept each 50 BTC distribution from his mining in a separate wallet. And even QC takes a lot of time to crack even those early wallets. Months or longer I would expect.
The other possibility is that someone with a QC could crack wallets and then not move the bitcoin, waiting to move it all later. But this is unlikely because they must fear that someone else is attempting the same thing and could beat them to the punch if they wait.
So, if we see say 5 or 10 Satoshi wallets move all at once, then that should also be considered a QC event as well. 10 wallets, randomly chosen from the Satoshi blocks, would not be a huge risk to wait to move.
The point in waiting is that the minute a Satoshi block moves, the market will react very negatively, because we can expect those coins to be freed up and reach the markets, bringing the price down.
So, whoever first has a QC and begins targeting bitcoin, they will move those coins and sell them quickly.
Then the sh!t will hit the fan.
I wonder how the devs will react then. Should we move to lock down those early coins so they cannot be stolen? Historically the devs have opted against such things.

You have to undersstand the theory of money and why people use money at all. Think of why people like and use money rather than just trading goods via barter. 
Money creates a significant value for people by eliminating what's called the double-coincident of wants requirement, whereby if you want to buy shoes but you're a chicken farmer, you have to find a shoemaker who wants enough chicken to barter shoes for.
Money abstracts value away from specific needs.
To do this, money requires certain qualities, like rareness, doesn't rust-away, fungibility, easy verifiability, etc., etc. For a very long time, the best money we had was *gold and silver*. 
Then came the digital age, started in our lifetime. Money of course would be impacted by this in time, and the cypherpunks were busy working on concepts to do it, for literally decades.
Finally with the key breakthrough idea of the blockchain, it was doable, and this who experiment launched.
As a money, cryptocurrencies have all the attributes that you want in a good money, the same attributes that gold and silver had, *but also a few more attributes that no physical money could ever have*.
Like the ability to send value at the speed of light, or store large amounts of value digitally. You can't send gold through an electronic message.
Combine that with the abandonment of good precious-metals moneys and the modern nation-state rent-seeking BIG TIME on their control of currency, now divorced from the constraints of reality by being unbacked, and you have a hardcore NEED for a better currency.
Governments have easily shutdown attempts to move to other physical currencies, but have failed to shutdown the emergence of P2P networks. So the answer is a P2P currency, bitcoin.
There is a large amount of pent-up demand for a good currency, which is why gold and silver collecting has remained a thing, despite governments doing their best to prevent gold from coming back.
Gold prices have been literally controlled by the governments of the world. There is 300 times more paper-gold than actual gold in the world, all to destroy the value of gold and keep gold from becoming a hedge against inflation.
Can they do that with bitcoin? Not likely.
So the simple fact is that bitcoin has value because it has the same attributes that gives gold value. In fact, of the price of gold, it's estimated that just 10% of its value is actual use value as gold in things like jewelry and industry, the rest is value-store value and monetary value.
Bitcoin, being non-physical, has a vanishingly small use value: some disk-space and electricity. But it's value-store value is enormous, because no government and no one can issue new bitcoin. So you have the best surety in the world, compared to ANY other currency, that bitcoin will retain value long term.
And these are very uncertain economic times, and the government is responding to these uncertain times *by printing new money*.
In fact, governments obtain a very large amount of value, money, and power, by inflating the currency, and US government more than all the others. And they have conspired to *inflate at the same rate* so that their currencies do not gain or lose value relative to each other.
I won't even talk about how living in a country where the currency is inflating puts negative pressures on prices and product quality and causes everything to tend to get cheaper and worse over time, instead of better and better.
If we can build a non-state society using a deflationary money, the reverse will be true. We will live in a society where deflation causes upward *quality pressure* rather than today's opposite, because prices always want to be sticky. Sticky prices means retailers don't want to change the price. But if your currency is inflating, the ingredients are getting more expensive. Businesses don't want to raise the price to reflect that, so instead we get sneaky ways to make the product cheaper. Like ice-cream that's 50% air, for instance, and cookies that increasingly rely on transfats and carbs, etc.
In a deflationary economy, sticky prices and deflating currency means that the product prices are always appearing more expensive, and the businesses love this and don't want to lower prices, even though the cost of the ingredients that go into them is constantly going down. So instead, they will tend to increase the quality of the ingredients to justify the continued price.
What a world to live in that would be. I can hardly wait.

I should mention that a possibly more tempting first QC project could be an exchange that is reusing a cold-wallet over and over. Once you've spent from a modern address, it is no longer quantum-safe, which is why the default behavior of bitcoin was never to re-use addresses.
This could net a crook thousands of bitcoin potentially. But I'm not sure if anyone with a large address is actually reusing that address.
Likely there is *someone* doing it, but that person is a fool.

But the weakness seems to be the need for a thumbstick to move the transaction from the airgapped computer to the connected computer.
Can this be ameliorated by using a brand-new thumbstick the first time it's used being with the Tails computer, or do you have to start the transaction on the connected computer then move it to the Tails computer to be signed, then bring it back to the connected-comp? That seems less secure, since there is a communication vector in there still, however remote.

Remember when Google was working on the that phone made of modular modules that could be mixed and matched.
They likely nixxed it because the government told them to stop, because it would allow people like us to put encryption modules on the phone and break their snooping monopoly.
We need to revive that project outside the tamed-corporate sector and then we can do this kind of thing.
Alternately, phones still take microSD cards, if we can integrate this function into one of those you might have something.

It's actually something that people would love to do in regular programming, but the number of possible states is too large. They do however to quite a bit of state checking, things like Monte Carlo simulation.
It seems here that by limiting the aspects of the language that make it hard to compute all states, they create it with some functions where all states can be computed.
If you can compute all states, you can prove 100% safe.

At the 2016 Halvening, I attended a Halvening party where we counted down to the final block, drank and traded stories. It was a super nerdy room, with doge hats and tech t-shirts and even a few legit neckbeards.
Anyway, one of the most common topics was projections, "What do you think the price will be in 2020 at the next Halvening."
At the time, the price had been around $400 shortly before the Halvening, and I said I'd be happy to see $4000 in 2020.
People thought I was crazy.
Quite happy to have seen $4k only a year later! Surpassing my expectations. But hey, that's exponential growth for you.

Pretty sure if you bought it you've already paid the price.

People are bad at estimating the effects and speed of exponential change. Bitcoin is moving .062% of what JPMorgan does daily. Great. How many doubling period is that until bitcoin eats your lunch? Four doubling periods to 1%, alright, we're almost done.
At 11 doubling periods bitcoin will be doing 26% more daily transactions than JPMorgan. This is how exponential curves work.

[Bitcoin users double every 12 months](

Not a chance. I hear people say this but it's simply not true, you're ignoring a lot. Firstly, number of people who speak a language is not what makes it a world language. Chinese has the numbers, but it's all concentrated at home. English is spoken worldwide.
Chinese is also one of the most difficult languages in the entire world to learn an to speak and to read. That alone precludes it from ever being a world trade language, barring all else.
You have to realize that english was literally created as a trade language, because it is the intersection of old german and french. And large numbers of foreigners picked up the language early in its history and completely changed the language, known as the 'great vowel shift.'
The result was to greatly *simplify* english as a spoken language. It lost all all of the gender constructions that complicates french and latin, and the really hard to pronounce aspects were worn away as well by the new speakers in large numbers who simply couldn't master these features, and today they are lost entirely.
Then english became a world trade language through the British trade empire, and is a primary language in many countries, including India.
Written english is still a bit difficult due to certain do-gooders who tried to force Latin spelling rules on written english. Perhaps we can make written english phoenetic someday, but probably won't need to.
But Chinese? It will never happen. 
You'd need something like what happened to english to happen to Chinese. China would have to be conquered by and interbred with a large number of foreigners, producing a third language between them.
But that's not going to happen.
In all the word the top two hardest languages may be Polish and Chinese. And they can prove this scientifically by measuring at what age an average child born into that society is able to completely master speaking the language.
For english, it's the low end of the scale, children completely master english by age 9.
For Polish and Chinese, it's age 11-13 or so. 
These are tough, tough languages, and they will *never* become world languages because of that. I doubt any *tonal language* could become a world language without sacrificing that feature, much as english got rid of gender.
Anecdotally I like the story of a guy I read about who decided to learn Chinese. He spent the next three years diligently studying the language daily, but by the end of that period had become frustrated, he still could not do much in Chinese, and could not even read a newspaper.
He was dismayed to pick up a Spanish newspaper on the plane and read an article and was able to make more sense out of it than a Chinese news article, despite having never studied spanish.
And as for the Chinese economy, it's a paper tiger, a mirage. They've accumulated $20 trillion in debt in the last 20 years, and much of the growth they've posted has been false and unsustainable. China's ghost cities are legendary. Their economy has slowed considerably in the last few years.
And english is not a 'shit language,' that's very offensive and wrong. How can you even know of the existence of Shakespeare and the like and think this, there are millions of great cultural works done in english.
And if you want to know what the second most likely trade language would be, it would likely be french, not spanish, although spanish is close.
But never, never Chinese. Nor Polish.
And lol at esperanto.

Really any hard and relatively liquid asset will benefit from a global default. Gold will be among the winners, undoubtedly too property, art, precious-metals variously, and other commodities. But the less liquid ones will be less sought. Bitcoin is potentially more liquid than gold. Certainly easier to transact in bitcoin than in gold.

Gold will likely never become a transactional currency again, however. It may remain a reserve commodity / value store for awhile longer.

Not really. First of all, Swiss account pull requirements are 1-3 months. Secondly the central bank is able to print cash within a matter of days of essentially any amount to cover withdrawals like this--that's part of its mandate. Central banks do this all the time. There's some famous cases of the Fed sending hundreds of millions *overnight* to various parts of the country where a bank run was feared, historically. Switzerland is a far smaller country too.
Literally any amount should be producible in cash by any central bank in the world within a week.

There's even a Harvard economist running around saying that we need to ban cash because he expects the new normal to be negative interest rates, and cash allows people to escape the interest cost, which foils their intended effect of trying to pump the economy by "encouraging" people to remove their funds from banks and, implicitly, to spend it as soon as possible--to pump the economy.
The best way to look at this is that they want to pump the economy with money but they have come to the end of their rope on creating new money, so now they want us to pay for it directly.
It's become one more tool in the central bankers's toolbox for how to pump an economy.
Rather than fix the underlying monetary policies, they want to ban cash! How idiotic.

Sure, but I think that's more a delaying and pacifying tactic. They can't risk bitcoin taking off in the popular imagination until they're ready to take advantage of it in someway themselves first. Par for the course, unfortunately. And they can't do much about people already in, so the play is to delay as many getting in as possible via FUD and extreme rhetoric.
I think they're still trying to figure out if they can spike bitcoin entirely so they can create their own controlled version on their own terms.
But we know that that won't likely be possible due to bitcoin's decentralized nature. All their usual tactics against a people's currency are foiled by a decentralized structure. They have no 'bitcoin company' to attack and destroy, no centralized servers to seize, and the 'drugs and CP' allegations aren't sticking since so much regular commerce is being done in the currency and cash has the same issue.
We may be looking at a realignment at some future point. The other hilarious thing is property, property is the other typical value store of the wealthy for generations now.
But if [seasteading](takes off, their property values may plummet to virtually nothing.

Not bloody likely, that would be fucked up. Tons of savers would lose money and it would be a terrible precedent. If they were going to do ANYTHING even remotely close to this it would be coins that haven't been spent for at least 100 years, it would be incredibly well publicized with massive warning periods, and probably have a means of redemption even after the fact.
But more than likely it will simply never happen. There's absolutely no need for it. Lost coins hurt no one.

Only when combined with monopoly law. Market anarchism doesn't face this problem, since there is no monopolist of law for the rich companies to bribe for favorable laws and privileges.
Therefore it's not a function of capitalism at all, but of crony corporatism. Any system with a monopolist of law, capitalist or not, faces the same problem. And indeed, some of the least economically equal systems are ones that aren't capitalist but feature a legal monopolist, such as the various attempts at communism, where sometimes the millions died of starvation while the political monopolists grew fat on stolen grain.

They would be unlikely to obtain mass adoption, however.
Even if nations begin creating their own state-coins (see Ecuador), the question becomes one of trust. Do you trust politicians and bankers, or do you trust an encryption algorithm.
The result would be bitcoin as a world currency, state-coins as local currencies. Such coins wouldn't be able to transcend the borders where laws force them into use. And also wouldn't be able to stop movement into bitcoin.
You'd find a lot of people using state-coin to perhaps buy and sell daily, taxes, etc., and once again saving in bitcoin.

It doesn't matter if the news actually changes anything or not, the important point is the effect on the community of bitcoiners. All it would take is to closely watch the market, correlate with news, and realize that good news creates positive price pressure that makes it the absolute best time to sell off a few coins.
Then people wanting to rationally maximize their cashing out will simply wait until these positive points and then sell. You get enough of them doing this and the price will drop every time there's good news, they get over-exuberant trying to fight each other for buyers.
Of course this is beginning to create an expectation in us that the price always goes down on good news, and some people now wait for good news *to buy!* because the price will be locally lower.
My theory is the sellers are early miners from 2010 with a whole lot of bitcoin to burn just trying to maximize their income by selling a few bitcoin every time good news hits. But it could be a lot of regular people doing the same.


No, I'm saying the price could possibly go a bit lower if they sold when there wasn't good news.

Silly. They'll have to find out the hard way why this won't fend off bitcoin.
Fedcoin by Russia is not better than fedcoin by the fed.
We use bitcoin to *escape* abuses of power by those who control the dollar. Thus, those same people trying to create a cryptocurrency won't attract users.
A cryptocurrency is a global currency, local fiat is no longer necessary.
In a situation where all currencies compete globally as cryptocurrencies, Thier's law takes effect and the good currency inevitably wins.
Bitcoin is that good currency, because of its cap on the number of coins issued, which NO fedcoin copycat will ever emulate, because the ability to inflate at will is the modern state's primary tool to exploit all the people who use that currency. They are unwilling to live without it.
Since a russian cryptocurrency cannot defeat bitcoin in the long run, they will try to survive in the short, try to make Russians use their local coin only.
But anyone will be able to buy bitcoin with russian-fedcoin, and to save in bitcoin and transact in fedcoin, etc., etc.
This is the beginning of the end for fiat. Once they legitimize bitcoin by trying to copy it, repudiation of fedcoin will follow closely behind.
Let's see, use a currency that continually *gains in value* over time, or one that continually *loses value* over time? It's not hard to imagine which one is in the interest of the citizens.
And the only people benefited by inflationary coins are the people who control those coins themselves.
If you're not going to make a decentralized currency, there's zero point in making a cryptocoin anyway, just use private servers and be done with it.
They want the label of 'blockchain' and perhaps improved security, but it will be a shadow of what bitcoin is already.

Modern unspent from addresses are not at quantum risk. Bitcoin was designed from the beginning to use unspent-from addresses as much as possible and avoid reuse.

Bitcoin will be regulated to death--except in all the places that it won't be. And that's the key.
Bitcoin hurts big players in the world economy by threatening their abuse of the fiat money system.

Ecuador is an ideal place for bitcoin to take root, the Ecuadorean currency was abandoned by the people there decades ago, because the government abused their ability to inflate so badly that everyone was like alright, fuck you, we aren't going to use your 4th world currency--and they started using dollars and other local currencies, and ever have ever since.
Ever since, the Ecuadorean government has been desperate to get the people back on their controlled currency so they can resume thieving value via inflation, and they even tried creating their own cryptocoin awhile back, but after what they did to their currency, why on earth would the people ever trust them with a controlled cryptocoin? No chance.
But this did deprive the government of the ability to attack bitcoin since they had endorsed their own cryptocoin previously.

Or, just read up on Austrian economics, which is already bitcoin-friendly and fiat-antagonistic.


Yes, Austrian economics rejects that idea of cardinal value scales for use of ordinal value scales, relying not on numerical and impossible to establish so-called "utility."


Sure, through its attempt to become a science based on numerical models and prediction. Again, a practice AE doesn't condone.


Relying on GDP has a ton of problems, sure. AE has been critical.


"Could" doesn't mean it's a good idea. Collective property is more expensive to manage, especially when your collective is all of society, which really means the politicians own it, not society.

Unlikely. Everyone keeps getting richer. In 1900, 80% of the world lived on less than $1 a day. Today that's less than 20%. 
In terms of purchasing power, 1-hour of labor today buys a helluva lot more than it did 100 years ago.
You have been fed pseudo-economics and you believed it.
Neither does might-make-right. It doesn't matter if there's a ton of wrong people, reality continues on as before. Even if they "revolted" and overthrew all conventional notions of property, their prize would be only poverty.
Wealth is not a zero-sum game where some are poor because others are rich. Rather, wealth must be generated by each person, and creating wealth creates a larger pie. The poor need not rise up to improve their situation, they need only produce more. And that's exactly what they've been doing.
How long did China spend trying socialized forms of economic planning? It was only after they abandoned socialist economics and imported capitalism and western-notions of property rights and production via the reintegration of Hong Kong that they brought their billion+ people out of dire poverty and into the world economy, where their incomes have skyrocketed in a single generation. They could've done that decades ago had they simply abandoned the very forms of economic collectivization that you're sitting here saying we should all move into.
And yes, they'd be even better off if they made their economy even more free.








That's great, our system is sick, but the root of that sickness is actually the state, not private property.

Deflation is fantastic when it's not a result of a previous inflation.
Fears about deflation in bitcoin are groundless, since bitcoin cannot be arbitrarily inflated. Thus there can be no deflationary spiral which is harmful, only nice and sweet constant and low deflation.
Once the inflation becomes nominal in another 4-8 years or so. Inflation is still relatively high today.
But with this halvening inflation will roughly match that of most countries historic average, or thereabouts, like 4%? 
That actually masks the true number. If the economy grows by a couple percent the money should actually deflate a couple percent if the money-quantity were held constant. The fact that the money still inflates every year is actually a sign that they're inflating away all the growth and then some.
Say your country grows 5% but your inflation rate is 5%, that means they're actually inflating by 10%.
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:38:11


Actually you can also pit that against the US dollar. Few people realize this, but the US actually inflates more the 1-2% per year. That's the inflation target, but you have to consider what would happen if there were no inflation at all.
If there were no inflation at all, the quantity of good would increase relative to the quantity of money, which means money would become on average more valuable rather than less.
Which means that absent money printing, deflation is actually what results.
So take the national growth for the year, let's say it's like 3%, without inflation money would *deflate* by 3% naturally.
Instead, the government wants it to *inflate* by 2%. So what does the government do?
It actually inflates by 5% to achieve that 2% figure!
If the country grew at a rate of 18%, the government would inflate by 20% to achieve that same 2% inflation figure.
The government is stealing much of the increase in wealth produced every year by invisibly inflating it away. And they get away with it because practically no one understands what inflation is or how it works, and only problems that are mass-understood become political issues in a democracy.

If you're thinking of a deflationary-spiral, you must consider that all such spirals are caused by previous instances of inflation which themselves cause bubbles, ie: the business cycle of Hayek.
The kind of deflation I'm talking about is natural and normal to an economy, and the US went through decades of it just fine during the 19th century in a period of extreme economic growth.
It's not my fault that some people have led the US economy into a dead end while the roof collapses. People like me have been warning against this for literally decades.

That's a good point; Satoshi made a new wallet for each block mined, IIRC.
So, anyone with the actual QC power to steal coins is faced with a dilemma, take wallet by wallet, or crack wallets one by one and delay the sweep, risking the chance that someone else may sweep them in the meantime.
Which means they'll likely start sweeping immediately and, as you say, it should still take some time to sweep even one address.

I don't think so. Firstly, this is a scenario that I actually consider likely. The biggest countries I expect will create a crypto-currency and mandate their use.
Many other countries will simply drop their local currency because they can't administer a cryptocurrency of their own, or can't force people to use it as easily as these big countries. They might simply just use the biggest nearby currency, or else bitcoin.
In this situation, bitcoin becomes a defacto world currency mediator, the international currency, because it is sponsorless. This is actually good for bitcoin.
As for ease of use, places like Coinbase and Bitpay will make it as easy to use bitcoin as people use banks now, but you never have to go into the bank to cash a check and everything's instant.
It will be an improvement for everyone, and still just as usable. Only people might save in cold wallets, but they'll likely transact via services, much like I still use a bank to run my debit card. Bitcoin debit cards already exist and will continue to exist.

It's not likely that the first world will adopt bitcoin in large measure first. The first world has entrenched and wealthy powers with a lot to lose if bitcoin becomes huge. They are looking out for themselves at this point and trying to figure out what the existence of bitcoin means for their cash cows, how not to get steamrolled.
Meanwhile the rest of the world is more utilitarian, they want what the first world has, and if bitcoin can help them get there, then so be it.
On the one hand, the third world has its monopolies and cronies as well that are in many cases much worse than the first world's protectionist policies. But there is a whole lot more 3rd world than first out there. It only takes a few places where the conditions are ripe for bitcoin to become quickly entrenched.
I'm thinking especially of Venezuela and Argentina, China to some degree, definitely Kenya with its experience already with digital money, Africa generally, and anywhere where remittance can turn bitcoin into a sleeper-hit, like Thailand and Bangladesh.
In these places, the government is often ineffective at dealing with high technology issues in the first place, and it's not like you can simply ban bitcoin.
As smartphone tech trickles down to the third world, the currently unbanked are likely to be price-sensitive.

This has everything to do with bitcoin. Does this ring a bell for you:
"Jan. 3, 2009: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."
If you don't know what that means then you don't even know the first thing. It's the very reason for bitcoin's existence in the first place.


That's not why I posted it though. I posted it because it's a great article having *everything to do with bitcoin*. Notice I don't make any predictions as to when this could happen, because this is not about price. It could easily take 20 years, who knows. 
But for those who are into bitcoin because they hate inflation and money manipulation by power elites, *such as the creator of bitcoin himself*, this is a great article to dig into and many here will appreciate it. It's about the future potential, the promise of bitcoin. When rapid inflation hits, people reach for assets. Every time.

Because work-places are private property. Do you want people to have democracy when they visit your house? Should visitors vote as to what to eat out of your fridge or what to put on the TV? Come on.


Because democracy sucks, and cannot give people what they imagine they want: liberty.


Not to feudalism, no. This writer does a disservice to the world by misapplying definitions. Feudalism was a function of the state. Capitalism does not require a state, only property. And property predates the state.


All socialist analysis of capitalism rests on this analogy to feudalism. Until you guys challenge it and see where you're wrong, you won't progress. This is also why the world has abandoned socialism.
Also, hierarchy is not inherently bad, it's compulsory hierarchy that's bad, which is to say it is compulsion that's objectionable, not hierarchy itself.










Except in places that tried to create socialist paradises, none of these things happened, and instead people starved every day.
Private property is not the enemy, it never was. Socialism has failed because it misidentified the actual problem.
















The idea that corporations are feudal monarchies is laughably wrong, unfortunately for her.


Companies have an incentive governments never had: they must please customers to survive. Customers don't buy death and destruction.

This is what a miner said he did during the last halving and at other times. When the price dips below their minimum operating costs, they don't stop mining, but they do stop selling, and they also *start buying* so that when the price inevitably comes back up over their costs, they can sell those coins they bought at the lower price to hedge against the loss income from when they had to stop selling. This is a reasonable strategy if you can be reasonably sure that your mining costs are competitively low enough with the entire world.

Unless the cost exceeds the value of all coins, you're talking about something that could cause bitcoin to lose all of its value. Of course they would try.


The entire world is already geared into bitcoin primary. No other coin will be able to do that. Bitcoin will squash it like a bug and continue on. This is what the network effect guarantees.

Oh I get it, you were one of those people who got burned on Zimbabwe dollars and now anyone else trying to escape inflation enrages you.
I can guarantee you one thing, the number of bitcoins in dollar terms that are mined every day are far, far, far less than the amount of US dollars being printed every day, haha!
And for bitcoin, there's a hard cap. After 2016 that inflation figure halves, and halves again 4 years later, etc.
Meanwhile the number of dollars being printed continues to rise. Over $7 trillion printed in the last 8 years. Is there any analogous limit or cap for dollars?
Enjoy your monopoly money.
You've forgotten the lessons of German hyperinflation too easily. When people bought and sold money by weight. 
When families burned money because it was cheaper than firewood. When people wallpapered houses with it because it was cheaper than paper.
When they queued in line with wheelbarrows full of it to buy bread.

People would invest anyway without inflation. Inflation only tries to make people do more of what they would already be doing.
And beyond that, inflation is outright theft of all money-holders. It's not ethical in the first place, and this theft does not benefit us at all, it actually takes money from the poor and gives it to the rich.

Either someone is forcing rules on you, or they aren't. That's not a false dichotomy at all, it's a complete one.








If you're choosing to be part of a system with those rules, then it's a function of your freedom.
But when governments come around, they don't ask you to opt-in, and they don't give you the chance to opt-out.
Bitcoin, thus far, is the ultimate opt-in.

Are you telling me you're completely ignorant of how bitcoin works? Transaction fees are optional, but usually paid, and an order of magnitude less than what credit costs.








Actually cash customers currently pay for credit costs too, because the credit companies for the longest time made them charge the same price for cash and card, so cash customers ended up subsidizing credit customers.
I think you should expect to change for any service/transaction you engage in, but you'll pay much less with bitcoin.

They stop selling and they buy coins to hedge and try to recover lost profits until the price recovers up to the mining-cost, which it virtually must inevitably do. Then they can sell the bought coins at a profit and continue on as before.

I think you're fighting a losing battle.
Things were a lot more dicey four years ago with dogecoin coursing and litecoin and the like all threatening bitcoin. Especially dogecoin.
The dogecoin people believe that hype and media mentions was driving bitcoin's price adoption. People like me said they were wrong.
Where is doge today?
What is this "if Bitcoin is going down"? You must be unaware of the network effect, which says that a network is more valuable according to the number of participants it has.
This is already a nearly insurmountable barrier for any new altcoin.
Secondly is something called path-dependence. The more people that choose bitcoin, the more likely they are to stick with it, this being driven by the network effect.
These two are nearly insurmountable for a challenger.
Combine that with Doge's foolish mistake in eliminating their coin-limit via not understanding that a deflationary currency is far better than an inflationary one--they never recovered from that.
The only way a currency can take on bitcoin is to incorporate a feature bitcoin cannot. But all cryptocurrencies live in the same digital domain, they can all do the same thing. It is things outside this domain that can do things others cannot do.
Example: all newspapers can do the same thing, they put pictures and words to print on paper and deliver them. The game is the same for all of them. But then along came tv, tv can do things that newsprint cannot do. Compete in ways tv cannot compete.
This is why no cryptocurrency can likely surpass bitcoin. And bitcoin is the ultimate currency, there's not likely to be something new beyond the digital some day.

The address crypto is not quantum vulnerable until you've spent from it. But bitcoin anticipated this and is setup at its lowest level to deal with this. Everytime you spend from an address it sends the entire amount and you receive the rest as change--in a new address that has never been spent from.
Thus is obtained quantum invulnerability, as long as you stick to the default client behavior of never reusing an address.
This also holds true for signing a message from an address, btw.
It also does NOT hold true for all addresses in the first two years of bitcoin's existence which use a slightly different scheme and are quantum vulnerable still today.
These early coins, Satoshi's coins among them, serve as a canary in the coalmines for the theorized quantum attack, and also stand as a financial incentive to develop quantum computers!

Uh, what? Courts that are government funded, with judges literally selected by the president and congress--and you have the gall to call them independent?
In what way could they possibly be independent? They are **part of the government**--explicitly!
Here's an example, suppose you sued the government because you believed that you should not have to pay taxes under some amendment.
Who will you go to to stand sue? Federal court.
A court where a judge, selected by the government, and paid **by tax dollars** and therefore with an interest in taxation continuing, will try your case and inevitably toss it out as unmerited.
This violates the very basic principle in justice that the one who tries a case must have no interest in either outcome.
Honestly, coming here and trying to tell us the courts are independent. 


Because it is an unethical and aggressive institution. Look up the non-aggression principle.


Unless that concern is the government itself.
Look I don't blame you for having been brainwashed to think that government is good--having been raised in a government society and probably in government schools.
But you might want to step back and take a look at the [ethics of government'( and decide if you really want to support the theft, slavery, murder, etc., that the government openly engages in by different names: taxation, conscription, and war.

The article is not wrong. Many of us who were early proponents are here for philosophy, for ideology, because we are perhaps voluntarists whom simply reveled in the idea of a state-independent currency. I know I was and am.
You see, we are libertarians and some too are [anarcho-capitalists](which is largely synonymous with voluntarism, and there's something we've learned in the last decades of stumping for libertarian ideas.
We learned that we will never be able to convince enough people that we are right by sheer words to achieve meaningful change in the US, much less the world. Not while democracy is the primary means of decision making.
So we've changed strategies. 
Rather than try to convince people we are right about our political, economic, and monetary theories, many of us have decided to simply put them into practice, to build parallel institutions and offer their advantages no longer in theory but in practice, and allow the benefits we said would exist in theory to draw people to using them in actual fact.
What people will not accept or believe when you tell them how your ideas would play out in reality, they will believe and accept and actually use if they see those advantages in practice.
People using voluntarist institutions that we create will then, in time, absorb the ideology into their lives by osmosis, without needing to be taught explicitly.
Perhaps we can call this the osmotic strategy for change.
Bitcoin is the tip of the spear, the Silk Road was revolutionary law defiance in a similar vein, but there are more projects coming that are continuing the osmotic revolution that even fewer people know about.
There is the [Meshnet](which seeks to create a fully end-to-end encrypted and peer-to-peer internet service that doesn't rely on centralized servers and thus can't be snooped the way the current internet is.
There's apps like Textsecure for android seeking to make end-to-end encryption easy for everyone, to make snooping far hard or impossible for government privacy-piercers--they recently rolled this into Cyanogen Mod invisibly, making it easy for everyone.
There's [Bitmessage](an attempt at adopting the blockchain concept for sending encrypted messages.
There's [Bitlaw](a program I've been developing that's still not public, but seeks to make it easy for people to choose and trade their own law and contracts in a voluntary context.
And there are voluntary court-replacements like the now-defunct Judge.me which worked well and was a great idea but needs to be reworked.
There's also more inclusive movements seeking to bring all these together in one place: [seasteading](and [spacesteading](seeking to create oases outside existing government jurisdictions for free societies to form, places where you need no one's permission to live sans a tyrannical and oppressive state.
A seastead would use bitcoin as its default currency, its currency of account even, would abandon using centralized means of law production like politicians, elections, or legislatures and simply let each person choose law for themselves, and let them contract for everything else.
This century is the century of the osmosis strategy, and thus far cryptography has proven to be a central enabler of that strategy, because it denies governments the one thing they require to stay ahead of the population in order to control them and keep them in the walled-garden: information.
Without information they will lose control. It is all but inevitable now due to circumstances that have been put into motion. We now get to watch the wheels of history turn, first with bitcoin, and later to see the oldest institution of all fade away: illegitimate government power itself.

True, but there's actually good reason to think that in the case of bitcoin.
Two reasons: the network effect, and path dependence. Lookup Peter Surda's master's thesis on bitcoin and associated articles on this subreddit and you can get his full treatment and explanation on those topics.
Briefly, the network effect means that the network becomes more valuable as more people join it, which gives it a first-mover advantage.
Path dependence means that as people choose bitcoin because of the network effect they're going to care less and less about other alt-currencies.


The value proposition of that alt-currency would have to be both significant and technologically superior to replace bitcoin. None of the copycode alt-currencies would meet that judgment. They aren't different enough. A true bitcoin challenger would have to be structurally different and superior in a way impossible for bitcoin to match. Any current alt-currency feature simply forked off of bitcoin could be patched into bitcoin if it proved that important. And things like namecoin and colored coins aren't direct competitors at all.


The would be a lot of good reasons not to own this. Loss of privacy, but more importantly the loss of a guarantee against inflation! You underestimate how important that is. If you're not going to avoid the problem of 3rd party trust there's no need for a blockchain.


3rd party trust rears its head again. And that's why these schemes never take off outside their respective walled garden. In any case, I'd welcome the competition.


I don't think you understand economically why bitcoin was designed to be deflationary. Those other 'features' you cite would be negatives.


It's certainly better than anything we have right now. That's all I need to worry about until something objectively better appears, if it ever does.

Bitcoin has a fundamental unique value proposition. It is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distance transactions.
Ask yourself if the future is going to have more online transactions or fewer and see where that gets you.

Bitcoin is to trade what the internet is to communication.

And why do you imagine the government would be forward thinking enough to not sell?
They will treat it as any other seized asset and sell it off when the court case ends. Practically guaranteed unless bitcoin goes to the moon before the court-date is over and dollar fails.

We've heard this doom and gloom time and again. Such reports never account for new tech and new discoveries, obviously, they cannot report on what's unknown.
For instance, due to fracking the US is expected to become an oil exporter within 20 years.
Meanwhile, the amount of oil available at say $200 a barrel is orders of magnitude more than what's available at $100 a barrel, since there are a lot of wells that are unprofitable to operate, much less how profitable it would be to go searching for new ones at that price.
Besides which, if you've been watching solar tech advance for the last half-decade you'll know that it's quite likely on the verge of price-parity with oil and coal and will then surpass both in cost per watt.
We know already how to make a perfect solar antenna, just a matter of commercialization and scaling.
Ie: 
And, with biodiesel, we can make oil out of electricity. If we had zero oil left today we'd be forced to switch to alternatives, but we'd still be able to make oil chemically for various lubrication needs.

Socialist institutions tend to be centrally controlled, like fiat money.
Individualist institutions tend towards decentralization, like bitcoin.
In the great argument of whether it's better to have an economy planned from the top (socialism) or one where each actor makes their own plan (individualism), the latter has won out.
So too, each miner decides their own policies and which mining software to run, etc.

Right, and that point is a bit too technical for him to grasp, unfortunately. He's a political novice and thus easily led astray. It just goes to show how uninformed attitudes tend directly towards socialism and government aggression as the easy answer.
No wonder socialism has gotten as far as it has. The whole parent-metaphor of government is very intuitive, but it's time for counter-intuitive government solutions to arise.

Greed has negative connotations. There is nothing negative about speculation or investing. No one's being harmed, no one's spending their last dollar or their kid's college money on bitcoin.
Rather, investment is what built the modern world and you should be applauding it rather than casting aspersions. 
We all take action that we think will benefit us, and we consider this perfectly reasonable. It is not 'greed' to go to work to obtain a pay-check or any other form of obtaining money without harming another. 
It would be 'greed' to take money out of your kid's college fund to buy a car.
If you see any opportunity to make a profit, bitcoin included, and you invest, this is not greed, it is speculation, and ethically neutral at the very least.
If you had a time machine and could go back to the founding of Apple and had a chance to invest in them, this would not be greed either, it would be helping something get off the ground.
People buying into Bitcoin now are helping it build liquidity, legitimacy, a market track-record, and driving market-cap growth which is what will be needed for mass-uptake to eventually happen.
Ie: if the OPEC nations want to price oil in bitcoin one day, and I predict they will, we will need much more than merely $1b in market cap. Maybe more like $100b.
It would not be greed to see bitcoin as an opportunity to profit and invest in its potential.
I'd like to see you defend why you would call it 'greed.'


It seems your qualification for greed is 'effort.' So if you profit extraordinarily without much 'effort' that then is greed? 
What of the poor rancher under whose fields was discovered oil, and all he had to do was sign his name to the development deal and he was instantly made a multi-millionaire. Was he greedy? Or was he within his rights and harming no one and simply taking an opportunity presented to him.
Shame on you for characterizing a legitimate investment in something as awesome as bitcoin as 'greed.'

That's largely the exchange value, exchanging coin for goods. And I think that makes up a small but growing percentage of its overall value. Its primary value is in speculation right now, but if an economy picks it up, exchange value will take over.


That's an interesting use, but right now I don't think color coins are even functional yet, they're just an idea, so that would constitute no part of its current value, though certainly could play a role down the line.


Probably won't ever be a big part of its value.

You're talking about bitcoin becoming the unit-of-account in economic terms.

It's a criticism from those who don't understand why deflation is a good thing for an economy, or have a biased interest in an inflation-based economy or are otherwise misinformed into thinking inflation=good.


Since inflation is bad for an economy, most likely bitcoin-1 would win out against the 2nd currency over time and it would be a waste of effort.


I'll just let those people keep complaining and watch things unfold. Deflation = good in a free market.

He doesn't assume it, it's obvious on its face. Pick any online transaction facilitator you want and look at how much they charge. The two largest, and therefore we should expect the lowest current marginal cost, as Visa and MC, which charge between 2% - 4%.
Bitcoin charges *pennies* and can even do free transactions.
If you doubt this you simply don't know anything about bitcoin. He doesn't have to prove it, it's inherent to bitcoin, obvious on its face.


Actual cost: insuring transactions, dealing with fraud, chargebacks, etc. 
Bitcoin's cost strucuture: dramatically lower. No possibility of reversed transactions, no insurance, etc.
Perform a $10,000 transaction on a credit card, costs your retailer about $200. With bitcoin? About 13 cents. 
That means the retailer can lower the price by $100 and still make $100 more on that sale.


You act as if electricity were the main cost the banks have. 


Why are credit cards charging 2% - 4% then?


Right, bitcoin changes it from mandatory to an option. Most people would rather have the money themselves.


False. You're ignoring the retailer fees which is where most transactions are paid for.


Seems like it's you who doesn't understand how credit card companies work from here.

Start by getting your head straight:
["For a New Liberty: the Libertarian Manifesto"]( by the venerable Murray Rothbard (free copy at that link).
Want to fight centralization of power? Become a complete human being. 
And by that I mean become well rounded and take responsibility for yourself in all aspects instead of relying on others. If you apply that principle to politics it means you have to stop accepting the idea that others should have the power to make decisions for you via politics and force laws on you via voting and democracy.  
After that, deprive centralized political systems of their lifeblood: your tax money. Do that by moving to place which recognizes your right to keep everything you earn. 
Unfortunately such places are extremely rare in today's world. But that's why there's and companies like Blueseed set to get independent jurisdictions up and running where we can experiment with new political forms beyond this ancient and decrepit mechanism called democracy that has outlived its usefulness.

There's no way to give another person power over you without abuses eventually happening.
The only person that will always treat you fairly **is you**. Because you will always have your best interests at heart. Whereas a politician will sacrifice you whenever it's in his or her interest to do so.
Thus, what we need to do is reject the idea that some people should have power over other people. The only one who should be able to make laws over you **is you**.

Mainly because the dollar is not inflating at 120% a year. Even with unlmtd-QE they won't inflate by that much unless there's a major screwup. The $6T Obama added to the debt offset the trillions that were lost on paper, which is why we haven't seen massive inflation by that act so far.
The $US gov-rate stated inflation is ~4%, the true rate is closer to 11%, per year, not 11% a month.
Certainly the weaker dollar will contribute some to the rising price of bitcoin, but it doesn't explain bitcoins 10%+ recent price rise in the last month.
OTOH you could attribute 10% price increase entirely to the dollar's weakness if you suggest dollar holders are buying bitcoin as a hedge against dollar inflation.
Problem is I don't think enough people know about it, and about economic theory and history also, to make that kind of statement.

It's perfectly possible to buy fractions of a bitcoin, at whatever price you want.
The idea of "1 bitcoin" is actually an illusion. Each one bitcoin is actually 100,000,000 satoshis, which is the current lowest divisible unit, and if your wallet has 100m of those satoshis then it shows it to you as "one bitcoin."

No, if you called that a right then the gun maker would have to give it to me for free. If I bought it, that's a voluntary transaction. He doesn't have to sell it to me, he does it of his own free will. Important difference.


Rights delineate the areas in which it would be wrong for another to deny you. Ie: you don't have a right to be heard but it would be wrong of anyone to force you stop speaking in a public area. Similarly you have a right to own a gun and it would be wrong of anyone to deny you the ability to buy one.
Thus, were you to try to stop the gun seller from selling me his gun, you would be violating our freedom of association and freedom of contract.

They've given value for value already. He's not "extracting wealth," he earned it.

He just needs to be a cypherpunk programmer with professional skills in programming. He stood on the shoulders of giants for everything except he originated the idea of the public blockchain to solve the double-spend problem. Essentially he did this by merging the long-tackled e-currency ideas with modern P2P systems. Crypto and hashing just makes it work and is probably something he already well understood but nothing he had to create. With the blockchain idea in place it became just a matter of implementing the system and coding a bulletproof system, which he must have already had the skills to do. It was undoubtedly an idea so compelling that he worked feverishly on it.
Creating bitcoin then was probably something he realized he could do with his skills-set at some point, and he just set about doing it, excited by the idea. 
He would've already been well versed in the practices and theory of internet-based op-sec in order to pull off 1-year+ of anonymity as he did (and this largely precludes working with another programmer).
Probably he was employed as a professional programmer, or perhaps an academic of some sort. People call him a world-class programmer for a reason.

Tops for 2013, the whole year, is another question entirely, but I think we'll definitely see bitcoin break $100 before 2013 is up. And that sounds like a safe bet right now.

For a small purchase like a cupcake, no one's gonna wait around for confirmations. You broadcast your transaction, see that the network sees it, see that there's no double-spend attempt (ie, a second transactions competing with the first), and you walk.

Nothing inherently wrong with fractional reserve; there will likely be fractional reserve bitcoin banks one day. What's unethical is not making it absolutely explicit that money you have on deposit is being loaned out and risked by the bank.
Banks should keep two kinds of deposits, 100% reserves that are guaranteed to be there, for which most people would need to pay a small maintenance fee, and fractional deposits which are loaned out to people are are free or even interest bearing bank accounts, because you're earning a share along with the bank.

I'm convinced it can and does. Lower transaction costs means it's a killer app. When an online retailer can increase their profits from 50% - 100% by accepting Bitcoin instead of a credit card that is **massive incentive** to push bitcoin, which means they'll be willing to give up a portion of that profit increase in order to drive sales towards it by offering a discounted price if people pay in bitcoin.
That will then drive competition, new business models, etc., etc., and companies will remain competitive only by also accepting bitcoin.
The only reason bitcoin is still ~$70 is because it has a low confidence factor due to newness of track-record, and because even most people in this subreddit don't have the confidence to make valuation projections like this.
I'm confident that bitcoin one day will be able to replace Paypal / Visa and Mastercard sales entirely, within my lifetime even. But even taking 1% of their business, the price of bitcoin would have to rise into the thousands of dollars. That could happen within 5 years easily, and will become an accelerating trend afterwards.

I read a piece on this in relation to CP. Not being able to own it legally has unfairly ruined a lot of lives, for example those who run TOR nodes in which CP was flowing through, resulting in raids on their houses. They had no idea CP was flowing through.
Then you have investigators and lay-persons trying to fight the criminal activity behind CP, the taking of it--that's the real crime, and often people need to possess CP in order to identify and fight against the actually criminal behavior being depicted.
Meanwhile we now have minors falling foul of CP laws for sexting each other nude pictures of themselves, which is clearly not what CP laws are meant to tackle and it not an example of abuse at all.
Anyway, I remember reading a whole piece on it that made a pretty convincing case from a legal/ethical point of view. Of course CP is absolutely reprehensible and awful, but the criminal portion is the act involved not the photo of it. Makes me sick to even make the argument, but it's much like the way that defending free speech requires you to defend the right of even Nazis to speak too.

As for being quiet for a month, the problem is it's not any one attack group, but probably a couple trying to arbitrage what they see as an unregulated market. But the fact is that markets are hardy, they learn, adapt, and can't be manipulated anywhere near as easily as people seem to think.

Exactly. Trezor turns a very tough digital security problem into a physical security problem.

It's a bit like explaining a joke, isn't it?
The general public thinks anarchy means simply not having a government--not what we mean, which is government replaced by voluntarism and voluntary institutions.
It's not that you'd need everyone to be an ideologue libertarian, but that you'd need those voluntary institutions in place.
You don't need to know how banking works behind the scenes to use a bank. Similarly you don't need to know how those voluntary institutions would work in a libertarian society in order to use them.
See the difference? Losing your command institutions in a statist society leaves you bereft of any institutions at all. It doesn't make it overnight a libertarian/anarcho-capitalist paradise, because libertarianism is not simply lawlessness.
Those institutions have to be built by people who do know how they work in the first place. 
So no, not everyone would need to be a libertarian to function successfully in such a society, just as people aren't philosophically committed socialists or statists living in our own.

Also, since you're parents are likely less tech oriented it might be a hard sell. But, are they renting to college kids, in that case score.
My feeling is if the parents aren't tech savvy to a certain degree it will be more headache than boon at this point.
We still need more technical development in the bitcoin space before we can go full-tilt and your average ma and pa can just adopt bitcoin and have it work fluidly. We'll need, for instance, hardware wallets that virtually eliminate risk of hacker-theft without physical access to the hardware wallet. 
The case for bitcoin is compelling for online stores where you can just hire bitpay, add some code, and be done with it in no time. But for physical companies and cash companies we're still not there. We need a whole NFC eco-system to evolve first that is only just arriving.

Space cannot, by definition, be infinite. It may be able to expand infinitely, but it will never actually expand so large that it could be described accurately as being 'infinite' because an infinity of anything can never exist. This is a property of reality and can never change.
Just as there are a finite number of atoms in the universe, there is a finite amount of volume.


The good evidence we have of the expanding nature of the universe makes this already ruled-out.
Since space is actually 'space-time' if you actually made it to the edge of the universe it's possible, even likely, that you would run into odd time-based effects which would make passing that boundary literally impossible, as it would expand faster than you could ever approach it, and the time-based dilation would ensure that.


This I consider quite likely.


The fact that the early moments of the universe expanded far faster than the speed of light allows speaks of a universe unfolding spacially, similar too the hubble discovery of objects further away moving faster and expanding away faster and faster. I think this has to do with time-dilation related to being 'closer to the edge.'

That's not a situation that's going to subsist long-term. It's more a function of low market cap and jitters over the US dollar, and potentially the hidden inflation gathering in the US dollar, as well as spiking demand for bitcoin as awareness builds.
This is pretty normal for an uptake cycle, and exciting! But such things won't always happen. Most of 2012 for instance was just slow and steady gains.

The rulers of those countries did it as a way to gain power over others in their country, they controlled all the finances with US backing. There was no vault to siege and control all the nation's wealth anymore.
Plus if a country tried to kick X out of power, the US could just say, no, do that and you have no money. He's our guy. So it became a quid pro quo, a sort of dual reliance that helped both parties.
But for the country giving away their gold, their rulers were definitely selling the nation's gold down the river.
Which is really poetic justice since taxation is theft anyway, so these countries got thieved by the biggest thief of all, the US government.

Many businesses are running on a profit margin of just a few percents or so. They also typically pay 3-4% credit processing fees to the credit giants Visa/MC for all online purchases, and so do their competitors so it's all an even cost-basis. 
Enter bitcoin. 
Removing the 3-4% fee by using bitcoin, which costs pennies or so for each transfer, a company can sometimes double their profit margin, yes. This makes that company a much stronger competitor too, giving first mover advantage to anyone in their field whom accepts bitcoin and drives buyers to using it via incentives (lower cost), which could turn into rapid business adoption of bitcoin if they begin realizing they must use it and promote it if they wish to stay in business.

What came before? We've always had massive market intervention by governments. Just look at Europe. Why did the industrial revolution begin in England and the US? Because it was the one place on earth with both some wealth and where the government didn't put a heavy hand on the economy. It took Britain and the US centuries to catch up on regulating the market. By then capitalism had already changed the world.
Of course, much credit must go to the Saracens civilization that handed the ball to the West during the middle-ages, seeding the flowering of the rennaissance and englightenment.
We will show you a world without regulation, as libertarians during this century found the world's first seasteads, apart from government entirely, funded with bitcoin, and where bitcoin is the primary currency.

The price is demand driven and people are waking up to bitcoin. It's got enough track record and development now that people are beginning to put real trust in it.
That, I think, is more important than the block reward halving.
The fact that bitcoin offers the lowest possible transaction costs for digital transfers is the heart of its valuation. As people realize they can make more money by pushing transactions in bitcoin over dollars, bitcoin will take over the market for online transactions, and demand will continue to sky rocket.
The next block reward halving in 2017 will be a much larger shock perhaps, because the price will be much higher by then and regardless of what it is at that point will need to nearly double in order for miners to continue mining profitably.

Republic meaning the rule of law. Democratic meaning using majority rule. The idea was to limit the power of the majority with minority rights. However the majority has to enforce the rights and have chipped away at them now for hundreds of years. It's clear that the American experiment with limited democracy is nearing its end and will end in failure.


But they have failed in this regard.


Not likely. Slavery was illegal in many US states before the SC got involved. 


I don't see why. Every businessperson knows they must please their customer to make a profit.


I've spent 20 years thinking about how that could be done. Every scheme imaginable has flaws, ways to cheat the system.
I've realized that the only person who won't cheat you **is you**. What we need to do is reject the idea that someone should make laws for us and allow each person to decide their own law-set, then allow communities of legal agreement to arise organically, putting an end to adversarial politics and democracy in one fell swoop.

Let's say you spend $1m on bitcoin when the market cap was $1m, you just doubled the price and then some of each bitcoin, doubling the market cap = huge volatility.
Now, drop $1m on bitcoin when the market-cap is $100 billion. It won't even register as a price fluctuation. You might move the price a few cents? I don't want to do the math.
Thus does higher market cap create price stability. It begins to take larger and larger amounts of money to create price movements in any direction.
I think that's why the price manipulators have moved on from using money-flows to pump and dump and are now using DDOS to do the same. The market-cap has gotten too big to crash the market with mere money movements.

This could actually be a boon to the economy as it would concentrate money into the hands of those with the most productive plan instead of spreading it thin as now among those who have even marginally productive business-plans and correspondingly high failure rates.

Certain people have been matched with a Tor identity by comparing the times they were on the computer to the times their suspected Tor identity was logged in. This has been used to obtain a conviction at least once to my knowledge.
It's possible to fudge this, and the authorities have to already suspect you and know your physical location, but it's happened once already.
Ie: suspect was home between X hours on Y dates, suspected online identity only posts online between X hours on Y dates. Correlation over time, 100%.
If they track this sort of usage correlation long-enough, say weeks, it's possible to establish without reasonable doubt that you are the identity they want, even though you're using Tor.

More people mining doesn't change how many bitcoin are mined each day. It -may- distribute the ones that are found more broadly, leading to less drastic price changes if these people don't sell, as those coins are more likely to be held if spread thin than concentrated in fewer hands, due to marginal value.

Indeed. Every government has eventually succumbed to the temptation to inflate, at first in small part, as we have experienced in the US in the last 100 years, and then in great measure.
Particularly eye-opening is the experience of the French during their revolution, where people who'd lived through a hyper-inflation under the old regime convinced themselves that a democratic government would never hyperinflate, and went through another one, twice in the same lifetime for many of them.
By the time Napolean took over he'd learned the lesson and refused to inflate the currency at all--even to the detriment of his war efforts.

My understanding is every spend from an address sends the full amount and what's left is received as change.
Every time.
If you can point me to a source for your alternate understanding that'd be great.


So you send two payments of 1 btc to address X. Address X now has 2 btc in it.


Correct, but it will do so by sending 2 btc to that address and then receiving 1 btc back as 'change.'


No, it's always true when you spend, it's just that some clients will use the same address you sent from as the receiving address for the change, thus it appears that the money never moved, and technically it didn't.
This is built into the protocol for every transaction is my understanding.

No, if an individual does not give consent, then they don't get taxed.
Theft isn't theft only because a majority says it is or isn't. Laws cannot make theft right or wrong, theft is always wrong.
Democracy is not magical, it still must live by ethical norms.
Democracy is little more than a tool to legitimate the use of force by the majority against the minority. It is also socialistic in character, because it places the will of the majority as superior to the will of the individual.
I tell you that in the future that is to come this situation will be rectified once and for all. The individual's will and rights are sovereign, and no group or power may legitimately use form on them.

Here is Surda's master's thesis, entitled:
[**Economics of Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin an Alternative to Fiat Currencies and Gold?**](


part analyses the applicability of the Austrian School of Economics at Bitcoin. Of particular interest are
the evolution of money, competition among media of exchange, and the concept of money supply. The
empirical part analyses the following variables: price, price volatility, liquidity, visibility and velocity. I
come to the conclusion that theoretically, Bitcoin can b e closer to the Austrian ideal of money than either
at money or gold, and it is possible that it will evolve into that position. The results of the empirical
analysis are consistent with Bitcoin being a medium of exchange.

Indeed, the next three years are crucial, the supply of mined coins is still fairly generous, we'll find another 5 million coins or so in the next three years, but the decline is rapid from there.

Theory and actual practice does not support your sentiments here.
Money does not equal labor, nor is value equal to labor. The labor theory of value has long-since been debunked and disproved, tho certain segments of socialist thought haven't gotten the message and continue to perpetuate this mistake.
Value is not objective in any sense, nor inherent, value always requires a valuer. It doesn't matter how much you think your labor is worth, it only matters how much someone else values your labor, the two create a price, a trade of labor for another product or valuable, such as money, creating a wage or a sale.
As for money, people value it because of its specific qualities that allow it to serve as money.
In the case of bitcoin, it's the best currency ever created for online and distant transactions. In other words, it's the perfect currency for a global economy.
We therefore expect many people to value it as we do now once the information about it suffuses to the population at large.
Which means demand will likely rise. Which means the price of bitcoin will continue to rise because supply is quite limited.

I assure you it's not a misconception, and I'll explain.
Asicminer has another 100 terahashes worth of equipment ready to come online. They won't do so because they don't want to spook the network with anything close to 51%.
At the same time, they don't want competitors to be able to reduce their hashing-share.
So, if the overall hashing power of the network climbs, they have plenty of power ready to deploy to keep them at a constant percentage of the total hashing power, or even to grow a little.
The higher the total network hashing power goes the more expensive it will be for anything to match their percentage of the hashing network, which means increasingly larger barrier to entry for newcomers, which helps cement them in place.

- Greed: Intense and selfish desire for something...
- Selfish: Lacking consideration for others...
Ie: For investing in bitcoin to be 'greedy' you'd have to do it in a manner that lacked consideration for others.
So, again, it would only be greedy to invest in bitcoin if you were doing it at someone else's expense, eg: raiding your kid's college fund to buy bitcoin (not wise because bitcoin is likely too risky and speculative to risk their future on).
Buying bitcoin with your own money is as greedy as buying any stock or mutual fund; in other words: not greedy at all.
To invest in something because it's awesome technology and set to revolutionize the world of finance is at best optimistic that things will go well in a reasonably short time-frame.

People have this wrong idea that individualism means you can't or won't group together for mutual benefit. That's not what it means at all. Individualism assumes that humankind is a social animal and will seek out voluntary relationships.
Rather the difference is subtler, in the question of whether the purpose of one's life is to serve the good *of the group* or one's own highest values.
If the group is superior to the individual, than the individual will be sacrificed for the common good, and this will be considered an ethical duty. Thus when famine spreads across the land, they'll put the fat man in the pot, tell him to boil in joy and think of the good his death will do, and the fat man will very quickly become dissatisfied with socialism.
Meanwhile, the individualists say that the purpose of your life is not to serve the social whole but rather your own highest values. That *may include family and the social whole* but it not as well. You will help others not out of some duty to society, but because it pleases you personally to be good-hearted to another, because you value other people.
Subtle change, but significant.
And an individualist society will never try to sacrifice the individual for the supposed good of the social whole, suggesting that the individual's rights are co-equal with the whole, that no one is to be sacrificed as if the group were more important than each individual.
Thus, in a famine, the farmer who has seed-corn left will not be forced by the group to feed everyone seed-corn causing everyone to starve next summer, because his property rights will be respected even in the midst of famine. And he'll instead plant corn and restore abundance next fall. Actually chances are in an individualist farming community you wouldn't have a famine at all, because of the incentive structure on each individual to produce for personal gain.

It does actually, because the step beyond that is to cut the company out of the equation by having people use it directly.
But more important than that, it will drive demand for btc higher, driving the price higher, and a high price drives adoption because it spurs bitcoin activity and purchases, generates news, and increases the market cap. Some uses for bitcoin can only happen once the market cap reaches certain heights, such as, say, pricing oil in terms of bitcoin rather than dollars. Market cap needs to be at least $100 billion if not twice that, and that possibility is still just a twinkle in our eyes.

In the recent FBI report on bitcoin they decided it was no immediate threat because they can still track when you spend dollars into bitcoin and when you cash out of bitcoin, thus they've still got you by the balls in terms of taxation and capital gains.
What they won't see coming, hopefully, is when people break free of the dollar orbit and both earn and spend in bitcoin entirely circumventing the dollar.
Of course, if you're being paid by a company in bitcoin, your company is turning dollars into bitcoin to pay you and that's tracked... I think you see where that leads.
Also, if they legislate against bitcoin they'd also have to crack down on other digital goods like the Amazon coin and Google Play money, etc., and they don't want to risk killing the golden goose.

This is exactly the kind of problem that should drive people into bitcoin. So, how exactly could bitcoin alleviate these sorts of problems? 
One bitcoin should be seen as a dollar equivalent in such a market. And in cases where inflation is likely, as a hedge against the official currency degrading or devaluing.
What you need then is a bitcoin-dealer in country willing to take the official currency at a discount (to reflect both uncertainty and to take an immediate profit) and provide bitcoin in exchange. What this person does with that weakening currency they're collecting, I'm not sure. They'd have to have some connection to where they can turn large amounts of currency in dollars or goods of some sort.
Probably Egypt doesn't yet have the technical integration to make a bitcoin economy work outright. For that we need near-field communication and smart-phones to be ever-present.
But as a hedge and value store, Egyptians should be able to buy and hold bitcoin to weather the storm of government-uncertainty.

@_date: 2013-03-19 20:26:39


Not exactly. What you're referring to is how the bitcoin software looks at public addresses. The program internally uses a hash of the public address. But we still see the public address broadcast in the transaction, thus why you can look up addresses on Blockchain.info and see their transactions publicly.
So, essentially the private key is hashed once to give the public address, then hashed again when you go to make a transaction for the internal working of bitcoin. I have no idea why that 2nd hash is used internally to the program however.

Well, it *can* but it would cause enough market fluctuation that cashing out would cause you to lose a significant percentage. This is what low-liquidity means. The second you tried to order $100m worth of bitcoin, the price would skyrocket, and downrocket when you tried to sell $100m worth. Because $100m is a significant fraction of the total market cap.
So in order to move $100m it might take days or weeks to flow that into and out of the market with minimal disruption.
But let's say you wanted to do $1m, awhile ago that would've been a major pain, but now the market cap makes it a blip on the radar. You might see movement of a few dollars, maybe $10 in price, if you tried to do it all at once, like the $700k purchase that bumped us over $50. If you spread the  purchases out just a bit you could do so without much disruption.

No, inflation is where you add new units of currency. What I'm talking about here is where you split existing units of currency into smaller and smaller pieces which become possible due to deflation.
I've seen other people concerned about this as if it were inflation, but it's the exactly opposite.
It would be like if we took one dollar and let its value float and suddenly dollars are actually worth $100, then we'd start issuing pennies as if they were dollars and we'd have to make an even smaller coin, the 100th penny to now act as a penny.
But we wouldn't be making new dollars in that scenario! That's would mean inflation, whereas splitting the currency into smaller and smaller units is a consequence of deflation, and not inflationary at all.
What bitcoin can do, splitting into smaller units, is much harder for a paper currency naturally.

Coinbase is entirely different. They have to deal with fiat-banks and sending fiat-money digitally. So why did it take a week? Because US banks dealing in dollars have to comply with a 5-day reversibility mandate, whereas bitcoin is irreversible. So they can't very well give you bitcoin up front from a bank draft, since you could easily reverse the bank draft. 
This is common knowledge.

If the entire planet switched to bitcoin, each person could have only 0.003 btc, or 3 btc^-3.

As for this currency of theirs, it gives them a certain amount of control. They can profit internally on the coins.

So, it's small fry compared to bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:25:54
Much of the volatility is due to uncertainty about how quickly bitcoin will be uptaken the world over.
Once bitcoin has achieved full market penetration that uncertainty is gone, for we now know how long it has taken since it's done penetrating the market.
And then we'd know how governments have treated it by then, either taking hardlines or not.
And we'd know what its ultimate price will be at that point, because it will have arrived.
So, once these major unknowns become knowns, the uncertainty is largely over and demand will be stable, thus volatility is largely gone.

Then don't pay over $70. Ultimately though, anything less than it's full adoption value is below its true value. Just a question of discounting that value backwards and adjusting for confidence that it will actually get there. 
Whether you think a higher or lower price is justified depends on where you think it will end up with what confidence.
I'd say it's true discounted price is more like $200 right now.

I'm not a Randian anti-altruist, and I think she was pretty misguided in those sentiments. But I think it was a reaction to the time she lived in, and was a philosophic attack on the idea that living one's life as a means to the ends of others was the highest ideal--this is the root concept of socialism (in pure philosophical form). 
She instead fostered the idea of individualism, the each person's life is a means to their own ends, not the ends of others. 
The way she chose to express this I personally find distasteful and untactful as it is so easily distorted by opponents into something like Sternerite evil-egoism. That's not her intention, she's against the doing of unethical things in the pursuit of one's own end, but for each person viewing their own life as the end.
In America we live as individualists, our culture is highly individualist, though most people don't recognize it as such.
Ultimately the philosophical battles that have come to a head in our century are those of individualism versus socialism.
Bitcoin, as it turns out, is a victory for individualism, distributing power and decision-making among a network of co-equals, giving no one arbitrary power over the others, respecting the decisions of each with each in a voluntaryist context.

You're equating government with police/courts, when no such conflation is necessary. This is a common error made by those contemplating a libertarian society without having looked into it.
I suggest that while government is certainly unnecessary, police and consequent rights protection and also dispute resolution services such as courts are certainly necessary to any society.
And a truly free society, even without government, would have both of these things--only they'd be provided by the free market rather than government, and thus be far better and far cheaper.
If you want to learn more, download David Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom" which goes into this concept at length.

Ultimately the answer to your question is that bitcoin would have to achieve some victory from which it cannot be dethroned.
That could mean taking over some nation's financial heart, where a forward-thinking country might actually abandon attempts to use their own currency and transition to bitcoin. Bitcoin use would then spread like wildfire.
There are other scenarios where bitcoin drives a stake through the heart of the world's fiat currencies, such as if OPEC nations began pricing oil in bitcoin rather than dollars.
I expect we'll see that in our lifetime, and that will be a massive shock to the world, and probably triple the bitcoin price in a day no matter what it gets up to prior to that announcement :P

For instance the Reddit bitcointipbot operates essentially free-to-tip, but let's people tip it directly for more service options. Hmm.
Should actually be easier for your service as you get messaged directly by a tip whereas he has to actively scan Reddit continually.
Also, the cost to you doesn't increase as the tip sent increases. Thinking back on reddit tips, they're usually in the greater than 25-cents range - $2 or so. He has a minimum tip as well. 
How about a set fee in btc, say a nickle's worth? Right now that's 0.001059 BTC. How about 0.0015 as a fee, like 7 cents? But whatever it is, I think it should not be percentage dependent, as your costs don't vary by amount sent.

They self-identify as socialist, so good luck with that.


They should do so by buying or creating the means of production. Then all you have is capitalism.


If it's owned by someone it's being used. If it's unowned land, no one will stop you.


This is the core of the socialist argument, but it's fundamentally flawed. Profit is not theft from workers. Marx may have defined it as such, but he was wrong. If profit is theft, why do workers agree to give the business owner any portion of their wages at all? Why do they not sue? This is where the Marxist must come up with ridiculous psychological conspiracy theories of people being deluded into giving up profits, etc., etc. But people are not so stupid. 
Again I'll explain it to you. People are willing to take a job AND to give a share of their product to the capitalist because they can earn MORE when producing with the productive capital of the business-owner--even after the owner takes his cut of profit--than they could earn on their own without the owner's productive capital. Thus it is win/win for both parties. It is not theft at all.
Marx created this idea to build a moral flaw into capitalism and his supporters are still spouting it today, but the whole idea is entirely an illusion, a twisting of facts, and not supported by the real world actions of people.


A hundred years ago the starving were fed through private charity. Just because the state has used its power to take over charity doesn't mean the it couldn't or wouldn't be provided another way. Just politicians need stuff to do to justify their existence.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of monopoly.
Monopolies are only possible when granted by governments, when created by law, or protected by law.
Without an alliance between business and government there is no such thing as a monopoly.
This has been true since the earliest times. The idea of monopoly first came about when lords would pay kings for a regional monopoly. They feared competition and used law to keep competitors out. That's how it's always been, that's still the way it is today.
Remove government and monopolies become impossible.

Demand for bitcoin, and thus price, should correspond to volume over time. As adoption of bitcoin as a technology increases the price should correspondingly increase due to constrained supply meeting largely unconstrained demand. 
I'd expect the price of btc to forerun volume, creating lots of price exuberance such as we saw in the recent crash.
If lower transaction costs of bitcoin are a killer feature then we should expect demand to increase over time until saturation of its use as a tech. The price only isn't higher now because many people still haven't heard of it, and those who have, haven't yet employed it.

Well, estimates of the total value of world currency are something like $70 trillion. Take 21 million bitcoin possible and divide by $70t and that's how many bitcoin would equal $1 if bitcoin took over worldwide commerce.
1 btc would have the purchasing power of $30 million today.
The risk is in whether that will actually happen--bitcoin taking over world commerce--and in how long it will take. If it takes 100 years, that's very different than if it takes 20 years. Or if uptake is slow on front-end and rapid on back-end, etc.
The number $30m / bitcoin seems entirely hyperbolic, but it's not actually unreasonable. It's just so large in comparison to today's reality as to seem impossible to reach.
But that price when world-penetration is reached is actually just the beginning of its valuation. It will keep deflating from there.
And I think uptake as a technology will be more rapid than people think. We can get one-third to half the planet using bitcoin within 15 years I'd say, all of those for whom internet access is common and easy, perhaps more than that.
This price isn't illusory or merely subjective--it's that bitcoin has better qualities allowing it to serve as money than any other existing form of money, even gold.
Bitcoin's lower transaction costs will bring in retailers, greater privacy will bring in consumers, etc., etc.
Bitcoin is only the latest manifestation of the impact of cryptography and computers on world culture--which largely began with the breaking of the German and Japanese codes during WWII, and the subsequent creation of the first industrial computers to do so. Computation, communication, and cryptography have been entwined ever since.
Perhaps the real question is whether the current political order will survive the coming realignment; whether the nation-state can survive a world where it cannot control people's finances or track purchases. Can the modern nation-state continue to exist without the power to control and inflate currency?
No. It certainly cannot.
Anyway, bit of a tangent there, but ideas have consequences and bitcoin has some interesting ones.

If you're a business you'll likely be generating a new receiving address for each customer, because how else would you be able to track payments.
No one knows you own this receiving address, you  just generated it. 
This functionality is built into the basic Bitcoin-QT software as a matter of course, you can create new receiving addresses and name them for your customer, and thus track payments over time from them, etc.

I'm part of the gen that had to buy in rather than got to generate coins easily. Professional miners were taking over with ASICs as I began to buy coins. That's a new era of sorts.

SD is a betting program, you send them some btc and they output a provably fair result resulting in win/loss for you.
Many people throw very small transactions at SD and it has been responsible for a very large amount of transactions on the blockchain, like over 60 or 80 percent of them?
A miner would block it 'cause they're considered nuisance transactions. SD allows you to bet individual 100 millionths of a bitcoin (the minimum unit currently, also known as a 'satoshi') so it becomes pretty spammy and inflates the size of the blockchain while also not being productive in any real sense. A miner may prefer to give priority to actual transactions from any other source first.

I can easily prove it's ethical. Show me a victim.
No victim, no crime. And if a person wishing to commit suicide does so, they cannot be called a victim.




Sure. I think you'll find that just about every physical item in the universe is ethically neutral, it's all in how it is used.
There's no such thing as an evil pen or a good pen, evil is in the decisions of its wielder. The same pen that writes a beautiful sonata can be used to graffiti someone else's property.


So the mentally affected don't deserve the right to defend themselves with hand-guns, or take recreational drugs, or kill themselves at will? I disagree.
Just because they're mentally affected doesn't mean they're dangerous. If they've been shown to be dangerous that's another matter, they've shown proclivity thereby to violate someone's rights and it would be rational to them deny them guns, and that's what reputation systems are for. You don't need regulation to achieve that, no.

Your wallet has a main address and key, but it auto-generates 100 other keypairs and uses these automatically as you buy and spend. So the main address may have say 1 btc while some of those other addresses have w/e balance, but the client sums them for you.
The way to fix this, if need be, is send all your funds to any one address, and the client will empty all the balances in all the addresses to make this happen--but there's really no need to do so, unless you're going into a cold-storage wallet.
Also, while you have 100 to start, there's no effective limit on how many you can have and it makes more as needed.
And yes, the primary purpose for these other is receiving change from spent addresses.

Are you unaware of the government's [inflating]( the money-supply after the 1920-21 depression? Of the newly created Fed holding down the discount rate artificially and thus flooding the market with money?
Sans the ability to create money, the government will be divorced from fiscal policy, and there will no longer be political incentive to try to alleviate economic problems, resulting in much more rapid readjustment, such as in the 1920 depression where legislators operated as Austrian economists suggest they should always operate and the economic readjustment was so immediate that most people don't even know about the '20 depression, as opposed to the 1929 crash which was lengthened and made worse by everything the gov did, and was handled in the way that the gov is still today attempting to handle our current economic downturn, and the same way that Japan tried to handle theirs, resulting in their 'lost decade.'
Bitcoin promises to remove monetary and fiscal policy from the hands of government politicians, thus removing the political temptation to 'do something' in situations where the best thing that can be done is to do nothing, but you don't win elections by doing nothing.

Every four years the mining reward halves, meaning when a miner finds a block they right now receive 25 bitcoin for doing so, but in 2017 the reward halves to 12.5 bitcoin.
The last halving was last December, which havled the reward from 50 to 25, and was also the first block reward halving. The price quickly went from $12 to the height of $266.
Partly the price had been depressed prior to that, I think, because this was the first halving and no one knew if it would go off without a hitch or not. 
But also, when the reward halves, miners have to up their prices to stay profitable, so that does create upward price pressure.
It'll be interesting to see if 2017 produces bitcoin-fever yet again, or if it's quiet next time, but I expect speculators to ramp the price just prior to the next halving to try to duplicate bitcoin-fever again.

I really don't see any underlying mechanism that would cause this prediction to bear out.


Bitcoin adds utility to every transaction completed with it, via lowest transaction costs. That quickly adds up to whole lot of money saved, and raised standards of living for everyone using it.
That aggregate savings is where the wealth of early adopters is coming from, paid forward from the future utility to humankind.
Bitcoin gets created once, but serves all future epochs of humankind. I think you underestimate how valuable it is in that respect.
Also you're making very large assumptions about who owns what from being an early adopter. Does anyone have 1 million coins? Hard to say. And the '11 price run up also distributed a whole lot of coins out of the hands of early adopters.


That assumes a lot. I don't think it's an issue.

@_date: 2013-03-29 07:22:52
You might have bitcoin banks that fill current accounts needs for which you'll use a credit card and pay your bill in bitcoin out of a cold storage wallet. Thus the transaction will be as fast as a CC. Kinda like how Mt. Gox trades aren't on the Blockchain, they're central to Mt. Gox, your bank can do the same thing in the service of immediate purchases.
Alternately you could out the middle man and just start an account with your retailer and pay in bitcoin as needed.
But the difficulty of double-spending is so hard that there's functionally no reason to worry about it. For small amounts, businesses won't bother waiting for confirmations, there's no need. A double spend would need to be precisely timed and have the collusion of a miner. Are you really going to try to double-spend a couple bucks worth of groceries?
And for larger amounts, like buying a car, everyone will be willing to wait for adequate confirmation.

It's not really a problem tho.
Here's how it's dealt with: you buy something in person, authorize the transaction, the transaction gets broadcast over the network.
Do we now have to wait for confirmations?
Nope. All we need to do is look for double-spend attempts, that is an attempt to broadcast a competing spend of the same coins.
That takes a few seconds, as the broadcast goes out to all clients. About the same few seconds that it takes for a credit card to be swiped and come back with an authorization.
Then the customer walks away and both parties let confirmations happen on their own.
This is what Bitpay does and why buying something with Bitpay doesn't take 10 minutes to confirm. It's almost instant.
Besides, who would double-spend for a stick of gum? For larger transactions, like buying a house or a car, they take so much time that 10 minutes of waiting or more is nothing compared to the buying process itself, and thus worth waiting on for absolute confirmation.

There are escrow services for this.
This is one reason I didn't really do localbitcoin, hard to figure out the logistics. 
I think if it were me, a two step transfer would be my preferred method (without using escrow that is).
Basically I'd prepare a paper wallet with the btc on it.
Once in person I show him the blockchain address to verify the amount in the paper wallet. He hands me cash, I hand him paper wallet. He transfers balance to his preferred wallet. At least that way you have a physical exchange to show first, in case anyone ends up cheated.

But all a printing press can do is inflate their own currencies, thus stealing value from all the holders of that currency. And the more they inflate their own currencies the more they will push consumers towards uninflateable currencies.
Inflating your currency only works when you can lock-in consumers and force them to eat the dirt you produce.
Bitcoin gives the average person a way out, a way to escape the currencies that have been forced on us by our government(s), resulting in a massive decrease in government power and control.

Ancient democracies, in Greece, in Athens, inevitably devolved into tyrannies. Every single time. The majorities eventually voted to do awful things, ala the death penalty to Socrates, etc.
What Socrates didn't have was a Bill of Rights. Thus the founders of the USA invented *limited democracy,* and as an experiment it's been okay, but you can see today that the flaw in the constitution is bare.
The flaw is that the very people given ultimate power are tasked by the constitution with *limiting themselves* and people in power don't like to be limited. So they push the boundary and that becomes the new normal for the next guy.
Fast forward 239 years and we have government doing openly illegal stuff, violating the constitution with virtually every act, and acting as the primary power in society, and they cannot be stopped.
I've analyzed every possible means of turning things around and find them all wanting. There will always be lobbyists in Washington convincing politicians to pass laws over the entire country that are against everyone's interests but the lobbyists and the politicians.
But then I realized there was a better way that we could move towards, and I'll answer that with your next question:


Not exactly. When people hear 'anarchy' they usually think of chaos, lawless areas and people, no police, and no recourse for your rights being violated--the urban jungle, and that would be awful.
I'm an [anarcho-capitalist](and this is not the kind of anarchy we desire.
What we want is not lawlessness in that form, but rather the end of the principle that others can force laws on all of society.
So, what is individualist government? It would mean that no one can force laws on you, except yourself.
It would mean you would make law, as if you were president and congress rolled into one--purely for yourself and your property.
No one could force you to make or remove any law over yourself and your property.
But the caveat is that your law only extends to your property boundaries.
So, if you want to visit another's property, the two of you will have to agree on the terms of your visit, what laws you will visit under, and vice versa if someone visits you.
What keeps this from becoming a circus is that if people don't like your law-set, they simply won't visit you, and if you don't like others's, you don't set foot on their property.
Businesses will have very accomodating law-sets because they want you to visit and spend money.
In this kind of society, people would hire private police to enforce laws they set for themselves, and use private judges to adjudicate disputes.
So this is not an 'anarchy' in the popular conception, but it **is** an anarchy in the sense of the meaning of word: 'anarchy' means 'against all archons' meaning against all rulers. In this scenario, no one is ruled--instead we rule ourselves as sovereigns over our own lives.
It is a society built on the idea that we can turn methodological individualism into a political system.
Now it might sound a bit impossible, laborious even. Who wants to become a legal expert and write laws. Not me, probably not you. And who wants to negotiate laws every time we visit a friend's house or set foot outside.
Well, it wouldn't be like that, actually. What would likely happen is people would form varied kinds of *communities of agreement* where everyone in a certain area accepts the same law-set, where they've come together specifically to do this.
Thus you'd have legal competition in a sense between these varied communities, and the successful ones would grow in adherents, and that law-set would spread very quickly, because it doesn't need some congress to change the law--simply each person changes it for themselves.
And where did they get this law-set? Probably by subscribing to the published law-set of a lawyer who specializes in creating cohesive law-sets for people, much like a mini-founder. 
Further, once agreements are in place they need not be changed necessarily. So if you visit your friend's house and he sets a 'no shoes' rule for his house and you agree to it, you're now bound legally.
The reason democracy will always self-destruct is that it is predicated on collectivism. The idea of majority vote is a collectivist tool that subjugates the will of the individual to the will of the majority.
This is what must end. And the way to end it is to do the exact opposite: to place the locus of political control in each person's hands. You rule yourself. Stop being ruled by others. It is self-governance without outside government. That is the new anarchy.

No, because you'd have the power to walk away from anything and start your own thing, unlike now where power is geographically forced on you.


Actually things like insider-trading would mitigate this. Insider-trading would be both legal and widely reported in a free market and work against any such hidings, since all hidings would create profit opportunities for those willing to out the truth, and the bigger the secret the bigger the profit.

Yes, you are correct. That's why the Kenya Kipochi / M-Pesa news was so huge :)
Long-distance transactions are where bitcoin has the greatest comparative advantage, and it should be the wedge we're pushing.
The huge problem to solve is remuneration back into local currency.
Which ironically becomes a non-problem if bitcoin every becomes the unit of account globally.

It really depends on the entropy of the password chosen. A high entropy password of 35 characters is pretty good. It would have to be a string of truly random letters, numbers, and special characters. 
If you simply chose a couple words to put together, that's less strong, though the old 'correct horse battery staple' password concept holds, since the correlation between those words is high entropy. They don't normally go together and thus aren't easily guessed.


The keylogger would simply pass all text you type to someone else who would scan it and try simply everything you typed as a password. The more sophisticated ones would take SS's and copy down URLs, etc., thus making it trivial for the crook.

Mmm, dunno about that. 32 nm was state of the art in 2010, 22nm in 2012, 14nm in 2014. So, 28 nm is reasonably 2011 technology. 
You really think there aren't foundries making 28 nm with a continuing contract with Orsoc, a mainstream ASIC manufacturer with a large book of business outside KNC's chips?

@_date: 2013-09-07 03:21:16
Not really. You don't need 6 confirmations for anything really, it's just to be safe.
Bitpay confirms a buy after about 5 seconds of looking for a double-spend attempt, which must be conducted almost immediately after the spend.
Lacking that, you're safe.
LTC is a solution to a largely non-problem.
And transactions that do need the added security of block inclusion confirmations typically take longer anyway.

Nah, it just means a price is a communication in the market.
No one can say objectively -why- someone bought bitcoin on Gox. It could be either to escape Gox, or because someone knows something positive about bitcoin, ala the Gov meeting news.

@_date: 2013-04-04 20:58:31
Gov used their power to print money to guarantee all these risky loans via Fannie and Freddie, and yes pumped the market with weak underwriting standards. When the dam broke they then printed money like we've never seen.
Without the ability to print money, banks would not have trusted the gov to bail them out when the flood hit.

But does it have a light to illuminate the paper if not using a cellphone?
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:31:17


Absolutely. Before bitcoin came around it was the safest bet of all next to a hard commodity. People fled into dollars at the slightest provocation.
But those in the know are looking at the US's current accounts, debts, inflation rate and getting pretty jumpy. US politicians think deficit spending cures all ills, think debt can do no harm, think they can control interest rates indefinitely (even though low interest rates actually cause them to inflate too).
I agree it's hard to know when you're in the echo-chamber and when you're placing proper emphasis on actual facts. That's always the hard part and why I would never forecast when these things will come to a head. But I think it's just a matter of 'when' for the dollar, no longer 'if.'
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:07:11
Just 'bitcoin.' Also, do not capitalize it.
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:19:49
The fork created by the block would be reintegrated into the blockchain when it gets turned back on. That could cause some problems in theory, like some people would be able to double-spend coins if they had access to outside-the-country internet, but the coin would be functional inside the country as long as the fork remained, meaning it's economic value within the fork would still be operational even if the guy left holding the bag when the fork ended was screwed.
As for the difficulty and mining, you're right that would be interesting. They would have trouble mining any blocks at all.
Perhaps they'd be better off creating a temporary alt-coin to serve them and then go back back to bitcoin after the crisis.
Ultimately governments don't want to cut off the internet for various reasons. Intranets are expensive. They're more likely to try to filter, ala China and Iran. And that's where VPNs come in.
Ultimately there will be a battle to wrest control of the internet from the hands of nation states who want to use it as a means to control their captive populace and further their own power.
That's why people are working on an internet that doesn't rely on centralized DNS servers. You can go check it out over at @_date: 2013-03-23 23:04:16

False, gambling is not always destructive. It is possible to gamble simply for fun, in a responsible way, with money you can afford to lose, and treat like any other habit that costs money to engage in without it becoming a destructive influence in one's life.
You're acting like the kind of people who would prohibit smoking because it's 'bad for you' without respecting the right to decide how much harm a person is willing to trade for the pleasure of the activity.
Did you support the cola ban in NYC too?


Gambling does not have an objectively negative effect on the gambler. If it did, people wouldn't engage in it willingly.


I don't think you even understand what those terms mean at this point. Of course gambling is ethical.
Would you say investing is ethical?

Checkout ["Democracy the god that failed"](
The fact that a minority actually votes is just part of the problem. Democracies have more pressing problems, and more people voting percentage-wise wouldn't fix them. If anything, the elites would prefer fewer to vote as it gives those with incentive to vote much more relative power. And those with incentive to vote are disproportionately those receiving largesse from government itself, such as government union workers and the like.
The result is that democracy can be gamed, creating arbitrage opportunities. We already know that the single greatest determinor of election is not issues, but 'likeability.'
Conclusion, those who know how to get elected by promising the most largesse to the right groups, selling access and legal favoritism, and telling the public what they want to hear become politicians--ie: power-brokers.
You can stay with the sinking ship but I can guarantee that it will not be fixed, it will have to sink. The system has far too much political momentum to turn around today. You must fight not only an ill system, you must fight those who materially benefit from it and whom will come at you tooth and nail to defend their privileged position.
Why waste the effort when you can start somewhere fresh without entrenched parasites?
"Curing" democracy would also take an educated electorate. Chances of that happening? Zero. The electorate has been systematically dumbed down. If reform relies on educating the 51%, even the voting 51%, then reform is already doomed.

I'd take subscriptions and donations. Put a donation address at the end of each article unique to that author. Subscriptions are for the org as a whole, donations by author are split between author and org. Thus authors have incentive to compete as writers and also further the org by doing so due to the split.
This is something like a 'freemium' model. Read for free, subscribe if you believe in the paper and wish to support it on a continuing basis, donate if a particular article strikes you. Bitcoin makes it easy.

Again, by the principal that an unjust law is no law at all, any "crime" as created by law that criminalizes an ethical act is no crime at all. That's my stance. 
Since there's no victim in money laundering, there is no crime, and juries should practice nullification of that law.

I'm reading a book called "The High Frontier" which is about practical means of space-colonization, written in the 70's.
One thing I don't think people think about in the modern energy debate is how plentiful solar energy actually is. You build a big solar power-plant in space with cheap rotating mirrors that, in space, can be built very cheaply indeed as they can rotate for stability support rather than having support structure built into them, or can even use a small amount of gas in bladders as a pressure-platform for structural stability.
You can build mirror miles in diameter all focusing light on a point where your heat engine then turns it into a very great amount of energy, 24/7.
You put this thing in a geosynchronous orbit to where it has sunlight 24/7, and then you have it beam power down to earth using low-intensity microwaves, hitting an antenna on the ground that would be about 7 miles across. The midwest or on the ocean would be a great place to do this.
And this energy would be cheap cheap. Essentially free once the plant-costs are paid off. There's no resources to mine, such as coal or gas or nuclear, there's just plant and mirror maintenance, and built right it would last for centuries.
And with that beamed energy, you can produce any hydrocarbons you want at zero emissions cost.

A country cannot borrow indefinitely. That's a fact.
At some point the chickens come home to roost and consequences appear.
That's a realistic opinion. That it's taken far longer than anyone imagined is accounted for by the dollar's reserve-currency status which allows the US to get away with things no one else could get away with.
However it would be foolish to think that is bulletproof protection. That too has its limits.
Repudiation of the dollar is not unthinkable. We don't have world financial hegemony. In fact it's rather likely.
Either the US will repudiate its debt at some point, resulting in the end of dollar dominance (because no one else will loan us money after that), or the US tax rate will go up massively to pay-off debt ran up by the last few generations.
The former is more likely, and has historical precedence. Many US states have repudiated debt.

What you say here is not strictly true.
We need *people* to lead, people to pay for roads and defense and all that, yes, but there's no reason why **government** has to be part of that equation.
Government is *force*, they have the legal power of coercion, so if you say we need government to do these things you're really saying we need to use coercion to achieve these ends.
I challenge that strenuously. If people want roads, want defense, want schools, they will pay willingly for them. People willingly pay taxes to provide these services. They would also willingly pay for these services on the free market, *if government allowed them to*.
The real problem is that government has abused its monopoly on making law to give itself legal monopolies on police protection, schooling, mail carrying, road-making and a whole host of other services that are provided merely by people.
And there's one more monopoly they abuse: the creation of money.
Bitcoin will in time destroy their monopoly on money, because it is in the interest of everyday citizens to use a currency that cannot be controlled by anyone, a currency that cannot be inflated or seized from your bank account.
Governments *steal* money every year from the holders of their currency by inflating their currency. 3% inflation, such as in the US (more now) is actually 3% *theft* from all currency holders.
Bitcoin is the greatest invention in money the world has ever seen and there is no turning back for the world. I say this as an economist and a libertarian.

Utterly ridiculous. Fixed supply of currency does not impact savings at all!

If the economy produced $10 trillion worth priced in ฿, let's say it's at that point priced in 2 million ฿, then if the economy saves $1 trillion, in bitcoin that would mean saving 200,000 ฿.
What honestly is the difficulty in understanding this?
Know what happens to saved ฿? As with saved dollars, it gets invested and loaned out to new companies and ventures and the like and enters the economy again. It doesn't disappear.

Nothing. Bitcoin is still lowest transaction fee and lower time lost for international money transfers. It can entirely replace businesses like Western Union, which earn billions of dollars in fees each year. 
Bitcoin is also uninflateable, so it functions well as a wealth store.
Besides, there's too many people making too much money on drug criminalization for that to happen short term. Give it a few more decades and then maybe. By that time, Bitcoin will be far more established and ready to perhaps even serve as an international primary currency for countries whose currency has failed.

It's not really in anyone's interest to do a 51% attack tho, and it's something that would have to be sustained almost indefinitely to work. And then you'd have to also sustain it on any successors too, like litecoin.
I'm betting it'll play out more like when the central banks realize that they're in trouble as people begin organically switching to bitcoin natively, that there'll be a brief period of government-opposition at the highest levels, perhaps making it illegal to buy and sell bitcoin in some countries, but by then it will be too late for them.
That's how market disruptions work. They don't upset the bigger competitors they're disrupting, they often make them happy actually, until it's too late and the creeping effectiveness of the disruptor has backed them into a corner and left them no way out but to be crushed.
That's how, for instance, electric steel foundries disrupted the larger coke foundries. They had some 20% lower costs, but big tech hurdles. They could only make the least profitable kinds of steels, rebar, initially.
The big foundries were happy to give up the rebar market, because it was what they made the least profit on, so they could sink capital into their other product lines. 
So there was a huge rush into the rebar market by electric steel mills, driven by the large profit margin potentials.
The large foundries thought they were safe because no one knew how to move up to the more profitable sheet-metal and the like, with the requisite purity and the like. But there was so much potential profit there that entrepreneurs quickly set to the task and had working processes up in mere years.
And the large foundries happily gave up those low-margin product lines too, thinking they were safe because there's no way these small mills could make huge I-beams.
But of course, in time, they figured that out too, and all the other products, and electric mills took over the foundry industry completely. Textbook disruption case.
So right now we have Bitcoin that has already disrupted the sending-money-overseas industry, and online payment transfer-industry is on the brink right now. We might soon find a way to disrupt ebay with bitcoin, etc., etc.
I think the holy grail would be to have OPEC nations price oil in bitcoin rather than dollars or anything else; such a move should be attractive to them for various reasons--they could piss off Washington for one thing (they'd love to move off the dollar if there were a viable replacement they could trust. They don't trust the Chinese, and the Euro is obviously on the brink.), and they wouldn't have to worry about any country's inflationary policy either that way.
If that ever happens, we'll look back on today's prices with longing and nostalgia ;) But we need massively more market-cap before that could even begin to be possible.
Next 5 years will be so interesting in the bitcoin world.

Western Union I think may be able to pivot their business model successfully. It would be quite risky to build a WU competitor using bitcoin because WU has the incentive and money to squash you like a bug. They're not as tied to a certain structure as the CC companies are.

Not necessarily assuming no other cryptocurrency would come about, only assuming that -any- cryptocurrency that came about must necessarily have creators, and that these would be the ones who stress-test, initially value, and proof the system which allows it to become a currency in the first place and without whom it never could become one.
The windfall they will receive for their foresight is justified even if it is large. That's what you're missing. If these people really do earn billions in the end it will only be because humanity finds bitcoin worth trillions in use value.
Neither would I begrudge Bill Gates his billion for the trillions he enabled to be made with Windows. And clearly if Gates hadn't made Windows someone else would, but there's no point sitting around worrying about someone else's fortune as if that somehow took money out of other people's pockets.
Wealth is not a zero-sum game, it can be created by work and effort, and the work of creating bitcoin is one such example. They have taken money from no one if they become rich, they have earned it fairly, and I would never support a scheme to take away fairly and honestly earned money, and especially never support such an effort merely because of the dollar figure earned, even if it were quadrillions.
In a free market, the only power rich people have is to contract voluntarily. They cannot force anything lawfully. That's never going to change. If you want to argue that they can influence governments and cause mischief, I would agree, and say the fault is with the structure of government that allows power over people that can be manipulated, remove government and arbitrary power over people and the problem disappears, don't suggest removing rich people.

That wouldn't be a constant money supply then, it would be an inflating supply growing faster than demand. A constant money supply would be an unchanging, ie: uninflating one, and would be deflationary typically.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:43:37


It really depends on the rate of increase. Ultimately it's not a problem, no, as people have to eat and pay rent, etc. It's actually good to have deflation rather, because people's savings will go up, thus increasing the incentive to save.
An economy becomes rich in the same way a person does: by producing more than they consume. And the leftover is savings, which then gets invested to produce more and more.
If bitcoin is gaining value rapidly--as it is now--that will have a small effect on people's willingness to buy.
But in the entire history of bitcoin, this is likely to be a period of historic value increase, and nonetheless people are still spending bitcoins left and right.
Do not fear deflation.

*Some Austrians. When actually delving into this myself we find that value is a multi-faceted thing. A money has not only commodity value but also exchange value.
The Regression theorem, which this quote refers to, seeks to explain how something becomes money. Most moneys of the past started out as commodities.
In short, everything that eventually becomes money (ie: gains exchange value) must first be valued in some other way.
For most things this is their commodity value. But for bitcoin it's something else, since its commodity value is extremely small. Turns out there are a few ways it could've been valued early on, as a speculative object, as a cool tech, as nerd cred, and a host of other potential forms of value.
But not being 'backed' means nothing. What is gold backed by? We speak of being 'backed' in the sense of certificate-money. Bitcoin is not certificate money, it's like sending gold. Neither gold nor bitcoin is backed by anything, unless you want to count the extreme difficulty of inflating either of them. That you can rely on. 
Gold can't simply be created out of nothing. So too, bitcoin has a known inflation schedule that ultimately is extremely limited and deflationary.
Gold caught on because it's convenient to use as money. Bitcoin is even more convenient!

Competition will take care of that. Lower prices 1%, still earn 1% more profit avoiding credit cards--at minimum!
If you're a low-volume CC user paying more like 4% - 5% the case is even more compelling! This is people like corner stores and bakeries. But these people need to hear about bitcoin first and take a risk, so adoption will take time.
The good thing is that the cost to begin taking bitcoin is minimal, thus the supply side is likely to move before the demand side. It's not like you pay a monthly fee to enable bitcoin acceptance.

This is not quite accurate.
The modification needed to make this FPGA device work with Litecoin is simply adding a good deal of RAM and little else.
I don't know if you could make a Litecoin ASIC necessarily, but based on the Bitcointalk.org comments, you could definitely turn this FPGA into a litecoin miner doing megahashes in Litecoin.
They withdrew the Mars device because there was a lot more interest in having it retooled as a Litecoin miner than having it sent out as a bitcoin miner, due to the difficulty rise. 
An FPGA device simply won't be able to compete soon. Notice the video shows they pulled 6GH at ~420 watts of power draw.
The Jupiter ASIC device they're offering runs 350GH for 1,000 watts. Obviously incredibly more efficient.

Price psychology is much deeper than that. There are many goods that price themselves entirely out of the market. People want them, but they don't exist at prices they'd be willing to pay.
A few products are necessities and consumers must buy them, falling under the phenomenon of the elasticity of demand. Oil is such a good, one must buy fuel continually for one's car, despite price.
But whether demand is elastic or not, collusion to fix prices simply creates, inevitably, a profit opportunity for an outside firm. The free market is the best guarantor of fair dealing by firms that could ever exist. Its function in this capacity is only foiled by legislation.

ASICs are the new game in town for mining. A general purpose rig won't be much use soon.
ASICs will continue to increase in power via Moore's law, naturally.
They're actually behind the curve right now, using older manufacturing processes and the like.
Imagine a day when IBM puts out a mining ASIC. Now that would blow the cd-tray off anything available to us right now in the early days.

It's when governments screw up like this, inevitably, that Bitcoin has a chance at mass adoption in those economies as they're forced to start over with a new currency and have no trust in their political institutions to do better.
If bitcoin can be ready at the right place, time, circumstances, to pick up a national economy that just had a failed currency, how amazing would that be.

The two parties who seek him out for dispute resolution and bind themselves to his impartial ruling in order to solve a dispute they cannot solve alone. That is the only ethical way to do it. To think we must have a government appoint a judge is the actual perversion.


The winning party obtains the legitimate right to use force on the losing party to obtain back his lost value--granted to him by the loser when he agreed to be bound by the judge's decision. So the contract they both signed gives the right to enforce that decision.


Not their own people. War isn't typically considered murder; murder in war is a war-crime. 


There's no 'community' agreeing on a judge as a collective. Each court case the participants would decide together which judge they want. If one particular judge becomes favored by the individuals in a community, he's been selected via market process, individually, not collectively appointed by a community.
At any time, the individual members of the community retain the right to start a competing judging service, or to take their suits elsewhere, which is not an option given to you when the community institutes a judge and demands all suits go through him.

What you're talking about is when bitcoin becomes the unit-of-account in an economy, as it increasingly will become.
This already happens in bitcoin-related companies which have begun paying employees in part or in whole in bitcoin.
This is happening because people are preferring bitcoins to dollars, for obvious reasons like its deflationary value-increase and its lower transaction costs which means that $100 worth of bitcoin is actually worth more than $100 worth of dollars!
As long as people prefer holding dollars to holding bitcoin, this process will continue until the only thing people use dollars for is paying the government taxes and the like, assuming there's still a government as we know it at that point.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:59:02
Actually you could measure actual value pretty easily Since bitcoin offers the lowest possible transaction costs of all competing currencies, simply measure the difference in cost of each transaction in the world between what bitcoin transactions cost and what other currency transactions cost, including transitioning between currencies of account, and the result is your increased total utility, measured likely in the billions or trillions of dollars per year that will be transferred to customers and business-owners by using bitcoin over competing transaction facilitators.
In fact, a quick and dirty way to do it is just look at all the companies currently profiting from currency transactions and figure the majority of the profit their making would be turned into savings to consumers and increased profits for businesses and there's your valuation by year. Multiply that by about 20 and you have fair market value, somewhere in the trillions of dollars were you to apply this rubric worldwide.

What could the wealthy do in a society based on voluntarism?
If they harm you in any way, you sue them and obtain redress.
The difference is, in an actually free society you'd be able to use truly independent arbitrative courts that wouldn't be as subject to political pressure or back-room dealing and thus you'd be more likely to obtain a fair trial for yourself and against them.
This is because in a free society both parties have to agree on which court to use. Even a rich person cannot bribe every free-market court within 100 miles. And free-market courts rely on reputation for fairness to stay in business, not on elections nor a privileged monopoly established by government like our existing courts. Nor could the rich 'jurisdiction shop' as they do now.
There's every indication that a free society would be a cure for many of the current ills of the judicial system.
You have to realize that a free society marked by individualism does not mean there is no laws, it means there's a change in who creates laws and how they're accepted.
In a socialist society following the socialist-ethic, laws are created by the social whole, in our case, via representation, in which the *majority* forces laws on the minority. Democracy is then an agent of force that legitimizes the use of force, basically oppression, against the minority that objects to a law.
In an individualist-based society, no one can force laws on anyone, ever. So, the rich cannot force laws on you, like they do now in our society by paying-off politicians! Who will protect us from the rich now! Not government, they are the agency by which the rich enrich themselves at others' expense! 
In the free society, you, the individual, would choose what laws you want to live by, that is laws are crowd-sourced. And if you find yourself drawn to a particular societal philosophy, you'd join with others of like-minded and build agreement based communities. This is in perfect keeping with the rule of voluntarism, and it's a way to build societies without institutionalizing coercion such as democracy uses.
When you have a fully private-property society which uses crowd-sourced law, the result is islands of legal agreement.
Let's say you've chosen the rule that there should be no stealing. By so choosing you subject *yourself* to this law, no one forces it upon you. It is a matter of self-discipline. And it now applies to your property, and visitors to your property must agree to abide by your rule-set, and if they don't you will escort them off or sue them under the visitation agreement for damages. Ie: if someone comes onto your property, agrees to not steal, and steals, you are not forcing your morality on them, they agreed not to steal and they broke the contract, and they've also agreed to the process of resolution, of choosing a free-market court and the like.
The same follows if you go to someone else's property, you'd abide by their rules.
Because people would group together with those of similar mind on these issues, communities would form around the most important of these ideas. You'd have something like best-practices / best-laws form, blue-sky laws for businesses that everyone would be familiar with, etc.
And the reason that people would obey the laws and actually make recompense is because if they refuse to make good on their agreement they can be blacklisted from entering any law-abiding region. And since all private property, even roads, is privately owned, being black-listed by one residence or business could mean an entire city will refuse to let you enter, via solidarity. So the cost of being an outlaw punk is much higher than making good on the crime.
And if one city outlaws you, so may others, via internet and the like. In societies where this has been tried historically, such as ancient Iceland and ancient Ireland, this proved very effective.
I've had this discussion before and I think most people have a visceral negative reaction to this idea because you've been born into a system and you're comfortable with it and it's impossible to *imagine* how the system I'm talking about would work. That's okay. It took me a lot of work to become comfortable with it too, I mean months of thinking and studying and reading these ideas before my final objections were dealt with.
But I will show you this society working in practice as a seastead once we libertarians get them going :) there are many simply salivating at the chance to engage in this kind of political experimentation with new forms once we have our ocean-seed going.

Sure, except the barrier to creating a new addy is essentially zero and you have complete deniability.

How about an email program that requires you to send bitcoin to the recipient in order for a message to be received. If the other party whitelists you by reading/accepting the email and not marking it spam, their client will automatically send that bitcoin back to you.
If they don't accept return the bitcoin to you (by flagging or marking the email as spam) the price floor to send an email to you increases. System uses a p2p system to notify a sender how much bitcoin they must include in any letter they send.
If you don't read an email, the bitcoin gets refunded. If you read it, the bitcoin goes to you, but you can send it back if it's your friend (ie: by not flagging it as unwanted). If you flag it, the system raises the price of sending to you (or any number of other similar options).
This way, people who want to block all spam can do so easily, by raising the cost of strangers emailing them to something ridiculous.
At the same time, if someone wants to pay you to read their spam email, and they're offering like five dollars to read their email, hell, I'll read their stupid email, no problem.

Look into cold storage wallets on as Kiku34 suggests.
I suggest engraving a cold-storage wallet on stainless steel, that way it can survive a housefire.
The hard part is generating a cold-storage address securely. You need a secure computer. It's probably worth it to buy new a $300 netbook, load up a flash-drive with a saved webpage for creating addresses on it, create address, copy onto paper / engrave onto steel, then destroy computer and flash-drive.
It'd be nice if someone could create a cheap small device that would create key-pairs securely, leaving no memory of the pair behind after generation, using true-randomness, and is unable to go online, no I/O ports.

False, you own it and have contracted to sell the fruits of your labor to your employer. If you did not own the fruits of your labor you would not receive a wage as the fruits of your labor would not be yours to sell.


Completely false. You are borrowing the owner's physical productive capital because you can be much more productive with his capital combined with your labor than with your labor alone, thus you would make more at a job that working alone without capital--typically, which is why people choose to take jobs.
You're perfectly free to work alone and exchange the fruits of your labor without borrowing anyone else's productive capital to augment your productive power, and also free to trade for productive capital yourself.

Dunno. I think they've been hoarding goal as part of a cultural trait more than anything. It may also be party members trying to get wealth out of the country because they can't move it out in yuan, too many capital controls. I don't think they institutionally are that interested in wealth.

Explain to me then how Vanitygen works. Or are you saying that a couple of FPGAs can generate "a vanity address of... a few character", I would agree that is not hard, but that bitcoin-eater address is -not- a few characters, it's nearly all of them. 
If Vanitygen + FPGAs could find the private key to the bitcoin-eater address "in a few weeks" then it would seem no one's private key would be safe if it were publicly known.

Alright let's get to the next thing that pops out to me. The header looks great btw, when I noticed the dotting texture I thought it was great, and I do like that coin image.
So, next concerns:
- Tab separation:
At the top where the tabs are, it's not easy to see what tab you're on because you removed the separating lines of the default style, and only the slight different between light gray and white gives any clue. Am I on hot, new? Hard to see. The default style has som separation there, allowing the header to poke though (?), outlines the active window/tab with, and changes the text color of the active tab, which is the biggest clue. I'm not saying you should copy the default style, but these little things in the DS are there because they really work visually and for us, and at the least your style shouldn't go backwards in useability. So if you can't improve it or create something equally good, just change the color-set(?).
- Color prominency on sidebar: 
I think the red is a bit blaring on 'what is bitcoin.' Most people will just read, they never submit a link or deal with that sidebar. Let them ignore it, tone down the color. Maybe make it a light orange? Let it blend in a bit.
Similarly, you have submit link and text-link. Link is green by text-link is gray? This would have the effect of subtly biasing links over text-links, due to color association. Text-links, being grayed, seem less favored somehow.
- Link colors in posts: 
One of the most important things for me is to see what I've already clicked on by the way the link changes color. Lets me easily scan for new content.
But when I click on yours now, it's black/black, as opposed to the default style's blue/purple. 
This definitely need to change! 
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:18:53
Yes, but they have Achilles' heels. They can influence the masses but not overtly control them. If the masses choose bitcoin, the bank-controllers simply lose.

But, they'll console themselves with still having political control. Until that too is gone.

*Sample from the Preface:*
In this *Paper* Professor Hayek considers the conditions under which it is possible for government to enlarge total expenditure by increasing the quantity of money. He argues that history indicates that, sooner or later, the control of the supply of money by government has ended in inflation. Hence the development of national and international monetary systems based on gold and other devices designed to remove from government the powers it invariably abused.
The opposite view, argued strongly in recent years in Britain, is that, if government was released from rigid mechanical rules in domestic or overseas monetary management, such as fixed exchange rates, it would be better able to act for the general good. This expectation, it is now evident, has not been realised because, although the rules were reasonably clear, government has found them politically tempting to break in practice. This is not a theoretical doubt whether government can improve on an automatic or semi-automatic monetary system, such as a gold or gold-exchange standard, in which the supply and value of money is beyond domestic political control. It is a practical judgement in political economy that a government subject to electoral pressures will not be able to observe the rules if to do so brings transitionary dislocation and unemployment.
Professor Hayek therefore argues that the time may have come to remove from government the power to require its citizens to use the money under its control. And in the last resort this would require that government be deprived of the power to define legal tender. The requirement is not to deprive government of the power to issue money but to deny it the exclusive right to do so and to force the citizenry to use it at the price it specifies. It is thus the government monopoly of money that is objectionable, and history is full of examples of governments that have attempted to enforce their power by extreme measures, including the ultimate sanction of death. 
The solution is therefore to allow people to use the money they find most convenient, whether the money issued by their own government or by other governments **[OP: *or bitcoin!*]**. Professor Hayek argues that this system would be more desirable and practicable than a utopian European Monetary Unit.

This isn't strictly true. At the most remote abstraction we can say that bitcoin was built choosing one value over another. That value is decentralized organization over centralized.
Which reflects actually an individualist philosophical choice over a socialistic-statist one.
It would've been far easier to build a digital currency that required a trusted 3rd party, it would've even been in the financial interest of the creator to do so if the currency took off.
It's likely that bitcoin was inspired by philosophy. You don't just spend years developing something radically different without some reason.

The device was designed on an FPGA, there is no 'prototype' to speak of. When you order an ASIC, you order the chip by the thousands, whereas FPGAs are small-batch friendly. 
They have in fact shown a working Mars FPGA prototype that was used to verify their ASIC design. They've ordered chips based on that design and here comes the product.
They assume an average yield and go from there. This is doable because Orsoc has a ton of experience shipping ASIC designs.

Did we nationalize the chip industry because each chip-fab costs $2billion+ to create? Or the oil industry because of the billions in development costs there? 
Nope. Cost is not an excuse for nationalization. The government cannot bring prices down in any case. Their involvement in an industry is actually correlated with rising prices.


That's nice. There are many privately funded research institutions as well.


They probably would be if they weren't being taxed to death also to provide compulsory charity to people. Historically the poor did survive on charity and aid societies. The modern welfare state has sought to replace such things via taxation and state action.


Nope. All of that can be provided better and cheaper through private industry. Even laws and courts and police! That discovery changed my life in fact.

We rate bitcoin in dollars right now because dollars are our unit of account. When the psychological shift to bitcoin is made, when it becomes your UoA psychologically, when you begin thinking in terms of bitcoin pricing, not dollar pricing, then you will not care how many dollars a bitcoin can buy, just as I don't have a clue on a daily basis how many yen you can exchange for a dollar, or how many euros. Those aren't UoAccount.
It's just a matter of use. The first people for whom bitcoin will become a UoA are those getting paid in bitcoin and whom buy things in bitcoin as a result.
So it is happening now at companies that are involved in bitcoin related businesses.
For instance, take Avalon the ASIC maker. Their first batch of Avalon ASICs you could pay in bitcoin or dollars. If you paid in bitcoin the price was something like 300 bitcoin(?) because the price in Nov'11 was pretty cheap, and it was about $1200 in dollars. But later the price for batch 3 was only 75 bitcoin, so the device got much cheaper in bitcoin terms because bitcoin had deflated during that time and was later priced at something like $40 a coin.
So price went way up in dollar terms but came way down in bitcoin terms.
It's like two trains passing in the night, and both people and businesses will begin to realize that you can either get on the bitcoin train and win as time passes due to its deflationary nature, or stay on the fiat train with the dollar and keep losing to its inflationary nature.
People will continue to choose to get on the bitcoin train. And what's more, being on that train actually lets you profit doubly so in comparison to those on the fiat train, so it makes the fiat-riding people look like dumb dupes being taken advantage of, which is a bit unfair but huge incentive to get on the train.
When everyone jumps on the bitcoin train it is the new unit of account.
Like for instance, I am planning a purchase in the future of a few hundred dollars. Knowing this I put that money immediately into bitcoin knowing that it will deflate in time and thus make my purchase actually cheaper by the time I go to do it in a few months! This is because who I want to buy from has the dollar as their unit of account and if bitcoin buys more dollars over time (deflation) the price of my desired purchase will go down over time.
If both me and the seller had bitcoin as our UoA, the price would be static and I wouldn't get the same benefit.
So again, this is major incentive to both put all money into bitcoin and take advantage of its deflationary nature in comparison to fiat, and because of its advantages will drive people into bitcoin and once there, why not spend in bitcoin rather than cashing out first to buy something. So it creates this virtuous cycle of bitcoin adoption, and the end-point is complete adoption of bitcoin as the UoA.

Nah, you have to be doing it as a business, making profit on it. The limit is something like over $1,000 a day in transfers, iirc. Mining is not money transmitting, obviously. And a one time transfer even over $1k isn't a business. You're not charging to transfer money in an exchange.

He probably still has most of it as unrealized wealth, still in bitcoin. He's just saying his current USD value in bitcoin is &gt; than $1m were he to cash out.

I don't think that means money was taken from the account. It means money was locked up by your bank as part of the transfer process. Once cancelled it's freed back to your regular balance but never actually went anywhere.
Are you saying the money wasn't put back into your bank after they cancelled the transaction? Your story has been murky on that point. If true then you'd have a real complaint.

Governments want to inflate, this lets them spend money they didn't earn.
They recruited Keynesianism to spin this policy as in the interest of the economy.
The fear of deflation is ridiculous, and just a justification for inflating. It's when you pump an economy into bubbles using inflation that then results in a popping bubble and price deflation--that sort of deflation is quite bad, as it disrupts the economy considerably and requires time for it to normalize.
But it should be realized this is caused directly by the inflationary policy that was pursued prior to that bubble.
A regular deflationary money that cannot be inflated would never experience this sort of monetary pumping bubble.
Instead, regular bitcoin inflation would actually incentivize savings. People wring their hands about most people holding bitcoin--it's actually a good thing.
Keynesians like to inflate also because people in an inflationary economy try to spend as quickly as possible money that's continually losing value. This is actually against the interest of those people--but in the interest of government whom gets to tax two transactions instead of one.
Economies grow wealthy the same way that individuals grow wealthy: by producing more than they consume. 
Incentive to save, and having that savings grow over time is in fact a desirable situation from the point of view of people who hold money. But it would not let a government obtain power, wealth, and prestige through inflation. Surprise, surprise that the gov does not like it.
An economy can deal very easily with a situation where variability is low. We know that bitcoin increases at a set rate, we won't have some central banker printing billions overnight in some misguided attempt to pump the economy.

The economy can adjust to either inflation or deflation, but only deflation isn't outright theft by a government.


No one ever said that. If bitcoin were only a tool of libertarians it wouldn't have taken off like it has. That it's in line with my political goals is only the cherry on top.


So governments prefer inflation because the masses are debtors and debtors would like their debt to become less valuable over time. But I don't think it's right to cheat those giving loans just because they're a political minority. You apparently do. Inflation or deflation should be handled by pegging debts to the % change so no one gets cheated.
There's also a difference in "deflationary cycles" when your money is credit/fiat money versus something like bitcoin. A bitcoin economy wouldn't have what's called in the wiki a deflationary cycle, as there's no central party to manipulate credit to pump the economy and cause further economic distortions. Your position rests on tenuous keynesian ground and it has been discredited by the history of economics in the 20th century.
"The non-neutrality of money in the short run can allow whoever owns the printing presses (i.e., government) to channel money to itself or favored institutions or agents. This would be a case of what's called "financial repression."... So, in short, any monetary system can be used to screw over the little guy, the gold standard included."
Bitcoin finally makes the above an impossibility since no one controls bitcoin and never can.


Krugman is an idiot who bases his entire economic understanding on a babysitting story. Seriously, look it up. Anyone quoting Krugman automatically labels themselves an economic-illiterate.

Well, bitcoin is being used disproportionately for certain gray-markets compared to mainstream currencies. That's a valid fact, but it's increasingly changing to regular transactions as the barriers to use come down. 
But the thing is, many of these gray purchases are illegal but not unethical. It's not unethical to buy and use drugs, for instance, since you own your body and thereby have full control over what drugs you use, and no one should be able to tell you what you can't use.

Regulation necessitates the bribes, actually. You don't have to bribe someone to do what you want with your own property, unless the gov gets involved.


It does it better than any other alternative. Suggest you read "For a New Liberty: the Libertarian Manifesto" by Rothbard.


This is contrary to experience. In a free market, companies are unable to crush the competition. Rather, in a controlled market the companies use regulation to attack their competitors and cement their place in the market. A free market would be a far better business climate for customers.

Yes, I understand that the number of bitcoin can't be increased.
However that doesn't mean you can't save value in bitcoin.
In practice there aren't 30 bitcoin in the world, there are millions. And when some of them are taken out of circulation, the result is deflation and the lowering of prices all around.
Everyone can still increase their supply of bitcoin, just in smaller ever more marginal amounts.
Say A, B, and C each save 1 btc a month this year, but then bitcoin deflates because everyone's doing this and now instead of being paid 10 btc a month they're being paid 1 btc a month. Great. Now they save 0.1 btc a month. Further deflation.
Soon they're saving satoshis.
Do you understand? 
They can sock away each time the same amount of *value* in ever smaller units of bitcoin because of infinite divisibility and increasing value of the unit.
You don't need an expansionary currency to save money continually.

The wallet has two things in it at least, the private key to a public address, and the public address. The public address corresponds to the blockchain's copy of how much bitcoin that address has.
Thus, after the reinstall, your bitcoin client looks up your public address on the blockchain and realizes your current balance is 0.5.
That's how it works, and that's why it works :)

Naturally, that's undoubtedly the major factor in people's jitteryness about it, and why demand is much lower than we expect in the future as it gains track record.
But it doesn't change the fact that value is in the mind of the valuer, and there do exist scenarios that could make gold worth far less, such as finding a mega-mine of it, or future asteroid mining which could, in a single discovery, find more gold than currently exists on earth in just a single asteroid.
Gold is only scarce on earth.
In that sense, bitcoin has far more reliable scarcity, its scarcity isn't geographically qualified. Its 21 million bitcoin is a hard limit across the entire universe. Unlike gold.

This is true. In the Austrian theory of money, the value of anything is made up by a confluence of several kinds of demand. 
People demand gold in small part for its industrial value, somewhat as a speculatory object or investment, and in much larger part for its value store / exchange value--those two are entwined. Gold's industrial value is vanishingly small compared to its value as money.
If bitcoin became a dominant means of value store, gold could lose quite a bit of demand in comparison, but I'm sure it would fare better than other commodities.
You go down to Argentina facing huge inflation and they will buy literally any hard good to protect the value of the money they receive--refrigerators, toasters, anything.
Bitcoin too has very, very small industrial value--the value of a small amount of electricity, and much more of its value is constituted from exchange value and value-store (inability to inflate bitcoin).

Looking at your username tho, 'bernankewasright' seriously? I think you're the one living in a fantasy.
Do you know anything about economic history at all? Fiat money has always ended in tears. Look into the experience of the French after the French revolution--barely a generation after they'd already inflated their currency to death once before but convinced themselves a democracy could get away with it.
Or the Germans before WWII.
For that matter, [get reading on this.](
It's not 'mature' to abandon your ideals as if that's what growing up meant. It is, rather, the height of responsibility to discard excuses for that which is unethical and immoral, such as institutionalized theft, and to fight for what really does make the world a better place, a world without fiat currencies and a central control of currency and government.

Bitcoin can be *made* infinitely divisible, through the addition of Tonal bitcoins, but at present it is not, and a 100 millionth coin, a 'satoshi' is the current lowest unit. But you are correct about the ability to extend the protocol to infinite division, and thus we expect bitcoin should be able to serve mankind indefinitely as a currency.

Dollar-cost average your dip. I bought a few for now and am gonna watch the price and see what happens. Been stable at ~$19 for a couple days now. I have this feeling that we're still the lucky ones.
I mean, you and I both know that had we gotten on this train a couple years back, we could have had thousands of BTC right now at virtually no cost.
That train has sailed. 
But what we don't see is that if major economies around the world continue their inflationary and deficit spending policies that BTC could become the place people flock to for fiscal sanity.
We're still well ahead of that wave. At that point, one BTC could shoot to hundreds or thousands of dollar.
In short, I see nothing but long term deflation for BTC for the rest of our lifetimes (which means its price will rise indefinitely averaged over time). Market cap is still young and small, which is GOOD, because it means we're well ahead of the wave of adoption that's yet to come. We don't even have market-cap in the billions yet. Imagine how much one BTC will be worth when the BTC market cap is measured in billions and then trillions!
It also means the future and coming deflationary waves have enormous potential for multiplying the value of even a single bitcoin. When the average person will be paid a wage in milli-bits and the idea of having an entire bitcoin is an awesome thought. Hey, I just bought ten of them--your grandchildren will be entirely awesome by such a statement when one BTC is worth a million dollars plus :P
In light of all that info, and I am trained and knowledgeable in economics, I'm not sweating a few dollars here and there today. I'm just going to continually invest in BTC with spare cash and hold for the foreseeable future.
Big things ahead.

Is any buyer afraid of getting scammed by Home Depot? Is Home Depot suddenly going to close their doors tomorrow and disappear just to scam you?
Ie: if you had a complaint, you can resolve it with Home Depot.
The point of the scam is you have no or little recourse--the scammer disappears.
Remove the ability to disappear and scamming disappears also. Businesses must trade of reputation, thus the likelihood of being scammed down the road after they start up falls dramatically.

Yes, micro means a millionth, and can be remembered because micro-bitcoins are called "Mikeys." that's 0.000001 btc.
What the writer should've said is a millibitcoin, otherwise known as a "Millie." 0.001 btc.
The market will quite naturally adapt to the necessary division rate.
Personally I think we should simply adopt the exponent system to make it compact and easy.
If you want to write millibitcoin, sure you could use "mBTC", but it's not truly clear what you mean by that. Could be micro, but it could also be mega or w/e.
How about this where " btc^-n " is equal to scientific notation, of 1 x 10^-n :
1 btc = 1.0 bitcoin
1 btc^-1 = 0.1 btc, a tenth
1 btc^-2 = 0.01 btc, a hundredth
1 btc^-3  = 0.00,1 btc, aka 1 "millie," a thousandth
1 btc^-4 = 0.00,01 btc, a ten-thousandth
1 btc^-5 = 0.00,001 btc, a hundred-thousandth
1 btc^-6 = 0.00,000,1 btc or one "mikey," a millionth
1 btc^-7 = 0.00,000,01 btc, a ten-millionth
1 btc^-8 = 0.00,000,001 btc or one "satoshi," a hundred-millionth
And currently the lowest divisible number, unless bitcoin needed to go lower (maybe a few hundred years from now) and they could do so by switching to the Tonal number system.
People will have to learn to actually count their decimals correctly :P
Ultimately it's just a matter of what you're used to. People can operate just as easily in decimals as above the decimal.

All I can tell you is that I'm prepping another $2k purchase at whatever price it's at when my money's available. Some people have called bitcoin a 'land rush.' A lot of people think it will be almost unheard of to own even a single bitcoin in the not too distant future--they'll be worth too much.
Even if the price pops, I would expect a price recovery within 12 months. So, I'm still bullish.

Whether that was a reasonable action or not would be judged by a court after you complain. Since murder is universally considered unethical, I think you'd be convicted all the same. Murder is a suprapositive ethical violation that many have argued it's not possible not to know is wrong regardless.


You'd sue for damages and estoppel of leeching.


They get what they earn, trade for, or are given. The first property is the body. Everyone earns after that. And even if they're given property, that was at one time earned by someone else.


It'll be moot by the time we venture into space. There's no end to property (in space), only we lack access to it right now.
In the meantime, use your first property, your body, to earn wealth to trade for property, that's the usual course. No one deserves to be given property outright that they didn't earn.
It's not that this is unfair so much as just a reality we must deal with. It's not humans being unfair to each other, it's unfair in some cosmic sense which human beings can't right currently.

Bitcoin doesn't have inherent value in that sense, it's true, as nothing has inherent value.
What bitcoin has are inherent qualities that may or may not be valued by other people, and one of these is its decentralized nature which makes it one of the best moneys ever created in my opinion.
Also it's low transaction-costs and being a digital-native give it an advantage for any online transactions. Most people value saving money and time, and ease of use, therefore bitcoin will go far.

Just because we've gone through a period of recent historic price-growth doesn't mean bitcoin can't have a stable price. When most people are aware of bitcoin and its economic uses are in full swing, the price will be stable, because the price is demand-dependent, and only changes in demand can cause price swings.
Bitcoin is young, so the major cause of price swings right now are confidence fluctuations. These will level off as more history builds--with time, confidence will increase as the currency proves itself, proves hardy against various forms of attack and technical glitches.
Besides, we don't need people to hold wealth in bitcoin, anymore than people hold wealth in dollars. Most wealth will always be invested in various things. By the time btc is mainstream it won't be growing like now and you'd store wealth in place with a better interest rate.


As bitcoin becomes more liquid and used more economically it will transition to becoming the unit of account. It's because most people are still dollar-centric that they use those other currencies. This is perfectly expected. Right now it's only bitcoin miners who earn their income in bitcoin that are using bitcoin as a unit of account of sorts.
If btc blows up, people start getting paid in btc, etc., then it can transition naturally to unit of account, and that would also be very hard for other alt-currencies to change.


That is true.


Depends how long they expect btc to appreciate. If btc becomes the unit of account before they 'cash out' then they no longer need to cash out, they are in the cashout currency.


It's a nice imagined scenario, but if the price dips below what the market perceives as its true value, there will also be generated mass purchase demand for whatever those people are selling. Your scenario actually requires the majority to cash out all at once, I just don't see that happening barring some unforeseen event which causes loss of confidence. Maybe some would cashout if the gov made bitcoin illegal, but personally I would consider that a great buying opportunity.
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:42:15
I think that'd still be larceny. An involuntary transfer of value has taken place. Doesn't matter that he took nothing physical, he took something virtual that didn't belong to him.

So watch the trading activity of those insiders. We do that even now. We have entire charts that do nothing but track the trading-behavior of company employees and executives as an indicator.


Actually the most important function of a market is that prices communicate. And insider trading laws hinder that price communication.

Bitcoin is built on a decentralized backbone. It doesn't matter if a corp, even one that intended evil, were to run a mining node, there's nothing they can do to hurt the system due to its decentralized nature. The corp doesn't suddenly become a trusted 3rd party because they're mining; and it is disaligned incentives that give corps a bad name sometimes, meaning when it's in the corporations financial interest to screw its customers.

Retailers use payment processors to transfer exchange risks off themselves. Bitpay already does this: price is dollars, make sale in bitcoin, receive that dollar figure deposited to your account in dollars 15 minutes later.
Moreover if the currency does deflate continually on average many retailers may be willing to simply take bitcoin, preferring it over a continually inflating paper currency. Which would you bet on? If fiat inflates ~3% a year and bitcoin deflates the same amount, that's a six point spread in favor of bitcoin. That alone can drive adoption.

I suggested recently the creation of a P2P encrypted email system which sends bitcoin with each email. If it's an email you like, you refuse the transaction, if it's spam, you take the bitcoin, thus making spam finally once and for all costly.
Want less spam, increase your fee for sending you email. Costs your friends nothing, as you can auto-whitelist them to refuse their coin. But the spammers will be SOL.
Maybe we could revolutionize email that way. I think a lot of people would be interested in a final solution for spam. And spending out of a known wallet is one way to verify an identity.

As for KNC, they've shown a working miner and seem to be legit, and they have Orsoc, an actual professional ASIC designer working with them. That gives a lot more confidence than Avalon or BFL which basically did their own designs. 
I'd buy from KNC. Do your homework too.

There may be many answers to that questions, I'll give you mine.
Probably the really big important answer is that market cap tells you about the health of bitcoin generally, and how much value people are placing on it.
In more concrete terms, a much, much larger market cap will be needed in order for even the smallest economy of an individual country to adopt bitcoin as a currency. You couldn't facilitate, for instance, oil purchases between countries with bitcoin right now because there isn't enough market cap in the currency to facilitate even a single large transaction that might rate in the billions of dollars.
Similarly, large companies can't transact in bitcoin for their largest billion dollar purchases, we're still multiples away from that.
So it's important that market cap continue to rise if mainstream adoption is ever to take place. By the time the entire world is using bitcoin it would have a market cap of probably a few trillion dollars at least. But right now, let's say Argentina's currency crashed, they would have a hard time buying bitcoin to replace their currency, because even a few large investors could mop up everything available to sell due to low market cap (even without technical considerations) and resultingly low price per indivdual bitcoi compared to how much wealth would flow into the market cap at that point. On the other hand, if that started to happen, the market cap would rapidly inflate in expectation of it increasingly rapidly.
Since the price of each bitcoin multiplies as market cap rises, people watch it because it tells you just how much promise bitcoin has for value gain in the future. One article I read recently estimated that each bitcoin could be worth $55,000 in the fairly near future if everything plays out to bitcoin's favor.

Shutting down the internet would stop bitcoin in the short term, but it's not something they could sustain long-term.
Could bitcoin transactions be smuggled out of the country on USB sticks and broadcast that way to the network? 


What I mean is he somehow needs to take the currency he receives, the Egyptian pound, and convert them into bitcoin to sell.
This would likely take the form of buying goods in the received currency and shipping them overseas to a seller that will pay him bitcoin for them. Or he could sell the cash at a discount to a privileged exporter who can do that for him and be paid in bitcoin.

A surgeon uses force to cut open his patient...
Police work isn't a "market for force," the police do not have legal sanction to use force like the police in our current society do. Free market police would not have special rights compared to a normal citizen. They can use only as much force as required to stop aggression.
Rand accepted an unethical minarchist society, and after first accepting her views and then reading Rothbard I have to seriously disagree. 
A minarchist society is not a consistently ethical society at all. And it's a shame Rand did not see this fact.
A monopoly on force is not a requirement for a society to function at all. 


I don't know why you would say that, as police would exist in a free society, they'd just be private police. And they'd have to act ethically, bring criminals to courts, etc. 
Vigilante justice implies no due process, no dispassionate 3rd party judging, etc. That's not what an-caps suggest.

Yes, this is the same reason why pooled mining works. If you find the nonce you can't simply drop out of the pool and use it for yourself, the nonce only works with a given address. Try to change the address and the nonce doesn't work, and the address is the pool operator's address.

Most likely you will be able to, in fact. Using cellphones and NFC technology, payment systems using bitcoin are already on the horizon. And they won't immediately threaten the dollar because it will be instant conversion into and from dollars at the point of sale.
Who they'll threaten is Mastercard and Visa, who might try to use their influence on the government to make bitcoin illegal, so we'll see.
Or Visa and MC might simply embrace bitcoin and make it core to their business somehow, ultimately failing to corrupt it and passing away, much as Walmart swept away the ma and pa stores of the world.

Somalia had the political situation but not the ideas to create a libertarian society. It soon reverted to federalism and a centralizing government, which is where it [stands today](
If I was going to build a libertarian society it would be in a seastead where no existing jurisdiction had ever existed before, with people whom were not warlike like the Somalis but rather similarly ideologically motivated to build something entirely new along libertarian ideals.
In the same way that fiat currency cannot be gotten rid of without the idea of bitcoin, having a central government is better than having outright chaos. But when something better comes along even fiat currencies and central governments will be replaced, the one by bitcoin, the other by political-individualism.

Not exactly sure. Here's the extent of my knowledge on that: some clients actually enforce a minimum transfer fee, or require manual adjustment to change that? Never tried it. But I know if you put a coin into Blockchain.info that you can input the transfer fee there as nothing when sending from there.
I have read of people who put zero transfer fee and were wondering what would happen. It took less than a day to confirm, hours at best. And I know that individual miners can allot processing space for transactions with no transfer fee, including not processing them at all (but they have incentive to include them due to the block reward). 
So, it can be done. I've never tried it. I suggest Blockchain.info to try it.

You have an 80-90 percent chance of the transaction going through no problem. That figure is improved considerably if you've done one or more transactions with them already.
I've never had a transaction rejected so far, fingers crossed.
You always hear from the vocal minority, but most people have had no problem with Coinbase, except for the fact that they're ALWAYS out of coins it seems! The one time I was able to buy as many coin as wanted seemed to be on monday, weirdly enough :P I've guessing people were bracing for a price drop and no-one wanted to buy.

Bitcoin's growth took years too.
Exponential growth *won't* last, but experiencing it for a time doesn't mean something is immediately wrong.
Bitcoin has clear value--it offers the lowest possible transaction costs for online transactions, bar none. It also eliminates risk of charge-back and misc. spending-fraud.


The market is bidding the price up in expectation of this eventuality. Pricing on forecasting. It will level off as uptake materializes and build into steady growth as it roots.
From then on it will slowly deflate in value over time as wealth is generated and more and more people come to demand it simply as a medium of exchange, and as the number of humanity increases it will deflate as well.

Sounds like a compromised computer. Were you obtaining these btc on 'free bitcoin' and 'earn bitcoin' sites?
More dependable than keeping your wallet on your PC is using a cold storage wallet. Checkout for tons of options and info.


Probably not. A wallet file has a hundred addresses in it, most are hidden from you for convenience factor. But a cold storage wallet only ever has one address. Much simpler.
The encrypted wallet is good, but you've gotta keep a backup, and what's more re-back it up every time you make a sale, as it may generate new addresses everytime you spend (for receiving change purposes due to how a bitcoin transaction works).
If you had a backup and strong encryption, we could be walking you through recovering those bitcoin right now. Live and learn. 
Do some more research on wallets.

There is only one legitimate use of force: defensive coercion to stop aggressive coercion.
As was said, governments were instituted to protect from aggressors inside and outside society. To this end they were given the legal power of coercion.
However they've proven themselves unworthy of it. They cannot be trusted with it, and increasingly have become aggressors themselves, or the tools of aggressors. Voters themselves have become aggressors through the law, engaging in class warfare against the rich for example, voting largesse to themselves at the expense of those whom on the whole earned it legitimately.
It is time to end this farce that we call democracy.
It is time for individualism to make its mark in political theory via the rejection of the idea that one person should have power to compel another to do anything against their will or to violate their rights without consequences (ie: taxation).
Legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed, but that has a natural corollary: if I withdraw my consent then government has no legitimacy and thus has no more power over me. However we live in a system that claims power over everyone whether they receive their consent or not, and thus the system has become an aggressor in their own right.
This ill and rotted system must be excised like the political cancer it is before it brings down the whole society.
But it will not be libertarians that do it. No, we are keen to let that cancer spread and become terminal--all we ask is to be left alone as we walk away.

That's the thing, the guys heading KNC are long-time ASIC designers. This SHA-256 isn't even close to the toughest ASIC they've designed and shipped.
Who designed BFL's chip? No one knows. Avalon basically did it in-house but clearly had more success at least.


Orsoc's been around for over a decade now, an ASIC and FPGA design house with a large following.


28nm is 2011 tech, it's not too surprising. And bitcoin mining doesn't have broad enough demand for big companies to devote their cutting edge fabs to it, like 14nm or something.

Supply is outstripping demand, thus the price is falling.


Why do you think the difficulty raising will change ASIC miners behavior?
The difficulty going up makes mining more expensive for everyone, since they get less bitcoin, or if they keep their percentage of the total the same their fixed electricity costs go up. And if the price of bitcoin goes down they must sell more bitcoin than before to cover their fixed electricity expenses. So in either case they must sell bitcoin, and the price going down and the diff going up both cause more bitcoin to be sold.
Also, the number of bitcoin mined per day is constant regardless of difficulty.

Of course we'll have to start dividing. I think a day will come that we'll see where holding one bitcoin will be rather exceptional. Holding bitcoin early simply pays you for being an early adopter, for being farsighted. Just like buying land you suspect contains oil might make you rich.
If you spread all 21m bitcoin between 7 billion people you'd give each person a mere 3 millies: 0.003 BTC.
And that would have to equal the average pay worldwide of about $10,000, meaning that one dollar equivalent in bitcoin at that point would be three ten-millionths of a bitcoin, or 0.0000003 BTC = $1 &gt;_&gt;
Who knows how long it will take, or what might happen, before worldwide adoption of Bitcoin, but I consider it likely from an economic point of view.
As an uncontrollable and uninflateable currency, it has far more stable monetary policy compared to all other currencies in the world. And that's to the benefit of purchasers, putting buyers and sellers on an even foot.
The fiat currencies of today are designed to appeal to segments of society with the most political power: ie, the average voter. Thus a policy of inflation is pursued, as it makes loans cheaper over time.
The best strategy is hands off, pure laissez faire, which advantages neither side.

Marxist socialism, yes. Socialism's roots are in anarchism however, which abhorred the state, and you still get some left socialists suspicious of state power, but where they fail is they don't understand economics and theories of production. Instead they focus purely on distribution of wealth and equality as a moral imperative that makes the use of force to achieve economic equality somehow okay (not to my mind tho).

@_date: 2013-04-24 02:43:18
What you're talking about is when bitcoin becomes a unit of account in an economy. We're far from that happening right now, but that doesn't make bitcoin a fiat currency. It's not fiat because no one controls bitcoin, there's no entity behind it manipulating it. Just as gold is not fiat because it's supply is controlled by the laws of nature, so bitcoin's supply is controlled by the laws of mathematics.
Since no one can control bitcoin and it's not subject to politics or tied to the fate of some company, people are willing to trust it much more than a fiat currency.
In time this will mean a transition to it as a unit of account, just like, say, the Russians adopted the dollar after the fall of the Soviet Union when their money fell apart along with the fortunes of the Russian state at that time.
Retailers need to pay suppliers in dollars right now. That may change if b2b transactions begin adopting bitcoin. Then employees can get paid in bitcoin too. Do that enough and it's your new unit of account.

To my thinking, it could accomodate cities in the billions if need be, collections of micro-cities all bordering one another. It should prove extremely hardy and adaptable.




Well, we can look at the historical example of the railroads, which were private. The railroads all got together and established standards voluntarily, and even setup track sharing agreements without prompting, and complex rules of signalling, etc.
Likely the road owners would do that same thing.
As for navigating, I expect that the use of roads would be far easier than most think. As I hinted at before, it's probably that side streets would be free, and you'd only pay for highways and expressways. Businesses don't want barrier to entry to their areas, so they'd pay for roads there and only charge commercial customers.
Ultimately I think most people would subscribe to a road-managing organization, paying a small fee per month for unlimited use, or perhaps metered use, it would be up to the communities. But you'd end up paying less in voluntary subscriptions than you do now in taxes for roads.
Things are even easier in a seasteader society where a 'road' is just a patch of open ocean that can't be damaged effectively.

Sure, but that will also make it easier to mark them indelibly. Because you can impregnate a marker within the body of the device, throughout its entirety, that gives it a unique tracking number.
As an example, we have firearms with a number stamped on them, and crooks just grind them off. But what if there were a unique number impregnated within the very metal of the gun, throughout, say one part per million. It would be impossible to grind that off or otherwise obscure it as it permeates the device entirely.
Such a concept would be akin to giving unique DNA to manufactured objects. 
I think a similar concept was shown in *Bladerunner*, the snake-scale identification scene.

Nono, Gox is higher priced *because no one can cash out,* ie: no one can sell their bitcoin for dollars.
Think about that. People there are holding bitcoin because they know they can't get dollars. They'd probably like to cash-out, and then the price would come down to the other exchanges' level, but they cannot. The price on Gox is artificially high in fact therefore. And this is not a good thing at all.
Now you'd be right entirely if Gox were allowing cashout right now, but the spread would never be so large from that factor alone.

You started this exchange doing the same thing. It's hardly appropriate to start calling foul now :P
 &gt;I hold a moderate position, you hold a more extreme one. The only point I was trying to make is that in first world civilized society the political leaders that are elected end up as moderates because there's so many different people with varying cultures, beliefs and viewpoints and so much nuance in between that it would be quite unfair and unrepresentative of the population at whole to enforce a minority position on the entire society.
Yes, in my ideal society there would be no representational politics, but rather direct law-production. Each person would decide for themselves what law set to live by, rather than voting for someone who they must then trust to pass laws over them and cannot resist those laws from that point in any other way that by later voting for someone else who also has no duty to repeal laws or pass any specific laws.


True, and I have no interest in forcing any position on anyone. At the same time, it's not more ethical to force the majority position on anyone--I reject that use of force as well. You don't reject that unethical use of force and are thus clearly unenlightened.

Yes in the sense that all value requires a valuer. But no in the sense that there are good reasons to value bitcoin because of features of the currency:
Bitcoins are valued because they offer the lowest possible transaction cost for digital transactions compared to all other currencies.

Brainwallets are one of the few easy ways to lose your coins.
If you choose an easy passphrase as the seed, anyone who can duplicate that passphrase, on purpose or by accident, can take your funds.
It's a bit like hiding your money in a cave that you know the location to. As long as no one else looks in there, your money's safe.
Whereas, generating a truly random passphrase is a bit more like choose a random star in the universe and putting your money in a heat-proof safe at the center of the star. Even if you knew which star it was in, getting it out is nearly impossible, and that would be the easy part :P

I suggest anyone interested in the reasons why political systems find it irresistible to inflate the currency, and how it must inevitably end, read this essay on the double experience of France with fiat money over 100 years ago, entitled, ["Fiat Money Inflation in France"]( by Andrew Dickson White (free ebook available at that link).












The answer isn't "elect better politicians" since they will face the same incentives and thereby use the same "solutions" to political problems: inflation. Which is why repub and democrat are both inflaters, despite a few on the right who understand what's at stake. 
No, the answer is a structural change in finance that makes inflating and currency control impossible.
Bitcoin is that structural change.

I'll buy a guy (self-defense) or else, if I can afford it, hire an organization to provide regional security, along with others so that it's cheaper.
As for rules, it would be part of the contract with that group, and if they violated them I could sue for damages, unlike with current police, and if I didn't like them I could hire another group entirely. Try telling the LAPD you don't want them taking your tax money anymore, despite them being quite obviously corrupt to the nth degree.


What I suggest is somewhat close to competing governments, but really it's more competing free associations and organizations, since there's no agency of force that could be called government.
You can build any kind of existing government under the system I propose. As long as it's voluntary you could agree to be taxed, you could agree to universal health-care. I don't mind.
As long as you aren't trying to force me or others who don't want to be under that system, more power to you. My objection comes when such people try to force me and others into their system. Leave me alone. You have no right.

Yes in the sense that all value requires a valuer. But no in the sense that there are good reasons to value bitcoin because of features of the currency:
Bitcoins are valued because they offer the lowest possible transaction cost for digital transactions compared to all other currencies.

How do we pay for them now? People earn money and then are taxed. However they're paying the government to provide a service, and the government both holds a monopoly on that service and tells people how much they will pay, meaning that people are paying the highest possible price--a monopoly price--for the lowest possible service--monopoly service.
So, if you were paying from your paycheck yourself rather than taxed, you'd both pay less and receive far higher quality of service for your money.


Those who don't want to could provide their own protection. Do-it-yourself protection would mean things like owning a gun, etc.


If people could own everything privately, including streets, neighborhoods, etc., then they would be able to prevent people from entering who refuse to help pay the security provider--much like people who live in large gated communities agree to pay for security and gate-guards in those communities.
Similarly, in ["Machinery of Freedom"]( David Friedman explains how certain triggering-contracts can be used to have an entire community support an objective and minimize or eliminate the free-rider tendency, by, for instance, having a contract that doesn't trigger unless say 95% of people in a region agree to be bound by it, or even 100% if you want (free ebook at that link btw).


This may or may not be true, I don't know. There's nothing to stop a whole community from banding together as a corporation and contracting with a particular security company. Alternately piecemeal security is a possibility as well. You'd likely have companies specializing in general and piecemeal security, much as we have now where there are the state police whom patrol widely and then targeted security companies that keep staff on-site at contract locations. 
The point is, it's doable. You don't -need- government to do it. It may be harder, but that doesn't mean it would be undoable. Security exists because people demand it as a service, they don't gripe about paying for police. Similarly, without government they would still demand on the market security for themselves, and would buy it absent governments.


Democracy is inherently unethical. It must be abolished. This was a shocking idea to me when I encountered it, so bear with me. If you own yourself, what right does anyone have to force things on you? None. What does democracy do? It says that the will of the majority will be forced on the minority. It is then inherently aggressive, forceful, coercion, and unethical.
The Founders knew this, they tried to balance democracy with individual rights, but it's clear that this has not worked. Each day more rights are trampled on, because the very people trusted with the exercise of government power are the same people tasked with protecting individual rights, and this is a major flaw in all democracies existent today.
The very idea that anyone can force laws on anyone else must come to be recognize as the evil it is, as equally as if one person forced his fist into another's face.


You will never achieve that, because as long as one person, the politician, can force laws on another person, he may do so in his own interest and against the interest of the other person. He may also be lobbied by others to pass laws that benefit them and hurt you.
The only person that will always be fair to you, is you. The only person that will never knowingly pass harmful laws over you, is you. How much could we bribe you to pass a law that would you? Why, no amount at all. We could not lobby you to do something that you knew was obviously against your interest. All the schemes of the lobbyists are foiled only, only if we reject the principle of one person forcing laws on others. Any other legal arrangement leads to abuses inevitably.


What could be more direct than absolute control over your own legal circumstances? The problem with your conception of direct democracy is that it is collectivist. You would grant the community the power to force individuals to do what the community decides, as if the community owned each person in part, as if people did not wholly own themselves. Autarchy takes the idea of direct democracy to its ultimate extent: each person has complete power over their own legal circumstances.


Again, democracy is unethical. It is force.


Imagine everyone deciding for me how I will live. No thank you. Imagine each person deciding their own personal constitution. That's my dream. Would they largely choose the same laws? Yes. Thus, it all works out.


So there would still be the unethical use of taxation in your system? Where the wealth one person produces is extorted from them by force simply because the group decides it's okay to do so? If theft is okay because the majority votes to do it, would rape be okay because the majority votes to do it? Would murder be okay? What makes theft special?


Not the one I propose, where people who agree politically would likely end up banding together into tight-knit communities of legal agreement.
You direly need to read For a [New Liberty]( and [Ethics of Liberty]( (both available free at those links as an ebook) to shed these minarchist thoughts.
I remember being where you were, thinking we needed a minimal state, not being able to imagine dispensing with it entirely. What I discovered changed everything for me.

Iirc, in Nov bitcoin was ~$11 per. 
Plugging in the figures I get a return of ROI of 5.5btc max:
However, the diff might be accelerated considerably if KNC ships in September. 
Your device makes almost all its return in the first three months. If you advance the ship date a month or two to simulate KNC shipping in September bringing the diff quickly close too 200, the return is still positive but barely over half a bitcoin. 
Guess we'll see. KNC announced today they're on track for shipping in September, btw.
The same $170 in Nov would've bought about 15 bitcoin. So, you'd have been better off with buying bitcoin most likely.

Yeah I [did the math]( recently on this. 
If we assume population (7 billion people), world GDP ($70 trillion), and world average income ($10,000 /per) all remain the same and that all bitcoins are already mined (21m coins), then the numbers work out such that if bitcoin were to replace all global currencies, then we'd have to split them down into millies: ฿0.003 per person, where three millions equal the global average income of $10,000. To further split three millies 10,000 times would look like this: ฿0.0000003 = $1.
I think that's easier to read using notation, which would look like this: ฿^-7 3. Three ten-millionth bits = today's $1.
All of that means that one ฿ could be worth many millions of dollars in the future.
And population, world gdp, and world average salary are only going to increase, meanwhile bitcoin's available will be much smaller and continually decrease due to lost coins, meaning these numbers are conservative. But who knows how long world-wide uptake will take. 
Could be long and drawn out over decades, or could be a sudden cascade where one currency failing causes others to fail, and the system inverts causing the masses to rush to a digital currency.
If that happens, we early adopters are the *new money*.

Not necessarily. People would still like their money to grow over and above the deflation. Thus they will still tend to invest. Ie: if 2% growth is good by just holding your money in cold storage, 5%+ by investing it is excellent.
And higher returns draw more capital into that investment. The same investment with an inflationary currency might only return 2%, but with bitcoin it's returning 5% or more! That will draw investment capital. It's not like AsicMiner had any shortage of investors.
And they'll make much more money than if investing in an inflationary currency which constantly steals a couple percent from them every year.
Thus, in a short decade or two, there's far more money being invested because it's not being siphoned off by the gov.

[Here's]( a good discussion of vanity addresses on &gt; I notice that it flys through thousands of address/key pairs, giving me the understanding that the wallet-ket pairs for hundreds of addresses are pre-determined, is this right?
What it's doing is generating private keys from a random algorithm and then from those generating the public address and checking to see if it matches the vanity you want.
There are so many possible addresses that this is not a viable way to discover someone's private key if you know only the public address.


No, you encrypt a wallet so that if someone gains access to it they cannot immediately spend out of it.
There are something like 2^60 (2E60) possible public addresses. It's a number so big that it would take thousands of years to find the private key for one public address.
But if you only want to make a vanity address with a few specific characters, it's doable, just the difficulty and time needed multiply rapidly with each new character added.

Let each individual create laws for themselves. Then there's no ability for anyone to fuck your over with the law since you aren't likely to screw yourself on purpose.
All the political problems we have stem from giving a 3rd party power over us. Ironically, it is the rejection of 3rd-party trust that inspired bitcoin.
A democracy is inherently socialistic, because it seeks to place the will of the social whole as superior to the will of the individual (or minority), and it is also immoral because it goes on to force the will of the whole on the individual. America has been socialist from the beginning, and democracy must be rejected in order for the next epoch of humanity to begin. And it will be created along libertarian and individualist lines. And bitcoin will facilitate that.
This is not a choice between having government and letting the more powerful run society as you suggest. There would still be law, only it is now voluntary law rather than coerced/forced law. There would still be police but they would not be monopoly government police, they'd be free market citizen police.

It's not just space, it's spacetime. Time began with the big bang and is itself accelerating out into the mists along with the boundary of space.
Whatever's beyond the boundaries of space has no time, thus it's not a place you could even go to.
So, as I say, the universe may have room to expand infinitely, but my point is that the universe is not itself presently infinite. Unless you want to conflate the universe, that is spacetime, and what it's expanding into, which I would not, for it is not a visitable place. It's not technically a place at all without time. It is outside of time.

Democracy has an inherent ethical problem however in that it forces policies on the minority which doesn't want them, constituting political aggression.
A better society is a society which has no institutional aggression.
There is no form of democracy I'm aware of that doesn't contain this inherent ethical flaw.
What's revealed is that democracy is an inherently communalist structure, which puts the will of the collective over that of the individual.
What I'm looking for is an individualist structured society that does not force collective will on the individual dissenter, but allows them to live as they desire.
Every democracy fails that test.
We need to move beyond democracy to new forms.

In economic terms, it really is the most perfect form of money thus far created!
Almost everything has been used as money at some point in the past, every commodity, every good. We've used salt, wheat, iron, sand, nails, seriously, name it, we've used it. Tulips! Also yes.
Money needs to be a couple things:
- Durable
- Low mass in comparison to its value 
- Transportable
- Testable
- Divisible
- Standardizable
- Widely accepted
I'm sure there are other criteria one could use, but I'll stick with these for now.
It's easy to see why gold excelled as money. It's extremely durable, being non-oxidizing. Bitcoin by contrast is as durable as you can make any piece of information. Information is a spiritual quality, but that info must be encoded in physical form to last, but that form can change infinitely. So bitcoin is technically more durable than gold, and gold is already quite durable. 
As for being low mass, gold excels here, being heavy in relation to its size. This also helped people determine gold from fake gold, as nothing was as heavy. Bitcoin by contrast is massless, with an essentially infinite mass to value ratio.
As for transport, gold starts to lag here. Gold is very heavy in quantity, and not easily transported. Bitcoin by contrast is the most transportable form of money ever invented. Since bitcoin is an idea it can actually exist solely in your head, being transported *by thought*. Find another form of money that can do that!
What's more, transporting gold digitally is impossible--whereas bitcoin is natively digital. If you use gold as money online you still have to transport it physically later. Not so good. You aren't actually using gold as money in that case, you're using a claim on gold, and those claims are little better than fiat money, they can be inflated and you must trust a 3rd party not to abuse their ability to issue receipts for each piece of gold.
When merchants use gold they must learn how to test that gold at point of sale for purity. You can see here a [Fisch test gauge]( that embeds three tests in a simple device allowing one to detect fake gold coins.
What's more, there was recently discovered gold being sold to banks that had been faked with tungsten and other heavy metals and a thin layer of gold over-top, to make it weigh the same, etc. 
Try that with bitcoin. Bitcoin is easily proved to be real through a simple computation done on the blockchain, and sent irreversibly--one of the main problems with digital forms of money today, scams via chargebacks.
As for division, this is a huge problem for gold. As gold becomes more valuable--its supply being quite limited--the coins became smaller and smaller. Eventually you'd be spending coins the size of a pinhead, or switching to other metals.
Bitcoin by contrast is not just extremely divisible already, but with the Tonal numbering system is apparently actually infinitely divisible, and can thus serve the needs of humanity for the foreseeable future: the entire future-history of humanity, if need be, absorbing all future deflation without problem.
As for standard's, this was another problem. You had merchants weighing gold, but you had to trust that their scales were fair. Or you had countries minting gold coins, but then people were shaving the coins! You can't shave a bitcoin however.
And widely accepted--which of course gold is not anymore. Governments at times made gold ownership illegal! 
In addition to all this, gold is beautiful, and bitcoin too has a beauty of sorts, in its mathematical character.
I tell you, bitcoin's status as the most perfect currency ever created is one of the prime reasons I am so bullish on bitcoin.

Coinbase is notoriously slow moving coins out of their system--at least a half hour. 7 hours sounds like an outlier.
Yes, no one should be using Coinbase to pay a Bitpay invoice, since Bitpay requires payment broadcast on the network within 15 minutes. That's not even in Coinbase's best-case-scenario timeframe.
What I did was move coins from Coinbase to Blockchain.info and then pay Bitpay using Blockchain's wallet.

When they paid into the system via taxation, it was there's just prior to that point and was then taken. You can't says it was never theirs, they worked for that before it was taken. It was rightfully theirs, even if take at that point when they were about to take receipt of it.
The fact that it was being given to them by the employer but then intercepted means they had legal right to it, thus owned it, and the control in that sense was to direct the money to be given to them on a continual basis.
That control was abrogated by a government law, an unethical law.
Their title was violated by force.
In exchange for taking their title they were given a promise that no one can say whether it is any good or not. And they had no choice in that.

Especially with URI links now!
The only thing it doesn't do that Bitpay does is Bitpay's page automatically looks for the broadcast transaction, whereas Coinbase's page asks you to hit a button first after you've sent the transaction. Bitpay's service is just a touch slicker in that regard :) It just works.

You're missing an essential differentiator, however.
In the system I propose, the locus of control is with the individual. It is a political system predicated on individualism, and thus escapes the negative incentives and corruption problems, et al., created by democracy which is inherently a collectivist system.
What you call collectivism in this comment is actually just association. I assume that people will continue to associate with each other, ie: gather in large communities, groups, and cities, whether the system the society runs on is collectivist or individualist. Because there are numerous advantages to associating with each other.
It's not that communities can't work, it's that a collectivist political system does not work as well as an individualist one.
It's not that communities are collectivist--they aren't inherently--but when you run them on the basis of majority vote then they are run collectively.
It's perfectly possible to run a community on an individualist basis. And the effect of doing so is to create an easy path to political change for each person.
The result is that the individual will of each person to live in the sort of community they desire will no longer be frustrated by being completely beholden to the will of the wider majority.
Political experimentation will flower, a thousand new and different communities will expand from nothing.
Whereas democracy tends towards both conserving existing norms, catering to the lowest common denominator, and continually moving towards destruction due to the corruption-incentives given to politicians, an autarchy (the word for the system I propose) lends itself to radical and immediate political change, catering to each individual, and reversing corruption-causing incentives to remove corruption entirely.
I hope that helps clear up the misunderstanding.

If governments create their own crypto currency, it would be one without a blockchain, because they want to be the trusted 3rd party, as it's the only way they can maintain control over the currency.

No. You're wrong.
Fiat is where the law is used to give something value.

Ethically, it's true. There is no force involved in the voluntary transfer of money, of which money laundering is an instance. Thus there is no crime in the movement of money itself.


Sure, and the actual crime in that statement is just that, the crime itself. No one is hurt by moving money. The actual harm was in the crime that generated the money.


You have to know they're a fugitive for that. No bank just taking money knows it's source, money is neutral in that regard, generally speaking. And escaping justice is itself a crime, whereas transferring money resulting from a crime is not.

That depends on how much they need to hold Bolivars. They could start selling and buying commodities from other companies in bitcoin, pay the taxes in bolivars they get from retail channels, and convert the rest into bitcoin via commodity exports or the like.

Obtain an estoppel judgment. Done deal.


Tragedy of the commons is solved by having no commons.


Nah, the judgment against you is about who has the right to use force to right a damage. That could be in monetary form, but if someone's outside the jurisdiction causing harm and refusing to come to court, they've chosen force over negotiation, and thus an estoppel judgment would be the way to handle it, and it would legitimize going to the source to stop the contamination.
Just as when an American court judgment is accepted as valid by a Canadian court, the same would pertain in such a society.

As sellers sell them coins they release the same coins to be bought. So it's always happening all day long. Try to buy in as small amounts as possible, 10 or 5 bitcoin, even 1, when things are tough. If you try to buy 100, they will tell you they're out of coins, even if they actually have 99 coins in stock! So start with your max number wanted and then roll it down and buy in smaller lots rather than one bulk lot.

Not different enough from bitcoin to challenge it in any meaningful way in the future. If the idea of a cyptocurrency achieves mass penetration it will be bitcoin, not litecoin, that does so. The network effect means that any challenge not significantly technologically superior will not be able to challenge bitcoin long run.
I see Litecoin's current market-cap as a hedge-blip. Something that will drain away as it becomes obvious that bitcoin has won and achieved market penetration. Already the bitcoin's market cap blows away litecoin's.
The bandwagon effect and path dependence are also heavily in bitcoin's favor. It's already the standout and that isn't likely to change.
A true competitor to bitcoin that would make any of us worried would have to be structurally different in an entirely new way, not merely one of the alt-coin *codycats* (to coin a term).

Manipulation only works to the extent that the market isn't wised up by it.
Any attempt at manipulation functions as inoculation for future attempts, because if X attempt is repeated often enough, the pattern becomes obvious and creates arbitrage opportunities allowing others to profit and in return generating counter-pressure against the original tactic, thus smoothing it out.
This works because a repeated X attempt allows other trades to 'predict the future' successfully, since X attempt has a predictable signature and pattern to it (say, pump and dump).

No, and this is something I only began to realize recently.
As the number of transactions goes up, and the price of bitcoin goes up, mining becomes more profitable even without the block reward.
It won't be an oligopoly because the whole network of mining is luck-based. No small group of entities can capture the whole mining market.
Transaction costs are lower because of the removal of 3rd party trust, because transactions are public on the blockchain and thus the whole back-end chain of trust between financial institutions to complete payments is done away with--all replaced with an entry on the blockchain.

If the gov print say a billion dollars, the value in that billion is actually stolen from every other bill in existence in the hands of the populace in general.
Thus inflation is actually theft by degree.
It is not wealth distribution at all, quite the opposite. It is a loss of wealth on the part of everyone.
If the gov prints a billion dollars--and they print much more than that--that value is coming from people who worked for it, stolen from them invisibly by inflation.

But I know for the Avalon rigs, they are targeted at 100% ROI within 30 days &gt;_&gt; That's so you can hedge against difficulty increases between order time and receiving.
But it is possible. If the price keeps going up, an Avalon 4-unit has like a 12 days ROI. That link I gave you is what you'd be making if you had an Avalon 4-unit right now essentially.

Not really, no, since all that could happen is the price be so stable and market cap so high that buying in gives them little to no gains in value per bitcoin. But buying in would function as a value store nonetheless.
There is however incentive for getting in early, as the earliest people in will see the biggest gains. It's actually a pretty nice system.
The free market rewards those with vision. This isn't exploitation. If you bet on bitcoin early and it pans out, good for you.

Sell walls aren't necessarily 'real.' They could be there to manipulate expectations.
Although recently Mt. Gox setup the rules to where you couldn't create sell/buy walls at a higher amount than what you had to fund that wall, so maybe things have changed lately.

Or they could stand and the market price will stall there while buys chew through the wall over time. Plenty of that has happened too.

I'd argue a policy can be dictatorial even if the people voted for it, for they may be deceived or the like. Governments get away with financial crimes because most people don't understand finance. That's what intellectuals are for, people who understand and who can call a spade a spade and make a case for the abuse they see happening.
If the government is substituting its will for the will of the people to do something unethical, against their interests, and preventing them from escaping the consequences thereof, I call that tyranny.
Under such a definition, every state that inflates is tyrannical, for inflation via money printing is theft of value, a clearly unethical thing to do. And all states do it that control a currency. And that's just the beginning.

Hoarding is not hoarding, hoarding is saving :P The idea behind saving is that when you feel it's in your interest to spend rather than save, you'll spend, and otherwise you'll save.
But there's no existential systemic risk to saving like there is to a debt-based economy. Quite the opposite in fact. A savings-based economy has lots of money to invest in projects more profitable than the deflation-rate you'd get by saving in a deflationary money, which would winnow out the marginal ones and direct money towards truly productive ones.

Here's the thing, democracy is inherently a tool of socialism, because it puts the social unit before the individual by virtue of the 'majority rules' mechanism, which legitimates forcing laws on those who don't consent to them. 
If you build a political system predicated on socialism, as with our democracy, a socialist device, it's going to tend towards greater and greater socialism, meaning more centralization and creeping control over daily life. 
There's no way to fix that using a constitution. I spent 20 years trying to find a way to fix that before concluding it was impossible and discovering another path entirely into political individualism which does away with democracy.
If you build a political order predicated on individualism, then it will tend towards individualism over time.
What the founders wanted was a society of individualism, then along came the Federalists, who were not the same group, and they connived their way to passing the Constitution, an instrument of virtually unlimited power.
When Franklin joined the 2nd constitutional convention he asked to read a copy of the proposed document and upon finishing stood to speak and said, (paraphrasing) he found three places where unbridled power had been granted: in the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial.
But his concerns were brushed aside and he signed reluctantly in the end. 
The Constitution was a noble experiment for its day, but we know now that it has failed utterly. It is time for a new experiment, not of democracy nor socialism, but of political individualism, something the world has never seen but glimpses of.

Bitcoin offers the lowest possible transaction costs of all competing currencies. It's some 2% - 4% cheaper than using a credit card, for instance.
The same infrastructure that currently makes credit card transactions possible could very easily pivot to function with bitcoin. In fact, market incentives will drive businesses to it unless regional legal problems develop due to it being the lowest transaction-cost currency.
Beyond that, people value both enhanced privacy, lack or 3rd party trust, and the assurance of not having your money seized by the bank you trust to keep it, nor worrying about inflation much less an outright devaluation.
Of these, low transaction costs and the removal of 3rd party trust are the most important and will drive adoption, especially in a time of high inflation, untrustable banks and governments, and economic turmoil, which coincidentally we find ourselves right in the middle of on a global scale!

The flaw in your reasoning is adding the known usage.
If I sell you some spray-paint, I have no knowledge of your use of it, it's strictly business.
But if you tell someone during purchase you intend to tag on other people's property with it, many of them will refuse to sell you that paint on principle.
Most things in the world can be used ethically or unethically. It's not the fault of the seller if you use something they sold you unethically, though many will refuse to do so if they suspect you of it.
So whether they do or not, they're not necessarily party to the crime that later occurs.
So, such sale is still ethical. But for something like plutonium I'd assume a seller would want to make doubly sure, since being wrong would bring a lot of social pressure down on him.


If you sell someone a bullet, you assume it will likely be used to shoot at another living thing.
But such shooting is not *prima facie* unethical, it's the context it's found in.
You chose a context in which use is *always unethical*, ie: a dirty bomb, for it targets indiscriminately via a geographic region.
That's a different kind of sale from those selling things which are always ethical, such as gambling. Because if one gambles, one only hurts themself, not others.

The two go hand in hand, actually.
More exchange and commerce, more velocity of exchange, means more demand overall, and since supply is fixed means a higher price.
Furthermore, there are uses for bitcoin that can't happen until bitcoin's market cap is significantly higher, and thus the price must go up for those things to happen, and those things happening will again significantly increase commerce and use, and thereby demand.
It's a virtuous cycle, but don't think the price of bitcoin can remain at $100 if it's going to see mainstream uptake any-time soon.

Bitcoin is not merely buoyed by confidence in a system. It's the guarantee of uninflateability, and the fact of lower transactions costs that causes people to value the system.
Ultimately everyone will benefit by using bitcoin because it raises overall efficiency of transactions by virtue of lower transaction costs and remove risk of chargebacks and things like that. Gone are the 5-day waits for bank-transfers, etc.
Those who benefit most by fiat often also don't understand that they're doing so--the politicians that engage in it. And those that benefit from it directly, the bankers, have a profit motive and would respond to the incentive.
Besides, it's still perfectly possible for rich people to cash out into commodities and property and use bitcoin as equally as any other currency. There's just a small slice of people who benefit from fiat, but they cannot benefit as much from fiat as all of us will benefit from bitcoin.
And thus they are destined to lose this fight. Because bitcoin is an idea and cannot be destroyed, only delayed. Even if they took down this bitcoin, two more hydra heads would rise in its place.
Bitcoin will take down fiat like democracy once took down monarchies (and hopefully democracy itself will be replaced in due time with something better as well).

That's pretty close to what I'm talking about. If you control your legal circumstances entirely there's no room for another person to have a say in it, and thus no voting. 
Implicit in your statement still is an assumption of collective decision making--which necessitates voting. But I think politics will grow increasingly individualist, giving each person power over their own legal circumstances and avoiding collectivist decisions, thus no voting.
Instead, each person is a sovereign over themselves and their legal circumstances. It means a rejection of the idea that anyone else can force things on you. We already recognize that principle physically--no one can force food on you, or attack you, etc., but we do not yet broadly recognize the evil that is *forcing laws* on someone.
But we will.

Money shortages are largely imaginary. The only way money could truly be short is if you deflate down to the smallest denomination and there's nothing below even though you need there to be.
In your scenario, gold would become more valuable all around. It's true that the higher price of gold then would make mining gold profitable again, but that's really secondary and not necessary for an economy to function.


Nah, that's the Keynesian line but we ran a deflationary economy for over 100 years in the 19th century and didn't experience that, quite the opposite.

Sort of. In practice I think people would group together in communities that have accepted mutual ground rules.
Laws generally will govern how people relate to each other and what they do in case of conflict.
You came to me and said in essence, what happens if two people have a conflict but they have not yet agreed on how to deal with any conflicts between them.
My answer is that the courts would use the standard of reasonableness and harm to determine what's just to resolve their dispute.
There's no contradiction here, it's the principle of harm and justice being either pre-set or determined after the fact. Obviously things are messier after the fact and thus people prefer to contract beforehand.


No one's ever going to agree you can do this and retain your moral position, agreement in place or not.


There would be no politicians at all in the system I propose, as there are no people to force laws on others or administer non-existent public-property. Similarly, there is 'crooked police and court system' since there are very many of these police and court services, and they trade on their reputation for fairness, and as such the most reliable gets the most business. 
Furthermore, when an actual dispute arises, either participant would have veto power on which court actually gets to try the case, ensuring that no one can force anyone to use a court-system they've potentially bought off.
If despite all that I managed to have you use a crooked court, if you could prove it after the fact you could sue me in another court, get the judgment overruled and also obtain damages from the court for wrongful conviction, which would also result in that court being put out of business permanently for it would've lost its reputation for fairness and independence.


In the system I propose, appeals would be handled by deciding up front how many trials will result in a sure verdict. Thus, if the case is very important, you might decide that 3, 5, 7, or 9 trials is worth it to get a sure verdict, and the plurality of rulings would decide the matter.
The problem with the supreme court is that they're not independent and have no duty to be fair at all. They regularly adjudicate cases involving the US government themselves, of which they are a part, which is a violation of the principle of judicial independence, whereby one must never try a case one has an interest in. Ie: Justices are paid by tax dollars yet regularly rule on tax issues.


The bigger risk in the current system is judge shopping--not possible under my system--and the politization of justice, also not an issue in my system, since justices are political appointees or otherwise elected.
I think you'd have a much better chance in a free market court which trades for its entire livelihood on its reputation for fairness and justice rather than in a modern government court which claims jurisdiction regardless of reputation for justice and can't be avoided even if it were proven to be bought off, and is full of political appointees with axes to grind rather than having to worry about a reputation for fairness to earn their next meal.

Not strictly true. There's more than one way to inflate or deflate, and ultimately they mean the same thing.
Either more currency can 'appear' resulting in inflation, or fewer people can demand the currency, the result is the same: a decreased price.
Or currency can be destroyed, disappear--deflation--or more people can begin demanding the currency resulting in an increased price.
Given static demand and static supply you'd have no change in price.
Right now we experience minor supply increase over time, alongside small drops in demand, and that's likely why the price is going down.
If bitcoin becomes a major currency, it will in fact be deflationary over time because of the ultimately limited amount available and the fact that humanity will always grow in population resulting in continual demand increases long-term.

Their means of switching back to hard assets was to hoard hold in case the fiat-dollar became repudiated.
This makes plenty of sense.
But if people instead switch to bitcoin, the gold-fallback strategy is effectively foiled.
Bitcoin may come to be seen as a better form of money than gold, in which case gold loses its premiere status as a currency-commodity.
And do you know what happens to the price of gold at that point? It begins to fall.
Because something like 90% of the price of gold is all value-store value. And if a better store of value comes about then competing stores of value must decline as confidence in the new thing increases.
Gold will lose its mystical status and value as a hard money asset as bitcoin climbs.

I may be fringe but I'm hardly crazy; rather I'm an anarcho-capitalist. 
Democracy has a great deal of unearned prestige. I don't blame you for either thinking it a wonderful thing nor thinking those against it must be wrong in the head, I remember when I too thought democracy was the pinnacle of political order. Our culture puts our democracy virtually on the level of holy writ.
But you know, I found out certain things about it that, from an ethical position, make democracy very suspect.
I suggest reading both "For a New Liberty", "Ethics of Liberty," by Rothbard and Hoppe's "Democracy the God that Failed."
Democracy isn't the end all be all of political structures and has some very serious structural flaws that are destabilizing societies around the world.
I simply think there's both a better way to organize a society that results in more freedom and fairness for everyone, and that it can be done without democracy.
But if you think ending democracy is radical, my solution would seem even more radical. The solution is to allow each person to control their legal circumstances, constituting a rejection of the idea that anyone has to force laws on anyone else.
This is a move towards political individualism, something that has never been tried before in history, and a continuation of the American Revolution, of which the American democracy was only a half-measure.
So, I urge you to reappraise your stance on democracy.

If it does so financed by taxation, then government is itself violating the very rights you say it is instituted to protect. If it is financed by the people they serve then there can just as easily be free market police and competing police forces. There's no need for any entity to have a monopoly on legal enforcement in a region.


I honestly thought this way once. But then someone pointed out to me that by claiming a territorial monopoly that government was in fact violating the rights of people to, for instance, create a competing organization. If police, courts, and law can all be provided by any group, or provided as a market service--which is true--then it is a violation of the rights of would-be competitors to use force to maintain a monopoly on those services within a region.


Then their customers will leave them. Competition ensures this will take place, since if they try to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers there will be another group willing to compete for their customers by not doing so. If anything, giving anyone a territorial monopoly allows them to charge the highest monopoly price while also giving the least among of service because they have a captive audience. You're actually arguing for the worst form of customer abuse that could possibly exist while positing a scenario that is less harmful than your preferred scenario.


You assume they'd even get to decide that. I don't assume that. I think such terms would be hammered out in courts by the participants prior to the trial. Go read Friedman's "Machinery of Freedom," also available free online on his site, for an explanation of how pre-trial negotiations would handle things like capital punishment.
I should mention that I've read just about everything Rand has ever written and was deeply into her. But she simply fails on anarchism and minarchism, and Rothbard was a major revelation to me. I still respect Rand but she simply falls short in this sphere.


It's more likely with the competing agencies, since competition drives them to actually please their customers, and customers want their rights defended. In the case of the government with the captive audience, unhappy customers have no recourse save something drastic like moving away, so it's far less likely their rights would be protected nearly as diligently as by the free market protection companies.


There's self-interest and the strong desire for rights protection! Heh. That's a far better guarantee than anything a government could give you.


I don't see how you can possibly assume that would happen automatically. We know that governments have perverse incentives not aligned with the people they rule. How do you imagine a government can be made to act rightly even though it faces no consequences for not doing so?
We know the protection company will act rightly because their livelihood depends on it--they could overnight lose every customer they have. This isn't true of the government, customers are captives. That seems a far less good guarantee for the government. DMV workers don't exactly worry about being fired for poor service...


Unless that's what people demand, and that is what they demand, of course.

Okay, I'm hearing 'goverment is the problem.'


Market monopolization always requires business collusion with government. Actual market monopolies cannot exist absent government collusion, so once again the problem is government, not capitalism.
As for Walmart, they had a dramatically reduced cost structure. Those other businesses couldn't compete and went away, that's a process of productive destruction which the economy requires.
That doesn't give Walmart a monopoly, only means everyone else has to step up their game.
To a certain extent too, Walmart's dominance is due to government intervention as well. Walmart and other large corps lobby for regulations that a large company is able to bear the cost of while small ones are heavily burdened, which has the effect of cementing large companies into their market position and defending them against competition from below.
If we removed government and thus the ability of corps to use law to cement their positions and defend against market competition, it's quite likely that we wouldn't see the kind of large monolithic mega-corps that dot the world today either.
So, once again, the problem is government, not capitalism.

Price = supply &amp; demand. 
With supply constrained, your millionaire trying to 'buy the whole market' means demand would be skyrocketing, which means price would skyrocket since supply cannot increase to fill demand increases (not minable supply anyway). Long before he could buy many bitcoins, his unquenchable demand for anything up for sale would drive the price into the lower three digits, thus mopping up all his money at a much higher price figure.
It would be like the market-cap of bitcoin had doubled, due to all his spending, but the number of coins remains the same, that's a simple calculation. We can figure that the price of bitcoin after he dumps his 3/4 billion on the market would rise to at least $142 per bitcoin, roughly doubling the price.
But actually, because he's frenzy buying the price might go far beyond that initially, to mop up his demand, maybe as high as $500+ or so because there could not be enough coins for him to buy. The market cap might double but he'd never get a chance to own half of all coins in existence! They simply aren't on offer, even at that price.
The old bitcoin dragons are still sleeping on their coin, at least 7 million btc have never been moved or sold.
A far more likely scenario is a millionaire dollar-cost averaging in over time so as not to spook the price and cause himself to experience drastic price increase. He'd setup a program to buy regularly at odd amounts and intervals so as to make it harder to spot him. Maybe he's buy frequently at very small amount, etc. Maybe he'd buy large blocks at punctuated times occasionally.

Completely false.
The dollar -is- our unit of account right now, on a functional basis. The ability of bitcoin to take over as a unit of account long term has virtually nothing to do with its deflationary aspect, and certainly doesn't harm that prospect!
I suppose she's implying the old fallacy that people don't want to spend a money that's deflating.


Naturally. Everyone who's studied Satoshi knows he recognized it was political from the beginning.
*Why do you think he went anonymous? DUH! Also, the first ever bitcoin transaction contains a hint of politics in it.*
Not only is bitcoin political, it's the best kind of political, a knife aimed at the heart of the elite's power-center in the world. Something they'd kill anyone to stop.
But if everyone chooses bitcoin over world currencies then there will be no stopping bitcoin.


The dev team downplays its political aspects--for obvious reasons.


Ridiculous. Removing its deflationary nature would harm bitcoin dramatically.

@_date: 2013-01-31 07:11:03
Sure, it's all [here](
The difficulty keeps rising such that a constant number of blocks are mined every two-weeks, however the number of coins awarded for finding a block halves every 200,000 blocks (20 weeks).  
Also, here's an expected [schedule of BTC mining discovery](
You can see that while it has only taken three years for half of all bitcoins to be mined, it will take the next 127 years for the very last Bitcoin to be mined!


Since mining bitcoins is done by processing the block chain, thus facilitating the verification of transactions for everyone, the process contains two way to make money:
- by discovering / mining new bitcoins
- by earning transaction fees for processing others' transfers
Current transaction fees are at minimum half a millibit: ฿0.0005 or higher. Senders of coins can set their transaction fee higher if desired.
Also you say what will 'back' bitcoin, I think you mean technologically? Bitcoin is backed by the work involved in creating new ones, it is backed therefore by cryptography, which allows you to create unique digital objects. Which is a fascinating thing in itself. This prevents inflation, prevents 3rd party control of the system, and is just about the best guarantee of value you can get outside of a physical object. 
Gold would be worthless if you could copy it as easily and cheaply as we copy digital goods. But cryptography prevents that entirely.
Also, during and after that 127 years, many coins will be lost outright, due to people losing their wallets, forgetting their encryption passcodes, etc., etc. There will occasionally be great fortunes lost that way. But the end result will be continued and steady deflation even then.
In fact, money of any kind doesn't have static value, but increases in value as demand for it increases. As long as the population of earth increases, the demand for bitcoin is likely to increase.
Take 21 million bitcoin and try to imagine if the entire world wanted to operate on bitcoin, 7 billion individuals! There's not nearly enough whole bitcoins to go around, not if each person wanted an entire bitcoin. That alone speaks of a deflationary future where the price of bitcoin continues to improve. But they can be essentially infinitely divisible.
If divided out equally, each person could have only ฿0.003, three millibits, assuming every coin had been mined and none lost. This figure, ฿0.003 would have to equal something like the yearly average wage of people on the planet for Bitcoin to be used as a global currency, three thousandths of a bitcoin might one-day be equal to at least $10,000 of today's dollars (the current average wage on the planet--obviously this figure as a mean is higher in most of the western world).
To put this in further perspective, the yearly income of the planet is about $70 trillion. If this were being paid out in bitcoin, today, then one dollar would equal three ten-millionths of a bitcoin, or thirty-microbitcoin: ฿0.0000003. 
 
Mindboggling numbers, and planetary GDP and population is only going to increase. Of course, it's a pain to read all those zeroes, but that would be easily adapted to in the future: A millibit can be expressed easily as a power. So we might write one millibit like this ฿^-3 1, called a 'millie.' A ten-millionth-bit is easily done the same way: ฿^-6 10, or ฿^-7 1 (with millionths being called 'microbitcoins' or 'mikeys,' so this: ฿^-6 10 would be ten mikeys) .
What we're going to see soon, with national currencies failing due to political control of them, due to inflation, is flight to stable forms of wealth transfer and wealth storage. And Bitcoin may be a place people flee to.
The first time a major economy flees to bitcoin, the price will skyrocket. It will still be perfectly usable as a currency for those who flee to it. But those who hold coins will see a huge price-gain relative to other currencies, as demand skyrockets. The game is young.
But before that can happen, the market-cap needs to rise to the point where it can comfortably facilitate large transactions, even on the order of billions, even hundreds of billions of dollars. Clearly we're nowhere near that. That's a deflationary signal as well.
What stands before us is a currency war, between the controlled currencies of the nation-states and the political tyrant-politicians who will lose a great deal of power and wealth if national currencies pass away in favor of uncontrolled and uncontrollable crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin.
The reason the powers that be hate bitcoin, the politicans,the bankers, is because they will lose a great deal of money. You see, there is a secret about inflation that the masses have never understood. It is that inflation is the greatest form of theft that has ever been conceived. When a nation inflates its currency, it steals value, invisibly, from everyone who holds that currency. So inflation robs you each year of, let's say, 3% or more, where does that value go? It goes into the hands of the nation that printed 3% more currency. They have stolen that value from you and everyone who holds currency.
And actually they've stolen far more than 3% because if they were not inflating, the economy would be naturally deflating as demand for it increases and people create value each year in the course of their work. American experienced deflation throughout the 19th century, and it fueled our growth to incredible extent.
The national currencies will be abandoned because for the first time, they can be. Governments can control physical goods, like gold, or other currencies, and prevent their people from entirely rejecting their national currency. But they never imagined a digital currency could ever exist. They may at some point try to take bitcoin on, to destroy it.
However, there's little to nothing they can do to stop its spread. They can only really ignore it. Tackling it head on and making it newsworthy would only prop it up still further and create another rush into it. And should they try to take it down, there exist countermeasures. I'd actually like to see someone try, because if that effort failed, as I expect it would, that would probably be the last time anyone would try. The bitcoin system would be bullet-proof from then on.

True, they probably aren't already tracking him, but chances are he's on a list of known crypto-experts already, possibly on a list on known libertarians too. And since he's likely outside the US and also a master of English language, that starts to become a pretty small list.
Then match that list with those who've ever used Tor ever (I haven't), and you start to get to a pretty small group of people.
His only defense at that point is plausible-deniability. Thus, his best option at this point is to never log into Satoshi Nakamoto-sock ever again if he wishes to maintain anonymity.
It must be difficult to carry such an amazing secret :) Plus he may feel he can't cash out either, for doing so would reveal his identity, since his addresses are among the earliest ones. Well, he'd need an anonymizer service--I suppose that would be enough.
It would be interesting if we suddenly started seeing movement in suspected Nakamoto addresses--the earliest ones :) But for now, we don't see that.
I would like to shake his hand someday, long after bitcoin has won the day and he can reveal himself safely :)

What is it about government that makes you think they're innately trustworthy?


Due to the court selection process it should be possible to choose a court that can't have any ulterior motives.


The court only gets its fee, it doesn't get to seize anything. And if the defendant felt wronged he could countersue in another court no different than now. Justice would prevail because most of us are reasonable.


The courts can't actually do anything, they're just mediating disputes. If a racist sued a black person and tried to use a racist court as you suggest, the black person should choose an impartial court. Again, no one can have any particular court forced on them, either party has veto power up-front.

Money is a medium of exchange. What's being exchanged is labor translated (ideally) into a universally acceptable value store that can then be exchanged for anything else.
Money is a technology. One that allows a much more rich and complex economy to exist, and most important of all allows extreme specialization to exist, which is hinted at by the end of the joke-piece :)

So far all my expectations have been rapidly exceeded. I don't expect that state of affairs to last however.
10 doublings in 5 years? That sounds drastic to my ears, honestly. Maybe spread over the entire world, yeah, I can see that, not in the US market alone tho. We might see 20% market penetration in the US market in 5 years I'd say, to be optimistic.
This would be an interesting investigation, to take all the major economic centers of the world and figure out what market penetration you need in all of them to hit $1 trillion market cap, and figure out what relative rates of adoption you're likely to see.
Take India, China, Japan, Korea, Europe, small amounts of Africa, much of the Middle East, South America to a decent extent, and North America.
I wouldn't be surprised if just a few percentage points of market penetration in all of these places quickly adds up to $1 trillion market cap! And that's a bit shocking.
For that matter, what kind of market penetration do we have right now in the US? 0.0001%? :P What percent of retailers that would like to implement Bitcoin transaction capability would do so if they only knew about it? 20% or more? Probably more, probably much more.
Gonna be an interesting next few years. I love the feeling of being 'in' on bitcoin right now, it's a sort of beneficent conspiracy of sorts :) A 'let's make the world a better place through spreading technology' kind of thing, which hasn't been replicated often in modern times, except for things like the spread of the steam engine, the telephone, electricity, and the invention of personal computers and cellphones.

I think it is not negligible, because miners have fixed-costs. They were running just above cost when the reward halved and thus weren't willing, or less willing, to sell at the same low-price. Only 3600 coins are left to fill the demand that previously was snapping up 7200 coins.

I can very easily see capitalists and communists segregating into their own communities and deciding the basis of their interactions thereby, since both camps accept different basic rights intrinsically.
It's also likely that people wouldn't want to craft their own laws--most people are not generators of laws. Most people will find a knowledgeable person they agree with and accept the same laws generated by this person and live in a community so endowed.
So, this is a case where you have a whole community that has individually accepted the same legal condition. It's the same outcome as if you had a 100% consensus decide on a law-set, but achieved via a very different means. 
It allows for very broad political experimentation, since no one is bound by the decisions of the group, thus will flower very many societies, without having to bow to the will of any arbitrary collective's majority vote.


Not necessarily. Instead, each person will run a computer program that contains their person law set, and in this hypothetical community, all of them have chosen the same law-set for themselves. This is the standard by which they have decided their individual property to be judged.
Since the boundaries of their property are contiguous it's quite similar as if one of today's cities had a law over everyone, but achieved via completely voluntary and individual means rather than by the ethically compromised aggressive mechanism of democracy.


They cannot conflict because they are decided by each property owner over only their own property. So all laws end at each person's property boundary. Visitors to anyone else's property must abide by the laws of the property owner or else not enter the property. Thus, visitors sign a usage agreement upon visiting. This can be carried over to future visits making it seamless for future visits.


They are ethical and historical norms, not necessarily unique to that region.


To enter the first road they will have to agree to the road owner's law-set for visitors, which will include abiding by a set of basic rights that the visitor must grant to others, including all the basic rights we'd normally expect. It would have too dispute resolution procedures and the like. Since this is a community of agreement, the visitor can expect much of the rest of the community to have the same-similar agreement.


Works just fine for them. They agree to abide by the usage law-set or they don't enter. Simple as that.
I don't doubt some places would have weird rules. Some places might require a dress-code for entry to their property. That's completely within their rights, as your presence on private property is at their leisure.


Not currently, but that's definitely how it would be in a free society such as I propose. Complete individual control of legal condition is required for escaping government. Laws have to be produced somehow, either collectively and by force or individually and by consent. I choose the latter idea and this is the mechanism for how it would work.


No one's forcing anyone. Either you agree to abide by X laws when visiting another's property, in which case you have given your consent, or you walk away, in which case no one has forced anything on you either.


Collective discussion is one thing, that's just information transmission. The real thing I'm focused on is where the locus of decision-making lies. If the locus of decision making lies in the collective via a collective decision making process such as voting, whether that vote is direct or representative doesn't matter--in either case the locus of decision-making does not rest with the individual.
When you seat the locus of decision-making with the individual you get a society that looks like the one I describe, where each person must use their reason to decide what law-set they want to live by, and where no one can force any law on them, and all laws are voluntary.
What happened to "power to the people" and the like? The system I propose gives the maximal amount of power to each person. It doesn't get more powerful than having 100% say over your own life and legal situation. Whereas, representative vs direct democracy both give you relative levels of a fraction of a percent of a decision over your own legal situation.
If there are millions of people voting, then your influence in any election is 1 / millions. Your vote means likely 0.00001% in any significant size election.
In my system, your vote means 100% in every legal decision.
And the funny thing is that both systems can produce the same outcome. Let's say 100% of the people want X law in a democracy they vote for it, they then get it.
Similarly, if 100% of people of an autarchy want X law and they add it to their person law-set then they get it.
But the situation changes when there's dissent.
In a democracy, say 51% want X law and 49% want Y law. 100% are forced to have X law and the 49% are terribly frustrated. Their interests have been sacrificed to the 51%, they have been forced to eat a law they don't want.
But under my autarchy this situation is rectified. For the 51% get X law and the 49% get Y law and everyone is again happy.

Individual secession, in a seasteading context. Walk outside their territorial jurisdictions and create a free society. They don't claim worldwide jurisdiction. The oceans are still free. We don't need to fight them, we can just walk away.


Sure. The way I see it, in a truly free society of libertarian character, each person would be responsible for setting the laws on themselves and their property, and for any visitors to their property. If they visited another's property, they would to agree to the law-set that owner provides to visit.
The result is *voluntary law*, crowd-sourced, replaces any law-making body with a monopoly on law-production.
Now, most people don't want to make law, clearly. It's a technical field, etc. So most people would adopt the most popular regional law codes. The result is that communities of legal agreement would spring up. Entire cities that agree on a particular set of legal ideals and agree to live by them, without being forced at all. Something akin to our blue-sky laws would arise undoubtedly.
So when a person when places in this society, they'd step off their property onto someone else's private road property, and would have a standing usage agreement with that owner, either free use or paid use (probably businesses would pay for local roads more than anyone else, with non-commercial use being free). The road owner sets the terms of use.
You go to your friend's house, he might have additional rules for use of his property, like taking your shoes off to save his white carpet or w/e.
So, it's a different system, but not altogether alien. It would be harder to implement, much like bitcoin is harder than a fiat money system, but it would ultimately result in true freedom, because the principle of unlimited individual secession means that anyone can take the law entirely into their hand at any time and start a new legal community on a new basis and no one can stop them.
It would encourage unlimited political experimentation within a voluntarist context.
Just as forced-law is replaced by individual-law, taxation would be replaced by voluntary subscriptions. You'd give your money to something you thought worthy of support, and you could withdraw that money at any moment.
Those new to the concept of a free society often ask "who would build the roads"? And we sometimes laugh, because roads exist because people want them to exist, and thus demand for roads can be filled via the market. You don't need government nor taxes to do it. And if government isn't doing it you're likely to get better quality at a much lower cost, since government always forces you to pay monopoly prices; government is a monopoly.
So, a typical sovereign individual in a free society would leave their home, drive on private roads to work, work a shift, and go home.
Someone proposes they build a bridge nearby, and thinking he would benefit from a bridge, our sovereign individual signs onto the project as a financial support, putting say a thousand dollars into the project voluntarily. He does this with bitcoin, using it's &gt;x function, which allows people to pledge money and that transaction only completes if the total amount pledged exceeds a certain value by a certain time.
As it turns out, the pledge goes through, they raise X millions, and now everyone who voluntarily put money into the project is now a shareholder in a corporation founded to complete this project. They are not a taxpayer. 
The bridge complete, the corporation now settles into managing the bridge long-term and administrating its use, and signing contracts with all the people who want to now use it. Thus, the bridge becomes profitable, and our sovereign individual actually receives a return on his investment (ideally) as a shareholder in the project.
No one was forced to pay for the bridge. Just as no one is forced to pay for multi-billion dollar chip fabs that the free market produces, nor for SpaceX's rocketship.
The key factor is individual secession. We have this political ideal that says that political legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed, and we interpret that to mean voting and majority rule. But actually it means much more than that. It means that when you withdraw consent from any authority over you, that authority loses its jurisdiction over you. And as for majority rule, that implies a socialist context, that only groups can consent or not consent--but that is not the reality. We are individuals before we are groups, and should be able to secede as individuals.

Yes, but that expectation only gets pushed so far into the future because of growing uncertainty, which is why a stock might sell at 20 times earnings when it could easily be around for 50 years or more.
So, the actual experience assuming things remain the same would be price growth over time.
All you're saying is that expectations are built into price, and I agree. However I think we'll see a bitcoin price in the thousands eventually. The price isn't thousands already because of how uncertain the market actors are as to how true that is and when it is likely to happen if it ever does.

Yeah, I'm starting to offload out of dollars too. US debts and obligations mean they'll push to inflate here as well, especially since QE has failed, they'll chase exports via inflation. If central banks the world over dump the dollar as reserve currency in retaliation, probably over a period of years, then the dollar may as well be flushed.

And it's not much better holding stocks and assets, as the inflation will drive phantom capital-gains which you'll be taxed on.

Not exactly. Scarcity is only one thing about gold that makes it a good money. Technically everything is scarce but not everything is a good money.
Gold is chemically neutral, that is to say that gold does not *rust*, thus as a value store it excels, you don't lose part of it by storing it like you would if you put your value store in, say, iron or wood.
Gold is easily identifiable from other metals and hard to fake, by virtue of its weight by volume and property of being quite soft comparatively. Thus with a few simple tests an exchanger can determine how much faith to put in a piece of gold.
We also tend to think of heavy things as more valuable inherently, which is why titanium never took off as a jewel metal and tungsten did, tungsten is both less expensive and far heavier by volume.
Similarly, bitcoin has certain inherent qualities that people value in money. This isn't to say it has inherent value, but rather that it has an inherent nature, controlled by its mathematical nature and that of the network in which it exists, its distributed nature, etc.
People value, for instance, low transaction costs. Bitcoin happens to enable the lowest possible transaction costs of all for long-distance (online) exchanges. Therefore people have found it valuable for such exchanges.
Were the number of bitcoin not strictly limited, it wouldn't be possible to use it for exchanges, because you couldn't use it as a unit of account with confidence, so it's limited supply is an important feature.
Same is true of gold, and this is what you meant essentially, that if we could make gold as easily as water there'd be no way to assign a true value to any individual piece. But that is only a pre-requisite for use and value as money, not the ultimate reason for it.

Depends how fast uptake of bitcoin as a currency becomes. If uptake continues to accelerate, people are still undervaluing it at current price. If uptake is slower than we expect, then you'll get over-exuberance and a small bubble to level out.
I think the recent month's price rise is due to several factors, but one of these is the exciting developments in bitcoin businesses and world-wide news of a global currency war. What a perfect time to have a currency war, to delegitimize the statist currencies of the world and offer a decentralized solution to exchange.
A lot of it depends on when the crash happens, if it happens. An early price crash is worse than a late one. Right now tons of people have bought, but if the price crashed down to, say $24, most people by far would be still in the black and happy to hold.
I know we've all been cringing, waiting for a price crash, for like the last month. Nothing. Now we're seeing buying out of fear this might be a sustained price increase, becoming almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. But because of the mining-reward halving, perhaps the supply is constrained enough to sustain current prices. Maybe the price will level off to sub $40 for the rest of the year and slowly begin creeping up again like it did after the 2011 crash until now.
We have a three year window until the next reward halving. Enjoy it while it lasts! I intend to mop up every last coin I can during this time.
One thing's certain, we're living through a historic moment, however it turns out :)

I agree also; Robert LeFevre suggested we can't truly call ourselves a civilized people until we reject the principle of aggression in all its forms, governmental included. We still tend to live by the idea of using force to deal with people rather than reason and voluntary structures, in barbaric fashion.

The blockchain was created to allow decentralization--which is why people trust bitcoin; no one can control the system, it is immune to politics, immune to the failure of any organization or person.
Centralization is what has kept previous e-cash schemes from taking off. Satoshi's genius was figuring out how to build a decentralized exchange that prevented double-spending reliably--that had never been done before. Centralized systems could do it easily, but decentralized ones had trouble with it.
Maybe bitcoin isn't trusted for an entire economy yet, but it one day could, unlike Amazon-coin or Facebook-coin.

True but such a person would be very risky to contract with at all, and thus may become an outcast. That's a much higher cost than simply going to court, thus most people will go to court.


See the above.


Since they are a free-market judge they can only earn future business if they have a reputation for fairness. It's unlikely that one bribe would rise to the level of compensating them for the loss of all future business if they were found out as a bribe taker. Plus taking a bribe means the bribee now knows they're crooked and how many times can they do that before that becomes common knowledge and their business drops off entirely.
Beyond that there's opportunity for multiple appeals to other independent judges, what are the chances they'll be able to bribe all the judges? Low.


If the injured party sues for false judgment and can prove it, then they can obtain a judgment against the false court too! Something you can't do in a state-sponsored court society.


I suggest only that there'd be far less of it, because now a judge's reputation for fairness is immaterial--they receive court cases shunted to them by the government, and their income is guaranteed. Judges known to be crooked, or lean one way or the other, must lose an election or be caught red-handed.
In a free market scenario, such judges wouldn't become judges by winning elections at all, but by garnering a reputation for impartiality and upstandingness in the first place in order for someone to trust them with a case.
And at the first hint of graft or bribery, they'll lose all their clients and be out of business.


I believe in incentives, if not humanity being always rational. Currently judges don't have a ton of incentive not to be corrupt. In a free market society, they have massive incentive because their livelihood depends on it.

In the recent FBI or CIA review of Bitcoin, they decided that they could still control and peek at point of sale and purchases of bitcoin, and thus aren't worried for now. Ie: if they can still make you or your bank disclose purchases of bitcoin and sales into dollars, then they've still got their eye on you.
The real off-the grid types will only buy bitcoin via over-the-counter or in-person transactions which won't leave a record right to them.

So what's next after ASICs?
Will they simply keep jacking up the number of ASICs on a chip to scale GH/s and improving power efficiency?
Might we one day see ASIC chips incorporate into cellphones, working the blockchain natively?
Suppose central bankers decide Bitcoin is a threat and invest millions to doing a 51% attack, are ASICs our best means of counterattack?
I know if a 51% attack were in progress, I'd hook up my own GPU to add processing power to the network, even without the monetary upside, since a successful 51% attack could cause the loss of my existing value in BTC.
I suppose buyers could also boost network capacity in the case of a 51% attack by jacking up transaction fees, thus incentivizing mining to add power to the network.

Naturally. 


Do you know anyone who bets their grocery money? I don't.
People only invest when they produce more value than what it costs them to live. You present a false choice between starving and investing.


They happen in both situations, but the businessman at least has the virtue that if he makes a mistake, it's his ass. If the government worker makes a mistake, he does not suffer personally. He's risking the publics' money, not the organization's.
The incentives on a private business that must earn a living sets up virtuous incentives compared to a government organization.
Which is why private businesses tend towards being far more efficient and effective than gov orgs. And that will never change. A gov org doesn't need to make a profit to continue to exist, and their existence is virtually guaranteed--they can't suddenly go out of business--thus they are wasteful, corrupt--indeed more corrupt than business, and unresponsive to public needs. Gov orgs also face no competition, there's no worry of customers going to another competitor and driving you out of business.

When a DDOS doesn't tank the market, you can always sell a ton of coins trying to spark a sell-off.
I think it's just the evolving tactic of the market manipulators. However, this tactic is far riskier than DDOS and if and when it fails--and it will fail, for each successful attempt results in wising the market up--then they'll stop this too.
Just enjoy the cheap coins and buy them up. If they fail to spark a sell-off beyond their own activity, they fail to make any profit.

I don't think you understand what causes inflation.
Inflation is -always- caused by an increase in the money supply. Thus bitcoin is an excellent curative to inflation, as it cannot be inflated.
I think the confusion stems from the fact that economists typically measure inflation rates by looking at prices, and prices can increase or decrease due to factors outside inflation, ie: demand variances. 
But inflation itself is always tied to the money-supply.

I support a legal theory called autarchy which means "rule of the self by the self."
You're right that if you have someone forcing laws on others then you have a government. That's why I advocate rejection of the principle that anyone should be able to force laws on anyone.
I think each person should choose their own lawset, and when two people interact, such as visiting another's property, they should agree beforehand upon the laws that will govern their interaction.
Police and courts will then uphold the laws agreed upon between people, much as courts uphold contracts now.
In fact it wouldn't even be a particularly radical change, as everyone already understand law and law enforcement, only the mode by which laws would be created and applied would change.
This would create a system of poly-centric voluntary law.
So you see, there would be no government either.

Bitcoin's lower transaction costs is in fact one of its absolute most compelling value propositions! I wouldn't discount it so easily. You seem to say it's entirely a non-factor, which cannot possibly be true given the massive cost differences of competing services.


That's only going to be more important than cost in limited circumstances. Someone in most western countries can already send money to others with mostly no questions asked, and cost may be more important to them.


True enough, in the sense that switching into and out of btc has costs. But those are still marginal compared to, for instance, Western Union's 10% fee, compared to a roughly 1% fee for going into bitcoin and then another 1% back out. 
As btc becomes more ubiquitous that cost begins to disappear as people simply remain in btc entirely and that becomes easy.
What a person values will really determine what they find most attractive about bitcoin. For the who told his Kenyan friend about bitcoin, he said she was virtually in tears and the reason was because she could send money to Kenya and avoid WU's 10% fee, it wasn't about access for her.

Value is subjective, price isn't, price exists at the confluence of valuations known as a transaction between two or more people. 
That said here are some reasons why I think it has value. Bitcoin is the best money for a few existing scenarios: when you want to send money overseas, or when you want to pay for something online.
Of these two, the latter is huge. It's the best because it's much cheaper, easier, and less iffy than existing Visa/Mastercard/Paypal solutions. Who hasn't heard of 3%-4% CC fees, POS rental fees, chargebacks, fraud-charges, PayPal fraud, etc., etc., etc. The list is endless.
Bitcoin solves all that, forever.
Are online purchases going to increase or decrease? Obviously increase. And if so, will people gravitate towards the best currency for making online purchases? Of course.
Bitcoin's future then is huge, potentially encompassing that of the entire economy.


Let them, there's only so many big players. It will reduce volatility further by distributing large holdings into lots of little holders. And we don't yet have a lot of institutional currency traders working in bitcoin, but when they do, attempts to manipulate the market for profit create profit opportunities for currency arbitrators, resulting in less overall price instability.
Trust the free market, it's one of the basic principles behind bitcoin :)

However if they do they, they will tip off the world that you can really piss off the US by using Bitcoin!
Suddenly the Middle East realizes they can stick their thumb in the US's eye by pricing oil in bitcoin rather than the dollar.
They've been itching to get off pricing oil in dollars for a looooong time, but the Euro is in shambles and they don't trust the Chinese.
So they price in bitcoin, forcing the US to instantly relent and allow US companies to buy bitcoin.
Suddenly bitcoin is mainstream, all because the US took a point of opposition against it. In one fell swoop the price of bitcoin rises to $10,000 / coin to accomodate oil trading. And the dollar crashes just as hard.

It would be law on your property, sure. But no one would visit you for they'd be risking death, and if anyone killed you while on your property they could not be prosecuted, since your law was that it's okay to kill, you accepted that.
Somehow I doubt most would want to live under that scenario.

In that circumstance, if I remember correctly, the Argentine regime pegged to the dollar but also kept printing pesos! Of course the peg would soon break, that's two contradictory policies!


Indeed, but that then deprives the government of a great way to siphon wealth from the rest of the country via inflation, which is why countries don't like to do that and like to run their own currencies.
Which is also why bitcoin has a chance to be the people's currency, an un-manipulable one. Ecuador's use of the dollar still has the great risk that the US politicians will eventually destroy the dollar too, as is guaranteed to happen in the long-term barring outside catastrophe.

o_O A shopkeeper would only be able to use force enough to stop the theft, any going beyond that would be an initiation of aggression and be utterly unethical and he'd face trial himself.
You people labor under some strange superstitions about anarchism. Go read "For a New Liberty" or Rothbard's "Ethics of Liberty" for that matter.


Thing is, by entering the shopkeeper's property he will have explicitly agreed ahead of time to the mutual idea that theft is unethical. So the thief has already agreed not to steal in a libertarian society. Yes, the thief would be presented with an actual agreement upon first entering and would sign to the effect that theft will be prosecuted.
So again, you are just imagining a strawman scenario.

Possibly, but I can't imagine what they could do about it. Would they just decide to live with lower profit margins somehow? The typical move would be to lobby congress for protection from the usurper, but they'd likely lose that fight long-term.
I think the least likely scenario is them actually trying to adapt bitcoin into their business model, because the profit simply isn't there to be had.
Bitcoin is a Sword of Damocles hanging over their business model and they'll go down squealing like pigs.
At best they could copy Bitpay and start hedging, but it's likely that the bitcoin community would denigrate them as part of the old guard, regarding them with suspicion and loathing.

I know a guy who borrowed some 45k then leveraged that for another 45k, day traded, lost it all, and was so distraught as to commit suicide.
Extreme example, granted.
As for this gentleman, when you borrow on credit you've got to at least beat the interest costs. So he's got say 1 year at 0% interest then it bumps to 10%+ w/e. So he's got to now sell within that period.
If he doesn't make a considerable profit in that time, he could be in trouble. Suppose he doesn't time the market well and it crashes down to ~$11. It took years to recover last time.
I wish him well, but personally I won't be borrowing to buy bitcoin, it's a house of cards that might just come down on your head. I'd rather own my coin free and clear.

I think it has much more to do with the structure of education as a government monopoly service.
The incentives on a government-school teacher are nothing like what a free-market teacher would face. 
There are no consequences for poor performance as a teacher, and there is no merit or way to advance yourself by being a good teacher. So most are barely adequate teachers at beast. Once they have tenure they cannot be fired, etc.
If we really cared about school children learning we wouldn't make firing teachers impossible. We'd incentivize actually good teaching.
We don't do this because the teacher's union has allied itself with one of the political parties and effectively blocks any attempt at even the slight reform, lest the smallest crack become a landslide.

@_date: 2013-09-07 04:23:10
Yes it is unethical. 
Theft is not always wrong, but in that case it is. Some would argue that the notion of private property is primarily a means of avoiding conflict, and I'd agree. And that there are situations, edge cases, where that rule should be broken, especially in cases where an irreparable loss will happen if the property violation doesn't occur.
Such as this ethical quandry: suppose 100 lives are will be ended unless I can steal my neighbor's rifle to prevent this. After using it I intend to put it back without any damage and there's no possibility of obtaining the owner's permission ahead of time. Should I steal the rifle?
Few would have a problem with a property violation that is fixable to prevent a loss that would be irreparable.
But here's the key: it would be up to the owner of the rifle after the fact to decide if he wants to press charges. And more than likely they wouldn't, naturally.
Same with stealing for starving. The stealer should be willing to accept legal sanction after the fact if the food's owner doesn't take pity on them and not press charges.
The real question is why are they starving. When it's due to no fault of their own it's hard to blame people for desperate actions to stay alive.
Fortunately, in societies where the initiation of force is rare (ie: societies where rights are respected), no one starves to death (ie: capitalist countries).
It is the countries where rights violations are paramount and overarching (eg: North Korea) that are starving to death today.

I wasn't trying to imply timeline by the order I mentioned him, lol.


Largely the same animal with a Marxist pivot in tactics, actually. Rightist anarchism, ie libertarianism, is the only new beast in town, and it stems from the earliest anarch tradition before anarchs came to believe private ownership of property was the root flaw.


o_O I call myself ancap, so... I was speaking against 19th century leftist anarchs, who were a bunch of murdering bastards, and their leftist anarch brethren today whom justify aggression in the name of equality.


This is the ideology I profess currently.


They had less fine grained concepts of property, but to imagine they didn't have property in fact is a bit silly. They defended hunting grounds from other tribes, because those grounds could only support so many people. This is a recognition that private property must be maintained in order to live, even if their concept of it was tied to group survival over individual survival. For them the social group was the unit. They were stuck in tribal communism. 
My point was that today we have a much, much more advanced economy precisely because we have fine-grained ideas of private property, and that our level of population requires private ownership in order to be maintained. If you abandoned private property we'd go back to a much less productive level of society, like tribal communism where they usually starved most of the year, and millions of people would have to die due to the much lower level of productivity of such a society. So it's not merely an 'interesting set of beliefs' it's a fact that our society requires the order that produced its current population level, because there is no other more productive order than capitalism, communism certainly isn't more economically prosperous, and if you want to leave capitalism the result is death.


Individuals who trade for it or mine it.


Funny how both sides of the spectrum seem to like bitcoin. I'd call it perfect capitalism. It was created to avoid the state, and in today's world the state is the agent of socialism. It was libertarian ideas and ideals and actors whom created bitcoin, Satoshi's writing have strong libertarian leanings. That some leftists anarchs and socialists also think this is a good thing is largely an accident, because most of them run about saying we need to abolish money, not improve it :P

True, and even the people who believed that I don't think take it seriously anymore.


No, I said decentralization was a libertarian argument, not that you need to understand libertarianism to understand decentralization. What I mean is, if you understand decentralization you, in one sense at least, understand libertarianism generally. So it's actually completely the other way around from what you said here.


Sure it can, but oddly enough the reverse isn't true--socialists don't tolerate capitalists within their midst while capitalists tolerate others just fine. Funny how that works.
But just because it can work in other systems doesn't mean this is abuse of power. The links to libertarianism are in there because bitcoin and libertarianism are intimately entwined. As I said, bitcoin is a product of libertarians and libertarian ideas and ideals. 


'Make it right'? You must be joking. As if it were somehow wrong or unethical to make it plain for all to see that bitcoin is a product of libertarianism.

I've spent 20 years trying to figure out how to 'get money out of politics.' Not a single scheme isn't able to be routed-around and many such schemes violate the rights of people and thus shouldn't be used at all completely aside from their ineffectiveness (ie: public financing).


You haven't learned yet that monopolies are -only- possible when granted by government. In a free market you wouldn't have monopolies at all. They have always been a product of collusion with regulators. Go do your homework. The gov attitude against monopoly is only good press while the history of monopoly shows gov-granted monopolies all over the place. Even the average person today will agree that some monopolies are so-called 'natural monopolies' like power companies and water. The gov gave AT&amp;T a monopoly on phone service at one point for decades.

Yes, but it already halves the kinds of possible scams, and it's far preferable, because a business is a going concern and other there in the public.
A new venture would be strongly questioned. And if you've ever spent some time on the cutting edge of ASIC production companies on Bitcointalk.org, you've seen the lengths potential buyers will go to to vett these companies, dox the scammers, and spare their dosh from scams.
If a well established business scams you, it's not like they are going to simply disappear into the mists. That's a vast improvement over being customer scammed, and means also that businesses who intend to be legitimate from the beginning will not have to face any scamming worries at all!
And that is a massive improvement!
I've heard of a lot of new and small companies literally being put out of business by an ill-timed scam depriving them of operating capital. Businesses that operated on thin margins, single-person efforts and the like.
Also, prices should go down, as biz's won't need to artificially raise prices to cover the cost of both dealing with scammers and cover the cost of actually getting scammed as a kind of insurance.

It may be that the arrival of ASICs means far less existential risk of a 51% attack for instance. We have ASIC companies talking about providing peta-hash ranges now, meaning confidence in the network has improved considerably.
Bitcoin is already the largest distributed computer on the planet, bar none. So, that rise in confidence could correspond with a tipping point of public opinion. I myself have known about bitcoin through all of 2012, but only made a purchase in late December. I might be representative of a lot of people. Sometimes things happen in waves.

Where did you pay *from*, because chances are the problem was from the online wallet you used. Like if you paid out of a Coinbase account, that can take a long time.

You can't spend directly from a paper wallet, you must import the key into a client first. So the change would go back to w/e the client's rules are, likely one of the pre-made addresses in the client. 
You'd then send the amount from your client back to your original address to complete the loop and restore the change to your paper wallet.
Some people have lost money by importing a paper-wallet key, spending from it partially, then assuming the change was still in their paper wallet, when in fact the client had routed it to a new change address. Then they deleted their client wallet thinking the balance was still on their paper wallet, and now it's gone entirely (unless you use a deterministic-key client which can recover future keys).

It would be ridiculous to claim they're "creating currency" as if they had a printing press in back, but they are literally creating money out of thin air.


That's quite similar to what I said.


This I think is where you make a mistake. A 100% reserve bank--maybe I'm using the wrong terminology--because such a bank doesn't have reserves. It's simply refusing to inflate its money supply.

This can be solved contractually, indexing the principal and repayment to inflation/deflation. It's actually not a problem. Inflation is politically popular because most people are debtors and want their loans to get cheaper over time, and most people have the most votes and loan-holders are cast as the evil rich exploiters that no one cares about and they have far fewer votes.
In an individualist political economy which doesn't accept the mechanism of democracy to decide political issues, substituting instead agreement-based law, neither party of a loan would be favored or disfavored that way.

This is what the opponents of anarchists fear and assume, but this is not at all what I at least think.
Yes there's no such thing as complete freedom, but taking away someone else's freedom is an aggression.
Rather, freedom exists in a property context. You have complete freedom within the sphere of that which you own: yourself and your property, and nothing else.
If someone stops me from doing what I want with my property while I am not harming anyone else's property, that is an invasion of my freedom, an aggression against me, and unethical.
In an anarcho-capitalist society there would still be police, there would still be courts, there would still consequently be rights protection--it's continually mystifying to me that people imagine there wouldn't be, or that anarchs would want a place without those things.
Only we imagine the free market providing security services and court services, making taxation and government unnecessary, among other things.
Most people imagine we need government because they know we need police and courts, but those two things are eminently divorcible.

Wow, so he 'named' the send-to address with Friedcat's address, then the 2nd address is where the actual send-to address goes. I can see how this would confuse him utterly.
The parsing on that field is "alias - address." Again, he put Friedcat's address as the alias and put his own blockchain address as the place it referred to.
So of course it went back to his address, yet it's a bit confusing because he'd named it there as Friedcat's.

You seem to keep ignoring why I mentioned that we could make oil in a lab at all. I said only that it was renewable, that even if we mined all the world's oil we haven't run out of oil since we can create it in a lab. That is to say that after the world has switched entirely to electric, we still have a need for oil for things like lubrication and the like, and we'll always be able to produce it if need be, because we can make it in a lab. I was not trying to suggest we could replace the world's oil consumption with lab-produced oil. That's why I mentioned bio-diesel and solar in that context.
I'm a mod of I should think I know something about these issues.


We don't need mass transportation. Let the market decide what tech and what fuel will take over. As the price of oil rises to account for its rarity, the market will produce energy alternatives naturally.


From what, peak oil, or are you worried about global warming.

If he transferred immediately from your paper wallet, then performing a successful double spend would be very, very difficult. For one thing, it'd have to be perfectly timed to when you key in your transaction, which he has little control over. Secondly he'd need the complicity of a miner, and for small transactions it wouldn't be worth it. 
So really he'd need to wait for one, maybe two confirmations tops. Ten minutes.
Beyond that, a double spend attempt should be almost immediately detectable, because it's being broadcast to the network.
I'm pretty sure I remember Bitpay saying they look for double-spend attempts at the time of the transaction.
Maybe he doesn't need the complicit miner if the fee is higher on the 2nd transaction, kinda fuzzy on that detail.

Individuals are the discreet entity of society. To claim otherwise is ridiculous. It doesn't matter if a person has conflicting desires and complex psychology, they are one physical unit, indivisible, an individual. You have to seriously twist the facts in your own mind to come to any other conclusion.


Sure, in developmental periods. So then your thesis would stand purely for non-adults. Any adult is capable of living for years at a time, alone, on an island, without human contact of any kind. Not only is this self-evident, it has been performed multiple times.
Humankind prefers social contact for various reasons, but it is not a requirement of our physiology nor psychology.
The elemental unit of society is the individual.

It is, actually. It's a net improvement in the situation both sides faced.
This is because it switches the normal situation.
Right now companies are very easy to scam by unscrupulous customers, using various cash, refund, and bank transfer scams and the like. Many have been scammed to the point of bankruptcy, including several bitcoin-related small businesses that foolishly accepted Paypal and got scammed.
This is because it's quite easy for a customer to fake who they are and disappear with the business's value.
But companies are out there, in the public eye, they're not likely to escape and disappear. If a business wants to scam a customer it can only do it once before word gets around. And if they plan to keep operating they will get a very bad reputation and eventually be driven from business.
Kinda like BFL. They may not have intended to scam people but their failure to deliver has been the equivalent of it.
And here we are, people pursuing paths to get their funds back from BFL, because BFL cannot disappear into the ether like a random customer can with fake credentials.

Al Capone actually had people murdered.
As for DPR, *no one died*.


No, a random drug dealer, in his capacity as a person standing up against the state's unethical laws against drugs, is to that extent a hero as well. And that's why I laud DPR for the same thing. Has nothing to do with him personally, he's as much a hero as anyone who stands up to unethical laws, right up there with MLK, whose line applies here: "An unjust law is no law at all." And laws against drugs are unjust laws, and we need more DPRs, not fewer.


Exactly. Everyone who would sell drugs is a hero.


In terms of [anarcho-capitalist](ethics, you'd be correct--at least for the prosecutor, not for the witnesses. The prosecutors are engaging in aggression against those they convict of drug dealing, and can be ethically resisted.
However, we do not do so because it would be counter-productive to our own lives--we'd surely be imprisoned or killed. DPR is a hero because he was willing to take that chance with his life.
This isn't to say that resisting state aggression is unethical, only that the US still contains overwhelming forces that believe the opposite and that reality cannot be ignored.
But yes, a police-officer raiding a drug dealer's house is, in an objective sense, doing something unethical and can be ethically resisted. You'll still go to jail for it because the larger society doesn't agree. 


Prosecutor, yes. Witness? No.


No. This is the argument of people who support drug laws--not libertarians like me. We argue precisely the opposite, that the end does not justify the means. That the end of making society better or more moral or w/e does not justify stopping a transaction between consenting adults where no one is harmed. We take a moral stance on this question--not a utilitarian (immoral) stance.


You're wrong about that. You are not free today to sell a simple drug to someone. That is objectively a freedom you lack--despite that activity being perfectly ethical. No perception involved.


[Democracy is inherently unethical.](&gt; where rules are what the majority agrees upon.
That is unethical. Government has power only by the consent of the governed. The majority forcing its will on the minority when the majority has withdrawn consent is unethical.


It's not disagreement, it is calling out their actions what they are: inherently and objectively unethical. Drug laws are fake laws, for no one is harmed when a person sells or uses drug.
**No victim, no crime.**
That will never change and can never be changed.


No, that is not how it should work and I will never agree that I should have to leave my property because other's are forcing their will on me. My property, my rules. Everyone else can fuck off.

You should look at how much money they actually printed, not merely the inflation rate. Inflation is purely a monetary phenomena. The gov, through the fed, has inflated the money supply significantly last few years, yet this hasn't impacted prices because most of it has been locked away as bank reserves and the like. That doesn't mean they didn't inflate by more than 3%, just because you're measuring inflation by price increases across a broad economy.
I can't find the article I'd read, but it showed actual money printed by the gov and then spent bailing out banks and the like, including things like the $700 billion stimulus, exceeding the amount taken in by taxes in the 2-3 years after the '08 crash.

2 GH? 
Try 300 megahashes/sec.
2 bitcoin per USB miner iirc, doing 300 MH/sec. Way too much. 
Check the [mining calculator]( here.
This thing wouldn't break even for 213+ days even if the difficulty never increased. Even if you had one today its daily net profit is ~$1 a day.
The only people who should buy one of these are those wanting to sell to dupes or something.
**ASICMiner is in the position of needing the difficulty to increase as rapidly as possible so it can cement its market-share and increase the cost of matching its hashrate. But it can't do this alone due to the 51% problem.**
To do this it's selling hashing devices at near par value, trying to suck as much profit out of them as possible for its shareholders, effectively increasing the network hashrate while sucking near all the value out of the device itself.
I don't blame them for this, but I'm not about to buy a USB Eruptor any time soon.

You can do that by importing the same wallet-keys to those devices as a spending wallet. You could have a hundred devices all with the same keys inside, all spendable from that address.

So let's say it would cost $1 million to do a 51% attack on bitcoin.
At the same time, the market cap for Bitcoin is $200m, so $1m can threaten $200m, and that's $200m worth of interest in defeating a $1m attack on the part of those who own bitcoin. Meanwhile even a successful 51% attack won't be profitable to the attacker. Unless he plans to only scare people and buy bitcoin from people afraid it might work only to let it live in the end.
Therefore an attacker would have to spend about $200m to take down Bitcoin.
But the result would only be the establishment of a new Bitcoin successor, this time hardened against a 51% attack.
Bitcoin is a hydra. The genie is out of the bottle.
Also, if someone did build ASICs to attack bitcoin, wouldn't it be possible for all friendly miners to agree to change the standard in some significant way, rendering all previous ASICs unable to mine anymore. It would cost both sides all their ASICs, but it would work, as long as the 51% attack didn't immediately surpass the 51% threshhold.

I don't like how the bottom options are bolded compared to the links, which you have as black/gray (colors would be better too). That makes these bottom options the most prominent thing on the page, and they get repeated every time. I want to quick-glance and see prominently the most important info: the link text. This is why the typical style uses both a bold on link text and a slightly larger font, and grays out those bottom comments which are always there and usually not needed. You those bottom line words smaller, but bolded, they really pop compared to the usual style. I'd say flip it, bold the link text, pick some appropriate colors for these texts too, and unbold the bottom words.

Yes. That's capitalism, it is the natural state of humanity. That's why it works. It is only far more advanced today than when the ancients were trading in markets. But the principle is the same, voluntary trade.


Yes, capitalism does require both rights protection and dispute resolution. Any society does. But the question is whether only state can provide those services. Libertarians contend that states need not be the one providing those services.
Any service that exists can be and has been purchased on the open market. We buy private security at the same time we're taxed for government police services. But the former could do the latter's job.
And we use private binding arbitration services at the same time that we're taxed to support government courts. But the former can, again, do the latter's job, both better and cheaper, for it does so under market constraints rather than political constraints, and does so without a monopoly position or price, such as the government police and courts maintain.

Since you're talking about identifiers I assume you're talking about a Blockchain.info wallet. How exactly did you get his identifier?
I'm afraid the solution is to do your due diligence up-front and avoid being scammed in the first place, not to encourage cracking, not that it's really gonna happen anyway.
Alternately, if you have his personal info, call the police and pursue law enforcement channels against him. Did his info turn out to be fake? There are ways to make sure that doesn't happen, like requiring pictures that can't be shopped or faked with the date and relevant info written on a piece of paper, etc.

- Open client (can do this while it syncs)
- Click the "receive coins" tab
- hit "new address" button at the bottom
- It prompts you for a label on this address. Put in the customer's name or whomever you expect to send you bitcoin to this address. You can make unlimited addresses for each sender. Helps you keep track of who sent you what.
- Once you hit 'ok' you will see the new address pop up in the list with the label/name you gave it, and to the right of it a bitcoin public address. 
- Right click on the address that corresponds to the name, select "copy address"
- Give this address to the person / service who needs to send you bitcoin. (that way you can minimize transcription errors and the like)
If you're unsure, send yourself a small amount first in order to get used to how it all works and test the system. It's really cool to see the little notification pop up in your bar that says you just received X bitcoin :)
(Eg: if you bought on Coinbase, send maybe 0.1 bitcoin to your client to test it out. But first make sure your Client-wallet is encrypted with a very good password and that you have backups. Do research on good passwords and how to create and store them. Be sure, as there's almost no way to recover a lost encryption password. If you're not sure your computer is safe, it's better to use Blockchain.info with 2-factor identification.
Also, for more help on storing your bitcoin, checkout :) good luck. )
@_date: 2013-02-05 00:30:41
That's a pretty good suggestion. But it would change their business model pretty significantly I think.
@_date: 2013-08-02 07:44:35
Your fears are largely unfounded.
Yes, in the scenario you craft there is potentially a problem. But let's suppose it actually happened today, 66% of the network drops off.
That's a profit opportunity.
Everyone with an old GPU farm that was turned off and no longer profitable realizes they can now turn it back on.
Everyone with an unprofitable USB Eruptor takes it off alt-coins and back onto bitcoin.
CPU mining might actually become profitable again.
Over time we have successive generations of ASICs being turned off because they're not efficient enough, just as GPU farms are being turned off now.
Those could very easily come back online.
The mistake is thinking that the amount of hashing power on the network is a fixed and unflexible commodity.
Besides, you don't actually need confirmations to perform sales. You have instant transaction propagation through nodes, and once this is detected, and no double-spend attempt detected, the transaction is at that point irreversible and would be rather difficult to change, since nodes will reject later time-stamped double-spend attempts.
The only people that absolutely need a block confirmation are those dealing with large value items and who simply want the security of inclusion in a block.
One hour confirmations? No biggie.
But even if all of that was wrong and a problem so incredibly large that it was impossible to work around, we still have Jeff Garzik, and Gavin the magic man and the the whole team of programmers whom could, in an emergency like this, put out a new version of the software to change the difficulty right away if needed.
But the fact is, I doubt we'll ever see the situation you describe occur. Bitcoin may be volatile, but it's not -that- volatile. It's not $500 today and $2 tomorrow, and like that is the only scenario I can imagine where what you suggest would legitimately happen.
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:06:30
Nodes always accept the first spend attempt they see as legitimate. I misspoke saying 'time stamped,' it's just a matter of when they see it.
Thus a double-spend attempt must happen at virtually the same moment a legitimate spend-attempt happens, or else the legitimate one will win the race of broadcast-propagation.
If the majority of nodes see the first spend attempt first, they will each reject the double-spend attempt because they've already 'seen' a spend of those coins.
This is how the protocol works. And why Bitpay for instance simply spends a few seconds looking for double-spend attempts after you send it a transaction and, seeing none, confirms the transaction.
Because there's a very small window in time for a double-spend attempt to get off until transaction propagation makes it no longer possible.
Which is why we don't necessarily have to wait for a block to be made before completing a transaction. Only if you want to be incredibly sure it's irreversible via inclusion in a block, say for high value transactions, do you necessarily have to wait for that.
I'm not gonna go reference you the documentation on that, sorry, but that is a complete write-up of my understanding of the protocol.
If you want validation I suggest either researching it or just buying something off Bitpay :P If it didn't work as I suggest here, Bitpay would force you to wait for a block to complete before finishing a transaction. But I'd done multiple-thousand dollar transactions with them that completed in seconds, before this is how the bitcoin protocol works. And when you submit to Bitpay it actually says "looking for doublespends" for a few seconds after you send the transaction and it has seen it broadcast, and seeing none it will confirm and close your transaction almost instantly, in about the same time it takes a credit card purchase to be validated at a POS in a store.

No, because coins will always be static, whereas mining may give you more coins.
You can either hold let's say 70 bitcoins and let the price go up. Or you can buy a miner for 70 bitcoins and end up with 150 bitcoins, or possibly less than 70 in the worst case (like if you buy a AM Eruptor USB :P).
If you aren't willing to take the risk, hold the coin. Otherwise an ASIC can be a good deal.

Well there's really two major risks I think.
1. Hyper-inflation probably couldn't come unless there was a currency to *run to*.
Note the Argentinian inflation, the populace was and is running to a more stable currency: the dollar.
Suppose the dollar began to hyperinflate, where would people run to exactly? Hyperinflation is just about impossible without a currency to escape to. People won't be escaping to gold.
And I don't think the gov will simply print enough bills for hyperinflation to just happen like some 3rd world country, though perhaps that's possible. 
But let me return to this in a second...
2. Existential risk: being the reserve currency carries its own unique risk, that being that reserve banks around the world may one day decide to dump you.
Now, I have no idea what sort of crisis could precipitate world banks dumping the dollar, but the ability to move to a better currency than the dollar makes this risk more real, and bitcoin could be that currency. The event would have to be extreme and sudden.
It'll be an interesting day if and when we one day see central banks taking a position in bitcoin as a hedge against dollar inflation. That would be the beginning of the end for the dollar.
Perhaps the Chinese would be the first to do this. They'd love to embarrass the US in that fashion and tarnish the prestige of the dollar. I suppose the only thing that might keep them from doing it is that they'd like to replace the dollar with the yuan as world reserve currency and moving into bitcoin would make that less likely.
We shall see; we'll see it in our lifetimes.

Again, no one died.
He used the threat of violence--and that is an aggression, I agree, unless it was in defense against threatened violence too, then it's defense. So which is it? 
He used the threat of violence to counter his blackmailer's threat of violence, the violence of the nation state if it had the names and addresses of people using his site, whom would then face arrest and worse.
So it's not as clear cut as some would like you to believe. I can't say what he did was entirely ethical, but it's not as clear cut as some are saying.
Yes it's all dramatic to say he "ordered a hit," but no one died. So either he's really bad at ordering hitmen, or he knew exactly what he was doing, using the threat of force, in the face of the same threat from the blackmailer, against the blackmailer himself.

When you spend from an address / wallet, the entire contents of the address are sent to the recipient and the rest then sent back to you as 'change,' often to a new receiving address.
In this case it looks like you sent 5 btc from address X, but to pay the transaction fee your wallet pulled bitcoin from another address Y, since address X probably had exactly 5 btc in it. Thus the miner's fee couldn't come out of address X.
Address Y in your wallet had enough to cover the miner's fee and so the entire contents of that address were also sent, giving the strange 0.1449... figure, and then the miner's fee was taken out and the rest sent back to you.
Wallets try to obscure the fact that each wallet has multiple addresses inside it to make it easier to understand. Thus a wallet will show your balance, but that balance is actually defined by adding together all the balances in all the addresses in your wallet. Each wallet usually has at least 100 addresses pre-computed and will add more as needed.

No, they are not working together collectively. They are working together because they agree individually. There's a salient difference.
Here's an example. In a collectivist community of 100 people, let's say that all 100 agree to run their society a certain way, and all 100 vote that way. You have unanimity, and majority rule, but no one disagrees. Wonderful, that's a collectivist community deciding with unanimity to do X.
Now, suppose we have an individualist community of 100 people, and all 100 decide *for themselves* that they want policy X. Now we also have unanimity, and apparently we have the same outcome as the collectivist community. Both societies can produce the same similar outcome therefore.
But where things become obviously different is when we have disagreement.
In the collectivist community, it's say that 51 want policy X and 49 want policy Y. Because of the majority vote, the whole community adopts policy X. This is actually tyranny against the 49 who wanted policy Y and are now **forced** to accept policy X instead.
But in the individualist community a completely different outcome results.
The 51 who want policy X get policy X for themselves, and the 49 who want policy Y get policy Y. Because each individual is 100% empowered to determine their own legal circumstances.
There is no collectivist rule such as the majority vote to force the collective will on the society.
When the majority will is allowed to shove aside the individual will, you have a collectvist society, where the collective's opinions and rights are more important and more powerful than the individual's.
In the individualist society, the individual rights and decisions are allowed to stand against the entire collective if need be. Thus, even if 99 want policy X, the 1 left over is free to adopt policy Y instead and no one can force him to accept X.


Sure, I guess, kind of like bordering communities or countries.


Which would be relevant if there was only one provider of water. Which there isn't and will never be. When's the last time water-producers thirsted someone to death. It's unheard of. How about presenting a problem that's not theoretical then.
Also it would be against their economic interest to do so, so why would they?


It is not 'corruption' to refuse to sell something to someone. I can refuse to sell my labor to any company. I can refuse to sell anything I own to anyone I find objectionable for any reason. We live in that world now, and my right to not sell is an inviolable right. That is not corruption at all. In fact it's an important right. If I decide I don't like the lifestyle of X group and boycott selling to them, this is both a moral and powerful way to express my disapproval of their lifestyle, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
Stretching the definition of 'corruption' to include sales-boycotts is ridiculous.
Corruption is a function of power.  X official can make a decision over Y that Y must accept. X makes a decision for which he takes a bribe or accepts some kind of influence outside impartiality, that is also against Y's interests. That is corruption.
When you have nothing but markets, no one has political **power** over anyone else. Thus, not form of political corruption is possible anymore. And when people make laws for themselves instead of being forced to accept laws some far-off organization (Congress) makes for them, political corruption is no longer possible in the field of law either.
Because the only person who will never screw you over, is you. And the person who always has your interests in mind, is you. You are the only person ultimately capable to represent yourself in all matters. This responsibility can never be farmed off to another human being without trade-offs in how your interests will be served.
An autarchy will remove as much corruption as humanly possible, because it places each individual as the locus of control and decision-making over their own lives. And people will very quickly figure out what works and what doesn't, and there won't be any majority vote to stand in the way.

Certainly, that's how deflation works. Price drop as the currency value increases. It's the opposite of how inflation works where prices continually rise with inflation. An economy can adapt easily to either circumstance, what's tough on an economy is uncertainty. Bitcoin, having no 3rd party power that can print money should have a higher confidence rating than any major money currently in existence. You know for sure that no politician can just decide to print billions of bitcoins a day and ruin your savings. You have no assurance of that with fiat moneys, such as the dollar, the Argentine peso, or the Venezuelan Bolivar, or any other *government fiat currency*.
Only bitcoin and commodities are safe from inflation (and of the two, bitcoin is more safe. After all, even if you owned gold, it's always possible that huge gold reserves could one day be discovered, but there's no possibility of that with bitcoin).

Again, it's a world where no one can force you to do anything! Where voluntary agreement--not force--rules the day.
In other words, to translate for you, it's a world where your vote controls the conditions you live in totally. It would be like if your vote was worth 100% of the voting pool.
"Rich men" can't tell you jack in such a world, and cannot force you to do anything.
By contrast, you live in a world *right now* where "rich men" CAN and DO tell you what to do because they can buy laws, buy politicians, etc., and by that force you to do things, because your vote is only one small portion of the populace.
Do you see what I'm saying? The thing you're expressing fear of would be alleviated under the system I proposed and is your actual condition right now!

Your mistake was reusing a password. Educate yourself on security or wait until bitcoin is idiot proof with things like hardware wallets. 
But don't ditch btc, because:
* A. It's historic. And if you walk away now you'll have only a story with a crappy ending to tell people when the change is complete. Instead it can be a success story if you get back in.
* B. Don't compound the error by making an emotional decision about your involvement. You'll lose a lot more by staying out long-term, IMO.
* C. When the price is multiples of what it is today, say years from now, you'll wish you'd gotten back in despite your loss. You're one of the 0.029% of humanity whom know about and own(ed) bitcoin. You don't want to end up like the 3rd founder of Apple computer who sold his shares for like $6,000 when it would've been like $50 billion today :P
Also, there are good ways to hold bitcoin securely, with a cold-storage wallet. Go checkout You should never have trusted blockchain with that much btc unless it was only for a very short amount of time so you could buy something or the like.
Consider it a cheap price you paid for poor security practices. 1.1 btc is nothing. People have lost a great deal more being equally dumb.

Chargebacks occur because non-digital money must operate on credit until physical money or ownership thereof can be moved around to pay-back the credit.
Bitcoin is inherently digital, so there's no need to use it purely as credit when buying online. That's a structural difference, a huge one, that regular money can't match.
Retailer hate chargebacks. Consumers may indeed like the consumers protection that using a chargeback gives, but personally I've never used it.


That actually had the effect of transferring the cost of digital purchases to cash customers. Because they couldn't charge more for credit purchases, they simply raised both prices to cover that 3-4%. 
I don't see how the CC companies could do a similar thing in regards to BTC. In fact some retailers are already offering discounts for BTC purchases.

The fact that I've made more than 10% on btc purchases within a few weeks. It's gained $4 in the last week, from $20 to $24, a 20% increase in a week! That's unsustainable growth. Unsustainable growth can lead to exuberant buying and that's  a bubble. Usually emotional buying swings to extremes, highs go too high, lows go too low, that's what creates spikes and crashes.

Month 1, X earns 10 btc, saves 1.
So does everyone else. Bitcoin deflates in value significantly.
X now earns only 1 btc a month due to deflation, though the purchasing power is the same as 10 btc was a month ago.
90% of money is facilitating exchanges, 10% of it has been locked up into savings by everyone in the economy saving average 1 btc last month out of their average 10 btc earnings.
X now saves 0.1 btc, as does everyone else. It's the same value as 1 btc was a month ago. His total holdings now equal 1.1 btc.
Bitcoin deflates significiantly again due to everyone saving 10% of their earning. The 90% pool of money that circulates freely again decreases but deflates to make up for it.
X takes another pay cut, earning 0.1 btc a month. He then saves 0.01 btc next month. Total: 1.11 btc.
And so on and so forth.
You're missing the fact that there's a large pool of bitcoin that isn't locked up by anyone, that circulates just facilitating exchange. People don't save 100% of what they produce, they cannot. They save much smaller fractions of their production, and the price of bitcoin will proactively lead those lockups due to arbitrage and market expectations.

Disagree, those cannot compete against bitcoin feature for feature, it's a case of market disruption.


See, used to be if Visa locked you out of the POS system you're done. But Bitcoin requires a bit of code on a website to take a payment. They have no leverage to lock anyone out. I'm aware of Visa's dirty tricks in the past, but all of those used the same-similar POS system as Visa and MC. Bitcoin is an entirely different system that I don't believe they can exercise any leverage over in the way you suggest. It would be like Visa saying you can't take physical cash. How would they stop you? They can't. Neither can they stop bitcoin.

And they can only do this by pleasing customers.
Do you think they earn goodwill and thus customers by letting people's houses burn down?
More than likely, a fire service in a region would put the fire out first--after all it may spread to actual customers' houses otherwise--and ask for a tip afterwards to cover costs. And whom, having had their house thus saved, would be so miserly as not to be grateful.
But that's only one way to deal with the issue. It may be possible for entire cities to contract with a fire service at once, to cover regions not merely house to house basis.
Just because Parisian fire services in the 1800s used to let houses burn for nonpayment doesn't mean that's an unavoidable scenario.

A. It's silly to think current growth is representative of future growth. Uptake can follow exponential curves, when seachanges occur.
And such a seachange can occur if governments mismanage their economies and average people escape into bitcoin, a far better currency, to escape that mismanagement. With talk of a global currency war brewing, we might be on the eve of a perfect storm of conditions that drives the whole world into bitcoin sooner than we think.
B. Even most of my tech-aware friends aren't aware yet of bitcoin, or maybe have heard the word but not looked into it. That's instructive. This thing is still extremely new. But the time you're grandmother is asking about bitcoin, then we'll have total market penetration, but we're not even close to that and look already what bitcoin has achieved.
When this wave breaks, it's going to crash hard on existing financial systems. The weakest will fall first, places like Argentina and other periodically troubled currencies that fail under poor management.
Maybe some Asian nations will adopt bitcoin natively out of pure technical exuberance, Japan is known to do this sort of thing. 
The dollar might fall either in the middle of this uptake wave or at the end. Because by the time the middle east realizes they can price things in bitcoin instead of dollars--something they've been wanting to do for a very, very long time, that is to get away from the dollar--then all hell will break loose and bitcoin will be unavoidable.
**So you see, the ability to block bitcoin isn't even in the hands of the US government. If the OPEC nations decide to price oil in terms of bitcoin, the US buyers will have to exchange their dollars for bitcoin in order to buy oil.**
We know the OPEC nations desperately want to escape dollar hegemony, but where can they go? They haven't left the dollar because the only two viable candidates so far have been either the Euro, which is now embroiled in a huge mess and has lost a lot of credibility, or the Chinese Yuan, but they trust the Chinese less than the Americans.
But when they realize that bitcoin is viable and the discussions start happening. It won't matter what the US does, they won't be able to make bitcoin illegal if they have to buy oil in bitcoin.
And if the US government takes pre-emptive action against bitcoin, criminalizing it, they could actually speed up the process of other nations adopting bitcoin in order to hurt the dollar and the US politically by making international news out of it and showing that they fear it.
As an American, I cannot wait for it to happen. It's the sort of wake-up call the nation needs.

Then the price of bitcoin will be $1b / number of coins in the wild. 
Which would probably be around 11.5m coins by the end of this year let's say. Here's the [schedule]( So, a price around $90, like you say.
The next huge milestone is $1b, sure but at some point we need some national economy to buy in and accept bitcoin as a default currency.
We have a lot of work in tech and software to do before then. We need to integrate Bitcoin with NFC in cellphones to make on-site purchase quick and easy.
We need to make it far easier for a normal person to manage a wallet successfully and securely somehow.
An entire economy will probably pickup bitcoin by default, due to massive inflation in their own currency due to government mismanagement of the currency. Some place like, say, Argentina. Where, because of currency controls put up by the government to protect the currency from capital flight by the people, which is in the people's interest but not in the government's, the people may turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. And the result would be a huge buying spree.
Even if the market cap inflated to many billions by that spree, it wouldn't hurt the Argentinians buying into it, they would actually see their value increasing as early buyers, so there would be a rush into the currency. 
After that dam breaks, after bitcoin takes the place of some national currency and delegitimizes government control of their currency in one region, then all bets are off and things will get extremely interesting, and we'll look back at $20 while salivating and wishing we'd sold everything we had to buy at that price :P

Programs (to attempt) to do it exist. However, the namespace, that is the number of possible addresses, in the number 2^256 is so large that it would take probably millions or billions of years to brute-force a single address in that manner. During the entirety of which, the person owning the address could simply move their funds to a new address rendering your effort moot.
So, you're protected by an incredibly, incredibly large number. So big that it's not considered really possible to mentally grasp: 2^256 that's a mindboggling number.
Put it this way, there's aren't 2^256 grains of sand in all the oceans and beaches in the world, but it's worse than that, there aren't even 2^256 *atoms in the whole earth*. There aren't even 2^256 atoms in our entire solar system, sun included, nor in our entire **galaxy**, nor in several millions of galaxies.
So, bruteforcing an address would be much worse than finding a needle in a haystack, it's like finding a single atom in a galaxy, or a whole host of galaxies.

Suppose you have a colored coin. You associate it in some way with a physical object, it could represent title to a car or a house. If you control the wallet it's in, you can prove that you own it thereby.
It is possible to encode a tracking number into a real-world object in such a way that it cannot be removed without destroying the object. Eg: a gun could have placed into its alloy thousands of microscopic tags. They can't be simply scratched off like a registration number because they infuse the whole alloy of the weapon. You could do a similar thing with car-frames and concrete foundations on houses, plastics would be easy, etc.
By this means you could actually encode ownership of a house into a brainwallet, or any wallet, without the need for 3rd party trust in a title company. Essentially, the block-chain acts as a distributed title-record.
Transferring ownership then would require the known means of bitcoin escrow that you elaborated.
I'm sure I don't have a handle on all the angles yet, but it's one way that bitcoin could impact the title and escrow industries that exist now, and further remove property ownership into cyberspace.
In fact it's the idea of abandoning 3rd party trust in all spheres of life that particularly attracts me. Representative government is the eventual target, the worst form of 3rd party trust, and working on ideas related to that direction is my primary interest.

Bitcoin's volatility is 99% due to its newness, unproven track-record, and the fact that its price is demand-driven and very few people know about it.
The speculators jumped out of the frenzy in April and the true market value is currently around $100. Great. 
As more people realize it's a fantastic currency for internet and long-distance transactions, its value will steadily rise.
When it's a mature technology with many more years of track record -and- everyone knows about it, then its demand can be said to have been essentially maximized and it will have found its true market value. Also there won't be much point in speculating anymore so we won't see huge buy spikes and drops. And that value will remain relatively rock solid at that point.
And at that point it will be a far safer currency in terms of existential risk than either gold or paper fiat currency.
The gov can always print more dollars. New gold mines can always be found.
You can never create more than 21 million bitcoin. End of story.
So, while bitcoin is wild-wild-west right now, it's volatility, to the extent that it's a problem, is a problem that will reconcile in time.
Meanwhile, fiat's inflation vulnerability is a problem that can **never be fixed** and will always hang over fiat like the Sword of Damocles. Gold is less risky, but still risky in that same sense.
Bitcoin is a fantastic money and will only become better with time.
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:42:49
:) 
I don't think any of them are insurmountable. Meanwhile, gold has exhausted its developmental options, and fiat is dead and dying long-term because the manager of any currency always manages it in their own favor.
Only a digital currency can move forward into the world we're finding ourselves in. It will be interesting if nations try to pivot to create crypto-based currencies controlled by their central banks.
But what possible advantage could there be to using it? Once a free-market currency exists that cannot be regulated away, it's the reverse of Gresham's law: good currency will *driveth* out the bad.
Many of the things you cite as problems also existed for practically every modern technology that's come down the road. The ones that have suffused themselves into every day life were more valuable in use than the cost of learning to use them.
Bitcoin seems to fall into that rubric even more strongly than some tech we use all the time.

No one should pay taxes. And no one should *want* to pay taxes either. You've been brainwashed into being taxed for something that really is nothing more than the government forcing you to buy something.
Imagine if you were taxed for food and drink too, and had that government provided.
If you want something, you'll pay for it voluntarily. Those who don't want to chip in can be excluded territorially.


Not talking about donations, I'm talking about purchasing. Why do roads and school need to be gratis? They simply don't.
And they weren't free historically either. And, surprise surprise, they were much better before they were free.


Then the beast can fuck off, because there's a better way, one where no one has to pay for what they don't want.


You know what, we need to get rid of voting too. Voting is nothing more than the political legitimation of the use of force. Just because 51% vote for something we say it's therefore alright to force that something on the 49% who don't want it. But that's an unethical aggression.
Let the 51 have what they want, let the 49 have what they want, and never the twain shall meet. What's wrong with that? Why do we have to force our will on the minority? Democracy is immoral; see ["Democracy the God that Failed."](
Democracy has all sorts of unearned prestige. It may have been better than past societal structures, but we've tended now to hold it up as if it's the end all, be all of politics, when it's not. There's something better: pure political individualism, eg: autarchy.


Let them do what they want and I'll do what I want. By pushing voting you actually are saying I must accept the idiot will of the masses. And then you admit it right here.
Well, I don't accept it. Down with voting. Down with democracy.

Sort of. The diff increases every 2 weeks and can increase or decrease max by a factor of 4. So if you suddenly brought online a massive amount of hashing power you could chew through blocks rapidly for 2 weeks, but it would rapidly adjust thereafter.
So, it could be done, but it wouldn't be very effective in any case, much less profitable. Long term it'd be little more than a blip. A few thousands of coins issued faster than expected and that's all.

It doesn't. The private key is just hashed in order to obtain the public address, and one one pub-add will result from this. So, if you have the private key you can derive the public address no problem.
The wallet file is a collection of unrelated key-pairs, and are auto-generated as needed just like any new keypair. You have one main address that is associated with the wallet, the original one, but it does some automatic creation of addresses when you send coin, often receiving the change on a new address to further obfuscate the payment graph.
But if you lose the wallet, those keys are gone even if you know the main keys.
The client will attempt to make things easy for you by collecting all the address balances into a single balance so you know your overall balance, but that doesn't mean they're all in one wallet.
I've heard people say that some clients are able to create strings of related keys but I don't have any hard evidence of that, and some people have told me conflicting info. AFAIK, lose the wallet and you lose all the other keys too, even if you know the main key-pair.
This is why a cold-storage paper-wallet is a bit more reliable, because it's so simple. One key-pair, all out in the open, no hidden private key, no encryption, pure physical security.

To the contrary, it's low market cap and illiquidity are barriers to adoption right now. For instance, it would be impossible for bitcoin in its present state to serve as the unit of account for oil transactions. It needs orders of magnitude larger market cap first.
Which really means that bitcoin will have to spread across the web's online stores before something like that will be possible.


That's never stopped people from investing in, for instance, Google or Microsoft. Plus, those people becoming rich hurts no one, only rewards them for their foresight and wisdom, and for making this thing that benefits everyone!

Sure, but I think such attacks aren't aiming to delegitimize bitcoin so much as manipulate the price in order to profit within the system.
Secondly, such attacks become harder and more expensive as time goes on, and become thereby less impactful too. As terahashes/sec increase, it becomes increasingly expensive to make waves with new hashing power.
In any case, those with faith in the system would buy up any panic sell, and profit would favor those who forecast correctly. Wonderful how that works.

Voluntary subscriptions. What services do you pay for already? Why do you pay them?
What would you actually pay for? Government forces you to buy certain services from them and pay via taxation.
But there's no reason why governments have to offer these services, except that governments pass laws giving themselves monopolies for those services.
We can and do buy police protection from private companies, as well as dispute resolution from private arbitrators.
Buying it from a government just means you'll overpay and be underserved, since you're getting a service from a monopoly provider that has you as a captive audience.

It does matter, though, because certain transactions can only be performed if the market cap and liquidity are much, much higher than they are today.
Let's say you want to do an international oil sale to the tune of $12 billion. You simply can't do that in bitcoin today--that is a multiple of the total value of all outstanding bitcoin.
And that's just one example. There's a lot of industries where we'd need much higher market cap to facilitate bitcoin's use there. An average chip fab is $2 billion, for instance.


Sure, but if all bitcoin becomes is a remittance tool, it will have failed to live up to its potential. That's what I meant by 'useless.'

No, the better strategy is usually to play against them. That's difficult right now with limited futures trading ability.
If a dump happened every sunday predictably, you could make much more profit better it would happen then they would make trying to do it. And the net result is it would even out the market price, and thus be a useful outcome.


True enough, but bitcoin is still so young that we will keep seeing big dumps periodically for the next many years. There's still individuals with dozens of thousands of coins out there.
Satoshi Nakamoto hasn't sold any of his even, and that's a 1 million+ BTC fortune.

To strength my denial of your 'deflation = theft' stance, imagine someone buys into a currency that has already greatly deflated. They lose no amount of that value in the process, and benefit from future deflation. This is one reason why it doesn't matter what price bitcoin reaches, it can act as money at any price, because value is maintained by buying in.
But losing out on past gains because someone didn't buy in till later can hardly be called theft.
And the value someone gains by buying in and holding early is in part payment for risk taking and good projection of the future, which ends up helping the whole economy become more productive. So, the whole society benefits by early adoption, and tho they're paid in deflation for correct forecasting, they're also enabling a productive idea to flourish within society, in essence paying that society back with it also, and to a greater extent than they earned wealth themselves.
Does anyone doubt that Satoshi Nakamoto or Gavin will enable far more wealth to be created than they themselves will ever see by being an early miner?
Satoshi could be the world's first trillionaire for all I know by the time the dust settles, but he still will have enable many, many trillions more to be earned by others that would have been lost or unrealized in the previous financial system.

That just means the universe can likely expand without limit. I think that is accurate, but it is continually expanding and therefore will always be finite.
There was a point when the entire universe was smaller than the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Post big-bang it has been expanding ever since. This suggests there's an 'edge' to the universe, believe it or not. We will probably never be able to reach this edge however, so for all intents and purposes it's infinite, but it is not an actual infinite.

I intended focus to be on the word 'deserves' in that statement. Ie: that society does not owe everyone property just for being alive.
In the case of inheritance, people are receiving property that they didn't deserve and yes, didn't earn. But it is the right of the owner to give property to whomever they want for whatever reason. And society should not interfere with that at all.
At the same time, I would equally reject attempts to force value from others to give it to people without property. Property transfers should always be a function of free exchange.

Then the level of security is entirely up to the passphrase you choose. It's possible to choose a passphrase that maximizes your security up to the same level as a randomly generated private key, as well as use an awful passphrase that is immediately cracked.
So, passphrases / ie: brainwallets, potentially much less secure unless you know what you're doing.
Many suggest a minimum of a 12 word passphrase for this reason.
Done correctly it's very secure. Done poorly, not at all.
I'd expect most people to lose their bitcoins over a badly crafted brainwallet passphrase rather than outright cracking bruteforce.

[The Blockchain Not Taken](
Two blockchains diverged on a yellow monday,
And sorry I could not process them both
And be one miner, long I sat
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it were discussed on bitcointalk,
Then took the other, as just as fair
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Being the older 0.7 version,
Though as for that, the mining there
Had validated them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In cyberspace no government had trodden black
Oh, I kept the new release for another day!
Yet knowing how transaction leads on to transaction,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
two blockchains diverged in cyberspace, and I --
I mined the one less incompatible,
And that has made all the difference.

There wouldn't be free healthcare, but that's good. No one should use the law to thieve value from other people. People should earn their own way. When the government is not running a service, it ends up being cheaper and better overall. The very poor can rely on charity. The middle class would be able to afford insurance. A lot of the high cost of health care now is due to government regulations and lawsuits and the like.


Do we have good public schools now? Hardly. The best ones are private. In a private school the system wouldn't be beholden to unions, bad teachers couldn't hide under tenure for a lifetime, etc. And you wouldn't be forced to go to X school just because it was in your neighborhood. Competition for students would exist. Would result in schools far more responsive and better than we have now.


You pay for roads already now in gas prices, and you overpay and are underserviced too, because governments provide it. If you paid for use under a private road system there's a lot of benefits like less traffic jams and fewer potholes in all likelihood.


In capitalist societies, the luxuries of the ultrarich soon become luxuries of the middle class. We all now live better than kings once did. In the society I propose, gated communities would be prevalent indeed, since they're entirely private, but it's likely middle-classes would make them extensively as well, since right now you need gov permission to make one, and in what I propose you do not.


People seem to think a more capitalist society would mean a more extreme wealth division. This isn't true. Before capitalism took hold there was almost exclusively only the very poor and the very rich whom lived by exploiting the masses.
Capitalism's arrival quite literally created the middle class. People who think capitalism would destroy the middle class when it's capitalism that invented it simply don't know what they're talking about.

Fish are a special case, they roam widely. I think individual groups or units should be owned and given easements, rather than letting each region they pass poach freely. Solves that.


Not really. Time is coming when GPS will extend over all the oceans as well.


You fundamentally misunderstand how to do business then. If you own a group of fish you're interested also in their capital value. Harvesting them all would ruin their capital value thus putting you out of business. It's in your interest to make a going concern out of them or harvest that capital value by selling them off to someone who values them higher.
When we see businesses rushing in and harvesting everything they can, it's inevitably when they haven't been allowed to own that thing but only to rent harvest rights, such as in the case of clear-cutting and deepwater fishing.
When companies own sections of fores they don't clearcut, that harms the capital value of the property, they tree farm carefully. Same would and indeed must happen with fishing, because wild stocks are nearly depleted and if we don't allow fish ownership we're going to extinct many food stocks soon.


You might start off with a stock company selling off shares that converts into a management company of the fish stock. I wouldn't use a government. They're too careless and inefficient by nature.


Local fish-farms built on the open ocean. It will prove more profitable and practical than open-sea fishing. It's like the difference between wild-harvest and actual agriculture. When you fish, you're just hunting/gathering. When you fish-farm, you're performing aquaculture, and have now both a more consistent catch and the ability to generate far more than the wild might have provided, due to careful cultivation.
Watch it in action, i think your concerns will melt away.

That's a good phrase for the phenomena we're living through right now. It's unprecedented and will only make sense in retrospect, if indeed that turns out to be what has happened.
If the price stabilizes very high compared to expectations, then it will be scarcity-shock, and if the bubble pops then perhaps it's overenthusiasm again. But the longer this goes on the more like scarcity-shock it seems.

Bitcoin is an anti-fragile network.
@_date: 2013-02-18 10:51:37


Nothing, they exist now. Except that momentum and the network effect often means the first mover in a situation like this will be the standout. It's like saying what's to keep a new Microsoft from starting up, but MS and Windows cemented their position unshakeably, and I think bitcoin is in a similar position that its clones won't achieve unless for some unforeseen reason Bitcoin were to lose people's confidence. Thus, there's still some existential risk, but it's not much different from the kind of risk you take with any currency, that that currency will remain viable and good and not hyperinflate, etc. Actually bitcoin is preferable compared to other mainstream currencies under that rubric.


It's not purely social in value, it's facilitating exchanges right now, today, and that's an economic value.


There are very good arguments against this, though many austrians have said something similar.
Primarily, if your digital currency is to be merely a receipt for a tangible good, ie: if each of your 'digicoins' stood for say 1 ounce of gold, then you still have lots of new problems that don't maximize the potential of digital currencies.
For one thing, you're still liable to inflation, for you're relying on the storer of that gold to not issue more than one receipt for each piece of gold, whereas historically banks have issued as many as 40:1 receipts to pieces of gold, and probably more in some cases.
So you have to have the whole money supply audited periodically. Then you have to be able to trust the auditer. Next your whole currency is still vulnerable to the nation hosting it. Say this stockpile were held in the US, the US has used the law to seize private gold stores before. There's no doubt they'd do so again if the dollar were repudiated. That's what Fort Knox exists for, as insurance in case the dollar ever gets repudiated, gold to serve as backing for a new currency.
On the other hand, bitcoin is a "pure" currency, a currency whose primary value is its ease of use as currency, which seems circular but isn't. Sure its origins of value were in speculation, but its economic use is in exchange, and it's the best in what it specializes in: digital exchange facilitation.

I'll tell you a secret: the value of bitcoin is not likely to collapse.
Those who understand what I mean when I say that bitcoin is the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions--really understand that in technical economic terms--understand that bitcoin has a unique value proposition among all currencies.
Then ask yourself if distanced and online transactions are likely to become more common in the future or less common. It's pretty clear.
The only risk factor is the protocol's bullet-proofness and whether when bugs are found they prove unpatchable--which is also rather unlikely.
Most people don't know economics or the theory of money well enough to know how much faith to put in bitcoin, most people don't know enough about programming to appreciate Nakamoto's care in building it in as close to a bulletproof manner as possible.
**Those of us who do understand these things are already all-in with bitcoin.** 
And that's what those people who don't are looking at when trying to decide what they should do themselves. 
My relative doesn't know the first thing about computers or how bitcoin works, but he knew me and knew what I'd done with my own money, and that was enough for him.
Long story short, he's not sorry he got into bitcoin at my urging :P

If I were you I'd go look at the original white-paper by Satoshi Nakamoto and find the exact algorithm used. You could implement it yourself if you wanted to. The public address is created by an algorithm that hashes the private key. It's not trivial math by any means. But if two separate services gave you the same public address from the same private key, I'd consider that assurance enough.

Indeed. I think we have a wave of popularization just as the reward-halving occurred, resulting in a rush for coin, one that I myself participated in.

Apparently the guys on bitcointalk said it could be done with some DDR-3, so I don't know if you're correct on that score. I don't see why it would need that sort of low-level memory necessarily. My understanding is just that it requires a lot of memory per hash, and thus a GPU simply doesn't have enough RAM to do very much with scrypt. But you give an FPGA about 8 gigs of DDR-3 and you can get say 500 mega to 1 giga-hash, that would be exceptional for Litecoin.

It can be both. All currencies have value in part derived from their value as a medium of exchange and from their value as a value-store.
Bitcoin has much more value-store value than other currencies because it's got a hard lock on inflation.
And since bitcoin has the lowest possible transaction costs of all currencies, it's also very valuable as a currency, just knowledge of it and use hasn't filtered out to all those who would be using it right now if they knew about it.

How to transition away from an unethical retirement system is an entirely different question from whether they are unethical or not. And having determined they are unethical our first task must be to stop propagating them.
So the first step is to end forced retirement savings on the young, to let them either opt out entirely or begin phasing it out.
There is going to be pain in the financials at some point because far too much has been promised, more than can realistically be paid.
So the next step is to get these things back to realism.
For those already retired and dependent, not much you can do. They relied on the system and it would not be humane to cut them off. They'll have to continue with the system.
But for those not yet retired, the benefits should be frozen. No more increases in payment or benefit. The retirement age should be move up for non-retired people.
The younger people should be given option to move their retirement to private plans, possibly including a small payout that would pay them out of the system, and a reduction in the retirement benefit tax, if not a complete axing of that tax yet, lest the financials explode.
Now you're on a path to eliminating gov retirement benefits as gradually and sanely as possible.
But it will never happen because it cannot happen politically.

Eventually the tipping point comes, when mass awareness hits, when some event triggers a flood into bitcoin--such as a major economy floundering financially.
In the past, if a country inflated its currency to hell the people were stuck. Now, it would be possible to get out via technological means.
In the same way that many countries around the world have de facto become dollar economies, such as Russia after the USSR failed, we may see economies become bitcoin economies if the dollar falters.

You need to control 51% of the hashing power of the entire network to dictate to the rules to the other 49%. The fact that no one has 51% hashing power is what keeps this rule in place. Absent that, it is agreement by 51% of the miners that keeps the rule in place, for they can change anything the majority agrees upon.

I began thinking about questions like this when wondering how to get bitcoin *into* Egypt as their currency controls hit and value began crashing.
Here's how to do it. What your friend needs to do is to accept that he's gonna take a % hit to get this value out of the country, but it's doable.
What he needs to do is buy a convertible asset and ship that out of the country.
A good asset would be to buy something like bulk copper and then send that out of the country, where he can sell it for close to what he paid and thus recover value out of it. 
He could buy art, something that will masquerade as a personal possession, but that would hold value. Perhaps a very expensive car or series of cars, but those'd be quite expensive to ship out.
The key is here you want to buy something from the Iraqi economy that will hold value outside of it. Then you should be satisfying their demands to spend it there while retaining a convertible asset. Hell you could buy bricks and maybe even export them at a profit :P
Find out what people are importing *from* Iraq to other nations in volume, get in touch with those importer/exporters, and work out a deal where you put up the cash for one of their shipments from local Iraqis and they buy it back from you at a small discount once you get state-side or wherever you're going. Or simply buy up the same asset and do it yourself on the other side.
It's gonna take some effort, thinking, and some excess cost, but you should be able to repatriate the value, even if you can't repatriate the money directly.
Then buy bitcoin! :)
I don't know if this idea could be considered illegal or money laundering or anything like that, honestly, but it seems to me that I'm suggesting a method that use voluntary transactions and follows all the laws, makes no use of fraud or anything like that, and everyone should be happy.

They had an open house with all kinds of independent people there asking tons of questions, and they were satisfied with the answers.

I think a lot of people wanted to buy over the weekend, so we got a weekend of built-up exuberant demand that couldn't be satisfied until monday.
BAM, huge and voluminous transactions hit the market, 40% gain in 48 hours, but that couldn't be sustained, it was built up weekend demand, okay, the market stutters a bit, so now people are jittery that it's the top of the price gain and a few began to SELL SELL SELL.
But demand still exists in the system and what we have is huge volatility right now.
Once again, transfers of bitcoin are going from those with fear to those with vision.
You should know what your overall average cost basis is, and you should be happy as long as you're over that, and never sell under it. Why lock in a loss that could become a profit tomorrow, unless you need the money immediately, and in that case you screwed up.

Taxes will be replaced by voluntary subscriptions--no one will be able to forcibly take money from you, not even a government.
Central control of finance and central banks will be replaced by a free market and decentralized market decision-making, which will be a huge improvement generally.
It will serve as the opening bell tolling the coming of future free societies that are actually free, or perhaps the deathknell of centrally-planned societies.

The present price fluctuation is simply the result of the youth of bitcoin and the shallowness of its liquidity and small market cap.
Individual players with a few million dollars can create price movements at will. This state of affairs won't last forever.
As market cap increases and trading volume of price manipulators gets drowned in legitimate trade volume, and confidence in the system grows, the price will both increase and fluctuations will level out.
Does anyone imagine we'll still be seeing 40% price fluctuation within a week in four years? I don't.

Monopoly can't exist outside government collusion, so I doubt it. And the question is also whether security would expensive efficiency gains from large economy of scale, and I see now reason to think they would.
Right now we see security and police departments that don't range larger than city size. In a free market there'd be multiple companies specializing in multiple types of security all overlapping each other. General security, site security, detective services, investigative, etc.
If one drops the ball they could easily face parallel competition from another specialization looking to branch out.


They can only make a profit however by pleasing customers. This fact is too often overlooked.


They would become a criminal organization and the city in question could very quickly hire five outside security organizations to come bust them up. Further, most people aren't willing to become aggressors, even in the quest to make a profit. Profit is not the only value people hold. People want to make a profit, but not at the cost of becoming a murderer, otherwise there would only be bank robbers and no bank customers. It's always more profitable to steal than to pay for your food, for instance, yet people pay willingly.


In an autarchy where the very principle of anyone forcing laws on other has been rejected, this is an impossibility. Besides which, the situation you cast is the one we live under now, it would at best be parity even if you're right.

Taxes persist because people believe they're a necessary evil. But have you even stopped to think critically about that statement--maybe you've been brainwashed?
Many of us have looked at the issue and concluded that not only are taxes not necessary for the operation of a large-scale society, they are inherently unethical.
There's nothing a government can do that the market cannot do, since the government is simply paying market providers to do everything via money taken from taxation. The citizenry may as well pay the service providers directly, on the free market, and cut out the governmental middle-man.

Assuming difficulty stays the same, which it won't when they all ship. This actually makes ASICs a pretty risky investment. The difficulty could actually double with the first shipment, pushing ROI out to a year or more immediately, and dropping earnings to just above cost of electricity. The first guy who turned one on ahead of everyone made out like a bandit, but the rest won't be so lucky.
Also, the business has immediate materials cost and has a guaranteed ROI of w/e profit margin they went for at a set price, and these are already sold, and were sold long before bitcoin quintupled in price last couple months.

Again, the IP problem. Ideas are not actualities; if you give me an idea you did not lose a copy of that idea yourself. Bitcoin can't be reasoned with legally as if it were an infinitely copyable IP.

The generative act of building bitcoin is far harder, and requires intense skill in specific areas.

...If the supply of rupees inflates then its value in terms of other currencies deflates, like a balloon, if that's what you mean. 
But since fiat currencies are stated value on their face, when the supply inflates, the prices of things priced in that currency begin to go up to account for the decreased value of each unit of currency, creating price inflation generally. So the supply of the currency inflates, and the price of things priced in that currency also inflates.

I mean they can't do it ethically.






In the scenario I painted, there is no government. Governments are collectivist institutions that exist to make decisions for you, like how to spend your money and what laws to force on you. 
In a world where legal circumstances are individually decided, there's no room for a politician to even exist. An individualist political order would mean the end of politics. Thank god, finally.


But the key is that your decisions only affect yourself while on your property and anyone visiting your property.
If you leave your property and visit another's, you'll have to negotiate the basis of your visit, and under what legal terms and conditions you may visit, and this agreement becomes law between you and the owner, and you can be prosecuted for violating what you agreed to.
Thus, if you visit a shopping mall, you will undoubtedly be asked not to steal or assault people, and will agree ahead of time to the risk of prosecution and resulting jail time or even execution if you violate that agreement.
The result is agreement-based law, or crowd-sourced law, a form of [polycentric law](


It's not that they couldn't be solved the way I suggest, it's just that it's hard to implement in a large society. Small societies operate exactly the way I'm suggesting here, just informally and by word of mouth, etc.
However, with the internet and computers, it's not possible to export this way of living into a large society.
If you don't think that would work, give me an example of a disagreement that can't be solved by everyone doing their own thing and we'll walk through it.


You don't really need that for that. Because no one wants to be stolen from, thus they're agreeing that theft would be wrong, both against them and for them to do to others.
As for paying taxes, with no politicians there would also be no taxes and no public land. Taxation would be done away with permanently.


There would still be police and courts in such a society, they would simply be free market police and free market courts.

Apart from envy-factor I fail to see how this hurts anyone. Early adopters are being paid for taking a large risk on what was then virtually a ludicrous idea for all intents and purposes. They launched bitcoin to this point.


0.029% of humanity roughly, something like half a million at best. But the price of bitcoin is immaterial to its use as a currency. $100 worth of bitcoin is $100 worth of bitcoin where that comes out to 5 bitcoins or 0.001 bitcoins. Either scenario is equally good for a transaction, only the 0.001 can accommodate many more and much larger transactions.


I think it's pretty awesome, especially since many of those people are libertarians \^_~ 
Bitcoin will fund peaceful revolutions. The biggest problem with seasteading is that it's so goddamn expensive to get it going. I think we may have just solved that problem indirectly :)
Ultimately time solves this concentration situation, as people die and inheritance splits money up, and succeeding generations spend it, etc.


I think you're wrong. It's like saying there's something wrong with Bill Gates getting so much money from starting Microsoft. These people are rich because they've made all of humanity very much more money than they themselves received, just as Gates has received billions for the trillions he's enabled to be earned. Every rich person who earns their money legitimately creates far more wealth than they themselves receive, and bitcoin millionaires are no different.
Honestly it just sounds like envy on your part. There's no direct negative to these bitcoin millionaires having been made by bitcoin's success anymore than Gates's billions hurt anyone. Quite the opposite.
As for the network, lookup the network effect. It's the most valuable cryptocurrency network by a grand margin.


Any rival they'd produce would dispense with decentralization and thus remove much of the virtue of bitcoin entirely, and thus won't see uptake as bitcoin has. It won't happen. Any such attempt would be no better than just another fiat currency. People have already chosen bitcoin over every form of existing fiat, including the pre-eminent version: the US dollar.


They wouldn't.

I'm of the opinion that the price must increase for demand to broaden, meaning bitcoin is only suitable as a currency in certain markets at a certain capitalization. Ie: If OPEC nations wanted to price oil in bitcoin, it would have to be much more highly valued than currently, as to increase liquidity and the like. But I think this is something they would like to do, once the market cap makes it possible, somewhere on the order of $100b market cap or so. So in that limited sense, perhaps it is a Giffen good. 
Another scenario is currency traders, for whom bitcoin will need more liquidity and market cap before they can move in and begin doing business.
And before entire large economies can adopt bitcoin as a replacement currency, should they ever do so, the market cap will want to be much higher as well.

time to catch up with the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:09:19
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:01:07
Part 1:


Discussion is not voting. Is it direct democracy if I discuss what I want to have for dinner with friends and family and then choose the lobster? No. 


Democracy means that the collective decides. I propose a scenario where the collective never decides--the individual decides. So it is perhaps *like* direct democracy, and maybe that's why you're continually confused on this point, but it's actual autarchy, because direct democracy involves giving over the decision to the collective, whereas autarchy makes each individual the most powerful vote, **which can never happen in direct democracy**.


No it's just going to be true regardless of legal method used.


This also happens in tyrannies. Direct democracy?


Nope. I've tried very carefully to explain why NO ONE is this proposed scenario is TIED to the decisions of the group. Each person makes their own choice and no one else has ANY say.
You seem incapable of seeing anything but 'direct democracy' despite this being a different beast. There is not group voting in autarchy, there is only an individual voting and the vote affects only himself. In direct democracy the group vote and the group decision is forced on everyone. It's **entirely different**.
As an example, if someone was in a community and wanted to immediately toss off their existing law-set and start an entirely new law-set from scratch, basically forming a new city on the spot, they could do so without anyone's permission.
Try that in a direct democracy.




They're free to build unique sets.


GPS lookup of the law requirements. They would only need to know your laws if they're walking onto your property. Laws would automatically be served to them digitally via GPS lookup of the data. It's a simple thing that could be done right now very easily.


No moreso than a website does.


Lookup the idea of polycentric law, for my descriptions of a society here are a means to creating that. People would have to agree to people's rules the first time they went somewhere in the city, yes.
But there's a couple possible scenario from there. Either they could have that agreement carry over to any other place that has an identical law-set (this is likely for things like roads in a region and commercial centers in a region). Or they could have the agreement carry over on a case by case basis assuming the laws of a place never change.
Thus they might spend the first week in a new area agreeing to abide by the rules of various places they want to go, but thereafter unless the laws change they wouldn't be bothered by it again.
So it really wouldn't be much different from now except for that opening agreement early on. After that they'd move about at will with the agreements already in place.




There is no 'city in general.' All land is privately owned, including roads and parks. This is an ideal ancap society, remember?


You're always on *someone's* property, either your own or someone else's, thus you're always under someone's law-set. No contradiction. Not okay to mug.


Then I would've agreed to be there under that law set too and I would be unable to sue if you beat me, yes. However I would also be an idiot for agreeing to set foot on land without such a law and I would not repeat that mistake. More than likely the scenario could not take place because no one would reasonably agree to set foot on that land in the first place. 


I said there'd be no conflicting laws on any one property, not that there'd be no conflicts between people.


What would they use, the sidewalk? These are private communities guarded by security services, and likely walled. If you try to force your way in you'll be met with force to stop you, since that's an invasion of private property.

Now $40.20. 
I'm not sure I'd call a drop from 49 to 40 a large drop compared to the gains we've seen. It's too early to call :) I think there was a lot of pent-up demand over the weekend which exploded into monday, and we may still see a creeping up trend.
But clearly the events of the last 24 hours show that the price is struggling, and we may soon find an equilibrium point where the price is too high to sustain demand.
What we haven't seen is a sudden crash down to single digits :P
I always expected a drop-off from a high and then a near-price stabilization. So we're still within my expectations.
If it crash to below $20 I'd be very surprised. But also happy! Since I'd be able to mop up a lot of coins! There's really no negative scenario here for me at least.

'Set' as in cannot be altered and is known. Not 'set' as in constant over time. Yes, you're correct that it will halve again in 2017. So tell me, when will Bernanke print them trillion dollar coins? You have no idea, that's the point.


At the cap of 21m bitcoin, bitcoin will have either won or lost by that point. If it wins, then miners will keep mining to earn transaction fees.
As for the satoshi-cap, if we ever needed to subdivide below satoshis, and it's possible perhaps in a hundred years, then we can move to the [Tonal numbering system]( which allows for infinite division. 


Tonal bitcoins will prevent that.


It's actually a bigger problem for gold. Gold coins were too valuable for their size. You couldn't buy bread with gold, it would be a coin the size of a pinhead. Thus they used silver.
With tonal infinite division, this is a non-issue for bitcoin. But also one we don't need to worry about for a very long time.

Nations grow wealth the same way people do: by producing more than they consume.
This wealth is typically either saved in the form of cash equivalent: "savings," or else turned into goods that we think of as physical wealth, a nicer car, a nicer house, etc.
If people horde bitcoin because of inflation, they are in essence saving. Demand would then decrease compared to if we had an inflationary currency, but the effect would actually be fairly negligible (unless deflation were very rapid--which can't ever last for long). 
What's important about prices is that they communicate to an entire economy. When you pump an economy by inflating, the price of goods goes up and produces take this as a cue to produce more, it looks to them like more people are demanding their goods. This isn't necessarily true, it's just inflation making everything cost more. Sometimes this turns into a bubble and results in market disruption in various industries when industry over-produces in reaction, and businesses can easily go bankrupt thereby.
In a deflationary economy you'd have the opposite effect. Prices would continually be going down, so production would tend to decrease on the more conservative side, which cause a relative shortage of that good, which causes people to demand more of it and causes the price of it to go up, which helps it find its true price again but without causing the business to potentially go under by overextending.
As for wealth generation, think about it this way. A man is a hunter. He can hunt a rabbit or an elk. With poor tools he can hunt rabbit. But he has to be careful. It's possible to spend more calories killing rabbit than you'd get from eating it. If he produces 500 calories worth of rabbit at a cost of 700 calories of effort, he has lost, produced nothing, and will die if that continues. This is like someone who has more debt service than income and they'll go bankrupt. They are eating their wealth up to nothing.
If he produces 500 calories of rabbit on 500 calories of effort, he's barely surviving. This is someone treading water financially, saving nothing. 
But if he kills an elk using 500 calories and gains 14,000 calories of meat, now he's got real wealth. He can spend a few leisurely days at least doing nothing, for he's *made a killing* out there. He can save that meat, smoke it, etc. That extra he produced is like wealth, he's produced more than he consumed. He can trade that away because he has more than he needs, trade it for something else he wants other than food, etc.
I think part of the confusion is that a medium of exchange isn't consumed when it's spent, so you have to separate the two. Wealth is sometimes held in terms of money, but not always. Having more money can buy whatever you value highly, and that to you is wealth. That could be productive capital, a new car, or a family, etc.

I should think as the market cap goes up you'd want transaction volume to increase correspondingly.

For many people, higher price = legitimacy.
Few took it seriously sub $1. Lots of early people without vision sold looots of bitcoin when it broke $1 - $2 and thereabouts.
At $12 such as early this year, up to $100, it's a curiosity.
When they are introduced to bitcoin at, say, $100 and then personally witness it got to $800 during that time period, that triggers a significant loss reflex.
Here I was, urging them to buy bitcoin at, what price? Around $100, $120, earlier this year. They demurred, though a few did buy. 
They're doing the math in their head what they could've had.
Now the want in so as not to miss the next round.
Just being a cool tech means little to most people. They want in on it as an emerging value store and secondarily a currency.

@_date: 2013-05-27 00:07:50


There's a twist of thinking here. You have to think that what a court does is legitimate the use of coercion to right a property violation.
So if you have a court order to recover say $5,000 in wages that the employer owes you, if he comes to court or not doesn't matter. You can take that court order to his bank and seize from his account $5k, much like the gov does now.
He will likely come to court then, to defend himself.
Another mechanism of 'coming to trial' assurance that was used in ancient Ireland was that if one person refused to come to court then they were blackballed by the court system as a whole and could never make use of it again. They became, in effect, outlaws that anyone could attack without recompense. So you came to court or become persona non grata forever.
That's just two ways. There may be more. But we don't need government.


Since you're both paying you'll both have to agree on the venue for the trial. So if your employer even suspects collusion, he'll simply veto your court choice and demand an outside court, one neither of you have any association with but that has a good reputation. Then it's as close to fair as could be expected.
And if you suspect he's bribed this court already, then you veto it and ask for another court instead.
So, it's fair because both participants must agree on a venue, and because either can deny any particular venue, and no one can bribe everyone. And because these courts are literally trading on their reputation, and even the slightest doubt as to their independence puts them out of business entirely, so they have a strong interest in avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.

Very good point. 
It would also be worth it for    groups to smuggle large amounts of currency (or gold / other commodity) out and exchange them somewhere for dollars, change that into bitcoin, and repatriate the bitcoins. That way you don't have to smuggle anything back in and risk getting caught with them, and you still have a dollar equivalent: bitcoin.
I'll bet the dollar smugglers hit on this idea sooner or later. God bless'em.

I'll trace for you the heritage of its use in Russia. First there were the anarchists whom got the idea into their heads that the private ownership of property was the root of all evil, back in days of William Godwin and Proudhon. They reasoned that government was supporting private ownership.
They began targeting government and business leaders, believing that killing these leaders would cause the natural end of private ownership, but it did not. They sparked off WWI this way after a series of assassinations.
Along came Marx who figured what you need to do is not to destroy the government, but to use the power of government to achieve the end of the anarchists, to have the lower class rise up and take over government.
Of course no class can rule a nation, so these marxist revolutions inevitably created an autocratic ruling class of communists whom were the new power and ruling elite, worse than the people they replaced.
Thus did Russia become a tyranny trying to carry out the ends of the anarchs by immoral means.
If you mean to say that this result is not what is intended by socialism and communism, you are correct, because those ends can never be realized in the real world. There will never be a world without private ownership of property, it is impossible, never be a world without money. There is no socialist utopia around the corner.

It took me two weeks to get a grasp on it, as a semi-tech head non-programmer, and still learning new things now.
I'm a libertarian too, so from that POV this is the best currency that humanity has ever developed.
I'd say the best assurance that you can trust it is the actions of those in the know, those who've put thousands and millions of their own money into bitcoin, having done their research.
It's natural not to trust that which you don't understand. At the same time you don't need to understand the math behind it, just how it works. So take the time to do your research, read others' questions and answers, and then take it from there.

Deflation only defeats the loans that would've been made on marginally profitable investments.
This is balanced out by the fact that deflation encourages saving and there'd like be a correspondingly larger pool of available bitcoin to loan out.
Also, 10% deflation a year would be far above what I would expect after adoption nears saturation. You'd expect deflation to roughly equal economic growth, say 3% or so. Most mainstream investments try to return at least 5% - 8%, at least that's what the market has been averaging long-term.

You're citing the intangibles that represent a psychic or social transaction cost. And you're completely right. Bitcoin isn't just more monetarily efficient, it's much more efficient time-wise.
Many transactions that currently take days, such as checks clearing or transfers, will be next-to instant with bitcoin.
And the larger the dollar figure, the more risky it is for banks, and the more work they do to make sure everything is legit.
With bitcoin, the size is irrelevant to risk. Either the transaction comes through with no attempted double-spends or it doesn't.

This is why they might welcome giving up that sector of their industry in order to obtain a higher ROI.

Orange looks surprisingly good. I still think it a bit too intense, but it's acceptable. Also, the hover-color is green now. Orange to green isn't wonderful. How about a light orange and then a darker orange for hover color.
As for the submit buttons, I think pick some other color and keep them the same color. They are the same category of thing, in a sense, and so a matching color should work. Checking other custom subreddits should give you an indication of where others have taken it.
How about a powder-blue color for them both. Is it possible to do a blend? Maybe make a blended button and reverse the blend on each button.
I suppose I can add one more thing, the up vote and down vote buttons and numbers, perhaps something other than the same dark gray as the link text. How about gold instead of green when I've voted; more in line with the bitcoin-logo color. Adds some unity to the design.

All that matters from the standpoint of the price is supply and demand. It doesn't matter if you can't distinguish it, if it's lost it can never enter the market again, and overall supply decreases by that much.


You're proposing essentially stealing coins people have in cold storage, and you're making me mad just saying it. There is ABSOLUTELY NO NEED to re-mine lost coins in the first place, because bitcoin can be made infinitely divisible.

If we accept the thesis that Roman rulers manipulated monetary policy primarily to the rulers' benefit to further their own rule, power, and wealth, and that this caused severe negative consequences on the citizenry, which the article points out many dire and progressive consequences over hundreds of years, then it's reasonable to suggest that using a currency they could not manipulate would have been to the benefit of the citizenry and foiled the arbitrary power and wealth of the Roman leadership and military apparatus.
It is not some general theory of history that I'm appealing to but rather a working knowledge of Austrian economic theory and the consequences of inflation on a society, which include economic dislocation, negative wealth growth, and disincentives towards private investment.

I think he was just saying they'd fork bitcoin and run their own version, not as a challenge to bitcoin necessarily. Maybe making their version legal and bitcoin illegal or something?
It would be a desperate move that had no ultimate effect on bitcoin, agreed, but my point is that bitcoin exists the way it does to support the fact of decentralized mining / transaction-confirmation.
If you're going to centralize transaction-processing there's literally no point in having a block-chain. Just use servers and a transaction tracking system and be done with it, much like Amazon coins and the like.

Medium safe. For one thing, you'd want to at least pull the power on the computer and printer to let the website and info drain out of memory so any potential virus couldn't hold onto it and transmit when the Wifi came back on. But generally it's not a good idea to trust cold storage wallet generation to a computer that's been used online before. Just too risky unless you're an amazing person on security.
Checkout for a stockhold of info on generating secure wallet addresses.
Like [this post]( or [this one]( 
Good luck! I just generated my first secure cold wallets a few days ago. I personally went out and bought a cheap laptop that had never been online before in order to generate them. Either do that or use the LiveCD method with Linux. Somehow you've got to be reasonably sure that there's no virus or keylogger on the system you generate them on, and a virgin install in among the few ways to obtain that.


Go to Block Explorer at a random address, say like [this one]( and replace the address in the URL with your address. If you put the wrong public address in there it will give you the "invalid address" notification. You can then copy this address to the program used to send bitcoin knowing it's a valid one if it goes through.
And then, to be safe, send a very small amount of bitcoin to this address, say 0.0001 btc and let it go through and confirm, etc., use Blockchain explorer again to view the completed transaction. Maybe even let it sit a few days to see if a thief takes it, just to be sure. Many will take an immediate amount found since they usually operate short-term.
If it sits pretty, transaction goes through, etc., you can be reasonably sure it's safe :) Hope that helps.

You're conflating negative and positive rights.
Rights are the sphere within which it would be wrong for anyone to stop you from acting. They cannot include such things like "right to basic necessities" and the like. Those would be demands on other people, not rights, more like privileges or welfare.


Not really. Need does not create a moral imperative. If someone is starving and needs food and I have a sandwich, I do not have a moral imperative to give them food because I am not responsible for them starving. I have an option to give them food, and probably will because I am also compassionate. But there is no moral imperative. I would be within my rights to keep my sandwich to myself, even if people considered that cruel ultimately.
Similarly, if I worked to produce productive capital, it is not wrong for me to retain possession of it, even land.


Lol, the usual socialist confusion over employment. Employment cannot be exploitative, it is voluntary and optional.
How's that been working out for the socialists in the places where they had no political opposition. Last I heard, soviet Russia was poor beyond belief, starving even--despite having the world's largest expanses of fertile cropland. 
Meanwhile, capitalistically run USA became breadbasket to the world. Guess your theory about exploitative employment didn't work out so well there, and it's not to the USSR that people kept trying to *defect*.
Ditto with Cuba, and now Venezuela's falling apart after only a few years of leadership under a near socialist dictator, all while having the world's largest oil supplies.
Yeah, that whole theory about exploitation is workin' out great. Keep with it.


Their own labor is their productive property, their body. 


Actually they're not being forced to sell to anyone. They can start their own company, or become a sole proprietorship--this is not illegal or impossible at all, and doesn't even take capital to start.
People choose to have a job and use an employer's productive capital because even while paying a percentage to the employer, they can make more money using the employer's productive capital to multiply their productivity than they could do so on their own without the productive capital.
It's actually a true win/win for both employer and employee and thus is the exact opposite of exploitation.




Nah, political freedoms are equal. You are conflating with economic "freedoms," where those who produce the most can also purchase the most. But they earned that wealth freely, it's only fair.


Rather if you produce nothing you may starve, yes, but you'd have to refuse to work utterly.


Course it is. Some people starve to death on purpose. However I haven't seen people starving in the streets in capitalist countries.
Meanwhile, socialist North Korea is full of people starving to death, especially children, so I think you aren't helping your case here.


But they do have a choice. A choice is exactly what they have. True tyranny is socialist countries where you literally couldn't choose NOT to work, you couldn't even choose what job you had.
You have some seriously twisted ideas, and I suggest you read more widely.

You should look into [Austrian economics]( ala Mises and Rothbard.
If you've only ever been fed the Keynesian line then I can understand why you feel distressed. However why did your teachers not even address Austrian economic theory.


This is what I'm talking about. All econ is not based on Keynes, only government econ is based on that, primarily because Keynes gave intellectual veneer to what governments already wanted to do anyway: inflate the money supply to their heart's content, which is the primary underlying cause of economic ills in the modern day.
Deflation is not necessarily bad for an economy at all. In fact it can be quite good, encouraging savings and thus leaving more money for investments.

I tell you as someone who has long studied economics, the cause of inflation is an increase in the money supply. 
Again, prices rising could also be caused by either increases in demand or decreases in supply of a good, in addition to inflation. But if you want to talk strictly inflation, it's caused by an increase in the money supply, and it's typically measured by tracking prices, even though price tracking is subject to the other factors I mentioned.


Not correct. Only changes in the quantity of money (supply), or demand for money (demand) can affect the purchasing power of money. Supply increasing creates inflation, demand increasing creates deflationary pressure.


Probably it's the fact that they set about nationalizing companies left and right.
All you need is this line from the article:


Devaluation means an increase in the money supply by one means or another. And the salary increase means the government is increasing the amount of dollars they print to pay people, which means printing way more money.

Not long-term, naturally.

Their margins may not be that thin, but their profit usually is. Sure markup may be 30-60% but that's net revenue, not profit. If their profit after expenses is a few percents they're likely to think they're doing well. Many businesses are delighted to make a 1% profit.
Many places are underwater all year long until christmas when they finally make a profit.
And it is precisely the small stores that are paying the 3-4% credit fees, and these also represent the vast majority of all businesses.
Remember the recent ruling that allowed stores to pass credit fees onto their customers? It used the same 3-4% figure for fees.

No... Gox could fold as a company, tying up your money for months or making it poof entirely. That's the worst that could happen. If customers abandon the company, if they can't work out these issues, it's even a likely scenario at this point.
Anytime a company starts having liquidity problems, no matter how they explain it, I would advise people to be extra cautious. When banks begin delaying cash-out, a bank run is imminent. But just because Gox is an exchange and has a track-record people are less scared by obvious trouble signs.
Signs that, hopefully, will resolve themselves in time, but signs that may also become seen as red-flags in hindsight should the situation go bad.

That's already happening, and driven in part by increasing market cap, price, and legitimacy. So buy and hold does in fact further that end! Think of buying and holding bitcoin as buying a tech stock.
You hold bitcoin because you think it has a future for w/e reason, perhaps you expect it eventually to replace national currencies. If you/we are correct, then the 'true' value of a bitcoin right now is extremely low.
I think people are buying based on their expectation of future rise in value of a bitcoin, not just because of speculation but because of expanding use. Every day there's news of some new company or thing using or taking bitcoin.

I agree, btw. At first I thought this was clearly bubble behavior, but further research and consideration seems to indicate this event as very different in character from the 2011 spike. If it does spike and drop I think it's likely to be far, far higher than $32 and to come back to some sane figure well above possibly even today's price, thus I feel fine buying today.
And if the price did plummet to $10, I'd still be perfectly happy, those losses would be reversed within a year's time I'm sure, and I'd be able to buy far more coins in the mean time, so I'd be happy to be wrong!

That's not what 100% reserve means.
Let me explain. Say we have 50% reserve. That would mean that for each bitcoin deposited by savers, the bank would loan out two bitcoins.
Say we had 33.33% reserves. For each bitcoin deposited by savers the bank would loan out 3 bitcoins.
Say we had 10% reserves. For each bitcoins deposited, the bank would loan out 10 bitcoins.
This is the meaning of reserve percentages.
100% reserve means the bank loans out no more than it has in deposits. It certainly does -not- mean that a bank cannot loan any money at all. Only that banks cannot inflate the money supply artificially and risk their solvency by creating loans with money they don't have.
Modern US banks -are- allowed to create money they don't have with a 10% reserve requirement as I listed above. If you deposit $1 in a US bank they can use that as the reserve to loan out $10.
This is why if there's a run on the bank they run out of cash to give you. And why nearly all banks are FDIC insured, so that they basically can't run out of cash. The Fed will print money to give away if needed. Whole thing's a giant sham actually. 
Since bitcoin can't be printed out of thin air, ever, you could still have fractional reserve banking, but it would be far riskier, and the only kind of insurance possible would be bank-pools, loaning each other funds if runs seemed to threaten them.
The fact that bitcoin practically forces a much higher reserve requirement will actually add sanity to the financial sector. Something like the '08 crash for instance would have been entirely prevented had Bitcoin been the nation's currency already.

You can purchase and send instantly, but when you send it might take 30 min for Coinbase's algorithm to actually broadcast the transaction to your outside wallet, so take that into account.
For instance, for a Bitpay purchase you've got 15 minutes to broadcast to the address they give you. I wouldn't use Coinbase to complete a Bitpay order. I'd use my own or a trusted web-wallet.

What's also interesting is that each country would have to buy in successively. So you'd get chunky jumps over time, omg, the market would go crazy, and as soon as that started happening the speculators would go absolutely mad trying to buy bitcoin before the next countries bought in. 
We'd see serious market exuberance that made the last bubble look like nothing :P We'd certainly see $1,000 before a crash to sanity again, unless further uptake was quickly forthcoming.

In ancient Iceland, which had something like a libertarian legal system, the courts had a rule that if you didn't come to court when you were sued for any reason, you from then on could never partake in the court system yourself--in short you became an outlaw, and all the courts in the country would black-ball you. Which meant you had zero legal recourse ever again and basically had to flee for your life.
So, in this case, the leecher comes to court for the same reasons and makes redress for property damage.
Even if he doesn't show, you can show objective harm to your property and the court can give you carte blanche to stop the leeching, to enter the other's property and stop the source of the leech. And if he then complains or tries to stop you that would be an aggression on his part.
Because what courts do is rule about whom gets to use force legitimately in the resolution of a dispute. And if he thinks the ruling wrong he can countersue.

Simple, you stop mining and the more efficient miners keep mining.
That's what's awesome about it, that it gives major financial incentive to be the most efficient miner in the world. The most efficient ones will likely always make money. It's the laggards on efficiency who will stop making money and be forced to drop out, increasing the overall efficiency of the network.
If and when mining a block produces dramatically fewer bitcoin it's expected that the number of transactions in that block tipping the miner will make up the difference.
The block reward is 25 btc right now, and the average tip aggregate right now, from what I've seen, is about 1 btc.
Now imagine 20 years from now. The tip aggregate for each block might be more like 5 btc, or 10 btc, or maybe more btc than the block reward!
Although mining produces fewer block rewards over time, as the number of transactions in each block increase the tips will begin to seriously add up.
I wonder when it will be that tips exceed the size of the block reward. Surely no time soon, but that will be a momentous occasion.

Yes, but I think they really misunderstand its character. Bitcoin is a product of individualist thinking, that is of libertarians. Bitcoin's governance is distributed *individualistically*, not collectively. That is, the miners make individual decisions as to what they'll accept, there is not the mechanism of democracy, a collectivist means, to force decisions on the whole. Rather they 'vote' by their actions, much like a marketplace, which is inherently individualist.


It was Marx's innovation to embrace the state into anarchism to create Marxism, to use the power of the state to achieve the anarchist objectives, the whole thing being recast as socialism.
While they talk of vanishing the state, it simply doesn't happen in practice.

Eh? Howso, in the sense of having missed the bus? That can't be true. Inflation is true theft from those holding value in the currency being inflated.
Saying that deflation is theft from people holding no deflationary currency at all is rather silly. When something gains value because demand increases for it, that is deflation, but that is not theft from those who don't own that thing.


That is as it should be. Economies should be allowed rapid and sharp downturns so as to minimize overall economic distortion and slough off unproductive businesses.

The public address is a hash of the private key. The private key is neither valid nor invalid, it just is. It doesn't have checkbits on it, it's just a certain length string of characters, and any string on that set can be turned into a valid public address.
So, if you generate a keypair and the public address works and was generated from the private key, it's a valid private key assuredly.
Want to be so sure that you spend from the private key securely at least once? Then get the Armory client and learn how to do offline-signed transactions. But I don't feel the need.

I'm guessing that the price of bitcoin will be around $200 or more in late 2016, and speculators will begin buying rapidly in the months that the block-reward halving approaches, remembering the runup in 2013.
The halving will come, mining will be very unprofitable again, as in 2013, miners will hold coins generated hoping the price will rise so they can be sold profitably later, and the price will again skyrocket, perhaps up to $1k or more, before again crashing, probably to around $500 this time, where it will  again level out.
Except that this time, the news will be bigger, everything will happen faster, and the recovery will be quicker, and the price will begin climbing again almost immediately this time, and people will look back wistfully on the $100 price we have today, wishing they'd bought in then, just like we look at the sub-pennies price now.

You're thinking in cash terms but missing the opportunity cost, again. You bought in Nov, you could've had ~15 bitcoin for $170. If you miner doesn't earn you more than 15 bitcoin then you've lost out.

Actually I consider that one of the first likely big victories. The OPEC nations have no attachment to the dollar, and would like to get rid of it, but the Euro is in crisis and they don't trust the Chinese.
They'd also love to stick their thumb in the US's eye. Thus, begin pricing in bitcoin once the market-cap gets big enough.
Leave it to someone like Hugo Chavez to start it off, etc.
That will lead to complete victory, because the whole world will be forced to sit up and take notice, and then buy bitcoin if they want oil.

A private key is produced by an algorithm first. This is then hashed to produce the public address associated with that private key in deterministic fashion.

Avalon is shipping. TODAY. KNC is quite likely to ship. Of course no one expects much out of BFL, but they're shipping slowly now too.


What if I sold you an investment that always lost money? You wouldn't be upset. The people buying these miners think they're gonna make something and they're not likely to at all. They'd be much better off buying bitcoin outright.
How is that a cool thing to do? If every ASIC company did that, mining would be dead.
Besides, if they want to sell to future customers, repeat business, why are they burning these customers on ROI? 
If AM starts selling larger, more expensive mining gear at an inflated price, they'll probably get buyers for that too, but they're not gonna make much money doing it.
I tell you AM would make far more money selling the USB sticks at a reasonable price that doesn't price all profit out of them, because they'd likely sell far more of them. Eventually, at the current price, they're gonna run out of rubes.
They already ran out of dupes at the 2BTC price, won't be long at 1BTC, they'll probably half it again at that point.


Not every ASIC producers is BFuckingL. Avalon is shipping. KNC is likely to ship.
Are you suggesting people are buying USB miners at a loss because other ASIC companies have made it hard to get ASICs?
Listen, there's only one reason to buy one of these USB miners, and that's if you're in a region where buying bitcoin is literally impossible, because that way you can convert fiat to bitcoin, via mining, but you're gonna take a roughly 33% hit in value!
Rip. Off.

Basically the transaction that makes it into a mined-block first would be considered the 'real' one because it gets added to the blockchain, and the other would fail because of this, and be detected as a double-spend attempt.
This is because when you spend out of an address you actually send -all- of the btc in an address to the receiving address and then get back the rest as 'change', so it's not possible to spend from one wallet twice in the same moment like that.

Whichever the disputants decide upon. 


Then you hire a 3rd court and the majority opinion wins.


It's not multiple overlapping jurisdictions--it's every person has 100% jurisdiction over themself, and the overlappingness is what laws people in those areas accept. Which isn't jurisdiction at all, just law.


Yes, and that legal authority should be *the individual*, not some politician. And the territory of the individual is himself and his property and nothing else.


Laws are fine, it's the part where they're forced on people that there's a problem. Everyone should accept their own law-set and both live by it and be prosecuted by it if need be.

It may seem a radical concept, however it is true. Suggest you read up on ["Ethics of Liberty"]( by Rothbard. 
It must be realized that democracy is inherently collectivist. What democracy does it legitimize the idea that some people can force other people to accept a certain policy. That is, these people can force the losers of a vote to accept what the majority wants.
This is clearly a use of force, an aggression in fact.
Say I have $100. A thief comes and takes $50 of it. Everyone agrees that's aggression. But let's say I earn $100 and the majority has decided to tax all income by 50%. Even if I vote against this, I have lost $50, equally against my will, and by the same use of force.
This is to say that there's nothing magical about the will of the majority that can turn an unethical action into an ethical action.


So now noodles will become cheaper, allowing more people to afford them, and the standard of living will rise. Meanwhile the workers displaced will go on to more productive jobs. What's the problem? You act as if there's a finite amount of work to be done in the world, there isn't. What's important to advance society is to keep doing more and more productive work, not simply to have everyone employed. Freeing up people from less productive manual labor into knowledge-working jobs (which robots cannot do) is a net boon to society and improves everyone's standard of living together.


I could only take this statement seriously if there existed some class of people who were only capable of cutting noodles for a living.


It is the fallacy on neo-luddites to assume mechanization is eliminating jobs. Example. When the phone company still used operators to make phone calls, peope would call in, tell the operator what number they wanted, and the operator would manually switch the circuits to connect them.
Then the telephone companies introduced electric switchboards that didn't require operators.
Did this suddenly put every operator out of business? No. Though the operators were ready to strike over it. But the use of the telephone increased so much that all those people were rehired as 'dial zero' operators, and even more were hired in fact.
To the point that the phone company years later said, if you were going to try to go back to the system of manual switching that it would take every woman in north -and- south america, including babes in arms, and you still wouldn't have enough.
Did mechanizing the telephone cost us jobs? Or did it dramatically improve the standard of living. did mechanizing the automobile factories cost us jobs? Sure. But now we do far more productive work: designing and investing rather than making.


But it will have been a problem created by out of control government, not capitalism. ie: government-failure. And your solution will be for the new government to take over everything (until true socialism arrives and government goes away which will never actually happen)?


Does that sound voluntary to you? I said a voluntary society. That sounds like you're attacking people against their will. You would be arrested, tried, and convicted of violating another's property.


No, you don't. Because my own law for my property would be no murder, no physical harm, no theft, and I would live by it, and if you're visiting my property you'd agree to live by it. So if you tried it you'd be breaking the law, be subdued and tried and convicted, just like here.
But that's quite an imagination you have, if completely wrong in its every assumption.


We have a way already: agreement and contract. This is how private people create rules about their association. This is voluntary.


Yes, it's called law and contract, and we covered that.

But people are not robots governed by equations, they're reacting to things in the real world. So what drives a higher v or lower q? Inflation or expectations of inflation drive a higher v, as people try to escape expected inflation with flight into commodities of any sort.

Similarly, lower q can be driven by economic turmoil and uncertainty--prices rising would normally be a production signal, indicating higher demand, but businesses learn to mistrust that signal in an inflationary economy, because to bet wrongly means to risk bankruptcy or significant financial damage via overproduction. Thus companies underproduce out of financial defense. So which came first, the inflation via money supply, or these  reactions to expected inflation driving similarly inflationary activity? Without the expectation of inflation via the supply of money being increased, it's possible these other two may not occur. When in doubt, bet on inflation, seems to be the safest course.


I admit you're right. Initially I had ignored the demand side in replying, but mentioned it in later comments. It's just that, viewing demand for money as a functional of individual marginal utility of money means that demand for money is only going to drop if money is already inflating.
And the only thing that can cause money to inflate in the first place, as well as the resultant higher v and lower q, as I point out, is printing it. 
Higher v is a direct result of printed money, as the greater amount of money in circulation results in a higher v quite naturally. That's often the admitted point of printing money to produce higher v. And lower q if not always caused by inflation, but rather bubbles in the business cycle, can be viewed as distortions in industry caused by printed money creating bubbles that need to periodically pop.
Money is the most liquid good in any economy. Why on earth would anyone demand it less, without reason. And that reason is inflation itself, which can only come from printing initially.
This is is it not? Does anyone imagine that bitcoin will ever be found to be inflationary after the last bitcoin is mined? Not a chance. Even now, at a controlled inflation rate, it's still long-trend deflationary.
What do you think.

You still protect rights with police and courts, the question is how you establish rights in the first place, and the answer is by who owns what property and by agreement thereby.
Say you own a house, you would set the laws for the house. Thus your rights are protected on your land, the rights you choose.
If someone visits, they must accept your law-set to enter the property. If there's a dispute or a rights violation as set forth in your laws, then you call the police and take them court for redress.
But they agreed to your law-set before setting foot on your property.
If they don't agree, they don't enter your land.
Similarly, if you want to use another's property, such as private roads or shopping centers, you would see the laws of that property and agree to it, or not, and thus have total control over your own legal circumstances, and also have rights protection in everything you do.
In practice, people would have very similar regional law codes to make it convenient for people, so it would be quite similar to how things are now, at least in terms of regional legal differences, police and courts still enforcing local law, etc.
So no, it doesn't assume everyone's ethical or wise.
Let's say Joe is an idiot and makes a law saying it's okay to murder anyone.
Fine, but this law will only apply to him and anyone else on his land.
Seeing this law, no one will agree to set foot on his land. No one's that dumb. So he will never have opportunity to actually kill anyone.
Meanwhile, word gets out that it's legal to murder Joe on his own property, since he has made murder legal there.
So, no one but Joe is at risk from this law. Joe can be legally murdered 24/7 on his own property, but has no opportunity to kill anyone else. And the second he sets foot off his own land he's now living by someone else's law-set, and cannot murder anyone.
So, at worst, Joe would be the one harmed by his own dumb law and no one else.
No one will protect your own rights better than you. You always know when you're being abused. Under this system you don't have to trust any 3rd party to recognize your rights. You have full control of what you do or don't accept.

That's an easy assumption to make, but that's not what's going on. If the price were going down they'd be doing the same thing; their system uses an *expert system* to rate the safety of bank-drafts, since these are reversible and they operate on a 1% margin they have to err on the side of caution.
The expert system is estimated to be 80-90% accurate, but errs, as we said, on the side of caution to protect their company.

It's predictable within certainly reasonable limits.
Even if BFL ships, they'd get two weeks of mining in before the difficulty adjusts upwards to account for it. That might mean a few tens of thousands more bitcoin than would have been otherwise generated, not hundreds of thousands, certainly not millions.
What would they do then, stop mining for 2 weeks, let the difficulty go down again, then mine like crazy again? That would be silly.

You're right, and he'd be free to not show up. But that doesn't mean a judgment wouldn't be entered against him. Plus in ancient Iceland where a similar legal system existed the courts had a defense against people who didn't show up to court: blacklisting.
If you were sued and didn't come to court, you were now an outlaw and lost the right to ever use the court-system again. You could even be killed without legal recourse. So people always came to court.


Yes, if he wanted to live there in exile for the rest of his life. But if the court handed down a property judgment against him, people could come seize his property rightfully, and his only recourse would be to countersue them.


If he had a judgment against him then they'd have right to take his property to satisfy the judgment. A judgment gives the ethical right to use force to satisfy a judgment of who's at fault for harm. If he resisted this it would be a new aggression and he'd get sued again.


There's a doctrine called 'coming to the nuisance.' If loud music was the guy's habit and he's there first, anyone moving next to him would be unable to complain. If he came after everyone else and tried it, he'd be sued rightly. He'd probably end up paying the neighborhood for doing in ultimately or just move to a party-town that doesn't care.
As for poison gas, that would be an outright tort, and he'd by physically damaging people's property not to mention causing assaults all over the place. He'd be invaded quickly to stop that.

That's not how economics works though. 
We don't have savings merely because someone can print dollar bills at will.
We have savings because we are producing more than we consume, individually.
You say that other person gave us that 1btc, that's true, but they did so as part of their consumption of services that we produced, and they may be saving on top of their consumption at the same time that they gave us 1 btc.
Wealth comes from production, not from the amount of money in an economy.
So if demand and price keeps going up and inflation continues, the simple answer is that people will save in smaller increments of btc. 
You think there's a fixed amount of bitcoin--this is true, but bitcoin can hold an essentially infinite amount of *value* in it, via a floating price.
10 years after my example, the price of bitcoin may rise such that people are spending .9 bitcoin a month and saving .1 bitcoin, although the purchasing power remains the same as 10 years prior.
Which means there's 10 times more bitcoin out there serving the same amount of purchasing power. That's one way to look at it.
Savings is not dependent on a non-fixed supply of money, at all. It's dependent on producing more than you consume. The unit of account can be fixed just fine.

Naturally, and the govs know that, they also know that they cannot legislate bitcoin out of existence, as that would create a black market and have many negative effects for them as well.
They will choose the poison pill route--to make bitcoin comply with laws, they will slow it down via regulation, try to make it more annoying to use than the dollar.
This tactic has worked on many previous technologies and things. They know they can't stop bitcoin anymore than they can stop bittorrent or TOR.
But you and I both know, or at least strongly suspect, that their attempts to regulate bitcoin will ultimately fail and bitcoin will be triumphant.

The most likely scenario of duplicate key generation is from using the same brainwallet seed to generate an address, and indeed many people have lost coins that way through using weak passphrase-seeds.
Famously someone made a brainwallet using the phrase 'sausage,' probably as a test, and lost a small amount.
Furthermore we should expect that weak password abritrageurs will be continually scanning brainwallet seeds for as long as bitcoin exists hoping to hit the jackpot from someone-else's stupidity.


To address this directly, you can keep your wallet encrypted with a good passphrase, and only use your private key on an air-gapped PC, for instance by using the Armory client which can generate offline transactions that can be taken to another PC and broadcast on the internet such that the private key doesn't exist on an internet-connected PC.

If we're lucky, bitcoin will break government monopolies on the patronage of their citizens and allow citizens choice in government.
I think what we need in governance is to explore what it would mean to inject the individualist-ethic into governance, supplanting the socialist-ethic.
The socialist-ethic says that the group is more important than the individual, and the individual must give way to the group. This is perfectly in line with democracy, which uses the majority vote to force policies on those whom dissent. It is right because the group decides it is right is what democracy means.
The founders of the US knew this was a problem, that democracies have always descended into tyranny, so they tried to balance majority rule with minority rights, using enumerated powers that go largely ignored today, and a bill of rights that is always largely ignored.
Either the constitution was designed to let the government get as big and powerful as it is today, or it has been unable to stop it. Either is an indictment against continuing this experiment.
If we had a political system marked by individualism rather than socialism, it would mean that there could be no jurisdictional monopolies.
I envision each individual not voting for laws, but literally crowd-sourcing them, writing or adopting the laws that they personally want to live by, and applying that law-set to their own property. The locus of control over which laws you live by would move from the social group (democracy) to the individual (you).
And people who agree in the main on legal principles would group together and form societies of legal agreement. Which means everyone would get their way and no one has been forced by anyone. 
If you visit another's property, they would inform you as to the rule-set and you may enter only if you agree, and vice versa.
The result would be lots of political experimentation but it would in time settle into stable communities.
In these communities, marked by individualism, there would be no government at all. There would instead be security providing companies (police), and dispute resolution companies (courts) that take fee for service.
If the community wanted something done, they would contribute to its accomplishment not by taxation, but by voluntary subscription. That will be the only way to finance something in a world where bitcoin exists and cannot be controlled by a government or seized at whim for non-payment.
Say the community wants a bridge built, they organize all interested parties, form a corporation, and sell shares in the bridge to all parties in exchange for voluntary monthly subscriptions to get it done, shares being proportional to money spent. 
When the bridge is done, they become the new owners of the bridge and share in the proceeds and can sell their share at whim.
It's a very different way of building a society, but I think it would be a hundred times more interesting and less frustrating.

Debateable. The amount of debt we have right now virtually requires 0% interest rates. If they go up much the US can't even service the interest.
So they will print money to pay it.
Hello double-digit inflation is the end result of that train.


The US faces risks with that strategy that others don't, because it's a reserve currency.
If it pursues that strategy it risks losing its reserve status, since it's causing real value loss in those central banks that hold dollars, and they'll pressure the US not to print to massive extent or face a dollar dump.
If those holding reserves begin dumping dollars, and those holding US debt begin dumping debt and demanding repayment, it could be a perfect storm and the dollar could very well end up repudiated. And it could happen sooner rather than later.

Because Bitcoin is the most perfect form of money that humankind had ever created or used. It's a digital native that doesn't rely on any central authority or 3rd-party trust for its value store.
Are there going to be more digital purchase in the future, or less?
It cannot be controlled or inflated by any central power, and thus its value cannot be destroyed by inflation like every other currency in the world. Even gold's value could be destroyed if we one day found huge gold deposits (in asteroids maybe?).
Bitcoin's market cap is still in its infancy, some $340 million. Two months ago it had just broken $200m.
For Bitcoin to see further adoption, the market cap will have to increase by many orders of magnitude, thus investing now puts you in on the ground-floor.
Figuring out the promise of Bitcoin, if the whole world were to switch to bitcoin, one bitcoin would be worth $3 million in today's money. So, you're buying into what may be the world's greatest investment of all time. It would be like buying gold before people knew gold was good for money and it was water-cheap.
On a more realistic level, within our lifetime Bitcoin is estimated to end up at some $55,000 per bitcoin within a few decades, a more conservative estimate.
Apart from the promise of bitcoin, talk of a global currency war could drive users into bitcoin to escape government mismanagement of their own national currencies. I'm sure residents of Argentina, Venezuela, etc., would have loved to escape into bitcoin before their devaluations took place.
I'll mention one more amazing possibility, and that's if the dollar begins to falter and lose confidence, which it's already starting to do. We know the OPEC nations would love to stop pricing oil in dollars. I can see a future where they price oil in bitcoin.
But the market cap of bitcoin must be far, far higher before that can happen, at least $100 billion I'd say. At that market-cap, one bitcoin would be worth $6,000+ dollars, and pricing oil in bitcoin would probably multiply the market cap by a factor of 10 to account for new demand, and that would send bitcoin mainstream, leading to economies around the world beginning to use it natively, resulting in potentially a world-wide takeover of all finance by bitcoin.
It may prove to be the greatest investment opportunity that has ever existed.
Most of us missed the Apple / Microsoft / Google train, this makes those opportunities look cute by comparison.
It's not a question of whether bitcoin will take over the world, it's when will that happen, and which bitcoin will achieve it, this one or a successor? Probably this one, as it has massive momentum, but the risk is that the powers that be may attempt to block bitcoin somehow, as they'd lose much wealth and prestige if it takes over.
But likely they will fail and the result will be a financial revolution that changes the world.

The transaction costs are technological. You can transmit value directly with bitcoin. With any credit purchase that's not possible, there always needs to be corresponding action behind the scenes along a chain of trust, that both slows things down and creates chargeback potential, because no one wants to get left holding the bag if it's fraudulent.

You can send a message to someone by sending bitcoin to them, embedding a message in the transaction.
As part of the message, give him an email and have him send a new wallet address to you and have the message signed with the original key so you know it's him. 
You can use QT to verify any message signed with keys like that.

It's easy to understand. Anything that happens between consenting adults is no one else's business. Especially not the government.
We understand that easily when it comes to sex, but it's equally true in the economic realm.
No economic transaction will ever happen unless both parties to the transaction think they will be better off after the transaction occurs than they are before it. If they don't believe that, the transaction doesn't occur.
Thus every voluntary transaction stopped by government, including drug sales, is unethical. Just as unethical as stopping gay people from being together would be, or interracial couples.
It's your money, your body, your property, and therefore yours to do with as you like, and no one, not even the government, has the right or can have the right to stop you.
No one.

Buyers can more easily make it impossible to find them, and with bitcoin chargebacks are no longer possible. Adapt or die.
Also, constraining this question to a $40 charge is illegitimate. Similarly, only under our current bloated and ridiculous court system is $40 not worth pursuing. Under a leaner court system it's possible a $40 charge would be worth pursuing, if say it cost a few dollars and a few minutes to adjudicate.
Such would take 20th century court tech, and our courts are stuck in the 19th century.

Using a separate computer is the best way to achieve bitcoin security. For instance, many have setup Armory client on an old laptop that's never used online, and by this they can create transactions on an online computer, sign the transaction using the Armory offline computer (ferrying it via USB-stick), then broadcast the signed transaction using the online computer.
This is difficult and expensive to setup and yada, yada.
But this device is like buying that exact setup, ready to go. It's a separate computer that signs transactions. Just being connected via USB doesn't mean it's vulnerable. This is just a communication port, it doesn't need to interact with the connected computer except to listen for a transaction and then sign it if you press its buttons.

Money taken from you by force against your will, regardless of who is doing it, constitutes theft. 
I dare you to define taxation in a way that doesn't equate to theft and then you can call it absurd.


Are you saying governments have a right to my money? Am I a slave? Or that I have an obligation to give money to the government? When did I agree to that? If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and I withdraw my consent, then they have no just power over me, only unjust power. And taxation is therefore unjust, for I do not consent to it.


How does anything get built? People want it done and they do it. You know there was a time when roads, schools and fire stations were built without the help of government at all. They were private services. They will be again.


Voluntary donations or subscriptions from users, insurance policies (ie: fire), purchases (school services), monthly usage subscription (roads), etc.

Yes. You can have many addresses, regardless of service.




No, the fact that only you know the private key, or that online wallet service ties your password cryptographically to your private key for you.

Part 2:


There's no voting in a courtroom.


Not at all. If the whole community is on my property, then I guess this would be true. But it's more a scenario of each property owner being a dictator over only their own property. Which is not what a dictatorship means at all. In a dictatorship, the dictator commands not only his own, but also everyone else's property.
Instead we call it simply private ownership and control. One owns their own property and has complete control over it and no one else's. End of story.


Think of laws as applying geographically rather than broadly, or applying only within property boundaries. You go to your friend's house, he has a law that all people inside must take their shoes off. You leave his house that's not the law at his neighbor's house. Capiche?
There are no 'citywide' laws that apply to everyone equally. It is possible for the whole city to have accepted the same law, then you could say X law applied within this entire city, however that would be individually decided, not forced by the collective.


I never said I was fine with it. I compared it to autarchy and said it can produce the same result via a different means. Consensus decision making is collective decision making. Autarchy produces individual decision making on individual property and no further. 


Because when someone makes a decision for you, that is tyranny. Direct democracy substitutes the will of the collective for the will of the individual, forcing the collective's decision on the individuals whether they want it or not, and this is wholly unethical and evil.


No they don't. Each individual gets a tiny fraction of a % of say. The collective decides for them. What happens if they disagree with the decision of the collective? Tough luck.


They get everything they want under my system. So you must be wrong.


In my society, you don't need anyone else's permission to accept a law. You simply accept it. It is far superior to your idea of direct democracy where you need the collective's permission to change your legal circumstances.


Except in direct democracy you have to leave the society, including your own property. In my idea you can start a new society in place without leaving your own property. Far better.


Whether you're using consensus or majority rules doesn't change the fact that you're still pushing aside the will of the individual for that of the majority. Sure in a 100% consensus anyone can veto any idea, but not anyone can get any idea accepted, such as in my proposal. So it's entirely different. In my idea each person can both veto and force any law on themselves and themselves only.


Exactly. Which is completely dumb.


We shall see.


False. Everyone on X land is subject to the same law-set. You seem to still fundamentally misunderstand the idea if you can say this.


Imagine if each property boundary were "it's own society." That's close to what I propose. There is one set of laws on each property. If someone's inside those property boundaries they've agreed to abide by those laws. Thus you always know what laws everyone's under, because if you're there you're under the same law-set.

Think about it like this, between 0.007% - 0.029% of humanity own any bitcoin whatsoever (depending on whose estimate you accept).
But the time will soon come when everyone will want them because they will be as good as gold for transacting online.
The value of bitcoin is demand driven. Very, very few people have even heard of bitcoin, much less researched it enough to accept, trust, and invest in it.
So when companies all over the internet begin accepting it, and mainstream trust quickly follows, demand will suddenly skyrocket, and the price along with it.
**So what service are we performing by investing in it now? We're giving bitcoin the market cap it needs to achieve legitimacy and mainstream adoption. We're doing humanity a huge favor: launching a global financial revolution.**
Think about this, the OPEC nations would love to stop pricing oil in dollars, but they don't trust the Chinese and the Euro is in the dumps.

This model you lay out here is ridiculous dude.
You've got two people who are consuming the exact amount of work that they produce--so of course no one is saving anything.
How many times do I have to say that savings is equal to that which you produced but do NOT consume.
So if A produces 9 btc a week and consumers 9 btc a week, of course he'll have no savings. Similarly for B. Your simplistic model assumes both of them are exactly consuming what they produce so they can't save--that's exactly right.
You can save only when you produce more than you consume.

Well you're right that my statement is not a very precise one for what I was trying to communicate. In essence, everything of value is scarce. That's what my statement boils down to and it's not exactly a keen statement in any way. But neither is it absurd. Only things as ubiquitous as air, rocks, and ocean-water have a price of 'free' where supply outstrips demand forever, and even those have special cases where they're sold all the same after value-added processing.
The difference is, most things you can simply produce more of, but with bitcoin you cannot. You could go produce a mountain of diamonds tomorrow, DeBeers has them in storage, and reduce the price of diamonds to $1 a carat, but you cannot do that with bitcoin. And since bitcoin is acting as a currency, it's even more a special case, where everyone will demand it since it can be traded freely for anything.
What I was trying to write against, by saying that, is the trope of inflationists who have often in history said things like 'the supply of money is too low' as an argument for further inflating.
A currency never has a supply problem unless it is deflating to the point that there's not enough subdivisibility to complete small contracts. This was a problem in ancient coinage money systems, it is not a problem today with bitcoin.


It still stabilizes on a price, but if demand continues to increase and supply remains essentially constant, the price will and must rise. Every bitcoin price is made up of several components. There's its value as a medium of exchange, value as a curio or novelty, value as something that allows greater privacy, value as a speculatory object, confidence as a system, etc.
Some of these fluctuate considerably and evolve over time in reaction to other people's actions, ie: if lots of people are trusting the system others are more likely to also trust it.


Bitcoin is not a stock. It's a currency--the rules are a bit different. Using a purely investment lens to view it won't capture the whole picture.

Movement to gold can actually be a step towards bitcoin. Any rejection of fiat qualifies. Because once you have gold you might liquidate it into bitcoin, digital gold. And because any large-scale value movement out of fiat hurts fiat currencies and thereby decreases confidence in them, also helping bitcoin.
And if they fail in their attempt and get slammed, that too will help bitcoin somewhat, because they could've avoided it all by being in bitcoin.
Bitcoin keeps being the solution to so many problems--eventually people will realize this and trickle in, and trickles become floods.

Way I see it, they'll collect the asteroid to be mined, choosing a heavy-metals one, draw it into first moon orbit where they'll outfit it with a heat shield and guidance systems, then earth orbit where they'll do a controlled re-entry somehow. Over land or water? Hard to imagine. Maybe they'll cut it up in moon orbit and send chunks for re-entry.
Once on earth they'll smelt it. Separated into bands or not, they'll smelt it into individual metals easily enough. That's not difficult on land. 
Of course, such metals about about a million times more valuable already in space. And the logistics and dangers of bringing asteroids back in via re-entry means it'll probably rarely or never be tried.

But a currency does, via the network effect.

Not exactly. Computing power has a cost and people convert computing power into bitcoin via mining, thus bitcoin is a result of productive use of a computer that could be turned to other applications were it not used on bitcoin, and computing cycles are scarce, but that doesn't explain why people value bitcoin.
People value bitcoin because of its intrinsic property as a medium of exchange which are better than all other forms of money in certain situations.
If you want to transact anything online as a seller or buyer, bitcoin offers the lowest transaction costs and risk of any other means of exchange. It's generally faster (bank drafts take days), cheaper (send any amount for pennies), and less risky (no chargebacks), and also more private than any other means.
People generally value anything that saves them money, is faster, more secure, and more private.
That's why bitcoin has value. And because we all expect digital transactions to become the norm in the future, even for in-person and in-store sales (basically these are already digital and facilitated online through credit processors Visa/MC) then we expect Bitcoin to spread rapidly through all online retailers.
As more people use and become aware of it, its price will rise due to supply and demand. Bitcoin's strictly limited supply means prices will reflect changes in demand almost exclusively.
Except when the block-reward halves ever ~4 years, then you'll get a huge price surge due to halved supply that won't be entirely made up for by people selling their saved bitcoins (this we experienced the last three months or so).
So bitcoin, it's value is primarily derived from its function as a digitally native currency, which allows it to have a radically different cost structure when transacting online, which makes it the cheapest and best form of online medium of exchange that has ever been used or created.
Not sure how you boil that down into an elevator speech, but that should give you something to work off of :)

You can. Gold is not as rare as we believe it to be.
Asteroid mining is coming, and chances are there's many multiples of gold in those asteroids, especially since terrestrial gold is all thought to have come from asteroid strikes.
Gold's prices is destined to fall.
Compare that to bitcoin. 21 million is a universal constant, not a local one as is the availability of gold.
Your point on finding a flaw in bitcoin is a good one, but anyone who finds it will earn millions. And they could've done so years ago. Furthermore the protocol is a moving target with active development on-going. Find a flaw and it may be patched tomorrow, the blockchain losing perhaps a day of transactions at worst, who knows.

True enough, and I think blindsiding is the likely scenario if bitcoin adoption happens fast enough.
If it doesn't, they are in a position to be threatened by it and thus have huge incentive to study and learn about it, and may be able to adapt fast enough to craft a new business-model around bitcoin that plays to their existing infrastructure.
In any case, they can profit off of bitcoin and worldwide currency-exchange and transfer needs as long as bitcoin *isn't* the unit of account.
If and when it becomes so, they're essentially unneeded. But that could be decades.
If they do take up the bitcoin mantle they'd drive bitcoin adoption, ironically speeding up the eventual demise of their core business-model, but that would give them profits in the meantime and be good for the world.
If I were an MBA looking for a bitcoin-related opportunity it would be smart to try to get in at Western Union, et al., and push for a bitcoin-pilot program. That would be quite an experiment.

Hmm, a lot of it depends on your local energy costs. From there, it'd make sense to do due diligence on when you can expect to break even and go from there.

I wish I'd been mining two years ago, what makes it risky today is the rush into ASICs and you never know how much hashing ability is going to be out there. But I think you're likely to make back your investment within 2 years, just a question of whether that's going to be worth it compared to simply buying bitcoins right now. If bitcoin triples in two years and you only break even in two years, you're not ahead.

True, so where is the overall trend, into bitcoin, or into dollars?
Obviously it's into bitcoin or else the price would be dropping instead of rising. People may have to transfer back into dollars but may wish they didn't, to do things like pay bills or cover emergency spending.

One, when bitcoin becomes the unit of account in an economy, its deflationary nature no longer becomes nearly as apparent as when you're pricing things in dollars (that are themselves shaky and inflating) and that also implies a mature bitcoin valuation that will be both much higher and thus much more stable.
Secondly, the effect on investment is that marginally productive investments, such as the one proposed here, would be overlooked by the market in favor of ones significantly more productive. This would actually be a positive, focusing investment money into the most productive hands and plans.
Lastly, a deflationary currency encourages savings which means the previous effect would be offset by there being much more investment money available due to higher savings rates. We might see multiples more savings generally. Which would be a very positive thing for an economy indeed.

It's hard to call it truly stateless, rather than saying that it makes a state out of each person.

True, but let's assume it's close to feasible one day.
Trying to break an address that someone has the keys to means you could spend months or years trying to break it only to be foiled by them regularly moving the money around to new addresses, causing you to have to start from scratch.
But suppose that this dead address eventually accumulates a good amount of value for w/e reason, or that the price of BTC goes up high enough to make cracking it a target with new tech.
At the least you have the assurance that no one can move the money in it at whim. And secondly, actually pulling it off would be a signal to everyone on the network that the security has been broken.
Maybe you're right. If anyone could actually pull it off, they'd be much better off targeting a large address that's been in cold-storage for a long time and thus unlikely to be moved before the attack is successful.

No, most people gamble just for fun and never experience life-destroying results. It's like you're claiming that everyone who drinks alcohol inevitably ends up in a car wreck.
By far most people who gamble don't become addicted and do so for entertainment.


That's like saying the gun makers are profiting off murder, or alcohol makers profiting off DUI. You've chosen only the negative aspect, ignoring what most people get from it that is perfectly fine.


Gambling doesn't cause it direclty, these people being unable to control themselves leads to it. Wanna talk suicide, crime, bankruptcy, etc., **marriage** is a bigger source of these ills than gambling. Outlaw marriage?


All I care about is that each individual be allowed to decide for themselves. I'm pushing back against your decision to decide for people that they cannot gamble.

One can only create law over that property which they have ownership of. So such a law would be contradictory to the fact of ownership.
Since other people would claim their control of their own land, any attempt by you to take it creates a conflict. The police are called and a dispute-resolution organization: ie a court, is involved to settle the dispute. 
The court recognizes my right to the land, invalidates your baseless claim to my land, and orders you to make restitution for the illegitimate invasion of my property in an attempt to take it over in accord with your illegitimate law.
Case closed.


It's not supra-individual, it's a private court, and it does so on the basis of universal ethics.
People seem to think ethics are determined by law, but they aren't. We don't create ethical principles, we discover them. The fact of ownership is one such discovery, and when laws have accorded with good ethical principles, societies have done well.


Only in your imagination. In fact, I think it would end up being the most peaceful society ever created, because it would respect everyone's property rights. A society absent aggression whatsoever.

What's exciting is the apparent price disagreement. One minute someone's selling, the next buying. Usually the moves are more coordinated in one direction. This is more like a serious difference of opinion by multiple parties--or is it?

The price of bitcoin is demand driven. If price is a function of supply and demand and bitcoin is supply limited, then demand represents the total price.
Now, demand is influenced by several factors, not the least of which are expectations of future value and present demand.
So price of bitcoin is going up as people pay wealth into the system in exchange for bitcoins, this locks those coins into someone's wallet at the current high price, meaning they aren't likely to sell any time soon as their gains would be low.
At the same time you've got people with large caches of bitcoins which they obtained at much lower prices being continually tempted to lock in 1,000% gains and higher by selling now.
Whether the price spikes then is determined by the relative interplay of supply and demand of existing coins and buyers and is almost impossible to forecast accurately.
If everyone tried to sell tomorrow, it would be the same as saying that bitcoin has virtually no value and people don't see a future in it, so that price would melt away.
But imagine if tomorrow everyone decided bitcoin was too promising to ever sell even one of them, and people wanting to buy found almost no sellers, and the only sellers willing to sell wanted ludicrous dollar figures for one bitcoin, say $500 per. If the would-be buyers of bitcoin were actually willing to pay that price and sustain it, then market cap would explode. 
But if that happened, everyone holding coins would be really tempted to cash out, unless they too thought a bitcoin was worth more than $500 to them. Thus the price would stabilize according to where people think, on average, it has worth.
And I think it's that phenomena you're wondering about, how can it just gain market cap like that? It's because price is demand driven, and demand can build or fall on a whole host of considerations.
Most of us think bitcoin is poised to explode on the international scene and really just gathering strength right now, so the price is exploding.
Beyond that, lots of new people are being introduced to bitcoin and they're in a honeymoon period where they have bought their first coins and really have no interest in selling.
So the price of bitcoin reflects the overall optimism and confidence in the bitcoin network and idea generally.
As one article wrote, bitcoin is not an alternate currency so much as it is a tech stock. It's a bit that the future of ecommerce worldwide will eventually be conducted in bitcoin, and at that point one bitcoin will be many multiples in value, one estimated that it may rise as high at $55,000 per bitcoin.
If you believe that, it's time to buy and hold at -any- price. And that seems to be what people are doing as the price keeps rising :)

No, they'de have to do a certain amount of backwards-looking work initially, then 'reveal' their blockchain as longer than the current one, and clients would begin validating their blockchain and reversing transactions on the legitimate one.
Any attacker essentially has to re-compute a lot of the work that's already been done on the existing blockchain.
How do you move bitcoin that was entered into the blockchain 4 years ago? You don't, you can't, unless you go back there and recompute all that from scratch. Four years of blockchain computations.
No one, not even a government, is going to be able to achieve that today.
And every year that's not being done is just burying an attacker under the amount of work they'd have to do to try it.
Shorter attacks going back only a few blocks would be relatively easy to patch out in the face of overwhelming hashing power even. What would take them days of hashing could be invalidated in mere minutes with a patch. So once again we have an asynchronous and hyper-effective weapon against them.


If the attacker really wanted to sow havoc, he'd set us against ourselves. Most of us would defend the real blockchain because we like having our money where it is. 
But imagine if the attacker started a new blockchain and the effect of the new blockchain was actually to *move most bitcoin in a few large hasher's wallets*? Like AsicMiner and BTCguild and a few others.
Question is, could they get AM and BTCG to support their blockchain-takeover bid out of pure greed.
Probably not. AM and BTCG and the others would not want to risk damaging the credibility of their existing claim just for more BTC, plus most of us are honorable in any case.

Monopolies don't exist in a free market. They can exist only when government granted, and government uses force, coercion, and its monopoly on law, to enforce these unjust monopolies. Ie: the post office, public schooling, courts, etc.


Except in practice that never ends up being what happens. Walmart is out-competing ma and pa stores with a lower-cost businessmodel, not taking a monopoly position by undercutting and then jacking up prices. Home Depot did the same thing, lowering the hardware industry markup from 30% to 15% and still being able to make a profit by selling volume. That's not unfair competition, it's straight up competition. And they still don't have anything like a monopoly.

False premise. Silk Road as it turns out accounted for only 4% of the bitcoin-based economy.
Bitcoin's value is primarily derived from its lower transaction costs--not its connection to any particular marketplace. 
We've seen now both Silk Road go down, and MtGox very nearly go down and have troubles, and neither has particularly affected the value of bitcoin generally.


The world economy literally relies on the internet in today's world. There is no going back. It would be like trying to do business without the telephone.
To stop bitcoin they'd have to shut down the internet. And they know that regular people will not stand for that.
So yes, while the politicians have enormous power, they are not god.
The government has its own concern: legitimacy.
And a government which is perceived as following policies designed purely to enrich itself or favored groups will lose legitimacy and risks losing all power. This tension creates politics--the systematic lying to people to convince them that politicians are doing everything they do for the benefit of the masses.
This constrains what they can actually do and how fast they can actually do it.
Bitcoin has the edge in this battle.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:16:02


This doesn't have to be true. You can peg the principal amount to deflation/inflation such that the principal to be repaid stays at a static value.
One way proposed is to peg the amount of bitcoin to be paid back to X ounces of gold that bitcoin would buy in the future. 
The only reason we don't do that now is that it's politically popular to borrow with inflationary money and the borrows get to imagine they're screwing the bankers thereby, when in fact the bankers are just laughing and screwing them right back with the terms of the loan contract. Inflation doesn't hurt them, they just tweak the contract to get theirs.
Similarly, in a deflationary economy, buyers would have to use loan provisions to protect themselves, and bankers wouldn't need to screw people to make up for the currency's value loss over time.
As for savers, they should always be rewarded.

Perhaps bitcoin is only a subset of the discussion the future have of how cryptography changed the world :) 
Cryptography takes information science and creates practical applications out of it, including the stunning ability to create unique digital items, of which bitcoin is one.
But cryptography will also, in time, defeat the current government spying programs and mass invasion of privacy.
One thing is sure, when a system relies on things staying the way they are, ala government, and things change massively, that pits the old system versus the new, and the new eventually wins. 
Cryptography is the tip of the libertarian spear, it is not merely market disruption, but government disruption, for it foils their attempts at controlling the populace both communicatively and financially.
Communication allows you to organize, against government, and finance allows you to act, against government.
In our case, of course, our action is not to oppose government militarily but simply to get from under its authority which is illegitimate. 
Governments rely on shaping information to protect their aura of legitimacy, when in fact they are illegitimate. Governments rely on financial controls to force compliance on those who realize governments have no legitimacy.
Bitcoin is the hydra that makes it possible to defeat their aggressive actions. Hydra, because if you cut off one of bitcoin's heads, another will grow in its place. You cannot defeat the idea of bitcoin, you can only in the short term defeat one version of bitcoin, only to see another grow in its place.

Eventually bitcoin becomes the unit-of-account, and that is complete adoption.

You can't really understand bitcoin without understanding the libertarian argument for decentralization.
And the second you understand the virtue of decentralization you can apply that principle across all of political economy.
For instance, capitalism is little more than a decentralized economy where everyone gets to make decisions that affect them economically.
On the other side of the coin, socialism, communism, fascism's economic doctrine were all to one degree or another about centralizing economic decisions in some central state bureaucracy.
But in fact, we don't have pure capitalism in the US, we have mixed capitalism and socialism--we have markets with political control injected into them.
The libertarian theory that this is bad for the economy and produces all sorts of ill effects resulted ultimately in an effort to produce a currency that could not be controlled politically.
We call that currency: bitcoin.

Not sure this is entirely true actually. Early movers out of the currency would see a financial boon, no doubt.
The vast majority would be able to buy coin that was gaining value steadily. But it probably wouldn't happen so quickly that many get left holding the bag. Or if it did, the fault wouldn't be on Bitcoin, but on the country inflating its currency irresponsibly.
That has happened many times in history without something like Bitcoin to save any of the people. So, overall it's an improvement in the situation.


That's because you're imagining that it has to happen overnight. It doesn't, and it won't. Because bitcoin can't gain that kind of mass acceptance overnight. It needs to broil in the real world for a bit, become a sort of shadow currency that people use to avoid dumb laws, like Argentina's law forbidding moving currency outside the country. The obvious solution is to sell currency for bitcoin and then expatriate the bitcoins easily.
In the meantime, market cap can rise naturally. 


Governments will have to move to a voluntary subscription model, which is a libertarian idea. It puts power into the hands of buyers of services and allows them to deny as need be. Power to the people? Bitcoin is giving it to them.
You don't need governments to provide those services, it's just that governments hold those services as a monopoly for themselves, to protect their power. The free market can provide protection and dispute resolution both better and cheaper, and has done so.


No, but you may arrange fire insurance ahead of time, which would include the right to have firefighters protect your building. Would be both better and cheaper than government providers.


Government doesn't have an automatic right to what I produce, nor to my resulting income. Bitcoin is only making that more clear than it was in the past.

It's a transitory problem at best. There won't be such thing as 'not having a computer' in a few decades, then there's the rest of human history where such a state of affairs will be virtually unbelievable.
Besides, when I said "the most perfect form of money" I meant it in a technical economics sense, not the mere mechanics of using it. Ideally you want several features in a money. You could use gold, but gold too has its required hardware to take it. You have to be trained in how to determine whether gold is pure, have a specific tool for weighing and gauging it. Far fewer are equipped to take gold these days than are able to accept bitcoin.
Beyond that, bitcoin doesn't require 3rd part trust, such as gold-certificates. It can also be transferred natively to the digital realm, which gold will never be able to do. And the brainwallet ability is an invaluable thing which no other currency can even touch. And that's not even talking about bitcoin's more esoteric features, like kickstarter functionality, that haven't even been touched on. Nor the awesome return to a deflationary economy which Austrian economists have been hoping to see for decades now.


As with all future claims, sure. But it's possible, the only question is how probable it is. You'd only need a couple country's economies to begin using bitcoin to see a $55k per figure.


Doubtful. It might be possible to destroy this version of bitcoin, but not the idea of bitcoin. Genie is out of the bottle. If this one fell, three more would replace it, and one of those would again achieve dominance. Governments will try, I'm sure, but I don't think they'll be successful ultimately. Again, it's a question of likelihood.


I didn't claim they'd certainly happen :) But they could happen. The entire world economy *could* run on bitcoin in a way that you couldn't run the entire world on, say, trading potatoes :P
That's why investing in bitcoin would be speculative, because while these things may happen, and I personally think them likely in the long-term, none of us can say how long it may take or what will happen in the meantime.

That's not how Bitpay works. It is practically instant. They listen for your transaction, see it almost immediately, then they simply look for double-spend attempts. If a DS attempt is not found, it's over. That's transactions has an incredibly high chance of being included in the next block, such that waiting around for small money figures isn't worth it. 
This is fine for 99% of all transactions. And the big ones, like buying a house or something, it takes you a lot of time to complete that purchase anyway, so it's hardly an issue.

Two things: 
* It's decentralized nature which abandons the need for 3rd party trust, which has effects like drastically improving the reliability of the currency and making inflation on whim impossible.
 
* It offers the lowest possible transaction costs of all currencies. Where Visa and MC charge entire percents to transact, a bitcoin transaction costs mere pennies, and can be made free if time is not object. For more on this look up economist Peter Surda's master's thesis on bitcoin, which he completed in 2012.


You do need to know a little bit, but not much. Developers are working hard to make the system easier to use for the non-technically minded. The hardest part right now is storing your bitcoin securely so that a hacker can't take them even if you accidentally get a computer virus. Right now people are working on hardware-based wallets which will make hacking bitcoins a virtual impossibility.
Except for the issue of storing your bitcoin securely, the system is as easy and cutting and pasting addresses to pay a merchant, and as easy or easier than using a credit card. It can also use QR codes which make the whole process practically automatic. The Bitcoin-QT client is also very easy to use generally.


It's not dangerous in the sense that using bitcoin won't somehow give you a virus. But again, if you store bitcoins on your computer you'd better have good security practices. So, developers have created online wallets like Blockchain.info with two-factor identification (just like Google's two-factor identification, you receive a text-code) in order to protect your account and prevent theft. And there also is the aforementioned advent of hardware wallets that you would keep on a keychain or the like and use to validate transactions easily and securely.


Because bitcoin offers the lowest possible transaction costs of all competing currencies, and also has a few other advantages like the inability to inflate it and lower its value, and the lack of reliance on a 3rd party leading to much higher overall trust, it should in time replace all fiat currencies the world over.
Bitcoin is the most perfect form of money that humankind has yet invented, a kind of spiritual money, without physical form, and as such is perfect for facilitating the kinds of transactions that happen in virtual space in the online universe.
If online transactions continue to increase, and I think that is a fair assumption going forward, then bitcoin can only become more relevant and dominant.
I think people will increasingly use bitcoin as their national governments continue to abuse their monopoly control of national currencies, and eventually these two trends must clash, and because it will be in most people's interest to use bitcoin over fiat, bitcoin is destined to survive that clash. Whether the nation state survives that clash is another question entirely.

Not so. Currencies are valued in several ways, including all the ways a commodity or other item is valued but also in one further special way: their value as money.
Ie: how easy they are to use, how resistant to inflation they are, how likely to hold or gain value they are, how easy they are to transfer to someone and how hard to tax, etc., etc.
All of these things factor into the question of what thing to use as a medium of exchange. Gold happens to excel as a currency among all the world's other possible candidates, and in digital terms bitcoin is clearly excelling as money in cyberspace.

@_date: 2013-08-14 07:07:01


Actually I understand the situation only all too well.
What you say here is not how currency works. You're engaging in a fallacy of thinking about money that has, in the past, caused legislators to inflate currencies unto destruction, ie: check out the experience of France both pre and post revolution when they devalued their currency twice in one generation.
The fallacy has to do with the fact that currency is not 'used up' by using it, unlike all other commodities in society. A unit of currency does not lose value (ideally) when traded or held.
Demand for currency should continue to go up as the wealth of society in general is added to each year by productive work, and as more people are added to the society to do that demanding.
This only ever becomes a problem if your currency cannot sub-divide enough to be useful (ie, if the penny were worth a dollar we'd need some sub-unit of currency to price sub-dollar items in).
If you know bitcoin's design then you know this can never be a problem for bitcoin as it is functionally infinitely divisible.


The fed does not inflate in order to 'satiate demand for currency'--there is no limit to the amount of currency people demand. They inflate because it's politically expedient for them to inflate and that's all. It's not economically beneficial--the opposite in fact. But inflation allows you to steal 2% of the value from all fiat holders in an invisible manner, and thus is a means of raising revenue for a government they wouldn't otherwise have, and it is obtained painlessly and invisibly by them. Ie: the majority don't understand economics well enough to vote against inflationary policies.
Lastly, the price (of anything) is a confluence of supply AND demand. In bitcoin, since the supply of new bitcoin is fixed the price is driven almost solely by demand. 
Sure, if there were some entity that could inflate to keep the price of bitcoin stable at a target value that would create less volatility, but it would also be theft from all current holders of bitcoin.
What's more you've got several other factors, such as how people feel about the dollar affecting the *exchange rate* of bitcoin. Right now everyone's pricing in dollars, but if bitcoin becomes the *unit of account*--which at some point it will--then you won't think in terms of how many dollars a bitcoin can buy at all, and the price will automatically become less volatile, much as the dollar is stable within its sphere as a unit of account but can be considered relatively volatile when you look at exchange rates (ie: imagine if you judged the stability of the dollar by always considering how many yen can be exchanged for it, you'd think the dollar more volatile than people living in the US do, because you've added the factor of everything that's happening with the yen to the picture).
So, fixed supply, more volatility now, much less risk of volatility later.

It's an idea, an accounting entry. It has no physical value, it's only an idea--a spiritual existence so to speak. That allows it to do things that those with physical or digital-file existence can't do :)
It's something we refer to with an accounting entry, but it has no actual existence in space, apart from being referred to.
Money, btw, did the same thing for a very long time. The origin of cash is that people were trading bearer bonds to gold reserves. They had these notes that said "I owe X amount of gold at Y bank" and they'd trade these instead of going to the extent of getting the gold out and handing it over.
Bitcoin takes that into the digital age, and by virtue of being a spiritual substance, does better than gold what gold does well as a currency. Bitcoins will never be stolen from where they're stored--they're stored nowhere. Only the key to them can be lost of stolen, not the bitcoin themselves, so to speak.
Bitcoins, like gold, do not rust or lose value from being stored for a long time, and they have a very limited supply. Etc., etc.

Let's imagine the economy has adopted bitcoin. I don't know how many billions of dollars are transacted each day worldwide, but let's say it's about $160 billion worth.
Demand for bitcoin would be $160b per day.
Actual purchase transactions would constitute the majority of all purchases in that economy, driving down volatility considerably. Besides which, much of modern volatility in currencies is tied to regional politics, intergovernmental strife, and national policy. Bitcoin transcends policy by being largely immune to manipulation by it.

Unlimited meaning you have total sovereignty.
Walking around nude on your property should be your own right, yes. It's your property after all. 
Perhaps one way way a region could control that would be to have buyers of property in that area agree to a certain code of conduct as a condition of buying, or else don't buy. But once you own the land you're sovereign and you could break your word without legal consequences, otherwise ownership is meaningless and conditional. You would then face only social consequences, which historically have proven quite real and effective.

No, you'll be air-gapping this client, that's why there's a fresh OS, so it can't be compromised, and it certainly won't be online.


Sounds like you're using Bitcoin-QT client and I'm fairly sure this post assumes you're using the Armory client.


- Knowing one address can someone know how many Bitcoins are stashed in an entire wallet?
No. Since the receiving wallet address is obfuscated with a hash. There's no way to know which ones you control until you spend out of them and thereby reveal your identity to whomever is sending you whatever (as in, buy something with bitcoin and they mail it to your house)


Most wallets have several addresses inside them and do a couple complicated things to make it harder to track purchases and the like. For instance the wallet will send money to someone and refund your change to a new address inside your own wallet that related to your original, that you now own also. That's why you really need to save your wallet file. For long-term storage though I prefer the simplicity of a simple paper-wallet that doesn't have all that complexity built into it.


No. The idea is that if you spend out of a wallet its public address becomes broadcast on the network, as it becomes part of the block chain. But if you receive, the receiving address is obfuscated. So, for long-term storage, use an address you haven't spent out of, or many of them, and if you have to spend out of them, make a new unused wallet and send them there for further storage.
This is why people will have a hot-wallet versus a cold one. The cold is receive only and expires when you have to spend out of it. You spend out of it to send coins to the hot-wallet, only enough to cover what you need for w/e, and then you make a new cold-storage wallet.




Again, wallets have more than one address inside them and create chains of them for you automatically. Some clients can don't do this, some do.
So, while your wallet may say it has 10 btc in it, that may be split among 50 different addresses inside your wallet, see?

They wouldn't, this is true. Which means only businesses that exceed the deflation rate in expected productivity would get funded. Which is actually a good thing, as it concentrates funds in high productivity businesses, instead of our current situation where inflation encourages marginally productive businesses to borrow because rates are so cheap and risk going bust in the pursuit of even slim profits.
I assume, naturally, that bitcoin won't always be deflating by large percents for the majority of its lifetime--a safe assumption. We just happen to be in a period of rapid deflation due to its being so young. In time, when mature, its real deflation rate will be measured in a few percents per year or so, which will be just fine.


For one thing, there'd be a whole helluva lot more money up for investment in a savings-encouraged deflationary economy.


To some extent this is true, but it wouldn't choke off activity completely, which is my point. The 19th century, one of the most rapid business expansions in US history, was completed with continual deflation in money during that century.


Nah, you just have to have an idea marginally better than what would get you money right now. That could end up being a good thing, stronger competition for investor funds.

Quite simply, you wouldn't hang around anyone who didn't have laws about violence you didn't agree with, since they could only be prosecuted by their own law-set. Thus if there was a dude who thought it okay to kill people indiscriminately, he'd never be able to set foot off his own property, for at the door to someone else's property they'd ask him to agree to abide by the law-set governing *that* property. Thus he'd agree to not kill or else not leave his own land. Similarly he'd get no visitors if he continued to be unreasonable.
The result is agreement-based law production, crowd-sourced and self-reinforcing, without the need for forcing laws on anyone. Ostracism and self-exile faces the unreasonable.
In practice, people would simply subscribe to broad legal sets, pre-made and regionally accepted so as to make things easy. There'd be minor differences from household to household, where people would have an interest in crafting rules to their liking (ie: no shoes in the house, etc.). But the second you try to associate with someone, set foot on another's property, or buy or sell or contract with anyone, the resulting agreement would be a law between the participants.
We don't need a legislature at all.
As for resources, the best way to deal with them is simply private ownership of all property. No common property at all.

Yes, but it wouldn't be dramatic deflation such as we see now. It might be a couple percent a year tops, driven by population expansion largely and wealth increase. Nothing dramatic.


Only to the point that people prefer to save rather than to buy. When they prefer to buy, they buy. You can invest now at interest too, but people don't stop eating just to invest. Ie: a sandwich today is worth more than 8% interest a year when you're hungry. Holding a deflationary currency isn't much different from investing, and it will end up deflating much less than 8% long-term.


Yes, but since they're more productive than your bankruptcy example they can lower their prices and still make a profit. That's what I mean by more productive overall. Your first example had a business running a marginally profitable business whose profit was wiped out by mere deflation versus sunk-cost, so his profit margin was less than the expected deflation-rate. In practice no one would loan him money.
I suggest that if deflation is known to be 3%, then you only loan money to the guy who expects to make at least a ~4% profit overall. That's not too hard to do.

Well, we can say one thing with great certainty: this recent price rise has been dramatic and is likely unsustainable.
Therefore, we expect a dip. How high it will go before the dip and how low after are the only interesting questions.
Chances are both will be bigger in magnitude than the previous spike &amp; crash.
I know I'm done buying right now. I've already made 10% on coins that haven't even completed their sale yet on Coinbase. That's assuredly unsustainable. 
We should start looking at psychologically-significant numbers. There are probably people with sell orders in already at 25, same for 30 and 35, all the way up to 50. If it hits 50, I'd expect a huge sell-off and that to be the end of it. But that number would be great progress over the peak of the last spike.

Disagree, a deflationary currency encourages people to save and only gives investment money to ideas that are likely to produce a higher return than saving would. This means more investment money saved for the absolute most productive ideas, instead of marginally productive business ideas getting invested in like today with practically zero interest rates and an inflationary currency that no one wants to hold.
It would mean a more healthy and productive economy long-term, and encouraging people to save means there'd be much more investment money available, so it would balance out.

Optimal for who is the question.
Governments like to inflate because inflation is a hidden tax. They print 3% more money this year and they get to spend it before the inflation kicks in. The value they spend is instead sucked invisibly from all other holders of currency.
Obviously a system that allows one central authority to invisibly steal from all other holders of currency is not optimal. This is why it takes laws to force people to use national currencies; given a choice they'd undoubtedly choose a safer form of money. Bitcoin is proof of that.


Obviously not as fast as demand for money or there wouldn't have been deflation. In that case, the only difference between the money supply growing somewhat and not at all would be a slight change in the rate of deflation. And that supply growing was placed in the hands of miners who would then spend gold as if it were received currency, creating local comparative booms of slightly less deflation around mines but not having a huge impact due to the rate of creation, unlike when governments print $100m every hour in paper currency.


Because one of the most important functions money has in an economy is to serve as a transmitter of information, via price. When prices go up or down, that is an important price signal to both buyers and sellers of goods.
For instance, if you produce widgets and the price of widgets goes up, then you will want to sell more of them. Basic supply and demand.
But in today's fiat-world, how does the producer of widgets know whether the price has gone up because demand has increased, or rather because of inflation? He really doesn't know, he has to hedge, to guess, and to wait much longer than otherwise to be sure it's not just inflation. So the pace of business planning is forced downwards to the detriment of the economy. And if he bets wrong, if it's actually an inflationary boon, then if he ramps up production he can be ruined.
But in a fixed-supply economy, both producer and consumer can eliminate one side of the price equation. Price will always be determined by **demand**, because supply is either fixed (or as now, increasing at a fixed rate in Bitcoin). So when it comes time to do economic planning, you can trust the prices you're seeing as being representative of demand changes solely, not inflation in the money supply.
That's just a few aspects off the top of my head, I'd suggest Rothbard's *Man, Economy, and State* if you're interested in a scholarly study of economic theory that's still digestible for those outside the field.

People have a banking mindset. It's what they grew up with. They'll need the interface before they can finally say, wait a minute, I can be my own bank.
And it might be the next generation who largely does that compared to the older gen that lives with the interface.
I don't doubt there's room in the bitcoin space to create a bitcoin bank to manage people's coin for them. I would be quite happy to see that, as if done well could lead to more adoption, as it could alleviate certain difficulties like security and exchange problems for the less technically minded.
As for pulling the rug, yeah, it'll happen, but on a regional basis, and thus those who see it done elsewhere first will likely have time to escape into being their own bank.
Bitcoin is a poison pill for the modern fiat currency system, while at the same time being impossible for those who benefit from the fiat system to destroy.
They will try to fetter bitcoin with regulation, to keep their enemy closer, to pinch people if they can't block bitcoin directly.
It won't work long-term, but they're buying time by it. There's no other effective strategy. And there aren't that many of them who actually understand the stakes. They must, by necessity, keep the vast majority in the dark and can never give away the game publicly. They can't be honest about their support of fiat nor why they will try to block bitcoin.
What bitcoin will need long-term is a natively adapted region. A place that accepts bitcoin for what it is, without fetters.

Synchronizing means downloading the blockchain transactions it missed since it was last turned on, verifying them.
It also has to verify the integrity of the blockchain you had already downloaded previously. Then it mates the two and actively downloads new transactions to keep itself up to date as long as you have it running.
Once those two things are done it will recognize the transaction to your client-wallet and you will see the funds now in place (assuming you sent them to the right address, as others have said).

I don't think this is valid. Ultimately a healthy economy creates specialists, and here we have specialists being employed to take care of the financial side of the equation.
These arrangements are likely the fault of the businesses involved wanting to immediately convert into dollars on receipt.
You'd see that behavior disappear if we had a bitcoin-native economy. But I still wonder if you might not still have specialist companies--the bitcoin equivalents of mastercard and visa, as payment processing specialists, there to keep track of confirmations and insure transactions.

Who's doing the coercion? Your stomach? Ridiculous.
And you don't -have- to sell your labor to anyone, you can labor entirely for your own benefit if you like. There's no law that says you must be employed.
Most people CHOOSE of their own free will to work for a business owner because the business owner offers them productive capital to work with. Your labor plus the owner's productive capital means you're far more productive working for someone else than you would be working on your own, even after the owner takes his cut of your earnings as profit in exchange for use of his capital.
Thus, it's win/win for both parties.

If you accept that as true then you believe demand for bitcoin will increase until market saturation, and therefore price will rise until then too.

Couldn't disagree more. Government is just a group of men. The free market has groups of men too. Except the market actually responds to demands and can be held accountable, the government cannot.
The government uses its legal monopoly to give itself a monopoly on other services, like police protection, currency production, and dispute resolution, for which it taxes you to provide.
However, since it has a monopoly, we're assuredly paying a monopoly price for those things (being taxed for them) and receiving the worst possible service at the same time, due to there being no possibility of competition.
No, the free market could do it both cheaper and at higher quality at the same time.

That would be a worst case scenario actually, and a far larger change than is needed, because it creates the possibility of an A/B attack. An attacker could have Scrypt-ready hardware to go anticipating that outcome.
Besides, it would be far easier and cheaper to continue with the current algo and simply patch out a new client which specifically ignores the attackers blockchain.
That would take probably a day of coding.
There's also the ability to blacklist certain nodes which is why I say it would have to be distributed too.
When the attack cost millions and your defense costs maybe a few hundred, you have a massive advantage--and the nation states know it, which is why they are unlikely to try it.
Bitcoin is a hydra--cut off its head and two more heads grow in its place. They know this. Better the enemy you know than the one you don't. So they will seek to merely slow bitcoin down for the time being rather than outright attack it.

Long-term deflation is practically a guarantee. In fact price has been increasing despite the regular creation of new coins. The article is right that the number of coins is inflating continually, but because this creation rate is slower than the rise in demand, the price has continued to increase.
What I think is important is I've never seen anyone quantify the exact coin-creation rate in these terms before.
A year ago the price was fighting 30% inflation in the btc supply due to block-solving rewards. Today it's fighting 11% inflation, and yet the price continues to increase.
We have to assume the coin creation rate is having a significant effect on holding the price of btc down, because of the effect of supply and demand. A 30% coin-creation rate, year over year, is very large comparatively. Even 11% is significant, as in today, and we should expect the price of btc to be suppressed because some of the demand for btc is being mopped up by the creation of new coins. Probably a very good portion of it in fact.
By the time we're facing only 4% or less inflation in coin-creation, some three years from now, there will be even less pressure holding the price down.
It could even be that the current price spike is a direct result of the halving of the block-chain solving reward from 50 btc to 25. Effectively, everyone who sells btc has half as much to sell as before, reducing supply immediately available for sale considerably.
If true, then we should expect the current peak to slough and then plateau much higher than after the last peak, and then we'll expect a similar bump in future block-halvings. Time will tell.

Do I own myself? If so then I own the product of my labor. However when I earn something a 3rd party steps in, the government, and claims I owe them a portion of what I earned myself.
That is theft.
Your attempt to escape that fails at that point.


False, everything we do with taxes now could be replaced with a voluntary mechanism such as voluntary subscriptions and donations.


People bought war bonds for WWII, a form of voluntary subscription. As for education, it was free market for centuries before the government took over. And courts are just a market service the government gave itself a monopoly on. Free market courts would be better and cheaper.


You're justifying theft again because you agree with a certain political end that it serves. But a desirable end cannot whitewash immoral means. 


If everyone decided murder were legal, would it be ethical to murder? It would not. There is a suprapositive ethics that supersedes positive law, that is the basis of positive law.

No, since they are free market courts none of them have a monopoly on dispute resolution and must trade on their reputation for fairness. Also, either participant can easily veto a particular court if they suspect foul play or bribery and agree on another one.


Again, seasteading context. Land (or should I say water) is abundant and free. China has 1 million square miles, so does the US, the Pacific Ocean is 65 million square miles.
Plenty of area to homestead at will, and that's just on the surface.
Besides, every "poor person" owns at least themselves and their productive capacity. That's where civilization got its start.
A society like this would likely be far wealthier generally, which would be far better for poor people.


What power? There is no politics, no politicians, no ability to force laws on others--there is no power. The is only agreement and markets.
Power lets you force things on people. That cannot be achieved in a society where the legal sanction to use force is **absent**. 


You'd simply buy water and produce, as now. And again, seasteading. Water? You're surrounded by water. A simple desalinator will make more water than can be drunk.


In an individualist society the only power anyone has is over themselves and their property, never over others. That would be a massive improvement over the current situation where the rich can buy favorable laws and legally discriminate against anyone thereby.
You don't understand how backwards your view is.


Haha, that's not ridiculous to say at all now is it :P
There's no damage to be done. I don't intend to implement this in the US.

I just said.
They save 1 btc the first month.
Deflation occurs.
They save 0.9 the next month let's say, though value remains the same.
Then they save 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, pretty soon they're saving 0.00000001 btc a month, at the same value as 1 btc originally.
Each month THEY **ARE** INCREASING their total holding of bitcoin, but not at anyone's expense because it's coming out of the circulating currency amount that facilitates exchanges.
The result is not that no one can save, but that the total amount in fluid circulation goes down leading to further deflation and further subdivision of the currency to serve exchange purposes.
This process can happen indefinitely, and thus is not a problem at all for anyone.
Your imagined scenario fails to take into account the large pool of money that is not saved but continually used to facilitate transactions. This pool is far larger than the pool of saved money typically.
If everyone saves 1 btc out of the circulating amount, then deflation occurs rapidly as the supply available to facilitate exchanges shrinks. If they invest that money it goes back into the economy for a time too.

No. Ultimately if BTC takes off, it's likely that LTC will die a slow death or hang-on weakly for a long-while.
LTC survives now because it serves as a cryptographic hedge against a successful 51% attack on bitcoin.
LTC's Scrypt algorithm makes that attack far harder.
Ultimately path-dependence and the bandwagon effect will drive people into bitcoin over LTC. Meaning that the more people who participate in bitcoin, the more valuable it becomes to everyone and the more likely others become to choose it over others, including LTC.
Only if bitcoin stumbles in some massive way will LTC catch fire. It's nice to have a plan-B, but that's all it is for now.
And I really see no reason why bitcoin would stumble at this point. All lights are green.
People say LTC is silver to bitcoin's gold--it's not a good analogy because silver's usefulness was due to gold's unability to be cut down in size for small transactions.

Capitalism is individualism applied to the economy. You wouldn't apply the market to families, etc. But individualism may take other forms in those contexts.
For instance, in the West we allow children to choose their romantic partners, give them legal control of their lives at the age of adulthood, and allow them to choose what field of study to go into, etc. 
In many parts of the world less individualistic in terms of family, your marital partner and occupation will largely be determined for you. And you may be inculcated with the idea that the purpose of your life is to serve your family and support your parents rather than live for yourself and your own ends. Many women especially will be inculcated with the idea that they exist to serve their husband and family, and must bend for them rather than co-equal. In some parts of the world, they're forced to cover from head to foot. Not of their own choosing, and often against protest, such as the recent crackdown in Iran and Egypt.

That you must work to live is not where the voluntary choice lies, it's whom you choose to work with and what to do. You're not being forced to work with anyone. You can talk about  being "forced into a system" but that system is something like living in a human body that has needs. Suddenly breathing isn't voluntary because you'd die without doing it.
Let's not conflate biologic necessity with moral choice. You must work to live. But what work you do and who you work for is entirely voluntary on both the part of worker and employer.
The contrast is the system that takes away your choice of venue, job, and employer and says you will be a carpentor for X employer. That is the antithesis of voluntary. Not simply being able to float in lala-land and have all your needs met without work (as some socialists seem to think would be the ideal).


Everyone is an owner. You own first your body and the product of your labor.


False, they can, and some have, moved to the woods and lived sans employer. Some have also started businesses and had no employer.

Well, we're certainly going to disagree there permanently.
If one person wants to sell, they must do their due diligence on whether that's a good idea. It's not fraud merely if they come to think it's in their interest to sell at the moment, say by reading a bearish article, and someone completely unrelated to them makes a profit on that wrong belief buying the coins they sell on the open market. 
The market is only in that case rewarding correct forecasting. Certainly there has been no coercion.
It would be fraud if someone lied to them and also convinced them to sell coins to them in particular based on that information. But they didn't due their due diligence in that case.
Thus the market will come to incentivize non-naive activity. I'd rather have a non-naive than try to rely on laws to make a market fair, which only ends up driving nefarious behavior into more esoteric schemes, and actually allows the powerful to manipulate the legal code to create those schemes.

It's clear there's demand for this item--I want one myself--but what's even more clear is that the great barrier here is not building a working device but somehow establishing enough trust for it to be accepted.
I honestly don't know how one can reasonably establish and keep that trust with a device like this. It's like you'd have to establish as much trust as bitcoin itself has, otherwise it's the weak link in the chain.
The ultimate solution might be simply to open source the plans and let people build their own rather than trying to sell a device, unfortunately.

Not voluntary taxes; you wouldn't set a tax rate and then voluntarily let people pay.
Rather, let's say you want to fund an artist. We do that now by taxing people and letting bureaucrats decide to give artists money. We fund scientific studies in the same manner.
Instead of doing it through a government bureaucracy you'd contribute to them directly, yourself. And if you didn't want to take the time to learn about things and find worthy people, you contribute to an organization setup specifically for that purpose.
So what is there to police? If you want to give donate your money towards any purpose, you do so. If you don't, you don't. It's entirely voluntary.
Since government legitimacy is based on consent of the governed, if the government doesn't have your consent to do X with your tax money, then it is unethical for them to take and spend it. People have said that if taxes weren't compulsory that no one would pay--that's an indicator that they are unethical in the first place! And that people don't feel they're getting a good return on that money.
By contrast we pay for things voluntarily all the time when we think it's in our interest, on the market, and if something doesn't serve us we buy from someone else. The government doesn't want to have to compete for our dollars, so they abuse the law to give themselves a monopoly on certain services and make it illegal not to pay. But the who thing is a scam.
If the government is naught but representatives of the people, then you must realize you cannot delegate to a representative a power you do not yourself have. It is unethical for any citizen to force another to give money to someone against their will, that would be theft or extortion. So where does the government obtain its right to force anyone to pay a tax? An immoral law is no law at all.

This is the government currency-mismanagement I've been talking about.
It's not in the interest of consumers to inflate a currency. It steals wealth and value from the people, disrupts the whole pricing structure, and causes business to pull back from investing.
The only one that gains is the government. Last time Chavez inflated massively, he also told businesses they had to keep prices the same or else face having their companies nationalized.
He's nothing but a thug-tyrant, an expert in Bismarckian political techniques, promise the masses wealth in exchange for control. But somehow the poor still never get wealthy.
It's time for people to move into an uncontrolled and uncontrollable currency, Bitcoin, and the first ones to wake up to this change will be the most highly rewarded.
Governments cannot be trusted with fiscal policy. They can't be trusted with police powers, nor war powers, nor dispute resolution powers either, but especially not with currency.

This is partly why I think the US gov won't openly oppose bitcoin before it's effectively too late. It's a true market disruption.
Then, moments after this law passes, the middle east OPEC nations realize the US hates bitcoin and that they could escape pricing oil in dollars and start pricing oil in bitcoin, thus forcing US companies to either break the law and buy bitcoin in order to buy oil, or else the US would have to repeal the bitcoin law.
Either way, Bitcoin-user affected positively.
Start pricing oil in bitcoin and the dollar will sink like a stone.
So, if the US opposes bitcoin openly, it could accelerate the uptake of bitcoin throughout the rest of the world. We might very well then welcome US opposition and criminalization, except that most of us are US citizens, myself included, and that would put a serious damper on our ability to buy more :P
It would be stupid of them to make bitcoin illegal tho, and self-serving of them, because bitcoin isn't something that is intrinsically [aggressive]( in any sense. It can be used to commit crimes, just like anything else, or to do good, as today's charity example showed.

When money is sent to an address you own, the address you own is not revealed publicly, only a hash of that address. Your receiving address is only revealed when you spend out of it, so it's all in one direction, and obfuscated somewhat.


I believe this is possible, but I'm not quite sure. I know wallets are designed to generate associated keys and addresses and will let you spend out of all the 'invisible' addresses as if it were just one address, but I've never looked into the mechanics of it myself as to whether these would be in fact done from all those multiple addresses behind the scenes. But the mechanics of a wallet are such that you could have thousands of addresses in it and you see the total and can spend from it as if it were just one, and the client takes care of the rest behind the scenes.

I don't deny any of that, it's just that it would've been more economically efficient to let it happen on its own. So speeding it up with government doesn't have a non-zero cost.

And you're here saying bitcoin cannot adopt greater privacy standards. Therefore, zerocoin has an in. And if the market values privacy over non-privacy (obviously it does), then zerocoin has a real chance.

Time to hustle. You can hustle $100 no sweat. Pawn something. Sell videogames. Side jobs. Do something.
Gambling tho, man, it's not a great thing to be addicted to. Why not put your money into something that is more likely to make money than to lose it.
When the odds are against you we call it 'gambling', when they're in your favor we call it an 'investment.'
But you're probably really susceptible to the emotional rollercoaster of gambling. Those emotions are addicting. Get some help, gamblers anonymous.
Why worry about credit starting a business someday, gambling addiction will ruin your life. And I used to live in Vegas!
First time I turned 21 and went to Vegas to gamble with $50 I didn't need, I went down to the blackjack tables and watched a guy lose $5,000 in the space of 15 minutes. It was such a lousy streak the dealer was apologizing to him even as she took his money. Every time he got a seemingly promising hand, 19 or 20, the dealer seemed to somehow get just one more, 20's and 21's, like clockwork.
Put me off card games for life :P
And if you know the odds, there's no point in many other forms of gambling where long-term involvement guarantees loss. In fact, if you had to gamble, the way to do it would be one time only, with your life savings, in as close to 50/50 odds as you can get, [like this guy](
If you do keep gambling tho, save yourself the trouble and don't ever get married :P no need to add heartache to poverty.

Democracy is actually predicated on the socialist ethic which says that the group is more important than the individual. Democracy is a political legitimation tool the mass uses to force their will on the minority. It's all in the same basket. 
In an individualistic society the masses would be unable to force their will on the individual or smaller groups, thus an individualist society would not use democracy.

Listen, Coinbase is in beta.
They have an expert-system that rates their transactions. Sometimes it gets them wrong. Their system is still learning. They do $1m in business a month, they don't have human beings looking at each transaction.
They also have great customer service when it comes to this problem. Email them and a human being can undo the cancel and give you the price you paid as well, and also keep it from happening again.

That's what you were meant to conclude, yes. Withholding relevant info and alternate interpretations and theories is a form of brainwashing. Enjoy.


Sort of, but not entirely. Mises's and Rothbard's theories build an entirely new edifice, built largely on Menger's insights. It is not merely an extension of classical economics, though some have slighted it as such. I don't know how much interest you have in economics, but look into the Austrian Business Cycle theory. If you want a university level introduction to Austrian economics, the best would likely be [Murray Rothbard's "Man, Economy, and State"]( free on the Mises.org site btw) which is a distillation of Mises's magnum opus work "Human Action" and also breaks new ground in its own right.
You'll find Austrian economics has an alliance of sorts with libertarianism and the politics of freedom as a political value. Rothbard was a polymath and virtually responsible for the creation of the modern libertarian movement, in addition to his economic scholarship. Actually he was prolific in many areas.
Bitcoin itself is an expression of that political value of freedom, for bitcoin dispenses with the need for a trusted 3rd party in currency, valuing decentralization over central control, which is what libertarianism seeks to achieve politically and economically as well.

Well, it's easier to get people to try a different form of digital money than to get people to accept digital money in the first place. In Kenya, people already accept digital-money. In China, they have as far to go in that respect as Americans do, so we should expect slow adoption in both places.
But in Kenya, you could see very rapid adoption due to existing cultural acceptance of e-money combined with the gigantic cost savings that bitcoin offers in the form of lower transaction costs!
Kenyans sending or receiving money across borders will save up to 10% by avoiding Western Union.
With that kind of utility, might not be long before bitcoin supplants M-Pesa entirely. Could be measured in years.

This would essentially turn bitcoin into a fiat currency and re-establish a need for 3rd party trust. People would now be trusting you not to issue more coin scrip than you have gold to redeem for.
In practice this has always led to fractional reserve over time, as the trusted 3rd party realizes most of his gold never gets moved.
Eventually he lends out so many multiple claims on each piece of gold that people get suspicious and the result is a bank run and then they tar and feather you :P
Bitcoin is not backed by anything necessarily, but if I ask what is gold backed by, suddenly you have to think twice.
Gold is "backed" by itself, right? By its qualities as a precious metal.
Well bitcoin is "backed" by its qualities as a crypto-currency. Like gold, it's supply is strictly limited, in fact far more limited than gold.
Unlike gold it is a digital good, which allows value to be transmitted directly via communication channels. This makes it the most efficient means of exchange over very long distances, where shipping gold or cash or any non-digital currency would be expensive, time-consuming, and risky.
So, in the same way that gold is "backed" by the laws of the universe that make it materially what it is, bitcoin is "backed" by the mathematical laws of the universe that make it cryptographically what it is.
People think of gold having value (to them) in at least a few ways: commodity value, exchange value, and value storage over time. Gold's commodity value is quite low compared to its exchange and value-store value today, but the three intermingle.
Bitcoin's commodity value exists, but is vanishingly small, the price of some electricity that makes up its bit, and also the cost of hardware and electricity that went to producing it. Bitcoin's exchange value is where most of its price increase is coming from and will continue to come from. People are demanding it as currency because it offers the lowest transaction costs for doing business online of any money you can choose.
This is the conclusion of economist Peter Surda whom did his master's thesis on bitcoin (search for his name for more info on him and his thesis).
Since most everyone on earth has an interest in trade, and wants therefore to trade at the lowest possible transaction cost, we expect the market for bitcoin as a currency to expand dramatically in the future. That is, we expect demand to soar, which combined with limited supply means price increases.
To return to your suggestion, I've heard there are alt-coin schemes to create gold-ledger digital currencies, but you're going to find yourself right back at the same problem of trusting a 3rd party, having to audit gold supplies continually, and the various ways all that can be manipulated. Inflation once again becomes a possibility.
I won't be surprised if nation states one day try this scheme, digital fiat currencies, but they will be a poor money comparatively.

Defence would be handled by private security companies that service local areas. In the event of regional external conflict, these companies could band together into something approximating a military. I don't think it would be a huge problem at all. It'd be like taking all the police departments in the US and having them defend against an invasion in the absence of a military.
Our police aren't setup to do that. But in a free society where the security forces would know this would be the likely solution, they'd put plans in place ahead of time and probably do periodic drilling together as a larger military force instead of single units.

It does, actually, if you understood what government actually is.
In libertarianism we use the Non-Aggression Principle as the standard ethical rubric. Under the NAP, all governments are inherently aggressors and cannot be viewed otherwise. 
They are aggressors because they maintain regional monopolies and actively prevent new competitors to their own power from rising up.
They act by force, and even claim the legal right to do so--when they cannot legitimately claim such a right.
Similarly their territorial monopoly is by claim only and equally illegitimate, for the government never bought, paid, nor traded for that land and thus has no right to exercise dominion over it like a true property owner.


Comparative efficiency within a class doesn't mean they're the most efficient structure bar none. Governments simply aren't. They cannot be because they by necessity centralize decision-making, and we know that decentralized decision-making is by far the most efficient and responsive way to make decisions.
We see this in the economy, where capitalism has won the efficiency argument over centralized economic forms like socialism. Why is this reasoning not then applied to politics and law? Why can I not control what laws I wish to live by? If political power is derived from consent of the governed, then I withdraw all consent over my existing government. Thus, I should be free--but they use force to claim I am not and continue to aggress against me.


You're wrong, and I've spent the last several years building theory for exactly such a system, one that can easily scale to billions.

There is some historical precedent for this.
Britain reversed all their draconian import/export laws in the face of competition from American Clipper ships which lacked comparable regulation.

Finite supply, increased demand. That's the only reason it will ever go up in price.
As to why people are demanding more, you have to look at Bitcoin in context as a commodity with currency-like attributes, in comparison to digital transactions with regular currency.
If ultimately people prefer bitcoin over other currency do to its differing nature and the resultant qualities and character of a bitcoin-transaction, it will continue a meteoric price climb until everyone knows about it and it maximizes its potential demand.

I'm not sure that's true at all. The oil we've mined to this point has been cheap in the sense that it's sweet crude, meaning low-sulfur crude, meaning cheaper to refine.
The amount of oil out there that is sulfur-bound is much larger than the amount of sweet crude available. Similarly there are many smaller wells around the world that are to expensive to operate at X market price but that fire up when the price rises high enough to make a profit pumping them.
The amount of oil available at higher per barrel prices is orders of magnitude more than what's available at lower magnitude prices because of these factors.
Most of the oil in the world is not low-sulfur. Only when the price of oil becomes high enough to make medium and high-sulfur oils cost-effective to refine do those reserves find their way to the market.


That's because historically tech has tended to solve these problems. When one energy generation tech comes to the end of its useful life and the price of energy begins to rise, eventually it will reach a price that makes the next most efficient energy production technology cost effective and that will take over the market. 


Yeah, call me a technofixist, but I think tech will solve the sustainability problems he outlines there. There's a lot of unknown he takes for granted, and most of those unknowns are future tech arising. We may be colonizing other worlds before we really have to worry about sustainability in the sense he worries. And people predicted worldwide starvation a century ago, but tech fixed that.

Generating identical addresses on accident is so extraordinarily unlikely due to the number of possible addresses that you'd be better off worrying about the possibility of becoming allergic to water first.
The number is something like 10 to the 80th power ( 10^80). There aren't even 10^80 atoms on the planet earth, nor in our whole solar system, nor our entire galaxy, nor in millions of galaxies.
So, it would be like accidentally picking the same atom twice out of millions of galaxies. You're protected by an unfathomably large number.

Actually I'm giving you a highly technical answer. People tend to misunderstand it as a result of its simplicity and their own lack of economic knowledge for context. Perhaps you haven't studied enough econ to know about the issues surrounding transaction costs.
But, in fact, bitcoin's lower transaction costs constitute its compelling value proposition for use across the entire economy and going forward. If it weren't for these lower transaction costs, people wouldn't choose bitcoin over other kinds of money.
And this is a summary of Peter Surda's Master's thesis on bitcoin from 2012. He, naturally, goes into more depth, on things like path dependence and the like. You can find his thesis online.
I did see a breakdown of places bitcoin was being spent awhile ago, inductive assumptions largely, but it seems that SR is a small amount of transactions these days. Bitcoin does what, like $20 million in transactions a month, something like that? SR does $25m a year in transactions, apparently.
Those numbers are old though, so I don't know how much faith to put in them today, though I'd expect the trend to continue.
More bitcoin has likely been spent on the ASIC market this year than any other single sector, constitutes at least dozens of millions of dollars in transactions, easily.

They may not know it in theory but they feel it viscerally. 
That's why for instance Amazon coin will only ever be used at Amazon. Because the people who do know what they're doing will never suggest it, and never build services around it, because they know it's dumb to trust Amazon with a currency.
And since those cutting-edge people will never lead in that direction, neither will the non-thinking masses follow there.
Obviously the case is different with bitcoin which did inspire trust in those who understand these issues and thus caused the masses to follow them, having trailblazed.
People look to other's behavior to understand what they can trust, that's a primary trust signal. If others are trusting you, they'll trust you.
And the first to trust are those who *understand*. They lead the way for those who don't *understand*.
Don't underestimate the role of social cues in this regard.
Thiel's law says a good money will drive out a bad one in a free market. You're saying the opposite is true.
Ultimately, bitcoin's decentralization is more trustworthy than a big bank name. That's the fact. You may not believe that, seems you don't in fact, but that's what the market is saying is true, for they haven't accepted previous centralized offerings, but bitcoin they have.

Okay, so 1 bitcoin is worth 100 dinars.
But suppose the government is inflating by 30% annually or we expect that. We take a discount to account for that, plus a small percentage for profit, say 10%.
So now, instead of giving me 100 dinars for 1 bitcoin, you're going to give me 110 dinars for 1 bitcoin, that's the discount rate. That's worth it because if you hold dinars instead you'll have 30 less end of year rather than 10 less.
The dinars then have to be converted into a commodity which can be sold somewhere for bitcoin, or eventually turned into bitcoin, and the cycle continues.

Banks hold it as an obligation they pay out of their own funds. Governments don't have any funds at all that they earn, their funds are unethically stolen from taxpayers.
Banks therefore can make a legitimate promise. Governments cannot.


My point should be obvious: if they're investing they aren't starving.


Company's owners are shielded by limited liability, and executives (who are responsible for decisions) are just not liable for losses.
In an actual free society there would be no LL laws to protect them. So, again, it's government giving business an illegitimate grant of protection--collusion between them--that is the problem, and the problem roots from government, not business.


It is biased towards risk taking, actually, since any profit or loss will not be taken out of the pockets of the decision-makers. Good decision or bad, it's all the same to them, and "oversight" has the same problem.
Your faith in government is completely misguided.
And as for compensating out of budget, it can't do that without violating people's rights by stealing that money from them. That's hardly a solution.
It may be a big money hole, but it's immoral for them to take from it.


That's fine if you want to do it with others that agree, but you have no right to force your way of life on me and those who don't agree. Fuck off with your laws.

Then you should agree that if you dispute my title and ownership then we'll go to a judge who will examine your claim and throw it out, since I can produce proof that I bought my land and you have none.


No, ownership is individually transferred. Ownership existed long before governments and exist where no government exists.

No, that's not what's been happening. People can't get money out of Gox so they've been holding bitcoin, and some have bought bitcoin with money they have on Gox to get that value out as bitcoin.
10% reflects the confidence people have in Gox rectifying their problem. So right now, the crowd thinks there's a 10% risk that Gox will fold, compared to other exchanges, let's say.

I heard it buys some 30% of all newly mined coins right now. Then it sells you coins at market-price. It probably builds a discount into its purchases for volume sales and to cover its profit spread.

Printing money causes problems that printing more money can't fix, yes.
The Austrian Business-Cycle Theory explains that printing money to boost the economy during down turns creates economic distortions that lead to further economic disruptions, until you have big bubbles caused by those distortions, ie: 2008 financial crash. These are inevitable if you follow the keynesian monetary-pumping strategy.
What was the government's response to these dramatic events? Create/borrow trillions of dollars, ie: print more money.
The way out is actually to let the economy normalize without intervention, *hands off!*, and return to a sane basis and begin growing organically. It's short term pain and long-term healthy growth if you do that, versus long term continued distortions from failing to allow businesses that deserve to fail to fail.

The money gets wired to their account then held as a buy order. Of that they make less than 1% when someone sells bitcoin for the customer's incoming cash. That holding account was seized.
So, on what would be earnings of $50,000 they lost $5 million. They'd have to process something like $500 million in orders to make back that lost $5m of customer money.

Oh, I forgot this entry wasn't on :P
Look, if voting could change anything, it'd be illegal.
Voting exists to give people the illusion that they have a say in their government. Ultimately they don't. Have you ever voted directly for any policy at all? Only a few states have the initiative process, such as my California, and even there we've had initiatives struck down by the CA supreme court, so it still didn't matter. Unelected elites decide what will and won't be law and the people have little say. 
Democracy supposedly is about the consent of the governed, but you only get to actually choose who governs you, you don't have input on -any- policy decisions. 
So can you really say you've given consent? No.
I withdraw my consent, and that means I no longer vote either. Brand is entirely correct that it achieves nothing. When your vote is but one drop in the bucket and can't influence your own legal circumstances directly, it doesn't even matter.

He used British english first then American.
His programming style traces down to someone likely learned in 2000, and he's good at C.
His time of day entries on Github point to the eastern seaboard of the US if you took it as him having a normal work schedule.
He's never spent a single bitcoin he mined, so that's not going to work (ie: seller would have his physical address to send a product to him or something).
And textual analysis has been done of the white paper, finding nothing, and that's notoriously hard to do anyway conclusively.
Lastly, he's burned the identity. It hasn't shown for the longest time.
He may be equally a lone genius who studied these things in his spare time, or a libertarian-minded government black-cryptographist (actually rather likely) and thus may be anonymous even in real life and perhaps even militarily trained in online anonymity systems, or he could be someone in business or industry, or a college professor-type who teaches crypto.
The strongest clue anyone has is he's a crypto / programming expert who probably didn't realize he was going to invent a currency years before he actually did it, so his name may already be publicly linked to those topics.
However he may only be a really smart programmer with a lot of math training who was able to grok and implement the crypto others had come up with. He didn't need to innovate any crypto on his own, only apply it to the system.
There's so so many programmers out there at his level who could have an interest in crypto (crackers, duh), and most of this crowd has libertarian leanings of one sort or another.
So yeah. Chances are, his identity gets revealed when and where he wants it to be. 
There's only one conclusive proof and it involves the key to signing a message on the bitcoin network and to certain trusted peoples who communicated with SN and setup a way to reconnect verifiably if he ever came back out.
I think if we get a [seasteading](community going long-term he might move there, and if bitcoin changes everything and the political danger of it passes on relatively soon, he may well reveal himself and take some well deserved credit and spend some well earned bitcoin.

Bitlaw is an attempt to enable a polycentric legal system by building a voluntarist legal platform using technology.
Thus it's both an idea and an app/program that you would run. The idea is fairly well formed, the app still needs a lot of work.
If we were in a free society, people would be able to choose laws for themselves and their property, as individual sovereigns. There would be no one forcing law down your throat like states do now.
Thus people would need a means to send, receive, and edit law for themselves.
Bitlaw is trying to fill that gap.
It must hold your personal law set. It must be able to send laws to other people without dependency on a central server (thus P2P), much like you can send messages using Bitmessage.
You must be able to edit provisions in and out of the contract easily.
There needs to be a cryptographic signature mechanism which can hash the document with the time-stamp and provide proof of signature, sent to both parties upon signing so that both can prove it was signed, when it was signed, and the exact form of the contract when it was signed so that nothing can be changed.
With this in hand, a seastead could get up and running with a polycentric system almost immediately. You could conduct business with it easily enough, doing purchase and sales contracts which would be open-sourced or purchased (for bitcoin!) from law producers. We are looking at ways to wrap a creator's bitcoin address into them such that if you use someone's law-code snippet you can tip them thereby. 
You should be able to easily issue receipts, so there may be purchase functionality in it.
While this would be of great use in a seastead, I think this could have broad application even here and now. Its use as a contract negotiating tool, allowing rapid back and forth edit and review before signing could be particularly attractive, allowing you to edit contracts in real time, make changes, send to the other party, have changes highlighted, etc.
Unfortunately I'm only a neophyte programmer or I'd have a version up and running by now.

Wow, I disagree with everything in that piece. None of those things he says we 'need' are desireable.


- Transparency requirements for the government to efficiently tackle
- Black economy
The black market is that segment of the market where two people want to trade something but a 3rd party who claims authority, not necessarily legitimately, doesn't want them to trade. Usually we're talking drugs, and drugs should not be illegal, if the last 50 years of war on drugs has taught us anything it's that you can't solve the addiction problem by criminalizing distribution.


If I produce something, I'm entitled to it. Therefore, taxation is theft. I did not agree to be taxed. Nor was I ever given a chance to vote on whether I would be taxed. "Tax fraud" is therefore not immoral, as it is the foiling of the unethical attempt by a government to extract wealth out of me by force. The fact that bitcoin will make this hard or impossible is glorious.


It's a foggy phrase. One person gives money freely to another. That's their money to do with. Where they should be stopped is where they go to commit crimes with what they buy. More difficulty issue this one, but ultimately I don't think it's going to be possible for them to stop this financing. 


It's not. Pegging is a dumb thing that fiat currencies have tried in the past. Bitcoin is not equivalent to fiat as it is uncontrolled and uninflateable. 


Banking with bitcoin is still plenty possible.


This is the one that makes me angry. What is wrong with deflation? You mistake why governments inflate with it being a good policy. Governments inflate because it allows them to *steal wealth* from all currency holders. It's an invisible tax. If there's $10 trillion in dollars out in the world and you inflate by 3%, then you've stolen some $300 billion in wealth from all holders of dollars.
The great charm of bitcoin is that it will deflate naturally for its entire existence, just like, say, gold will, because of finite supply.

In case you meant the first guy to get an Avalon showing it working, we know the 1st batch of Avalons have shipped, some 300, and are probably mining right now. 
They should account for the rapid mining rate increases we've seen since the new year, which you can see here:  
From [this site](
2nd Avalon batch has also shipping, iirc, or is shipping this month, and you'll see the hash-rate swell again. 3rd batch Avalon's, the final batch, you'll see come online in May.
Now, a bitcoin developer showed his working Avalon, but after that it's been old news, but afaik those other 300 1st batch's are all out there mining right now.
I thought you were talking about the little BFL Jalapeno that has supposedly shipped now, of which the video showed working, but not hashing &gt;_&gt; 
That video also showed it pulling some 40-43 watts regular and spiking up to 140+ watts, the power drain they've reported having trouble with. 40 watts for 4 ghashes is on par with the Avalon 63 gigahashes for ~600 watts. So I don't quite understand where others have said the BFL video demonstrated much better power usage. Maybe someone can fill me in.
Ostensibly, the Avalon dudes will take their profits and produce a batch 4 entirely for themselves, probably of some 600 units, and make out like bandits while the rest of the world tries to keep pace. It will be a very good year to own an Avalon ASIC, assuming BFL fumbles the ball. If BFL delivers after all, it will only be a good year.

If you pay for this in BTC know that they won't earn as much as they cost in BTC.
The only people who should be buying these are people who have no other way to get their hands on BTC than by buying these with fiat and then mining BTC in their own country.
If you have BTC already, you're far better holding it than buying these.
Or if you're willing to lose money to help secure the network against 51% attacks, that is, I guess, a valid reason to buy one of these, however you'd be better off buying a profitable ASIC. No one should be sacrificing their interests to secure the network, that's not how mining is supposed to go down. If mining isn't its own reward it will inevitably fail.
TL;DR: AM is charging too much for these.

We will replace the perceived need to be ruled with the ability of people to accept bodies of law created by others.
This has the effect of preserving individual initiative and choice over their own legal circumstances without the people themselves having to become legal experts.

People know they need law, but they've always accepted rule to obtain law.
We need to separate that. People can retain sovereignty and have law too via an individualist political system.

Well I'm an anarchist, I can tell you that statement is wrong. You--not an anarchist--disagree with me... okay. So you're claiming to know what anarchists want better than an actual anarchist. Right.
Anything based on a false premise is just going to become a strawman argument, so I saw no point in continuing with the article. 
As for socialism, there's nothing to disagree with. The economic calculation problem is cold hard facts and reason. It's converted every socialist who has ever actually faced it head-on, because there's no solution to it. 
It is a refutation of the economic methodology of socialism proving once and for all that socialism's economy can never be as productive or efficient as a capitalistic economy. And since the whole goal of socialism was to produce more material well-being than capitalism, there's really no point to pursuing socialism anymore. Not on economic grounds, anyway.
I sympathize and agree with many of the socialist's moral stances and arguments against war and the like, after all I'm an anarchist, one who has abandoned the veneer of patriotism for actual principle.
But the socialists are simply wrong about economic issues. So too are the liberals, who cling to keynesianism and government action in fiscal issues as a way of producing social justice by force.
They have not learned that the initiation of political force, even for supposedly noble ideals, is unethical and wrong and must be stopped.
It is the unethical use of force that the ancap has abandoned, and that makes it the most ethical ideological system that has ever been developed.
Socialists are only socialists because they are not good at thinking through or discussing economic issues. Their ideas cannot be realized economically and lead to a lot of injustices economically as well.
When they figure this out, eventually, they'll become anarchs, because we already agree on many social and ethical issues.

Pennies suck because they cost money to produce and hold compared to their value. I think if people had the option to charge in both pennies and sub-penny denominations they would do so, such as all gas being priced in $X.XX and 9/10ths of a penny.
Since bitcoin removes the cost associated with sub-penny value transfer we've seen quite a lot use of it, which seems to validate my assertion.
So yeah, I think we could use a denomination below the penny, even today.
But beyond that, wealth keeps being added to the world, and at some point in the future we would need sub-satoshi denominations, assuredly.

This was not a free market fire department, clearly, if they're collecting fees from the county. Similarly, only being in a monopoly position would allow such a company to do something like let someone's house burn, as they'd face no repercussions from competitors.


A. The police are already profit motivated--they get money from you with every ticket, every drug bust, every red light camera. If you don't recognize that I don't know what to tell you.
B. The police department has a government granted monopoly and bad service doesn't threaten it. Therefore you get the worst possible service at a monopoly price.
In a free market, if people didn't like the police department, they could replace it entirely. Everyone loses their jobs and people move on to the new company. Competition ensures good service--unlike now.
A profit motive doesn't mean they can suddenly take advantage of you--it means they cannot, unlike now. You've been brainwashed.


The sort of society ancap's suggest has not been tried in history, so I don't know where you get the hubris to make that statement.

True, but such relies on a 3rd party, Google, and also their AI system and whatnot.
Which means encryption is less possible, certainly not natively possible, and a 3rd party can read all your emails. I think most people would choose a system of more privacy over one that creates less, and both systems are likely to be equally unspammy. But this way you don't need Google.
We need to move beyond 3rd party trust. That's what bitcoin has done for finance. Continue the revolution, do it for email.
It would also allow you to get paid for letting people advertise to you directly, instead of funneling that money to the 3rd party (google), something Google can't match :P

Let's say you could encode your voice in ordered entangled particles. They have to be close to each other to entangle them so. Then you move them far apart, at sub-lightspeed, and someone could decode your voice at a distance.
There's no way to entangle them together, move them far apart, and then change the entanglement at a distance to encode your voice and have it show up in its pair.
Information cannot move faster than the speed of light, *either*.
Also, if one particle is read here, the entangled pair doesn't immediately give its output as if they were connected at the hip. They will give their state when read independently.

Doubtful. I stand on the principle that I am my own sovereign. I don't accept them forcing government services on me either, and especially not their jurisdiction which is a challenge to individual sovereignty.


No, I plan to move to a seastead to accomplish all this as soon as feasible.


A. Africa isn't very well situated geographically for purposes of trade and development.
B. Culture of rampant crime and a history of war, ie: no political stability.
C. Scant access to skilled workers.
The best place to put a seastead, right now, is off the western coast of the United States for a whole host of reasons and considerations, which you can find on the [Seasteading Institute's]( report on the question.
Beyond that, Somalia doesn't have the kind of ports needed to facilitate large scale trade and commerce, whereas a society built on the ocean has natively the cheapest form of import/export available: ocean shipping.

It depends on how the disputants decide to set it up initially.
Either they can agree to split the payment regardless of outcome, or have the loser pay the lion's share or the total amount, have the winner pay, or any combination thereof.
For those who can't afford it, it's likely the court would means-test prices and that legal-aid organizations would help them or pay for them entirely, just as happens now.
It's also possible some regions would pay for free access to attract people to doing business there.
But it will be more fair than now because you wouldn't be able to judge shop, since both participants must agree on the judge to be used and can balk at any time, so there are no jurisdictions to sue in, and any judge in particular could get work only if he had an impeccable reputation for fairness, because neither side wants to be screwed by a corrupt judge.
As for appeals, the participants would commit to a 'best of' decision. They could decide either one trial will do it, or else bring in multiple judges and let the majority decide, or else do multiple trials and let the preponderence of judgments decide. Up to them entirely. Best of 3 verdicts or trials, best of 99 trials, whatever they're willing to pay for.

It would only be reasonable then to serve notice and give people whom demur a chance to leave your property. No judge would enforce an instant change such as you suggest as it would not be reasonable, thus I don't consider this a real concern.


You still need courts to adjudicate any dispute arising as a result of your laws, and they're going to adjudicate on the reasonability principle, which instant law changes doesn't pass.


You could, but it's also likely that if you found yourself "law-locked" like this that you could request or purchase travel-immunity, ie: you don't agree to the laws of the region you're traveling through, you simply want to pass through and not interact or contract with anyone.
Also, since I see this sort of legal structure arising first in a seasteading context, it's much less an issue, as there's abundant space for everyone.

You're wrong here. The workers will end up employed producing another subset of human wants. There is no effective limit to what people want to consume, and thus no limit to the amount of work that can be done.


Except that you've destroyed the mechanism of investment by making enemies of investors and historically the societies that have tried this have degraded terribly.
The moral case against owners of production is a completely flawed one. A worker makes a agreement to give up a share of their productivity because they are borrowing the productive tools of the owner. It's a completely voluntary arrangement, win/win for both, because the worker can earn more with the owner's tools, even giving up a share, than they could on their own without the tools.
The moral case against capitalism--the idea that a dollar of profit is an unearned wage--is a complete farce. You cannot call it 'theft' when it's entirely a voluntary arrangement.


Ie: theft on a massive scale, like what happened in Cambodia.


Which will never happen.


These are and will be products of capitalism. 


Same thing.


By police and courts.


They were given power by the agreement you signed to abide by X laws when you entered someone's property. They arose as companies like any company, so they came from w/e entrepreneurs exist and saw an opportunity to make profit by serving these services.


Nope, they were given power by individual contract.


You'd be convicted of violating my property boundaries, assault, and other crimes which are generally recognized. The 'do no harm' principle is a supra-positive ethical norm that one cannot not know is true.
But more than likely, to even enter the vicinity of the city my property is in you would've agreed to a basic bill of rights, and thus you'd be breaking that. 
Those who do not agree to live by certain norms will be outcast living on the margins of society without even opportunity to do as you suggest here, because they will be refused access to even roads into the city if they refuse to agree to abide by basic rights.


You might think so, but it's not. In practice people would subscribe to local bodies of common law, much as we have blue sky law now. Besides which, the internet makes GPS-based law notice a simple thing even now.


By individual agreement and acceptance.
Suppose a region likes the legal theories of a certain judge or scholar, they'd simply adopt his law-set as a whole. Voluntary law.
The other form is agreement-based law. The laws you agree to abide by when visiting another's property.


And again, direct democracy is unethical. It forces me to give up control over my own life in exchange for the will of the majority. That is an aggression. Any time you make a decision for someone against their will that is an aggression. Democracy is evil.


It doesn't matter if X isn't there, because your phone has your GPS coordinates and you can do a location-based lookup of X's legal set for this property likely with a single button press.
Perhaps X has a "roll-off" provision for spot-disputes. Both parties would then pull out their cellphone and each pick a random number, with X's server providing the random result. The closest pick to random gets the spot.
Conflict over.

You apparently have no idea what you're talking about then, neither why inflation is bad nor why deflation would be a boon.
The only even close to reasonable argument against deflation is the idea that debtor's loans would become harder to pay off over time. This is easily handled at the contract stage: peg your principle amount to deflation. Done deal.
In the meantime, an economy only becomes wealthy in the same way an individual does: by producing more than they consume. If you steal 3% or more of the economy's wealth by inflating it away, you make it harder to produce wealth, not easier. To say that inflation is theft by the government is literally true.
And the other supposed benefit, speeding up the velocity of money and rising price signals, is nothing more than market distortions being passed off as beneficial. You should not pump the market, it will and should move at its own pace.

This is only true when the political system is based on the socialist-ethic. Unfortunately, democracy is inherently based on the socialist-ethic, so all democracies will tend towards socialism over time.

has a good collection of info about paper wallets. I'll try to answer you here tho too.


Addresses are created using an algorithm that performs a mathematical operation on a random seed resulting in one of 2^256 (2E256) possible private keys being generated.
This private key is then hashed to produce a public address, of which there are 2^160 possible public addresses. 
So, it can generate them offline because it doesn't need any other info to create an address. They're all just hanging there in almost infinite possibility.
This is one of the first things I had to wrap my head around too, when learning about bitcoin. But the simple fact is that 2^256 is such a large number, there's simply so many potential addresses, that you could generate billions of addresses per second and not find a duplicate address for at least hundreds of thousands if not millions of years.
Very, very large number of possible addresses makes it incredibly unlikely that two people will ever generate the same address twice.


Not sure of the exact odds. I've been told it's something like 2^80, even if you were to find a hash collision, which is still a massive number. Otherwise it's 1 in 2^256.
How big is this number? There aren't 2^256 atoms in a million galaxies.
Take a look at this graphic: 


The addresses are being generated on your computer via javascript running on your computer. You should save the web-page and generate an address offline for absolute minimum security. More paranoid security goes far beyond that. See &gt; Plus what other storage methods would you call the safest ones? Any help would be highly appreciated.
A cold storage wallet is among the safest options possible. The question is how to generate one in a way that can't be hacked. I also recommend using a material that will survive a house fire: ie, etching the key pairs onto a chunk of stainless steel. Toss it in your safe and your coins are as good as your physical security.
Safer methods also require more technical knowledge. Among the safest is using an air-gapped PC that has never been hooked up to the net as a wallet and transaction signer using the Armory client.

A lot of people got burned buying above $100 during the $260 ramp up, and left the market bitter.
That put a damper on enthusiasm generally.
But, as with the 2011 ramp and crash, the price fell to a stable low and then slowly *nadired* until rising slowly up till 2013.
No reason to think we won't see a similar curve, with a slow valley for the rest of the year around $100 or so and a decent gain for the next two years or so.
And we can probably expect the 2017 block halving to create bitcoin fever yet again as speculators jump in just prior to it expecting to make rapid gains again.
But by then, the years between then and now may, slow-gain-wise, result in who knows what price. $200, $500, $90? it's an open question.
I'd lean more on the $200+ side, but that's me :P

It would be foolish to even try to forecast adoption rate and time and eventual price. Full adoption could happen in years or decades.
But I think it will happen because of bitcoin's lower transaction costs and the increasing prevalence of online and distance transactions in a world-economy.
Price swings are largely a result of low market cap and a centralized trading platform. A few millions of dollars right now can cause price crashes, etc. Try that in a market cap of trillions or dollars and you'd be lucky to get a swing of a few pennies, if that.
Once full adoption of bitcoin as a technology has completed, wherever the price rests there it should be relatively stable, since there won't exist new emerging demand. Everyone who knows of it and uses it will by that point, and the stready deflationary price growth will be along the lines of population increase, steady and regular in a high market-cap environ.


Volatility isn't irrelevant entirely, no, but there's easy ways to pass that risk on. Retailers now can use Bitpay and pay a 1% fee to shuck off currency risk, pricing in dollars and achieving immediate conversion of bitcoin into dollars via Bitpay.
When/if bitcoin becomes the unit of account, currency exchange risk disappears, and at that point becomes far less an issue.


Don't see why not. They don't have to insure each transaction or deal with fraud or chargebacks, they just have to scan for double-spend attempts and produce record-keeping.

I'd like to address this too.


Insider trading should not be a crime at all, should not be stigmatized, it should instead be public. Think about it like this, markets spread information by their prices. Insiders are in the best position to know something about their company. Thus, if we made public insider trades we would know how they feel about their own confidence in the company they run.
You'd have funds pop up that used insider trades as an economic indicator.
That would actually be an improvement over now where insiders are forced to hide their knowledge, but those whom are connected to them can surreptitiously buy and sell in various ways. Anti-insider trading laws also delay the public's ability to learn of something good or bad happening inside the company until it's too late to profit by it.


Both of these require government. Know first that a monopoly cannot be created on the free-market alone, it requires government intervention or government grant of monopoly to create one. Otherwise, anyone could enter the market and compete.
Similarly, loopholes exist *in law* not anywhere else. If you didn't have law as we have it now, where loopholes protect people engaging in them, you'd be able to sue for redress. Right now, loopholes make that impossible, give companies a pass, but in a free society companies wouldn't get a government grant to engage in loopholes.
If you study the subject enough, you'll discover that competition in the free market is the best guarantee of good corporate citizenship, far beyond anything law ever promised to provide. Companies actually bristle at the idea of a free market, they prefer the advantages they can lobby government for, massive tax breaks and government protection of their market position which insulates them from competition on the marketplace.
Most people have got it entirely backwards--it's not government that protects us from unbridled competition, it's government that is protecting businesses from unbridled competition.


We don't actually. The government has simply monopolized several services that could easily be provided--and are provided today--by the marketplace.
Want police? That's security service. Courts is dispute resolution service--seen today in private arbitration courts. Law production? We do this with contracts and agreements for service, service contracts.
The government instead maintains a monopoly on courts, on police, and law, and also a monopoly on the production of money--which bitcoin is set out to break.
The government has begun monopolizing more and more market services as well. It's monopolized letters/mail transport, and recently is moving into healthcare. In the past it had owned railroads and driven them into the ground. 
Bitcoin is the tip of the spear in the fight between a decentralized society and a centralized one.

If the dollar tanks, bitcoin's price will rise concomitantly, since the dollar would be tanking via inflation and bitcoin would remain rock steady. 
As for the brics, the end of dollar hegemony would probably turn into local hegemony currencies. Euro in europe, Renminbi in Asia (or perhaps the yen?). 
As for South America, they'd probably keep using the dollar. 
India? Who knows.
It's too soon for bitcoin to challenge any of those, but the end of dollar hegemony would go a long way towards giving bitcoin the space to take over later on.

If you don't have freedom you can't trade, if you don't have property you can't trade, if you don't have rights you can't own to trade. Markets implies the others.
If you want freedom what you need is not government but the absence of it.
If you want private property you need only a framework of mutual respect for the property of others and the same from them, and a legal framework that recognizes property, ie: law and contracts. Both of which can be privately produced and don't require government.
And the final key is police services which can also be privately produced and does not require government.

But it wouldn't be that neat, currency value total lags behind actual GDP by let's say 10-15%
$11,590 to $12,272 is more realistic.
The immediately important figure is online transactions, which are the low-hanging fruit for Bitcoin.
While in-store transactions are essentially online already when paid with a credit-instrument (when's the last time you saw anyone write a check), let's not include these sales for now and keep to the low-hanging fruit:


We can likely expect consumer spending to begin biting as bitcoin before B2B transactions. So, 1% of, let's say $300b in today's spending (being conservative):
$300b * 1% / 11m btc = $272 per BTC, and that's our more short-term figure that is certainly achievable within the next year or three.

GDP of Cyprus: about $25 billion. Let's cut that to $20b now that they've f'd over every businessman on their island and all their foreign investors who will now run screaming for the hills before ever putting money into Cyprus again.
Let's say also that one bitcoin will change hands 10 times every year. Thus we can use that to figure what price bitcoin would have to be at to serve a $20b economy with that velocity. It'd need to be about $2b market cap minimum.
In practice there'd be a lot of new demand to start that process, at least for a couple billion dollars worth of bitcoin as people in Cyprus bought in in preparation.
So you might see the price of bitcoin double or triple if you factor in market exuberance.

Not really. No one's owed a profit in stock trading, thus no one is cheated. Maybe we could dramatically reduce CEO's wages if they're making stock trades on insider info.
Regardless, just knowing what news is bound to come out doesn't always guarantee you a profit. Nor do insiders see everything before it happens.
Suppose I'm in a rival company and we're about to release a product that demolishes the offerings of our entire industry and will put them all out of business or severely hurt them.

Quite simply, if you think ASICs and 51% are a problem that will inevitably doom bitcoin, your best move is not to try to change the POW function, but rather to simply start investing in Litecoin which already has an ASIC-hardened structure.
If you're correct, you'll make out like a bandit if bitcoin fails and people will switch to Litecoin quite obviously if bitcoin fails due to ASIC-51%.
However, if you're wrong and ASIC-51% fails to doom bitcoin, and litecoin eventually collapses in value, that will also be purely on your head.

You want to peg a cryptocurrency the answer is to go start your own, not augment bitcoin which is already working just fine without pegging.
I don't think you understand the economic theory of money if you think it needs to be pegged to anyone.

'They' ultimately, are those running the mining nodes. 'They' one abstraction removed is the Bitcoin Foundation and the programmers they hire to improve the bitcoin client.
However, the Bitcoin Foundation cannot force miners to run their software, and thus the ultimate deciders are the miners. If the miners rebelled against the BF, they could just as easily accept a fork of the software put out by any other programmer or group. 
So 'they' is also any programmer with an idea good enough to include in the standard client. This include tonal support.
Thus the system is self-reinforcing and has no single point of failure.

Not really. We write laws designed to recognize ownership, but ownership of the self is an unchangeable fact and we extend that concept to ownership of physical good.
Besides, such a society could just have you agree to their version of ownership before you are allowed to set foot in their city, so you wouldn't have opportunity here. Invasion does not need to be defined by law, it's obvious.

Owning something that others come to value highly later on is not redistributing wealth from anyone to the owners.
Similarly, those who bet on fiat and lose their shirt if and when that becomes valueless have no had wealth taken from them, they made a bad investment.
So, is it redistribution? Not in the sense we use the term, ie: it is not government action to literally take from A and give to B.
It's more like profiting from an investment that few other got into. It was not 'redistribution' to be an early investor in Apple, for instance, even though a lot of other people bet money on stocks that failed.

Utter bullshit. It's the broken window fallacy all over again but in different form.
Even if factually correct in its claim here, and I question that somewhat still, such a currency would simply create one kind of distortion that would favor short-term economic activity over long-term, which is not necessarily what you want at all.
You may encourage short-run economic gain by encouraging people essentially not to save at all, with a degrading currency, but you make it harder therefore to achieve long-term projects which people may need to save for years to achieve. And it's these long-term projects which can become the most valuable to an economy.
How can the private sector save billions of dollars collectively to put into, say, a new chip-fab, under such a system?
Well, they could save in commodity or investment form. Seems like his Austrian example didn't have access to that. Unable to escape value-loss, each person would spend as soon as they received. But that would create a short-term boom of activity, lasting depending on the size of the population, before people even in that economy invested gains long-term in relatively liquid value-store commodities available to them.
Institutionalizing inflation does not cure economic ills, does not magically make something for nothing. Depleting a society's long-run savings in the name of short-term economic gain is not an overall net.
The best solution is to stop trying to game the system, stop trying to game human psychology on the market.
If a person prefers to save over spending now *there is a reason for that*. Changing money to create incentives not to save is stupid. That doesn't create wealth, it destroys it.
Because societies grow wealthy the same way individuals do: by producing more than they consume. This excess is then saved and used to invest.
Making savings harder, less rewarding, and discouraging it through schemes like this makes society less wealthy over time. And that's not what we want.

None of these people ever seem to do that. Because they cannot. Because it's never gonna happen. They're either mistaken, fooling themselves, or otherwise wrong.

Then, long term, overall market cap increases by $1m and it becomes that much harder to manipulate the price again.
The larger the market cap, the more of a drop in the bucket $1m becomes. By the time market cap is in the billions, a $1m buy will hardly be a blip.

Yeah, that would be *more* secure, but hardly secure. If you get a wallet stealing virus, that moment of exposure will seal your fate.
It'd be better to keep the wallet on a separate PC designed to be used only when needed as a wallet.
This is why we have people interested in making hardware wallets that you could keep on a keychain that would sign transactions and be unhackable by viruses.
The most secure way to deal with a wallet known to man right now is to use a separate air-gapped PC and run the Armory client, which is capable of doing offline transaction signing.

See, this is the kind of response I'm talking about. You're making massive assumptions and drawing conclusions about them without asking if those assumptions are valid.
You assume that people couldn't or wouldn't group up as a community to buy services voluntarily. I think this would happen. It's possible to create a contract that only triggers when everyone, or some significant portion, in a community agrees to pay into that contract. Thus the security company can service entire areas while minimizing or eliminating free-riders.
My problem with taxation is that it's theft. I would like far better to be offered a chance to opt out of a community-wide contract and move away than have money taken from me by force and then have no option but to use one captive provider.
The reason we don't do that now is because it's hard to move your house on land.
But in the ocean, on a seastead, moving a house is cheap, and creating such a flexible community far easier.

If you can show harm then, law or not, you've got to make it right. Harm is a suprapositive legal principle. It will always exist regardless, and justice requires making it right. You will be entirely unmolested as long as you harm no one. That's the way it should be. But violate another's rights and you will held to account.


If their claim is bogus, that would be causing harm to you and you'd countersue to receive estoppel on their actions and remuneration for damages.


You'd first have to take the issue to court and prove it. If I refused to come to court you could get a verdict in absentia. Then you'd submit the verdict to my security company who would either agree with it and notify me that they're allowing your security company to take value from me for remuneration, or else that we want to countersue to stop the same.
At the countersuit trial, let's say your evidence was obviously a joke. The case is thrown out and all resumes as it was. You're ordered to pay restitution for causing a nuisance to me and suing falsely.
You can come up with a million 'what if' scenarios, but it's all going to work itself out. Just because you can't imagine how it would work doesn't mean it can't work.

Bitcoin use results in a higher standard of living for the user, because of its lower transaction costs compared to using other currencies.
One a $10k transaction, Visa/MC would charge you ~2%, or $200.
Same transaction with bitcoin costs about $0.13.
Which means the retailer can lower the price by $100 and still make an extra $100.
That will drive adoption both by buyers and sellers and make the economy overall more productive.
That's why bitcoin will win long-term. Sure it'll be a bumpy ride, it always is when viewed on a day to day basis, but looking back it'll be a smooth adoption curve with the advantage of distance and time.

Gold is pretty inconvenient, and a total mismatch with today's digital economy. Digital currency is perhaps too new to take over if governments got out of the way right this minute and he'd be right that we'd be back to gold, but that's not how it's going to go down.
Fiat superseded gold because governments could control physical gold, take it away even, criminalize. They would have a much harder time criminalizing bitcoin.
By the time fiat falls, people will be used to digital currencies. Just look at Amazon Coin, Microsoft points, Google wallet--it's already at work among the younger generation.

Sure, a good way is to go here: 
You'll see a full rundown there :)
Lots more info: &gt; Or what other "maintenance" do I need to do to see if this is really still working?
The big question is actually how did you generate the wallet--securely or less than securely? After that, you're relying on that level of security provided by generation method and there's nothing left to do really.
Good job for at least making a paper wallet; there's a lot of people procrastinating on doing so who really need to right now! 
I remember reading about a guy last year lost 25,000 bitcoin that he was just keeping randomly on his laptop in an unencrypted wallet! Or so he claims.
Anyway, paper wallets, when done right, offer some of the best security around right now for long-term storage.
But you have to hedge against environmental damage to the wallet. I suggest stainless-steel wallets over paper wallet. Etch the wallet keys into a thick metal plate somehow so that it could definitely survive a house fire.
I think a lot of people will lose large amount of money in the coming years to house fires and environmental accidents.
Keep your coins on literal paper and imagine if one day you come home and the dog ate your bitcoin!

If and when people start losing confidence in the dollar, movement into bitcoin will accelerate rapidly.
There exist existential risks to the dollar today, such as being dumped from reserve currency status, losing petro-dollar status, or double-digit inflation resulting from unlimited-QE mismanagement.
The dollar is propped up by being the most trusted currency in the world right now, or at least the most stable. Thus during times of trouble and uncertainty it's the place everyone's been running to while the rest of the world eyes their own and their neighbor's currencies with suspicion. But that won't last.
But if the dollar itself becomes unstable, or if inflation rises too high, the logical choice will be bitcoin. And the first one in, big, wins.
But only if we can multiply the market-cap considerably from today's figure and also build a good deal more legitimacy and liquidity. That's a pre-requisite. I think we're at least three years out from something really big like that happening.
I'm sure there's millionaires already moving into bitcoin simply as a hedge, but it's not in their interest to buy in large blocks because that would wreak havoc on the buy price, so they're dollar-cost-averaging in.

There's even something called a Tonal bitcoin which allows for infinite division natively.

Money supply is one of those issues difficult for a populace to understand the technical details of, but which is vitally important, and thus has been abused by democracies and the opinion-crafters in them, able to obtain a certain result from the electorate which can be abused.
Most of us here would be living by a sane monetary policy *if it were within our power*.
You're right that the fight continues if the mechanism of democracy continues to be the primary means of political decision-making going forward into the future.
But I think that will soon change. Democracy will be abandoned, and with it the ability to perform political-arbitrage on complex issues like this.
It will be replaced by things like autarchy--rule of the self by the self, you each person has total control over their legal circumstances. A form of extreme self-ownership where each person is a sovereign, without being forced to accept laws by the voting collective.

But are they inextricably part of government? We must conclude they are not, because even now we have private security companies filling much the same role as state-sponsored police, and similarly we have private arbitration services filling much the same role and courts.
Absent government sponsored police or courts, these market based solutions to the same problem would step in to fill the gap just as easily and naturally.


Police and courts will, just as they do now, only they'll be private companies competing for customers, rather than government monopolies with captive customers *cough* I mean, citizens.


Nope, they'll remain independent and simply follow the law, since if they're corrupt people won't buy their services. Checkout "Machinery of Freedom" by David Friedman, free copy on his site.


Again, they exist *now*... in our very own society.


No one needs "authority" to step a crime in progress, do they? Free market police would have the same moral and ethical standing as a private citizen when it came to breaking up crime. This is actually a good thing. They would simply be specialists at it.
In the same way that a cop can use a gun to stop a robbery, so can a private citizen--so then a private police officer can do the same.
It would actually be an improvement over the current situation because currently state police have certain legal exemptions and privileges that they should not have, the ability to violate your rights in ways that they should not have. Free market police would not have the right to stop and pat you down, for instance, nor to search you on whim.
Anyone can ethically use defensive coercion to stop aggressive coercion. We don't need a specially privileged government police force to do that.

That's using aggressive force, and unethical. There's no difference between stealing yourself and voting as a part of a group to steal something from the guy who has fewer votes than you! You're endorsing something completely unethical here!


Socialists have long misunderstood economic theory. Automation doesn't eliminate jobs it only makes them more productive, which increases everyone's standard of living. And increasing automation requires larger and larger capital expenditures, investments.
If welfare benefits collapse that's government failure, not market failure.


Only people can decide. Whom do you suppose could do them apart from people?


But everyone is still subservient to the will of the majority. In an individualist society, no one would be able to force decisions upon anyone else, not even a majority! And that would be far more ethical, since it means a voluntary society rather than one market by the violence and force of democracy.


I am an-cap, but in no way am I for direct democracy, for that is a violation of the will of the owner over their own property. I am for property owners controlling their property 100%, not automatically giving society a say in what they do with their property via a vote, any kind of vote.


Autarchy: rule of the self by the self. It's quite different in character from democracy, because democracy is inherently collectivist in nature, and autarchy is inherently individualist. But of the two, only autarchy is purely ethical. And thus, it will win.

Well, I used Coinbase.com. You don't need a client, no, unless you want to store your wallet on your own harddrive. Checkout for more info on wallet options.
Coinbase does a bankdraft off your account. Takes about 3 days to setup an account with Coinbase and do account verification. From then you can buy instantly, locking in the current market price, and the deal takes 5 days to close, in order for the bank-draft to go through and the reversibility window to close (not Coinbase's fault).

I think we can stop worrying about a 51% attack by enemies of bitcoin any time soon. Mining needs to remain profitable or else it will collect into fewer and fewer hands, thus making the centralization problem worse, not better. This product, as far as I can tell, doesn't help secure the network.
I don't see why there has to be a dichotomy between securing the network and making financial sense. People shouldn't have to donate money to bitcoin as a whole to run miners. If mining isn't financially self-supportive, bitcoin's doomed long-term.
But of course, mining is profitable generally, but these devices simply won't be at this price point.

But such self-chosen law could only exist on their own property, and they could not extend it to others' property.
So, if one accepted a law making killing legal in all circumstance, he himself would be subject to recourseless murder 24/7 while on his property, and no one else would agree to set foot on his property due to such a stupid law.
So who would he be harming? He'd be the only one likely to get killed.


You've judged too quickly. It can be done. It will be done. It must be done. 
It's a fairly radical change from how we do things now, but actually a continuation of historical legal direction, from total centralization, to decentralization in a series of centers and congresses and representatives, to now individual self-representation and legal self-determination.

Unlikely, since bitcoin may serve all of future humanity and that constitutes a lot of transactions improved by bitcoin.
Also, we don't know how long it will take to increase in price. Similarly, we don't know how many of the 11 million coins have actually been retained in control by the original owners. They weren't valuable back then and every week someone admits they lost them back when they were worthless. I myself lost less than 1 bitcoin mining way back when that I don't have control of now.
Secondly, of those which are controlled, they will be dispersed over time by purchases and inheritance through generations.

I agree with this, but the problem is that paper is not durable enough to survive decades reliably.

It's as safe as you can keep it physically.
I'd hate to see people losing coins to a simple housefire. And despite what you're told, I wouldn't trust paper to even a fireproof safe. In tests of such safes, papers inside were often left burned nonetheless.

Now here, I'd say, you have prices rising, which is one way of measuring inflation, but not due to actual inflation, which I'm defining as always an increase in the quantity of money.
But price tracking is how inflation is measured, so it gets lumped in with that. But perhaps others would not agree with my view on this point, and I'm willing to accept that.
In this case, the marginal utility of certain goods exceeds that of holding money for the average person and they shed holdings for hard goods. But since I define inflation as innately due to the quantity of money, I'd say the purchasing power of money hasn't decreased (hasn't been inflated) so much as the value of the goods people want to buy has greatly increased. It's not that money is worth less (inflation) it's that the desired goods are worth relatively more. The amount of money actually held never actually decreases, someone always owns it, so to say demand for money has gone down isn't accurate. More people are simply choosing certain goods than current cash accounts than before.
People normally conflate these two effects as inflation, but I disagree.
And this can be seen by comparing the general basket of goods. Money is only a medium of exchange, each good could be priced in terms of each other.
In true inflation, you'd see a general price increase among the total basket of goods.
In supply shock, minus inflation, you'll see a price increase in a set basket of goods desirable to that situation with a fairly stationary price for other goods less desirable. Ie: in case of faminine, the price of steel may actually go down. Thus I would not call this an instance of inflation just because the price of food went up dramatically. Because the price increase was not caused by a change in the quantity of money.


This touches on what I was trying to explain before, that these things happen without 'inflation' as many people understand it actually happening. Supply shocks happening and prices going up here and there can simply reflect changes in demand or market blips. I'm an advocate of viewing inflation purely as a monetary phenomena, and those instances fall outside the scope of that. And I'd say it's unfortunate that people conflate these other effects as inflation purely because the typical method of measuring inflation is by price tracking.
The true measure of inflation is how many bills are being printed and destroyed with time (and equivalents such as credit expansions via interest rate, etc.).

One day I'd like to see oil priced in bitcoin. That's not possible with a 21m limit on BTC priced at $1 per, bitcoin in that case couldn't handle the kinds of large transactions required for pricing in oil, which regularly involves transfers in the many billions.
Bitcoin's market cap must increase for certain kinds of market activity to adopt bitcoin, including oil transfers.
So, I see the advance of market cap and liquidity to be vital to its future adoption as a worldwide currency, and have to disagree in the main with you.
If you're simply saying that price is immaterial to exchange, that's true, unless the exchange, as I point out, is priced so high that bitcoin doesn't have the liquidity to facilitate it, in which case higher priced is absolutely necessary.
For instance, what if Intel wanted to buy a new $2b chip fab in bitcoin. They'd have to buy bitcoin worth what is currently the entire market cap. It would be a world-changing event for bitcoin causing the price to fly, but who knows if the price would remain at that level, and the price disruption would be just as bad when they cashed out back into fiat.
We need more market cap.

You can profitably invest in anything with a limited supply for which you expect higher future demand. That will translate into a higher price.

Seriously. Knowing the math and the emotional psychology of gambling is what makes it easy for me to say no to it.
1. You're guaranteed to lose long-term.
2. The thrill of the unknown future, of winning and losing back and forth, taps into human nature and creates an emotional rollercoaster that is in itself addicting.
If you gamble, you're putting your money into a place where the odds are against you to earn a return.
If you invest money, you're putting your money in a place where the odds are in your favor.

The only difference between you and a libertarian/ancap is that we've discovered the difference between government and governance. 
Everything the government provides is governance, and governance is necessary to a society--and we agree-things like law production, courts / dispute resolution, and police to enforce law.
But don't you dislike monopolies? We do. Monopolies are bad because they have no competition and thus charge the highest monopoly price while offering the lowest possible service.
We realized that governments hold a monopoly on certain services which they are associated with, the services of governance.
In fact they've convinced the majority of people that only they can provide these services.
Yet, these services are provided by people to people, and people can be in any kind of organization, not just a government organization.
You can just as easily have non-government organizations provide law, courts, and police.
And it would actually be better, because it would be both cheaper and better service, and also because they wouldn't be able to ignore the law like the government does now.
If you like that bitcoin takes power away from issuing authorities (in the US government), what you're really saying is that you like that bitcoin is disrupting the government monopoly on money which it is abusing by inflating massively.
It's obviously against your interest for the monopolist authorities to inflate the money supply, but you don't yet see that it's against your interest for them to monopolize law, courts, and police.
But, we libertarians intend to show you that it is against your interest by offering you a choice. And actually these solutions have been up and running for years. There are more private security guards in the USA than police officers. And the majority of business disputes are handled by arbitration today, not by government courts.
All that's left then is private law and then moving to a non-government jurisdiction and everything will be in place for libertarian society to flourish totally free of government intervention, and then we'll all have a true choice.

I suggest such security services would have zero power to set any law in the society I propose. All law is created by individuals and police only enforce them. Of course the police could refuse to enforce for clients who have dumb laws, but that's another matter entirely.


This is actually false. Markets tend towards competition. It's the collusion between business and government that creates oligopolies by building legal barriers to entry and the like. Remove government and the oligopolies would cease to exist in time.
When business was first getting started, the first monopolies came about when businessmen would pay the king for an exclusive grant to operate a certain business without competition in an area.
If the market tended toward oligopoly, why would they bother bribing the king for a monopoly grant? They didn't think they would get an monopoly or an oligopoly, they thought they would face competition. You're judging a non-free market with massive government manipulation throughout it and then blaming the free market as if that's what we had, but that's not what we have. You should learn where the intersection of government and the market is what's really causing that which you despise.


Not at all, since the government has power to coerce, and in a free market no one has power to coerce at all.


No one customer can account for all their profits, not even a majority. Even if they were to be bribed, it's unlikely the bribe would be worth more than they'd be sued for later on for what they're bribed to do. And, if it gets out they've been bribed, they'd suffer awesome reputational damage and likely fold as a company, losing all their other clients, etc.


Because the phone market is not a free market.


They would have no more opportunity than they have now. In fact they would have less, since they would have no politicians to bribe for favors.
It would be far better for everyone.


It's derived from one's natural rights of self-ownership. So, any dispute resolution provider.

A metaphoric 'war on bitcoin' akin to the drug war is unlikely because of the collateral damage to other digital goods that the gov doesn't want attacked.
Essentially bitcoin is a digital commodity. Start a war on bitcoin and it will leak into other digital commodities. Suddenly people will be asking if Amazoncoin is illegal, whether WoW gold is illegal, whether any digital good is illegal.
The one thing they don't want to do is kill the online golden-goose by overstepping legally. The second thing they don't want to do is make the legal system look like a joke by criminalizing that which they can't enforce, ala torrent downloads. There's no analogous case for bitcoin tho, there's no IP being 'stolen' or w/e.
We've already seen the FBI report on bitcoin, and as far as moneylaundering, tax evasion and the like they expect they can catch people at the point of conversion between bitcoin and dollars.
As long as they have that they aren't worried, and FinCen means they have that. 
In cases of market disruption, the thing being disrupted usually isn't concerned about the disruptor, it doesn't realize it's being disrupted. That's been replicated here.
Bitcoin can supplant the dollar by becoming so widespread that it turns into the unit of account, and then people would only buy dollars to pay taxes. Hard to imagine that right now, but it's one possible scenario.

It is beneficial to the borrower, and also unfair to the lender. I suggest a situation where no one gets screwed is better than where someone does.
We have it this way now because borrowers far outnumbers lenders when it comes to voting, thus the borrowers have tilted laws in their favor.
The lenders make up for it with contractual stipulations and charging higher interest, so it ultimately balances out, but it would still be better for it to be upfront and fair for everyone rather than forcing lenders to be less than scrupulous about contractual terms because borrowers want to think they're screwing the lenders by using inflationary money.

2. As for help from others, he was, as he admits, standing on the shoulders of giants. There have been plenty of crypto ideas he borrowed. His innovation was the block-chain concept. And it was vastly improved by professional programmers once they got ahold of his code. He didn't invent hashing, or a multitude of other things in bitcoin now.
Calling it a 'first try' is a bit silly, since there've been ecash attempts for over 20 years now. He didn't need to invent SHA256 or ECDSA, etc., etc. And as for the actual programming, he stuck to an established standard that was known to be hardened against attack--ie: using almost no buffers, thus no buffer overflow attacks possible.

That's not what deflationary means. Bitcoin is deflationary because its supply is strictly limited and because demand is going to outstrip supply forever. So yes, technically bitcoin -is- inflating right now, new coins are being added to the overall supply, but the rate of new coin creation is fixed and eventually ends. It's not like a fiat currency where some power can just decide to print billions of fiat overnight.


True, but that doesn't mean the fractions are suddenly worth the same amounts or something. Because the future will have both more people and more wealth, there'll always be more people chasing a static amount of bitcoin and more wealth being exchanged in a static amount of bitcoin, and that means it will experience continual deflation.
It is true that the easy subdivisibility of bitcoin means this won't be a problem likely ever, because, as you say, we can just begin transacting in smaller decimals. Fiat currency isn't as easy to do that in.




It just means deflation won't be a problem insofar as subdivisibility goes.
Gold actually has this problem. The reason gold wasn't use for everything (ie: they used silver) is that once you cut gold small enough it becomes hard to track. Imagine trying to buy a nickel's worth of screws for a piece of gold. It'd have to be practically microscopic :P So they used less valuable metals.
Bitcoin doesn't have this problem at all, obviously (which is also why the litecoin claim of being 'silver to bitcoin's gold' fails, bitcoin doesn't need a less valuable adjunct currency the way gold genuinely did).


Sounds about right.


Nah, 'deflation' is exactly what it will experience, that's the proper term. Deflation doesn't refer at all to the problem of subdivisibility, thus no need to change the term and confuse people. It's just a deflationary currency that doesn't face the same divisibility problem that other currencies would.

is a great place for these questions too, and has a lot of info generally :)


In QT the private key is stored in the wallet and you're not expected to access it. This is because a QT wallet is a piece of technology itself, capable of storing hundreds or thousands of key-pairs, and in that case you wouldn't be expected to deal with the private key at all. It's possible to extract the private key of each address in a wallet, but it's not something a normal person is expected to ever do. Just treat access to your wallet file like your private key in terms of information security and they're functionally the same thing.


Yes, and it does things like auto-generate new addresses, because when you spend from an address, you actually spend the entire balance and receive the rest as 'change', so QT will generate a new address to receive that change to, to further obscure tracking of who owns what.


You don't have to know, the wallet treats all your collected balances as a single available amount of spends behind the scenes as needed automatically.
If you really want to have and know what has what balance, the easiest way is to send money to a paper wallet, since it's only and always just a single key-pair.


Actually you don't want that at all. Even in cold storage it'd be wise to keep a few wallets separate, not all your eggs in one basket.


Only as safe as your security practices and how much russian roulette you want to play. I keep only a very small balance on this machine, less than 1 btc, and I have very good security. You have to figure you will eventually be hacked and plan accordingly. You can't reasonably plan to just never be hacked.

Where there's profit to be made there's guaranteed competition.
If ASICMiner wanted they could put a large amount of power in separate pools and thus avoid 51% themselves. They could deploy more than 50% of the network's hashing rate that way and not worry about 51% since they're not controlling the pools, although that might still make people wary.
With KNC coming online, a large amount of non-ASICminer power will be ready to rival them. Their unique position is, as I said, a function of both bitcoin's youth and the newness of the ASIC strategy.

It's unlikely making gold via nuclear collision will ever be cost effective to the price of gold.
It would likely be far cheap to prospect for gold on other planets and in asteroids than to make it via nuclear fusion.
And that won't make gold valueless, it'll just bring gold down to the cost of manufacture via that method. Since the price of gold would likely have to rise a couple orders of magnitude at least for fusion to be cost effective, that would likely equal a much higher cost of gold than what we see today.
Gold is unlikely to fail as a medium of exchange, but its price is likely to change, certainly. But it's always going to be scarce.

Hmm, I've not seen people throw around the "mathematically impossible" language in my own studies of the subject. I've seen instead an economic argument, that it would be more expensive than it's worth, that if conducted there's also an existential risk for the attacker that the attack could be very easily defeated or somehow found a way to just ignore it, which would mean millions of dollars of hardware immediately scrapped due to what would amount to an ingenius idea plus a few hours of actual coding.
I have heard that it would be possible to, for instance, change the SHA256 algorithm if we ever discovered a problem with it or the like. We could perhaps do that immediately. We could call that the nuclear option :P
It's not a very good option because it would scrap existing ASICs supporting the blockchain...

I'd be more worried about the people that start hyperventilating when the price drops $5. The rest of us know price fluctuation is normal and expect a long-term rising-price trend. This isn't because of cult-like behavior or thinking, but for good reasons, such as bitcoin's value proposition as a currency with the lowest possible transaction costs, and the strictly limited number of coin available, and its relative obscurity. Put that together you have potential for a huge breakout long-term.

The source of law in an autarchy is two things: individual choice, and agreements made between owners. And I'll explain.
You own yourself and any property you have. You will set all the laws for yourself and your property.
If anyone wants to visit your property, you'll have them agree to live by your law-set for that property or else not enter the property.
Similarly, if you visit another's property, you'll agree to their law-set--much like a usage agreement when you install a software product. These laws will be legitimately enforceable and people will have to take them seriously.
Anyone in violation of a law on property can have police called on them and be sued in court for redress under the law they agreed to.
So you see there, you have complete control over yourself and your property, but must compromise to leave your property. However others will want visitors (ie: businesses) so you can be sure they will make visitor-friendly and fair laws. There will also be competition among such businesses for favorable laws.
In the end people would tend to coalesce into communities of agreement, where people have in large groups accepted similar law-sets and can roam freely with assumed agreements to a certain point.
To make this seamless, we use cellphones running a location-based app that can serve law-sets correlated to GPS coordinates. Any place you've already signed the usage agreement by visiting before will be carried over to your next visit. If not, you're presented with an agreement to look over and sign.
The result is a society where no one is subject to the will of the collective, there are no politicians and thus no political graft or tyranny and no possibility of it either, where each person controls utterly the legal circumstances they wish to live in on their own property and can negotiate legal terms for visiting others' property. This has been called a situation of 'polycentric law.'
Division of labor would exist as a matter of course since such a society, being inherently tax free, would be a major business haven.
If people want to get something done as a community in the same way that governments are used to do it now, say by building a needed bridge, they'd do it by proposing the plan, taking voluntary donations or subscriptions towards the plan (replacing involuntary taxation with voluntary donations and subscriptions) and then become shareholders in the eventual organization that then builds, cares for, and distributes profits from the bridge's use, should there be any.

The key is that bitcoin makes it profitable to leave a money-system where government action is stealing value from those who hold dollars.
Before bitcoin you had no easy way to escape this system, buying hard assets was the only way, and hard assets like gold and silver, are very difficult to use as money at all. They typically have to be converted back to cash to be used so.
Bitcoin gives us a virtually 'hard asset' to escape into that is also easy to use as money, permanently.

If you think everything illegal is automatically criminal, you've got a lot of thinking to do.
The foundation of law is ethics. If something is not unethical, it should not be illegal either.
Remember MLK saying "an unjust law is no law at all" and a law that seeks to make the ethical unethical is equally an unjust law.
If you try to divorce law from ethics the result inevitably is the Nazi excuse for killing the Jews: "It was legal."
How did that work out for them? They still hung.
Please learn what the connection is between ethics and law and stop spouting an ignorant viewpoint like this.

Yep, sold all my google stock and put it into bitcoin except what little I need to pay immediate expenses.
Wasn't much, I'm young, several thousands, but this was back at the $30 range. I did it because I'd been arguing the economic theory of money on the Mises.org forums for months in regards to bitcoin and became convinced that it was an excellent money with a compelling value proposition and was likely to succeed on the long-term. 
While many people are speculating without the benefit of understand the theory behind bitcoin, actually understanding it makes bitcoin seem far less risky I think. 
It's not really a question to me of whether bitcoin will succeed or not, it's more how long and which one (which version of bitcoin).
Obviously the community at large has focused on this bitcoin--what we simply call 'bitcoin' (as opposed to litecoin and the other altcurrencies), and I've seen compelling arguments for why bitcoin is likely to remain dominant (network effect, path dependence).
As for the business proposition, bitcoin offers the lowest transaction costs of all currencies for online and distance transactions.
This seems a subtle or technical point, I think, and so feel that many without an understanding of business or economics will tend to discount it or overlook it, but it's a compelling case for retailers.
Any time you can lower your prices -and- make more profit while being paid in a deflating currency rather than an inflating one, chances are you're going to choose to do so.
Since bitcoin supply is limited and the compelling business case means that demand is likely to increase dramatically as more people learn about the currency, it was an easy conclusion that the time to invest is *yesterday*. 
The only major risk I see is how quickly bitcoin can revolutionize online payments and spread. Could be rapid, could be slow, could be inhibited by legislation of some sort, who knows. But long term, the idea of bitcoin is a cat out of the bag and it will succeed because of lower transaction costs of being a digital native over physical fiat, since in the future most transactions will have a digital component, even ones taking place in brick&amp;mortar stores, in person.

It's true that this is the case, in a way. It's a little bit like the guy who bought the very first fax machine, isn't it? :P
But that will come with time. Especially since both buyers and sellers can avoid the 3-4% credit card fee that the big companies charge, and can do so without chargebacks as well or fraud-charges. That's actually pretty huge incentive to begin accepting bitcoin.
As for buying things generally, you can now [Buy anything from any website with bitcoin.](
But it's not native, I know. However we've seen significant uptake on native bitcoin processing as well, with Reddit and Wordpress taking Bitcoin as well as a host of smaller sites, ala Bitcoinstore.com.
Bitcoin is not widely accepted, but uptake is on the rise. No innate reason to think it won't continue.


Well, it's not directly analogous, but there's this recently as well: 
[I just paid for Beer and Hamburger with Bitcoin](
Eventually we may see a mad rush **into** accepting bitcoin. It's actually pretty easy to implement.


Government backing is why it's unstable. The government could at any moment print millions of dollars a minute--oh wait, that's already happening :P It's if they choose to print billions a minute that things get scary. Did you hear about the proposal to print a trillion dollar coin? These are the idiots running the US currency.
Decentralization of bitcoin is a huge strength by contrast.
As for volatility, honestly I believe it's market cap that leads to that more than anything, market cap and distribution of funds. Early on at the 2011 crash, most bitcoins were in very few hands comparatively. Now they are in widespread hands generally, certainly far more than in 2011.
Bitcoin's rapid rise lately would be a problem in a bitcoin-native economy, but such rises are historic, they don't happen often. Mostly you're going to see stability.


I see no reason to assume such volatility would last! The price increases correspond to the block-reward halving and a resulting supply crunch. We can expect another one in 2017 when the reward halves again!


This isn't true (anymore). There exist clients that can refer to servers that have the blockchain cached for this info, and thus don't need to sync and are ready to go instantly.


Or something like bitinstant, which is like 30 minutes. Coinbase takes a couple days. Agreed it's a problem, but it's just about the same problem to switch any two currencies like dollars into yen.


There's no innate reason why you couldn't go directly to a site like Amazon and buy a bitcoin on their page and have it sent to an online wallet like Blockchain spending five minutes or less!
In fact, maybe there's a business opportunity there for someone. Access is an issue, but it's primarily an issue now and should be much less so later.


True. I'd say the bigger barrier is non-techie security for 'norms'. We need hardware wallets to come out. Then we need to be able to sell bitcoin through something like a Google-Play App and send it to your chosen wallet, etc. Make it easy.

IOUs are backed by human entities. Assets are "backed" by physical limitations and constraints (ie: scarcity and the in-economy of using fusion to produce more of that element, nor mine more off-planet). Bitcoin is "backed" by crypto and mathematical limitations and constraints.
With the IOU, you're relying on an institution's honesty to keep the IOU good. It's riskier than an asset which relies on impersonal facts about the universe and about mathematics to maintain value store.
People don't like to think of hard assets in these terms as if they were entirely of a different character--they're really not. Value depends on scarcity, the non-scarce is also non-valued. Just human beings are a lot more likely to cheat than reality, thus the IOU is far riskier.
For IOUs, value is derived from institutional integrity; they'll promise not to issue more IOUs than they have assets (ideally, of course this usually doesn't happen and instead becomes the fraud of fractional reserve).
For hard assets, it's the difficulty of physical duplication.
For bitcoin, is the facts of mathematical cryptography and the protection of inconceivable and incredibly large numbers.

Of course they would. Human beings are whom organize and do everything. Do you think the government isn't made up of human beings?
The only difference between government people and normal people is the ability to coerce legally. You don't need coercion to build a damn street. And streets are cheap compared to building a chip fab, did we need the government to build $2b Intel chip fabs? Nope.


It has a function but not a necessary function. Everything it does could be replaced by free market services. The government desires relevance and legitimacy above all, and thus reserves to itself a few monopolies, on roads, police, and courts, etc.
But there's no innate reason why the gov should run these except that it likes to in order to protect itself and further its own power.

I did the math once. If the entire world, today, switched to bitcoin, that would represent a GDP of $70 trillion worldwide. If we assume the market cap was the same number, a roughly reasonable assumption considering the amount of dollars in existence compared to US GDP ($10t+ to $12t), then three ten-millionths of a bitcoin would have to equal today's $1.
Or, 0.00,000,3 = today's $1, or 1 btc = today's $3 million &gt;_&gt;
Naturally, it's gonna take on the order of 50-100 years minimum for the world economy to switch over to the obviously superior bitcoin, and GDP will be higher by then as well.
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:36:07
Bitcoin has a compelling value proposition: lowest transaction costs.
Whereas a credit card transaction costs between 2% - 5%, a bitcoin transaction costs mere pennies regardless of amount transferred.
This is a far cry from mere digital hats. And it's why bitcoin is going nowhere except up.
The intelligent are often also very pigheaded :P 
You should look into the theory of money, that's what clinches bitcoin's value. Unfortunately most people don't study economics, much less the philosophy of money.
But bitcoin makes a fantastic money when considered in that light! Even better than gold as a money.

That's only one risk of centralization, to my mind. Centrally issued schemes can work with a distributed ledger but there's absolutely no reason to do so in that case. The whole point of the block chain concept is to allow decentralized transaction tracking, to reduce or eliminate the need for 3rd party trust. If you're going to centralize there's easier and cheaper ways to do the same thing, but they also don't engender trust.

Unless you would've spent the money in dollars anyway. People still have to live and spend now.
If anything people would be spending far more money in bitcoin if they could buy everything in bitcoin, because there's advantages to using bitcoin, including price advantages.
But it won't make real sense to buy everything in bitcoin unless you're being paid in bitcoin already. Well, it makes sense, but it's not quite as easy and native.
To the mind of a person right now, whether they spend $20 on a pizza or first buy $20 in bitcoin and spend bitcoin, either way that's $20 they were always going to spend. Thus the lost value in bitcoin price increases matters not at all to them, it's not bitcoin they were ever going to keep.
People wouldn't spend out of their savings in bitcoin, since it's going up and they don't need it to live, that's for sure.

Hardly, all you can do is throw them out of office every few years. You can't make them pass any policies you like or don't like. You can't stop them from forcing laws on you. You basically give them carte blanche unless they get caught doing something blatantly illegal.


They find one in the next city over, or the next. It's not really that likely that they could reject them ad infinitum is it?


Only compared to lawlessness. But I'm not proposing lawlessness, just a different methodology for achieving law and order. I do not propose the end of law, I propose a new mechanism for creating law. I do not propose the end of court dispute resolution, only a different basis for it to occur. I want the same ends you think government provides only I've found a way to achieve them without giving anyone a legal monopoly on force in a region.
And that's good, because a tyrant needs a monopoly on coercion to do things like pass discriminatory laws against races. Chances are it wouldn't happen in a society where no one has the power to oppress anyone legally. Chances are it would be far more impossible than with any government.

But digital purchases also occur in person and are the majority of all transactions in all stores. When you use a credit card, you have a POS system going online to complete that transaction. I guess I figured that was obvious.


Gold has a number of negatives as a currency. It's heavy. It requires significant training to be able to determine its purity at point of sale, a ratio of volume to weight. It can be far more easily faked than bitcoin. And it's not easily divisible to smaller units. A $1 gold coin would be microscopic for instance :P Most people have preferred gold tokens like receipts rather than trading actual gold for some of these reasons.
Using bitcoin, you can easily verify that a bitcoin is authentic using known math, far quicker, easier, faster than authenticating gold, and with far less error or chance of being defrauded.
Bitcoin is far more easily divisible, less susceptible to supply inflation (huge gold deposits could be discovered at any time, who knows), weights infinitely less even in large amounts and thus is both cheaper and easier to transport securely.
There's a number of advantages. But even over gold, bitcoin has lower transaction costs for in-person transactions simply because most places today aren't equipped to transact in gold.

Oh yeah, you might be right about that. Good point. We can actually know how much bitcoin is being traded each day as it's public on the blockchain, and from that derive a figure.

All collusive tactics involve trying to extract more money from consumers than they're willing to pay, so when the prices rise and profits rise that attracts competition.
The only time this works without inviting new market competitors to undercut the collusive companies is when government can be convinced to provide legal cover.
For instance, the government overcharges for mail carrying because they've given themselves a legal monopoly on it.

That situation cannot be avoided while you have a government. It's democracy-arbitrage, where one side realizes it can use the power of law to force wealth out of the minority. So it's not that the majority don't want their rights defended--they do--it's that the majority also realizes they can vote to violate the minority's rights with total impunity. Yet another reason why democracy must be done away with.


I think it would quickly find itself out of funds. And then someone would start a new government promising to do X better than the old one, and now you've got competing governments suddenly :P Does the original one then put down the new upstart and demand donations go to it? What gives it legitimacy? If everyone stops donating and it goes bankrupt, what happens to it?


All mass action in ancap would be finance by voluntary-donation or investment. The difference is, you'd become a stockholder in the new corporation so donated to. Not so different as you imagine I think.


Actually if you were tried for that and he was found guilty after all and sentenced to a few months in prison, then you wouldn't be found guilty of violating his rights at all, it would've been found a just act after the fact. I think you're on the wrong track to solving the problem I pose, but let's see if this goes anywhere...


I think you're assuming the competing group carries out justice on their own. No one said police and courts were conflated. The competing group would apprehend criminals and bring them to 3rd party courts, along with evidence, to be tried and dealt with. How then does your original government court convict this competing group of anything???


That's not well thought-through. If X takes Y to court, the two would have to agree on an independent court. X doesn't get to just choose his allied court whom he's paid off to always rule in his favor, Y would simply veto that court's involvement. The most basic rule of justice is that the judge be independent!
So, this is a non-issue.

Yes, not even the right to tax in the first place. I suggest that one has an inalienable right to the product of their labor, and that even if a majority of other people decide to take your money from you, ie: taxation, that such is not legitimate unless you consent to it.
If you withdraw consent for that action, the action becomes not taxation but theft at the point of a gun.
There is nothing about a large group of people voting one way or the other which legitimates using force to take from anyone the product of their labor, anymore than if a whole country voted to invade a smaller country that that could be considered legitimate.
In other terms, it should be recognized that one cannot delegate a power that one does not have. A representative government represents the people. But individual people do not have the right to simply decide to take money from other people, that is always theft. Thus such an action cannot be delegated to government by the people, as it is not a right the people possess.

And absent that force it's likely companies would likely choose to make that info public as a matter of policy, in order to build trust and provide transparency and legitimacy. Those companies that didn't would experience less trust and thus less investment generally.
In any case, even if they didn't choose to expose that they could never hide the result of their trading activity on the market. Seeing sudden price movements and sales would clue in others that something's up, and someone knows something.


I think there's a difference between characterizing the important thing *about a market* and what's important about specific markets.
The most important thing about the free market is that prices transmit information.
To the uninitiated in economics that probably goes right over their head, however it's the most important thing to understand about pricing generally and has very many implications.
And one of those implications is that legislation blocking the transmittal of price-information, eg: insider trading laws, foils that most important aspect of markets.
Even in the context of stocks and bonds, while investment is important, you still need price as a signal to winnow between stocks and bonds, good ones and bad ones.
It's doubtful that stocks and bonds could even exist without prices in the first place.

The US is not the end-all be-all market for bitcoin either.
Lots of countries would also love to get off the dollar standard, and might see bitcoin as a way to accomplish that.
Imagine a day where barrels of oil are priced in bitcoin rather than dollars. It's not an impossibility at all in the longer term. We know the middle east would love to get off dollar pricing but just can't seem to do it.
Bitcoin has more legitimacy than the dollar precisely because it's uncontrolled and uncontrollable. Even a US envoy on buying and selling bitcoins wouldn't stop their international use, and would actually help fan the flames of usage of Bitcoin the world 'round, because it would make huge news, and give incentive to those who want to hurt the dollar to use Bitcoin.
Then you might see countries that consider themselves forward thinking technologically actually adopt bitcoin alongside their national currency, or even try pegging to bitcoin rather than the dollar (not that that would last). Alternately the people of a region might simply latch onto bitcoin during a period of economic uncertainty caused by their government, ala modern Argentina and Venezuela, and mass uptake would lead to lasting and penetrating uptake until it supplants the national currency.
There's a lot that could happen still. And even if the US ultimately moves against bitcoin, it won't be able to defeat it long-term.

Well maybe a bad example.
But the idea is that the network effect makes something more value because other people have already bought into it.
Thus HP has cultural value to experiencing it that a clone series wouldn't. You could talk about, bond over shared HP experiences--not so much with the clone series that would be far less well known.
Then there's path dependence. The fact that others have historically picked bitcoin makes it more likely for others to pick, because of the infrastructure built around it, because of acceptance of it thus far, etc.
And lastly is categorical uniqueness. Bitcoin can do things cash can't do because cash is physical and bitcoin is digital. Any altcoin competitor to bitcoin is also digital and can have no advantage that couldn't be replicated with bitcoin easily enough. Paper can never be digital tho.
For this and more reasons, nothing stop someone from releasing another cryptocurrency, they exist in large numbers already, but they aren't likely to gain traction for these and other reasons.

Actually this makes the burden far easier. You only have to comply with your local laws and then attach yourself to their organization which is already compliant with the rest. Then to do work from X place to Y, you simply involve local compliant X in the deal to yourself in Y. Done and done.
That way X and Y only need to be compliant locally to them, rather than either X or Y being compliant everywhere. You're buying into their compliant framework no matter where you are.
At least that's how it seems to suggest it would work to me. It could work.

Both the US and China are among the largest countries in the world. Both have about 3.7 million miles^2 of land area.
The Pacific Ocean has 63.8 million miles^2 of unclaimed territory. With seasteading all of this can be colonized, including under the sea potentially. Beyond that, we will one day be able to own space, spacesteading, opening up ownership from two-dimensions to three dimensions and there will be no end to available real-estate in space.


It is however illegitimate as it is against my will, without consent.


When a government obtains office, they have an immediate monopoly on power for their term, and practically nothing can dislodge them.
But with a business, who keeps them fair is the competition next door. No matter what else they may want to do, they know that if they don't please their customers they will be gone tomorrow.
Businesses on the market are far more responsive to the people generally than political organizations will ever be.
Reminds me of a little story.
A man went to a department store, it was Black Friday, to buy his mother a gift. It was a mad-house in there, lines at the registers were long, and when he finally got to the till he remarked on the line and the cashier, frantic with trying to help customers and ring up the orders, said, "I know, it's the best day we've ever had!"
The man then took his gift to the post-office to mail to his sister for Christmas, and there too the lines were long, the clerks, frantic and annoyed, helped customers and when he got to the front he remarked on how busy it was and the clerk looked at him and said, "I know, it's the worst day we've ever had." :P
Businesses must please customers to make a profit. The system of state-capitalism we live in now actually allows corps to cement themselves in market position using government regs and the like. That's when companies begin screwing people. Without those pseudo-monopolies they'd be forced to once again cater closely to the customer or lose market position.


Most people in a free society would contract on an individual or group basis with private security companies to provide protection, essentially providing police protection. It's likely that part of this would include a war-insurance provision, where a small amount of your fee goes towards war prep. In case of war, these individual security companies would likely band together into a unified force to expel the attacker.


If a society saw the need to create a military force they do not need government to do it. They only need will, organization, and money. Thus let's say your scenario happens, a voluntary organization springs up, headed by an ex special-forces let's say, and he proposes the build a military protection force for X region.
If the people feel sufficiently threatened to desire this protection, they can give his org monthly voluntary payments on a continuing basis of whatever amount they desire. As for free riders, he could setup the org such that the payments trigger only if everyone chips in, thus free riders are taken care of, an all or nothing proposition.
Then he would quite simply build a force akin to any government military.
But the key is that, if the people felt that threat had gone away they could now voluntarily remove their funding and that military capital would be forced to downsize or disband entirely.

Bitcoin is the best currency, yes currency, for online and distance transactions because it offers the lowest possible transactions costs.
Any suggestion that 'increasing supply of currency when there's high demand for currency' is a good thing is keynesian economic idiocy. When there's high demand for currency its price increases, you do not need and should not create more currnecy to meet a supposed demand for currency.
People don't demand currency, they demand goods; currency is only a means to that end.
One of the necessary features of a good currency is value store, and the idea of "increasing monetary supply" has the effect of destroying value store via inflation.
Bitcoin is volatile because it is young, low market cap, etc. That won't always be the case.
But don't make the mistake of thinking it isn't or can't be a currency. 
Bitcoin will be truly a currency when you use it as your unit of account.
If bitcoin could never be a currency it would be impossible to use it as a unit account ever. However there are people being paid in bitcoin right now, and whom try to do all their living-expense spending in bitcoin, and for them it is a unit of account.

You make the mistake of believing that bitcoin valuation is driven by news cycle. This is not the case and never has been. While news can drive overvaluation and market exuberance, bitcoin has legitimate value too.

There's a small chance it will sustain itself, very, very small chance, so I think it's a good move. We seem to be riding a wave of enthusiasm and awakening to bitcoin, in part driven by worldwide currency fears. 
Google trends rating 'bitcoin' search at 96 out of 100 on the peak enthusiasm scale right now:

Are you using the browser plugin? Always use the browser plugin?
But even then, only trust a 3rd party with minute amounts of bitcoin you intend to spend right away.
Whenever there's an issue with a service, don't try to log-in and get your coins out, wait for the smoke to clear or risk becoming part of the problem or taken by it.
Blockchain.info is one of the best in this regard. If they go down, I've got my encrypted backup still.

It's impossible to say that with certainty, first of all.
And what market reaction do you imagine this person trying to evince?
The effect an actual wall would have is to slow the price-gain, to tamper down over-enthusiasm and prevent exuberant-buying that leads to a price-spike. Or to take advantage of exuberant-buying if the wall doesn't stop them. It would take, what, a week of straight buying to beat that price wall if it stays up, thus more like three weeks of buys and sells.
$25 is one of the psychologically-prominent numbers that it's likely those with large caches would use to sell-off a portion of their stores to diversify.

The reason it was created in the first place remains, and always will.

I would agree with this. I put my entire savings into bitcoin months ago, but it really wasn't that much, I'm young, and price fluctuations don't affect me emotionally. 
I feel bad for this guy if he wasn't prepared for the emotional requirement of going in deep.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:44:53
Difficulty adjusts every two weeks, not every 10 min. A block is found ever 10 minutes, that's what that figure corresponds to, which means the network tries to change the diff so that one will be found on average every 10 min.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:04:37
Exchanges just tend to parallel rather naturally, because prices are signals, and some see a big buy on Gox and figure this might be part of a rally, so they buy in, etc.

Late adopters will only be able to use btc as money and not as an investment vehicle. It's use and advantages as money are why it is currently treated by many as an investment vehicle, and those advantages don't change once bitcoin reaches its final price height after mass-adoption.
So, no, I don't expect them to reject bitcoin for that reason. Will some of them be envious, sure. But they should still want bitcoin for its qualities as money.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:55:18

There was one known successful double-spend created during the fork, done as an experiment, non-maliciously. That's the only one I know of. It's not easy. And it's easy to mitigate that risk by waiting for 3 or more confirmations before releasing goods as a seller.

According to one legal opinion I'd read, a bitcoin would only be legit in India if generated on the continent using Indian electricity. So one barrier may be that they'd have to mine any coins they want to use.
But I imagine that barrier would be awfully hard to enforce :P

Why would a variable supply be desirable. You have to explain that first.
This is the same kind of thinking that has caused every hyperinflation in economic history. Read the experience of the French after the French Revolution, where the cry went out that there wasn't enough currency supply out there and they inflated themselves into poverty.
Variable supply is completely unecessary for bitcoin, because it's infinitely divisible. It has an effectively limitless supply. 


Inflation, such as you're advocating here, destroys a currency's ability to function as a medium of account and plays havoc with its ability to function as a medium of exchange. It's supply-constaints make it a prime currency for these two things.
Do you really think Bitcoin was made supply-constrained foolishly? Go read up on Austrian economics. Supply-constraint in a currency is the best thing we could have ever done for the economy.

But no one died. So is he just a really bad criminal, or did he use talk of ordering a hit as a way of slyly silencing the people trying to blackmail him?
And had there been no government aggression in the drug market--a perfectly ethical market--he could not have found himself in that situation. So I blame the gov.

One corporation can't possibly get control of all food production so it's a moot question. But even if that happened, they could face new competition if people felt they weren't being served by Monsanto and thus would lose customers instantly. 
The market is the best protection you have, far better than regulation, because if the customers aren't happy they walk away instantly. Market competition is the greatest force for good yet invented in the economic world. We've had governments for millennia--but it was the invention of free markets that created the modern prosperity.

If people demand roads, defense, etc., they will also pay for them voluntarily. You don't need to be taxed ever if it's true that people genuinely want these things.
A tax only lets government pay for things no one wants, like war, nationalized healthcare, etc.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Currency is not wealth, it's just the medium in which wealth is translated and exchanged. You can continually add wealth to a fixed currency system and the result is deflation.
To save, even with a fixed currency, all you need to do is to produce more than you consume. A fixed-supply currency doesn't prevent that at all.

Well, gold and silver come to mind. They regulated that out of existence to put the dollar in place in the first place.
The internet is one they're currently strangling, just look at the news, NSA spying and all that. That happened by degree.
Even tech like computers, steam engines, etc., etc., trains. All regulated and overcome by the statists.
But distributed tech like the internet, like torrents, can route around centralized controls. They have no effective long-term weapon against this. 


The US has the reserve currency. That's the difference.
If the dollar falls, others may benefit. China, for instance, or the Euro.
Besides, what's in the interest of states is not in the interest of people using the money, and there's a lot more people than states.
That's ultimately why bitcoin wins.

The mega wealthy have hard commodity and land assets. The money type doesn't matter so much. Many of them are also chafing at government tax and money-laundering crackdown activity. 
True the bankers would be SOL in the sense of losing their positions, but they are allied with politicians and policy-makers and feel they'll be secure there in any case, as long as taxes can be compulsed to be paid in national currency.
They don't see that larger systemic revolution is possible, they think democracy is the end point of history, they don't know what libertarianism is about to birth, a new political order that will sweep the world and make democracy look like tyranny by comparison. 
A truly free society.
You might ask, couldn't the kings of the world, with all their wealth and power and armies, have destroyed the idea of democracy back in the day?
They had all the power and everything to lose. But they failed as well.
Bitcoin, as an idea, is a product of freedom philosophy, one aspect of it, and freedom philosophy will change everything.

The problem is the US gov claims the right to invade your bank account without moment's notice, to freeze all your assets whenever they decide you owe them money.
Why risk it?
Any bank in a US jurisdiction is going to be subject to such claims.

So then why does that employee in your scenario continue to work there? Your  scenario requires that the employee is not a rational economic actor. He/she could just as easily walk away and sell the swords they make. Answer that.


That is an unethical prevention I agree, and has nothing to do with capitalism (since capitalism is not a legal structure) and everything to do with out of control government.

??? The reserve can only do one thing, 'cause inflation when dumped.
I wasn't saying that deflation is not desirable--quite the opposite. I was saying them holding a "reserve" against deflation is not desirable.
Inflation is never desirable. Deflation is never something to "safeguard" against.

Not entirely I'm sure. There's still people able to VPN or TOR around China's firewall. And eventually, when we get meshnet going, or perhaps Namecoin, which was the last thing Satoshi Nakamotow as talking about before he went dark, China won't be able to run their firewall anymore because the DNS servers themselves will be decentralized.
No central DNS, no ability to filter results or taking sites off-line by government fiat.

No, the majority of miners cannot force its will on the minority. If miners wanted they could create a fork at will and run that. If it were collectively controlled that would not be possible.
