This is the kind of video that could make someone a lot of money once this site is an established alternative to YouTube!

She's not LOL funny, but sharp enough "takes" on things to make her pretty good. I tend to think that if anyone has a following this huge, they're obviously hitting the sweet spot for those kids. And yeah, the Bitcoin reference while buried in a quick joke, is evidence of how the word is spreading. She'll be cashing in on the Bitcoin driven YouTube-like websites, very soon. I read where WatchMyBit just received some VC funding and are making deals with record labels and talent around the world. This is the beginning of the monetization of the Internet we've been waiting for.

In Hollywood where I work, WatchMyBit has become the talk of the town. Music labels are discussing the future of the industry based on this "Fan Support Artists for Pennies", site. The tectonic shift of micro-payments is without question being led by WatchMyBit, whose "soft launch" has opened up so much discussion that the site and its features are being "Plussed" to enhance the experience. VC's are lining up for the opportunity to invest in this company. Pretty exciting for everyone with a video on YouTube who makes chump change for millions of views. If your an artists with even a relatively small fan base, go to their site and look at the difference even a small micro-payment can make. WatchMyBit.com

Ha! Very perceptive, targetpro! We wrote and directed the project but cast Johnny Sneed and Chris Moynihan to play us. Plus we were incredibly lucky to get Jane Lynch, Danny Trejo and Jim Rash (Academy Award Winner!)

Oh, shoot, I was just about to send you $450,000. But, now...?

Couldn't disagree more. Multiple focus groups with no knowledge of Bitcoin found the length perfect for the education AND the entertainment factor. Signed, Incredibly Biased Video Creator.
