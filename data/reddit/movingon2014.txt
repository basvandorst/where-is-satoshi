You don't need a fortune to leave forever.   
You'll find a fortune in knowledge, experience and opportunities if you just leave regardless.

A hot wallet sounds like it would work best, but I guess it's the security issue that concerns me.   I'll look into the Blockchain app.
Currently I have some stored in a paper wallet also.   I haven't decided to move them into this "traveling" wallet yet, or to leave them there and just use my others for the "traveling" wallet.
I'm going traveling for a bit, NZ, Asia and....well...haven't planned further than that and don't really intend too...no rush to get anywhere.  A goal to settling in the northern hemisphere though.
Thanks for the help! :)
I planned to put some Bitcoin stickers on my luggage but I've heard you can get harassed going through customs/airports?  Is there any truth to this?   I'd rather not draw the attention!

Hah!  I was trying to figure out how to make vanity QR codes today at work....I should have just logged into Reddit....although I doubt much work would have gotten done after that.... :-/

I second Mycellium, I was suggested it this week and it seems to do everything I want and run pretty smoothly.

I don't have loads of coins, but I would like to carry them on me so if I can use them they are available.
I was thinking of just taking my phone, but since I'll be selling my laptop I am now considering getting the 2013 Nexus 7 as the phone is quite old and small. 
How would I transfer the coins from the lost/stolen phone?  Would it be something like logging in to the wallet online on a different computer and sending them to a new one?

Thanks for the warning, seems a shame as it would be the perfect currency for travelers!

I have a few paper wallets with BIP38 encyption on.  I'll be taking some with me, but was just curious about having some kind of secure wallet to use when I wanted.  
Cheers for the heads up on the stickers.  Shame really as it seems like it could be the perfect currency for travelers.
