Thank you. I also found this thread:
tl/dr: You are right.

Trezor tweets:
PSA: TREZOR is NOT affected by the recently discovered flaw in Infineon libraries (RSA). TREZOR does not use either.

Bot + manual edition. There is a lot of work in that video.

That is only half of the article. The second page is missing.

There is always to be some. Is not like miners are a monolithic corporation or something like that. With just a few hash power the thing will exist and will be a pain in the ass for the legacy camp.

I bought a pair of items (of around 30€) and 3 weeks later received a call from the police. The card used was stolen and Amazon reported the data they had: the delivery address (my house) and my name. I am now a witness for an ongoing investigation. Definitely not fun.
This happened about a month ago. I have withdrawn all my funds from the site and will never use it again. a small disccount is nt worth it..

1) I never assumed so. Read:


2) "economic actors" are real, even if not perfectly defined.
3) A split chain can exist without big miners. Just by existing is going to be dangerous for the miners side.

No. Blochain.info holds the private key for your coins.

Apple needed the iPhone to dethrone Nokia. I do not see any Bitcoin killer around.
Anyway I agree that Bitcoin needs to move forward. My point is that there is no urgency. We can keep calm and be rational. Claims about marketshare are FUD.

Not an expert, but think it is safe if your computer is clean. Not as safe as a hardware wallet though. By online wallets I mean services like blockchain.info that keep your private keys.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:39:00
keepkey is a hardware wallet. After the split your coins will be in both chains. Be careful when spending them though. Inform yourself.

That advantage is not sustainable. Bitcoin WILL implement SegWit + LN. Even a year delay wouldn't be enough to put litecoin ahead of Bitcoin in terms of mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:01:43
That is the thing. You understimate the power of a brand known worldwide. I am talking about orders of magnitude. 200,000 people is a family meeting when you compare it to tens of millions. 
And SegWit WILL activate sooner or later. Well, maybe with a 99% probability. It makes strategic sense for everyone.

A price drop hurts much more the miners than the hodlers

Sovereign nations don't "look upon"; governments do.

Of course miners invest in equipment.  Block's rewards and fees are their bread and butter. Moreover, margins are very tight, otherwise there would be more miners across the world. Drops in price affect them a lot. And that is why your theory is bullshit.
And besides, checking your comment story is quite telling: you want FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:34:03
Does it have limits? daily, monthly?
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:38:36
It is the Tetris theme :D

Well... don't do it all at once.

I opened a ticket with kraken. They don't want to say a word. This is what I got after insisting:




















I suppose they are negotiating with other exchanges and calculating the odds. But they know that they will have to take a side. Even if this side is neutral, it is good for UASF.

You could easily buy bitcoin for cash in localbitcoins.com. Wouldn't that be non-tracable?

I would title this "How the young Internet had its own scaling/political problems and what we can learn from it"
Some ideas:
* The IETF is to Internet as Core is to Bitcoin.
* Internet also had various attempt to claim control over its destiny. Do not let it happen to Bitcoin.
* The development of the underlying system is mainly an engineering problem (Internet / Bitcoin)
* Rough consensus is a proven governance model for a non-profit decentralized engineering driven organization.
* How rough consensus works


*(The Tao of IETF: A Novice’s Guide to the Internet Engineering Task Force, 2012)*
Must read!

I used Purse.io and received a call from the police because my item was bought with a stolen card.
Keep your discount, thank you!

I have seen a lot of answers to you asking this same question (again and again) 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:27:31
Yes
