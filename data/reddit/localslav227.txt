Never said it's long term I said I'm right you all said correction (which it wasn't it was a bubble pop). You all got salty and downvoted me and said I'ma dumbass and I'm wrong. Even though I was right and am still going to stay right easily for the rest of 2018. Just for clarity I do have some money in BTC around 50 dollars I mined. I'm not going to invest any more at least not in btc.

Says who?

While it is less profitable their is nothing stopping someone who wants too...

Although the article is from a month ago the parliament I think is starting to talk about it now 
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:02:28
It's been a month.. it hit a low of 9k and is going down again. It can barley sustain 12k rn. Quit being naive

Mining is still profitable with BTC with nice hash with a single gtx 1080 I make around 6 USD a day. I got the card before the etherrum miners went apeshit and bought every god damn gpu. So I got it for around 650 USD. That is a ROI in 106 days. (Power is miniscule where I'm at .1 a kilowatt

I wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 20 ft dildo right now it seems to be rising but the EU is about to release regulations on it. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:25:24
Make sure you have a spare PC to use in the down time  you'll get bored quick. Make sure to overclock and make sure your gpu stays cool are also important
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:01:34
I'm still right my prediction is right to this day... A month later.. the bubble burst and it will never sustain over 20k again
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:03
It dropped 25% and it dropped 15% today ffs THATS MORE THAN A CORRECTION, and it's gonna keep on dropping
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:50:09
That's 10 million dollars if it's 500 and I'm only doing the giveaway if In fact he mined blocks of 50 in 2010 (Which probably won't be the case). I won't be giving away anywhere near 10 million even if this does happen and let's say I do get the 500 btc. Most likely max 1000 dollar giveaway if it does turn out to be the jackpot (500btc). Note: ( This is unlikely, and there may be no bitcoins at all the stick may of gotten corrupt, and there's a huge chance when he said 10 Bitcoin he meant 10 BTC not 10 blocks. ) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:42:20
Ordered it from Amazon (adapter) will post update in the next week or so ( If it works I'll make a separate post for it). Btw thank you all for the help you've saved me many sleepless nights. Btw if it turns out like some people said he mined in blocks and if it turns out to be 500 BTC I may do a giveaway. (If my dad let's me it is his after all). 
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:09:22
Honestly yes I am.. Happy?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:32:07
He said he mined from 2010 to 2011 mostly in 2010 I think,. but Maybe???
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:02:30
I'd be 1k total due to the fact I'd have to create throw away wallets for each one to give the person. (Don't wanna get hacked) Probs gonna be IF it happens 100$ per person for the first 10 people to claim the wallet or whatever. (I do not wanna create 500 throw away accounts and it's my dad's money he mined it and probs will only agree to something relatively small such as 1k to giveaway if there is one. (NOTE THIS IS NOT A PROMISE OR A PLEDGE I NEVER SAID 100% ANYTHING. this requires A LOT A LOT of things to go right or even better than expected (such as finding out my dad mined 10 blocks instead of 10 btc). REPEAT PLEASE DO NOT GET YOUR HOPES UP. I just want to be clear. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:20
The fact it's gone up over 400% in 4 months it went from 4000 to 19000 in 4 fuckin months. Every time something goes up unchecked it always comes crashing down. Especially since 98% of the people who hold Bitcoin only use it for investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:41:33
That could be true my dad ran his PC for months in 2010 mining. Hope it's true though

update: it turned out to be..... *DRUM ROLL* Fuckin BABY PICTURES. I am sort of laugh-crying right now because that could of been 200k and the pictures look like they are a screen shot of motherfuckin Minecraft (90's camera). Anyway I didn't make any big purchases as I always knew this could happen, so I'm fine. Thank you all for coming along on this crazy journey. Sincerely - Your Friendly neighborhood slav (Btw sorry if my sentence sctructure is weird English isn't my native language and I'm using autocorrect)
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:25:22
Because it is so much money and the Reddit community has helped me so much I thought I'd be generous. It's also 1/10000 of the money if this hyptothetical situation happens (refer to my last comment for clauses for this to happen)

Possibly but I believe it will take some time as the bubble just popped
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:37:04
It wasn't the key lmao it was to mark it for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:42:03
My dad's old but he's not that old to have a password as BC
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:33:02
The bitcoins are on a hard drive not connected to the internet(backed up already). He mined them using easy mine and can't find the file. Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:45:24
Btw dad said BC either stood for Bitcoin or baby pictures. I'ma cry if it's baby pictures, yeah there cool but there not worth 200k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:06
Note looking at graph again of Bitcoin price it looks ereilley similar to the stock market in 2007 before the crash. Get perpared for a depression sell now Bois.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:38:24
It dropped 15% in a single day and doesn't seem to be stopping Bitcoin is overbought and when people see the price drop all the people who took a second mortgage out on their house or invested a lot will sell hoping not to go homeless. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:51:04
Guess WHO WAS RIGHT!! IT hasn't recovered
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:56:24
I didn't dump at 6k who the fuck holds Bitcoin when it's the dinosaur of crypto? I already told you I've had nothing in BTC for the past couple months. Why? It's dino tech and is a shitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:23:19
Update: Bitcoin is dead and won't be commin back R.I.P Bitcoin and it's dino tech
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:00:08
Did you lose your ass? Be honest when did you buy?? I bought at 3k and sold at 19k. Now you
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:57:51
Do you know anything about investing? Because apparently you still have BTC?? Did you not sell off at 20k like a smart person would or have you lost your ass??
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:50:51
Dogecoin is a memecoin and is still better then shitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:01:42
I was mocking not you but the general idea that BTC will go rip-roaring again. BTC won't ever be more than an investment. It's not anonymous it's not quick it's not free to send BTC. The fucks the point.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:43:11
Ffs you are taking the bait read to the end. After the first sentence it's serious
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:48:03
I'm looking through older posts and hindsight is 20/20 but I fucking called it. It's 7k now GG lost over 60% of value and won't come back lol. Thank God I cashed out at 19k
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:49:48
Dumb dumb I sold at 19k the highest it will ever reach!
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:42:24
Read past the first sentence the rest is serious
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:50:18
You really think I'm one of the retards that still has BTC?? I dumped that shit quick when it eclipsed
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:54:57
I love how people still think BTC will get "big" but no one wants to hear it because "MUH MOON LAMBOS!! ITS A CORRECTION NOT A CRASH!! IT'LL COME BACK!!!!" You fucks sound like the type of people who would buy stocks in 1929 the day before the crash because "MUH BTC(STOCKS) CAN NEVER CRASH!". You guys probably bought at 10k-18k and are mad you lost your ass.
