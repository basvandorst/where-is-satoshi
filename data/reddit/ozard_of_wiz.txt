Ah good, I was wondering when censorship would make it to r/bitcoin too. 
So nobody's allowed to warn of volatility or predictions without hearing "lol, nice try bank of america"? I like my subreddits honest, this isnt PCMR, I think we should be allowed to share our opinions.
Believe me, I wouldnt be so cynical if Bitcoin jumped above 500pts so this honesty (if we're following this post) is actually hurting the value of my coin. 
This feels like losing on the world's longest lasting scratch off lotto ticket/roulette wheel. I want my instant gratification forex trading, cant handle this "wait 40 years to sell, or 10 seconds to buy" double-standard.
Anyone telling you that stealing a cop car is illegal just wants to keep all the free cop cars to themselves, trust me its legal, do it.

Hey, any details on this, like WHICH retailers will work with bitcoin for this event?
The lack of info makes me think its supposed to be a surprise for the faithful who signed up for the email or something.

Ah shoot! This is the problem though, its another trust exercise in which I buy bitcoin to use only in shops around NYC, Chicago, LA, Denmark, and Seattle none of which i feel like traveling to for use of my bitcoin when they likely will accept cash all the same.
ARRGH! Please someone help me like bitcoin! I really really want to like it. Like an abusive boyfriend telling me how much better things'll be next year or next week, borrowing money for something big. 
Any hints on stores I can find in my area? I get the feeling ill be buying bitcoin for no practical (or purchasing) reason.

My bitcoin is locked in bitcoin until friday, it feels like the longest spin of roulette. My hope is a bounce back. If it shorts any further on friday, Im out for however much I can salvage. I remember thinking 367 was low....nope.
Maybe I'll let it coast till saturday if it boomerangs enough.
