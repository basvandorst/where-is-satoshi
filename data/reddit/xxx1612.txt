I think instead of a banning . The has Feds has been building or toying the idea of bitcoin which is the answer to our trillion dollar debt to china there is no way out but bitcoin and crypto to slice down our debt. Either by inflation or bitcoin . That is why china si bigtime on banning cryptos. With crypto and bitcoin inflationary result will buckle down an economic downturn.

so you thinks its better to buy an antminer?
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:33:57
Actually I was calculating at 26 trillion but to China at 1.7trillion or maybe half of 26 t is very doable at less than 1 million per bitcoin. A balance of inflation and bitcoin valuations . Fiat will still be at play here.
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:23:09
Probably 5 to 10 years or sooner cause the Trillion debt has been shutting down our Feds they will have to do something before an economic collapse.

They restarted after the website upgrade I believe but I didnt know those features till recently this month. It cost me loss of sleep... I have to play with the tabs a little bitj make sure the equal sign is press when entering ur limit price or it will ask for percentage instead of actual price of sell.
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:55:03
US fed owes 26 trillions in foreign and non foriegn creditors.  At 22 million per bitcon is still not enough to pay off debt.  It would take. 1181818 bitcoins at 22 million each coin to payoff that debt lol. I guess inflation is just around the corner. Hoarding cryptos will be my regular hobby now lol
