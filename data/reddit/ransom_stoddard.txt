Or, mining moves off shore and away from compromised nations with insane over-regulation and over-taxation, and the block chains forks to compensate for any regulation-based changes forced upon compromised Bitcoin Core Developers and miners. There are ~7.13 billion people in the world. America has ~350 million people...
Oh, but hasn't part of that already happened with the Chinese being the largest miners and Bitcoin folk giving up their American citizenship and/or moving their families, businesses and tax revenue to more accommodating nations? 
American legislatures are already fighting between a hands-off approach and over-regulation that is retarding innovation and participation.
Going 'Full Retard' over-regulating and over-taxing will only lose them *more* revenue and control than they so greedily seek with insane over-taxation, over-regulation and legislation attempting to control Bitcoin. It's in the tea leaves right now and has been for a while. Nations that want to be a part of this growing Bitcoin economy should tread lightly and act accordingly or they may price themselves right out of the Bitcoin economy.

Buy them, mine them, and accept them for their products and services, like auto parts sales and auto mechanic repair work and space, and tool/space rental for people to perform their own auto repair work using the new parts they just purchased.
Imagine a large auto salvage yard where you can sell an old used junk car, buy used auto parts, rent needed tools and lets you repair your automobile on site, all using Bitcoins. Perhaps they even have experienced auto repair mechanics to do it for you or help you.

You OKCoin people sound like a bunch of deadbeats who break contracts and don't pay your bills. OKCoin obviously can't be trusted, unless they can come up with an unforged and digitally-signed contract, which they can't, because it does not exist. Pay your fucking bills, you OKCoin crooks.

He/she is not-so-slyly attempting to justify violating the privacy of Bitcoin users and the pseudo-anonymity of Bitcoin itself by using fear tactics, instead of advocating for education on security and data backups and redundancy.
Just create routine backups of all important data and secure your computers and devices. Then if they're hit, simply reformat and transfer the data backups.
Also, use real time anti-virus and anti-malware protection.
I routinely use Clonezilla to create backup clones of my hard drives, so if I am ever hit, I can switch hard drives and move on with my life like nothing happened. I also have alternate backups of all important data on USB sticks.

I recommend using [KeePass]( I use random generated complex and long passwords on all sites now, all of them different passwords, so if one is ever compromised, I just have to change them on one site. You can export and encrypt the database file as you do your crypto wallets. It has a tree structure like computer folders so you can organize by category. I use it for everything.  Yes, it makes things slower, but a lot safer.

That is not true. Mr. Ver has paid every tax he has owed, and I am confident that he will pay every tax he legally owes in the future. He simply moved to a nation with more sane tax laws and gave up his American citizenship so he could no longer be taxed as an American living abroad. If you have evidence suggesting otherwise, please present it here.

Yea, I noticed that, much like I noticed how you seeded funding on *your own* [Craft Beer from Tyrol Austria campaign]( before you learned that Indiegogo publically lists such activity [on your profile page]( so you most likely decided to sign up and open alternate indiegogo accounts to mask you seeding your own campaigns.

What if they do not include mining functionality in their wallet software, and went closed source?
How are you going to mine on their network?
If their core mining software is closed source, not distributed, protected by compression of the executables, and/or have a closed network only certain hostnames/IP's can connect to, I don't see how you will mine on their network.

I believe; it is best not to document your Bitcoins at all, and keep them away from any Last Will and Testament, thus away from any possibility of probate or interpretation by Courts,  thus protected against unwanted redistribution against your wishes.
I believe; there are secure and secret ways to transfer the private keys and educate your heirs on Bitcoin and remnainin pseudo-anonymous *before you die*, much like handing your kids an envelope containing cash and teaching them asset managment.
You might have 5 children. You might give those 5 children heirloom-quality items with one-fifth of the private key stamped or embedded on or within it, prefixed or suffixed with an ordering letter or number. 
You might contact 5 different attorneys in 5 different jurisdictions, so they never cross paths concerning you, each holding a sealed correspondence only to be delivered to each of the children upon your confirmed death or irreversible severe disability or illness, only to be confirmed by an obituary or classified advertisement in a specific periodical or newspaper.
You might enlist a sixth attorney who has been instructed to place that obituary or classified advertisement in that specific periodical or newspaper, only after confirming your illness, disability or death.
You might have a durable necklace with a stamped id-tag, stating that the sixth attorney should be contacted upon your death or severe disability...
I believe; there are endless scenarios where an intelligent person can secretly and securely pass on liquid assets and easily convertible wealth from one generation to another.
**DISCLAIMER:** This has only been a thought experiment, and I am not advocating anyone break any laws.

If you believe *that* is complicated, you should see the ways the elites of the world obfuscate their own wealth so it is free from seizure and redistribution. What I typed about is kiddy stuff in comparison.
Your bank account can be seized. Your bank account can be forced through probate. Your bank account can be frozen, pending any litigation by any person or legal entity after you die if they feel they should have gotten some of your assets, or maybe they feel as though they did not get enough.
*Right now*, there is a ranch in the USA that is being sold. It was bequeathed to his children when the owner died, and his wish was to have his kids run the ranch. Some of the kids wanted to run the ranch, but not all of them, so a judge ordered it be sold, then the money split between the kids. The dead owners last wish was shot to hell. The kids wish to honor their parents last request, shot to hell. Land can be seized.
There is a daughter of a man who successfully sued her fathers estate when he left her one dollar in his will to teach her a lesson. His last wish shot to hell and she got millions for it.
Last Wills and Testaments are *routinely* overturned and set aside to redistribute that wealth.
It's the future, because you control your assets. You don't control your bank account. You only *think* you control it. Believing otherwise is pure folly. Just ask the countless millions of people in Cyprus, Greece and all those other countries going bankrupt how they control their bank accounts...
Before Bitcoin, all you could control was the physical goods and wealth that you could hold in your hands and effectively keep secret and hidden from anyone else. 
All that said, it certainly does not have to be that complex. You can teach your kids about security and Bitcoin and just give them to your kids before you die, or have a trusted relative or friend do it.

How exactly do you hook up gold diggers with wealthy people?
I am a wealthy person. I would want nothing to do with a gold digger.
Are the 10,277 members on that site a lie too?
If not, how do you have no money with so many members who must pay you to communicate with each other?
By all looks, that site is a success, unless it's all a lie and manipulated numbers in the source code and database, so which is it, son?
Also, your site says it pays commissions. How do you pay commissions with no money?
I read what you're saying, but none of it is making any sense to me.

Then you are still telling 98% of the world that you do not want their business. I dont believe in niche markets in the long term, unless you have the money and power to create legislative and/or regulatory/bureaucratic barriers to entry for potential competition, in which case you can cause demand to be so high that you can pull them towards using Bitcoin. At this point, I dont see that happening on a large and profitable scale. It's a bad business model and self-defeating IMO.

Banks will say they erred on the side of caution... something, something... terrorism... something, something... KYC... something, something... AML... something, something... structuring... something, something... drugs... something, something... saving the currency, national security, the economy... and they'll do it again and again and again until it becomes financially unfeasible to attack Bitcoin. The banks are going to get massive bureaucratic and legislative support during this investigation (inquiry really?) too. This is where the fight really begins IMO. What strategy do the big banks have in mind here? They are quite literally geniuses.
Plus side is that this should advertise Bitcoin to new potential users.
