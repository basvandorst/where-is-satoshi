I just thought sharing this might help to inspire other people to do little things that could help benefit the entire community. The more people talk about bitcoin, the more that gets bought, the more the value goes up.

Yeah, but he still mentioned all the weird foreign currency he had and the things he actually showed on the air were the things that WEREN'T cash. I really don't care that much if anyone gets my 2 dollars in btc, all I was trying to do was to get John to briefly mention it on the air.

I meant "fake" in the sense that it wasn't established to actually be a church and worship some kind of deity, it was established purely to show people how easy and unrestricted it is for religious based groups to take money from vulnerable people. 
Say that my little brother complained to me and said "you always burn the cookies when you make them". And to prove a point about how little I actually overcook the cookies, I take one cookie and leave it in the oven until it's burnt and black all the way through. I then show this cookie to my brother, and say, "see this? this is a burnt cookie. Those cookies with a little bit of dark brown around the edges are not burnt".
Yeah, the black cookie is still technically a real cookie, but it wasn't made with the intention of anyone really eating it. The effort that went into it wasn't real and genuine, it was essentially created as a prop or a conversation piece. So it doesn't make sense to refer to it as a genuine cookie, because it was never intended to be treated as one. 
That is possibly the worst analogy I'm ever attempted to make, but I'm too tired to go back and try to type something else up to explain why I felt "Our Lady...." was more accurately described as a fake-church. Okay, I need to stop typing and sleep.
