Probably down

I used to use that but I found cryptoport handles multiple extanges and alt coins much better

Bitcoins lives as in, black lives, or as in Flynn lives?

My 76 year old grandmother who barely speaks English ask me if I knew about Bitcoin, it's definitely getting mainstream attention

Thanks for the suggestion I'll probably make a video soon
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:05:41
I think you have a point, i just thought it would be a bit easier but I guess not
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:39:25
I don't think I have the time for local bitcoins, never used it but I'd imagine it takes a bit of planning, and I don't speak the language, it could go horribly wrong

Just signed up and everything, it's not available in the US but "will be soon" I don't think it will be soon enough

Tungsten carbide but only because it's more scratch resistant, but it's way Overkill even, say aluminum imo is Overkill because it's in a what looks like glass and metal housing
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:47:41
I'll look into it thanks
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:46:43
It's basically the hardest thing next to diamond, but also fairly  brittle, it doesn't really oxidise, or change (I only have experience using tungsten endmills and drill bits don't know about engraving but it seems like OP bought some sort of engraver, and tungsten blanks are fairly cheap)
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:00:42
True, maybe 304 stainless steel, but if you can use CNC you could engrave much deeper then with just a engraver, or you could stamp it fairly easy with letter punches,which would be cheaper but it may not look as good, also tungsten can't be stamped, the only way to mark it is threw sand blasting with a mask, or electolosis and even then it's very​ fait and not very deep
