You're already paying nearly that for coffee when you use a credit card – it's just built in to the vendor's price.
$5 x 3% = 15¢

Thanks for the post, but don't cash out into fiat! Buy physical gold and silver.

It is, and it is.

We have a Friendly Toast in Portsmouth too. I'll be sure to mention BTC next time I'm there.

You clearly don't know much about firearms. 
1. That holster is snap-closed – no one is grabbing it from him. 
2. Many, many more people are concealed carrying everyday. Is that terrifying? Or is it just because the OP is being honest enough to show you he is armed?
3. You didn't address the fact that police open carry in every town across America (and much of the world). Statistically, innocents are MUCH more likely to be hurt by one of them than by a private citizen.

I think that would be fine. I can't imagine Satoshi was wedded to Bitcoin in particular, but rather the idea that crypto could outcompete fiat.

Yes, and that's why understanding the underlying concepts and precise definitions is important. If the money supply increases, prices *will* rise a corresponding amount over time. In fact, in aggregate, that's the only reason the "price level" rises. Otherwise, due to productivity gains, prices tend to fall over time.
This is a good intro to these concepts:

Inflation is growth of the money supply: 
That growth is fixed for bitcoin.
You're asking about purchasing power.

I see what you mean. No one is better at spreading knowledge than escorts.
