The only people who can accelerate a transaction are large miners. 
Google "replace by fee"
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:50:51
Transaction speed all depends on the fee relative to the transaction size(in bytes). High fees confirm in ~10min. Very low fees might never confirm. The meaning of high and low change depending on how busy the network is. 
SegWit transactions take up less space in the block, so they are either cheaper or faster. For a given fee they will be faster or for a given speed it will be cheaper.

I was just pointing out that you made all these conservative assumptions, and then one very aggressive assumption. I'm sorry my answer is kind of a cop out but... The ideal number of users is however many the network can support,  but the network should always strive to improve so that one day maybe it can be the whole world.
Nobody has really solved scaling at this point. I personally see layers and sidechains as a better solution, but I'm excited to see how it works out over the next couple decades. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:35:54
Miners have different costs. In a gradual decline, the miners with the highest costs will at some point stop mining and difficulty will adjust down improving roi.
In a doomsday scenario where roi(price) drops to near 0 quickly and there is no reason to believe it will recover(perhaps due to the discovery of a major security flaw) , everyone stops mining and Bitcoin dies.

A couple criticisms... 


We've already had one(segwit). On top of that, most bitcoin developers  is not necessarily opposed to an increase long term. They just want to optimize other things first. 
Continued optimizations will also allow for more transactions in the available space (segwit adoption, schnorr etc.)


That's crazy. Something like 40% of the world doesn't even have a bank account. Bitcoin isn't going to replace government currency any time soon.

Of course there is. You just have to do the math for your situation. All the numbers are known except for difficulty. So take a guess at the difficulty when you start mining and how the difficulty will change from there, and then plug all your numbers into any of the many online mining calculators.

This is a silly statement. Of course something can be worth less than the cost to produce it. If that happened miners would just stop mining. Luckily not all miners have equal costs. The miners with the highest cost would drop out first and difficulty would adjust down reducing the mining costs for everyone.

If you cut a loaf of bread in half it doesn't make any more bread. The same is true if you cut it in half again and again. The same is true of money. 
When a government prints more money it devalues all the existing money. Because all the holders of that currency now have a lower portion  of the total money supply. 
If Bitcoin were split into more pieces, the holders would not have their share devalued.

There are several new technologies which (hopefully) will reduce fees in the near future. In the meantime, don't use coinbase.

The same number of transactions are still being processed due to the mempool (backlog of unprocessed transactions).
If transactions are being generated faster than processed, the mempool and fees grow. 
If processing is faster than creation, the mempool and fees shrink.
If the second state exists long enough, the mempool is emptied and then the rate of processing falls simply because there aren't enough transactions to fill the blocks.

Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks. But node operators can set their own rules for dropping transactions and if someone rebroadcasts the transaction, the clock resets. Also, even after a transaction is "dropped" it will technically be a valid transaction forever and could be processed at any time in the future.
Bitcoin isn't a company. With Bitcoin, you are your own bank. There is nowhere to "open a support ticket". There is also no way to cancel a transaction. This means that you are truly in charge of your money, but it also means that there are no safety nets. Please do a bit more research to really understand it so you don't make a mistake that costs you money. 
With this particular transaction, you can wait the 2weeks and hope it drops. Or if you need to get it moving, google "replace by fee" or "Bitcoin transaction accelerator".

This is a wallet issue, not a bitcoin issue.There is no minimum fee in bitcoin. Many wallets specify the fee in sat/b hence your options on the low end are 0 or 1. 
However, if your wallet (electrum for example) lets you manually set a fee, you could set for example "10 satoshis" which on a 226 byte transaction would give you 10/226 = 0.044 sat/B.

You have it exactly backwards. Market order way more uncertainty. 
With a market order, the price you are shown before you submit the order is an estimate based on when you typed the order. The order is filled at a different price just after you hit submit. If a whale happens to place a big order, just in front of you, the market can move a lot in that time.
A market buy is "buy xx btc at the lowest available price" 
A limit buy is "buy xx btc for at the lowest available price as long as that price is not higher than Y"
A limit order is jut that, a limit. You will still pay the lowest available price, but you won't get screwed if the market swings wildly

Exchanges losing user funds has been a semi-regular part of crypto history (most famously Mt. Gox). Processing delays, service outages, and lack of customer service are still the norm. I agree that it is very unlikely that you will lose your money keeping it in coinbase, but may users have valid concerns and are uncomfortable leaving money in exchanges.

Difficulty changes with hashpower. Miners come and go all the time. If miners are joining the network more than leaving, difficulty goes up. If they are leaving more than joining, difficulty goes down. The goal of difficulty changes is to balance the hashpower changes make it so that the total available hashpower can find one block every 10min.
Various things can effect the miner inflow/outflow (bitcoin price, electricity price, hardware costs, competing coins, etc.)

Multisig wallet if you really want to do this. But make sure you think through the implications. The only upside that I see is that it would save you a small amount of transaction fees. However, I see lots of downside, if you need the money want to sell at some point and he doesn't, you are out of luck. If he dies/looses his key/etc. you are out of luck. Thats a lot of trust.

This is not necessarily wrong, but it is based on a flawed understanding of how the system works. 
A handful of cheap household computers are more than capable of supporting the network. The network is designed such that one block is found every 10 minutes. Adding more miners would result in faster blocks if the network was unable to compensate. Hence, there is something called "difficulty". As miners are added, the difficulty increases to maintain the 10 min block time. If miners start to leave, the difficulty will go back down. 
It takes a lot of computing power because the difficulty is high. The difficulty is high because there is a lot of computing power. It is a self balancing system.

Importing won't do anything on its own. What you need to do depends on where you want those coins to end up.
If you want them to be in the software wallet, then sweep. 
If just want them consolidated and back on a paper wallet, then import into the software wallet and immediately send them to a new paper wallet. 
Either of these options will consolidate your inputs, each will involve one block-chain transaction. What you should not do is sweep and then send to a paper wallet (two transactions).

Rebroadcast = push it to the network again. If you ever wanted to, you could do it yourself here: 
And to your second question... Yes send a new translation involving the same coins, even if you just send them to yourself. Once this new transaction is processed, the first transaction is no longer valid because it would be a double spend. 
The other option if you were sending coins to yourself in the first place is to just keep control of the receiving address in case it ever goes through. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:26:52
You don't want to "sweep". You want to "import". 
Sweeping creates a blockchain transaction moving the coins to a new address and costing you a fee. Importing just gives a software wallet access to the private key so it can spend from the existing paper wallet. 
If you google sweep vs. import you will find more info. I use Electrum for this, but many wallets can do it.

While you hold an asset, you have "paper losses" and "paper gains". When you sell, those losses and gains are realized. Your buy-in is a sunk cost and shouldn't affect your decision to hold or sell. 
If you believe your asset will be worth more in the future you hold. If you believe it will be worth less you sell.

I can't deny that bitcoin has a scaling problem, but BCH is not the solution. It is the worst of numerous altcoins attempting on chain scaling. Moving your daily transactions to another coin is reasonable at this point, but beware of BCH. It is incredibly centralized and short sighted. It just has a good salesman and support from a few insiders with deep pockets. If you want a big name look at LTC, ETH, or XRP. There are also numerous smaller coins that would work as well.

The first confirmation happens when your transaction is included in a block. Each additional confirmation comes whenever an additional block is added to the blockchain after that first one. They happen on average every 10min. 
Paying a higher fee can make the first confirmation happen faster, but there is nothing you can do to speed up additional confirmations. 
If you want to see when the confirmations occurred, look up the timestamp for the block that included your transaction and then every subsequent block.

You are right. They will be visible as spendable again in his wallet after they drop from the core mempool. So he will "have the coins back" in loose terms. 
OP, to be 100% sure the transaction is never processed, move the coins again when you get them back.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:42:03
You paid 50.222 sat/B. 
Transactions at that level haven't confirmed since 12/6. 
If the mempool keeps getting busier, it will never confirm. If traffic lets up significantly, it could happen within a few hours. It is difficult to predict, but based on recent history and upcoming events, my opinion is that this is unlikely to process any time soon.  This is quite a bit of money. If you can replace by fee, I would do that in the 140sat/B range.
Core nodes by default drop transactions after 2weeks. However, there is no set number and once a transaction is broadcast it could technically be processed at any point in the future. See my reply here:

Almost any exchange will let you sell that much It just might take a while to withdrawal fiat. Gemini has a 100k daily withdrawal limit and many other exchanges offer "enhanced verification" to increase your limits. Depending on what you clan get approved for, it might take a few weeks to get your money out, but it isn't that hard.
Also, for that much you should consider an OTC service like iBit. They will match you with a large single buyer and do it all in one transaction.

There is no such thing as an individual bitcoin or an individual satoshi in the way you are implying. What is tracked are called UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs). 
Here is an example (ignoring mining fees for the sake of simplicity): 
If address A has 1btc in 1 UTXO, it can then send 0.5btc to wallet B and 0.5btc to wallet C with each having 1UTXO. Now, if B and C both send their contents back to A, A will now have 2UTXOs of 0.5btc each. To contain the same 1btc. 
By looking at the flow of transactions it is possible to track movements of bitcoin to a large extent, but what are stored are UTXOs.

Bitcoin has a limited capacity and a fee market that inherently drives fees up. Lightning has an unlimited capacity and a fee market that inherently drives fees down. This will almost certainly result in **much** lower fees on the Lightning network. People like lower fees so they will choose to use Lightning.

This is correct. You are trusting coinbase to keep track of your coins. This is why many users say "not your keys, not your coins". In the unlikely event that coinbase goes bankrupt or decides to steal your money, you would be out of luck. Try to keep the bulk of your funds under your own control.


Did you recive 0.00818837-0.00030596 = 0.00788241 BTC in your wallet? If so, you were charged exactly what they promised. One consequence of your first point(them managing coins however works best for them rather than keeping them user specific) is that they have lots of coins in lots of different wallets in random amounts. Withdraw transactions may involve those random ammounts, but you should end up with the right amount of coin. 
That said, use GDAX in the future for lower fees.

IMO there will be another 50+% correction and a bear market, but I can't predict when. This has happened several times and it has always turned around and found a new ATH.

It depends on your fee. A high enough fee will always be about 10min, a low fee might never process. When people say "it's taking forever" what they mean is lots of traffic has driven fees up and fast confirmations are currently expensive, and that they haven't paid a high enough fee to be processed right away. 
Fees have come down a lot in the last 24 hours.

Unfortunately, the network is very backlogged at the moment resulting in huge transaction fees. Evidently, you didn't increase the fee enough to be served right away.

They are saying that the network fee is more than your balance. This is Bullshit. 
The bitcoin network fees have been undeniably high recently. Bitcoin is undergoing some growing pains. There is a long term scaling plan to address this, but there will be periods of high fees in the meantime. The good news is that fees are coming back down at the moment, hopefully that continues. If you were sending this transaction yourself (not through coinbase) it would probably cost &lt;5GBP to get it processed in the next few blocks. Coinbase has the option to batch transactions. This means that coinbase fees should be lower (not higher) than what you could get as an individual.
Coinbase handles transactions very poorly resulting in high fees. On top of that, they quietly mark up the fees they charge you and pocket the difference. Long term, look into using another service.
Short term, transfer the money to GDAX and send it from there. That will be free.

Risk tolerance is pretty specific to you. Bitcoin is still very volatile/speculative. The usual advice here is to "invest what you can afford to lose".
Pick an amount and ask:
1) Could I live with myself if I lost this much on a bad investment?
2) Could I still support myself and my family if I lost this amount?
For a lot of people, this guides them to a conservative 5-10%. But, if you are 25 and single with a stable high paying job and marketable skills but not much in savings, maybe its 100%.

By default on core nodes it was originally 72hours. That was later changed to 2 weeks. These are the most commonly reported numbers. 2 weeks is more accurate at this point. 
However, there is no set number. These numbers assumes nobody rebroadcasts the transaction. If it is rebroadcast, the clock resets. Also, each node maintains its own mempool and node operators are free to set up whatever rules they want for transaction expiration (including never dropping transactions).
It is important to know that once a transaction is broadcast, it technically could be rebroadcast and confirmed at any point in the future. After a transaction is "dropped", the only way to make sure that that transaction is permanently invalid is to move those same input coins to a new address. Doing so means that any future attempt to process the original transaction would be a double spend.

Fees are proportional to the size of the transaction in bytes. The size relates to the complexity of the transaction. This transaction has 5 inputs and totals 1963bytes. The median transaction is 226 bytes. 
This transaction takes as much space on the blockchain as 8+ median sized transactions. 
TL/DR: This is a big transaction. Thus it is expensive.

Of course its possible. The daily traded volume of BTC is something like $15B. Granted, that is across many exchanges and many currency pairs, but individual orders of 100+BTC are not uncommon.

Bitcoin is undergrowing some growing pains. A lot of traffic has driven fee sup recently. At the same time, bitcoin is being attacked by entities who would like to see it fall and be replaced by something they can control. The long term plan for bitcoin is spot on. Give it some time.  It is taking its time to achieve sustainable scaling while remaining decentralized. Other coins have chosen easier but shortsighted solutions. 
Fees are coming back down right now. We are back to 140sat/B. That is still high, but it looks like it will continue dropping. 
Without knowing the size(in bytes) of your transaction, I have no way of knowing if 20 euro is reasonable. However, wallet fee estimators generally aren't great. Choose a sat/B by looking at the current state of the mempool and set a manual fee accordingly.

Don't tell anyone, at least until you are 18(and preferably not even then). While you are still a minor, they could try to take control of your investment.

Fees aren't measured in dollars. They are sat/B. 
Your wallet probably contains lots of small outputs resulting in a big/complex/expensive transaction. 
The network is under a lot of stress right now resulting in higher fees for everyone. Unfortunately, your best bet is to wait and see if network congestion calms down.

First, technology has to evolve and change. Trumpeting the whitepaper or "satoshi's vision" is misguided in my opinion. Something being "in the whitepaper" is not a particularly valid argument. It is better to discuss technical merit. Even if you do want to go down that route, there are records of satoshi discussing a 2nd layer:
There are other coins with viable scaling plans, but my opinion is that scaling 100% on chain is a bad choice. From a common sense point of view, it seems silly to record every tiny transaction forever. From a technical point of view, I believe on chain scaling necessarily leads to centralization. I also believe that the base layer should be as decentralized as possible. I don't fear centralized hubs on a second layer as long as the base blockchain is keeping them honest. 
There are several coins with what I see as viable scaling plans, but Bitcoin obviously has a head start on name recognition. And I believe that lightning is at least as developed as any of the other off chain solutions.
It is a race for sure. If lightning is implemented and adopted in the near future, bitcoin wins. If this high fee/low capacity network carries on for too long, something could certainly overtake it.

You got it basically. 
A sell limit order in plain english is "I would like to sell X bitcoins at a price not lower than Y"
A buy limit order in plain english is "I would like to buy X bitcoins at a price not higher than Y"
There are several types of orders, but inexperienced traders often place "market orders"(don't do this). A market order translates to "buy or sell at whatever the current price is". If someone else places a big order(and moves the market) just before you send your market order, your price can be very different than what you expected.

Short version: 
For you to sell, the money has to come from another person (the buyer).  If everyone wants to sell and nobody wants to buy, the price goes to $0 and none of the sellers can sell unless they want to give it away for free. However, it is unlikely that literally everyone will want to sell at once. Price could go down, but as long as there are some buyers,  some value will remain.
Long Version:
Lets imagine there are 1000 people in a room. 500 on one side of the room have a bitcoin, 500 on the other side do not. One guy steps up and says "Hey, I have this bitcoin here, who wants to buy it?"
Some of the people with no bitcoin want it and they see that there is only one available. Someone offers a reasonable price based on recent sales, lets say $11,000, a sale is made, and the price has gone up.
Now, in your doomsday scenario, all 500 people who have a bitcoin start trying to sell them all at once.. Everyone who doesn't have bitcoin sees all these sellers and think "maybe I can pay less". Someone shouts out  "I'll pay $9000" and a sale is made. Then someone shouts "I'll pay $5000" and another sale is made. Then $2000, then $1000, etc. At some point, all the buyers say, "man these bitcoins keep droping in price. I don't want any. I wouldn't pay anything" At that point, there are no buyers and nowhere for the money to come from so nobody can sell. 
Theoretically this could happen. It has started to happen several times in bitcoin's history when it has lost 50-80% of its value in a very short time. However, there have always been buyers who at some point change their mind again and say "look at these low prices, I should buy some". Then the price starts to rise again. 
Could bitcoin implode and go to $0 and everyone loses all their money... sure. Will it... probably not.

1) Coinbase handles transactions very poorly resulting in high fees. On top of that, they quietly mark up the fees they charge you and pocket the difference. Look into using another service.
 
2) That said, the bitcoin network fees have been undeniably high recently. Bitcoin is undergoing some growing pains. There is a long term scaling plan to address this, but there will be periods of high fees in the meantime. The good news is that fees are coming back down at the moment, hopefully that continues.

They sell to you at a little higher than the current GDAX price. They buy on GDAX and sell to you at a markup. That is how they make money. Coinbase and GDAX are the same company. Coinbase is more user friendly. GDAX is cheaper. 
If you are comfortable with and exchange/trading user interface, you can save money by using GDAX directly. Its not that hard... just make sure you use limit orders and you can't get in too much trouble.

If you are looking at your transaction on blockchain.info, on the right side under "summary" it says "Included in blocks" Then lists a block number and a time.  That is your first confirmation. 
Then look up (that block number)+1 that will give you the time for your second confirmation. Keep adding 1 for however many confirmations you want to look up. 
GDAX usually pays a high enough fee to be included in a block very quickly, so the average time for 3 confirmations will be ~30min. The catch is that that the 30min is after GDAX sends the transaction. They don't always send them right away. I have heard that sometimes they can wait up to a few hours before sending. I don't know what that average is.

Bitcoin is undergrowing some growing pains. It is taking its time to achieve sustainable scaling while remaining decentralized. Other coins have chosen easier but shortsighted solutions. At the same time, bitcoin is being attacked by entities who would like to see it fall and be replaced by something they can control. The long term plan for bitcoin is spot on. Give it some time.
Fees are coming back down right now. We are back to 170sat/B. That is still high, but it looks like it will continue dropping. Hopefully your transaction is handled soon.

Coinbase isn't really an exchange. When you buy on a real exchange, you are (generally) buying from another individual. 
When you buy from coinbase, coinbase has to buy on a real exchange(gdax), then sell to you at a higher price (this is how they make money). Coinbase prices are always high. 
At coinbase you pay a higher price for an easier user experience.

I agree that a hub operator could control payments through their hub. But, I also believe that the network will be large enough to make network wide control impossible. Running a node will be profitable so a lot of people will do it.

Bitcoin is similar to any other asset that doesn't pay dividends. People who buy gold or non dividend stocks are doing so because they hope someone else will pay more later. Are gold or Amazon stock ponzi schemes?
You might say that those things have some underlying inherent value  or assets. That is true. But the price of gold is far beyond the industrial value. The price is high because people think it should be. 
Amazon profits are tiny(often negitive). They do have assets but nowhere near enough to justify the market cap. Most of the value is in the brand, the network, and speculation. 
Bitcoins underlying inherent values(similar to golds conductivity and malleability) are the decentralized, border less ,censorship resistance, nature of the coins. The rest of the value is in the brand, the network and speculation.

Core nodes drop transactions by default after 2 weeks, but if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets. 
Also, each node operator can set their own rules for their own mempool. It is possible to run a node that never drops a transaction. Once a transaction has been signed and broadcast, it is valid forever and could be processed at any time in the future. Though most wallets make the (technically incorrect) assumption that it won't be processed after the two weeks. 
If a transaction is ever "returned" to your wallet, you should move the coins again asap. Doing so is necessary to invalidate the original transaction. Other it could be processed unexpectedly at a future date. 
Look up "transaction accelerator" or "replace by fee" if you want to get it moving.

You did the math right, 140sat/B should process pretty quick right now. You could go lower and roll the dice that fees keep dropping, but that isn't guaranteed to happen.

This video is a little long, but does a great job of explaining it. 
A transaction can't be canceled by any one user, but an entire block can be "orphaned" by the network. Also, each new confirmation does not use any extra energy relating directly to your transaction. It just means more blocks are stacked on top of the block containing your transaction.

Blockchain.info seems to be having trouble right now. 
On a different blockchain explorer: 
That address currently holds 0.0001BTC. Sent to it on May 24 2013 and currently worth ~$1.95.
If this public key is all the information you have, there is no way to access it. If you want to access it directly, you need the private key. Otherwise, you need to know what service you set up the wallet on and if they are still around go through their recovery process. For &lt;$2 I probably wouldn't put the time into trying to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:34:25


This will work, but take note of the link in my first reply. That transaction you already sent will be technically valid forever unless you move the coins on the blockchain. You should do one of the following:
1) Maintain control of the receiving address from your current transaction in case it is ever processed.
2) Use a new on-chain transaction to move the coins thus invalidating your current transaction. 


I'm sure its possible, but I don't know exactly what would be required. You might find an answer here:

In my opinion, with adoption on the mainnet where hub operators actually get paid, there will be more hubs and more routing options. Routing options scale quickley. If there are two connected hubs, there is one routing option. If there are ten connected hubs, there are 1000+ routing options. Obviously that isn't perfect because every node won't connect to every other, but I don't see it being easy to manipulate especially with hubs dispersed all over the world. I could be wrong, but I am not particularly worried about 2nd layer centralization.
I am not saying that this is a perfect solution, just that I haven't seen a better one.

Can you post your transaction ID? Or look it up on blockchain.info? What was your fee in sat/B?
Bitcoin fees are based on the size of the transaction in bytes. The size is largely determined by the number of inputs and outputs.
Your first transaction was made up of many small deposits. Combining them resulted in a large/complex/expensive transaction. 
Now that all those small outputs have been combined, into a single balance, any subsequent transaction should be much less expensive.

In my opinion, scaling for mass adoption will cause some centralization no matter what. 
The difference is that Bcash is doing it on the main blockchain. The Bcash blockchain is already more centralized than Bitcoin on miners, nodes, and developers. That trend is likely to continue. 
LN will have hubs. This is certainly a form of centralization, but on a 2nd layer which is governed by a robust decentralized blockchain. I would rather have that robust base layer. In my opinion any coin attempting 100% on chain scaling is a mistake in the long term.
An analogy that is reposted a lot is that Bcash scaling is like adding lanes to a highway while bitcoin scaling is like developing teleportation. Bcash scaling works great today, but it is shortsighted and will quickly be obsolete once LN is adopted.

You will be able to go straight to Ledger (doing this will also save you fees). You can choose if you want to keep using mycelium or not. What many people do is hold most of their coin offline in "cold storage" like in a Ledger(or trezor, or paper wallet). Then they use a mobile app like mycelium for a small amount in a "hot wallet". It is easier to spend from mycelium if you aren't in front of your computer. It is up to you if you want to do that. 
The reason is that a hot wallet is generally less secure(though still pretty safe). The idea is to have some readily accessible funds for spending while keeping the bulk of your savings a secure as possible.

I do see your point, and If there were legitimately only one hub or a small limited number, then I would agree. But, the network incentives anyone to set up a hub. IMO, there will be more hubs than there are full nodes today because hubs will earn a small income. People running nodes currently are doing so at a loss.
The underlying decentralized blockchain enforces the rules keeping everyone on upper layers honest. Even if there are a few big hubs at exchanges/payment processors, I believe that it will remain impossible to control effectively.

Short answer:
Look here: 
Currently transactions around 140Sat/B are clearing. Use a little more if you are in a rush. A little less if you can wait a while. 
Long answer/explaination:
Bitcoin fees are based on the size of the transaction(in the computer memory) not value so nobody can give you an accurate fee without knowing the size of your transaction. 
This is oversimplifying, but lets say you have 'wallet A' and 'wallet B' and 'wallet C'. Wallet A has 5 bitcoin that it received in a single transaction and now you want to send that money to wallet B. The transaction looks like this:
"wallet A sends these 5 bitcoin to wallet B"
Now if wallet A had received those bitcoin in a bunch of little pieces across many transactions, and also, you want to split them between Wallet B and Wallet C. The transaction looks like this:
"Wallet A sends these 1.2 bitcoin and these .8 bitcoin to Wallet B. Wallet A also sends these 2 bitcoin and these .05bitcoin and these .95 bitcoin to wallet C"
The second transaction is bigger and thus more expensive even though both move 5BTC.

Except that the underlying decentralized blockchain keeps everyone honest. 
I personally don't fear centralization on a second layer. If Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitfinex, etc. all operate as large nodes I'm ok with that. 
I pay coinbase to fund a channel with me. Coinbase has a channel with bitpay who has a channel with lots of merchants. I can then spend my money at any of those merchants without it touching the blockchain, but while still secured and guaranteed by the blockchain.
Then, after all the money has transferred from my side of the channel back to coinbase, I can either refund the channel, or close it. I have fully secured however many transactions my channel paid for(potentially thousands+) for the price of two transactions on the blockchain.

Miners are loud an hot. You probably don't want to live with one. 
Also lead times on decent hardware are often months and then it takes several more months to pay pack the initial investment and start making a profit. You might not be staying there long enough.
If you insist on doing this, you could look into mining alt-coins that can be mined on normal graphics cards. There are mining pools that will automatically convert your profits to bitcoin for you. 
Also, there is the ethical consideration that this is just kind of a dick move. You are taking money out of the hotel's pocket to put it into yours. This may or may not bother you.

After 2 weeks core nodes drop transactions by default. But node operators can set their own rules for dropping and if someone rebroadcasts a transaction the clock resets. Also, even when it is "dropped" it doesn't invalidate the transaction. Once a valid transaction has been broadcast, it can technically be processed at any time in the future.
The only way to really cancel a transaction is to move those same coins via a new transaction. Once the 2nd transaction is processed the 1st transaction becomes an invalid double spend.

No idea. Never used it. Your fees shouldn't depend on your wallet, they should depend on the state of the mempool, which is why I provided that link. Use a wallet that lets you set a custom fee.

1) Coinbase charges above market prices. Don't use coinbase. Use GDAX for lower prices and lower fees. 
2) Price discovery takes place on every exchange. Arbitrage is not instant. Every exchange will have a slightly different price.

Coinbase sucks. They don't batch transactions efficiently, they don't use segwit, and they often charge higher than necessary fees.  
However, network fees are undeniably high at the moment. They have been dropping for the last 12 hours. A "good fee" is now 400-500sat/B vs. 1000+ this morning. Hopefully that trend continues.

It is connected to the internet. The usual advice is to hold large amounts offline in "cold storage" (Trezor, Ledger, paper wallet) where security is inherently better. You can then hold a small amount in an online "hot wallet" for easier spending. 
The security of many online wallets is quite good, but they can never be as good as cold storage. You can't hack what you can't connect to.

Short answer: It has been done. It is possible. Check out Long answer: You are referring to daytrading. It is hard and it is a zero sum game. A few lucky/skillful (depending on who you ask) traders make money from a lot of inexperienced/unlucky people. The odds are overwhelmingly against you as a beginner. Don't do it. But if you do, start with a small amount and see how it goes.

Its a network, not a bunch of separate channels.

It could have gone to another user or just back to another coinbase address as their "change" (the remaining portion of the unspent output) . It's also good practice not to reuse address, so if the transaction amount+fee does not equal the exact balance they just send them self the difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:47:05
Everything is probably fine, but here are a couple more thoughts. 
1) Make sure you sent to the right address. GDAX account history for some reason doesn't show the address you sent to, but coinbase does and they are tied together. You can log into you coinbase account to see what address you sent to. Make sure its right.
2) Assuming you sent to the right address, you can enter your that address on blockchain.info and see if the transaction shows up there. If not, this confirms that it hasn't been sent.
As long as you confirm that you sent it to the right address, then you have nothing to worry about. Just wait it out. Exchange volumes have been way up lately and they are struggling to manage the load leading to long delays.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:12:32
I suspect that this is the problem. 231 satoshi/byte would have cleared in the next block for sure.
The median transaction is 226 bytes. Making the wild assumption that OP is close to that, he paid ~80 satoshi/byte. 
 currently suggests a delay of 4-58blocks at that level.

Measure your fees in sat/B, not $. Depending on exactly what price you use in the math, that fee is something like 18sat/B. That won't be confirmed anytime soon (possibly never).

There are a lot of variables here. It depends on where you transferred it from and what the miner fee was. I am going to assume you transferred from GDAX. Exchanges sometimes waits a bit to group transactions because it saves them money on their miner fees this could be a few minutes or (i have read)up to a few hours. 
Hit the refresh button (two arrows forming a circle) at the top of mycellium, if it updates and doesn't show a pending transaction, it means that GDAX hasn't sent it yet. If you do see a pending transaction, it should confirm in the next 10min or so. GDAX typically makes sure they are getting transaction in the next block.
If you sent it yourself from somewhere else, it depends on the fee you paid. It could be 10min or it could be never.

When you invest in stocks using usd, you trade the usd for the stock. You can't have both the money and the stock at the same time. Same goes for Bitcoin. If you found someone willing to sell you part of a company for Bitcoin, you wouldn't have the Bitcoin anymore. You would see returns on the stock, and they would see returns on the Bitcoin.

It is based on a block number. The reward halves every 210,000 blocks. That amount of blocks is found approximately every 4 years. 2140 is when the theoretical reward fall under 1 satoshi and thus can't be payed out.
However, the system is self balancing to average 6blocks/hour. Over a long enough time scale that average will be very consistent. Maybe call it 2140 +/- 1. Nobody currently using bitcoin needs to worry about it. 
The halving means it reward tapers down quickly. By 2050 the block reward will be &lt; .05

Have money on both exchanges so you can act simultaneously. 
For example, imagine i have 1btc and 15k usd on both exchange A and exchange B. I have 2BTC and $30k  total. 
Then,  I see that the price is $15k on exchange A and $16k on exchange B. I sell 1btc on exchange B and simultaneously  buy 1btc on exchange A. Now I have 2btc and $31k total, a $1k gain.
Then I can take my time rebalancing holdings between exchanges. Then repeat.

You could carefully open the private key side and assuming that you are not able to read it yourself, take the a couple of the best pictures you can and post them.

Really neat site! Bookmarked for future use!
For your amusement, here is a s*&amp;tty retelling of Disney's Aladdin based on what is still in my own memory after having seen it last probably 15 years ago.
Once upon a time, there was a princess with a really short sultan/father and a pet tiger. There was also this thief/peasant named Aladdin. The princess had to marry a prince. Aladdin wanted a chance with her. Also there was an evil sorcerer named Jaffar(sp?). He had a parrot. 
Somehow Jaffar sent Aladdin into this magic cave full of treasure and Aladdin found a lamp with a genie in it. The genie was willing to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin used one of this wishes to become a price so he could court the princess and went off to meet her. 
So here is where it gets fuzzy...
Jaffar wanted something... maybe the genie for himself and/or possibly to marry the princess? Then some stuff happened. There was a magic carpet. I think that there was a magic fight with the genie/jaffar. I think jaffar ended up being swallowed by the sand. 
Anyway... At the end, Aladdin and the princess end up together and the genie is freed from his lamp.
The end. 
**TL/DR: I don't remember the plot of Aladdin.**

The "remove the stuff that isn't water" step is harder than the the photo from the tutorial. There is a lot more splashing/overlap. If you wanted to pay more, I could spend more time on it and make it look a bit better, but here is my 'might get $7' version.

'Clearer' is relative. The general argument given for bits Is that we should standardize to one unit. It then compares the extremes and argues that expressing small amounts in BTC is bad and confusing.
Which makes more sense to you:
"I bought a television for one million bits."
"I bought a coffee for eighty five ten thousandths of a bitoin."
If you believe that we should standardise to one unit, then you should decide which is worse. 
My opinion is that we should talk in BTC for anything over .01BTC and bits for anything less. All other BTC units should be abandoned. People seem to understand dollars and cents well enough, I think we would be alright with one large and one small unit.

Yes those are the "real" Bitcoin (The M0, currently the only Bitcoin that exist). Fractional reserve allows the creation of an M1+ money supply which effectively creates more money.
If I deposit 1btc into my bank and then my bank uses 90% of it to give you a loan for 0.9 btc which you deposit in your bank, we've just "created" 0.9btc. If your bank then uses 90% of that to make another loan, the process can continue making more M2 money. The actual amount of money created depends on the reserve rate.

Do so carefully. This can be a good way to lose friends and make BTC look bad if you go overboard. 
If you bring it up and they don't seem interested, let it go. You can't win them all over. 
Also, 'small' is obviously a relative term, but don't throw pennies at them, make it at least a few dollars worth for a new user.

You are going to pay a more using PayPal and localbitcoin. Localbitcoin prices usually run high, and you will probably pay an additional premium for the risk the seller accepts by using PayPal. It would take longer, but if you can, transfer out of PayPal to a bank account. Then you have lots of options.

Because circle is new, their fraud prevention algorithm is pretty aggressive. What is likely to happen is that they will contact you asking you to submit a scan of your photo ID and/or other documentation proving who you are. They will probably get your card hooked up eventually, but it will probably take a while.
 If you are unwilling to provide additional personal info or are unwilling to wait, send them a note expressing your disappointment, telling them you have changed your mind about setting up an account, and requesting the account be closed. Then, head on over to Coinbase.

They are pretty, but not particularly useful IMO. The value of a physical coin is the value of whatever Bitcoins are stored on it + the value of the metal it's made out of. Then, you will pay a large markup because it is pretty. I'd rather store more BTC on a cheap paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:45:29
The trouble is that most "good news" so far has been merchant adoption. As many have pointed out, merchants convert BTC to FIAT immediately creating a downward pressure on the price. 
Circle could be different. Circle doesn't have great merchant tools currently. So for the time being, it could drive consumer adoption creating an upward pressure on price. (Assuming the consumers don't immediately spend all the BTC with merchants who convert back to FIAT)
Merchant adoption will create downward pressure on the price short term but is good for BTC long term.

Came to say this. If your payment processor(s) sees the fee, they will almost certainly make you stop charging it.
Unfortunately, I expect that the fee would be more effective in getting people to switch than the a discount. I think the number of people outraged by having to pay an additional 3% fee would be far greater than the number of people excited about a 3% discount.
In my opinion, the fee would be better at getting people to switch and therefore be better for BTC (if you can get away with charging it), but it may cost you some customers. The discount however, is probably better for your business.

I think 'scams' is a strong word. I have used freebitco.in quite a bit. They let you play once per hour. At current rates you will have to play roughly 10 times to hit their withdrawal limit. Then you will get paid to your personal address on Sunday morning. 
However, you will probably never make any real money and they are not really worth your time. That site pegs their reward values to USD so calculations below are based on USD. If you play once per hour, 8hours per day, every day. you would make an average of $1.52/week. Most weeks won't be that high though. That number results from the top reward being very high and pulling up the average despite being very rare. 
If you neglect the top reward(assume it will never happen) the weekly average would be $0.40. This is a more realistic number because chances are that you will lose interest before you ever win the $200 top reward and most weeks will be even lower than this split only between the bottom two rewards.
However, like anything probabilistic, you could always get lucky!
Rewards(USD),         Odds
.002    ,                   .9885

One interesting thing about bitcoins is that coins are not kept whole. They are divisible down to 0.00000001BTC ('1 shatoshi')
This is similar to how $1.00 can be broken down into $0.01. 
So... 0.00000001BTC is the minimum that can be stored at an address, but there is no maximum. 
You can have as many coins as you want associated with one private key.

I am in the process of my first order through purse.io now, so I am by no means an expert, but here is how the process has worked so far.... 
The site requires very little information, just an email, but you have to have an Amazon account. You set up a wish list on Amazon and share the wish list with purse. The one bad thing is that Amazon makes the name and city of the shipping address public. Potential buyers will be able to see it. 
Then you select the desired discount. Purse has rolled out a new tiered system where your max discount is dependent on your number of previous transactions. First timers are limited to 8%. 
The price is not locked in when you place the order. They require you to place 15% above market price into your purse account to make sure the order can be filled even if the price moves. Then the price is locked when someone accepts the order. 
The buyer then orders the item from the wish list and the price in btc goes to escrow. Whatever is left over in your purse account can be withdrawn back to your wallet at this point. 
Then you get an email asking you to confirm the shipment, releasing the coins from escrow once the item has been received. This is where I'm at, waiting for my order to arrive.

There are several thing that narrow down the possibilities.  First, the first two characters of a private key are '5H', '5J', or '5K'. 
Second there are several repeated characters. For example you have 3 'k' characters. These characters can be interchanged without changing the key, for example k3k is still k3k even if you switch the ks. 
We know that the first character is a 5 and that the second character is either an H or a K because you don't have a J. Assuming I counted correctly, taking known and repeated characters into account, the total number of permutations is:
2 x (49!)/((4 x 3!)*(3 x 2!)) = 8.4483592e+60
This is several orders of magnitude less than what was calculated above, even so It won't be cracked. If I generated 1,000,000 addresses per second, It would take me 2.6771829e+47 years to crack.
If you scramble just part of the address it would take less time. But, there are unknowns in calculating it. For example, if you just do the first 10, I may or may not know if the second character is the H or the K there also may or may not be repeated characters. As an exercise, I will assume that I don't know the second character and that there are no repeats. That would give me
2*8! = 80,640 options. That could be cracked quite quickly with brute force. So, if you want to post a version with just 10 scrambled I'm up to the challenge ;)
Edit: I did not count correctly... I think it is right now

So I did some math :( Based on the Progress% increase over one minute  and 50min, It will take on average ~20,000 years to reach 50% (where it becomes officially likely that it has been solved) at the current network size.
This means that if OP needs to seriously increase his network in order to have a chance. I however, am already contributing as much as I can.
There are ~~three~~ four possible scenarios.
1) The network stays near its current size and we never win
2) The network increases 20,000x (enough to solve it in the next year[probably]) and OP keeps his 50/50 split with the solver. But, my contribution won't increase, meaning that my chances of being the solver are basically 0.
3) The network increases 20,000x (enough to solve it in the next year[probably]) and OP distributes the prize by work %. My contribution still won't increase, meaning that my payout will be basically 0. 
4) Network increases but OP is a dirty liar and keeps it all for himself
Based on my current(approximate) 40% of OP's network, and the proposed 20,000x increase, my probable payout in cases 2&amp;3 would be ~200 bits.
I put the probability of the cases like this(total guesses):
Case1:97% 0 payout
Case2:1% 200bit payout
Case3:1% 200bit payout
Case4: 1% 0 payout
Overall expected winnings 4bits.
I'm sorry OP. Good luck in your quest, but I'm out. Not worth  burning up my CPU.
Also, if you have access to your network stats you can watch it drop off by ~40% in 3,2,1...

This is what I generally do. However, in some wallets (for example, Armory in expert mode) you can specify a change address(your new paper wallet). This would mean you would only need one transaction rather than two.
Also, as I said, I have multiple paper wallets with smaller balances to help with this. That way I don't ever have to move all my money at once, and if one paper wallet is compromised I don't lose everything.
For more on change see this thread: [
You can also use Mycelium cold storage spending to spend from a paper wallet and leave a balance on the wallet. However, It is much less secure than moving the balance to a new wallet. See video on how it works: [

- You must use a bank account previously unused on BitQuick
- You must use either a local credit union, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bank, Capital One, PNC Bank, Citibank, TD USA or SEPA transfer to qualify
- **Order must remain priced at 10% or lower of BitFinex last price**
- Order must remain live for 1 full business day or sell out
- If you list 1-2.99 BTC you will receive $5 or 0.013 BTC (whichever is greater)
- If you list 3+ BTC you will receive $10 or 0.03 BTC (whichever is greater)
Do they really mean you have to price your coins 10% below market price?
If so, you sell 3BTC for 10% below market and lose out on ~$120 at current prices.... get $10 back
No thanks
Edit: based on the reply below this seems reasonable... wording of the conditions is awkward.

It is difficult. Because of PayPals chargebacks policies, almost nobody will sell for PayPal. There is a small chance that you could find someone to sell for PayPal on localbitcoin.  However, you will pay well above market rate. 
The far better option  is to transfer out of PayPal to a bank account. Then you can buy via the exchange of your choice.

BTC transactions on the block chain can't be reversed. If your friend has moved the BTC out of circle to an address for which he holds the private keys, then circle can't touch them.
However, if the funds are still in a circle account, circle could take them. The balance on your circle account isn't actually the balance of an address on the block chain and you don't actually have the private keys or any power over it. The circle balance is tracked by circle's internal systems. You trust circle to track it properly and have BTC available when you request them. Because they control everything, they could, if they wanted to, take the coins.

**My suggestion:**
At the bottom of your site in the information section add a "submit your review" link. Near the top of the site in the menu bar add a "customer reviews" section to feature positive reviews for new customers to read.
Then, include a note in all order confirmation emails. 
Something along the lines of:


Then the 'click here' button would link to the new 'submit review' section of the website. In that section there would be a description of the process (how they might be paid, how you will use the review, legal disclaimer, etc.) and two entry fields. One for the URL where the review can be found and one for a BTC address. 
You would review submissions and post excerpts from or links to positive reviews in the previously mentioned 'customer reviews' section of the site. You could sent BTC to the address provide for reviews you really like.

I'm guessing you bought a 1BTC Casascius coin and that your physical coin is backed by the 1BTC stored at the address you linked. 
If that is the case, the 100BTC transaction was Casascius funding 100 physical coins which they then sold to various people. The fact that some of those other coins have moved means that some other people pealed the hologram off their coins and retrieved the actual bitcoin.
This makes those other physical coins essentially worthless (because they are no longer backed by a bitcoin on the blockchain), but will not affect the physical coin you have. So, if my assumption in the first line is correct, you have nothing to worry about.

I see that there is a pricing table link that doesn't work yet. You say that there are no fees for transaction and payment processing. I assume this will be clarified at a later date with the pricing table, but where do you intend to charge fees/make money.
Also, where did those merchant adoption stats come from? They are way higher than I would have guessed.
Maybe add something about what I as a merchant will need to do. Do I need a new payment terminal? new software? etc.
I would need to understand the process better to make an educated decision to go with you over another service.
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:51:42
There are fees now. [
But, the fees are very low. The thought is that as the value of bitcoins goes up and the block reward goes down, these fees will make it worth the miner's effort to process the transactions. However, it is possible that the fees would have to increase eventually depending on how things develop. But we won't really know for many years.

What wallet are you using?
As pointed out, certain wallets use a seed to generate a new address for each transaction. They often only display that newest unused address and keep track of used addresses in the background. 
If you had a transaction to the address you saw yesterday, your wallet may have generated a new unused address to display.
Your wallet probably contains many used addresses. You can still spend from the wallet and it will pull from any of the old background addresses as necessary.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:39:28
The thought is that it will be easier to understand for the general public. With bits we can work in whole numbers for typical transaction amounts. It is easier to understand buying a coffee for 8800bits than 0.0088BTC. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:22:18
This is a question you have to answer for yourself. The thought is obviously that coins in a hot wallet are much more likely to be lost or stolen. Cold storage contains a larger amount that you want to keep really safe. You have to decide how much you are comfortable keeping in your hot wallet.
The question is similar to 'How much cash are you comfortable carrying on your person?' or 'How much could you lose without being extremely pissed?'

1) You are "jumping through hoops" setting things up. I am sure you did plenty of paperwork/verification when opening your brokerage account and also the bank account or whatever else you are using to fund it. Setting up a coinbase account and a personal wallet is similar to setting up the brokerage account and bank account respectively. After you have set it up once, it will be fairly easy to use.
2) Coinbase is only slightly closer to "some random person." than your brokerage is. Your brokerage probably has a longer history of trustworthiness, but coinbase is very reputable.

It is probably spam advertising. If you look up the transaction on blockchain.info there will probaly be a note advertizing somthing. 
They send dust transactions to as many active addresses as they can find hoping that the owners of those addresses will investigate the transactions and then click through to whatever they are selling.

The answer is possibly...
1)Your friend would need to buy BTC (there will probably be small fees here depending on the method used to buy). 
2)Send BTC directly to his family (fee ~$0.04)
3)His family would probably need to get their local currency back out of the BTC. (again there will probably be small fees)
I can't vouch for any of them, but here are a couple exchanges:
He needs to figure out what the fees would be using his prefered buying and selling methods, then figure out if it would save him money.

Mycelium HD wallets creates a new address for each transaction. It created a new unused address to display as soon as the first address was used. 
Are you seeing 0 balance for the whole HD wallet in the accounts tab? Or are you just seeing 0 balance for the new address? 
If it is just for the new address, you have nothing to worry about. Mycelium keeps track of used addresses in the background. If you spend from the wallet, it will pull from those addresses as necessary.

Typing or scanning the public key is fine. No risk there. 
When spending from a paper wallet, the best way to make sure you don't lose the change is to move the whole balance so that there is no change. To this end I recommend splitting your cold storage over multiple paper wallets. This makes it more convenient to move the whole balance and also limits your losses if one wallet becomes compromised. 
If you want to move a partial balance, use mycelium cold storage spending, or make sure you know how your wallet handles change.

Others have said this, but he probably shouldn't keep that amount in coinbase. He should set up an additional wallet.
Before he buys, please have him educate himself on cold storage methods (Hardware Wallets, Paper Wallets, Armory Offline, etc.) and choose his favorite method. He should have his prefered method of offline cold storage set up before he buys and then transfer the coins there as soon as possible.
For that amount it is almost certainly worth investing in a hardware wallet or dedicated offline computer.

I didn't really dig down into all his clarifications, references etc. so I may have missed something. But, on the surface, I don't see anything wrong with it. My TLDR version:
Mining rewards cause inflation, this reduces the effective value of the existing currency. This is the cost we pay rather than a direct fee.
My response is that this is basically true right now. The mining reward is a necessary evil to build up the network and create/distribute the currency at the beginning. Over time, the mining reward decreases. The theory is that  transactions will increase to the point that transaction fees will provide adequate mining incentive at a very low fee per transaction. The currency will slowly transition from wildy inflationary to slightly deflationary if everything works out as intended.

I agree that your transaction didn't take place until today, and this will be my last post because I don't expect to change your mind. However, It took place in accordance with the terms and the price you agreed to on the 30th. At that time you stated that you would like to exchange $200 for .xxx BTC.
They are merely honoring your agreement and giving you exactly what you asked for.
I will repeat my previous hypothetical. If the price had gone up instead of down and they had given you $225 worth today, would you be insisting that they had give you too much money? If so, your argument is valid and you are just interpreting the situation differently than I am.  If not, then your complaint is invalid.

1) Generate paper wallets using an offline program on an offline copy of linux on an offline computer printed via an offline 'dumb' printer.
2) Get a hardware wallet
There are plenty of opportunities to screw up making your own paper wallet. It may be less expensive than a HW wallet if you already own the necessary items (Thumb drive, dumb printer, maybe a dedicated offline computer depending on how paranoid you are). But getting a HW wallet is easier and more 'idiot proof', So I'd recommend that route.
Whatever you do, be sure to make a couple backups and store them in multiple secure locations.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:38:44
This is a place to buy BTC with amazon credit. I would also recommend purse.io. Although it may take some time/many orders to get through $15k worth. This is your best bet unless you get lucky and find someone willing to work with you on localbitcoins. 
As far as cold storage, there are 3 good choices IMO...
1) paper wallets; somewhat complicated to set up correctly but probably the least expensive option. If you choose paper wallets take the time to learn to do it right.
2) an offline computer running armory or the wallet of your choice; good if you have an old laptop lying around. Use the computer only for this, never connect to the internet.
3) hardware wallet; Trezor, HW1, etc. These are easy to use (more idot proof). You will have to buy the hardware upfront, but this is my recommendation. $119 for a Trezor is worth it to secure $15k 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:32:59
I think the strongest argument is to look at USD. The base unit for USD is set by the US government. It is currently $.01, but from 1793 to 1857 it was $.005. When the half penny was discontinued, the scarcity/value of the USD did not jump. 
So, if bitcoin is just a currency, the base unit shouldn't affect value.
If however, services evolve on top of the blockchain using BTC simply as access tokens, then there would be companies buying BTC just to do business. The demand these companies generate would be driven by the minimum required "to be able to access the bitcoin blockchain" So, if that minimum goes down, then the demand from those theoretical future services would decrease which could decrease overall demand and therefore price.
**TL;DR:** If BTC evolves as a currency, splitting the base unit isn't deflationary. If it evolves as just a way to access the blockchain, then it is.

There is still some speculation here... but it appears at this point that the hacker just moved the coins and hasn't sold anything yet. I don't believe that there has been any "selling stolen coins". Selling stolen coins is difficult and risky and probably won't take place on the usual exchanges.
Also, the price tanked well before this hack was public, so at this point I would say that this hack has had very little effect on the price. 
Bitstamp may or may not have to buy more to replace the lost coins and this may or may not affect the price.

@_date: 2015-01-05 17:58:32
**As far as if it is a good idea...**
I don't know. I believe that in the long term price will go up, but acknowledge the possibility that it may not. The usual advice here is invest only "what you can afford to lose". If that 10k is a small percentage of an otherwise diverse portfolio and he believes that the price is likely to go up in the future then go for it. If that 10k is every penny he has, then consider diversifying a bit.
**As far as where to buy...**
This depends on where you live, but in the US, use coinbase or circle. Depending on his account level at coinbase (and certainly for a new account at circle) he would have to spread the buy out over a few days (weeks). However, this is good practice anyway to achieve some price averaging.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:46:36
This is good advice. 
If you intend to spend it soon, keep whatever small amount you need in a mobile wallet (mycelium or bread wallet are best IMO).
If you don't intend to spend it soon, or for larger amounts, offline is the way to go. If you are going to make paper wallets make sure you do some research into how to do it properly. There are plenty of ways to make mistakes. If you don't want to put in the effort or are nervous about it, the offline computer and especially the hardware wallets are more 'idiot proof'.

Blockchain has a good track record, but I still think my coins are safer in a wallet fully under my control. It is good practice to keep the majority of your holdings in offline cold storage (paper wallets, hardware wallets, armory offline, etc.) You can then keep a small amount in a hot-wallet (preferably still one you control such as bread wallet or mycelium)

I assume that they didn't want to give an exact number because they were still counting and/or because the number was still increasing. (There were a few smaller transfers after the main hack.)
This means that they needed some ambiguity and had to choose between  saying either 'approximately X' or 'less than X'. I would have made the other choice, but no big deal either way. I am guessing that the total will be very close to 19k when a more detailed statement is made.

Technically you are correct. However, there was the address with 18,xxx coins that appeared to be part of the hack and bitstamp made an official announcement of "less than 19,000 BTC". The numbers line up.
Also, there were plenty of posts on here from people saying that coins from their bitstamp deposit address moved to that big wallet. Usually, anecdotal internet evidence isn't the strongest, but considering everything that has happened I think we are alright making the assumption that "~18K BTC is actually gone/stolen".

$30 is approximately equal to $500 million / number of coins in existence 
He is assuming each coin moves exactly once per day. 
Bad assumption for two reasons. 
1) many coins are lost and can't move. 
2) each coin can move many times a day. ~~(a coin can only move once per block, there are an average of 144 blocks per day)~~ coins usually only move once per block because people like to wait for confirmations, however they could move more often. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:52:36
I'll break down some of the jargon and then circle back around to your question:
We keep track of bitcoins on a digital ledger called the 'blockchain'. 
Within the blockchain coins are associated a 'public addresses'. 
Each public address has a corresponding 'private key'
In order to spend or move bitcoins you need to have access to the private key.
Keeping the private key on a piece of paper instead of on a computer keeps it safe from hackers and viruses. This is the main reason why physical paper wallets exist.
A paper wallet typically has the public address, the private key, and a QR code for each one.
The QR codes can be easily read by a phone or computer. As pointed out, typing 52 characters by hand would be time consuming and the likelihood of making an error would be high. The QR code lets you capture the addresses quickly and accurately.

This is neither fun nor meaningful. Both BTC and troy ounces are arbitrary choices of units. This type of comparison is only valid if both things are measured in the same unit or at least units that have a conversion rate (i.e. liters and gallons).
For example, saying that there is more volume of ocean water than motor oil in the world is meaningful. They can both be measured in the same unit. There can even be a valid comparison if different units are used (i.e. liters and gallons) because there is a conversion rate between the two.
Comparing BTC to gold in the way you did is meaningless because I could change my units and the relationship would reverse:

You entered you deposit and 'bought' bitcoins on the 30th. When you made the deposit, you agreed to the price at that time. 
You have the same amount of BTC that you would have had if the transaction went through properly.
If the price had gone up instead of down since then, you would have been excited to have them honor the order as it was written. You can't have it both ways.

There are copies of the blockchain stored on computers all over the world. The network has to agree on the official version. Deleting a copy is no problem because there are thousands more. If someone modifies their copy unilaterally, the network rejects and ignores it.
As the other user pointed out using the sex tape example, deleting something with many distributed copies, is essentially impossible.
Bitcoin works without a central authority, there is no one place to hack. If any computer(s) or file(s) gets hacked or try to fool the network, everyone else just starts ignoring them.
TL:DR... If the blockchain is gone, it is because the earth drifted into the sun and we have bigger things to worry about.

All transactions have a 'priority' determined by the size of the transaction and how long it has been since those specific coins moved last.
Miners can choose whether or not to process any given transaction. Fees are optional but are an extra incentive for that transaction to be processed. 
High priority transactions will be processed quickly even if there is no fee. Low priority transactions will be processed eventually even if there is no fee, but it could take weeks. (I personally include a small fee on all transactions, even high priority, just to be sure)
more info:[
**TL;DR:** Attaching a fee is technically optional, but if you don't pay a fee (especially on a low priority transaction) it will take a very long time to process.

1) There are lots of these ponzi sites popping up. They are not scams as long as they are upfront about how they work and what they are doing. By "investing" you are basically gambling that someone else will "invest" after you. You are betting that these future "investments" will cover your investment, your earnings, and whatever fees the site operators are taking. But, inevitably there is a last investor or set of investors who are left holding the bag and lose all their money.
2) They don't want to deposit from a web wallet because they return "earnings" to the address that made the original "investment". Many web wallets keep track of your personal balance off-chain and send and receive transactions from their own wallet/addresses. This mean's that just sending back to the depositing address won't work.

Coinbase USD wallets are approaching this goal. I believe that you still have to buy BTC using funds from the USD wallet before you can spend BTC, meaning that it is two transactions instead of one. However, you can hold funds in the USD wallet until you are ready to spend BTC, then buy BTC and imediatly spend/use it. 
Funds in a USD wallet are also FDIC insurred. Although this service is only avalible in select US states currently.

Not really. The companies who do sell physical bitcoin storage have either build up a strong reputation and people generally trust them (Casascius) Or they let users choose their own encrypted private key (woodwallets). 
Granted, neither of those companies is doing paper wallets. The appeal in those cases is the storage device itself.

DCA partially insulates you from any short term price change that happens within the time you are buying. If BTC had gained 46%, you would only have gained 25% and would be upset about it.

But to your point, the network automatically adjusts difficulty so that a new block is mined on average every 10 minutes. The  difficulty is inversely proportional to the total power of the network. The only way to decrease difficulty is to get some miners to quit mining.

Thank you for sharing. I believe you've saved me from myself.
Post fork, I traded my BCC for BTC near the first low ~.08 thinking it would keep sliding. When it turned the corner, I swapped a small amount back. Then it tanked again and I sold at a loss. 
I thought I might trade some alts just to get back what I had lost. In a week of trading, I have done slightly worse than breaking even. (I consider myself lucky that it isn't worse)
I missed out on a lot by waiting too long to dump BCC and since then I have only made things worse.
Your story and my recent experience have reminded me that I am not in fact smart enough to make decisions that will beat the market. Holding is the better strategy. Luckily my losses have been small. I still have more BTC than I did pre-fork. I'd like to keep it that way. I just pulled all of my funds off the exchange. Thanks friend. Sorry for your loss.

Only if you use it. To send a segwit transaction, your coins need to be first moved to a segwit address by a non-segwit transaction. Then, using your new address your viable fees should be slightly lower. If enough people do this, blocks will be less crowded and fees will decrease further. Lightening network could effectively decrease fess even more long term. This is a marathon not a sprint. The immediate impact is very small.

Basically, it doesn't work like that. Fees are based on the weight(not the value) of the transaction and how busy the network is at any given time. A full explanation is a bit long. I'm sure you can google an explanation of how bitcoin fees work faster than I can type one.
However, unlike credit card payments, the fee is payed by the sender not the receiver. So, if you are receiving bitcoin in payment for your goods, your fee is always 0.

Miners (almost) always mine the highest fee transactions. Newer transactions with high fees get mined before old transactions with low fees. Blocks have (almost) all been full.

First, don't fool yourself... Bitcoin has a ton of potential, but it is still highly speculative with a lot of risk. There are many valid reasons to be skeptical.
But to answer your actual question... psycology
Your friends may be more risk averse than you. They are just inherently more likely to focus on risks than potential upside. 
Some people are naturally innovators/early adopters who always want to try something new and challenge the status quo. Some people are naturally laggards who will only try something after they see that everyone else is already doing it. 
They just think differently than you. Ease up and don't push them. Incessant pitching is a hallmark of many scams and is likely off putting. If they aren't interested now, just give them time.

The white paper says very little about scaling: 
Satoshi discussed both a block size change and layered systems outsize the white paper. 
All that said... IMO anyone claiming that we must rigidly adhere to the whitepaper or "Satoshi's vision" is making a mistake. Satoshi was a visionary inventor not a prophet or a god. The whitepaper is a technical paper, not a religious text. We need to pursue the best solutions, not just blindly follow the first draft. Obviously "best" is up for debate.

1) No. Nearly every block in the last 5 hours(since the mempool spike) has been completely full except for two that were empty.  
2) No. You can't cancel bitcoin transactions. They removed from the mempool via mining. At the same time, terrible fee estimators are still paying 40+.
3) This "event" is no big deal. The mempool is already back under 10MB If the trend continues, it will be clear again in a few hours. 
4) I'm not saying spamming doesn't happen, but everyone needs to stop screaming spam at every little spike. When the mempool is basically empty, it is not unreasonable for someone wanting to defrag to push a bunch of low fee transactions.

Network centralization is a spectrum:
LN will have hubs. It already does. But as long as there are enough of them, transactions can route around any bad actors. Financial intensives exist for running well connected hubs, so I expect that there will be many hubs. LN will resemble "decentralized" in the linked image, though hopefully with more connection between hubs for better routing options.  
Also, IMO scaling necessarily involves some centralization. Large blocks put that centralization on the base layer leaving only that centralized control to enforce the rules. Even a fully centralized LN(unrealistic extreme) would be governed and backed by the decentralized bitcoin base layer. This is one of the primary reasons I support off chain scaling and on chain optimization.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:32:44


The blockchain is not the market. On-chain transactions don't affect the price
When most people say "off chain transactions" they mean a second layer like lightning network that is still tied to the base blockchain. 
What you are describing is just buying private keys. This is 100% insecure and a good way to lose money, because the seller has both the payment and the BTC private keys. There is nothing to stop the seller from keeping and spending both. 
What you are looking for is called "over the counter"(OTC) trading. It takes place outside the exchange marketplaces so that it doesn't move the market price but it still requires a bitcoin blockchain transaction to transfer ownership of the BTC.

Handling payment systems requires time and money and risk. Each individual business in never going to invest that time and money and independently take that risk when they can outsource it.
I hope some better payment options for businesses emerge over time.

You can't. If it were that easy all prices would be static. If your coin offers some utility, you can try to value that utility and then divide by the supply, but getting an accurate estimate will be difficult to say the least. If your coin doesn't offer some utility, the answer is probably 0.

Businesses outsource stuff so that they can focus on their core competency. They use distributors, accounting services, janitorial services, payment processors, etc. to improve their own operations. Trying to handle all the ancillary tasks themselves is just inefficient. Payment processors etc. let them focus where they should be: on design, manufacturing, and marketing. 
It is your right to not do business with them, but I think you are being a bit ridiculous. Like any business they are just doing what is best for their bottom line. Bitcoin is free and open. IMO there is no wrong way to use it.
Companies want to focus their business not securing payment systems. This is just never going to change.

There is not a set number of transactions per block... 
Transactions have a size (weight) to them. Each block can fit up to 4MB of transaction weight.  So they can fit a few hundred high weight transactions or a few thousand low weight transactions or a medium amount of a mix of the two.

Ive never been involved in a bitcoin loan, I have no idea what the going rate is.
But, in general riskier assets require a higher rate of return. Bitcoin involves more risk than real estate. If bitcoin gains adoption and becomes less risky rates go down.
Plus, for the loan to be worth it, the loan issuer needs to earn a higher return than the probable rate of return of just holding. The return on holding USD is -2%. The last two months excluded, the return on holding bitcoin has been pretty good.

The idea you are trying to get at is "orphaned blocks". 
Miners decide what to include in the blocks that they are working on. It is possible that two miners discover two potentially valid blocks at roughly the same time. In this case, any given node might choose either one as the valid.
However, when the following block is found, it will have been build on one of the prior two. At that point, the network will permanently accept the one it was built on. The one it wasn't built on will be orphaned. 
Each new block provides a confirmation that every block before it won't be orphaned. This is why people often recommend waiting for a few confirmations before considering a transaction fully settled.
This video is a little long, but its worth it to understand how the network functions.

You give someone money for a mining hashrate and a period of time, then they mine at that hashrate for that period of time and give you any earnings. 
However, you probably won't be able to find a profitable cloud mining platform. Think about it: If you could make money from cloud mining, the mining operator could just keep the coins themselves and make more money without involving you. They operate cloud mining services because you will pay in more than they will pay out back to you.
IMO the best advice is to just buy coins directly from an exchange/localbitcoins/etc.
However, there are two reasons that you might choose to mine:
1) You are just interested in the technology and want to be involved without really making a profit. (In this case buy a cheap USB miner and have at it)
2) You are ready to invest 10s of thousands of dollars, do a ton of work, and set up shop as a real business venture.
That said, if you are set on cloud mining, only you can answer your second question. Decide what 'a decent payout' means and then google 'bitcoin mining calculator' and use any of the resulting calculators to see what hashrate you would need to get your desired payout.

Anything with an appropriate processing chip could mine for bitcoins, however that mining will require additional power beyond what that device would normally use. You would have to pay for that power, so ultimately you wouldn't gain anything. 
The only possible exception is replacing your furnace or heater with a bitcoin miner. Mining is horribly inefficient and in addition to bitcoins, it produces a ton of heat. Most miners see this heat as a waste product and have systems in place to remove it. However, some people in cold climates use that heat as a useful byproduct and treated their miners as a space heater. They mine for bitcoins while lowering their heating bill as a bonus.
So basically, the answer to your question is almost always no.

No. It is the opinion of nearly everyone on this sub that the price will continue to increase. However, you should never hold 100% of your savings in one asset. You need to be diversified enough that if one asset tanks you will have enough left to get by. 
Imagine the unlikely (but technically possible) scenario where someone discovers a vulnerability in the bitcoin code and the price craters. It would suck if bitcoin was all you had. 
Edit: I saw the other post stating that you have almost no expenses. You have less vulnerability than most so you can "safely" invest a larger percentage in bitcoin than most. If it were me in that situation, I'd go at least half in crypto, but probably still not 100%.

Nothing very safe. If you sell BTC via paypal, the buyer can claim they never received the coin and paypal will reverse the charge leaving you with no BTC and no paypal balance. For that reason there are no exchanges which work with paypal.
However, if you are willing to accept the risk, I am sure you can find someone on localbitcoins or mycelium local trader to trade. Otherwise, if you have the time, It is much safer to switch to USD transferred to a bank account from a reputable exchange then from there to paypal.

What you need to try to understand is that nothing is ever "sent" anywhere and that bitcoins are never "on your computer". The blockchain and bitcoin iself are just a list of transactions. All bitcoins are always "stored" as entries on the blockchain and never go anywhere else. What changes is who is authorized to create new entries involving any specific coin (or portion of a coin). Bitcoins are "sent" with new entries on the blockchain. When you "send" a transaction you are authorizing the creation of that new entry involving coins you currently control. The new entry will transfer control of those coins to another private key.
