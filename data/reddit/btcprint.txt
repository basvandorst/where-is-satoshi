Do you speak for TWC as a whole and company policy? 5 years ago I woke up to find my twc connection blocked and all traffic routed to a twc notice page basically saying I'd shared copyrighted files and I had to click "agree" to some legalese sounding "I'm so sorry I'll never use torrents again" type form to get my access reinstated.  This was back when the mpaa and riaa was going apeshit.
What was most infuriating is one basically had to admit guilt to get access turned back on - no "wtf I don't know what you're talking about this has to be a mistake, maybe I should learn to put a password on my wireless network so neighbors can't use it" option.  Just "click here so we have on file you admitting your guilt, and we won't hold your connection hostage...for now"
Would have cancelled immediately save for the only other option was shitty ATT dsl.  I couldn't download all of Bieber's banging new tracks on dsl..that would be unbearable.

Yeah and you can also configure firewall rules - not to sure details but google can answer.
I also didn't like the fact the PIA software made malware bytes wig out as it constantly pings other servers, and malware bytes just pops up over and over "blocked risky connection"...could have made a rule to let it pass through but it raised an eyebrow as why those calls out were necessary - and open vpn doesn't do that.
I might try ivpn just to see how good their server speeds are.

2nd sentence is pretty much it.  Fiat is dropping much faster (look at stock markets, housing in developed markets, etc) - a parabolic drop in purchasing power for those holding fiat - not 2% annual BS.
It's right now one Satoshi (smallest divisible unit of Bitcoin" is $0.0001 USD.  Moving the decimal to the right increases value of BTC by a power of 10.  We are definitely going to see $100,000 or a complete separation from fiat pricing over time - a global wealth preservation tool irrespective of the strengths or weaknesses of any central bank and/or government's monetary policies.  How does one perceive future value, 10 years out, in those terms? 
Everyone saying "well that's $2.1 trillion, that's crazy" is significantly overestimating the 'value' of 2.1 trillion in the future.  I mean, how many trillions have been added to the national debt in the last decade like it's no big deal. Click and print.

No its a symptom of how the discussion was handled initially.  Imagine an outsider looking in on two sides of a debate. One side has control of the major communication channels and censors all discussion related to the other side.  How would this shape the views of the outsider looking in?  It's a symptom of immoral and dishonest action by the side desperately trying to control the message.  Had the debate been allowed to occur in the open there would have been many more open minds - instead, by human nature, it invokes an immediate distrust - even if their intentions were good and salient points to their argument.

What scares me about high level adoption in the future is the financiers once again setting up systems for crypto (derivatives, fractional reserve banking, comex type trading markets, etc)..once we are dealing with trillions of dollars market cap that's when the real games will begin.

I gotcha. A good benchmark may be Gross World Product (like GDP/gross domestic product but for all nations combined).  Roughly 88 trillion dollars
If Bitcoin was hypothetically the only currency used globally by every nation that would put the value of one Bitcoin at or above 5 million dollars each (likely much higher, hypothetically).
A 100k USD equivalent salary in this Bitcoin only world would be paid at 0.000385 BTC per week.  Or .02 BTC per year.

No, but in the currency crisis to come, they absolutely will - at least those with any sense.  The Greek austerity measures caused a decent jump, Venezuelans who own Bitcoin survive their currency crisis, Zimbabwe traded (or still trades) Bitcoin at a HUGE premium.  
Initially all assets will go down in the next crisis in a fight for liquidity as investors go to cash and Joe schmoe liquidates his classic cars to pay rent.  Then, as it has since 1913, the purchasing power of the dollar will continue to erode,at an even faster pace over the next decade, possibly losing its hegemonic status --- then dollars will move into hard assets and inflation hedges: gold, and a fixed supply deflationary asset/currency such as Bitcoin.
Aside from gold and some commodities, there is literally no better hedge against fiat currency declines/failures than Bitcoin (or X crypto you believe can compete with Bitcoin in the future, but those you can only count on one hand).

Yeah - cashcall i think it was. I heard it a few weeks ago and it took me back to the mortgage mania of 2005-6. That ended well.
As rates go up and refis go down the lenders are gonna try anything to keep the good times rolling.

It is interesting - after the evo exit scam drk/dash significantly rose in price from buying volume.  Drk/dash has now dropped back down (selling pressure), now "whale sales" of BTC.
Think the evo admins have been doing some laundry?

as a CS prof (alleged) with an interest in electronic voting, can you envision the utility of the blockchain as a voting mechanism?  In how many ways?

I would split it 50/50. They would have never known about it or even be able to figure out how to exchange and convert to usd or local currency.

And the one doing the "forcing" was Artem, by using coinbase and not simply creating a personal wallet with mycelium, etc. 
Why would a torrent site under scrutiny use a bitcoin address generated from a coinbase wallet? Beyond me..

It's simple. If you're trying to circumvent laws (Gambling, drugs, etc) then coinbase can not help someone do that, legally.  They'd get f'ed if users constantly transferred from "their" (coinbase) wallet to a known gambling site.
As long as coinbase customers respect they can't put coinbase in that position, they won't F you. Respect means, at least xfer to separate wallet, then exchange to different crypto (monero, ethereum, etc) wit draw from said exchange into an even different wallet and then use that wallet for your fun money.
Coin base doesn't want to do this - they're forced to by stupid (ok, I'm being mean..more like noob) users thinking "bitcoin yay drugs" then not understanding the currency isn't anonymous and tracking is very easy.
If sec fbi Cia ftc cok all know analyzing one hop is simple, two hops easy....but things get obfuscated when transfered to "fresh" wallet then shapeshifted, etc.. basically all coinbase cares about is how complicit they'd look, if anyone comes a knockin. 
They don't give a fuck what you do...as long as you "don't implicate them" with you...let that sink in.
