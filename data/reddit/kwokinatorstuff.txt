It’s good to get a hardware wallet to safely store your BTC. So if coinbase got hacked or something then you are ok. 
As for the pricing..... let me try an ELI5. 
Say you want to buy Apple stock right now. And you tell your group of 10 friends you want to do so. Apple is trading around $170... but they don’t want to sell it for less than $180. So your price is $180. 
But, say you opened up a brokerage account with millions of those friends simultaneously buying and selling their Apple stock. You would no doubt find someone selling their stock at $170 (ie market stock). That means the spread is pretty thin. It has to do with trading volume. 
On coinbase. The spread is pretty wide. So it could cost $17k but your market order is executed at $17.2k
Other exchanges let you buy/sell using limit orders as well. Say you put a limit order to buy at a maximum of $17k or something like that.

I’ll buy it off you.

Yup. Also the spread is so wide on coinbase bc is liquidity.

You can probably make a little more than $35 if you let it sit a little longer ;)
Relax. Take a breath. And give it a day or two.

Why’d I expect to read about the coworker gasping for air in the bathroom; choking on a marble strategically placed in a deviled egg.. and OP standing over him whispering, “just remember, people get hurt all the time, for many reasons..”

There are also systems in place like this, on Wall Street. FYI.

Hypothetically you can transfer it from your coinbase account to one on a different exchange. And sell there.

There’s something about the “loves blows” that just cracks me up.

I’ve been jaded toward them ever since I sent a very kind Nigerian $5k so that he can clear up the paperwork stopping me from getting $10MM mysteriously left to me in someone’s will..

Wise, response it.

Credibility  -  that’s what else dips when you say statements like that. But great talk!

For an emerging leader in a forward-thinking space, one would think that baseless assumptions are bellow you..
