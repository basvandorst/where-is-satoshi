Oh, didn't know they offered a paid service. Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:43:04
Thanks, I'll try that 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:46:18
Try waiting 1 month ;)
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:26:17
That's what I'm looking to know. I don't really know what the process is of paying extra to get a transaction to go through. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:34:00
HOW IN THE HELL? 
Did you have something to do with this?
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:08:30
It's gone down in value by half lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:42
No kidding, right? Kinda worried now lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:32:30
I'll send a bunch of coin to one of those addresses, in hopes that it causes a huge family argument over favoritism. 
Just kidding, awesome gift idea. You must be loaded. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:25
Wtf, really?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:50:19
Student. 50% 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:27:43
Jesus lord please tell me you're my secret santa 
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:10:47
Man, am I ever happy I sold when I did. It's not often that you feel good about a major investment decision, but selling just before this dip makes me a happy dude. 
Keep at it, guys. I had to sell my Bitcoin because I am broke, but I firmly would have continued hodling if I was in a better financial position. Best of luck everyone, it's been a hell of a year. I may not be a hodler anymore, but I'll always be loyal to the Bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:54:58
Made lots of profit. I was a relatively early buyer. Still, with a sold around January though 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:53:54
Not as money that I can spend anywhere. I get that someday that might happen with Bitcoin but you can't use it to do your day to day shipping yet 
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:39:10
Yup, I fully expect that to happen. I may buy a little back if it drops some more, and ride it back up 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:00:55
If there is a Bitcoin ATM near you, you can use that 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:33:13
Yep 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:04:46
What just happened?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:26:12
I can't say. That being said, 5% isn't bad for ATM fees, I've seen ATM's with ridiculous 20% fees.
I'll just say this: My very first, and most profitable Bitcoin purchase was made at an ATM, when Bitcoin was at an all time high. I can't say anything about the markets now because I am awful at predicting anything cryptocurrency related. But my experience buying from ATM's has been positive. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:37:49
Dammit I gotta make some cookies now 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:23:26
And that's the issue with the dollar. A loan shouldn't be a matter of "creating dollars out of thin air" 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:25:33
Don't keep your money on coinbase, problem solved. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:24:01
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:48:14
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:46:34
Me too. Wish us luck 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:14:00
That's what's weird about it, I followed coinomi's instructions for sweeping, and even clicked the "sweep" button on the coinomi app. 
These are the steps I followed:
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:11:24
Yup, not gonna deny my question was vague. Typed it up very quickly.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:16:32
That's actually a funny point, I never thought about a Bcash fork, but I guess I don't see why that wouldn't happen. I sold my Bcash on the day of the fork
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:09
Time to buy boys!
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:32:45
I can finally breathe 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:46:37
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:47:00
Definitely. I traded my Bcash for Bitcoin, so I still benefited in some way. I'll consider hodling s2x though 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:59:51
Good luck man!
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:18:57
Let me know before you sell so I can buy the dip 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:29:53
Hmm, maybe that's all it is. I'm going to be doing it again for the s2x fork, so I'm hoping it works out the same way 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:15:40
Really weird, I think I followed coinomi's exact steps for sweeping. As far as I know coinomi doesn't support imports (but I could be wrong). See my comment above. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:13:41
What a bitch 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:14:49
I'm asking for some opinions on the best exchanges for large purchases. I've been trading Bitcoin for the past year, I'm not an idiot 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:52:46
How can the Bitcoin Gold market have any real numbers if seemingly no one is trading it?
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:17:56
Welp, let me chime in as a Bitcoin noob. 
I have less than 1. Actually less than half of one. I had so many opportunities to buy, and had a lot of people in my social circles telling me to "buy buy buy" for years. But I was too careful and waited just a little too long. 
My original investment was small. I was an unemployed student, and couldn't afford much. But thankfully, over the last several months, my investment has tripled. I'm happy about it, and plan on investing more when I'm employed again. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:15:13
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:03:36
Sorry if I sounded rude, didn't mean for it to come across that way. Just looking for people's opinions on the best platform for purchasing several thousands of dollars of Bitcoin. I put "a few" in quotation marks for a reason 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:17:15
I'll look into that, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:49:07
God I wish I had a time machine. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:17:11
Ugh. Had a bad experience with that coinbase notification thing. I set it to notify me "next time it drops below 4k Canadian" a while back. Briefly dropped below, didn't get a notification. Ended up buying higher than I wanted to. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:04:48
Sunday dip coming?
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:57:32
I would, but the emojis killed it for me. Serious offers only. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:50:34
But why do you care? Just let us be idiots in peace dammit 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:46:04
Let's cross our fingers 
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:33:53
I should have expected that hahahahaha
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:33:56
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:39:59
Same situation with me. I feel your pain dude. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:21:55
That's the boat I was on for several months. Do tons of research, and I say start with a small investment (I started with a $200 investment) just to get the hang of it. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:24:30
Why do some people insist on quoting the entire OP's post in their reply? Just reply lol 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:07:53
Serious question, I have a small amount that I recently invested. Should I pull out now, and reinvest more after the next drop? How confident are we that there will be a correction? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:20:30
This is the most stressful investment I've ever made 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:00:07
Me too
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:58:08
I think the context is self explanatory given that you're making a reply to OP's post. Also you don't have to be a passive aggressive douche about it
