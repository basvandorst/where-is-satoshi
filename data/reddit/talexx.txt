Well, he makes so many strange and unsupported claims in this article!
 For example he says that money are created using debt and that this kind of supply has no limit. It does have actually, in the worst case it can be as huge as all current deposits x 10 (it depends) but I doubt that it ever reaches such levels.
He also states that we are in a shitty situation because we have allowed bankster to print money. It is very arguable. As far as I understand we’re in a shitty situation not because of a fractional reserve system or anything of this kind but much more because government takes debt of failed entities, because of FCA, Central Banks and stuff. Failed financial instituations do not actually fail nowadays and this is bad, not our debt itself. Also there are so many kinds of debt! You cannot just name everything as simple as “debt”, call it bad, and pretend that this an article on economy. Debt is not inherently bad.
Deflationary currency is also a very controversial subject and stating that it would change everything to the best is a bold statement. It appears like inflation forces to invest and this is good for everyobody. With deflationary money we have high chances to find ourselves in the world of hodlers and stagnant economy.
If anybody is really interested in the current state of economy I would suggest to start reading some more reliable sources. Books on Economy are really boring but useful. There are also a lot of other interesting sources. For example this Congress Hearings transcript might be useful to get some understanding of what’s going on:

I agree that privacy for us vs publicity for govt would be perfect. But 'could' never works with folks in power. It should be must with no ways to avoid. I would sacrifice some of my privacy just to see how politicians and govt agencies are embarrassed and their lies and corrupt schemes are exposed. That would be really funny to follow.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:04:38
Why everybody sees the lack of privacy as something bad? Surely there are some tradeoffs that should be considered but at the same time it could help for example to eliminate corruption or watch and control how your taxes are spent.

I second this. Epistemology for instance is absolutely fantastic! It even became my hobby at some point (think I need to pay more attention to my hobby :) We can learn how to think correctly, how to filter information or try to understand how we do work at all. And if we mix it with advancements in neuroscience we probably would get even more fantastic results and tools! Such a pity that we do not pay enough attention to such things.

I have seen many self-taught devs out there. While it is often OK to make apps without any CS background using frameworks and pre-made tools, the moment you're starting to touch something more complicated/unexplored the lack of fundamental knowledge immediately pops out. Many of these self-taught folks do not have enough background in math for example to conduct gamedev, evaluate effectiveness of algorithms or create highly available and stable systems. Talking about crypto it is core &amp; p2p networking which is quite an advanced topic, huge amounts of data, tons of math on which all this stuff based &amp;c. While it is true that you can earn money without enough education, you would be not able to make something really advanced without it. Blockchain has been invented not by script kiddies, but by a real mathematician. It is not just a coincidence. I guess you can learn this everything yourself nowadays via internet and it is fine, but you need to learn and pay with your time. 6 month as a padavan making web forms would never make you a good software engineer.

Not really. Your bank accounts privacy was withdrawn a couple years ago by OECD regulations in EU and by FATCA in the US. Privacy is going away already.
I do not really see any problems with this in long term. Society would change as well. It could be considered just inappropriate. Or it could be made impossible to scrutiny your activity without leaving traces/letting you know. Such cases can be made illegal.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:01:27
Yes, you're right. Most of programmers don't deal with math on a daily basis. But at the same time most of programmers do not do anything advanced. Frankly speaking most of programmers are just code monkeys and nothing more. But I supposed we're talking not about code monkeys. Math is essential for crypto, even just to understand why it works and is viable. Data structures, statistics, hash functions, cryptohash functions, digital signatures, Merkle trees, Merkle-Damgard transformations, data bases, data integrity, how to organize your ledger, how to organize security... it is all math or math-related. Doubt that any 6-month-self-practiced kid would be ever able to invent something like this. God bless him if he would even get basic knowledge and understanding. 
I do not deny that this is possible to learn all this stuff yourself, but you need to learn. Otherwise you would produce low-quality software (if any at all) prone to bugs, attacks and imminent failures. While it can be fun for you it is absolutely irresponsible in regard to your users and their safety especially if you're dealing with money. I think that such devs often not create value but harming the industry. At the same time I agree that everything is possible and we have outstanding people who learned everything themselves. It is here as well. The problem is that you never know how excellent the particular engineer is. It is just "believe in me please". Personally I would prefer to put my trust into something like IBM's hyperledger, something made or at least checked by professional engineers with huge experience.

I do have degreee related to economics, but I do not express my opinion a lot cause I can't say that I understand this side of crypto pretty well. May be I understand more than an average Joe but it is not enough especially comparing it to my understanding of more traditional things. And I'm much more interested in crypto's technical and social sides than in pure economic models.

It looks like I've touched details but missed your point at all. Sorry for that. We do not disagree here. It creates more opportunities and benefits people. It is great. It may also make people more happy. May be after this practice someone would understand what he likes and what does not. And if likes software at all.
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:35:19
Of course. I also suggest you to consider society that functions in a different way. May be it would be not as awful as we think now. Anyway everything is going into that direction. If people striptease themselves on facebook  every day I guess most of them would not complain about such kinds of transparency as well. It might happen that privacy game is lost already. In this case I would suggest make everything as transparent as possible and wait till the moment folks in power start to scream and complain. If levels of transparency would be the same for everyone they are the first to complain for sure.

Do not care about my landlord actually. I live in a place with plenty of housing offers. If one plays unfair here would just move to another. Even leaving aside my specific case every house/apartment has its price formed by the market. Really do not understand what would happen if my landlord would know my income. Prices for apartments are usually publicly listed and you can learn about it even not meeting any landlords. Or it can be made like this by law.
On insurance companies. Do not see a big deal here as well. It would be even funny to see how McDonald's would clash with insurance companies in court as soon as something like this happens. And if you really eating too much of crap food may be it is time to stop? 
Look. You are asking your questions assuming that only privacy would go away and nothing else changes. It would not be like this at all. Privacy would not be taken away only from people in this case. You would be able to see what meat uses McDonald's and if its quality is acceptable. How much your medical care really costs. If something like this ever happens our society would be changed completely. It is pointless to guess how it would look like. Every guess is probably wrong.

I mean that is right. You should talk about inflation in terms of prices. While factors you outline might and usually cause inflation it appears that in case of Bitcoin other factors play much more important role. It seems that you're talking about monetary inflation which is exactly increase in currency supply and here you're right for the moment (it would change in the future though). At the moment we do have monetary inflation but it may or may not result in prices inflation.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:15:33
He is right. Common definition of inflation is based on change of prices, not on supply and demand of your currency. It reflects change in buying capacity of your currency units. While supply plays its role here and sometimes quite important, just a simple fact that we're increasing supply doesn't necessarily mean that inflationary processes happen or would happen. There are dozens of factors that might influence inflation rates and some of them might be much more important than supply dynamic.
