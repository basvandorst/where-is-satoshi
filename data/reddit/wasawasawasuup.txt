It's like a bank run. But for bitcoin.
I advise you don't wait. If you have money sitting on an exchange. Move it off into a wallet where you control the keys (aka. you were asked to write down some words when you set it up and asked to keep them safe). Do it today.
@_date: 2019-12-29 09:45:33
Thanks again for your suggestion. This didn't work out too well unfortunately.
The app took a while to get going, with the GUI freezing several times when I tried to use it. I could see it was trying to synchronize so I left it alone until that was all sorted and it seemed to behave after that. This needs fixing, either with an overlay saying it's setting itself up and telling me to hang tight whilst it does the work, or the application being changed so the GUI is always responsive.
After setting everything up and running a backup, I find I have a grand total of 5 offers that take my currency from two people. One of them has 4 offers, the other 1. The person with 4 offers accepts my payment method, the 1 does not accept my payment method but shows due to my currency being the filter.
Of the two people, "This account type doesn't use signing" is on the person with 4 offers, the 1 remaining is "This account hasn't been signed yet". So I assuming using signed sellers isn't an option here, unless I'm misunderstanding something.
The fees are too high. The cheapest offer is 4% over the market value (the 1 I cannot use) and the others are between 5-10% over the market value, to which I could just use a BTM down the street for similar fees and less hassle and the same amount of anonymity.
Bisq itself takes a trade fee I just learned, which would be between 0.5% to 2% of the total trade in these cases, or about half that if I used BSQ, whatever that is (and no, I'm not wanting to learn about that, I just want to buy Bitcoin, nothing more). So the actual fees are around 5-12%.
Also, no Segwit. It's nearly 2020 and no Segwit, really?
So I literally cannot buy BTC through a signed account through Bisq as there just isn't enough people using the platform. The overall experience was disappointing. That's a real shame.
Whilst I appreciate some of this is outside of Bisq's control, the experience remained, and that's what matters. I have goat shit I want to convert into Bitcoin, but it seems Bisq isn't yet the platform for me. At least, not yet.
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:10:22

It's a very old scam.
You get "free" money, but you have to pay a withdrawal fee, or the account needs a minimum balance or something like that. You pay the fee and then you never get the money.
Replace the word money with bitcoin and you have the modern twist on the scam.
Think of it this way... Why would anyone randomly give you free money? If you've given $1000 and need to pay $100 to withdraw, why can't they just give you $900 instead without you needing to pay?
It's good that you came here to ask, but also concerning that you didn't see through it immediately. You need to think critically and logically.

To add to this.... Remember it's a race. Even if the mempool is huge with juicy fees miners may elect to transmit a empty or near empty block if they find it quickly and haven't had time to fill it with transactions.
The risk of another miner finding the solution and getting the block reward probably outweighs the fees gain by spending a minute or two putting the transactions into the block.
The bitcoin protocol allows empty blocks if that's what miners want to mine. There is no consensus on the mempool.

Hi btc_forever/btc_yoda and all the others I can't remember right now. Why do you keep changing account if you just say the same thing over and over again? It's so easy to link them just by reading your nonsense because you never change the record.
Your response makes no sense. This is from the perspective of the merchant. They chose btcpay so they are obviously okay with using a third party, and currently they have decided that a third party which gives them immediate fiat payments is their best option for whatever reason (probably taxation reasons). This is called pragmatism. The "point" you're making is pointless.
Here's a news flash for you: not everyone thinks the same way as you. It's not black and white, there are shades of grey, for some people and businesses it makes perfect sense to use 3rd party solutions for some situations. In fact that's very often how businesses work. 
That's just the way it is right now. Your "ITS NOT EXACTLY HOW I WANT IT SO YOU'RE AN IDIOT" rabid fanaticism is not useful, it's not helpful, and if anything, it scares people away. Bitcoin is many things to many people. Try and find a middle ground and go from there. Be pragmatic. You've managed to do it in the past, as you've documented here, but for some reason you've lost all perspective.
Also, climate change is real. Overwhelming scientific evidence on that one.

A wholly non technical rundown:
Legacy: old addresses. Full fat. Full fees. Usually starts with a 1 (but not always. They can start with a 3 if they are multisig)
Segwit: newer addresses. Semi skimmed. A nice saving on fees. Compatible with wallets that still have not upgraded. Start with a 3.
Native Segwit. Newest address format. Skimmed. Cheapest to use of the three. Requires wallets to be aware of the address format. Most wallets will send to these addresses without any drama. Start with bc1.
Nothing stopping you from getting a Segwit and native Segwit addresses if you need. I have native Segwit on my hardware wallet, and a Segwit wallet as a "hot wallet" on my pc for the exchange I use which hasn't upgraded their software yet. As soon as I get the money in I sent to my native Segwit wallet with minimum fee. I'm never in a rush for the money so don't care about waiting.

A smaller block size could be achieved with a soft fork.
Tightening of the rules - soft fork
Relaxing of the rules - hard fork
As older nodes will still see 100kb blocks as valid, then a soft fork is absolutely fine here. Similar to how Segwit worked on a technical level.
For the record I don't think this is a good idea, but it absolutely could be done with pure bitcoin.

The project uses tor by default on everything network wise.
The premium part is connecting to your installation via tor remotely. So being able to connect electrum on your phone whilst you're not home to your installation for example. That's done via tor and that is the premium part you pay for. If you don't need or want that then obviously no worries.

Probably just an outage before everyone sharpens their pitchforks. It happens to the best of us, and bitpay certainly isn't the best of us.

Again, varies massively. These machines tend to be more expensive than using a online exchange.

Unfortunately using this also supports BitPay regardless...

It would be a pretty short list.
With a handful of exceptions, every time they are at risk of default, the government bails them out, or depositors take a "hair cut" in order or bail them out.
Not much risk, really.

Why lie about that? It's so easy to verify that you're talking utter bullshit. What's the end game here? Did you just think nobody would bother to correct you?
Bernie is alive but is likely to die of old age in jail (although if he does outlast the sentence he will be around to see the block reward go to zero!). One of his sons committed suicide. Another died of an illness.
