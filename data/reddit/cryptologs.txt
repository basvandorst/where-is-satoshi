Bitcoin is a technological concept, a protocol... so if you need to compare bitcoin with something, compare it to the internet... not hardware tech.

I do not differentiate between government censorship and self-censorship when talking about media. So yeah, what western media is doing at this day and age is maybe more subtle (in the eyes of the sheeple that is) but just as bad as CCPs Propaganda Department.

"Having Mt. Gox shut down is to bitcoin what having the New York Stock Exchange shut down is to our equity market,"
I don't know if these reporters are lazy, ignorant, incompetent or plain stupid :O

let's crowdfund it with bitcoins just to piss them off

granted it's not "Stairway to heaven" :D but she deserves an 'A' for effort \o/

not big on reading are we Sir McAnus... this thread refers to a broader analysis &amp; the author actually makes a relatively good point that another exchange will rise to the challenge, were Mt.Gox to completely fail... at this point everything is speculation.

qarl has a point... transaction malleability is something that is well known and talked about since waayy back in 2011. Instead of actually investing some of the coins flowing their way to beef up their security protocols, they blatantly chose to ignore this issue. A douche decision if you are one of the biggest exchanges around with thousands of people relying on your services... Although the whole situation is unfortunate for those who got burned, it is a valuable lesson for the crypto community. One which I hope crypto entrepreneurs will learn from.

as bad as the situation is for all who got goxed, the coverage it brought (despite all the bashing) in the medium run will bring more people into the fold than it chases out. Silkroad had a huge impact on the popularization of crypto currencies when it was taken down. Plus we'll all learn from our mistakes.

I disagree that it the decaying trend of investigative journalism is merely cost related... in my view media outlets have been transformed into nothing less than propaganda machines by stockholders &amp; vested interests. The job of a modern day editor is to implement the narrative dictated by the corporate office, and journalists simply have to write what their editors want to read instead of what their readers need to know, otherwise they get fired for "crappy" writing.

wrong analogy... silver is still worth something without gold, but if bitoin is gone, all other cryptos will be worthless in the short run.

a crazy person is a tad too harsh dont you think ... i'd say a decent movie script writer ;)
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:50:06
his moniker is appropriate... 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:14:46
exactly ;) a noteworthy marketing stunt by iDrive but you'd be surprised how many ppl still have illusions so I guess its still a valid experiment

where on earth did you see a reference to ASIC in this piece ?! 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:06:36
u right... didnt see it and the didn't get the already submitted notice... strange :?

22% of the market prior to this fiasco... MultiBit wallet is also using Mt.Gox hope they remedy this in their next update :D

ignorant is a kind word for this author...
