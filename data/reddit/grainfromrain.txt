They handle taxes as well as being a 501(c)(3), and were going to be donated coins(I know not how many), so I was asked how to go about it properly(&amp;securely), since being the kid in the family that won't shut up about it, ive got a chance to make dad smile.

@_date: 2014-05-25 20:13:15
You can't compare the 2 like that. That's just stupid. Dogecoin IS better, it's faster so what are you saying? Dogecoin is faster, I don't have to wait 10 mins-several hours for something to clear, why not seconds to a minute? Your argument makes no sense, your not saying how doge will crash or why, your just saying that it will because its in competition with your asset. In real word implementation people won't wait 10 mins for something to confirm like a candy bar, Dogecoin is micro transaction in a bag. 1/10th of a penny for any transaction whereas bit coin is 6cents? So give me insight as to why you believe Dogecoin is not better..the coin itself, in not talking about BiG investors or smart people working on it, I'm talking about dynamics of the coin.

Young shibe, much to learn. Dogecoin is superior, faster transaction times. I can send any transaction and have it complete in under 1 minute for 1/10th of a penny. Bitcoin takes anywhere from a like 10 mins to several hours and cost 6cents. Would you like to wait in line for minutes for something to confirm?

Dogecoin you can sent the same amount of moneys for 1/60th the cost.
So tell me how, when OP is asking about micro-transaction, dogecoin isnt more of a solution? 
if you send $100 via bitcoin your going to pay more in fees then you would in Dogecoin.

Nascar=tv well at least for some. Sochi Olympics. Because of dogecoin, cryptocurreny as a whole has been seen in a better light. Its allowed good talk on tv about cryptocurrencies, not "silkroad,money laundering..etc" those bad connotations that have applied to bitcoin in the minds of people. I dont think bitcoin, quite would be what it is today(user adoption) if it wasnt for other altcoins, as well with dogecoin in the past months its been alive-making mainstream coverage numerous times.

I had, went back and its still locked.. :/
TBH I really like you guys because I like the fact you support other cryptos like LTC &amp; DOGE. Coinbase wont let be buy since the price increase, which is weird as I was able to make many purchases but now they have explanation.
Thanks again, I just want my coin!
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:24:32
learning that, guess thats the price you pay for not dealing 1:1 with people like through localbitcoins or in person. Im just in a remote area and dont have too many options

bro your so going to get down-voted for that ether statement ��

Yea, its considered to be "high" by many that hear the price, but little do they know...they can buy it by the fractions!

It's a mixed emotional roller coaster. We want it to catch-on with the public, just not this soon, with the hopes of having the money in the near future to buy in..yet there are always those who either by chance or calculated decision, nail a bullseye. I seem to be on the opposing side of having the best judgement in perceiving how things might pan out with my life-lemons, I tend to think I make reasonable/sensible/calcu;ated decisions, but life has a way of relentlessly trying to turn me into a bodybuilder with all the resistance it throws at me.  Life:"feel the burn"

You can get a cash refund up to $10 per transaction at Starbucks, actually this is state specific so here in California it is legal

 can actually make money, $2 from $10. So you send bitcoin to the address specified, then scan your barcode at Starbucks and they give you cash refund for the Starbucks gift card that you just scanned

It was better with my experience being able to sell it with fold, but they patched it :-( it was so cool

Sorry for the late response, you can go to Starbucks with a gift card from Starbucks and exchange it for cash. you can only do up to $10 one time per store per day
  -
(Patched)You can also load money onto a gift card at Starbucks and transfer it to the wallet address on the coffee.foldapp.com and they do exchanging for your gift card to bitcoin. Its awesome
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:18:58
Ok that solves my question then

How do they manage to offer 20%off Starbucks gift cards?
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:05:39
Nope, well, i live in SoCal and have called multiple with no success. I have also tried to get them started accepting it, as well as educating them about it, and how they can benefit greatly from using

It's really an awesome thing that Starbucks lets you cash in a gift card at face value
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:41:43
I had posted about this the other day, before they patched it, you were able to buy Bitcoin by loading your foldapp wallet with money that you pay for at Starbucks then refunding it for Bitcoin. It was a nice feature for simply buying bitcoin with a Starbucks gift card
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:12:41
You can also cash out $10 worth of Starbucks gift card That you bought with bitcoin at  any starbucks

Jail breaking just gives you rooter which is blocked by Apple, aka they have root access. I thought there were apps that block the knowledge of apps knowing your device is jailbroken. So since the phone is technically jailbroken from Apple and just on a different user account,  couldn't one make "another account"  that would hide these features?
