Can the Goldcoin blockchain be used to record assignments of gold grams from the Global Collateral Account TVM-LSM-666 to all of humanity?
Global financial accounts show the equivalent of many quadrillions of dollars in gold available interest free to benefit humanity. 
Humanity does not need to depend upon (or be subservient to) potentially corrupt governments, banks, or their cronies, to distribute the gold which is intended to benefit all of humanity. The most poor need it now. 
The gold can be assigned and virtually distributed immediately and securely via crypto-currency.  The gold does not have to move. It should eventually become redeemable to enhance confidence, but this is not an initial requirement.
The Goldcoin blockchain is a secure distributed public ledger which can hold assignment and transfer entries which are publicly verifiable by all, and which can not be corrupted. No banks are needed.
Each countries allocation can be publically declared for all to see and verify. Each countries sub-allocation to local government units, citizens or corporations can be publically declared for all to see. Transparent accountability for every gram is possible and demanded.
Assigned gold grams can be saved or spent by the assignee, and or converted into other currencies on public exchanges. 
There is no shortage of wealth. Such wealth put into the hands of the most needy will instantly relieve poverty, suffering and needless deaths for billions of people worldwide. 
Do any technical details prevent this?
