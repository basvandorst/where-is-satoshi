ITS CLASSED AS A ASSET and tax is paid on   gains...40% for one year investment and about 25% for long term...so govt would want him to sell 300k  of his BTC to pay debt...the problem is he wrote off mining costs that they dont like

no one read the article,The is a editors disclaimer.He did not submit a email as defence in this case...This is a beat up and most of the comments follow form..A sad bunch of disingenous dystopic fucks the lot of you. *Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story somewhat lazily reported that Dr. Edman’s testimony stated that Craig Wright “faked an email,” and not that Wright submitted an email that was, in fact, a fake. A small yet not insignificant semantic difference. The author regrets nothing.* ...Semantics my arse...and I'm sure the author regretted nothing.

you got to understand the australian taxation office...Having 1.1 million bitcoin gives them access to capital gains even if they are converted to fiat or not.  So pretend to be satoshi to avoid tax...If you had 1.1 million btc and the ATO knew then they would require you to pay them 40% of your holdings.
Do you understand that...not 40% of your profit but instead the australian tax office requires you to sell the btc to pay the tax....would you stand there and cop that...the commisioner of the ATO has resigned since then and both the ATO and feds would have flew in for a healthy cut.
