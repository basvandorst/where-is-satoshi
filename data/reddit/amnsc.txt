What's about Lumino ?
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:51:08
What token is it using? What's the "IoV"?
RSK is using the sBTC token for his main chain and another one for all the other services.

Lol the downvotes... Someone wants to bet about it?

it looks like a discussion coming from south park..

You are right. But in that case the chances that this amendment get accepted are quite high.
It's not an amendment submitted by a random politic, it has been submitted by the gouvernement itself. And it's part of a way bigger plan, a revision law about social and jobs.
It's definitely fitting better to the right-wing party than to the "socialist party" elected. So the chances than it's not getting accepted are quite low. (knowing than they voted one month ago the Renseignement Law, which is just allowing them to make a mass surveillance..)

are there any subtitles available?

Yes, it's scary to think than as soon as you lose your job, a random guy (bc yes, people from pole emploi are really random people, without any proper qualification) can have legally access to your privacy, without asking or reporting to any authority.

2MB + Segwit HF.
What Bitcoin needs right now is to win time. To not lose the momentum and the network effect. The ecosystem doesn't need the fee market yet and this fee market is creating an awful user experience and limiting the Bitcoin's apps and businesses.
2MB right now avoids that and give us time to develop good layer 2 solutions for payment system and more elegant scaling plans. Meanwhile, people should stop being psychorigide: long term 1 or 2mb is not changing anything, but short term it changes everything.
Then I guess Bitcoin should hardfork to show it can still do it, the ecosystem is still young and reactive.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:44:42
Not exactly. And even better if we can have 4mb now increasing only the block to 2mb. We get more time to improve the tech without sacrificing the UX. Where is the pb? Why is so difficult to compromise about the 2mb blocks? Better to compromise Bitcoin itself? 0o
The ecosystem is not able to decide a direction, it seems compromising is the only way to move on. Unless you prefer status quo.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:59:03
Split the network? If there is consensus on the fork, the old chain will just die.
Are you saying Bitcoin will not be able to hardfork anymore bc of the network split? 0o
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:22:03
More than 2mb? This is new to me. Any link to a demonstration?
If Segwit is so perfect, why the fork is not done already? People in front are stupid? They want to damage Bitcoin on purpose and to fuck their investment?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:19:21
In resume, a battle of ego. They dont care of Bitcoin's health and development, their reputation first.
I understand perfectionism, and I'm fine with that. But perfection is enemy of good and, right now, it's damaging Bitcoin. Compromise and win time to find the perfect and elegant solution.
This small compromise will not damage Bitcoin long term.

"miners keep pushing": its not only miners, its a part of the community. Question is, why are they pushing?
The purpose of the 2mb + Segwit hf is to find a compromise with which everyone agrees. In that case its not a contentious hf.

Paper wallet has some inconvenient. If you store it in a unique place, what happen if that place burnt down? If you make copies, it increases the risk of being physically robbed... Increases the chances to "lost" the paper wallet...
So I dont consider the paper wallet option as the "ultimate cold storage".
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:53:23
I'm making my life complicated... Looking for the "ultimate" storage... You can store them easily, safely, in a lot of different ways. Dont be afraid ; )
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:50:17
It's for a long term cold storage... To remind a passphrase you set years ago and never used since... quite dangerous, with myself at least ^^
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:58:02
Winning time to not lose the momentum and network effect probably deserves this concession, even if its not the absolut and most elegant solution.

Same here. Bought my first one at the all time high price, and buying since. Completed my 21 collection in september when it was around 200. Now I am buying when I want to use them, purse, fivver, with friends, ...
Really cool and fascinating adventure and times.
