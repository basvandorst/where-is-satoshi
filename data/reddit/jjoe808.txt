Interesting...  I always though bears were famous for hibernating and bulls started with the same letter.

They are investing for the short term, wall street needs to wake up.  Look at the big autofirms they only cared about profit for years, profit should be part of a stock price, but they should have been using that money to solve the obvious problems in the auto industry.  Meanwhile they were intentionally nerfing thier electric cars to sell you antiquated oil tech.  Their cars are trash tier when compared to tesla's: Lexus and BMW included (I've had both).  It is no longer acceptable to be just a car company you have to also be a tech company.  It's 2018 and these companies don't put touch screens in even their high tier models they are still reliant on ackward "scrolly" input devices and low quality voice command. Investors need to focus less on profit and more on innovation and disruption.

Touchscreen?  Interesting.  My 2016 4 series has that junk dial mouse and some 80's nightrider shit for a monitor on the dash.  The voice command is pretty bad I use my phone(instead of the one i paid 4k for and only has 1 purpose).  I do think many car companies are waking up and being a bit more forward thinking, but without tesla they wouldn't have had to.

Yup I have some snapchat stock and it literally blew up yesterday.  I told my millennial crypto investment club the response was "meh, looks like a small altcoin rally".  It's very likely crypto will be around after most of these companies no longer exist.  Its not tied to the success or existance of any one country so that also a + over hodling fiat(which I'm also doing given how over priced all these stocks are).  Wall street hates it because the can't stand to see you people look at what they are doing and be like "lol u only had 200% return last year??"  The young can afford to make some risky investments.  I don't think it's a bad thing.
