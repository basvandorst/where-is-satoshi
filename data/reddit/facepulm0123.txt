yes, why only the age - what about gender? This is very very important here.

Yeah but openbazaar is somehow still not even close to be finished.

I need numbers, how many users and how much btc are gone?

Same here, some weeks ago when Bitcoin was like 220$ I tried to buy but Circle, Kraken and others require that I send them a  BUNCH of information. Than it takes day to validate. Cirle as example did not even work, but they were not able to tell me that at the beginning, it came out after I tried to send my ID like 10 times. Kraken on th other hand was the worst, they told me I need to send my passport, photos of myself and also residence ID´s and so on - the support was just sending copy/paste mails, absolutely no help from nowhere. Terrible, really.
AFTER you made it, it takes again 3-4 days defore you can send money from your bank to your account so you can buy bitcoin. Coinbase did work at the end, everything else not BUT it toke again a looot of time. The not funny thing is that bitcoin went in the time like ~280$ , now I have to buy it for a lot of more money.
I cannot imagine that normal people will ever use bitcoin if it is how it is right now. It´s a shame.

The NSA will be the first who will use QC´s - and then we can say bye bye to bitcoin (and also to the internet!)

In a police state like the US I can imagine that. But in Canada?...

yes you are right, these are very relevant BITCOIN news. Post more of them here.

Where did you write down your mnemonic?
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:45:40
Agree with that statement about Interpol, but another side you do not need any executable file to spread malware. Ask the NSA, they are doin it without these things.

I like this picture! Have to send them to some of my "non-it friends" who thinks bitcoin can be 'hacked'
Any more? ;)
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:30:17
Well, then wait for the mail and make clear you have your mnemonic - that is maybe the most important thing for greenaddress.
I think these things will take some time, the support cannot just reset your wallet in one day.

I'm not good with compiling and configurations. A ready website with login for beta is what the most people need - we are not all coders and hackers.
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:01:44


xD I do this every day! It´s really exhausting, I know I should just let go ...but somehow I cannot.

Too bad that Badoo is a really bad service. For men you get 80% fake money grabbing accounts.

Hi jespow, thank you I will try Kraken for sure once again if I think it´s time to trade some bitcoin. I see the website got a new look.
My problem with kraken was that even for 1$ trade, they told me I need tier 3 validation (a lot of documents...). I'm from germany - maybe that´s a problem for Kraken, I hope germany and kranken will work easily one day.

Let´s move to Agora and do the same thing!

stop upvoting bullshit news.

Cheap - maybe somebody from india can help.

Other tip: you should always use for every single service another passphrase. Because if one got hacked they have access to every other services also.
The problem then: if you have lik 20 or more services... well then things are getting harder. But for that there are other solutions, this simple passpharsing as explained in the link is not the best as you can understand.
