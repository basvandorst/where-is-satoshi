Some things that jumped out at me right away. Fibonacci seems to be expressed again. 
1. Vines, or their leaves, like other plants, likely grow in Fibonacci sequence/growth pattern.
2. The corner art "G" swirls are potentially Fibonacci references as well.
3. The vines (Fibonacci) appear to wrap around and break into the (broken?) strategy (7x9 chessboard). Also the general notion implied by Fibonacci entanglement.
4. I'm not quite sure about the significance of the bird imagery, perhaps it is referencing the bird opening.
5. The maypole seems to figure into how the game is ended or falls apart (depends on your disposition).
6. The "magic eightball" (all-seeing eye) on the base of the queen.
7. There is some possible stress or relationship between the bordering leaf or flame like flicks and the melting queen / burning chess board .
8. There is also some potential implication of diagonal symmetry if you fold the Fibonacci G swirls corner to corner?

9. Border background motif can be thought to look like high grass (palette correlation with vine leaves and corner swirls) behind a fire. 9.a. This whole motif also considered as audio or otherwise peak counting with background "noise". 10. There is a small F and maybe another letter c or o or maybe even a 9 or a or q in the dove wing. The mysterious second letter also seems to be perhaps sitting atop an all-seeing eye pyramid. 11. Is this a pi symbol at 3rd square up from bottom left?
