Best bet would probably be a miner LiveCD or thumbdrive of some kind that you could just boot on the target machine. 
If you're hoping to just pop some software on a machine, you already can, you'll just be limited to CPU mining without proper video drivers.

There are a number of CPU miners available for various platforms.
Maybe give [this one]( a try.

I like this idea.

They're basically reconfigurable processors which can optimized for specific functions.

I actually like to naysay bitcoin but, you're missing a lot.
* Selling the 130 or so of BTC he makes each day isn't going to have a significant effect on the market.
* People are still buying hardware even though all indications say that mining will cease to be profitable soon. There's a good chance he could unload those boxes to other miners for at or near cost.
* If the whole mining market dries up he can always sell the machines to gamers. List them for half cost and they'd sell off in a few days.

5830s can be found in stock for $110-$150. Good luck find a 5870 **in stock** for $140, $180 or even $250. It's closer to $300 (or more) if you want to buy one without any hassle.
Of course, you'll probably be able to take your pick from dozens of cheap used listings in a few weeks after the mining difficulty has ramped two or three more times and people start giving up in droves.

What I find really impressive is the fact this adds up to a fraction of the hashrate some single users are currently pushing.

Gonna be a hard bounty to get filled I imagine. Though, it might be high enough that someone else will undercut it.
Personally, I'd like to see a pool operating suite go open source and someone create a bounty pool where people could contribute cycles to a bounty rather than coin directly. Everyone interested in contributing to a bounty could point to the pool with 50%+ of any found blocks being used to fill the bounty pot.

Well, it's hardly free, particularly in the case of a purpose-built array like this but, I certainly understand the fascination with seemingly creating money out of thin air.

Do you intend to release your code to the world? 
I know that's a tall order in an arena as competitive and potentially profitable at bitcoin mining.

I lucked up and mined a block within a few hours of starting up solo last week. I probably would have quit by now had that not happened.
What's really astounding to me is the thought of the folks who picked up on the project in its infancy and may be sitting on thousands of coins.

Sell/trade the 460s for a pair of 5830s. That will put you at 500Mhash.

In that case, spending money to build a PC for mining bitcoin is a pretty horrible idea.
