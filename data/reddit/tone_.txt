The app looks great, even if it's not really something that I feel I need right now.
I have been looking for a great app that has clear, re-sizeable widgets that track prices so I can very quickly see information without going into an app.
Not to diminish the great looking app you've built here, just maybe an idea for the future!

I still can't trust Bitcoins I'm afraid. I'm going to stick with mining Doge on NiceHash.

Can someone give a half decent rundown of how Steam BTC payment worked? Why fees was a big issue and why there was a need to correct payment amounts and update? $20 fee's etc?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:02:20
Noobs aren't spending their coin anyway so tbf who gives a fuck. The premise that it's important for Coinbase to switch is surely just wrong.

Under a million? You evidently don't know **how** to run a business then! All good businesses *start* at a million in revenue, **everyone** knows that!

A bubble bursting is the wrong metaphor. You're referring to when it will increase and when it will stabilise. It's not like it will reach 100 or even 40k and then drop down to 5. It will just top increasing.

How does increasing block size and pricing out 50% of miners promote decentralisation?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:09:41
Everyone talks about selling, but in reality they are all in the same boat. We just need to work towards improving the usability of Bitcoin in everyday situations.  Everyone's going to come around to the idea of "oh I can just spend my Bitcoin directly" eventually.

Most of the people saying this do not know the answer to the question but it looks smart to say it because they saw someone else look smart and say it some time.

I've seen this post in so many subreddits so many times.
AS other shave pointed out, there obviously are very informative posts, very often. But there are also a lot of memes and jokes that come in and pass out very quickly. That is normal for a growing sub with a lot of new and excitable new users.
People who post things like this just end up looking like they are trying way too hard to appear smart. The shorter answer to your question is **one of the hundreds of other Bitcoin information site and not a community driven aggregation site**. People post stories from those sites to here. If the sub isn't as you'd like it, change it. Don't sit there and bitch-cry about how other people aren't spending *their* time bettering the platform you use to for leisure, for free.
This is true for every single sub.

Well as a whole, individually the cost of mining dwarfs blocksize fees. And the network becomes decentralised and pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:45:08
But bigger block sizes literally does the opposite and results in less miners because they can't compete.

One of them was me.
Makes me kind of sad to see "one of them was my dad" and "one of them was my grandpa", but better late than never?
Going to be adding to it over the next few months and hopefully in a few months time I'll have a whole Bitcoin.

Thanks! Had been looking at  - which only seems to show USD on MtGox.

Lol he's getting really angry all over I think he put all his pocket money into some altcoin and is now really bitter. It's quite funny.

Well that's largely opinion. Starcraft 2 *is* a less team orientated sport, though personally I find things like Proleague with teams picking different players for maps and matchups to be a great implementation of team mechanics.
LoL and Dota will never be able to generate the personal heroes and individual stories akin to that of Starcraft 2 :) If we're comparing moba's to football, then why have you picked the common team factor that means mobas will succeed? It seems you've picked an arbitrary similarity and declared *that* the reason that LoL/Dota are superior? Maybe it's some of the many other differences / similarities that will define success here?
Also the team aspect of mobas is overrated. When you're watching two Starcraft 2 players controlling vast armies across a large map, harrassing and attacking at different places, engaging in specific ways with arrangements of different units with different abilities, the scale and depth quickly exceeds that of a few players frantically communicating in a moba battle, imo.
Lastly, I think it's quite apparent that from a return standpoint Starcraft is the best choice. This, like the previous TB event has the largest impact within the community, and is not just another small event lost in a sea of tournaments and streams. The *actual* impact is far greater here I believe.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:34:59
Definitely the best option. Whilst there was a bit of a downturn whilst other games such as Dota 2 exited their beta period, SC2 has recently been on the up and up. In players, new teams and new tournaments.
SC2 has the most room for growth, and still even has an official game release (Legacy of the Void) to come, which brings a multiplayer update as well as a host of new Battle.net features.
In all honesty, with Dota 2 I think you'd just get lost amongst what is already there. SC2, imo, has the perfect balance at the moment of exposure and room for growth.

I've been using Coinbase for a while. Bought a little at about $4k I think and forgot about it. People do give good, correct advice about starting out with Coinbase, but what are the next steps really?
How do you get started with a better wallet? Where can you find people to talk through and buy without going through an exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:58:39


True, but the only reason that is possible is *because* of the initial tech. You could definitely argue that continued growth is not down to the tech, as looking purely at tech usefulness, you'd obviously go for something like Etherium.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:33:56
The real question is, who's going to step up and make a similar statement about the price during 2018. Lowest prediction wins (so saying $100,000,000,000 won't count)!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:54
Very good and important points. People also do explain using wallets well, but how are people buying Bitcoin without using an exchange? Or is it get in, use the exchange, get it out?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:54:14
Don't overthink it now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:03:38
In 2020 you'll *spend* your Bitcoin, not sell it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:18:36
People could really use maybe 3 sentences with what to do in this situation, with some high level specifics. Is there a sidebar link or something? I went through all this moving it from Coinbase and read about 20 articles and threads before doing so.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:29:53
Yes, again the people poking this out of nowhere are doing it unnecessarily. But then in any further discussion, anyone not spouting pc chants is bombed into the ground.
I'm not saying every time it's acceptable, but in a time like this, on it might come up legitimately. And people focus on Scarlett and not Naniwa because there is something to talk about with Scarlett. It's surely you in this situation that are making it into some huge and negative deal. Scarlett and Naniwa are not 100% the same. Scarlett has more to talk about (not that it's necessary to all the time), it's not automatically a huge negative.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:10:57
You still are trying to poke holes, and now you're just bailing as it's gone poorly. How does talking about something automatically mean negatives? Some real logic right there...
It's nothing to do with the thread, well done, welcome to an off topic conversation. They are actually allowed.
I said numerous times the initial comment was not necessary, and was speaking more to peoples replies to anyone who discusses this openly instead of blind denial of anything. Yes we are *very mildly* off topic, but that is actually allowed funnily enough.
You have no reply to my actual point, so keep dodging it and arguing against something that is not the issue, nor an issue at all. So back out with some dignity.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:06:17
When other people who are basing what they say on fact are shot down and labelled, tact doesn't seem so great.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:45:12
Perhaps not. Doesn't mean that anyone who does mention it in a non offensive way deserves to be attacked because they refuse to do the whole pretend like there's nothing to discuss thing. I know it's not something that needs to be discussed every day, why do people keep replying to me with this like it's something I'm arguing against. I'm saying anyone who does say "ah I think Scarlett is someone who converted genders" or however the hell you want to put it shouldn't be mobbed and attacked as they are, as.. what they hell did they do? This thread is a prime example of where it *might* come up.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:08:58
I didn't say they did. I was addressing times when people ask, or the people who reply to people asking. I said numerous times I was talking about people getting attacked for merely acknowledging it. I even said it was not necessary or mature.
You seem to have no actual reply to my points and are going to attempt instead poke holes in the fact that someone *argued against* you, instead of the *content of their argument*.
If nothing else I was just expressing thoughts and ideas in a neutral environment.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:20:14
Potentially and probably correct. But I wanted to address more the mass downvotes that and anyone like him receives. You can't even have a discussion where you attempt to present some thoughts or ideas, maybe ask some questions. I'm getting massively downvoted and all I did was basically suggest not being so harsh on people that maybe don't subscribe to your way of thinking / don' yet subscribe.
But because I'm not yelling out generic politically correct comments, I'm getting downvoted. Why? Have I said anything offensive? Have I suggested we take away peoples rights or not allow them to speak?
I'm not even arguing against the people mindlessly writing in pc statements to get precious upvotes. I'm just saying don't instantly attack those who aren't. Ironically becoming someone in that situation myself, in the process.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:06:38
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it just doesn't add up.
If it's not a huge deal, why even question it. and are clearly just pointing out the obvious difference in Scarlett's case and history. It's not necessarily awful or taboo, it's just a fact. Saying it to a person may be considered rude, if they are insecure about it, but on Reddit, hardly.
Furthermore, although in modern society it may be acceptable to call yourself whatever you like, as we pointlessly change the meaning of words to become watered down changeable versions of what they were, but words still maintain original meaning for some, which is fine.
Wikipedia says:


So it's fine to call yourself a guy or a girl if you want to, but it's also fine for someone to use these words to define someone in the other, original way. Else we're basically just pretending words don't exist.
What if we kept male and female for whatever you decided you were, and invented zaa and zbb, zaa meaning genetically, physically male, and zbb meaning genetically, physically female. These are only relating to physical traits and have nothing to do with however you wish to align yourself. Eventually people would say "I can be zbb or zaa if I want to." Which is pointless, because it's just a definition with scientific boundaries.
I hope that made some sense and went some way towards presenting my viewpoint when it comes to people getting downvoted unless they blindly pretend and act like someone is the gender that they assign themselves. We all know the history, yet unless we pretend we're completely oblivious, we must be hateful selfish individuals.
I'm not saying pointing it out is necessary or mature, but the common response isn't much better as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:00:34
Because discussing something that's not sunshine and roses is ofcourse harmful. Logic wins again right there.
You are continuing to try and poke holes, and then bail when you fail. As I've said, the initial point was not necessary, and I was talking about peoples attitutes towards users like /u/upropse
