They got 2 cease and desist letters from State SEC regulators. They returned everyone's locked up loans in the form of BCC tokens which you can send out of the site to exchange, they also allowed you to send any BTC funds to an external wallet. They didnt steal anyone's money but they give them a token that isnt worth very much at the moment.

that 50 BTC didnt have value until old boy bought the pizzas with BTC and thus gave Bitcoin a value. If Bitcoin never got an initial value, Bitcoin wouldnt have value. Think of that first Pizza buy for 10,000 BTC as Bitcoin's ICO :D
Value is a delusional subjective consensus. At first 10,000 BTC = 2 pizza. Now 10,000 BTC = 2 Jets. The world of value is imaginary and it's not just Bitcoin.

Most people arent too lazy to send 'walking around money' to a LN enabled wallet as opposed to walking around with their main wallet worth 6 figures in many cases. If BTC = store of value, then BTC+LN = Cash/coins. Simply not holding all of your funds in a single wallet on your person is an improvement in the security model over the current paradigm.

The Bitcoin network changes the difficult of the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm in so that a 'block' is found every 10 minutes. The more hashing power the network has, the faster blocks are found, the higher the difficulty. This will continue until about the year 2140 with the reward being cut by half every 4 or so years. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:28:06
This. More than likely they'll just not make a decision to save face in which case it goes ahead and to the moons of jupiter! :D
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:37:04
Yes it's very rare to win so most people mine as a part of a pool where the reward is distributed according to how much computer power you contribute to the pool. Cant really say how much it's gonna go up, but I can say that I'm a long term holder. You have to look at what the potential market cap could be. $100 Billion isnt unreasonable , we're at $20 Billion now, so a 5x increase in the next few years doesnt seem crazy. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:09:23
Yeah I support Segwit too but this was very uninformative and annoying. Did the community really request this? :/
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:27:49
12.5 BTC is the current block reward distributed every 10 minutes to either a solo miner or a mining pool. It's not worth investing into mining as you're better off buying Bitcoin and simply hodling it.

I hate to break it to you, but unless you're running a full node on the device you're using to transfer BTC, Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash are ever going to actually be 'Peer-to-Peer'... Having to access an external node is by it's explicit nature, using a 3rd party (but don't tell Satoshi that!!!) Just sayin ;)
The whitepaper also says "... routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. " - escrow by it's nature employes a 3rd party... sounds like he's describing something like LN to me... 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:55:59
That would count as your node and your wallet would be considered the same 'party' and not a '3rd party'.

I had my coins stored in Breadwallet and only had a 12 word seed so had to figure out how to convert that to private keys, import into EletrumCash and even with the highest fee possible I'll be lucky for it to confirm while the price is still up :(

I just did this update on my RX480 windows 10 64-bit rig. Doesnt seem to make hashing speeds any faster just assuming its optimized for power consumption and lifespan. Either way we out here! 
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:49:12
Absolutely. Cold storage without a middleman would be optimal. Like buying the bitcoin coins directly from an exchange and taping the private key to the back of a silver dollar ;)
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:24:27
No prob, I used the tool that Bicointalk thread (below) tells you to use, make sure you download the .html file and not entering your seed into the web-based dialogue (for security). Follow the directions on the thread and it should spit out a bunch of private keys (bottom to the right), import those into Electrum Cash wallet and your balance should show up. I wasnt quite sure whichs keys to import so just started doing them all and eventually my full balanced showed up in BCC. 
The tool:

My transaction to Yobit wound up going through in a little under 4 hours, depending on the transaction fee you used there's a good chance you'll get confirmed in the next block :)

@_date: 2017-01-03 14:49:32
I can see that you know your shit but the reality is that those collectable coins are probably one of the most secure ways for someone to cold store Bitcoin. I do get your point about the person who made the coin ultimately having the private key and 'if you dont own the keys you dont own the bitcoin'. But saying 'thats not bitcoin' is like me showing you my private wallet ID and keys written on a piece of paper and you saying 'thats not a Bitcoin wallet', when it very well would be a wallet in cold storage. I do respect your dedication to the inner workings of blockchain, so not really trying to start a pissing contest with you ;)
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:16:44
I paid a 0.02 BCC fee to send 3.2 coins, this shit better confirm in the next block lol 
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:51:46
I got in the last block, thank god. If you watch the exchanges the price drops everytime a block gets found

Wont replace fiat, but will likely be accepted at the majority of places like Visa, Mastecard, Amex, etc. So the idea is not to get rid of your inherent native digital value before it's fully matured :)

Interest on a $100k mortgage at 5% over 20 years is $100k... not $900k. You're also putting equity into the home in the form of your principal payments. It all depends on the cost to own vs. rent in the area you live (it's not a blanket case). But actual reality/numbers seems to have been lost in your discussion.

Nodes set the consensus rules and miners enforce the rules (basically). Although miners are technically nodes, not all nodes are miners. Running a node is more 'volunteering' to support the network and doesnt really require specialized hardware, as where mining transactions for profit requires an ASIC but the incentive is free Bitcoin. 
What they're trying to do on August 1st is have a majority of the nodes signaling the activation of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol which will allow 3rd party layers to process Bitcoin transactions off-chain, ideally lowering transaction fees and making Bitcoin a realistically usable currency, as opposed to a simply store of value.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:59:23
Setting up a node isnt the same as mining, but if you have 150GB of space free on any PC, I'd say setup a node an singal BIP148 asap :D
