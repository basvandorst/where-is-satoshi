An "ℒ-like anonymous remote talk" would be awesome, but I'm looking forward for a talk by as a probably very good plan b. This contains radical changes like one of the sections in scaling bitcoin hong kong ( I think), but it's never too early to start thinking about radical solutions to scalability.
I have to read the thing again slowly (ie completely) because I don't think I get it yet (ie I still have hope that we can keep scripts, I really must be missing something...).

Mhmm, maybe not if some early adopters (say, Satoshi) are among those people. Even if you are right about number of people, you can't say anything about amount of coins, can you?
Better just not risk when everybody seems to agree with the 2mb hardfork (just not on 75% or 28 days), I think.

Never "upgrade" your full node to a consensus ruleset that doesn't enforce those values.
@_date: 2016-04-13 10:14:11
If the goal is to end up with 2 chains and currencies, instead of a controversial hardfork, why not just an altcoin (or a so called "spin-off")?
People calling "Bitcoin" to 2 different chains and currencies may cause many communication problems that would increase the costs of commerce (and good money is supposed to reduce the costs of trade, not increase it).

Difficulty adjustments happen every "two weeks" (in absolute time, that is, bitcoin's median time, not that relativistic UTC thing), so the more hashing power competing the more costly it is to "mine" a BTC unit.
Why should we expect hashing power competition to increase when the BTC price rises?
Because if it suddenly becomes more profitable to mine due to price volatility, more people will step in to mine (maybe even with "outdated hardware" that is less efficient in turning energy into hashes).
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:56:25


It's not miners with slow connections who have the problem. It's the miners that are not well connected to the hashing majority. If the hashing majority is well connected but badly connected to the rest of the world (like it currently happens in china), it's not the hashing majority that's going to be hurt for being badly connected to the rest of the world, it's the miners in the rest of the world who are going to suffer it in reduced profits (maybe enough to turn them into losses and getting out of business).
EDIT: good question, though.
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:45:34


Yes, the attacker can defraud you with an apparently most-work chain that is invalid because it contains a block bigger than 1 MB (but you will now accept that chain). So you could accept a payment as valid that has never hit the most-work valid chain.
@_date: 2015-06-09 10:27:04
That's like saying "if 1 MB blocks work, 1 GB work too".
There's an inherent tradeoff between miner-validated transaction volume and centralization.
Sidechains don't change that.
@_date: 2015-06-27 01:03:46
If the goal is to maintain 2 incompatible chains (and currencies), why not just announce the more centralized version (the one with the bigger blocks) of it as an altcoin?
Compared to other altcoins the main difference is that some part of the miner's subsidy is directly distributed to current bitcoin holders instead.
But maintaining 2 incompatible chains that both claim to be bitcoin just doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:28:54
But that would mean some users would follow the wrong chain for some time and risk being defrauded. This deployment mechanism is extremely risky.
I'm trying to classify consensus forks and clarify their risks in a BIP:

Yes the goal is deploying an uncontroversial hardfork, in a way that doesn't stop other uncontroversial soft/hardforks from being deployed.


Yes, that's why I'm proposing giving a lot of time for universal deployment (I believe I used 5 years as an example).
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:10:09


I agree with this point of view. But there's other changes that are completely uncontroversial while still being simple enough. You may be interested in my BIP draft: 
It is hard to define "uncontroversial", but seems obvious to me that the current blocksize hardfork proposals are NOT uncontroversial (for all sane definitions of it). If reviewers weren't distracted with the blocksize debate I think we could merge my proposal into bitcoin core in a week, let's say a month to be conservative.
Let's do a hardfork!
Just please an uncontroversial one with plenty of time for all software to adapt to it.
Let's safely change the consensus rules without actually forking the chain!
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:00:58
I haven't argued against increasing OP_RETURN space.
I've just explained that many applications that don't need proof of publication shouldn't be using the blockchain as transport layer. As said there, I don't think proof of publication is a sound technical solution, but that's another topic.
What I think is that the standard policy shouldn't be as important as it is right now.
To solve that, we should encapsulate all policy decisions so that is easier for miners and full nodes to create their own policies. That's the motivation behind  and 
My main interest is replace-by-fee policy (which petertodd also supports), but the code refactors should serve for OP_RETURN sizes as well.
I believe it will be benefitial to have diversity of policies instead of continuosly debating "the best standard policy" (which is something that is unavoidably subjective). Instead of "fixing" the standard policy, let's just make it less important.
That should reduce the number of dicussions of this type, which in my opinion aren't very productive.
@_date: 2014-10-16 06:28:00
Thank you for the kind words, but no, I've never worked for Bitnation.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:13:59
Well the main motivations for refactorings is imrpoving the quality of Bitcoin core code itself. The code still needs A LOT of these changes. That will make it easier for more people to undesrtand and contribute to the code.
Some of the changes will ALSO help altcoins in the long run. Like the CAmount type will help Freicoin become more easily maintainable in the long run.
In the short term changes obviously make things harder for freicoin just like they make  rebasing harder to viacoin.
Please stop putting words in my mouth. I could just as well say that the only reason you don't like changes in bitcoin is because they make your work on viacoin harder.
But me saying that won't make it true (I hope it's not), just like you saying "the motivation for all jtimon's PRs is help altchains" doesn't make it true (I believe that's rather obvious in some of my commits, btw). Specifically this change is motivated libconsensus work, which everybody seems to agree it's a great idea for several reasons.
We have discussed several times in github that helping altchain projects is not a very relevant reason to change bitcoin's code. Higher quality software is.
By no means we should leave the code untouched and mixed up as it is right now to assist altchain's maintainability.
Bitcoin's code has many many things to improve. Consensus code must be encapsulated. Not all changes to consensus code are risky.

Not really.


Segwit as a SF already gives you a greater size increase.
More importantly, SW as a HF would be much more slower to activate, perhaps the bip9 initial date would have been 15 nov 2017 instead of 15 nov 2017 (one more year to give everyone time to adapt before the earliest possible activation).


Segwit doesn't impede future hardforks.

Right, if my neighbor steals onions from my vegetable garden, I wouldn't consider "If you steal from my garden I will build a wall around my garden to prevent you from doing it" as a thread. Even if he never stole from me. But it may be just me that doesn't consider defenses to attacks as threads.


Are you sure it was to present day scenarios and not potential attacks but miners? It would just surprise me. Do you have a link?
I guess you're not saying this because you heard someone heard luke saying this threads...

That way you trust several 3rd parties, which I guess reduces the chances of being lied to, but also makes privacy much worse. I guess Tor helps.

It seems they had many uncontroversial hfs and 1 controversial hf that resulted in 2 chains. Whoever wants to do a controversial hf and doesn't care about producing 2 chains can do so at any moment, they don't even need a hashrate majority or listen to any devs, and nobody can stop them.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:07:22
Then I would say it is unlikely to be a miner paying to himself (for the other way of doing it is much more efficient, without the risk of paying the fees).
Maybe it was just someone rich that didn't care to overpay fees to be really sure he would enter the next block, who knows.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:00:29
You are free to use other software. But that doesn't give you the power to force other users to run software they don't want. You want devs to release controversial consensus changes because you believe that can force the change you want, but that's not how the system works. It is users who decide, you can't force other users to "fire the devs" if they don't want to.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:16:59
Each user the chain with the rules they want, maybe both.
After the fork, the hashrate will likely be divided proportionally to each chain's reward and independently of previous signalization anyway.
I will definitely keep using the chain that maintains the rules I want unless of course I am alone in that chain.

I don't think there was any release, to be honest I'm not certain on what their concrete promises were and I don't care much either.


So what? Validation is done by (full node) users.


Not an agreement among all users. They can agree to whatever there, users can still do whatever they want.


I'm starting to get tired of your assumptions about me and your insults, honestly.


I did not make any agreement and none in that meeting has the authority to talk for all users.


It is, can we talk about your and my position instead of other people's? Can you stop assuming you know what I think because you have heard other people?


Core is not a person and doesn't believe anything. Nobody went to that meeting representing Bitcoin Core.


I didn't even go to that meeting or have anything to do with it, why should I?


I heard some miners already failed on their end right after the meeting, but it seems the devs didn't matter and are still committed to do their part. 


I got many answers, but they usually answer to something else. I ask "what to remove?" they ususally say things like "do it as a hf!" "add more size!" "do a hf afterwards!" these are not consensus rule changes in segwit and thus they are not something you can remove from segwit to make them happy.

And what would they do that instead of making money by mining?

I think it is well defined. But I agree it is a group too big to consult everyone and thus know a priori if a hardfork will be controversial or not.

I expect nothing from those meetings because I don't attend. But if people meet and talk, good for them.
Afaik the devs are honoring their promises even though some miners didn't honor the agreement.
But nothing that comes out of these meetings can be imposed to users if they don't want to.


If changes to the consensus rules are controversial I prefer that they are not deployed, yes, including increasing the size limit. But if people want to do controversial forks, they can do them whenever they want (they don't need the hashrate majority like BU requires).
I'm mostly interested on finding out what is controversial about segwit, since I assumed everybody would like it. What to remove from segwit to make it less controversial.
Maybe segwit can be deployed without the move from size to weight (what gives the size increase, but some users complain about that part).
 
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:55:36

I believe those were "current usage patterns" months ago.

It is true that those 3.7 MB are using a lot of multisig on purpose for testing, but I hope multisig usage keeps growing anyway.

If some users want to do a controversial hf, nobody can stop them. They don't even need a hashrate majority to activate.
The BU devs think that if they get the majority of the hashrate, users will feel forced to follow, but fortunately that's not how the system works.
Also they can keep asking for more and more size. At some point 2 mb was enough, now segwit offers more than that and it's somehow "too little, too late" for some.
Also the fact that is core that proposes the hf doesn't magically make it uncontroversial, some users could refuse it and you would still get too chains/currencies.
Patience and find out changes that are acceptable to all users.

Miners can certainly do that, and if there are users willing to use that chain/currency instead of the one with the old rules, it may make sense for them to do it.


No, assuming segwit is uncontroversial, 95% is fine and it's more secure than lower thresholds. If it is controversial, I think it's better that it doesn't get activated.

@_date: 2016-01-03 18:04:53


Depends on how much, of course. If we were to raise capacity to say, 1 Million tx/s then the mining centralization pressure would come directly from the CPU needs, not propagation times. As I tried to explain in 
But yes, at this scale propagation times are the main source of mining centralization concerns (and in my opinion, the maximum block size consensus rule is more about limiting mining centralization than about DDOS attacks like some other people claim).


I don't know that idea, sorry.


I think both weak blocks and IBLT have great potential to solve these scale vs mining centralization issues, yes.


I oppose BIP101 for many reasons. Probably the most important being that it is a Schism hardfork and doesn't follow BIP99's recommendation for schism hardforks (which btw, I have to correct to use the sign bit in the block.nVersion so that even SPV nodes notice the hardfork).
But, yeah "this is not a concern because we're working on solving it" isn't very convincing to me.  Would you recommend using smart contracts that can be gamed with malleability because "segregated witnesses can solve that"? I certainly wouldn't. First deploy the malleability fix, only then use the smart contracts that are unsafe with malleability. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:36:41
By removing a consensus rule on the size and putting it in the hands of miners it is inherently controversial and thus will likely result in 2 chains/currencies if their hardfork is activated and maintains a majority of the hahsrate.

Obviously by "market price" I meant the same price Peter is talking about: tx fees. Not Bitcoin's price in USD or any other national currency.
If it is true that "the market price[...] is moving to the left of Q*", then there wouldn't be any free transaction in blocks, because whatever that market price is, it must be higher than 0 satoshis.

@_date: 2017-02-07 17:26:16




I said proportional to the reward. Let's say chain B starts with 95% of the hashrate, but after some trading price changes, maybe chain A gets more fees...If the reward of chan A is 2 times the reward of chain B, I expect chain A to get 66% of the hashrate (even if it had 5% for some time) and chain B to get 33% (even if it had 95% for some time), for that's the economically rational thing to do for miners. 


No, you could do a hf removing the size limit without the hashrate majority.
You just need some hashrate and users willing to use the chain with the new rules.
BU has chosen to require a hashrate majority because they believe all users will follow the majority of the hashrate, even if it doesn't validate rules they care about.
I guess they also believe the attempt to remove the 21 M cap on the first halvening failed, not because all users ignored that hf, but because the hashrate majority didn't follow the hf. But I believe the removal of the havenings would have failed even if 95% of the hashrate had initially gone with the hf chain.
What do you believe? Would you update to a hf that removes the 21 M cap or creates 1 M new btc per block just because miners decide that's what's best for the system?
I know I wouldn't.
  
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:49:46


I doubt made such a thread. I think it's more likely that he was misunderstood or taken out of context. For example, imagining potential scenarios if you say "what if miners move to a hf but merge mine the old chain with empty blocks?" a good answer could be "then users can defend from this attack by changing pow". But I think it would be stupid to change pow without the majority of miners actively attacking the chains with the rules you want.
If some users want to do a controversial hf nobody can stop them, but there's no reason for users in each chain to attack the other one, right?
But if the majority of miners don't attack you, why are you defending against by changing pow?
 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:05:59


To give more than enough time to all users and implementations to adapt. For some people it will just mean upgraded to the newest bitcoin core version and they're done.
Others may need to adapt their own code, for example, alternative full node implementations like libbitcoin, wallets, service infrastructure based on bitcoin core or another full node implementation...
If we want an uncontroversial hardfork, it cannot be with 75% miner confirmation threshold because that's insecure (and the "veto power" argument doesn't apply if the change is uncontroversial) and 28 days deployment schedule (because that doesn't give everyone time to adapt and test their software even if they fully focus on it after the changed is locked in).
Insisting on 75% and 28 days is insisting on the hardfork being controversial (in that case, they could may as well 20 GB instead of 2 MB like they initially wanted or completely remove the limit like some of their comments seem to imply they ultimately want).
If that's the case, then we will have 2 chains.
I know some people say "we won't have two chains even with a controversial hardfork: all miners, users and developers will switch to the side with more hashing power".
That's not true. I'm not a miner, but as a user and developer I won't ever touch a chain with a controversial hardfork deployed against the will of their users. If I touch it, is just to sell all those coins at once.
If I'm the only one following the old rules, then I guess I will stop using Bitcoin completely and fully reconsider my professional career since my faith in decentralized currencies would be strongly damaged.
I would probably focus on local/community currencies and mutual credit or just completely abandon monetary tech and go back to artificial learning.
This is not a thread (not that I assume everyone thinks my contributions are very valued), just a fact. And I suspect that would be very similar to many other developers, users and people who have become professionally involved Bitcoin because they thought the consensus rules would only accept uncontroversial changes.
 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:38:24
BU or whoever can do a controversial HF whenever they want. There's nothing anybody can do to impede that. If they've not done it is because they didn't want to or they don't understand they can or something (maybe they believe they need hashrate majority for a hf, who knows).
I don't see how that has anything to do with segwit. If you like segwit as a user or not shouldn't have anything to do with BU or any hf proposal.

Maybe a lot of those txs will never make it into the blockchain. You cannot force miners to include any particular transaction, just create an incentive for them to do so through fees.
100 TB sounds ridiculously high. That means you probably have a relay policy that is too relaxed, thus making it very easy for malicious nodes to attack you by increasing the resources you spend while running your node.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:13:06
Users can decide already without Bitcoin Core specifically having to code things. 
The assumption was that segwit was going to be uncontroversial. Since it seems that may not be the case, some miners are not signaling it.
Posible next steps I see: finding out what is controversial about segwit, which users can harm and how, remove those parts and try again. Although users could have been given feedback much earlier, but it's not too late.
But if users don't say what it is they don't like about segwit, I don't see what's next, honestly.
As a dev, if what I think it's the safest size increase that can be deployed fastest is not being uncontroversial, It's not compelling to me to work on another size increase proposal that, being a hf, needs way more time to be deployed. If not everyone  wants the size increase in segwit, why would they all accept some other size increase?
Perhaps you can help me understand...

At a bigger scale (say 1 Million tx/s), mining centralization pressure would come from computing requirements (as I tried to explain in

Well someone can attack ETH/ETC or someone can attack Litcoin or Dogecoin or Bitcoin. I don't see how a controversial HF makes attacks more likely.
It seems to me that the incentives for ETH miners to attack the ETC chain are about as strong as the incentive for Litecoin miners to attack the Dogecoin chain. What am I missing?

Right, segwit changes the 1 mb size limit for a 4 mb weight limit, but the threaretical 4 mb limit cannot be really reached. There's 3.7 MB blocks on testnet.
2.1 MB is an estimation with the average usage of txs (transaction types, their structure) a few months ago (when it was proposed, the estimation result was 1.75 MB), but average blocks could be bigger than 2.1 MB depending on what types of txs are used more. Perhaps multisig usage rises after segwit is deployed.
Developers cannot decide what the average will be, that depends on what users do.
What can be done is changing that 4 MB weight to something bigger with a hf after segwit, but there's no guarantee that the community will be ok with that, even if someone from Bitcoin Core proposes it.
I still don't understand how you can claim you want  8 mb weight but you reject 4 mb and prefer to stay at 1 mb if the rest don't agree on increasing more.
Do you want bigger blocks or not?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:41:44
The "other side" used to be classic offering 2 MB.
Now segwit offers more than that but supposedly is not a compromise because now there's more extreme people who want unlimited blocks.
We cannot compromise with those, a half of infinite is still infinite. Unlimited blocks or giving the control of the size to miners will always be controversial to many users and therefore it can only result in 2 chains, because some users will always resist (assuming the users that want unlimited blocks go ahead and do their hf).
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:51:21
SPV wallets that "verify pow" also verify the difficulty adjustments and the block.nTime, right?
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:19:06
I'm happy with a hf to increase the size further as soon as I think it is uncontroversial among users, but it is not ven implemented. I'm not sure what "SW + 2 MB" means, segwit already gives you more than 2MB size, there's 3.7 MB blocks in testnet. Segwit gives you 4 MB weight. Does "Segwit + 2 MB" mean 8 MB weight?
I'm sure at some point that will be just fine. But I really really don't understand users that say they will only like segwit condionally to other users liking later hardforks.
If you feel doesn't hurt you as a user in any way and is reasonable, don't oppose to it. Blocking other people's desires won't help you convince them about your own.
If on the other hand you think segwit harms you or any other user in some way, please explain yourself so we can remove that part. If segwit is controversial the way it is today, let's just find something that everyone can accept.
But the attitude "I don't like segwit but I won't tell you why, let's negotiate a future hf as if the 2 of us could impose what we agree on now to others and depending on what we agree I will like segwit or not" is not productive at all.
I also feel that segwit as it is today is already a compromise: it allows bigger blocks than bitcoin classic's bip109. How is "more size than what you were proposing yourselves not too long ago" not a compromise on the part of so called "small blockers"?
 
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:44:30
Core didn't historically rejected the concept of hardforks, there's several hf proposals by core devs
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:04:41
We can test the "first HF" (arguably this has happened yet with the berkely DB thing) with anything else. For example something extremely simple and uncontroversial like the timewarp to make sure the HF can happen as soon as possible (see BIP99).
But I seem to be the only person interested in deploying a hardfork as soon as possible, many people disregard BIP99 because it does nothing to the block size.
Segwit could also be implemented as a HF and that could be arguably cleaner, but also much slower (with HF you have to give extra time to everyone in advance, because everybody [including all software, dependent on the reference implementation or not] needs to upgrade at the same time).
"A capacity increase as soon as possible" and "segwit should be deployed as a HF from the beginning, instead of a SF first and a cleanup HF later" seem incompatible positions to me.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:34:44


Segwit allows blocks bigger than 1.75 MB, that was just an approximation with usage statistics at the time of the proposal more than 1 year ago. With more current usage statistics, you would get something like 2.1 MB, but still, segwit allows more than that, maybe users start to use multisig more when it gets cheaper. There's been 3.7 MB blocks in testnet.
Segwit allows bigger blocks than classic's bip109, how is that not a compromise?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:17:54
No, Bitcoin classic was bip109 only, no segwit.

You cannot use Bitcoin without trusting a third party unless you validate the whole chain yourself (ie full node). That alone shoild be enough I think.

@_date: 2017-03-22 22:26:19
Maybe they can explain why not and perhaps the parts that are controversial can be removed from segwit. But they need to point out specific concerns they have with segwit, not with moderation in particular internet forums or talking about later changes they want apart from segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:14:42
Can you back up that claim? I believe most people not running full nodes trust specific nodes (even if thty don't run them themselves. What wallet connects to random nodes that is "used by most people". I'm afraid mist people just trust centralized wallets to validate the chain for them (and to not spy on them).
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:42:52
Well, not really useless because many merchants may consider these payments instant. It is not as good as waiting several confirmations but it is infinitely better than accepting 0-conf transactions.
You are just trusting that you will be able to publish an already signed tx to the blockchain in the next X blocks.
But yeah, I agree the biggest appeal is aggregating txs for micro-payments, which only increases demand for block space, doesn't reduce it.

They can connect their SPV client to their own trusted full node.

You don't lose any "negotiating power" by accepting something you want.
Bitcoin Core cannot decide changes to consensus rules unilaterally (nor miners, nor the bitcoin foundation, nor any other group of devs or people).
If users don't want 8mb blocks they cannot be forced, even if Bitcoin Core proposes it. Also blocking things proposed by bitcoin core that you want because you want to extort us into proposing other things we know some other users won't like can't force devs to propose those things either.
Let's all be reasonable and focus on things that everybody is likely to find acceptable, instead of trying to impose quid pro quo kind of "negotiations" as if there was only 2 sides or parties instead of many users with different opinions and interests in the technology.
@_date: 2016-03-27 13:11:04
I suggest you ay your own developers so that "Blockstream's involvement" is not so uncomfortable to you.  Warning: when you tell any dev to promote 2mb as a long term solution and segwit is a kick the can down the road...well, let's say they may ask you for more money or unilaterally  quit.

Why likely to the pow?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:02:12
segwit changes 1 mb size to 4 mb weight. Do you mean increasing from 4 mb to 8 mb weight? That could be done at some point when people are ok with it and it's shown that it doesn't have big centralization risks.
But why make one conditional to the other?
If you're ok with 8 mb, I cannot understand why would you oppose to 4 mb weight and prefer to keep it at 1 mb size if the rest of the users don't want to go as far as 8 mb like you yet.

If there's any problem with segwit I would expect that its opponent demand for things being removed from it, not added to it. Adding more changes seems like a good way to gain more opponents, not to apace those concerned with particular rule changes in segwit. 


Completely agree here, but each of them, not the majority or anything like that. Thus the need for users to accept changes that aren't bad to them, even if they want more changes that other users think they're bad.
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:23:39
I think the "too polite to nack" is indeed a thing.
Some times people really don't care about your change either way. But other times you feel like people are telling you "nothing wrong with this" but they secretely hope you give up, without twlling you explicitly saying it. Or you see things changing beneath you in directions away from what you need, making the rebase harder or even kibd of impossible without partually undoing that change.
I know it sounds paranoid, and that's precisely what I find most demotivating. If I'm told "no", perhaps I keep arguing for a while or get mad about it for a week. Not a big deal, I think. But when I don't understand what people think and I find myself wasting my time thinking about paranoid remotely posible explanations as to why my changes aren't being merged, that makes me feel very bad about myself in a way that tends to last longer.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:49:22
Making blocks smaller is a sf. And there's several hf proposals by bitcoin core contributors.

@_date: 2017-03-22 21:26:53
Again, by "segwit + 2mb hf" I guess you mean 8 mb weight as a hf after segwit.


You are free to release whatever you want or hire developers to do the changes you want.


How does miner signaling say anything about user consensus?
Users and devs get to know what the other users can accept or not talking to each other. But only if the users who oppose to something explain why.
I explained to gavin what I would have changed from bip109 and he ignored me.
Now users who oppose segwit can explain what they find unacceptable about it and those parts can be removed. But if the complains are "I oppose to segwit because it moves to 4 mb weight but I want blocks bigger than that, I want 2 mb blocks!", that apart from something that doesn't make sensen logically, it's not something that can be removed from segwit to make you happy.
Please, stop asking for other things when criticizing segwit. If there are other proposals, that's great, but let's evaluate what can be problematic about each proposal separately (and with rational arguments so that something can be done about them).

So why was 2 mb fine when classic proposed it but segwit, which gives you more it's not fine?
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:36:49
In nov 15 2017, if it didn't got 95% in a diff adjustment cycle, the deployment will be considered failed.
If users (miners are users too) can explain to developers which parts of segwit (bip141) they don't like and would like to see gone, it would be much easier for developers to try to come up with a less controversial proposal (if this is clear, we don't need to wait until nov 15 2017).
What I don't think many users realize is that arguments of the type "I wanted 20 MB blocks instead" is not saying anything against segwit, for as segwit only gets you closer to that goal.
As a user, is there any concrete change to the consensus rules contained in segwit that you would like to see removed? which one?
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:07:22
I don't know what you are quoting, but Segwit has been proposed as a softfork, not a hardfork.

@_date: 2017-01-04 12:03:03


So what? It doesn't mention the 21 M limit on supply, but it it's in the code from the beginning, just like the scripts.


In summary, leaving it for miners to decide instead of users. I (and I think many other users) would definitely not follow a hardfork to bitcoin doing that.


I've read a little bit, but I don't think I see the advantage.


"Fast transactions" is very relative here. A single 10 min block is way more irreversible than 10 minutes in blocks from ethereum.
Besides, I don't think people want transactions faster than 10 min, they want instant secure transactions (something payment channel networks like lightning can provide, at a much lower real costs due to having less redundant validation).


That's, maybe, because there's no real demand for block space in ethereum. Lack of use is definitely something from ethereum you haope to get for bitcoin.


Maybe by people that don't understand the system. They were never instant. "Cheap" is relative.
Anyway...your whole point is "cheap fees". But Freicoin (with even less usage) has even lower fees (with a design more similar to Bitcoin's).


Ok, still not something "Bitcoin can learn from ethereum", the idea is from the Bitcoin community, not from ethereum!!


There's simply no magic here, I'm tired to read proposal for "magical free p2p storage": they're simply fantasies.


Please, stop repeating this, it's annoying. Bitcoin had smart contracts long before ethereum existed or even before vitalik wrote articles on Bitcoin magazine. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 18:26:48
Arguably, even those not using segwit will benefit indirectly in terms of fees from the increased offer of space (or at least assuming fixed demand for block space).
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:05:04
"decentralized nodes" doesn't even makes sense to me.

People decide the code they run.
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:49:19


I think it pretty clearly was. Note that its scripting language even had some capabilities that were disabled.


It was litecoin which was supposed to be about "anti-GPGPU" and then "anti-ASIC" (and then they just sticked to the "silver to bitcoin's gold" discourse, once they had ASICs). Memory hard is not "anti-ASIC", it just means that the ASICs (if the block reward is ever high enough for ASIC producers to produce them) will need more memory than sha256d ASICs. Up to this date, I haven't heard any convicing arguments on why memory hard ASICs are more desirable. I really doubt Bitcoin, if it changes its pow, will move to a memory hard algorithm. I would arguee against it.


Not familiar with it, but if they don't have ahard limit on size, they simply don't have a limit on centralization. Again, not a good idea IMO (although flexcap could be interesting for Bitcoin).
 &gt; Ethereum's 12 second block times and low transaction fees would make Bitcoin a viable payment network again. 
Fastcoin was the coin who pioneered the notion of producing orphan/stalled blocks faster than Bitcoin. As usualk, not a good idea.


That's been indeed an interest of mine since I met Bitcon, see 
In Bitcoin there's colored coins, but are not validated by consensus rules.
Elements project is working on native support with multiple assets. Even if Bitcoin never gets this, sidechains to Bitcoin can do this. Anyway, wouldn't consider this "an idea from ethereum" (as shown I was proposing this long before ethereum or even colored coins where even theorized).


Not familiar with this, but blockchains aren't the best thing for storage. Using blockchains for storage is a pretty bad idea IMO too. Again, I don't think Bitcoin will ever adopt this (although as said I'm not that familiar with this).
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:43:23
No, Bitcoin is a smart contract plattform.
The idea of a "decentralized global computer" is simply ridiculous from a scalability point of view (even though it seems useful to pump the price of the coin).
Anyway, what concrete ideas or "imrpovements" do you think Bitcoin may use in the future? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 19:23:03
If they obstruct segwit, they obstruct a block size increase, which is what they have been crying for. For long. If they want to completely remove the limit (BU), they know not everybody will follow them and there will be 2 chains, thus it make no sense to coordinate miners with any particular hashrate threashold. I don't know what they are waiting for. They should go fork themselves already.

How is segwit, which increases size more than the 2 MB hf would have, not a compromise?
Nobody proposed a 2 MB hf with reasonable deployment schedule (ie BIP109 was only 3 weeks, and also it had 75% threshold).
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:26:46
Right, one "side" gave a block size increase without necessarily wanting it.
If you were a dev who, without being in those meeting and having warned that no private agreement necessarily represents the users, didn't signed this agreement and is still reminded about it every other day you wouldn't say "oh, I need to do what's in my power to try to force users to accept this agreement I haven't signed, and accept it myself". You would say "if you don't like the current consensus rules you can go fork yourself any day, without my or anyone else's permission or signature".
If we want to keep deploying uncontroversial changes we need to listen and to the concerns of those who don't like them. Did gavin listen about 3 weeks being crazy for a hardfork and 95% being better than 75% if bip109 was to be uncontroversial? No he didn't.
Do I want to listen to concerns about segwit changes? Yes, I want.
What would Haipo Yang change about segwit or what part he doesn't like?
I still don't know. He complains about Bitcoin Core without making informed criticism to segwit itself.
If you know of those concerns, which parts anyone considers controversial about segwit, I'm interested.
But if we're going to talk about an agreement I'm not part of, I'm sorry, I'm not really interested.

Like what?
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:42:10
Your mempool is the bucket of those transactions that you want to keep around.
There's no such thing as an "appropriate fee", there's just higher and lower fees. If miners are smart, they will clear the most profitable set of them every ~10 minutes. Txs with lower fees will have to wait more or maybe never clear depending on their fee.
Let's repeat this, some of the "queued transactions" may never be cleared by miners because there's always better tx in terms of fees per unit of space.
Let's say I create a 0.5 MB tx with 1 satoshi as fee. Well, that will likely remain on the "infinite memory mempool" forever, but likely never enter mempool with  reasonable sizes.
If the demand is so low that my tx would be accepted again for that ridiculous price and nobody else keeps it in their mempool, I can always relay it again.
Many low fee transactions at the same time could be considered an attack on large mempools, but the solution is trivial.
If the apparently sudden flow of new transactions has a high fee (I don't know) then they are outbidding you for clock space: pay more or wait more and live with it.

Sorry, my mistake. I thought you were one of those who are asking to completely remove the limit or leave it to miners to decide.
I don't feel I have the knowledge to talk about concrete numbers (besides poiting out moore's law is not a law and there's more resources involved than computing power), but that is indeed a completely different discussion.
I don't think size increases necesarily lead to 2 chains (as completely removing it would).
This means it is way more likely that we could as 2 individual users agree on changes we could both accept.
Given that I find the current segwit proposal acceptable, I'm particularly interested in what changes would you remove from it so that it becomes acceptable to you as well.
 &gt; I don't care if Blockstream employees receive part of their salary in Bitcoin. 
Well, you asked if I was paid by a company in the sector and whether or not I had Bitcoins. I answered. 


Our first commercial product is Liquid, which you can read more about here:
Beyond that, we're exploring other commercial projects with several potential customers and partners, and we have more ideas for products. But I cannot reveal more about that at this point, sorry.


Not only that, we're also forming new developers to contribute to the project.


Usually when private companies contribute to free software projects is because they are or plan to use them themselves. This is the case here as well. The elements project is a free software project that (like many altcoins) periodically rebases its code on top of Bitcoin Core's benefiting from any improvements made (not only by Blockstream employees, but improvements made my any of the many other contributors the Bitcoin Core project has).
Liquid is our first commercial product based on Elements, but we plan to do more things with it (and hope that the community finds it useful as well and contributes to the project).
Therefore we benefit from any improvement made to the Bitcoin Core code.


Actually this is not always true in the world of startups. Many investors put money into developing technology they think has great potential even without clear monetization plans. When the first investors put money into google, for example, they had an incredibly fast search engine, but didn't have plans for monetization yet.
I cannot talk on behalf of our investors as to why they invested in Blockstream, but some of them have stated it publicly, for example:

If segwit had been a hf, I would have asked for 15 nov 2017 instead of 15 nov 2016 for the bip9 start date.
If it's uncontroversial, it should be rewardless of being softfork or hardfork (hardfork just needs to be slower to give everyone time to adapt beforehand).
If it is controversial, it shouldn't be activated.
I'm still waiting to hear something reasonable the opponents of segwit would change about it (and, no, I don't treat "has to be hardfork because softforks are evil" as a reasonable answer).

Segwit includes a block size increase.
Segwit as a hardfork would be slower to deploy securely (maybe 2018 for start signaling, assuming it reuses bip9?) and come people were complaining about the urgency of increasing the size. I don't think it's really urgent, but if it was, segwit is the fastest way to deploy it securely.
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:07:38
Right, witnesses are cheaper because they can be prunned immediately instead of having to be stored by everyone for long (maybe forever), which is an unbounded total cost, still problematic after segwit (but a little bit better since signatures are usually the biggest part of txs).
That's how you get the bigger blocks (and presumably lower fees for everyone).
But there could be a segwit proposal without this change (that is, without size increase) if that's what some users don't like about it.
Would you agree with such a segwit softfork?
We could also weight witnesses differently without increasing the block size (but I assume you wouldn't like that).
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:06:31
Right, what you say would require a hardfork.
If segwit had been a HF instead of a SF, I would have suggested 15 nov 2017 instead of 15 nov 2016 for BIP9 start date (assuming the HF reuses bip9 for deployment, which doesn't really need to).
Old transactions will also benefit indirectly in the form of lower fees from the increase capacity, or at least in the sort term (until increased demand for block space fills the blocks again).

I've been championing the libconsensus approach over at Bitcoin Core (Matt Corallo's idea). It's supposed to become a "specification in code", which is what I think a consensus system needs. That way alternative implementations that have taken different design decisions (like libbitcoin or btcd) can be used securely without worrying about network splits or having to run Bitcoin Core nodes in between you and the network.
But there's alternative implementations and "alternative consensus rules". If you don't like the specification in libbitcoinconsensus (once it is finished), nobody can stop you or any alternative implementation from forking and changing the rules.
Ultimately, it is users who decide which "specification" they follow on their own. You cannot get more "decentralized decision making" than that: everybody does whatever they want, but nobody can force other to follow.
Having started later, ethereum could have started with a libconsensus from the beginning, for code is the most formal specification you can have and in that sense consensus system need "extreme formalism".

If you want to maintain a single chain (and currency), only changes that are acceptable to all users should be deployed.
It is about the users, not groups of devs or miners.
If users can agree on increasing the limit, we should increase it. But even if some users have been convinced that removing the limit is fine, other will never upgrade to a set of rules without a limit.
The "will of the developers" only matters insofar we're users too.
It's not about "Bitcoin Core blocking changes", Bitcoin Core doesn't have that power. It's about Bitcoin Core rejecting to include changes that can't be accepted by the whole community.

Well, segwit is a proposal to increase the limit. As a softfork, this is probably the fastest way to deploy an increase in size securely.

Even if you are right, they make a lot of noise. And Roger is one of them. 


Certainly not all people. What do you mean "no return"? If you increase the size now, and the demand for chain space remains the same, wouldn't you expect to see fees drop?


This seems a contradiction. Fees are too high but if they go down just a little bit they won't be enough for miners?

Payment channels are probably the best scalability solution for Bitcoin we currently know.


No matter how fast you scale, Bitcoin needs a competitive fee market in the long run to sustain pow once the subsidies are gone.
I am very happy that we have it now and wallets are finally adapting to be able to work with one. An increase in the size limit (like the one the current segwit proposal provides) could make the market disappear temporarily, but I believe blocks will soon be full again not very long after increasing size and I'm not very concerned about that.
We have it now and the world didn't ended like many claimed it would happen. It's just not something we need to fear, it's the way the system is supposed to work. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:20:46
Bitcoin Core hasn't added Payment Channels yet. The old designs relaying on a policy-only nSquence were broken. The lightning network is just a newtork of payment channels, with changes to the original designs (IIRC originally described by Satoshi) to make them secure and powerful (ie among other things allow transitive payments through them).
Payment channels are an old idea and now that we can actually have them in a secure and efficient way, some people seem to oppose them with nonsense arguments like "Lightning is not Bitcoin" or "although fees are 'too high' due to full blocks, Lightning will likely lower fees which is bad for miners".
All Lightning devs I know are assuming segwit will be deployed because that makes things more efficient. I assume the multiple Lightning implementations that are being worked on will be used for a while before Bitcoin Core's wallet adds support from them.

Because data that does to the utxo causes everyone to spend more resources than data that can be pruned directly after validating it.

The block size consensus limit is not new. 


You are confused. Bitcoin is a p2p system, not a centralized one. Neither Bitcoin Core, nor BU, nor Gavin, nor Roger nor anyone can force users to adopt changes to the consensus rules they don't like.

I disagree, If it was an feerate, you wouldn't see the flat orange line which means there wasn't really a few market, just a default value in wallets and nodes.

@_date: 2016-12-13 17:28:58
Why would he oppose the "economic change" in segwit? The "economic change" in segwit is bigger blocks, precisely what he says he wants.
Lightning is being tested and improved in testnet (where segwit is active), the intermediaries can be regular users and aren't strictly required (only if you want to do transitive payments across the network of payment channels, but you can open a payment channel with everyone you want to pay to or receive from if you want to avoid these intermediaries).
I believe I undesrtand Roger's background and believes and I still don't understand what he would remove from segwit to make it acceptable to him.
Note the word "remove" (ie even bigger blocks would be something to add, not to remove [plus it would require a hardfork]).
Maybe you can help clarify?
What do you think could be removed from segwit to make it acceptable to Roger (or to you, if you can answer that better)?
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:11:28
Hardforks can be secure too. Assuming they are uncontroversial (ie not something like completely removing the block size) they just need to give more time to users to adapt (since any user that hasn't adapted when the hf is activated will be kicked out, this doesn't happen with sfs).
I don't know what you mean by "the alternative to segwit". Segwit's complexity doesn't come from the fact that the size limit is being increased, but to me that is also one of the less interesting features.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:49:09
Actually prices have been more dynamic than ever. Keeping 1MB is definitely not "price fixing". It is a necessary limit for many reasons. This limit is not more "artificial" than the 21 M limit. But I'm actually in favor of increasing the limit wiht segwit.
Completely removing the limit or leaving it for miners to decide will always be controversial as a hardfork and, as such, will I think always produce 2 chains and 2 currencies. But if some users want to do a HF for removing the limit, there's nothing the rest of the users can do to avoid it. Note that for a contraversial HF, hashrate coordination isn't necessary and doesn't even make much sense.
The people who want a chain without limits to centralization can HF whenever they want. So far they've been complaining very loudly but mined a single block disobveing the 1 MB limit rule.
I really don't know what they are waiting for. Just like they can't be prevented from doing it, they cannot force other users to remove the rule, so waiting more time doesn't give them anything.
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:01:14


I agree they are different (I assume you mean segwit and BU's changes to consensus rule), but still segwit is a blocksize increase. Completely removing the size limit (as Roger prefers) will always be controversial.
He should go for it, but shouldn't expect all the users to follow him.
Do you know what is he waiting for to hardfork?
I really don't. He doesn't need to convince Bitcoin Core nor X% of the miners to do so. He just needs to mine a single bigger block with his pool.
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:48:10
Right, block wight is a compromise, "ok, if we are to increase the block size, we can start with the parts that are prune-able first as a softfork, which will make deployment faster".

It's not really about "transaction types" but about parts of the transaction. Segwit favors the signatures, which are very big, but can be pruned after validation instead of having to remain on the UTXO (potentially forever).


Open discussion about segwit implementation details have been occurring for long in many places. But it can continue. What is your own preference?


Of course, users are ultimately the deciders of the consensus rules they validate. As explained in BIP99, I personally believe that a controversial softfork should be answered with a hardfork undoing the parts that were controversial. But segwit hasn't activated yet, so if we can identify those parts maybe we can avoid activating segwit in its current form and propose another version with the subset of the changes that are acceptable to everyone.


I disagree.


Proposing an uncontroversial change that can be done as a softfork as a hardfork instead is delaying its activation unnecessarily (as you would need to give more time, since in a hardfork everybody needs to adapt before activation). Well, not only, there's additional risks. But assuming the change is uncontroversial it just doesn't make any sense.
On the other hand, if it is necessarily controversial I would prefer that we simply stop it before is activated.
I have yet to hear concrete new rules people that seem opposed to segwit would like to remove from it thought. I hear complains about the witnesses counting less for the block weight, which I don't really understand.
But even when I suggest a version of segwit without it (and therefore without a size increase), people usually reply that not increasing the size limit would be worse.


Users always decide what they run, but please don't confuse policy with consensus rules (not saying that you've done it, but "policy changes" is not an appropriate term here). There's many things users don't need to validate or even implement and can still keep validating the same consensus rules as everyone else.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:40:27
Unless they did follow the invalid chain. According to them is valid because "the block size is not a consensus rule".
If they were consistent with what they say, they would follow a different chain already (instead of protesting to other users for not having followed what they say but also don't do]).
They want everyone to do something they won't do themselves.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:16:15
If segwit is controversial, it could be possible to produce a reduced version of it without the controversial parts.
Making segwit a hardfork, or increasing the size further can't make it less controversial, only equal or more. If it fails like it is, I would suggest to propose one without the block size increase (and maybe also without the "discount" to protect utxo growth), as that seems to be the most controversial part in the proposal (although everyone protesting didn't seem satisfied by removing the blocksize increase).
If the community wants to miss this particular opportunity to increase the block size as a softfork, so be it. I don't think increasing the size is urgent. 
I also don't think people realize that hardforks take much longer to deploy securely, even assuming they're uncontroversial.
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:35:06
He overestimates "Core's position". Just like XT, Classic and Unlimited, Bitcoin Core cannot impose controversial changes either.

No I said it just as being the opposite of "price fixing".


Then call it "space supply fixing" or something. "Price fixing" is about fixing *prices*.


Leaving mining centralization preassures aside...
If Bitcoin was processing 1 M tps, would you be able to run a full node?


Popular opinion or not, both limits are defined by consensus rules.
I am familiar with Bitcoin's history, but that should be irrelevant unless you're ok with using logical fallacies in your discourse.


No, I don't want a chain without limits to centralization and I know many users  who think like me. Those users won't follow a chain without no limit and if there's people following it, well, then there will be 2 chains and 2 currencies.


I'm not sure what are you referring to. There was a failed attempt by some miners to remove the havening rule (that would have removed the 21 M limit) but no users followed.


So what? if one or both of the chains get stuck with too slow blocks, a hardfork lowering the difficulty as a one time thing would be extremely uncontroversial I think.


I'm not sure about this, maybe. The fact is that Bitcoin Core is propsing an increase bigger than that as a softfork and some people are complaining (although usually they can't say what they would remove to make segwit acceptable to them).


This is false, Bitcoin Core contriutors have proposed such hardforks and even bigger ones.


Non sequitur. Even if moving from 1 to 2 is fine, it doesn't prove that moving from 2 to infinite is fine too.


Sidechains are not a scalability solution and Blockstream doesn't currently have any plans to monetize Lightning. This is baseless speculation.


Yes, Blockstream.


I have. See our AMA. But I disagree, I believe logical arguments are logical arguments independently of where they come from. If I'm using any fallacy, please, point it out.

@_date: 2016-12-13 19:41:08


Where did I "fear monguered" about hardforks?


I think I understand, you think the problem is not that they may temporarily receive less reward with a size increase, but that they are currently receiving more than they would with a higher limit or no limit, and now after increasing they will need to adapt until fees rise again. Is that it?


I would be happy with a segwit that doesn't increase the size. But apparently everyone complaining about segwit wants a size increase.


You want to make things that remain in the utxo (maybe forever) more expensive that things that can be pruned immediately (the witnesses). This improves scalability. 
This allows you to increase the size at the same time, but you could do the same without increasing it (I don't think that would make less people complain).


I don't know how you "have been sold" segwit. I agree its increases to scalability and other features are much more interesting than the increase in scale/size. But it's seems some people were mostly excited about the increase in scale because they were asking for a hardfork increase to the scale (not to the scalability).

what you want is actually for it to not get to the mempool so that it never confirms.

No, you don't need to rely on 3rd parties to use payment channels.


Because 0.00210000 btc subdiy will be just fine?
I don't think anything is being pushed prematurely. We need a limit for several other reasons. There's proposals to increase it. I don't think it's urgent to increase it, but if you do, I think segwit is the fastest way to do so securily (remember a hardfork requires everyone to adapt before activation and that implies slower deployment).


Increasing fees is the argument I usually hear from people calling for an "urgent" increase in size. Completely removing the limit will always be controversial and you'll never convince everyone. Therefore it will always be a controversial hardfork that will most likely produce 2 chains and currencies.
I don't really know what the people who want to completely remove it are waiting for. Maybe you can explain.

If they're not using it, it doesn't decrease their "power". If they're using it, Greg's proposal for removing covert asicboost can be deployed without a hashrate majority.

In the worse case scenario, assuming segwit wasn't uncontroversial some users would follow a hf to remove the parts of segwit they don't want.

In my experience some "opponents" of segwit are actually ok with segwit, but just also want more things. Other times they are just confused about what segwit really does. For example, some have been told they cannot enjoy the discount for normal payments, but of course the new segwit format can be used for regular payments too.
I don't plan to use bip148 on my node, but as it is written, if the majority of the hashrate follows, my already segwit-ready node will follow that chain and fully validate segwit rules on it.

Segwit doesn't render asicboost ineffective, only the covert way of using it.
But it would be possible to deploy segwit without disabling covert asicboost. One way to do it would be to deploy segwit as a hf and move the witnesses tree from the coinbase to the header.
But why would we want that?
If all miners use asicboost there's no advantage for anyone. Only if some miners don't use asicboost it is an advantage for the miners that do (or for an attacker that uses it). Users don't gain anything either way (actually, they lose security if not all miners use it because an attacker could use it too).
But again we're not talking about asicboost in general, only the covert one that messes with softforks commiting things in the coinbase (although I would be in favor of completely disabling asicboost for the reasons above).

I tend to agree on a HF being more elegant, but softforks can be securely deployed much faster  IIRC BiP65 (op_cltv) was activated in a few weeks after release.
For anyone wanting "an increase in capacity asap", a SW as a softfork is the faster secure option.
For anyone wanting "any uncontroversial hardfork asap", BIP99 proposes something nobody would rationally oppose to (timewarp fix and maybe some other small cleanups).
I don't want to be paranoid, but it seems to me that classic is the option for those who want "a controversial hardfork asap" (specifically it needs to be rejected by bitcoin core). I would be happy to discover or be explained that this is not the goal some of its supporters have at hard (specially jgarzik and gavin).
@_date: 2016-02-22 13:31:55
No, it's easy: regarding bitcoin  (and specially the blocksize "debate") all opinions are personal. When you read or here ANYONE from Blockstream talk about hardforks or the blocksize take it as his/her own personal opinion.
There's no "official Blockstream's position on the blocksize" despite what you may read on the interwebs. 
It is common that we have similar opinions on many subjects though (but that is also common with many other non-blockstream bitcoin core developers).

May you explain what the heck is a "lightning address" and how it differs from a "bicoin address" (given that lightning txs are just bitcoin txs)?
@_date: 2016-02-22 13:56:55
As I understand it from the text, they're following bip99 recommendations for uncontroversial hardforks. That is, instead of having "miners vote" first and a "grace period" later, you have a "minimum deployment date" (july 2017 in this case) and then miners' upgrade confirmation of 95%.
If the hardfork is truly uncontroversial and the "minimum deployment date" really gives time for everyone to upgrade, by "minimum deployment date" about 100% of the miners will have upgraded already.
Assuming bip9 is used for activation, that would mean one difficulty retarget period (14 days aprox) for getting locked in and another one to activate it.
In summary, this could likely be activated around august 2017.

They chose the free software they run to interact with Bitcoin. If they don't use free software, then they have no control, then the developers of that software decide for him.
You said it yourself, users can use nodes that validate the rules they want.

The coins can still be separated.
With half price and hashrate each, both would have blocks twice as slow until diff adjustment, no?
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:04:43
"If 90% hasrate mines x2 and not bitcoin for months" . That's a strong assumption. I find that very unlikely unless x2 reward is 10 times bigger than bitcoins, and that not even counting diff adjustments. We will see when we have 2 separated prices. I believe x2coin's price will actually be lower tgan Bitcoin's, like it happened with bch.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:37:27
I also won't work on x2coin, even if Bitcoin dies after the hf, which I think is extremely unlikely.

Bigger blocks make the network "less secure" by making mining more centralized (yes, even more than today).
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:36:29
No, I mean txs in each chain can be incompatible. For example, by spending the same outputs differently. Or just by coinbases for the same height paying to different outputs.

I'm "against" bip148 because I think it's too rushed, and making it August instead of October for no good reason didn't help. But I am not against uasf in general and I support bip8 and bip149. At the same time if bip148 deploys successfully I won't resist, since I want segwit. I think it's more risky and we're not in a hurry, certainly not for a size increase (that should never be an "urgency" imo), so why take more risks than we need to? bip149 seems at all lights safer than bip148 for segwit uasf. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:46:52
I don't want to give extra time to miners but to users. Can we at least agree that bip148 would have been less risky if it had said October all along instead of August? Now it's probably too late to change. 
To reiterate, I'm completely in favor of uasf itself. Also agree that ideally miners would signal sw before August and that would remove any risk.

Gavin is not a founder of XT. Mike had forked XT long before Gavin joined it, and nobody had any general issues with yet another reimplementation of the protocol (there's plenty: libbitcoin, libcoin, haskcoin, u/petertodd's RBF releases...) until it contained a schism hardfork (although some people have specific issues with some other patches merged in XT).
Neither Bitcoin XT nor Bitcoin Core (nor any other implementation) controls the specification of the consensus rules: nobody can force other people to validate a given set of rules over another.
But if the community runs 2 incompatible rulesets then they will end up following different chains and we will have a Schism hardfork with unpredictable consequences (because social systems are complex systems).
When I release the first version of Bitcoin JT (after 0.12) with no Schism hardfork in it, I'm sure I won't be able get as much attention as Bitcoin XT and I'm sure moderators won't do anything at all about conversations related to Bitcoin JT (assuming they happen at all).
I dislike Bitcoin XT being called "an altcoin": to me it's just an alternative implementation that happens to have merged a Schism hardfork (see BIP99). But I completely understand a moderation policy that discourages the promotion of Schism hardforks. In fact, given that forums are (necessarily) centralized, I can understand that different forums have their own "inconsistent" policies supporting some specific schism hardforks but not others.
I'm afraid people are confusing censorship (an attack on freedom of speech) with forum moderation (which is precisely a mechanism for moderators to express their freedom of speech by being able to select which contents appear in their webs/channels they control).
If reddit decided to close r/bitcoinxt or any other channel dedicated to the same topic (or kick theymos out of his own subreddit) then I could, maybe, consider that censorship. And I say maybe because reddit.com's is reddit's even more than r/bitcoin is the moderators'.
Ironically enough, forum moderation is a beautiful and simple analogy to explain Schism hardforks. I've repeatedly heard the argument "Schism hardforks don't mean 2 different currencies because all users and miners will be forced to follow the majority".
This is of course just an analogy and not a logical argument, but let's say r/bitcoin and r/bitcointx implement 2 different moderation rulesets, A and B respectively. There's of course also r/libbitcoin more channels following either policy A or B. Let's say we have 3 groups of users X, Y and Z that only participate respectively in forums which with ruleset A, B or both.
The claim that "forums following moderation rulesets A and B will eventually all follow the same moderation policy that the majority follows: doesn't seem so logical, does it?
In the blockchain case, X users will trade in markets implementing A, Y users will trade in markets implementing B and Z users will trade in both. W users are unaware of the existence of A and B moderation ruleset and typically only use a few forums/implementations (with their corresponding channels/rulesets).
Can anyone make any prediction about the evolution in the number of users in A or B (or about the price of currencies a and b) only from this information?
Can anyone predict the eventual abandonment of rulesets A or B?
No.  
Are users reporting to "observe majorities" aware of all possible relations between reddit's "karma" and sybil attacks?
Obviously not.
Is it therefore a measurement of "a majority against theymost" observable?
Probably not. Almost certainly not in the interwebs.
Does bip99 have support from the majority of bitcoin users?
3 pictures are worth more than 3000 words:
I know what you are thinking...these are 5 pictures, not 3, but...
As shown in these pictures, the majority of Bitcoin users seem to be in favor of bip99.
Should I leave reddit right now and go back to work on bip99's content?
100% certainty.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:04:30


Yeah, miners have had plenty of time to increase the block size by activating segwit. They could have activated it in 2016!
And it's not too late now.


Yep, already reviweing bip8 and bip149 in case miners haven't signaled sw by nov2017 !
Just sad that miners in the agreement don't seem to be honoring their commitment to "support segwit immediately".
BIP91 can lower sw threshold to 80% without being conditional to any later hardfork (and a later hardfork is not guaranteed by activating sw in this way, pre-bip91 nodes will see sw active without needing any hf code, or they can only implement bip91 as it is now without including any hf code).
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:24:29


What happens when smaller blocks mean smaller fees and that you are no longer competitive?


Matt Corallo's relay network has several centralization problems that it's own author not only doesn't deny but actually has publicly explained in several places. 
IBLT has some "uniform policy" problems that now I believe can be solved. But as you say this is work in progress. Development in this reward may reduce the mining centralization risks of increasing the block size just like other works in progress (for example payment channels, including lightning payment channels) may change the perception that "bigger blocks will be needed soon".
Let's solve the issues before we take the risks and it will be less probable that we accidentally kick small miners like you out of the market by rushed decisions. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:45:04

Jorge Timón from Blockstream here.
I proposed "gateways" long before Ripple Labs even existed, I just named them "Proxy nodes":
It turns out Ripple Labs is pedaling back to something more similar to the old Ripple Distributed Protocol, a design I contributed to:
Putting ripple in a chain wasn't their idea either:
I also explored the possibility of using OT for implementing a distributed Ripple protocol, but OT doesn't support inter-server atomic transactions.
Then I continued working on a design that allowed atomic transitive (ripple-like transactions) between many private/federated blockchains (and up to one pow chain) and involving many assets: 
I also tried to explain (without success) why "trust lines" weren't needed for transitive transactions and how to "ripple" interest-bearing assets, but David Schwartz preferred to insult me and try to convince me that "interest isn't necessary at the core level" (ignoring my example use cases) over trying to understand what I was telling him: 
I also made other design suggestions like one for enabling the destruction of an account, and Jed McCaleb said "This is a clever idea but I don't think it is worth doing.": 
But apparently he changed his mind when he moved to Stellar since Stellar allows you to delete an account.
About other suggestions I made privately they told me "it could work like this but it is too late to change the architecture so radically since while still in beta and without publishing the code we have already distributed some XRPs and we would need to restart the ledger".
I really love Ryan Fugger's original ideas, but I don't think ripple.com is a good implementation of those ideas.
All the features that the old Ripple distributed protocol v0.6 supported and more were supported by freimarkets (plus multisig and everything else Bitcoin has). All the features that freimarkets supported (and more like Confidential Transactions) will hopefully be eventually supported by the sidechain elements free software (the software Liquid uses): 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:14:49
To avoid waiting time for BTC to move from one exchange to another, traders doing arbitrage between the different exchanges would usually just have enough btc on both sides at all times. Since liquid enables faster BTC transfers between exchanges, a trader will be able to do the same trades without having to have extra bitcoins in several exchanges (so their capital requirements are lower).
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:30:04
What I'm referring to is adding a rule that the next block after lock_in/activation is not only allowed but required to have the hardfork bit set, thus becoming an invalid block for all nodes unaware of the hardfork (although an special alert could be deployed in advance of any hardfork using this). In that case, if miners override the version field removing the hardfork bit, then their block will be invalid for nodes enforcing the hardfork.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:39:36
I don't see how sw activating before the bip149 should be a problem for bip149 nodes, the current implementation just needs a simple change I have in code. So I assume that the problem is if it activates after the current timeout, pre-bip149 nodes interact badly with post-bip149, because one group thinks sw is not active while the other knows it is. But I don't know the details as to why that would be a problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:27:28
No, they can signal both.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:02:31
As long as bitcoin remains decentralized and transactions irreversible, there's no reason why fees have to be proportional to the amounts sent like in paypal and other reversible systems.
Micro-transactions are better implemented with smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. More specifically, payments channels like satoshipay and others implement or like those used for the lightning network.  
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:15:54
nVersion &lt; 0 can't be facked: it will result in an invalid block unless your hf explicitly allows it for one block. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:25:47
Well, if they "fake" the hardfork bit their block will be invalid, right? What am I missing.
This was my recommendation for activation to btc1 alongside using bip8 to coordinate activation (and decoupling it from bip141 and bip91 signaling, and more reasonable deployment schedules). But they were ignored them like other suggestions.
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:30:23
Yes, and that's hard. In this case, it seems obvious that it was controversial given that we have two chains.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:10:49
You mean a controversial hardfork that classic users reject?
Well, still in that case, they made the choice of rejecting the hardfork and continue following their own rules in their own chain. Nobody can force users to make any change they don't like.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:57:57


Do you think dividing a currency into 2 currencies won't cause chaos?


The hashrate tells you nothing about what the users will do. What if you get the majority of the hashrate but 95% of the users don't accept the hardfork? what if all of them decide to run the "new chain" in parallel just to sell all their "newcoins" as soon as they can?


Why not a "spin-off" ala aethereum then?


Yeah, that could potentially cause the same communication problems.
 
@_date: 2016-07-21 12:04:11
What's "artificial" about more users running full nodes? Not having to trust someone else is in their best interest.
I agree there should be hardforks, but not controversial ones.
Controversial chains result in either:
- Minority users being disenfranchised.
- Two chains surviving, resulting in 2 currencies with different prices and chaos (specially for exchanges, which may be legally required to support both).
 
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:33:33
Well, it may take some time to deploy a hf because all the users need to upgrade before activation or they will be at great danger. But deploying things slowler to be safer it's fine with me. Especially for things that aren't urgent like a size increase.
I'm more eager for segwit's malleability fix than for its size increase. But if some people can get some size increase as they claim to want faster because it is a softfork, then better.
We should increase size when we safely can, not when blocks get full.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:08:05
Besides, bip91 is only useful if 80% of the hasrate actually signals it (and we're not close to that with bip141 at the moment).
Where can I read more about "bip91-b" ?
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:34:15
False dilemma, but it is true that if bitmain forks off with a hf before bip148, bip148 becomes less worrisome to me, since it makes a fast unification (between bip148coin and legacycoin/bitcoin) far less unlikely (since the hashrate in the hardfork has no influence over either the legacy chain or the bip148 chain).
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:02:15
I was "evaluating" because I think the proposal isn't clear at all and I was hoping I could find out what the proposal means more concretely by reviewing of the code.
It seems my review is being largely ignored and I don't feel my doubts are being clarified.
I offered my help to try to make the hardfork proposal more acceptable, but if I don't hav big hopes that my feedback will actually be used.
I will work on my own hf proposal, which is very simple and doesn't touch block size instead, but I don't think there's that much interest in having the first hardfork for the shake of having it.
In any case, I put my opinion there because I was asked, but I don't see myself as an oracle that people should consult. There's even people that have start contributed to Bitcoin Core later than me (2014) that have already contributed more than me in my opinion.
I may score high on  but not all commits or line changes take the same effort or help in the same way. And although I'm proud of my contributions I perfectly realize other people's contributions are much more important than mine.
Obviously my opinion is important to myself and I like it to be heard. But I wish people focused more on the ideas themselves instead of who they hear them from, who originated them (although giving credit where is due is important too) or who supports them.

Is it better to always allow miners to veto consensus changes?
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:40:44
They don't intrinsically have veto power over consensus changes, but bip9 gives it to them. Using bip8 to deploy future consensus changes (which doesn't give them veto power) is not "removing miners", they can keep doing their function. Perhaps we should use bip8 or plain bip9 depending in the change, but at this point it's pretty clear ro me that we should have used bip8 for segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:40:21
If there's nothing wrong with segwit for users, they shouldn't block it just because they also want other things. It is as absurd as to absurd to oppose to 10 mb because you want 20 mb.
Fortunately, for future changes, we don't have to give miners the power to block changes, we can use bip8 instead of bip9.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:51:30
You are wrong, the privacy leak has to do with bloom filters.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:36:23
1) The proposal isn't completely clear about what the hf increment actually does. In the PR, they keep discussing about changing segwit's discount, having 2 limits and other things.
2) The proposal tries to couple hardfork activation to sf activation, but that doesn't work: even after segwit is activated, users can reject the hf, they are still 2 different consensus changes.
3) It is based on bip91, which although isn't flawed in itself, it requires 80% of the hashrate wanting to activate segwit for it to be useful at all, but it doesn't seem like 80% wants to activate segwit from current's segwit signaling.
4) The vaguely proposed increase it's not based on simulations to gather data, such as those jtoomin and Rusty did.
5) The hf lacks some some protections like the hf bit and doesn't use bip8 for the hf activation.
6) The suggested deployment schedule for the hardfork is too rushed and not conservative enough.
  
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:25:19
I'm also against controversial softforks. The main difference between uncontroversial softforks and uncontroversial hardforks I would say is deployment time (ie uncontroversial softforks can be much faster)
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:10:00
Because their interests may not always be aligned with those of users' or they can attempt to use that veto power to as a negotiation tool, as we've seen with segwit/bip141
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:04:56
It is not core who is blocking segwit's size increase, which could have been activated long begore fees went to the roof. It's not too late. After segwit's increase, more increase via hf will be reasonable eventually, but not until segwit blocks get full imo.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:05:56
I disagree, I think it is better in every way.
