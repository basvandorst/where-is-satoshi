looks like the bubble did burst and now its stable .. i think the worst is over and maybe a more stable increase will happen now.

Yeah for sure I love the silence of the doubter who is saying that the future of bitcoin is over or dead. Well, I guess that should help them better not to doubt in bitcoin and the power of the cryptocurrency. Now asides from that reason I am also happy caused this means it will be a good year-end for Bitcoin especially now that the price is rising back it's good to sell some of my bitcoins before 2018 comes.

has the BTC bubble ends after the peak or will be the future of currency that we can use in our life ?Knowing that its founder is unknown and it is known that everything unknown does not continue to the end.
very important question for discussion

Now the situation to analyze, bitcoin is really high quality assets. Because it does not inflation, its total amount is constant, unlike paper money, which can be printed at will. I think there will be more and more people who hold bitcoin in the future.

Not surprised. that's quite a conservative prediction. We have touched $20K already in 2017, only needs doubling to take us to $40K next year at some point which is pretty easy given btc's volatility.

Doubt it, if the climb is to high, to soon, a lot of people dump and it plummets.

This move will definitely motivate more people to see crypto currency as not just a phase.

I hope you are right :) $30k would be a blast....... remember nothing is impossible in the world of crypto, also 2 weeks is a long long time! What if all these bankers get their huge bonuses in the week after the 15th and start piling into bitcoin during the third week in jan? That could drive it up rapid, but how high?? Time will tell dear friends :) relax and enjoy the show....

Dip occurs because of these ICO's . Recently 400 billion $ is wiped by the government.
News media blame only bitcoins, reputation is affected by this
forget whales and blah blah.. companies lose money and public also and these all factors bring Dip.
