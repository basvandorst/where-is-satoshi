what about the Great Depression? What about Germany after first and second World War? The money has always been "reset" to zero or rebuilt from scratch.
And what about recent news about the shutdown in the U.S. where the states were not able to pay their officials and public buildings anymoe?
I definitely don't trust in fiat money. There is a very huge hole under $ and € and it is just a matter of time if these constructs built on depts collapse.

That is of course right. But the question was -why- people are willing to buy for 15$ less and if there are some corresponding news.

The central bank can issue statements and disposals to which one MUST adhere. They can simply dictate the rules everyone has to submit to.
In contrast the core developers make "suggestions" on how to improve the bitcoin code, which is transparent and freely visible on Github. If they issue some code that meets with opposition, it is likely because of the public resistance, this will not be implemented.
Where centrals banks can be compared to dictatorship (yes I know the exaggeration), the core developers can be compared to a committee that acts transparent and includes public opinion.

this is the worst, most obsolete and most deprecated guide I've ever read.
"volume instead of content"........

this is just a guess by you. I am definitely of the opinion that is has the potential to overwhelm fiat currencies and make them absolutely obsolet. I also suggest people to avoid paying taxes related to bitcoin, don't be fooled by the authorities!
it's just a question of attitude. from a purely technological view bitcoin has all the tools ready to replace our current currency system, but which state stands and watches their taxation money and gag-like taxation policies beeing nullified

well I have tried them for 1 month now and always got my coins in and out without any problems. they don't even take transaction fees. but maybe the more time passes, the more people deposit their coins, there will be the point when they just take all the coins and run with the money :-)
i would recommend the following strategy: just deploy as much as you can afford to loose without being broke and just enjoy the daily ~1 to 2% ROI :-)
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:34:20
that's not an answer to the question.
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:00:58
you made my day!

this is not quite right. dollar and especially euros are not fully backed up by real values such as gold or something that has been worthwile since ages. so if there was a bank run on FIAT money, even the FIAT house would collapse.

Just check twice a day the bitcoin chart and buy when you think a bottom is reached. then sell a bit higher, but don't be too greedy :-)
I think this replaces the concept of finding a "global-over-one-year" bottom line.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:23:09
no real proven news at all. just rumors and bad gut feelings. see it as an opportunity to get cheap coins when the bottom is reached

if your question is serious: a guide to mining should explain HOW to set up a mining rig? you only say "you need some hardware", but not how to set it up. and how to set up cgminer? which version? which config parameters? how to make an autostart script? what about linux? what about raspberry pi?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:11:51
it's pure believe. people trust that they get something "worthful" in exchange for bits and bytes (=bitcoins). this is working as long as everyone believes it. 
same as with dollar or euro banknotes made of paper. people BELIEVE that they can get something in exchange for just "paper"

burn in hell, bastard for posting such scam shit

Possible scenario : Mt.Gox was robbed (like Silk Road) or lost a **huuuge** amount of Bitcoins due to the Transaction Malleability glitch which they simply ignored while ~~writing~~ tinkering their trade engine.
Now they need cheap coins to refill their losses and when they're operable again they will say "hey, we're back, here we go" and have a lot of coins which increase in value significantly :-)
Well I *think* that this is the most probable scenario to my mind
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:27:36
but why? :-)
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:51:41
You paid 32€ for this little meal?????? This is nuts.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:14:52
fucking retard. trying to spread panic by posting false stuff. may you get struck by a lighting bolt while on the toilet
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:18:48
i like rumours. we're all just speculating. rumours are great for making profit :-)
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:10:13
the title is not misleading. the funding option via the personal account has been removed (**apparently**).
BUT: it should be proved by providing a google translation and link to the original website and source of this piece of information
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:21:09
in the long term, *I* think you're doing right, because when I accumulate every pro and con of bitcoin and national fiat currencies, I find bitcoin way superior to every other currency.
And it's like a poisonous dagger into the backs of these corrupt banking system
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:13:49
buy NOW!
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:06:07
this market is about speculating! so posting rumours is legitimate when I explicitly declare it as a rumour
