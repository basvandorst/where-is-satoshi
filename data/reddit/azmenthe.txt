Yea this is the first time I've actually sent BTC in a charitable manner and it felt great. The first 20 minutes made me completely forgot my narrow-minded perspective on cryptocurrency and for the first time I felt like I was participating in the actual change that is bitcoin.

Haha, it's a BetaBrite LED ticker with some custom software. I'd be happy to open source the software but I'm not sure how expensive the BetaBrite's are...
I got 3 secondhand for free from my last job at a hedge fund.

In a pitch black warehouse operating with only a single desk lamp and slide rule, an endless swath of mathematicians work to brute force encryption. A single Pentium III would of sufficed but the NSA would have nothing of it.

Well I think the meaning here is, total risk is the amount of value put in, where reward can be multiples of that. Price can't drop below $0.

I haven't yet. Was on vacation for the holidays. I'll try to do a quick write up this week.

Thanks for the link, yea I figured there was a cheaper way to get an LED ticker, I just happened to have a few for free!
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:03:25
Wahoo! My first bitcointip! Yea I'll definitely do a write up on how I built it. I'll clean up the software to be LED ticker hardware agnostic.

Variation in payout and expected increase based on..... historical data? You invalidate your own definitions as well. What else is there besides historical data?
Without diving too deeply into the semantics of risk and reward I was merely trying to clarify [statement.
