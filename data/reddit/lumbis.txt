Do we know why? Is it not possible to add? Missing API features?

Maybe this might help you decide on what to invest in.
"Kraken, in partnership with The Economist, asked MBA programs from around the world the following question:
    You have $1M to invest across bitcoin and ether. You cannot touch your investment for the next 5 years. How much of that $1M do you invest in each? Why?
Each of the thirteen participating teams produced both a 5 minute video and a detailed, analytical paper explaining their answer and reasoning. Watch the short videos that each team presented to argue their case. Then help us determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners of the contest by voting for your favorites below. $18,000 in total prizes go to the top 3."

Hmmm, so why not also put in a time variable? Like if the block has not been created within 3x the normal rate then drop the difficulty.

Hmmm, I need a deeper explanation. 
Just because the power is halved does not automatically result in 50% slowdown in all systems. Say you have two users each sitting in front a computer. They both see a 1000 boxes on the screen and their goal is to find the one box with the reward (say box  If they both adopt the same strategy and click the boxes in order 1,2,3... then it would take just as long for only one user to do it (or a million users). Even if they click around randomly they would unknowingly to some degree click the same boxes ergo the added benefit of the extra person would not be linear.
I guess this analogy is no good since the number of boxes in bitcoin is 2^256? So the chance of "redundant" work is minimal.

"This warning is triggered when more than 50 of the last 100 blocks have a version number that Bitcoin Core does not expect. Currently that is being triggered by miners mining for BIP 91 (aka the first half of segwit2x). These miners are setting bit 4 of the block version field, and Bitcoin Core does not expect this to be set."

Then why was the adjustment rate set to 2016 blocks and not 1008 or 504?
