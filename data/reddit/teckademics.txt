I'd be 100% in support of this. I was on a bit of a trip today on 
View this sub 2, 3 even 4 years ago and it was the same people making a post a day about bitcoin being dead and crashing.  Even when bitcoin was $12, people were complaining about it going up or down $0.05

Coinbase is best for starters. Make sure you put in atleast $50 though as fees can be killer at lower amounts, especially under $10

Exactly this. It could be 5+ years before you see your money back if you even get it back. FDIC is a "Get your money back as long as you meet our terms and conditions and provide lots of documentation"
