Without grabbing for the pitchforks and bansticks, can anyone provide input as to how this could have been prevented, or prevented in the future? Some type of oversight is necessary. Learning that an exchange is incompetent after a $460M loss isn't exactly cost effective.

It seems that Pock.io would seek to limit my purchasing options based on a temper tantrum. I don't know who is worse, the so-called "community" for asking for this to happen, or Pock.io for actually listening to said "community".

Version 1.0: Says "Lulz" 10 times.
Version 2.0: Now says "Lulz 10 times.
Version 2.1: Now says "Lulz 12 times.
Version 3.0: Now says "Lulz 30 times, but breaks everything.
In a nutshell, version control software lets programmer A and B work on copies of the same code. For instance, let's say both you and me are working on two different pieces of a web site, using the same page. With version control software, we can each check out a copy of the site, and work independently. We can both test independently, and when it comes time to publish, or "commit" our code, we can do so to the production code. It's like taking a copy of a document, modifying the copy, and keeping the original as a prior version. 
**Edit**: Formatting.

This is great press for Bitcoin, and for Latin House - Burger &amp; Taco Bar (great food)!

I think that what will ultimately give us higher quality (more accountable, more ubiquitous) exchanges is competition. Not only that, but this is a business, and people who understand the business of finance need to be the leaders at these exchanges. Not every coder gets to be Gates and Zuckerberg; we all need a little Ballmer and Sandberg in our lives.

As a fan of Bitcoin from the outside looking in, I can't help but notice what appears to be arrogance on the part of the community. Regardless of what issue is exposed, or opinion is shared of Bitcoin that isn't a positive one, it seems like y'all continue to evangelize the system in a "nothing to see here, move along folks" type of way.

Some say laughter is the best medicine. I wept as I watched this. Am I doing this right?

How is this superior to actual cash?

I would be more inclined to take the community seriously if they stopped referring to the monetary value of things in USD, and instead in BTC. 
"I'll be you 1.23 BTC that bitcoin's first hard fork works out just fine". 
Meh - maybe y'all are right. That sounds stupid.
