Invest in BTC, and in the same time spend it. If BTC significantly increases in value and in adoption then why would I exchange it for USD if I could use it instead. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:47:43
..and people say bitcoin is outdated
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:05:39


What do you want me to do then? Email every single person who's putting a stupid amount of money on bitcoin telling them how bad they're doing?




What do you propose doing then? Some people are simply blinded by the idea by them thinking that investing in bitcoin will give them 100% chances of being rich in the future; and I'm sure most of the people here agree that that's false. Just because you see those cringy "moon" or "lambo" posts it doesn't automatically mean everyone thinks like that.

Who said mcafee was bitcoin's frontman in the first place?


That was their stupid mistake. They invested a lot of their money knowing the risks due to volatility(or not), and they lost. Risk management should be practiced with any kind of investment, not only with bitcoin.

OP was referring to bitcoin core, the software.
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:46:37


So they didn't know that anyone can create hundreds and thousands of wallets? Lol
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:57:51
You start to feel that bitcoin is bs just because you're not getting the "lambo" that you wanted?
Edit: typo
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:47:42
Can you give me more names then? McAfee and some of those "guys like mcafee" are only a few out of many enthusiasts of bitcoin. With any kind of industry there's always going to be "those" kinds of people.


Pretty much. So what's your point? It's not like people doing stupid things with their money is something new.
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:22:22
SEO, to be specific.

Since you said you originally used Jaxx, I'd assume you're using a mobile device. So personally I'd go with Samourai or Copay.
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:55:45
Or maybe the "B" could mean other things? Like maybe OP's surname?
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:11:26
And take note that the dude with $10,000 didn't spend less than a hundred dollars for a decent hardware wallet. This is honestly concerning.

I really don't see a problem with this. You can buy stuff on a Japanese website with your USD, but they convert the USD to JPY because they prefer to keep JPY. I really don't see a problem.

It's not like he implemented KYC just because, it's mostly probably because of government intervention. ShapeShift is a business to start with anyway. And he definitely wants that business to not get shut down.

How the heck are stocks going to go away? I'm bullish on bitcoin but damn you really need to be realistic.

I don't find his move unethical at all. It's not like you were forced to submit your information; if you don't want to, then don't.
Also, who are we to judge Voorhees for his decisions? We don't know the full story.

You can't stop forks. People will fork all they want. And there's nothing we can do about it.
As with Linux, Linux having a good number of distributions is actually a good thing. Each distro has their advantages, which cater differently from person to person.
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:20:02
Not impossible, but probably not anytime soon. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:37:08
Well, yea. That's one. Though I don't think every single bitcoin ATM is anonymous.
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:24:24


No one said that though.
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:11:00
I really don't know either. I think the only people who buy BTC on ATMs are the people who don't have an idea on high the fees are.
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:39:08


Haha no. Fees are huge.

Unpopular opinion.
People forget that Voorhees is running a business. And to make sure that their business will stay up, they have to adapt to regulations. I don't think Voorhees is "selling out", but instead just playing it safe for his business to stay up.
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:52:34


I disagree. It's mostly because Linux is mostly for the more tech savvy people rather than due to the excessive number of distros.
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:55:20
As much as people hate them, no. I don't realistically see them dying any soon.
