It also doesn't work for people who don't have at least one of their devices on at all times (phones excluded, bandwidth too expensive).
BTSync is a great tool for even semi-technical folk but it's not something I'd expect most people to be able to use. Dropbox is which means any decentralised Dropbox competition needs to be in order to gain widespread adoption.

Of course there are situations where one method is better than the other but as far as government tax offices are concerned just be consistent. Sometimes you'll lose, sometimes they'll lose.

Each Tor node your data is transmitted through only knows which node the request came from and which node the request is going to. They do not pass any additional information about original source etc which is where they differ from normal network nodes/protocols.
The packet doesn't actually resolve to an external service until it hits an exit node. Therefore an exit node can only see where traffic is going.
Because each internal Tor node only knows which Tor node sent it the packet and has no idea how many or which other nodes (if any) the packet has already been through an individual node cannot tell where a packet originates from.
An entrance node can only see where a packet originates from but not where it is going as the packet does not resolve until it leaves through an exit node.
All of these rules combined mean that, provided they pass through at least one honest Tor node, your packets cannot be 100% reliably traced.
There are some issues that have come to light recently but the above is how it is supposed to (and mostly does) work as per the original paper.

I think what they meant to say was OAuth is inherently capable of supporting fine-grained permission control but it is up to the provider (Coinbase in this case) to implement it.
Coinbase uses OAuth so it is technically possible they just haven't done it yet.

You can use Tor and HTTPS together.
