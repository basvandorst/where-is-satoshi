This is what I mean, correct.

thanks. I guess I mean the goal of those initiatives are good in theory, but the means by which they're doing them aren't good.

the goals of attacking the transaction cost issue. Which seems to be the primary messaging when researching Bcash/2x content from supporters.

+ $60/coin so far. 
I had just cashed out 12 BTC at $260, then rebought at $250 when the announcement broke. Good news!
To the moon!

I think you can hedge where you cash out some and hold some. A lot of times people talk about in full BTC still, but we could reach prices where just .5 BTC is just as much of a dollar investment which can easily mean you can with draw some while maintaining an investment. 
I think the biggest thing is your persona life scenarios. If that current money makes a huge difference or allows you to pay off a large some of debt (ex: high interest mortgage, credit card debt, or student loans) then pull it out, pay the prices, and don't let yourself feel bad if you miss out on money, you're still ahead.

I know you can write the loops, and because of that Ethereum seems to have quite a bit more applications and functional uses outside of just being a currency/store of value. Which is a positive for me.
Why does it's power make it so vulnerable? Is it inherently more vulnerable, or just because it can be leveraged so much you think it'll be attached more often.
At the very least, the speculation that any of these assumptions of value for any coin, alt or bit, are based on 100% sound logic is an incredibly naive interpretation in my opinion.

How do you even personally decide when something like an altcoin is overvalued and BTC is undervalued?

I remember the days where this would have been a tip of a full BTC

I'm glad I'm not the only one that responded this way....

I'm not 100% what this means, I'm not a developer or extremely well-versed in the technology side. 
What exactly does it mean to be a Turing complete language, and why is that bad?
By no technical restriction to the number of tokens, are you talking about the fact that there's no hard quantity, like the 21 million BTC limit?
The infrastructure being centralizes may have a benefit to a degree, IMO. BTC has been slow to adopt important changes from my perspective, and having things more centralized doesn't seem like an inherently bad quality across the board since changes can be made more swiftly. 
It just seems the argument to believe BTC has this entirely guaranteed inherent value, while arguing the opposite of other digital currents is very near sighted. To think that BTC should absolutely be worth substantially more than it is today is also hard to say with complete confidence. 
I'm a believer and hodlr, but also think sometimes people have a an over the top confidence for it without any acknowledgement of issues or downside. 
To systematically say it should be worth 1000x what it is now, seems just unfounded.
