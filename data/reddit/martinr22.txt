I am not sure I would trust myself to write one down, one mistake and all is lost.

I think the misrepresentation of the contract is the key. If you make changes then try to pass it back without informing the other party you modified it I don't think the contract is valid.

The same article is also posted in Not directly applicable but still amusing and anyone interested in money related topics would find it interesting.

I would not say that donations are useless,  these micro transactions are fractions of pennies, hopefully no one is making donations that small. Small amounts like $.50 should be fine. The divisibly is good for the future uncertainty, if the value of a bitcoin increased where there was a real value to smaller transactions then they could be used. It is not for sending very small amount of money.

to accept payment you could create an address for each customer when they place the order, then you can monitor that address to confirm payment. This way no one could claim someone else's payment as their own. 
Another options would be to require the data to be signed by the sender. The bitcoin-qt wallet lets you sign a message to ensure it came from the same person that sent the payment. not sure if this is in other wallets.

I agree here, I feel obligated to pay taxes because of the services my government provides. This doesn't mean I agree with 100% of the policies but this is not an excuse to not pay. 
I still believe living in a democracy is worth it, even if I often pay more taxes than I would like.

Usually casinos have max bet to prevent such a strategy. Doubling every loss quickly get up the to max and and some point you lose everything. What is the min/max here?

You can't destroy bitcoin, all you can do is destroy the private key which removes all possible access to them. Once the private key is gone you will still see the value attached to the public key. I don't there is anyway to prove if the private key is actually destroyed or not.

I feel it is not very safe to have more and more people, especially miners, not keeping whole blockchain but trusting others instead. The job of a miner should be to certify a block is valid, if they are doing the work to find the hashes but trusting others to verify the transactions it seems to weaken the security of the network. 
We should assume that people are trying to attack the network and that rogue clients exist that will try to propagate bad transactions. If more and more people blindly trust others then they could be contributing to solving blocks that could potentially contain bad transactions. Even if a bad block got included in the chain I am sure they would be caught fairly quickly however even small block forks could be very damaging to bitcoin's reputation. Just thinking the more trust vs. miners doing verification is happening the more likely such attacks would be possible. 
Perhaps I am being paranoid, I am mostly interest in bitcoin from an academic view. I am looking into it in detail to understand how it really works and how it is secure.

Contract work makes a lot of sense, it is doubtful my main employer will pay in bitcoin anytime soon. Perhaps looking for side work would be an option. I just like the idea of bitcoins that were directly earned, not bought with dollars.

Getting more retail (non-online) transactions would be a good step to get more widespread acceptance. Better, more secure mobile wallets would be key as well as ways to get quicker confirmations.

Another need is to be able to get paid in bitcoin. Otherwise when I get paid in dollars I need to go to exchange to get bitcoin to spend. Then I make more dollars and need to again go to an exchange to buy back more bitcoin. It seems like only the exchange wins if economy is split so much.

Who verifies transactions are valid? For instance if I make a transaction to send 100 BTC but I only have 10, then who is responsible for rejecting it? I thought it would be the miners who are bundling the transactions into blocks, but this would require having the blockchain to know my balance. Mining in a pool you definitely would not need as pool operator builds the blocks and you just search for nonce. However in mining I think someone needs full chain.

Why not send 0.00000001 somewhere with the rest as transaction fee, let someone get lucky and get them.

Interesting, I wad thinking the constant need for exchanges was a limitation but perhaps not.

P2Pool does seem like a good solution, do you know of a good pool using it?

Where are the funds going to come from where you will pay the interest? Are you also going to give bitcoin loans and charge interest? The advantage here is bitcoin would not allow any fractional reserve banking

This kind of proves the point that it is not as distributed as it seems. If everyone was solo mining only then the 0.8 block fork would done a lot more damage. The fact that just a few people working together were able to fix it means that there is some centralization of power.
