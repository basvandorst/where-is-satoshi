I kinda want it to briefly dip below 9k so I can get more views on my "over 9000" meme. Might as well make gains in at least one market. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:09:22
My point is that the more "responsible" move is to maintain faith in a system easily swayed by greed. I don't have anything in it I'm not willing to lose, plus, if I lost it all, it wouldn't smack the economy in the face for nearly the next ten years.

I love Bitcoin and I have to agree with you. People are blood thirsty for the death of fiscal and monetary policies, but I don't think a lot of people even understand the models created from Keynesian's philosophy. Classical economic theory doesn't help in times of recessions and depressions because the economy can function at equilibrium even if its GDP isn't near its potential. Aggregate demand has to be increased before firms start increasing their supply, which will put more people into jobs and more money in their pockets, which in turn increases aggregate demand even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:17:45
I am that guy. I already did that back at 12k. My bills are paid and I have more bitcoin. Sure, it's irresponsible, but not anymore irresponsible than how the banks tanked the economy a couple years ago.

It's important to note the difference between regular inflation and hyperinflation. I think that some people might have the idea that all currency, through regular inflation, eventually will be hyper-inflated, but that's not true.

Yeah, the hate crowd is pretty fucking dumb on this on. Had a guy say he was only on the subreddit to observe the "cultish" mentality. Lol like buddy, it's called a subreddit. Ya know, a place where people with similar opinions/interests congregate? Asked him for an example and he couldn't give me one.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:29:58
I didn't have any biases? Remember the part where I was like "I've been wondering what the whole BCash thing was"? Yeah, that means I didn't know anything about it. And obviously I'm going to research more, but now I have an idea of what to research.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:23
What, that most of us have similar opinions? Yeah, that's called a community, buddy. On Reddit, we call them subreddits.

I learned almost instantly to say away from day trading. Anytime you try to bet on there being a dip, Btc will immediately shoot up by 20% and never come back down.

Yea, you totally didn't say any of that in your comment now did ya? Corporations can hoard power and then take even more just like the government can, or have you not heard of Comcast?

Oh definitely dude. If anything, investing my extra money into Bitcoin has, at the least, taught me a habit of frugality. Whenever I think of buying something or eating out, I just think that the money would be more useful invested, so I've pretty much eliminated fast food from my diet. Over the past month and a half, I've only put in about 800 and have almost doubled it because of putting it in whenever I can. And don't even worry about the fees, you'll lose more if you wait the four business days for money to transfer into Gdax. The main thing is to just research the technology and the implications of a decentralized and global currency. I'll gladly give my money to support that.

Bitcoin is backed by memes. The danker the memes created, the more BTC increases in value. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:15:02
Also, it's better for the community if you only invest what you're not afraid to lose, that way we don't have a bunch of people panic selling and tomb-stoning every time someone dumps.

All systems created by humans are bubbles that hinge on social contracts, so it's not really a point of argument calling Bitcoin a bubble. What you need to ask are contextual questions. Compare Btc to other markets and what they looked like at this time frame. Compare Btc to other technologies that became pivotal to society.

No I mentioned Comcast because they're now so large and powerful that they can manipulate the legislative process of the government in order to benefit them at the expense of the people. And actually, yeah, I would prefer a bunch of smaller companies to compete because that's the actual benefit of capitalism? But I see you'd rather all the power and money sit in monopolies, giving them no threat nor incentive to increase productivity or lower prices. And if you hate socialism because it turns into communism, then you must hate capitalism because it turns into an oligarchy right?


Yeah, 'cause I totally trust corporations not to get greedy and fuck the entire country over.

The front page article on Bitcoin's energy consumption wasn't a "fuck Bitcoin" circlejerk this time. There are a lot of people asking for reference energy consumptions and wanting genuine information. So maybe that's a good sign?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:21:45
Haha well of course. I'm only 22 anyway, so my risk/reward is largely skewed into the net benefits region. Personally, investing dangerous amounts of money only hurts BTC because feel trigger happy and panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:11:17
Unless you wire funds, I believe it takes 4-5 business days for funds to transfer into gdax. That's a lot of time for BTC to do it's thang. I think that generally it's better to just pay the fees instead of risking prices taking off in the 1-2 weeks it takes for the funds to deliver.

It's important to note that what your describing is hyper-inflation, which is actually really rare. It's also important to note that monetary policy is not the direct cause of hyperinflation; financial crises following war and other economic disasters force governments to create money or otherwise disband entirely.

The cool thing about not investing more than you're willing to lose is how much pressure it takes off watching the fluctuations.

I'm 22 and I only make $9.10/hr, but I've invested $550 in the last two months and have already gained $60 from it. I believe that the technology has many different avenues of becoming globally legitimate and I'm also young, so I can afford to lose a couple hundred dollars I was probably going to waste on eating out or buying dumb shit.  Every time I think about buying something, I just think about all the bitcoin I can buy. So, even if I lose all my money, I'm learning important lessons in frugality.

I got in a couple days after the dip to 5k and bought in at $7500. I thought it was really dumb, but then we've almost immediately jumped up to 10k. The only sensible strategy here is to buy btc as soon as you have the money to.

BUT, the flaw in this is that I takes a couple days to deposit funds into your account, whereas buying with card is instant. Usually with Bitcoin, a couple of days will result in a substantial increase in price/BTC. Sure, you have to pay a fee, but that fee is usually eaten up immediately. If you're only able to invest relatively small amounts at a time, it's more beneficial to just pay the fee and get your foot in the door immediately. If you plan on day trading though,

If you're absolutely dedicated to Bitcoin, you could do what businesses do and take out a loan to invest. As long as your profits are a higher percentage than your interest rate, you'll be fine. I wouldn't necessarily advice it, but the option is always open��
