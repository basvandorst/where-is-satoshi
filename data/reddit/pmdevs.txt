Happy new year's, nice to see you ate your Wheaties this morning ��

Looks like all the jobs have expired.

I thought they were priced to gdax, kraken, itbit, and bitstamp?

Thanks Stannis

To my understanding "we" are working on those things (we meaning the community at large, and developers in specific) by lobbying for segwit adoption, and working on the lightning network. What else do you propose we do?

I mostly agree with you, but I did move from Coinbase/Gdax to Gemini, due both to their mishandling of bch (or really just offering bch at all), and they seem to have some major scaling/network issues.

I'm hopeful that futures trading will actually bring an amount of volume and stability to it that will allow it be more of a currency. Currently, no one wants to buy the next "million dollar pizza", by spending btc anywhere, but if it stabilizes and shows constant, but slow, growth, people can use it as a currency more effectively.

Ahhhhhh, off by 100 error, thank you

What do you recommend?

He's full of shit

With Electrum you can use segwit or non-segwit, I like it so far.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:43:18
I thought that was estimated to be 2040?

Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out! ✌

Which one's opening today? And what is it's price indexed to? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:16:56
So it could go down, or come back up? Incredible analysis, thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:28
Yeah I'm sure that's legit.

It may seem like nothing is happening, but trust me, many people are working on implementing Ln. And that's a good thing. Writing robust software architecture that does it's job without bugs takes a really long time, and is always worth it. Btc is not going to get replaced (at least not any time soon), believe me it's not going anywhere.
There are definitely ways you can help as well, even if you're not a developer. The most direct way is to donate to bitcoin.org, or you could host a node, or email your favorite exchange and urge them to adopt segwit, if they aren't already. Here's a helpful link that lists a bunch of ways to help out:

Good point, thanks for the tip! I'll wait until January and see what the mempool looks like.

Sorry you sold all your coins, I would be kicking myself too. Thing is, a lot of us are invested in the technology, and the promise of btc. Hodling isn't just to make a lot of money some day, it's committing to a new way of dealing with money.

I've been waiting for about three weeks now. Not a day trader, so not a huge deal, but it would be nice to have my account verified.

I was waiting for a dip for so long, just said fuck it and bought yesterday,happy today!
