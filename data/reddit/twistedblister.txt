"How we can best take advantage of it"
Meaning "How can we find a way to double-dip on fees like we do with eBay/PayPal and continue raping the consumers".
Fuck eRape and RapePal. 
I was an active buyer and seller for over a decade, but no more. They no longer care about protecting sellers. And they'd be much happier if everyone only sold new same-as-everyone-else merchandise, and that people that deal in collectibles and antiques or any other unique items went somewhere else.  eBay actually used to be *fun*, regardless whether you were buying or selling. 
I switched to buying on amazon nowadays, and if there's any collectibles I want to buy or sell, there's plenty of Facebook pages, web forums or even Craigslist for whatever thing that anyone might be into.
The day that eBay closes it's doors will be a day of rejoicing for me. YES, I know that's probably not going to happen. Ever. But I'll keep wishing and hoping that they'll go into dinosaur mode, and the rest of the world will pass them by. I love Bitcoin just because it nips at the heels of PayPal too.

I'm not talking about people who don't understand tech. I have some coworkers that are engineers and are very tech savvy. They said they don't want to buy Bitcoin because it's too expensive. They had no idea that Bitcoin is divisible and you don't need $400 to buy some, you can buy as little a few cents worth. What can the Bitcoin community do to educate the public that 1 Bitcoin is divisible?
I can buy a few cents worth? I've been interested in bitcoin, but I'm a broke-ass guy, so how do I go about buy $20 worth of bitcoin?

Kind of reminds me about Blockbuster Videos decision to not go into the digital download business a few years ago... I'd love to see RapePal...... er, PayPal go under.

Okay, explain it like I'm five.
