Thanks! I was really nervous at first, and it showed. But once I think I started talking more, I found a better rhythm. Practice makes perfect.

I really like the [khan academy series on bitcoin]( and usually recommend that. I haven't tried the freakonomics podcast yet, but now I will!

This is the same publisher as the first version before it was banned (by the creator of Blockchain.info). We are working on changing titles to make it more clear that this app is created by blockchain.info

It was in the front of my mind to say away from continuously saying 'um', but 'basically' swooped into its place. I'll get it the next time! Thanks for your feedback.

During the video, when you see that guy walk right infront of the camera and sit down, that's my dad, haha.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will start working on a fix and deploy as soon as possible.
EDIT: This issue has been fixed and will be reflected in the next update :]

I'm sure, if the response is well-received enough, Barry (the moderator and vp) will want to have another talk similar to this one. Probably one that allows more time for questions from the audience, and maybe good questions from twitter or something. I'll pass this along! Glad you liked it!

My parents are super supportive and impressed in what I do. If I were to puke all over the stage, I'm sure they wouldn't think any less of me. Glad I didn't have to find out tho, haha.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:12:42
That's a great idea. So if I blank, I can just recite a go-to explanation point. It's a lot of fun fielding these questions in a format like this. Hopefully I'll see you one day on C-SPAN! You never know.

Hey, sorry that your attempts didn't get through. We are close to having a better option for people to add new places. If you give me the information here (or through PM), I'll go ahead and add it into the database:
Name, address, city, zip, phone (with international prefix), and a short description (1-2 sentences).
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:01:45
Well, the only direction to go now is up! Now I have a sense on what to do / what not to do, and hopefully I'll be able to make a more coherent explanation next time.  
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:43:57
Haha, as soon as I said it. I was waiting to see if someone was going to correct me, or if it came up again I'd fix it, but I never saw a good opportunity. I told people who suck around after that I messed that up. Good catch.

I have to give credit where credit is due, I got that analogy from watching an Andreas video. Also, in-between then and now, I've been told that I can use email to demonstrate public &amp; private key. i.e. your public key is like your email, you can give this to anyone so they can send you btc. And your password for that email is like your private key.

Oh, we talked for about 4-5 minutes when we were waiting for this to start. I was worried initially when he introduced himself, but he told me right away that he was pro-bitcoin (a HUGE sigh of relief). We touched on some topics, but didn't get as in-depth as we did on camera.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:03:47
Practice makes perfect. It was my first time on camera, and I think it showed. Now I know where I need to work on, and this feedback does help. Hopefully whatever talk I'm in next time, we'll see an improvement :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:00:47
Thank you for your reply. I WILL use some of these examples you've provided next time I get the chance. After this experience, I'm going to practice some of these key speaking topics, so I might (will) message you in the future to get your input. Really, thanks.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:52:59
Thank you for your comment. I did learn a lot from this experience. I know I can and will do better.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:27:05
Thanks! YOU rock!
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:41:21
Yes, you can submit a ticket to blockchain.zendesk.com, and we'll give it to the iPhone dev team.

We are not using BIP 70 for your payment links at the moment. That functionality will be implemented soon. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:59:42
Thank you for pointing this out. This will be fixed in the next update.

This usually happens when we receive a high number of API requests from a single IP address that isn't using an API key (in order to prevent a potential DDoS). I'm sorry for the inconvenience. If you PM me the IP, I'll go ahead and unban it with cloudflare. 
In the future, if you open a ticket with blockchain.zendesk.com, and ask for Kevin in the beginning, you'll be assigned to me and I'll help you out.
Humble apologies.

Ha, I knew it was only a matter of time before the video made it here. You're absolutely right. I was really excited, a little nervous, and I guess that excitement made me move at a different pace than I should of. I'm learning on how to convey this information more effectively, and this response is really helpful. Thank you.

Unfortunately, this VPN IP did trigger a limit we have in place, over 725 requests in 5 minutes. Every one of our user wallets technically just use APIs, that's how we keep the security/anonymity of our users.
And sorry it wasn't clear, opening a ticket at blockchain via the support pages will 100% get a response from us.
