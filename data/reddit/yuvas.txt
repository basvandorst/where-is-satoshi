I don’t know who worships this new monotheistic crypto garbage religion.    
From  One god —-&gt;one megabyte.    
From church —-&gt;block-stream .    
From monotheism—-&gt; monotheism (same)
The  block-stream followers are so monoEverything  i wont be surprised if they use only one side of their brain .��
You have the face to talk about evolution the last time i ve checked bitcoin still use the same block size... pure stagnation 
Personally i don’t worship satoshi he is human he proposed a realistic very simple way to evolve bitcoin capacity ...its not the first  time bitcoin rise
The block size to cope with the demand.
So what’s the problem?
The only problem is these outsourced (axa) hijacker so called 
Blockstream to handicap Bitcoin.
Thats why BitcoinCash Ethereum and all the rest need to exist as a response to this new church .you can control bitcoin with censorship and paid trolls with axa money,  but you can not control evolution...

I was talking about bitcoin not the pegged segwitcoin
Bitcoin remain same no rise in block size. There is talk right now inside Block-stream to decrease the block size ...
