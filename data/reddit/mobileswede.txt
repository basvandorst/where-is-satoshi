Dangerous how? Can you please give me a link to this research. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:25:12
Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:42:47
What? Segwit is a very complicated solution to a simple problem. Simply increasing the blocksize is a more straightforward solution. You don't have to agree with my opinion, but you can clearly see there are reasons to prefer one over the other. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:47:25
The mempool would not be as full. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:24:30
Even if the blocks are filled, don't you think the lower fees would be a good thing? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:57:21
From the picture, it looks like a BTC is being replaced by LTC. Is that a good thing? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:48:37


@_date: 2018-01-03 18:47:40
So you mean both BTC and BCH are shitcoins? Why are you even here? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:07:55
You should do the math on 2mb blocks again. How are you counting? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:49:15


@_date: 2017-12-15 20:31:27
No such thing, really. It's mostly talking heads.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:18
Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:08:13
Signed ready-pruned images of the blockchain from a trusted source? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:55:50
But if BTC had 8MB blocks, they wouldn't be full and the fees would be optional. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:18:48
Did I say it did?

Uber will buy 20 000 self-driving Volvos...
How do taxi companies work where you are? Taxi companies in Sweden are layered. The company that advertises and operates the phone number / websites seldom owns any cars. They sell bookings to another company that dispatches the cars. That company might own cars and employ drivers, but the drivers can also be independent contractors. They might own their cars, but they could also be leasing them. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:30:34
You are right, but that's not what I meant. When the Lightning network is available, how can I use to send $30 to a buddy? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:04:05
What's that? I'm not in the US. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:29:35
Where can I actually buy stuff with LTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:00:00
If BCH is a scam, how does the scam work? What is the game? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:52:32


BCH blocks can be up to 8MB. The current number of transactions on the BTC chain would not fill the blocks of the BCH chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:50:00
The typical LBC trader will use their escrow services. No need to make BTC transactions for every trade, only to top up your LBC balance. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:41:41
BCH had six independent development teams last I checked... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:29:55
But the BTC chain is not working right now. You can't blame BCH for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:48:41
So you see no value in testing out very large blocks? Or are you just sad to see how feasible very large blocks are? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:28:48
BCH also has 0-conf, and a faster difficulty adjustment mechanism. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:31:17
I saw that story as well. IIRC it was not a post of its own, but the most up voted comment on someone else's picture of a paperwallet they gave for Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:53
Do you mean there is a gap between the adoption level from a couple of years ago, and the adoption level we expect in a couple of years - a gap where bitcoin must not be a usable currency? Two years ago bitcoin worked fine as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:51
So will I be able to use bitcoin to send $100 to a buddy or pay for my lunch with LN? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:14:03
Yeah, people who happen to get bitcoin cash will actually be able to use it as a currency and pay for everyday purchases. What a ruse! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:41:50
The miners are doing what they always do, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:50:44
It's also very symptomatic. A lot of vendors are dropping support. Bitcoin has become a lot less useful as a currency, which I think is sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:54:00
This marks a very sad time in Bitcoin history. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:08:44
Ok, sounds cool. No fees? I bet they have a hefty TOS.
Bank transfers between personal accounts are free within Sweden. If you use the Swish app they are also instant, otherwise it can take a banking day.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:00:01
So tell me again why we must have a non-functional BTC right now when the solution is well known? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:30:21
It would be great if exchanges let you do a SEPA or wire transfer directly between them, but they don't want you to to that for some reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:57:28
Again, how is this a scam? I don't buy into the covert asicboost tale, but even if it WAS true, it's an unfair advantage - not a scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:39:50
What kind of sweet deals did we get? Are you talking about the government subsidy? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:05:01
If you show the whole scale up to 100% it's even clearer. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:02:55
This would be gentlemen. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:46:10
In Sweden there's a tax incentive. Capital gains on BTC are taxed at 30%, but a BTC certificate can be held in a special investment savings account that is taxed ca 0.5% per year regardless if gains or losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:06:15
Funny how my Rpi can handle 8MB blocks just fine on the BCH chain then... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:54:38
So I will send him $30 not from my wallet to his, but from my Lightning Service Provider account to his? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:55:46
0 conf allows things like bitcoin sending machines and overall less need for confirmations. Faster difficulty adjustment gives a smoother rate of blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:34:10
And therefore we must have a non-functional bitcoin now? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:23:38
Was there ever a question to it? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:32:06

This story is a lie. You guys can try out bitcoin.com s wallet for yourself to verify. The described scenario can't happen. They BTC is available in the BTC wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:56:45
The guy I originally replied to thought otherwise, but you are obviously not him. My bad.
The point of arguing is to come to a *new* conclusion and do a HF to bigger blocks, supported by core. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:07:08
Ever heard of gigablocks?

It's still a subreddit for BTC, but also for BCH. BCH was not around when the sub was created. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:31:51
How? I want to send $30 to a buddy for whatever reasons. How can I use the lightning network? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:05:02
They've been around several years. The world is bigger than your closest circle of friends. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:04:17
Not in at least a couple of years (more likely a couple of decades). We could easily go with 8MB blocks right now, as has been done with BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:13:35
On chain scaling is *working* RIGHT NOW. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:23
That's 100 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:58
Would you care to explain a bit further? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:07:50
Impressive. Too bad Denmark is so poor at Ice Hockey ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:34:27
So I should still use BCH for that? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:21:27
How? If you send BTC to a Segwit address, that's OK. If you send BCH to a Segwit address it is not a Segwit address since there is no Segwit on the BCH chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:36:52
I thought Segwit was the first step and Lightning is step two? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:38:19
Well, I don't agree. More importantly, this sub does not allow a free discussion. But this is not the place for this discussion. Let's agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:29:29
The opposite could certainly be said about this sub. There's some truth in it, but I still read both.

Is there a place I could buy a Rolex for BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:06

@_date: 2017-02-24 20:05:45
That usually helps. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:21:28
Why not just use bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:09:10
Shouldn't this question have it's own thread? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:07:34
That's essentially off-chain payments? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 13:43:14
But why? 
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:08:55
Ahh, thanks. That seems like so long ago. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:46:47
How so? You have to spend a little more to be able to run a full node? $50 more for a bigger hard drive? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:00:29
$15k would be enough for me to retire.
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:59:00
So you don't care about the exchange rate? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:47:49
The basic misunderstanding here is that while the number of bitcoins that will ever be issued is finite, each bitcoin can be split into an **infinite** amount of small parts. Therefore, the supply of bitcoin parts is infinite.
@_date: 2017-02-20 09:45:47
What's bad with supporting Unlimited? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:13:19

Can I use this as a Swede? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:29:04
How do you know? BU getting 50%+ might also get a lot of miners to switch sides very quickly. 50% can grow to 75% in a couple of days or weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:32:43


When and where did "they" say that? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:17:29
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:33:06
Why get a Pi zero instead if a Pi 3? That kit you bought cost more than a Pi 3.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:19:02
A couple of weeks after a 75% fork, the losing side will not be around anymore. It will most likely be over in a few hours.  Miners mining on the main chain will sell their coins on exchanges and through other channels like they always have. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:34:03
Where? When? Some examples, please. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:05:31

I think the German society is pretty much as sound as the Swedish.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:11:14
At what exchange rate does that happen? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:28:39
That list says they will support Segwit. It says nothing about core or unlimited.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:24:21


Woot? In Sweden, the tax is 30% on gains. It doesn't matter if it's normal currency, stocks, gold, bank interest or bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:32:18

You should ask the exchanges what they plan to do. They can decide whatever they want. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:13:43
You can buy into the ETF from most trading and investment platforms. When people do so, the ETF management will buy bitcoin. This will make the price go to Mars. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:37:22
Who's tried any of these? Are they any good? Any drawbacks compared to imgur? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:43:30


I would not count on that. If BU reaches 50%+, things are going to happen fast. At 75%, a fork is very likely, no matter what the exchanges say. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:03:09
You can't replay transactions on a non-existant chain. Exchanges will list the only chain left.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:31:03
They will keep jumping around since 144 blocks is too few to see significant changes. Five or even fifteen percent swings are expected due to normal variance. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:43:02
If the big investors trust an exchange with billions of dollars, so can you.
@_date: 2016-06-27 09:54:48


Yeah, just use the force to make the price go down... How do you do that?
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:40:00
Obviously. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:20:34

What? The QT client hasn't always used wallet encryption. On an old enough version (keep in mind these coins were seized a couple of years ago), the private keys are available in plain text in a file. But there's no need even for that if you have the computer. Just start it up and make a transaction.
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:54:24
Maybe he just had a wallet in a computer, and the computer was seized? Could also have been a phone.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:37:21
Would you care to expand on that? What's a *consolidation flag*? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:32:18
The first paragraph is a quote by Jakobsen. The second is a statement by the reporter who wrote the article.
@_date: 2016-06-04 05:27:16
Ok. I think it looks more like a consolidation *pennant*, using the lingo from that page and looking back a few days.

Bitcoin is magic. If you were gambling, I'd say that's a very destructive strategy. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:30:25
Yes, but they can only pay to bank accounts. That's not how you normally pay a bill in Sweden.
@_date: 2016-06-04 05:23:10

The most likely outcome is that you end up with less BTC than you started with. Think about it for a few minutes and you will understand why.

Mining has been more and more decentralized over the last years. How can you say it's centralized?

I know who he is, but I think I have a vastly different opinion of him than you do.

Did BU die? When? How?
I don't think BU is out of the picture. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:27:14
Why do you check Kraken prices? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:15:43
That depends a whole lot on where you live. In Sweden most of our electricity comes from hydro and nuclear plants. France is mostly nuclear. Poland is mostly coal.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:06:59
Yeah that just can't be. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:00:58
Then point out the lie. Possibly call them a *liar*.

When did Roger say he ha s dumped most of if his BTC for alts? As far as I have read, he says he still has most of his BTC and has only put like 5% into alts. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:02:47
That's just not true. If Jihan controlled 60% of the hash rate, we would all be running Bitcoin Unlimited now.
The truth is there are now a plethora of independent pools, more than there has ever been before. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:57:20
What's with the tone? Why call someone an idiot? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:09:13
Too bad you didn't have a sell order up.

Signed by Bitcoin.com? Why would Roger Ver agree to this?

BU is IN production right now. What on earth are you going on about? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:58:58
I take it you agree it's unrevocable? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:56:02
If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done.
It could be it's just a small fraction of Coinbase users that are very vocal.

What? Sure you can create money out of nothing. Both BTC and fiat money are fine examples.

Is that what we're calling Bitstamp now, just Stamp? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:57:51
Most definitely the ones you see in the streets, dressed in black and looting.

Since we are using yank dollars, shouldn't we also use yank units, like inches or something?

He probably means the price is 0.025 BTC, not 0.02798124.
@_date: 2016-07-05 11:59:27


Quite remarkable! 
How long has there been at least one miner online and accepting transactions? Was there a period in the very beginning when Satoshi was the single miner and he had to turn his computer off?
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:15:00
That kind of transactions have been handled on chain before. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:55:36
When someone else finds a block, your mining work put into mining that 'same' block is nullified. Therefore, less competition makes mining more profitable.
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:03:51
I thought the point was to make it full auto. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 15:51:35
That's not a realistic alternative. I can't buy a mining rig for $600 and use it to instantly mine one BTC. It's more like I could buy a $10 000 rig and mine 20 BTC over one year before the rig costs more to run than it makes.
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:23:58
That's the 10 000 BTC question, isn't it? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:52:08
Is there a good round-up of cards available in Europe?
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:51:22
In that case, use your local or your suppliers currency as base and implement some sort of nice rounding on the BTC price.
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:54:09
I'm not so sure it's a good idea. Anyway, you want BTC to be your base currency. Make the devs implement such a possibility. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:17:04
Is it normal to pay witnesses I the US? It sounds shady to me. I can understand covering expenses, but paying for their 'service' is odd. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 15:47:12
Professionalism is not a bad thing, but centralization is. The former brings the latter.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:35:57
Not everyone is rational. And I think the 'buy bitcoin instead' argument is valid for all mining.
@_date: 2016-07-10 08:12:37
Could be a number of reasons, but here's my take: Mining is now thoroughly dominated by large, commercial actors. They were very profitable before the halvening, and they are still profitable. Any struggling small scale operations that are now inprofitable are too small to notice if they shut down. Also, for at least a few months, improfitable miners will keep going in hopes that the exchange rate will go up and save them.
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:56:27
When was this? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:33:30
Another solution is for the exchange to implement different ways to make a 'payment' (to someone other than the account owner, thus the fee is taken from balance) and a 'withdrawal' (to the account owner).
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:12:12
Why? It's been done before.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:03:26
You don't know much about making chips do you?
Assembling the board is another story, but the equipment needed is negligible compared to a chip factory.

Decentralization is good in itself.

If you can get paid something for the POW calculations, they get cheaper.

Can we have a link to your store? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:53:53
I've made ten withdrawals over the last two weeks. They all went through right away no problem. Now if I could only get that level 2 verification so I could do one big withdrawal instead of ten small ones... 
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:56:17
As a home miner, is mining still profitable for you? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:43:29
I registered with Poloniex a couple of weeks ago and has since made two withdrawals, both for 0.7 BTC. Both went through without a hitch. Did you click the confirmation link in the email? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:32:16
Don't AMD do their own GPU chips today? The same factory could make other chips.
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:06:00
I meant the former, but the latter might work too. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 15:53:35
So you are keeping it running in hopes the exchange rate will increase? 
@_date: 2016-07-08 08:34:18
What are you selling? BTC?
If you are selling something that has a price that is more stable in another currency, you should use that currency as your base currency. Base pricing in BTC will lead to very unstable prices, as the BTC exchange rate is. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:31:45
Has there been any official response from Bitstamp yet?
