Send a letter, like envelope and stamp, not email, to the corporate offices. The fact that they gave you conflicting information (which, by definition, someone is lying to you) is bad enough, but the whole experience sounds bad. I would bet they compensate you.

For anyone interested in sources, the email address in question is on page 14 of [this pdf.]( and the instructions that say to send an email to that address are on [this page.](
 Go forth and comment and sorry for my crappy infographic, but I'm heated about this.

Wait - what? We're saying the bank that admitted to abetting a genocide and other war crimes was extorted and didn't get just and fair treatment because they CHOSE - their own decision - NOT to go to trial and instead to settle out of court. 
Which the article equates to extortion because trial meant they might lose their US banking license. 
I mean, from where I'm sitting 20bn is a bargain for a bank to get away with laundering war crime money when caught red handed and Lawsky's error was that he even let them settle - I'd have preferred they be barred from the US for being what I can only describe as demonstrably evil. 
I realize that everyone here is a little hot on Lawsky because his bitlicense framework is an overreaching dystopian nightmare but rather than post critical articles of the guy go submit public comment on that goddamn framework in the hopes that they pare the thing down to a mere regulation of fiat-btc transactions. Sheesh.

Simply put - thank you.

Because the laws affect any company or person wishing to do business with a NY resident. It's far too overreaching as is and as a result, nevada based BTCguild says they'll shut down if these come into effect. They effect us all - comment.

I hope you comment, and include that in your message: as the proposed rules erroneously note that they will have "No impact on NY jobs" and you are a clear example why not.
