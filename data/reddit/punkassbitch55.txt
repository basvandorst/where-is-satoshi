Yes this is true, ive actually found a chart on the internet that shows this. If you look , there is a line, this shows the price. I have found it does move around quite a lot

not really, but its a consideration, especially given that the nature of what bitcoin aims to replace and the current volatility of global events
Do we want to invest time in a money-protocol thats able to withstand all scenarios, or just hope that nothing catastrophic could happen and go with bigger blocks?

Also the Y axis isnt labelled. Are you referencing moon?

Did the opposite and sold 1200 etc for bitcoin a few days ago. also 1,000 etc. It felt really good
might get back in if we see $7
I think ethereum might have a lull for 12-24 months, nothing is happing in the space of any excitement

One of the issues I see with big blocks and referenced the said laws, is that in a devastating global black swan event, networks could go down and bring the protocol to a standstill. The network must be robust enough to function over slower speeds.
