The thing is, though, everything starts with the leader. Google wouldn't be the innovation powerhouse that it is if that isn't what Page and Brine set out to establish. There are a lot of very subtle characteristics instilled by the CEO of a company that does as well as those companies do. Once you as an employee are able to demand around a six figure salary, cultural fit with the organization is what brings you on board. All things held equal, the innovative people go with the innovative company, and that starts at the CEO.
I suppose the argument I'd like to make is that the nature of Apple is changing. They're changing from the cool, innovative kid on the block to a lumbering tech incumbent. As long as you invest appropriately, you're fine, I just wouldn't expect much innovation from them.

That's what I find weird. Why would any company offer a costly service like the backend behind credit cards without charging for it?

I would disagree a bit. The biggest issue right now is that there is no trust in the system. We can solve security easily enough by setting up a sort of bitcoin bank that ensures the coin security and provides a debit card type thing that can be cancelled if lost or stolen.
The problem is that nobody would trust that bank for a long while, long enough to make it very difficult to secure funding.

I'm sorry, I'm a bit fuzzy on derivatives, so I'm not sure about the implications here.
Derivatives gain their value from the asset they're derived from, which to me implies that the management of that derivative are bought into that asset with the entirety of the capitalization of the derivative. 
Given that, it seems like this news story is saying that exposure to bitcoin is going to be accessible to investors in this exchange through the derivative. 
Is that correct? And how does this derivative differ from the Winklevoss ETF? That ETF has been my personal moon rocket for a while now.

Hey Jordan, fellow young entrepreneur here. My companies haven't gotten as big and successful as Robocoin, but I have learned a few lessons along the way.
One of those lessons is that customers have a point of no return, where there is nothing you can do to fix things. Legal threats are a clear sign of this, though that line is usually crossed much sooner. It sucks, since (I'll assume) you want to satisfy all your customers, but sometimes that just isn't possible.
Once that point of no return is crossed, the cost of placating the customer starts ticking upward. I like to offer immediate full refunds at this point, but if you delay, the customer gets more and more angry and more difficult to get rid of.
Hopefully you can learn from this experience. Customers are the best thing in the world right up until they turn on you. Then, they are your worst enemies. As painful as this is, it's always easier to deal with angry customers immediately and completely by making them whole as soon as possible. This sale was lost long ago, and now you're losing many more by letting this drag on.

I've seen the ETF as a moon rocket primarily because it allows everyday investors exposure to bitcoin. At this point, as a small time investor, the one thing you may know about it is that the risk/reward ratio is far better than what you see out of typical assets, so I see the capitalization of BTC going bananas. With further capitalization comes further demand, which drives demand. At the same time, supply is constrained by the lag time between obtaining new mining equipment and increasing the hash rate, so I would imagine a spike in price from the ETF that would level off after a couple of months.
As far as the rest of it, it's still up in the air. I have been involved with bitcoin for about three years now and I trust nobody when it comes to buying and selling. I've seen too much shenanigans, and nobody seems incentivized to actually stay true to their users. 
When I got in, Mt. Gox was above reproach, and where are they now? I bought a Jalapeno when they first came out. I've been burned too hard and for too long, I'll put my faith in the system when it has legitimacy, which, as much as I like BTC, it simply doesn't have at this point.

It might be worth it to actually start an llc.
In Maryland at least, it costs $275 IIRC, and you can designate it to do anything, so you're not limited. You get a liability shield for that fee, so any debt that llc incurs doesn't transfer to you personally.
At the same time, it makes you look more stable to the bank, so you can get a better credit card offer. If you have M&amp;T in your region, they used to offer a bundle deal, not sure if they still do. You sign up for a load of stuff and get reimbursed pretty much all fees.
I actually started a business, which is why I went through all this, but in MD, it cost about $275 and a few hours of dealing with paperwork to get personal savings and checking, and business savings, checking, credit and safety deposit without any fees whatsoever.
My business was a terrible flop, but I still have all this great bank shit, so that's something.

That money would have been paid out to increase supply of dollars in foreign markets and drive down interest rates for dollar based loans in those countries. The effect is that foreign businesses that hold their wealth in the foreign currency are now more wealthy compared to if they had kept money in the dollar. As exchange rates fluctuate, this incentivizes foreign businesses to hold more dollars and export more to the US. The supply of these new goods flowing to the US then drives down prices in the US and provides US consumers with wider access to goods at the same time. In addition, lower dollar-based interest rates in foreign countries will incentivize new start-ups and expansions in the foreign country, allowing US/dollar-based companies to gain a foothold in those countries on the cheap.
I'm pretty sure that was the intent behind those swaps. Did it create more economic benefit for the US than the $500 bn cost? There's no way to tell, with the way everything fell apart almost immediately after. Did this play a part in the recession? Maybe. It certainly would have hindered the recovery effort. Would this have been an issue in a market that didn't crash? I doubt it, personally.

You shouldn't take advice from random kids on Reddit.
That said, the best investment advice I've ever heard is "The fastest horse wins the race". That means that if you are in an investment that's been beaten down and may take a while to regain some momentum, it might be better to sell and get into an investment with more upward potential than to stay in the investment.
I think Bitcoin will be heading up, but, as I'm sure you know by now, it's extremely volatile, so you never really know. We could all lose everything tomorrow, or be rich as kings.

Well that depends on your standard of living and where you expect BTC to go.
Let's say you want to maintain a $60k standard of living, and that you have 50 years of life left in you. Let's also assume an inflation rate of 3% and an average stock market interest rate of 5%. Those should be pretty conservative. That comes out to about $2 million. 
I saw an estimate somewhere above that looked at the Cyprus bubble and made a forecast based on the same thing happening in China. That estimate puts the price of BTC at $718,000, so we'll say that 4 Bitcoins will cover your $2 million nicely.
So if you want to retire today, I would recommend buying 4 Bitcoins for just under a thousand bucks. As your financial adviser, your bill will arrive by mail shortly.

Shares are split strategically. Most people aren't going to buy really high dollar stocks because they're just too expensive to have in your portfolio, so most companies split their stocks to keep them under $100. 
Besides, a split doesn't dilute the value of the stock, just the price. Price drops the exact amount of a split, so you have the same amount of money after the split as before.
There's no real reason to split BTC anyway. We'll just come up with names for denominations. Right now it's whole coins and internets, in the future it might be Satoshi's or something else, depending on the most common denomination

There has been bad news, the shutdown of the Silk Road. 
There were many people that thought the shutdown would destroy the value of BTC, but it hasn't really done anything. There was a small drop that day, but price has rebounded very quickly and reached a point we haven't seen since the bubble earlier this year.
I would interpret that as Bitcoin having strong intrinsic value or value as a currency that can be widely used. Either way, the lack of reaction to what should have been a major blow to BTC is a good sign, in my opinion.

That's AsicMiner. 
They're a company that exists solely to mine BTC. They built their own ASICs from scratch, if I heard correctly, and they just use them for their own use. They only sell their machines when they're phasing into a new bunch of machines. 
They're basically operating like a publicly traded company. You can buy stock from them and they'll pay out a portion of what they mine based on how much stock you have, though it's nowhere near what you could get mining on your own.

PWM also stands for pulse-width modulatOR, which is the part in the VRM that actually corrects the voltage, so the PWM is part of the VRM. The VRM is semi-digital, yes, where the PWM is analog and the rest of the VRM is digital. The PWM is the part that actually benefits from being digital, but that makes them quite a bit more expensive.

IMHO what has to happen is that the government has to ignore it for a long time, or at least do nothing for a long time. 
Without government intervention, I don't really see much of an end in sight. I think the Winklevoss whatever-it's-called is going to be huge for BTC, as it will open up BTC for easy trades. It might be volatile, but it's pretty easy to hedge against that volatility with standard portfolio theory, and given the historical prices of BTC, it looks pretty good for a crazy volatile security.
My prediction is that once the Winklevoss thing goes up, shit loads of people will buy very small amounts, driving the price crazy. This attracts another big spike in attention from the market as it goes up, and another when price drops off a cliff two weeks in. From there, we'll have decently wide awareness, and we'll see a steady growth with massive bubbles every few months. After a certain amount of time, price would probably be insulated against bubbles though, since we tend to recover very quickly.

With Mt. Gox being as big of an exchange as it is, and with Bitcoin being as illiquid as it is, we have one point that handles far too many transactions right now.
What we need at this point is decentralized exchange. Decentralized currency is all well and good, but if it all has to funnel through a single point anyway, then what's the point? You get the kind of nonsense that we've been dealing with since yesterday.
Personally, I just want Amazon to accept BTC. That would add a huge amount of liquidity to BTC, which would in turn add to stability. I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, given the volatility of BTC, but it'd sure be nice.

Difficulty probably won't drop with price since difficulty is tied to the total hash rate. The only time difficulty would drop is when paying for electricity is more expensive than what the mining brings in, which is unlikely to happen any time soon with ASICs.

If you get your gasoline straight from the pump, it may be up to 20% ethanol. They do that to save money, but it doesn't work as well. Try to get some ethanol free fuel, that should bump up your performance significantly

About $1 per day at my hash rate lol

801 BTC price for 10k chips
801 BTC * $150 = $120,150 for the lot
$120,150 / 10,000 = $12 per chip
5,000 Mh/s / 283 Mh/s = 17.6 chips necessary to equal the power of a Jalapeno
$12 * 17.6 = $212
I mainly just typed this out because I thought I had my math wrong at first, but it looks like a Jalapeno is only $60 more for the same power. Given that this only gives you a pile of chips, BFL seems like a much better choice

The reason you can pay just by signing somewhere is because companies like Visa and PayPal do all the heavy lifting for you. They pay for you really quickly, then either collect a check from you at the end of the month on a credit card, or transfer money out of your account over a few days on a debit card.

It's not quite what you're looking for, but if you're interested in math, but are pretty novice at it, [Numberphile is a very interesting YouTube channel dedicated to numbers and math.](
The video in the link is a short discussion about whether numbers exist or not. It's stuff you probably already know if you have a degree in math or something, but for those of us with only a high school level of math, I find it pretty interesting.

I would imagine that when you spend them, you are essentially realizing the gain on any BTC that you spend, so you would then have to pay capital gains on the amount that you spent.
At least, that's the argument I would make if I were the IRS. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:25:48
When you are asking why somebody is doing something, it is almost always because it is more profitable for them than the alternative.
Or they're an idiot.
If you want to feel nice and fuzzy, you create profit by creating value for others and skimming a bit off the top, like most legal business. If you don't give a fuck about anybody, you'll be fine with creating profit by taking value from others.
Unless you're just an idiot, then all bets are off.

[The new currency budget for the dollar is $747 million](
That's just for printing new dollars and minting new coins. It doesn't at all take into account the power being used to process all of the VISA transactions, which surely outnumber Bitcoin transactions at least 1000:1
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:55:57
The guy on the left started with saying that BTC is just for criminals and scumbags, then ends up agreeing that it has it's place and can be a useful thing.
Blew my mind. It seems like nobody is interested in reporting a fair story anymore, they just want to force their (or the network's)opinion down our throats.
I was expecting the conversation to turn to "The government has to shut this down as soon as possible because criminals use it, and criminals are bad". I was expecting the same stupid shit we seem to hear every day, so while it wasn't an ideal conversation, it was certainly better than I was expecting
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:23:59
1 to 1, oddly enough. In the future, all work is coordinated by the government and is required to be 22 hours per day, so companies selling extra lunch time to employees is really the only profitable business left on the planet.

Contributing to the success of bitcoin has nothing to do with it's value as an investment. If that's your goal, then sure, grab one, though I wouldn't recommend buying an FPGA at this point. 
Besides, you're still investing in an extremely volatile market and not seeing a return on it until next February.
By next February, you could make 16% return (based on these very conservative numbers, imo). The BTC I'm holding made that return this week already. 
So buying this machine exposes you to the volatility of the market while still taking forever to make a profit, while difficulty is definitely going to skyrocket. This machine is no faster than the Jalapeno, but it's ten times as expensive, consumes nearly 20 times as much power, and it may not even exist.
@_date: 2013-05-04 03:59:16
That's nowhere near efficient. They use Nvidia's, so you get 160Mh/s worth about 3.5 cents for $2.10 per hour
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:59:28
I like to think of an investment in BTC being like burying a dollar bill and hoping to grow a money tree. It either won't work at all, or it'll make loads of cash, so a dollar isn't so bad, but I wouldn't plant $10k.
I can't imagine a situation where price just stagnates at a few hundred bucks. I think it'll either explode or drop to nearly nothing, so a small investment is all I would recommend.

[I ran a regression for ship date based on order date.](
Turns out, the R^2 is about .93, which is really high and means that that line is a pretty good approximation of when you can expect your Jally to ship. 
The equation to calculate your ship date is:
Ship date = OrderDate*0.530389934+19620.19431, assuming your spreadsheet application formats dates like Excel does. Excel counts dates as an integer from some point in the past, so if 4/19/13 = 41383, then it should work.
Mine looks like it'll be here in late October. Balls.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:45:45
Are you referring to the fact that it's an illegal marketplace? Because that's comparing apples to oranges.
Assuming that both companies are on the up and up, I'd much rather deal with a business that admits that something has gone awry than one that tries to cover up their mistakes as they get worse. At least with the first company, you have information and options. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:19:32
Because merchants pay fees on transactions.
Cash doesn't carry an obvious fee, but it still has to be counted and carried to the bank. It depends on the company, but cash transaction fees are typically nontrivial.
Credit cards are usually between 2%-3% of the ticket, plus monthly service fees and fees per transaction. 
IIRC, the service that instantly converts to fiat charges around 1%. It doesn't sound like a lot, but that additional 1-2% adds up very quickly. Besides, accepting BTC is a novelty right now, so it brings in additional customers that want to spend their coins.

Well, my 600Mh/s only really makes three internets per day. So it's a large portion of my earnings, but not very much in the grand scheme of things. I justify mining at BTCguild by saying that my little 7970 doesn't have enough power to make a difference one way or the other, so I'm going where I can make the most cash.
Really, the biggest four guys on BTCguild just need to be mining by themselves. The top four miners there make up 15% of the entire NETWORK. Each has over a terrahash/s, and the top miner has 7Th/s.

I worked as an installer for 7 years, and have bought all kinds of stuff off craigslist (the keyboard I'm typing on, the chair my ass is planted in, the speakers my music plays on...Craigslist is great)
So all in all, I've been to the homes of a few thousand different people, and I'm pretty sure I haven't been murdered yet.
If you're doing a transaction with somebody like that, you're a random person. If they want to kill a random person, there are much easier ways to do it. Just go to a mall, there are random people everywhere there.
