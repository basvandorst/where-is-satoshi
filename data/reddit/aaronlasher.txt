Yup, similar story here, but with an unfortunate ending. Friend who got married in Sweden couldn't cash my US check, so I sent him 10 BTC when the price was about $11. At the time he thought it was really cool.
Fast forward to last week, when he sends me an email. OMG! They are worth $450! What the hell are these things? So I patiently explain. Then he comes back saying that he told a friend about them, and his friend said that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme. Now he wants to sell them immediately and won't hear anything to the contrary.
Also, gave a friend some Bitcoins to play with when they were $5 each. Sent him an email last week seeing if he was enjoying the recent rise in price. Turns out he had forgotten about them and had since reformatted his hard drive. I had warned him so many times about how to keep his coins safe, and now he may one day seriously regret being so careless. But dammit I want those coins back.
Looks like I'm not having the best of luck getting my friends on the Bitcoin train!

Maybe a more succinct way of me putting it would be. If it's easy to get the price to a certain place, then it's hard to keep it there while trading big.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:04:33
Yes, I've also wrestled with the fundamentals. With an increasing price your holdings should go down denominated in BTC. But in USD they will almost certainly be going up.  
  
Best to think of a BTC investment as a hedge against a price correction, or in anticipation of stability. But, yes, if you think the price is going sky high, put your money in BTC for the time being.

Yes, I think we're getting to the bottom of it now. My point to that argument is that the only reason there would be few bids or asks between 125 and 140 is if a large transaction just cleared the plate. i.e. The panic has already started.

I think we probably disagree on multiple points, which would take an enormous amount of time to discuss. But I would summarize my position, bluntly as follows:  
  
1) Public official accountability doesn't really exist. You're vote doesn't really matter.  
  
2) Artificially and technocratically expanding or contracting the money supply to "match" the economy is an ill-founded idea, as nobody is smart enough of trustworthy enough to do it, and it's not necessary since money can originate in the marketplace.  
  
3) There is no reason you couldn't pay for anything in Bitcoin, including property taxes. Municipalities can already use E-Gov Link to accept it.  
  
4) Taxation is theft, and isn't necessary to begin with.  
  
My guess is that you will disagree with most of my positions. But I would be happy to try and convert you if you like.

Can you think of any scenario which could result in mass shutdowns?  What if FinCEN decides to peg miners as terrorists and threatens to invade their homes. I suspect that miners are tough to spook, but it could have an effect. Shutting down pools would certainly reduce the incentives to mine.   If energy costs go through the roof, miners won't be squeezing pennies out if their rigs, they'll be bleeding them.  What I'm getting at is that we may want to implement some emergency code that allows for a difficulty decrease before 2016 blocks provided the average block rate is below a certain threshold for a given period of time.

Ah, I see your point. That dollars with be worth something else. I agree and will perform future analyses with something we can all relate to such as big macs :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:04:50
No argument with you about the irrational exuberance. And I wouldn't be surprised if we see a big correction in the short term. In fact, I'm hoping for one as I think it would blow off a lot of the recent overly-optimistic expectations.  
  
And not to belabor the counter-party aspect. But now that we've agreed that any exchange of money has this risk, I want to point out that simply holding most forms of currency has counter-party risk.   
  
If you hold fiat currency, there is a risk the government that issues it will default. If you keep deposits in a bank, which is essentially a loan to them, there is a risk that the bank will go broke or not honor that note. If you buy a gold ETF, there is a risk that the issuer will default, or sell more contracts than there is gold at his or her disposal, if you buy a mortgage-backed security, there is a risk that the borrowers will foreclose, etc.  
  
So when we look at simply holding Bitcoins, in comparison to holding other forms of currency or wealth, there is no counter-party who's action or inaction could affect that fact. If you have 10 Bitcoins in your wallet, it's basically a contract between you and math.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:47:25
Not necessarily, even with different accounts. If you simultaneously buy and sell an amount at the spot price, it will not effect the price. If you asynchronously issue a buy and sell, you will affect the price, but you'll be buying/selling to strangers in the meantime. If you issue a buy or sell above or below the asking price, you will be exchanging with strangers as well.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:49:27
OK, I see your point. But even if the US government never accepts Bitcoin directly. I will still be able to exchange my Bitcoins for USD when I have a tax liability. In fact, I do it already.

Hi Fred. In case you are called upon to defend all of the hackings, volatility, and uncertainty about Bitcoin, feel free to use my "baby" analogy. I've found that it helps people to put everything in perspective:  
  
"From the practical perspective, Bitcoin has already proven itself. Last year I was able to send my friend in Sweden a 10 BTC wedding gift after my US check bounced at his local bank. Already, today, Bitcoin beats Western Union. People complain about volatility and uncertainty, but they do so misunderstanding that these are features of a nascent financial vehicle - not rebuttals to the concrete practical benefits of Bitcoin. It's similar to claiming that a baby cries, or can get sick, which is independent of its potential as a human being.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:24:16
Sorry for all of your troubles.  
  
But remember, those are all 3rd party service providers that you mentioned. Bitcoin remains, in fact, all those wonderful things that you were promised.
@_date: 2013-03-15 13:29:29
Agreed. OMG, I'm totally doing this from now on. Oh, you don't want the Bitcoin? OK, I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:30:31
Correct. What I was saying was that if the price doesn't move, to the left, you should see only green bars above 0 (on the right access), and only red bars below 0. Right of the price, you should see only red bars above 0 and only green bars below.  
  
But sometimes, when the price moves around, you can see green bars below 0 to the left of the price (and all 3 other permutations), which can be confusing.  
  
By "above the green bid line" I would have been clearer saying "left of the price." Thanks for pointing that out.

@_date: 2013-04-05 16:31:54
Of course I'm serious. Counter-party risk: "The risk that the other party in an agreement will default." When you hold Bitcoins, there is no existing counter-party, as there are with dollars, ETFs, stocks, options, etc.

Yes, I agree with you. Anytime you order something with BTC, whether instantly or through escrow, just top off your wallet at the same time. Then you're paying with Bitcoins with the volatility risk of dollars.  
  
Come to think of it, somebody should create a "top-off" solution that always keeps your hot BTC wallet at the same level...hmmm. Might have a new project on my hands.

Fair point. Anybody involved at this level knows the inherent risks, including occasional client bugs on top of the natural production of orphaned blocks (such a sad term, no?)
The sentiment I was conveying was one of solidarity. PartTimeLegend expressed a well-founded perspective that other miners may agree with. While I suspect that most miners will stoically yet willingly relinquish any mining profits, we should be careful not to be disrespectful of their contribution to the network.

I think you make some very valid points. Many people are speculating that the Bitcoin price will rise and this is their only reason for buying any. However, this motivation is not necessarily exclusive of all the real benefits that Bitcoin has to offer above and beyond traditional currencies:  
  
- Cannot be counterfeited
- Limited in supply
- Cannot be confiscated
- Global
- More cryptographically secure than banks
- No counter-party risk
- No or extremely low transaction fees  
- Dormant payment mediation, escrow, and assurance contracts capabilities
  
I respect your self-reflective analysis, but personally, I find the revolutionary properties much more interesting than potential appreciation in dollar value, and there are many other like me.

Ah, yes. It's all very confusing.   
  
Here it is directly from the horse's mouth (if you go to bitcoinity and click on WTF).  
  
About these bars going up and down (if there are any at the moment). They show market depth changes over the last 10 minutes. The value axis for them is on the right [BTC]. Bars on the left of the current price are bid offer changes, and on the right ask offer changes. So if somebody is adding a bid offer, you will see a green bar up on the left. About colors: if bids are added they are in green, and when removed they are in red. For asks it's the opposite. That's because when somebody is adding an ask, it makes it harder for the price to go up (red). If somebody is removing an ask it's easier for the price to go up (green).  
  
And then they reference this link

This strategy seems to carry a lot of risk. For instance, after somebody sells 500 BTC, the $140 price can just as easily snap back immediately as it can stay low at $115 for a time. If you were really unlucky, your sell order would be gobbled up by a big buy and the next thing you know the price is $150.  
  
I don't doubt that people may try to scare others through what you would call manipulation. But they are still putting their money at risk, and I imagine that more than one person has lost their shirt trying to execute these tactics.

Today, people who take out loans from banks are the first to receive "new" money. So are you saying that the government should issue these loans to people instead of the banks? That would make it debt based like today.  
  
I think the answer that you are looking for is that they would issue brand new debt-free dollars and then spend them directly on goods and services in the general economy, which I would argue is unfair to the rest of the members in society who don't get to do business with the government.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:07:24
Ah, I see what you are saying. I think you are a little confused by what is meant by counter-party risk. When you talk about online 3rd party exchanges, yes, there is absolutely counter-party risk when you keep your coins with them or transfer money to/from/with them. Quite a bit, in fact, as we've seen over and over.  
  
However, when you talk about the risk that another party won't deliver a good or service after payment in Bitcoin, this risk is not intrinsic to Bitcoin itself. This is just the natural risk that people can be prone to lie cheat and steal. But holding the Bitcoins in a wallet that only you control (i.e. no Mt. Gox, Instawallet, etc.), and transferring them across the network via the blockchain does not have any counter-party risk. There is no contract that can be ignored, broken, or defaulted on.  
  
But, to further this point, Bitcoin is even BETTER than other media of exchange because it has zero-trust escrow protocols. So if you want to do business with somebody, but you don't trust their character, you can actually set up an automatic dispute mediation whereby both parties must be satisfied before the Bitcoins are transferred.  
  
I looked through some of your other comments, and I see that you often have quite a negative view of Bitcoin. I think it's really healthy to have people like you with opposing views around here, because at the moment it's probably 90% total converts. So please stick around and keep up the debate!
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:19:16
Came here to post pretty much the exact same thing. Here, have an upvote!
There is a measure in place to prevent such a drop. It is called math.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:54:17
1a) Congress can eliminate the Fed if it wants to. But I would argue they don't not because they are beholden, but because it directly benefits them. They are able to spend money without taxing people directly. This leads me to another point about accountability. If the government can decide between printing money and taxing you, they will always print money, because people notice their currency is worth less, but aren't quite sure how it happened and can be convinced that it's some evil external force.  
  
2a) I would say, no, there is no mathematically possible way to do this since value is subjective. This is the great conceit of central planning. The utility of 4,100 vs 4,200 tones of timber for example varies by individuals and time, and is non-linear. There is no "good" way to measure an economy objectively in terms of value other than general prices. Secondly, you need to explain how to inject and remove the money. Who are the privileged ones who get it first?  
  
3a) My example was just to show progress. Just a couple of years ago pretty much all you could spend Bitcoins on was pizza and alpaca socks. Just because it isn't accepted today, doesn't mean it won't be tomorrow.   
  
4a) Finally, we agree on something!

Very good article. Just wanted to correct you on one point, though. Debt getting wiped out in bankruptcies doesn't cause deflation. Bankruptcies sever the rubber band that dollars were born with (the one that takes them back to the lender, where they were created and would ultimately be extinguished), which is inflationary. When debt gets wiped out through the legitimate paying down of debts, which reduces the money supply, then it is deflationary.

I would echo other people here by saying, go to blockchain.info and open an online wallet to begin. Make sure you write down the funky word passphrase and keep it safe, and do not forget your password. Then, you'll be give an address to which anybody can send you coins, including you if you buy some.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:49:09
Not quite. So if you go to bitaddress.org, you can use a passphrase to actually generate a unique private key, which then generates a unique wallet address (you can get the address from the private key but not vice versa).  
  
It's essentially an easier way to commit your private key to memory. Then, in the future if you have deleted all your files or been extradited to Siberia or whatnot, you'd be able to recreate your private key by entering your passphrase on bitaddress.org again, or any other client-side brainwallet service.  
  
But note of caution!!! A brainwallet needs to be bullet proof. "Password" "Hello my name is Albert" or even "asldfkjaslkdfjlkasjdf" are way too weak. You're going to want something that is at least 30 characters long, has upper and lower case, spaces, special characters, and nonsense words. And remember, that the algorithm that generates the private keys is sensitive to all these things. So a misplaced comma or space will result in an entirely different key.

Does it not follow that if it is easy to move the price with small trades, that it will be correspondingly difficult to execute large trades without effecting the price even more?  
  
I do think I see what you are getting it though. Manipulation = high frequency trades of low value to change the price and effect the psychology of other traders. Does that work?

Some additional recommendations:  
  
Make your cold storage wallets from very well-constructed brainwallet pass phrases as a last resort to recover your coins if there is ever a giant SNAFU.  
  
TEST any new procedure with a small amount of coins first to make sure you've got the process right. Can't tell you how many times I've made that mistake in life.  
  
Turn off your wi-fi when making your wallets. Also, don't type your brain wallet passphrases in the correct order in case there is a keylogger on your computer that you don't know about. For instance, if my passphrase were: "I am awesome 123 $% birdwatching." Then I might type little bits and pieces, while clicking to the correct spot, so that any key logs would show "123bird   %$aweIsomeamwatching"   
  
Never keep anything sensitive on your online email accounts, since if they are hacked, a quick search for "Bitcoin" could lead an attacker straight to your coins.
   
  
If you are as paranoid as me, there are other things you can do, but that should give you a good head start towards sleeping well at night.

When you are using your client, you can just generate a new one if you like. There should be an option for it. All of your addresses should be listed in your wallet.
  
In my opinion, in the beginning, it's helpful to just keep one single address, and keep a paper wallet of its private key. That way you won't lose your coins while you start experimenting and figuring everything else out.  
  
To answer your question directly, there are no implications as long as you keep track of all of your addresses. Some people like to use different addresses so that it's more difficult to track their activity. Others are merchants who want to stay organized with regard to their revenue. For somebody like you, there is no need to use multiple addresses willy nilly. Just start with one.
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:20:45
Authentication uses what is called a digital signature. I won't get into the details, but suffice it to say that there is a mathematical way to PROVE that you own the private key to an address without actually SHOWING it to anybody. Your wallet does this for you. The network doesn't know anything about you, other than you own the private key to your wallet.
  
Not all wallets are created equal. For instance, the default client Bitcoin-qt must download the entire blockchain when you first launch it. I don't even know how many GB it is now, but I stopped using it a long time ago because it takes DAYS to download. There is no reason that you should run a "full node." Leave that to the miners.  
  
There are lightweight clients like Electrum that do not download the blockchain, but rather rely on full nodes as a reference. Go with something like this if you want to use your desktop. Remember from earlier, that you can keep your wallet on your computer, or in the cloud. It's up to you. If it's on your computer and you don't back it up, it could be potentially lost or overwritten. If it's in the cloud, it could be potentially stolen more easily. The choice is really up to you: Chance you'll lose it vs. chance you'll have it stolen.  
  
So to answer your other question, yes, you will start to get the hang of it once you open a wallet on blockchain.info (remember to write everything that they tell you to down so you don't lose access to it!), and get somebody to send you some coins. All clients, or wallets, are pretty easy to use once you play around a bit. It's straightforward to send and receive coins using them. You'll see :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:38:06
I'm torn between both of these views. On the one hand, I like that the media is generally getting the story wrong, which scares off the quick money. But it's true that in the long term, all of the people learning about Bitcoin through these outlets will have to change their opinions, and people don't like to do that.  
  
The good thing is that the benefits of Bitcoin are so great, that I think a lot of the distrust and misunderstanding will evaporate on its own as Bitcoin continues to grow.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:40:29
Thanks for the entertaining challenge. I actually tried "fuckfuckfuck" in a moment of frustration. Looks like I just needed one more fuck.
Would be fun in the future - if Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption - for some in the community to do this on an ongoing basis. Could develop medium difficulty brainwallets and release clues and hints once per year or so. Perhaps have the target wallets crowd funded to an extent.
Definitely a wonderful good old-fashioned treasure hunt that you created, something that captures the imagination and encourages adoption. Let's hope it's only the beginning for this sort of thing. Bravo!

I think Adam overestimates the power of a central bank to buy up all the Bitcoins. After about $20M worth (not very much) we would be into the thousands of dollars per Bitcoin. Before long they would be paying $1B for a Bitcoin once people saw what they were doing.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:19:48
If I could explain it to you, in very few words, imagine this.  
  
There is a "book," inside of which is a record of every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. This is called the Blockchain, and tens of thousands of computers keep a copy of it so that everybody can agree upon one history.
  
Bitcoins are stored in and transferred between little safety deposit boxes called "addresses." There is about 1 address for every 14 molecules on the planet earth. Practically, there are an infinite number of addresses.  
  
Each address has a secret key, a "private key" that can be used to unlock the coins and transfer them to another address. This key can be written down on a piece of paper, stored in a computer file, or even memorized. You can keep many copies of your key in many different ways.
  
People use "wallets," which is a program, or "client," either through a website, or on their desktop, to keep track of their addresses and to send and receive bitcoins.  
  
So, the things you have to decide are: Will I use a desktop or an online wallet? And how will I store my private keys?
  
That may have been overly simplistic, but it was for my benefit as much as anybody's, trying to boil down the basics to easily digestible concepts. Let me know if you have specific questions about how to actually "do" and of this.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:50:40
LOL. This is how I've always felt about stock analysts. If you can't be right about what the stock is going to do tomorrow, why should I listen to your reasons for what it did yesterday.

@_date: 2013-04-03 16:35:45
I've also wondered how this can be generalized to the overall population.  
  
I would be willing to wager that Bitcoin buyers are actually above average in their financial education, considering some of the conversations I've had with regular people.  
  
Here's a fun one for you. A few months ago, my father in law was thinking of accepting an offer to work at a recently IPO'd company. "They are a really good company, and the stock is trading at $14 per share!" he said.  
  
"Oh, what is their market cap?" I asked.  
  
"Huh? The price is $14!"  
  
That's it. $14. That was enough to get him excited.

The exponential move of 0.19% per day? Yes it doesn't seem TOO bonkers, but I mentioned the linear figure in the title just to show how substantial the average per day bitcoin price increasewould end up being.

They probably figure people are smart enough to make the decision themselves. I would agree with many early orderers that it was an interesting proposition, especially if you could get your hands on the first batch. But people ordering today confuse me a bit. At this point, whether they will deliver in the next month, 6 months, year, ever, etc. is very much up for debate. But even if they do deliver, if you are last in line, you'll be punching out pennies a day by the time the network is amped up to high triple figure THashes.

@_date: 2013-03-18 14:25:46
That's an interesting point. Would be difficult to calculate the value of price stability. Intuitively, I would expect that it will eventually stabilize on its own, which will be a very good thing when it's used widely and frequently. However, in the short term, a rising price may be even more beneficial than a stable one, since it garners attention. And after all, if Bitcoin is ever going to go mainstream, it's valuation would have to be much higher, so the price will have to rise anyway. If this individual would benefit long-term from a price rise, why try to stop it now?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:31:58
Close. Red lines always sellers. Green lines always buyers.  
  
The bars can correspond to either buyers or sellers. Think of green bars as either people jumping into the line of buyers or jumping out of the line of sellers - this reduces the resistance to a higher price.  
  
Conversely, red bars mean that buyers are leaving or sellers are joining the lines. Like the lines, the bars have a corresponding price point, so if the price is $100 per bitcoin, and you see a green bar at $120, it means that somebody just removed their sell order at that price in the recent past.

Maybe it's just semantics. I don't doubt that people with large holdings can MOVE the market. That much is obvious. What seems clear to me is that selling hard with tons of slippage blazes a trail downwards with nobody behind you. You eat up all the bids and you leave the asks in the dust.  
  
Now you're sitting on a bunch of cash, but you turn around and there is nobody to sell to. Meanwhile other traders see a buying opportunity and the price starts going up again. If you begin buying, it will go up even faster, and by the time you get you your original sell point, there is a good chance you've lost most of your money.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:55:37
I'm totally with you on the debt-free stuff. No argument there.  
  
With regards to your system of too little or much inflation, it may be preferable to our current system by leaps and bounds, but I believe it still relies too heavily on the subjective and limited information of a few powerful people. Even if they don't mean to, they will probably to a bad job.  
  
My argument about the tones of timber was to illustrate that things only have a value as relayed from the market place. People may not need timber right now, so the incremental utility of 100 tones could be effectively worthless to the economy. My point is that there is no way to account for this, for every little transaction and preference, if you are in charge of the money supple.  
  
Also, you failed to mention who gets the money first when politicians decide to expand it's supply.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:47:12
I would say they are quite different. One the one hand, people with the power to create money will be tempted to spend it on pet projects that they see fit, at the direct expense of other people holding that currency. It's a deleterious, systemic effect that has gone on since the beginning of time and that we can still observe today. 
  
Trusting people with guns is a different matter. You, personally, may not trust people who own guns. But then again, I don't trust people who can't spell the word "definitely."

And no, Satoshi will only reappear if you tap your heels together three times and say: "There's no currency like Bitcoin, there's no currency like Bitcoin, there's no currency like Bitcoin!"

Your mom is compounding.  
  
Couldn't resist. But, OK, I misunderstood and thought you were talking about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:38:40
I'd also like to compliment you for your good etiquette. 
  
If bitcoin were to adopt such a tweak, I truly believe that it would lose the majority of its current advocates. Aside from the visceral feeling that any type of taxation is a thinly veiled theft, it speaks to a point that you made that I think should be emphasized: bitcoin rewards saving above spending. This goes to the heart of the debate between two very different philosophies of money. And many people here, including myself, believe that savings and underconsumption are the bedrock of true capital formation, and that manipulating money so as to encourage indiscriminate spending causes many of the systemic problems that we observe in our financial systems today.

I think they tried to apply the definitions very precisely, which is how they twisted the bet into a draw. But if they REALLY want to be technical, we can nitpick:  
  
"This bet concerns the 3 ... BitForce SC..."
  
To qualify as a BitForce SC Single, the one they hashed should have had the dimensions as per the website: Size: 100.32 mm x 100.32 mm x 80.49mm. Clearly, those were not the physical dimensions of the hardware they were running.  
  
Also, did anybody else notice that coinjedi removed the bet from the betting history?
  
At least he does give an explanation for the decision if you follow the old link: "Editor's note: We have carefully examined both sides of the argument. First of all, on our site title is definitely part of the agreement. We do not count the current status as BFL "shipping" the products, therefore other bets are still open. On the other hand the conditions in the description are met. Unfortunately the statement description, as it is written, can be interpreted as complementary conditions to shipping for more clear evidence or the definition of shipping. As much as we would like to settle the bet on one side (as we would earn a significant commission) we do not think that the situation is unambiguous under these circumstances which would be very hard to foresee at the time of statement initiation. As we have been doing before, we will continue to call a draw if there is a such an ambiguity. All the bets will be refunded without any commission."

I've always felt this way.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:24:23
So would it be a 100% reserve bank or would it issue loans on a fractional basis? Because unless it's 100% reserve it would be creating credit and increasing the money supply through debt. Credit = debt.

That was kind of fun snooping through everybody's wallets to see what they've been up to lately.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:18:40
Yeah, seriously. Can't we just get this thing mainstream and accepted already? I'm impatient for the 60 Minutes episode when Satoshi (Satoshis) comes out and talks beautiful cryptographic shop to the world.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:12:41
I've often wondered myself. Due to the titles of some posts since January, I think a lot of people first learn about bitcoin, then learn about mining, get really excited and start searching for mining rigs. VOILA! They find a nice professional-looking website with pretty pictures, and without doing anymore research plunk down the money for a pre-order.  
  
Then, after happily establishing their place in the queue, they come to reddit to ask what people think about mining rigs from BFL.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:42:04
Perhaps we're mincing words a bit. I just mentioned to tuzki that I wouldn't disagree with the claim that people with large holdings can move the market. But moving and manipulation are quite different, and whether you buy or sell, all things being equal, the immediate result is that you cannot do a 180 and go the other way without a loss.  
  
Agreed, if you can somehow cause a true panic, then you could benefit from it. But there are a lot of people who own Bitcoins who aren't so easily frightened. Would be tough.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:58:35
Oh, yes of course. The world would look very different if Bitcoin ever made it that far. No argument there.  
  
Nominally, however, the dollar figures still hold.  
  
Like you, I would expect a vibrant and growing Bitcoin economy for this to ever come to pass. But there are other possible scenarios such as a horribly crippled US economy with Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation. That would get us to $2 Trillion without much of a problem.  
  
Worth noting that the post isn't a prediction, just an interesting benchmark.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:09:46
And what advantage does one get in selling Bitcoins to oneself while incurring transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:26:56
Errors like this have been brought up a bunch recently. Most people just contact Coinbase to return the money. Then Coinbase says thanks.

Just curious where you found the exchange rate. Could have sworn those things were toast. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 02:20:39
You could be right with points 1, and 3. And there are many people on Wall Street who calculate the best ways to unload a position with as little slippage as possible.
But for point 2, I would posit that nobody can really control the market. If somebody buys a lot, the price slips upwards away from their reach. If they sell a lot, the price plummets to the point where they don't make as much. 
If you were to fight the market to keep prices stable, it would be at a loss. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 05:17:50
I like how you put it. From now on I will just bust in on my friends randomly and say, BITCOIN! This is 1. Then, after 8 times I'll say: "OK, are you finally ready to embrace the future and cast off your shackles?"

This is actually a problem? I might have a solution.  
  
Step 1, buy a Casascius Coin.  
  
Step 2, Use a very fine blade to saw the coin into as many different pieces as you want. You could do halves, or quarters, even more!

Either that or it gets better. Depends on your attitude I suppose
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:03:12
Compounding = exponential :-)  
And I'm not sure what you mean about the inflation. Bitcoins inflate at a linear rate that is reduced by 50% every 4 years. And with every day that linear increase is a smaller percentage of the total extant Bitcoins. So if anything, the inflation rate is "uncompounding"

SOOOO annoying. Had this experience with a friend that I wrote about on another post. Chucked him a few coins when they were worth $5, told him how to take care of them, gamble them, spend them, or send them. Told him about their ungodly potential.
...YUP, he reformatted his hard drive. Oops. Easy come, easy go. But sonofabitch I want those coins back.

But only if you want to turn a profit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:10:05
Left to right, up to down.  
  
Just kidding. It's a market place. Think of the green graph as a group of people standing in line holding up money saying: "I'll pay $110 for 20 Bitcoins!" "I'll pay $X for Y Bitcoins" etc.  
  
People on the right are those in line saying "I'll sell you Z Bitcoins for W Bitcoins" etc.  
  
The lines are cumulative, meaning that as they go further away from the action, they account for all the money available from both the buy and sell groups.  
  
In the middle, every time there is a trade, a seller and buyer come together and make a deal, and then the lines change accordingly.  
  
Hope that helps!  
  
Also, the bars are just an indication of recent changes in the offers. More red means it's been trending towards a lower price scenario and more green means it's been trending towards a higher price scenario.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:40:53
Luckily we have people like those at BitPay who remove the exchange rate risk for the merchants. The price doesn't really matter.
