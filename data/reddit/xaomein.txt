You may be right, but how much damage will be done in the meantime? I had to pay $68 to transfer from my hardware wallet and wait 3 hours. That's not viable long term. This is doing major damage to the brand

If it's a game for the rich, then it's lost its way

I didn't get fucked, I made a nice profit in the last month. I took my profits and went another direction. If you can't spend it, what's it worth really? I'm willing to come back if the problems get fixed, but I'm not optimistic at this point.

Good luck to you!

Honestly, I don't think you're wrong, but that's still a problem and is hurting the platform for now

I'm actually quite happy. If I'd cashed out completely to fiat I'd still be light years ahead of the S&amp;P or any other investment. In fact, crypto has ruined me on traditional investing.
Honestly, I'd like to see a real fix get implemented. I'd love to see Bitcoin stay the dominant player in the cryptosphere. But if you look at whats happening, it's going to implode. It needs to fix it's issues. The block size is causing problems. As more mainstream media picks up on this, they will write more FUD articles about it and the money will continue to move to other, more viable coins.
I'm not happy about this. Bitcoin was my onramp to this wonderful world, but my eyes have been opened and I see more potential in other places.

Advice, no. Discussion, yes.
I have my opinions, others have theirs. I was curious why others did not come to the same conclusions as me. Without discussion Reddit would be quite boring.

It will, and I'll be back if/when it does. But that doesn't mean that bitcoin will still be the dominant player. MySpace was all the rage at one point...

I think there's a fair amount of FUD out there, but these are real issues that need addressing
