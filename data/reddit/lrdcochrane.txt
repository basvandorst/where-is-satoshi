Bitcoin was always backed by something. It's trust. Same as any other FIAT.
Fiat has its trust based on the government funding it. BTC trust is in the system itself.

But it is just like Vegas... there is a one in ten chance people will pay.
If those odds were one to 10k or to 10M maybe we'd see less of this.

Probably them mempool is not big enough to warant blocks larger than 1MB. 
Alternatively, antpool could be privately mining BCC. The blocks we are seeing is due to part of the hashrate is still on the core chain.

One of the "car-wash" anti-corruption operation phases hit the streets today. It is all over the news how bitcoin was used to transfer some of the dirty money out of the country. I believed they were down due to ongoing investigations.

The other way around. They are incentivizing demand for the ARS. 
Argentina already has a huge problem in terms of dolarization (ie. prices and wages are indexed to the usd) meaning that inflation/currency devaluation is quickly factored into prices/wages which bring more inflation. This spirals out of control and is the basis of hiper-inflation. 
The biggest problem when it comes to supply is the government itself, but not for paying huge interest rates. What happens is, the Argentinian government operates at a net loss, meaning it has to borrow money to keep running. Supply and demand dictates how much interest is needed to keep raising money this money (money that will, in turn, be used to pay USD linked wages) so its not hard to see this is totally unsustainable. 
Argentina last year has actually resorted to a somewhat bizarre primitive rates process where there is no central indicative of rates. Government now operates 100% according to market rates. 
The point that is usually missed on hyper-inflation is that wealthy individuals usually are able to fend against the currency devaluation. 
However, those that depend on wages (which lag behind the inflation/interest curves) suffer the most.  In a nutshell, inflation is the most intense mechanism ever invented for wealth concentration and inequality.

Not true. Interest rates in Argentina have also risen to match the ongoing inflation. Its around 60% p.y. nowadays.

Overly simplified, but not wrong at all. 
The “cavalo” plan (named after finance ministry called Cavalo) actually pegged the peso to the USD. 
And yes, wages from the public sector are a significant chunk of that economy and yes they are pegged to the usd and yes that makes the government need to raise money / print additional money.
