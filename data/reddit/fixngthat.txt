The network overload is hurting all BTC users and users of Abra gets the brunt of the abuse because Abra just also happens to be one of the absolutely worst wallets in terms of estimating fees.  
What is so bad about Abra:
1. The app will not let you set your own custom fee, so you are stuck with whatever the wallet wants to charge you at any given time. No choice. 
2. There are no ways to set priorities. One single high-priority fee is all you get from Abra, take it or leave it.
3. If you take it, and then later check your TX on the blockchain, you will see that the fee which Abra charges is HIGHER than the actual miner fee attached to the transaction. So, in other words, Abra takes a cut for itself.
4. Despite the company's assurances of so called "private keys", the 13 word seed which Abra gives you is incompatible with other wallets and all known HD tools. So you can not sweep your wallet into anything else as a way to "hack" a lower, customized fee. 
I moved my last BTC out of Abra a few days ago and into Coinomi, which is a wallet app that lets you set your own fees and convert to faster, cheaper coins such as BCH and ETH from within the app itself. To get my BTC out of Abra, I paid more than $30 for the privilege of moving my own money. Some $23 of that went to miners fees on the network, to send the transaction, and the rest was taken by the Abra app and forwarded neither to me nor to the network.
Abra also insisted on keeping just under 550 satoshis as dust in the wallet. They claimed that their policy was that no wallet of theirs could ever be completely empty, despite my adamant wish to empty it and delete these characters from my life entirely. There are better low-cost alternatives.

Abra is not the best choice, IMHO. 
Closed source. 
Does not put you in control of your private keys (Abra's 13 seed words are not compatible with any wallet or HD tools). 
Fees are determined by Abra and there is no way for the wallet's owner to set a custom fee for lower priority transactions. As a result, each payment on Abra is currently hit with an absurd fee of $25 to $30 per transaction (due to the BTC backlog).

As the others have said, the answer is YES. Absolutely yes, in fact.
Just in the past 24 hours there was a more in-depth detailed discussion about this [here]( where a user had the same issue. You can also see my log of past posts where I have helped others do this and linked to the official repositories of some wellknown and wellregarded opensource tools which you can safely run offline.

Actually, no.  I have both transacted and moved BTC several times over the past couple of weeks and believe me when I say: This is getting worse and worse by the day now.
Or don't believe me. Just try a few transactions on your own and then report back here.  
I love the original premise of BTC but it is also time to face reality and realize that, as the OP wrote, there are now actually lots of coins to choose from today.  BTC will no doubt remain  for the foreseeable future, but until the current broken situation is fixed it would be just plain irresponsible to keep all your eggs in one single basket.

This is actually a very serious problem for all of us who hold BTC (as I still do).  The Ostrich approach is the absolute wrong approach to this.

I was an Abra user for a while. I originally liked their "teller" feature, but they abandoned that and left everyone hanging. Their assurance of users having access to their own private keys turned out to be untrue upon closer inspection and the company's support is unhelpful (as OP found out, too). 
So I moved my remaining balance out of Abra and into another wallet app earlier this week. 
In order to do that, I had to pay more than $30 in fees for the privilege of moving my own money to myself. Part of that was bitcoin's fault (for the mempool backlog and current network lag) and part of that was my own fault (for not having the foresight to consider alternatives like bitcoin cash sooner).  
But forking over a hefty $30 in fees was worth it just to never have to deal with the Abra wallet app again...

Guilty as charged, Your Honor!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:10
Correct. (Although I thought it used to be 30, not 20).
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:21
Some of us actually do care. It is bad for the network, bad for the reputation of the leading crypto currency, and also very bad for us as individuals since this is after all MY money which is being taken out of MY pocket every time I try to use it. 
Average transaction fee for the past 24 hours was $28. [Proof here.](
Median was $16. [Fact.](
Users make a BTC transaction and see 20% going up in smoke, just to cover fees.
So just use Segwit instead? Not even Segwit is the answer anymore. Even the simplest SegWit transaction (1 input 2 outputs) costs $10 in my Trezor's Economy-setting.

Did you send Bitcoin Cash to your friend to get him started with a wallet app? If so, I believe you. But for Bitcoin BTC, there is no way that a fee 35 cents could go through in the past few days with BTC's current mempool backlog. I know because I have a transaction stuck for 3+ days with a $10 fee. So: TX link or it didn't happen.

In three more days it should drop out of the mempool and returned to you. Then you will again be able to spend the bitcoins from your own wallet. It will be as if this transaction never existed.
The miners are really not to blame for this. The absurdly high fees result from the fact that the blocks are too small to hold the current high amount of transactions which are being pushed into the network. 
Solution: Increase the blocksize. Simple as that. Fixed. (Unless someone is trying to artificially cripple BTC, in which case just let the blocks stay small and let the network stay broken).

Was a BlackBerry user for years. They had the BEST keyboard in the industry.  I have since been forced to move on, but even to this day I still miss the feel of that keyboard.
Also used to be a Bitcoin user for years. Still hold some BTC, which is getting harder and harder to move. But it is clear that there are alternatives out there with less stubborn and cocky leadership, not ignoring the needs of the masses.

Super helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:20:50


Yes, agree. Time to increase the block size.
Needed urgently.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:26:00


mmmm.... okey.  
But for some of us, sadly, sometimes we don't have a choice. And sometimes we are not even able to choose the fees ourselves (just today I moved some funds off an exchange and into my own wallet. Was forced to pay 700sat/byte, or in other words $30 for that particular transaction. Yes, we can blame the exchange for that. But that didn't make it sting any less for me.)

Unfortunately, $20 is a good deal for BTC right now. The current fee seems to be above $23. Source: 
Not being a shill or even trying to. But if the community wants to improve this situation, everyone must face the facts and currently it is really hard to argue with these cold, hard numbers. 
Facts are facts, whether we like them or not.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:18:56
Obviously, your case was an outlier because of a large TX size due to a huge number of small inputs.  But even so, how can someone ever hope to explain the benefit of BTC to a newcomer when there are actual use cases today of someone (like you) who needs to pay nearly a thousand bucks in fees.... Something is clearly broken, whether we like it or not.
While yours is a special case, an an outlier, normal users are getting clobbered with high fees right now, too:
The average transaction fee for the past 24 hours is $28 while the median is $16.
