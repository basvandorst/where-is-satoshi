Based off my technical analysis, 23k is the next high. (23078.33 to be exact.)

I did on another comment under this one, excuse me if you can't find it. I'm still fairly new on reddit.

beauty of TA, never know who's wrong until it happens. I personally think the "dip" is over, of course you're not going to get just straight rise as I'm expecting some minor corrections, but I'm very bullish on it as of right now.
Could be wrong, but part of TA is trusting your own skills.

looking at the daily timeframe, there was sellers exhaustion since the 22nd, it's retracing at 38.2% now, bearish movement was broken on the 25th and we are now bullish. There are some major points of resistance that it will have to break in order to keep pushing. That "dip" that everybody was freaking out about was just price testing support, from the previous "dip". That was probably too long.

First target I'm expecting it to hit is 8681.35, then possibly hitting 10057.09 before starting some sort of significant pullback. The weekly candle now is showing a lot of buyers momentum. Bitcoin is like no other chart, it loves to ride the trend. I think it hitting 10K could very much happen before the year is out.

Nothing goes up forever this is regular market behavior, just keep HODLing.

I wanted to try and invest at least a couple hundred starting off but personal problems. I might go ahead and invest what I can now and just build on that.
