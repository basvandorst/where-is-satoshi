I never hated Shia, but I've never cared for his movies. They're not bad -- just not for me. However, I respect his enthusiasm for art as a whole, and I have the deepest respect for him creating these videos; they're a gift to the world. I say, "Keep it up, Shia!"

Which kinda defeats the entire fucking point...

Not sure you're understanding the argument. You can keep all your money hidden all you want, but as soon as it's spent, it's in the blockchain *forever*. So, if a government, curious, stumbles upon that transaction, they *can* trace the blockchain.

Cash doesn't have a ledger associated to everywhere it's been spent.

Again, I think you're missing the point. They can track *you* to *you spending anything*. The transactions are all logged, *forever*, in the blockchain. They will always be able to trace *you* to any of your transactions.

Harassment, alarm, distress. Honestly, I'm not sure.

I'm pretty sure that can still be audited.

There are indecency laws and laws against slander, and there are also some laws against reciting intellectual property.

The point is that we don't have complete freedom of what we say. Logistically, there are reasons for such boundaries, and it borderlines on the essence of censorship.

Sure, but most harassments are not deemed objectively. Piss off the wrong government worker, and you will get censored.

It's so *They* get to define you instead of you defining yourself.

It means you're waking up...

*And, though the holes were rather small, they had to count them all.*

Reverse psychology?

It just seems amazing that we're not going after the people funding the organization or buying their oil. Seems like a dangerous problem to ignore.
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:48:52
I wasn't aware that this was a trend. What kinds of ideas are people pitching? What problems are they trying to address?
@_date: 2015-11-17 05:14:49
Now explain that to the refugees: NATO financing ISIS.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:34:15
Ok, so what's funding ISIS?
