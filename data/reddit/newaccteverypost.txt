If you read the posts and threads from the past week or two they pretty much cover your questions and the different possibilities that could play out. (r/bitcoin &amp; r/bitcoinmarkets) It's highly speculative at this point, the way Gox has handled their communication with the public is far from superior, and with recent news its hard to tell if they are purposely acting that way to get the price down to arbitrate coins on different exchanges to become solvent. If you in fact loose your coin, realistically there is nothing you will be able to do, besides talk about small possibilities on forums that are unlikely to play out unless your hire an attorney and put some strong money behind it. Just look at it as a lesson learned in a new, growing, and volatile market.

Jesus, does anyone here invest in real markets? This is life lesson 101 with investing. Money comes and money goes. I am not going to kick people while they are down but shit, this is a hard lesson learned for a lot of people and one that many people don't learn until they loose big. Shame on anyone person that invested their life savings into this; they are incompetent and this past week will be a valuable lesson in the future. I come from experience as my family lost over $5mil in '08 in forex trading (85% of our wealth).

I understand a few of your points. I believe the Bitcoin revolutionizes the traditional payment method in the fact that it can help business' bring you cheaper product and provides competitiveness which is what capitalism strives on. I read in the nytimes a typical online electronics business generally runs a profit margin of 5%, credit card processing fee's are 2.5%...obviously you can tell that's a 50% increase in profit off the bat by using Bitcoin. And then, being a peer to peer transaction, business' can now accept international payments with ease which is generally not possible the conventional way because of our current banking systems. I think those a just a few of the pro's. Now as far as your investment goes, I would recommend selling some and investing into other baskets if you haven't already. I wouldn't say you should totally eliminate your investment, especially since your already sitting in the green. The amount of volatility in each one of these pivots currently is a day trader's dream and not necessarily cut out for a person going completely long with a weak stomach. Just don't get caught up playing Monday night quarterback and save a little.
