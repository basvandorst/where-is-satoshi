Ill be able to tell you this week!
(gonna be buying bitcoins for the first time "over the counter so to speak")
so far there has always been a guy..
should be 2-4 days, the dirty bank of course needs time to take its cut.
who are you ordering them with?
@_date: 2012-09-19 09:51:37
Ancaps are asshats. The militant anarchists on the other hand have been using and propagating BTC for a while now.
@_date: 2012-12-19 07:38:50
ahh I wish this was true of everyone here it would be such a nice place
@_date: 2012-08-29 19:22:18
I have absolutely nothing to contribute as far as the technology goes, But as a player it feels like sealswithclubs is really easy to collude on.
Im not gonna admit to anything here, but yeah...
People worry too much about bots and chinese slave 3-bets, and too little about collusion imo.
Then again I havent been playin in a while.
Anybody have any good alternatives to Sealswithclubs? I wanna hit the felt again and Id much rather use BTC
Still have HEM layin around as well, any Bitcoin sites that are compatible? (doubtful)
@_date: 2012-08-29 18:44:53

I have read the Tor FAQ, buddy.
I still consider myself to have the barest understanding of how it works, I can just barely explain the concept to people.
I have massive respect for the peeps behind tor, but reading their page is not an unbiased opinion.
What exactly do you mean by people projecting an image? Do you mean they kind of write you off as a kook when because you use GnuPG?
I am not againt GnuPG and have/will use it myself. If you want to know what im worried about read the answer I attempted to give to julian.

Why in the fuck is sourceforge enforcing Iranian sanctions, whaddabuncha faggots.
This all sounds pulled out of the ass however, you cant tell me an intelligent iranian will not figure out how to get BTCs
Sourceforge is also the only place you can get Liberte', if I remember correctly. So SF is DPing the iranian people by also taking one of the only truly "secure" methods of dissent/communication

and look at that primmed out pussy who says shes a "recovery clinician"
good drug counselors do NOT look like that, i.e like a fucking TMZ reporter.
talk about a hypocrite, shes condemning SR when her entire lifestyle is propped up by the "war on drugs" and its effects.

I can at the very least confirm that Gox will block your account for 24hrs if you log on with TOR which in itself is enough of a reason to say fuck them sideways and look for an alternative

Wow, I got minor goosebumps reading this. advanced 3d printing, coupled with bitcoins and theat crazy, wi-fi drone thing The Pirate Bay is busily working on could bring us into an era of true decentralization and completely eradicate government control over pretty much everything.

Anyone who is even halfway PC literate stays the fuck away from *everything* you just mentioned or circumvents all the bullshit.
"Linux" or GNU is a stable and viable alternative for businesses, there are countless tailored builds that cover pretty much everything and will probably save you work and heartache in the future.
You seem to have no concept of free software and this:
"Linux is fun, but it's a lot of work, too much for busy people. You break something, any plans you had on your agenda go out the door and you have to bust your ass fixing 4 other things that broke with it."
..makes me wonder why the fuck I am even talking to you, its borderline retarded imo and showcases a complete lack of knowledge.

I am shocked that you are getting attacked on r/btc of all places, you peeps shouldbe much more aware of this than the usual gang of idiots here on r/
@_date: 2012-08-27 16:38:38
Security through obscurity, friend. the trick is that you design your OpSec so that a violent thief can get his hands on something and not clear you out.
So f.e a Truecrypt partition in a truecrypt partition in a truecrypt partition
Partition a) f.e. has scat porn and some intimate emails, partition b has an alibi wallet+bogus bank details or something like that, and partition c has your actual coins.
Decentralize, obscure, and think things through.
Also, try to insure that its not so goddamned easy to get into your pad with a wrench and bad intentions.
@_date: 2012-12-11 00:44:43
Excellent answer, this is basically what the folks at airvpn told me.
I assume one of the risks you are referring to when using ToR is leaked DNS..requests? thats the only specific one ive heard of..
How would you say Liberte' is in comparison to only ToR? It specifically mentions the DNS thing when you switch TOR identities in liberte'
The hypothetical "who I am hiding from" could probably be summed up with "dissident in a western country"
This may not sound very dangerous atm, but I fear that may change, quickly.
I may be an expatriot but I would go so far as to say that being a dissident in America, no matter how peaceful, is already quite dangerous.
From my limited research I would agree with your statement that nation states have the capability to comprimise all of these things if interest is big enough.
What I dont understand is why anyone(no matter how "harmless") would find that statement comforting.
For me it simply translates to "we will spy on and prosecute you once we get around to it"
The recent NSA whistleblower repeatedly stated that their main focus atm is mining data, they will worry about deciphering it later. A perfect example is of course the new building in Bluffdale, Utah.
Who is to say what will merit the Govs interest in a year? How about 2, or 5? 
The powers that be have shown us again and again that "terrorism" is a label for anything challenging the status quo and western expansion, this has not changed in a hundred years.
MY fear is that the wary political activist actually going through the trouble to PGP his correspondence and surf anonymously is doing nothing more than buying himself a year or two before they round his ass up.
This fear extends to anyone involved in SR related shenanigans as well, although to a lesser degree.

I feel as if the main bottleneck for BTC is the exact opposite, turning cash into BTCs.
I do not want to use my bank account, I want to avoid Mt.Gox so basically I have to buy my bitcoins like drugs, from a guy in his apartment.
Imagine a kiosk in every city where you can walk in, plop cash on the table and immediately get BTC.
This would be amazing.
Still kudos for this friend the more possibilities the better.

Oh... Still I would check out localbitcoins, youll probably find someone in the area(meet in public tho)
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:28
Bitcoins are still extremely volatile.
There are a wealth of factors that could still have a massive impact on BTC, the main ones imo being *state* intervention, state seizure of fiat€ like in cyprus, war, online poker finally being "legalized" stateside, ASICs and their equivalents(computers specifically designed to solve BTC algorithms), criminals(not to be redundant), natural disasters etc, p.p
All in all however, Bitcoin or better yet Cryptocurrencies are a valid concept, a concept that will be embraced more and more when people start to realize how valid it is, as opposed to the usual hyenas trying to make a quick buck.
Not only is it a valid concept, I think it will be deeply beneficial for humanity as a whole.
As for me personally?
I am a delinquent. The reason I will always be holding BTCs and the reason I am busy speccing out an LTC rig as I write this is that using alternative currencies is an act of *defiance*. It is a middlefinger to the Banks, a loud fuck you to parasites like Western Union and co.
I firmly believe that BTC itself will succeed but the beauty is that it *doesnt have to*
It is an Idea whose time has come, and you cant kill an idea.
I will make no predicition on the course of bitcoin. I will however predict you this:
Fractional Reserve Banking, moneylending as we know it is going to be extinct in our lifetimes.
As for you, if you know nothing on bitcoin im NOT the person you should start listening to, look at the sidebar or better yet start with some informative videos on the YouToob

Because this is tempoary and probably due to some form of manipulation. Im hoping for a masive drop when those fuckers at gox finally open their doors again.
As for hitting zero, SR and similar sites essentially guarantee this could not happen, unless they all switch entirely to LTC or something
Dont ever forget that people are selling quite a bit of drugs and other things with BTC, and they kinda like the system they have. This will act as a bulwark to some extent.

@_date: 2013-10-03 10:01:07
Im actually pretty sure this is *exactly* what happened
you try to blackmail a guy, the guy writes you back with details about your family.
Seems like a surefire way to bring the blackmail sum down while letting you the blackmailer save face(sort of)
the actual threat in that conversation seems to have been the "ive gotten people whacked for 80k"
i.e you better accept the 150k, or I actually call a real hit, its cheaper.
I honestly doubt this DPR has had anyone killed, ever.
He was basically paying this guy to dissapear himself.

The best lamps for growing are the 600w. Even just a couple of those can get pretty expensive, prices for power have also gone up in germany (HH at least)
dunno wat kind of wattage a mining rig needs.
Indoor growing is still profitable in europe but only if you know what you are doing.
Mining probably less so but im just repeating what ive heard on that.
I have not heard of any electricity related busts and I try to keep up to date on that type of news. Usually eejits get busted cause of the smell (fking amateurs dont know what an aktivKohle filter is)
They are logging all dat info of course but what you do is call the power company beforehand  and negotiate a bigger package citing LAN games/studio whatever (they dont ask but Its always good to throw that in there), less obvious than a sudden jump in consumption.
Anyhoo, ich bin *kein* berliner but ive got a pad I can rent out here in Hamburg and id be happy to take BTC.
Finding an apartment in Berlin wont be that easy but easier than in many other german cities.
I doubt however that anyone will sign a Mietvertrag that is payable in BTC, I think you will have to do this under the hand so to speak.
i.e. someone else signs the mietvertrag, you pay him/her in BTC
Then again, Berlin seems to have the most active BTC community in germany so maybe im completely wrong.
Would you be willing to pay a small comission if someone finds you a pad? How long are you planning to stay? Will this apartment be used for something special or just for living?  Hit me back and I can get the word out, I still have some peeps in Berlin (its been awhile)

@_date: 2013-05-02 16:17:55
Holy shit, this is the answer.
No fuss, no big words, no media circus, no fucking bankers. 
Just buy a Dr. Pepper and get your fiat.
The big question is whether or not the entire payment module so to speak can be mounted on any vending machine, and how much fiat can be stored inside the vending machine.
Also whether or not one can pay in fiat and get change in BTC does not seem to be clarified in the video.
This is more revolutionary than the entire BTC ATM project.
thank you.

Interesting, the Physical bitcoin has a socalled "mini key" which you can convert into the standard Key.
User Nmat had this to say in the link provided by pixelbits:
 " Just want to add a few things about the Mini private key format.
This is essentially a compressed way to store a bitcoin private key. Casascius coins small, so the private key is represented by 22 characters printed like this:
To get the real private key, you just have to calculate the SHA-256 hash of the string. There are many online tools to calculate hashes and most linux distributions can quickly do it from the terminal:
$ echo -n "S4b3N3oGqDqR5jNuxEvDwf" | sha256sum

bitcoin needs to stabilize above all things, this increase as of late was ridiculous, you couldnt buy anything without feeling like you screwed yourself(yeah I actually buy shit with bitcoins, whoda thunk it)
Ive been expecting and waiting for something to happen for a while now
In the long run we need to kill mt gox and the very way these exchanges work, replacing them with something easier and better
Silk Road will be somewhat of a bulwark should the price REALLY go into the basement, which I simultaneously doubt and hope for.
Would not be suprised if the dark side of bitcoin helps out again, just like it propped up the currency in its infant years
Long story short, we all need to chill the fuck out, sell only what we absofuckinglutely have to, and get to thinking about how we can make Gox extinct.

Yeah it seems WAY out there to actually have someone install a BTC miner but in the comments there were a few comments on TPB claiming this guy was packing mining programs on his torrents.
Interestingly, the torrent(its a game) installed a strange little commnd window in my applocal file that would launch on startup, I erased it and my GPU defintiely isnt working hard, so I think im good but if anybody wants to check it out here is the [TPB page](

The most striking thing about this whole debacle to me was the amount of ignorance in the front page bitcoin thread. Not just from users, from the socalled "press" as well.

He is inhouse pro at SwC and self-proclaimed SwC "glorious leader", show is called DonkDown radio
Im taking about a rebirth in american online poker however, not a site with maybe a thousand regs...
I mean legislation, a mass re-opening of american rooms, a gigantic influx of fish etc. p.p.
Bitcoin was being discussed at some kind of gambling conference recently which was awesome
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:41:44

Based on various calculations and a consultation with the *lutece's*, I am going to predict that we will hit 1k fiat $ before DayZ comes out, 1k fiat€ before the end of the year, and LTC will hit 25 if not 50 fiat$ by then as well :-)

Fuck You.
The US government is beyond criminal, and your taxes are being wasted on the Military Industrial Complex or ridiculously overpriced health care.
Fucking War, Murder, Theft, Slavery and genocide is what you are funding with your hard earned tax dollars.
The ONLY fucking excuse for this is the well-being of your family. 
You however have decided to be an accessory to this madness and are now *telling others they should pay their fucking protection money to the mob*.
WHY? 
You make no clear statement what the supposed benefits of paying your taxes will be, neither for the individual nor for the U.S. or humanity as a whole. Your ONLY reason is that you have a valid fear that nonpayment will invite a visit from state goombahs that will rough you up, seperate you from your family and *stick you into a fucking cage*
You jest at the expense of people that enjoy sticking it to "the man", you attempt to imply this is somehow juvenile.
Massively understating the horrible crimes our government commits with bilge about "some doubts" as to spending is not only infantile, it is delusional.
You my friend, like the rest of us, are a fucking roman citizen. 
You fucking know what your tribute is being spent on and you are fully responsible, even more so now that you have a way of circumventing the process.

@_date: 2013-07-24 20:25:44
yeah, this seems to be the main problem:
"Specifically, in the US and Europe, there are an incredible amount of banking, money and even telecommunications rules and regulations that would have to be adhered to if the company had any hope of survival.  Not least of which was a $25 million "insurance bond" necessary as being deemed a "money transmitter" in the US."
I commend anyone trying to further this, but the banking cartels are precisely that.
I think the best way to do this would be by not calling it an "ATM", i.e "disguising" the thing as a vending machine or something similar.
Im just talking out of my ass however, youd need a couple grand to get a vending machine, not to mention the cost of installing the BTC components (which do exist apparently)
