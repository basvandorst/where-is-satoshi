File a complaint with the CFPB, they have to respond within two weeks. Every person with a Coinbase issue that goes this route gets contacted and the issue becomes resolved within the time frame.

Wow, wouldn't want him to call the bank and inquire about it. My credit union used to cancel my Coinbase purchases, I would have to call them to authorize the payment as it was auto blocked bc of fraud prevention. I asked if I could whitelist Coinbase to prevent me from having to call each time I bought crypto. They said they couldn't do that. 
Oddly enough, I never have to call them anymore. It's been like that since early 2018. I just buy crypto and it goes thru no issues. HOWEVER, if I make more than 1 purchase per day, that's when they get cancelled and I have to authorize the charges from Coinbase. 
I mean it's 2019 I don't even think most banks block Coinbase anymore. That was like a 3 month thing in 2017/2018. 
If he still has an issue load up a prepaid card with funds and purchase BTC through that.

You want to get what's called a hardware wallet. Better to be safe than sorry. 
Two leading hardware wallets are:
Ledger Nano S &amp; Trezor 
I ordered a Trezor first since Ledgers were pre-orders, but also ordered the Ledger. Trezor you can opt for express shipping it literally shows up in three days. Ledgers I think are still pre-orders, so it will be about four to six weeks before it arrives.

Pure ad hominem and conjecture. You know nothing about my investments, or me... So please stfu. You're assuming it will tank, I'm confident in my investments. Look at LTC, XMR, OMG, 0x, NEO, ETH, et al Wtf makes you think I'm only invested in BTC? Bc you're a fucking generalizer and apply a one size fits all to anyone you come across? Erroneous way of thinking dude lmfao. 
I'm invested in NYSE and crypto along with other income-producing investments. How about I knew about BTC years ago and got involved in 2013. I seriously suggest you learn what empirical evidence is... You can't just defend a position with pure ad hominem and allegations and conjecture and if you do you look like a FUCKING MORON. From the first to the last letter of your pathetic paragraph you're just assuming everything. Fucking get a life dude.
First rule of investing is you don't invest more than you're willing to lose. You sound like a total n00b that just assumes shit will fail by default. It could, it could not. Nothing is promised. I could fucking have an aneurysm tomorrow and I'd be SOL. Car wreck--dead. Who the fuck knows. 
Keep living in fear of the unknown. How's that working out for you? Assumptions lead to mistakes, so unless you are me... There's no way to know what anyone is thinking besides yourself. So stay running laps in the little peon, tunnel vision mind of yours. You're actually going to sit here and try to suck me into a subjective vs subjective argument... Yeah motherfucker.. That won't be circular at all... If you can't see that in 2009 a btc was 0.1 cent and 2013 it was $13 2016 it was $700 and now it's $4200 I don't know what to tell you... Keep thinking the next time it goes up "this will be when it tanks..." and sit on the sidelines Umm..doing whatever it is you do... Hurling  accusations and generalizations towards people you don't know in any way shape or form... Such a way to expose yourself as a low-level thinker by making such absurd generalizations...

It will be a long while. No clue, really. I'd think at least a decade, maybe longer. I think it will become increasingly more difficult to obtain a whole entire  BTC as the years go by and as we get closer to the 21mil cap. The price is always running away from you. Soon, the average Joe will find it exponentially harder to invest in BTC, because they'll be throwing thousands at it and they'll only be getting tiny fractions worth of a BTC. 
I found this article a few months ago and agree with it completely, I've held a similar view for a while now. The article was written in 2014, too. Seems spot-on to me.

That shit will be worth way more than you spent today. Go check in five years and have fun realizing you paid several magnitudes more than what you should have paid for the car. BTC has not matured and will only continue to rise as the total BTC circulation grows closer to the 21mil cap. 
Someone that paid $13 for pizza in 2013 with 1 BTC actually paid $4,000 for that pizza today. 
Extrapolate.... 
BTC is on track to $100,000 per BTC in about five years. 
You should HODL. 
Even that hotwheels Tesla lmao. Any amount paid today will be worth substantially more in the future. That's really understating it, too.

Bitmain, which has 25,000 miners humming along pulling in $250,000 worth of BTC per day. Making over 90 million a year just from the mining operation.  The CEO believes BTC will be $100,000 per BTC in five years. It's based on market cap, 21 million limited supply of BTC, and the fact that less than 1% of the global population is using crypto or BTC much less even are aware of what they are in the first place.

No, it's not horseshit. It means that if you can't stomach the potential loss of that money, don't risk it. It's applicable to people with X amount in their account and they seek to dump the entire X value into an investment. It's not wise, thus, if you cannot afford to lose it, don't invest it. We are talking about the heavily volatile world of crypto, in this case, but it also applies to investments across the board. This is applicable to the droves of people that went "all-in" with Bernie Madoff. Also, tell the people that went all-in just before the 2008 crash that investing what you can't afford to lose is horseshit. It's quite applicable. If you want to empty your bank account and amass a massive amount of debt...that's on you. Just as the commenter before me and plenty of others will tell you, though, that's not the most optimal route and certainly is not the wisest.

This. Take heed to his advice. The number one rule of investing is you never invest more money than you're willing to lose. Period. Assume the money you invest is already gone and thrown down the toilet, just like when you buy any product that isn't an income-producing investment. If you happen to make a ROI--great! Thats the mindset you should have. 
Never tell someone what to do with their money, especially to go all in. You can show them insights that you have learned and suggest looking into things so they can formulate their own opinion(s), but never dictate choices for them or even recommend they take a certain action with their money. 
I invested in BAIDU in 2009 when it was ~$118 and it rose to ~$780+ and then the stock split 10:1. Reset my buy-in price to $35 after the split... Now it's selling for 225+. 
I told my friends about it when they asked about what I had been doing lately. I was making about $300 to $450 a day with the gains it was making. Even during the down market it was making significant gains. When a few friends offered to give me money to invest for them, I told them that I wasn't comfortable with doing that. I don't advocate telling people what to do with their money. Later on some friends asked me, "what was that stock you told me about a while back?" 
I just ignored them lol. 
Tell them to look at the historical charts of Bitcoin's price movements, and to extrapolate on that. You need to stress they should understand what they are getting involved in and to not just blindly jump into something because you told them to do so. Arm them with relevant information to make their own investment decisions. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:51:51
I'm sorry but anyone that spends bitcoin is just, well, foolish. It hasn't reached maturity and it will only rise in value. Look at the historic charts as an indication. Look at the people that thought it was cool to buy stuff with BTC years ago, or even last week. You know how many people, years ago, sent whole entire bitcoins around for a good that may have cost anywhere from $13 to a few hundred... That has matured to 4K now lmfao. Gl with that. Go spend your btc for a ride at Lyft... And maybe tally up every payment you would send off and come up with a monthly and yearly cost... And then go back and check it years later... You'll feel really silly. People already do now. Yet people are still actively looking to spend it lol. Subway in Czech Republic accepts btc? I guess so... Since last week every sandwich sold since they started accepting btc is still making money and growing in value. Maybe not today but they've already made tremendous gains just a little peddle back from 4400 to 4100 last I checked btc price. 
Any retailer or merchant NOT accepting BTC as payment is freaking retarded.... Longterm... Straight genius move to accept bitcoin right now... 
But again 
It's quite absurd to use it as a currency until it matures, so, to the wise and careful, it should be treated as a store of value, much like a digital iteration of gold for the 21st century. 
That's where bch or ltc or some other contender comes in for day-to-day exchanges... Daily costs of living you would not want to use BTC as currency for the above aforementioned reason.

Your entire paragraph is littered with assumptions. Are you kidding me? Someone telling me Event X won't happen is just as valid as me saying Event X will happen. 
Old money is not designed to be transacted over the internet. Do you know why? Because it comes with it, inherent, all identifying information that can lead back to the end user, making them extremely vulnerable to identity theft just by using the payment gateway system that existed before Blockchain technology. 
It's quite obvious you don't keep up with crypto developments, because every assumption you listed as a detriment to BTC is actually the opposite. All of your concerns are being addressed and optimized, even on a govt level. Nevada says BTC and crypto are tax free commodities. 
Watch when Amazon starts to accept BTC, just like overstock has since 2014. Do you know how much money merchants are missing out on? 
The Czech Republic subway that accepts btc... $5 that grows to $80-$120 in a matter of days or weeks... The $5 purchase that continues to grow in value.. How long do you think big corps will ignore it until they have a similar response that Goldman Sachs has had recently. All of their peers following suite. It's a massive overhaul to replace an entire monetary system, homie. This takes a lot of logistical work for big-time retailers to upgrade their networks and payment gateways to accept it and it's generally a whole gargantuan undertaking to make a transition like that. This shit doesn't happen overnight. I refer you again to the historical charts of BTC for accurate metrics of forecast guidance into future movements. 
Here are the big institutional finance investors, one of the biggest investment firms in the world, urging their PEERS (financial investment cartels... Groups of whales, hedgefunds, et al) to reallocate their holdings into BTC. 
That's why you saw the market cap go from 45billion July 24 to 70 billion recently. Extrapolate...

This time it's different. The coup is now being deployed and it won't stop. Once BCH overtakes ETH in market cap and sits at  it's a battle over BTC fixing the scaling issue before BCH attempts to overtake BTC. BCH being added to Coinbase in 2018 will only drive prices higher. They will keep pumping BCH until it overtakes BTC or gets right on its ass in market capitalization. 
Check the date on this, some spooky shit:
I'm just riding the trend, I moved all my alts into BCH October 25 when it was ~$330 range. The growth of BCH is legit and is also being pumped artificially, but it will remain well above $10b market cap and the pumps will easily bring it over ETH's spot. With the BCH ABC hard fork software upgrade DAA coming soon a lot of miners will switch over as well. 
Graphene is also pretty interesting. 
Keep in mind the only reason BCH has such low transaction fees is because hardly anyone uses it in comparison to BTC. 
However, today was the first time a BTC fork overtook BTC in trading volume. BCH hit $6b with BTC at $5.4b 24hr trading volume.
The climate is very different this time, it seems the opposition has ramped up their efforts and colluded with one another to orchestrate a coordinated attack and a real stab is being taken at BTC. I suspect the trend to continue until January and then it will really kick into high gear.
I have positions in both BTC and BCH and it's uncertain where things will end up.
Bitcoin has a lot in the works:
- Lightning Network 
- RSK smart contracts
- Schnorr signatures 
- Tumblebit/Mimblewimble
- 2020 Halving
Many expect (myself included) BTC to correct to ~5K range, so this will provide a better entry point than the last few weeks.
I wouldn't expect BCH to just disappear from this attempted coup. I think it's going to get really bumpy and really nasty in the coming months ahead.
Buckle up.

Crashes are inherent parts of every market. The NYSE has crashed several times over. I experienced the 2008 crash. DOW was trading around 14,000 and then dropped to 7,000. We are now at 23,000+. In the long-term recovery is inevitable just as a crash is inevitable. It's all about your margin of safety and knowledge of cyclical patterns in securities markets that dictates your demeanor.

Fiat is currently being devalued by Bitcoin. That's why the price is so high in comparison to the USD FRN. It's called Gresham's Law in economics. The bad money (fiat) circulates within the economy and the good money (BTC) exits the economy and is held onto as the valuation goes up. That is what is currently happening. It will continue to happen until the currency matures. It's a long way from that, so people will continue to HODL and use the essentially worthless fiat while storing the stronger currency.
Simple economic math. For $12K/BTC market cap must be ~$200b. Currently @ $120b @ $7200/BTC.
$800K/BTC would require $13.3T market cap.
$1,000,000/BTC = $16.7T market cap.
Not only is it very possible, it's probable.

I can tell you're not into history. It's factual. You're uninformed so I suggest you start reading up.
Let me help you:
In the final days of World War II, 44 leaders from all of the Allied nations met in **Bretton Woods, New Hampshire** in an effort to create a new global economic order. With much of the global economy decimated by the war, the United States emerged as the world's new economic leader. The relatively young and economically nimble U.S. served as a refreshing replacement to the globe's former hegemon: a debt-ridden and war-torn Great Britain.
In addition to introducing a number of global financial agencies, the historic meeting also created an international gold-backed monetary standard which relied heavily upon the U.S. Dollar.
Initially, this dollar system worked well. However, by the 1960's, the weight of the system upon the United States became unbearable. On **August 15, 1971**, President Richard M. Nixon shocked the global economy when he officially ended the international convertibility from U.S. dollars into gold, thereby bringing an official end to the Bretton Woods arrangement.
Two years later, in an effort to maintain global demand for U.S. dollars, another system was created called the *petrodollar system*. In **1973**, a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the United States in which every barrel of oil purchased from the Saudis would be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under this new arrangement, any country that sought to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia would be required to first exchange their own national currency for U.S. dollars. In exchange for Saudi Arabia's willingness to denominate their oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars, the United States offered weapons and protection of their oil fields from neighboring nations, including Israel.
By **1975**, *all of the OPEC nations had agreed to price their own oil supplies exclusively in U.S. dollars in exchange for weapons and military protection.*
This petrodollar system, or more simply known as an "oil for dollars" system, created an immediate artificial demand for U.S. dollars around the globe. And of course, as global oil demand increased, so did the demand for U.S. dollars.
That is why we went after Saddam in Iraq, as he was switching from the USD FRN to the Euro in regards to the Petrodollar. 
Iraq was not about ordinary chemical or even nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The ‘weapon of mass destruction’ was the threat that others would follow Iraq and shift to euros out of dollars, creating mass destruction of the United States’ hegemonic economic role in the world.
Same thing with Gaddafi and Libya. 
If you wish to learn about fiat currency, which I know you won't (you probably won't even read this post) you need to grab a copy of the book I recommend in my aforementioned comment.

Most of their state actors operate outside of NK to execute their cyber-crimes, it's 101 to use a proxy and/or to travel outside of your region to perform your malicious attacks so it seems like another country is the source. 
Anyway, everybody knows the USD is the most favored form of currency for terrorism, sex trafficking rings, prostitution, drug trade, and all forms of organized crime. Did Obama pay Iran 130 billion in USD cash or was it BTC? The whole fucking point is moot. Currency is traded for goods and services, whether they are legitimate or illicit.

I said you would have to see the DOW at 5,000 for anyone to make such a claim, not record highs of 22,200. That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the current monetary system doing just fine.
Your comment almost feels like a copy and paste you've been saving to drop, it has no relevance to anything that I was talking about. Read the title of the thread and then I suggest you re-read what I said. It's pretty obvious to see I was referring to Kim Dotcom's superlative statement. If you don't know what the DOW is, Google it.

You're echoing pretty much everything I said lol. I said crypto isn't going anywhere and you will need fiat to obtain it.
I feel it's silly to give away a security that grows in value so exponentially. In my opinion, it would be better to hold on to it and utilize another crypto to spend on day-to-day needs. There will be a need for both uses. 
Again, that is why Charlie Lee created Litecoin, he viewed it the same way and that is why he created Litecoin. He has said so several times. He designed it to complement bitcoin.
This is just subjective vs subjective. Bitcoin can still grow as a storage of value. I would rather hold them and see what happens in the future than send them away. Every time I have I regret doing so.

That's great. There is no world wide adoption. That's what needs to happen before any current monetary financial system even is remotely close to crumbling. You've missed the point I was making.
It's kind of silly to spend btc as currency anyway until it has matured. 2013 if you bought something with 1 btc it was $13. Now it's $3000. Seems kind of silly, yeah? You paid a lot more for your product than you would have ever intended to.
Point is that the financial system that is in place is  nowhere near crumbling. The fact that you need fiat to obtain crypto is pretty important. Extrapolate. They will be used side by side.

Looking at NYSE as an example, when you have a company with solid metrics, the next place I look at is historic price movements. Been invested in Baidu since 2009 and a vast array of other companies just after the crash. Baidu split 10:1 after it reached $700+, currently trading at $236. FB was a no-brainer, I already knew it was a viable company. Been invested since the IPO at around ~$20 once it went public. I knew to avoid Twitter because I personally disliked Twitter and didn't see a purpose for it to exist. I also grabbed F when it was $0.98, C when it was at $3 after the crash, Google when it was $98. How did I know it would bounce back? Oh, by looking at the historic price movements before the market crashed, that helped me to assess fair value and to see how undervalued literally everything was at that time. That was the most relevant and deciding factor (historic price charts), as metrics had zero to do with the fall of every stock in the market. 
NFLX I thought was severely overbought and watched it rise and fall only to rise again. Got in late on that one, but I've made great gains as well. I utilize the pyramiding technique to compound investments by constantly adding to them. I buy and hold. I'm only telling you this because I am not some random Redditor that is Gung-ho about cryptocurrencies for arbitrary reasons, and I do have a little investing experience well before I entered the crypto market (eight years). 
I'm just speculating, sure. So far I haven't been wrong, but, there is always the chance the crypto could be locked into its own ecosystem if people do not adopt it. So, you'd essentially be unable to spend it in the traditional sense. However, it still has value as a p2p currency as long as people will accept it. People accept it because of the decentralized nature of the currency. However, I read a lot and, worldwide, I'm seeing adoption rise exponentially. It's a huge risk for big merchants and other mainstream components of retail infrastructure to adopt a new form of currency. This is not something that happens overnight. It will take many more years for that to happen. It's still in its infancy (cryptocurrency). 
Am I right to assume that you're saying Bitcoin will fall to $0 and have no value, essentially crashing? Are you only speaking about BTC or are you referring to cryptocurrencies in general? That is unclear, but it seems to me like you're only referencing Bitcoin. 
Blockchain technology is here to stay. It's a mathematical formula that is far superior and more secure than any protocol or platform ever-before used. Bitcoin ushered that into the world. 
I'm invested in cryptocurrencies, such as: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, OmiseGo, 0x, recently scooped NEO when it corrected to $18. I'm taking a risk but I don't really care since it's money I can afford to lose. When you buy any product, that money is gone. I've bought many things in my lifetime, so, money, as a general rule, is earned and then wasted. I see investing in anything no different than that if you can afford to throw it away. It's just money, you can always make more. And the USD FRN is ridiculous, most of the value is coming from the petrodollar via the Saudi Arabia deal and all other OPEC nations agreeing to peg the price of petrol to the USD. It hasn't been backed by gold since the Nixon Shock. Totally different from the start with the Bretton Woods agreement. Fiat currency is backed by nothing hence the term fiat. It is not backed by any commodity. It has value because of the psychology behind it and most people aren't even aware it's no longer backed by gold (double negative, sorry). It's really no different since humans assign arbitrary value to something which intrinsically lacks value to begin with, so, that whole psychological argument I suggest you put aside. 
Subjective vs subjective always ends up in circular dialogue. So, let's agree to disagree.

It's wise to put smaller amounts into your positions multiple times a week or on scheduled intervals, rather than 1 large lump sum, because of the volatility. Even investing 50% of what you intend to invest and then waiting for market conditions to change in your favor. I would just keep what you invested and throw a couple hundred at it (or whatever you can afford; more, less) every time you see the price dip. This is a technique called Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and a style called pyramiding. Just continously adding to your positions. 
Basically wait for huge price corrections to occur and then use those times to invest more heavily. That is the value investor approach. Pretty much like what you did today, but it was risky because of the current atmosphere with the China regulatory concerns. It could have dropped more and it still might. Sometimes you will see pseudo rallies and then the price will tank again. Bitcoin is still very much in an uptrend, though. Looking at the price chart, you can see prior to this week that a price correction was much overdue. 
The price can skyrocket or plummet in a moments notice.
I went to sleep when it was $2900. Awoke to a $3800+ price per BTC.
Drove to a friend's house. Arrived 10 minutes later. Checked price, it was $3500.
You need to know what the price oscillations are and then keep your eye on the cyclical occurrences. The price rises and falls like clockwork.
When you attempt to sell high there is always the possibility that it could skyrocket again shortly after you sell it and then you're in a worse position than when you started.
That's why I just buy and hold and stack my holdings by adding to them. 
Good luck!

vuR dope! And the description really completes it. Fantastic work. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:54:21
Wow that literally makes no sense lol. If you're paying in fiat, that is erroneous. If you paid $2000 you paid $2000. Fiat doesn't exponentially explode in value over the years
When you spend fiat. You can check your account ledger 10 years later and the price will relatively be the same. 
The *entire* point I'm making is that since bitcoin has yet to mature, expect to see more rise in valuation. Look at the historic price chart. 
When I bought some bitcoin to obtain a Trezor and sent that value to Trezor bc they forced you to pay in Bitcoin, that amount of bitcoin is now worth nearly $580. That is money that would have been in my account. This happened in a matter of a couple of months. 
Im not arguing about this lmao go ahead and send your bitcoins away haphazardly. You're silly, especially knowing the growth of the valuation on a year-to-year basis. 
Bitcoin has a limited supply of 5 million BTCs left with a 21 million cap. There are 7.5 billion people on the planet. Scarcity will continue to drive the price up in an exponential manner. 
I mean it's simple as hell. Back to my original hypothetical--if you would have chosen to not buy that TV and to hold on to the 153 bitcoins, you'd have $459,000 in Bitcoin. 
Oh wait, since I posted that, guess how much that valuation has risen since then?
153 bitcoin is now worth $579,870 
Do you not see the point I am making?? 
So in about 15 hours it has gained $120,000+ in valuation. 
gl hf sending your bitcoins away.

@_date: 2017-09-12 13:49:12
I'm looking at historical price charts which is one of the many factors an investor can look at to gauge value and growth. Your assumption that BTC future is dim is just as valid as my thinking it's bright. People will not (or rather, should not) use the currency until it reaches full maturity. You'd be foolish to spend it now. Why? Let's see. When you sent someone 1 BTC is 2013 it was worth $13. Now that 1 BTC is worth ~4K+-. So, people that thought it was cool to make online purchases with BTC because it was the first-ever cryptocurrency, well, don't they feel silly now (I know I would). Even currently, for example, the Subway in Czech Republic that accepts Bitcoin. Back in August when it dipped to $1700, up until now, pretty much any sandwich bought there has doubled in value or more. That original $6 purchase is now about $12. Overstock has been accepting BTC since 2014. They have made substantial gains.
Bitcoin is meant to be a storage of value, not a currency. That is where LTC comes in, it was specifically designed to complement and to be used alongside Bitcoin.
Fiat is necessary and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
Read this:
Note the date it was written. Very interesting read, and I had the same line of thought before I read this a few months ago.
Bitcoin is fueled by speculation by people like Mark Cuban that dont fundamentally understand it. The early adopters of the currency are not of the same mindset.
Any security by its nature is speculative, since the future is an unknown variable. However, as stated before, when you base your investments in, say, the NYSE or any market before the crypto market came to exist, it follows the same logic--you look at its fundamentals, cash flow, debt, and most importantly, historic price movements. That's why technical analysis is such an invaluable asset to those that know how to use such a tool. 
So, I disagree that looking back to gauge where it is going is erroneous. However, I do feel that a fairly significant pullback is due in the not-too-distant future, simply based on the near vertical chart line. When it does, I'll swoop in again just like the most recent $1700 dip. I'm a value investor. So, I buy and hold while waiting for big dips that happen two or three times on an annual basis.

Let's say you bought a $2,000 TV hypothetically in 2013. At $13/btc. That's 153 bitcoins you sent to buy something that costs $2000.
Here is the fun part for the merchant but the depressing part for the consumer. 
You just paid $459,000 for a TV.

Lmfao I'm sorry but nothing is crumbling. Not even close. Fiat is necessary to obtain crypto in the first place. Maybe when you see the DOW at 5,000 you can say that. Until then, thats just superlative nonsense. Crypto is here to stay but my goodness, come back to reality. You're not even seeing btc etc accepted here signs except in niche places here and there.

You're assuming he doesn't have other assets.
It's absurd to link a 50/50 chance coin toss with a security that has nine years worth of historical price movements.
It's pretty clear that the general direction of btc is in an uptrend and has been since its inception. Markets oscillate and there is volatility, but again, nothing is certain or promised in life.
Do you actually think institutional investors like Goldman Sachs play 50/50 with their billions that they've put into crypto, such as BTC?
Investing is not gambling.

It's clear if you look at the historic price movements nowadays that you should hold on to it as it continues to increase in value. That's the point I was making--it's not or shouldn't be treated as a currency bc of its exponential growth curve. Have fun spending your BTCs, I'll just hold them.

"The latest rave" you say?
Click the history tab.
Technical analysis used in conjunction with historic price movements has its place. There is a reason that it's relied upon in top investment firms worldwide. It's not stabbing in the dark, pulling arbitrary conditions out of your ass.
The historic price movements of BTC are showing it very may well hit a new ATH before retracing to $4200-4600 range.
Nothing is written in stone, but rather it is to be used as forecast *guidance*.
Look at the yearly chart, even on Coinbase, and it's clear to see that a correction is coming in the not-too-distant future. I generally utilize Dollar Cost Averaging and throw money at it on a set schedule, 1x week. Since it hit 5399 a few hours ago, I added to my positions at the dip. However, make no mistake, that was just a dip, not a price correction.
Sheba Jafari called the last huge dip in July when she said it would fall to $1700 and see a new ATH in August of 4000+. This was when BTC was selling at around 2800 to 3400 if I recall correctly.
I have been investing for a long time. Well before Bitcoin was around. To hear someone say that this is the "latest rave" only shows me that you have never invested before cryptocurrencies came into existence. The NYSE was founded in 1792. If you read the Wikipedia you'll see candlestick charting techniques came up around the ~18th century. That and many other forms of technical analysis really are nothing new. They just offer guidance. I will admit that a lot of times technical analysis won't be as applicable or as accurate for cryptocurrency securities in the short-term, especially for day traders, *but*, you can still utilize it. 
Markets and securities oscillate and operate on predictable, cyclical patterns. There is voluminous data available and a multitude of approaches one can adopt when utilizing technical analysis. 
All you really need is Bollinger Bands, MACD and a historical price chart and you can see what's going on. You need to keep up with the market in order to gauge what's happening relative to the past, especially previous quarters, and then you'll have a benchmark for what is fair value and when it's overbought/oversold.

Who said it would replace USD? Bitcoin is meant to be a storage of value. That's the exact reason why Charlie Lee created Litecoin--to complement Bitcoin and to be used alongside it as cash for day-to-day expenses. Once again, you will need fiat to obtain crypto. Bitcoin will mature when the remaining 5 million bitcoins are no longer available and the 21 million cap is reached. It is limited supply of 5 million with over 7.5 billion people on earth. Scarcity is what will drive up the price.

This started 1 week ago. Someone posted the HODL image. Someone said you couldn't make the shirt. I said watch me screen-print it. I then received replies from people saying they wanted some shirts. I offered to make 50 and give them away for fee. An hour later someone posted an Amazon link and sold the shirts. It wasn't "tryingtodoart". It was a random person that just capitalized on the trending thread. He took the shirt down because he got flamed and received 1 star reviews. 
That is the image this OP is referring to in this thread, "look what finally arrived..." the shirt from Amazon. 
I ordered one to see the quality. I knew it wouldn't be good, but it was actually horrible. That's my picture I posted in this thread above, showing how bad it is. A shirt like this needs to be screen-printed.

I'm not sure about Gemini or Kraken, but let's assume they also allow 15K/week
With 2 exchanges (coinbase + gemini), that would be 1.56mil/year that you could withdraw, taking 3.2 years total to withdraw 5 million.
With 3 exchanges (coinbase + gemini + kraken), that would be 2.34 mil/year you could withdraw, taking 2.1 years total to withdraw 5 million.
However, by this time there is a very high probability you'll have much more than 5 million worth in Bitcoin as the years pass.
If your bank gave you issue, you could open a new bank account for each exchange account.
You might even be able to link multiple bank accounts to one exchange account, but I have no clue. I'm a HODLer.

Let's say you bought a $2,000 TV hypothetically in 2013. At $13/btc. That's 153 bitcoins you sent to buy something that costs $2000.
Here is the fun part for the merchant but the depressing part for the consumer. 
You just paid $459,000 for a TV.

This is legit. Thanks for sharing. Sent to my mum. Along with Andreas, this is another good source to show to family members or friends who are still having trouble understanding what Bitcoin is all about. It's a brief overview but this will undoubtedly spark more interest to those who are curious to learn more about it. It helps when other advocates of established financial media outlets like The Wallstreet Journal and Bloomberg have honest, informed discussions about Bitcoin. Gets more mainstream everyday. Still a long way to go, but every bit of exposure helps.

August dip to 1700 flight to 4300
September dip to 2800 slow rise to 4800
October no significant dip, but slow crawl sideways then upward then sudden rocket to 5800+ 
Price correction is coming at some point. I think it will flirt with 6K, maybe reach 6400ish before a pullback occurs. 
I keep throwing a few 100 at it every time the price micro dips, 5400 and 5500. I have a large chunk I want to throw at it but I mistimed the September dip last time and got burned. Bought in at 3900, 5 mins later it gradually declined until it found support at 2800. Went to sleep, woke up next day it was at 3800. Drove to my friend's house, arrived 10 mins later it was at 3500. 
Based on the historic price movements, though, and the psychological effect of hitting new ATH, and the FOMO, and the Nov fork coming, this time might be a little different. 
We will see... 
Anyway, it's a cyclical occurrence. It travels in an upward trend, but the price oscillates--it's not a steady-state thing.

Yes, that is exactly what I mean. The assigned value of paper and computer code distributed across the internet both have no intrinsic value.
You're selectively picking something I said and not applying it to the comment I was responding to. I was essentially making the same point that fiat is just as viable as a cryptocurrency. The guy I was replying to was making it seem like you're safer in the stock market than you are with cryptocurrency investments, obviously not factoring in the crash of 2008 which devastated a lot of people's accounts.
Value is derived from the usefulness of a particular good or service when it is exchanged between parties. If there is a use and a steady supply and a demand for such a good/service, value can be pegged to it. 
Essentially value is subjective, albeit subjectivity might be on an incredibly large scale and the general consensus amongst individuals may almost lean toward an objective valuation which would be erroneous, such is the case with the USD FRN sovereign currency.

You could lose it (I've misplaced my phone several times), it could fall out of your pocket or it could get stolen. Either way it wouldn't matter as long as you have your recovery seed.

I'm assuming you weren't around in 2011 and don't know the most common place where BTC was transacted back and forth, yeah? Well, it's leaps and bounds beyond that now and it's a pretty big deal that even GS is giving cryptocurrencies time of day. When you take that little dataset and extrapolate, very low probability that as the months and years go by, that more institutional investors won't have an increased interest in the cryptocurrency market. Smaller guys and the bigger guys alike. They're just late to the party and will continue to sit on the fence until it breaks new ceilings and creates new baselines. Which is what it has been doing since its inception. It only took ceiling X to be reached after continuous breakthroughs for GS to become interested and "no longer ignore it" so the same mindset will happen and, pretty much is happening currently, to those that were on the fence that are now becoming involved in this particular market of the brand-new asset class.

Let me rephrase. He paid $459,000 in lost gains that he would have had. It's clear if you look at the historic price movements nowadays that you should hold on to it as it continues to increase in value. That's the point I was making--it's not or shouldn't be treated as a currency bc of its exponential growth curve. Have fun spending your BTCs, I'll just hold them. Make sure you keep track of every btc sent so you can see how much you would have had. Given the knowledge we now have, that it has risen so much... Again, quite silly to send them away.

Utilize Dollar Cost Averaging which is the practice of investing a set dollar amount on a set schedule (1x/week or 1x/month, whichever you can afford). This is the best way to combat the high volatility of cryptocurrencies.
Save some money to put aside for the big price corrections which happen like clockwork, then buy larger chunks. That is the value investor approach and it will create a margin of safety for you.
For instance, in August it was $3400 then fell to $1700 (perfect buy-in for the value investor) then it rocketed to $4300.
In September, it went from the $4300 range and fell gradually for a few days all the way to $2800 for an hour or so, where it found support. That was another great buy-in opportunity. It then spiked to $3800 the next day and traded within the $3500-4000 range for most of September, essentially trading sideways. 
In-between these big dips, throw $100 or so at it, whatever you're willing to invest (more, less).
Just remember the golden rule of investing: *never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.*
Eventually, at one point, owning 1 BTC may very well  be drastically unaffordable, so, just keep chipping away at it. Keep in mind it will once again have a significant drop, but don't panic, that's how BTC rolls. It's an emerging market and a brand-new asset class. It's extremely volatile. It can go down as much as it rises.

No problem. The one you picked up won't be screen-printed, though. It's mass produced just like the Amazon orders and quality will be subpar.
Also, there are 100s of types of cotton and thread count used and there is a reason when you pay $200 for a Bape shirt it comes in 100% cotton. Their shirts are too thick for my taste, personally, but they don't shrink hardly at all. Depends on what style and material you get, really. I've had Bape shirts for years and they hold up very well. Polyblends tend to tear easily in my experience, especially after being washed several times. I also don't like how sweat beads up on poly shirts, feels uncomfortable to me. Anyway, personal preference.

Yeah, you put that same dollar amount into bitcoin now and you won't get anywhere close to the amount of bitcoin you had purchased. That's why you HODL. After a certain point it will be drastically unaffordable. It's a global thing. Over 6 billion people around the globe have no access or very limited access to banking. Countries like Greece, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India, et al are experiencing hyperinflation with their sovereign currencies and Bitcoin is the only way out. Let's not even mention the limited supply. Make it a point to own 1 Bitcoin before it's out of reach. 2013 it was $13, a $2000 investment would have gotten you 153 Bitcoins--which is now worth $877K at the current price of $5733/BTC.
I still look at the one time I sent Bitcoin away to purchase a Trezor. That $120 is now worth $740. That really annoys me. I didn't want to do it in the first place but they're smart and would only accept Bitcoin lol. It's a necessary investment (hardware wallet), but I check the valuation every time the price goes up a good bit and it hurts to see what it's worth now lol. I essentially lost $740 in unrealized gains. It's like I bought 6 Trezors lol.

Yes, I'm aware all it takes is a bad news cycle which will temporarily create an immense buying opportunity for value investors like myself. I literally have been investing since 2009 and in Bitcoin since 2011. I never said I was going to be accurate. I'm basing this off of historical price movements.
On the contrary, tell that to the Goldman Sachs analyst, Sheba Jafari, whom accurately predicted the rise to $4000 in August. She said it would fall from $3400+ to $1700 and then exceed $4000. 
This was in July. It hit $4300 after August 17 I believe was the date. 
In September, we dealt with the Jamie Dimons and the China nonsense where it fell from $4300 to $3900 and continued to slowly decline for two days and found support @ $2800. This was a temporal event and it sat at that price point for an hour or so then bounced back to $3800 in about 12 hours and traded sideways for most of September until it started crawling back up. Then it jumped over $1200 to $5800+ in 24 hours and that's where we are now. Like I said, I think a slight price correction is coming sooner rather than later. We will see. I never set that in stone. Just a hunch. Based on its history. 
There are certain metrics at play with technical analysis that have their purpose and utility in order to accurately gauge market conditions. The price oscillates but the general trend has been traveling upward since its inception. I refer you again to the historic price charts. Granted, crypto is an emerging market so a lot of the same rules do not apply as they would in the NYSE.
I actually think it might break 6K and then fall a good bit or it could correct before it even hits 6K. That will only create more buying opportunities and people will buy more. 
You cannot ban Bitcoin. You can only stop people from using exchanges or depositing money to exchanges from bank accounts. Drugs are banned--how's that working out? People will just transact with cash peer-to-peer. The only thing that could truly stop it would be if the internet ceased to exist. That would prove problematic, to severely understate that scenario, since most of the world is reliant on it now. 
You have to factor in the 6.5 billion people around the *world* that have limited to zero access to banking. Bitcoin and other viable cryptocurrencies are a way for them to participate in the world economy like they've never been able to before.
Watch some of Andreas' videos:
If you study economics then you're familiar with Gresham's Law, which is what is currently happening in regard to bitcoin and other crypto assets.
I also suggest you familiarize yourself with a book called *The Creature from Jekyll Island* by G Edward Griffin, and also familiarize yourself with the Petrodollar if you're unaware. Hopefully, you're also aware of the Bretton Woods agreement and the Nixon Shock which is why our USD FRN is now a fiat currency backed by nothing. It is now backed by the military industrial complex/Petrodollar.
These are heavily contributing factors that will continue to drive the price of BTC up, but don't forget that this was the first-ever global currency and many other people outside of the Western world are also interested and participating in this brand-new asset class. Plus, the fact that there is only about 5+- million BTC left is also a contributing factor.
You should also know that it's simple economic math that if bitcoin market caps hits in the trillions it will equate to a 6 figure valuation.
Market cap in August was $45 billion. Current market cap as of October 15 is $96 billion. Market cap has more than doubled in two months. 
When you put all the variables together it's apparent that Bitcoin is devaluing sovereign currencies. That is what is actually playing out here. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:56:12
You're listening to a subjective opinion asking for other subjective opinions to counter a subjective vs subjective debate.
Formulate your own opinions and drown out everything else. Only way to fly. You only live once. Go ahead and sit on the sidelines until the point where 1 BTC will be drastically unaffordable, or utilize dollar cost averaging and throw a few hundred at it a week or each month (whatever you can afford). Just look at the charts from 2009 to present day. Kthx bye. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:19:03
You understand the USD FRN hasn't been backed by gold since the Bretton Woods agreement and the Nixon Shock, right? The only thing that gives it value is the psychological influence it has over people--they think it is backed by gold. That is why it is called a fiat currency. It's no more valuable than the paper it is printed on, essentially monopoly money. The "value" now comes from the Petrodollar. 
Over 6 billion people are experiencing no access to banking or very limited access around the globe. While several sovereign currencies from countries like Greece, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India, et al are experiencing hyperinflation. Bitcoin is the only way out for them.
No one should invest in anything unless it's money they can afford to lose. However, I would certainly suggest the DCA Dollar Cost Averaging approach to the hypothetical people in your aforementioned comment as a way to combat the volatility and to safely enter the crypto space.

The point is that despite all of that it's always in an uptrend.
It will retrace at some point. And that's when I will buy a shit ton.

That will just devalue the USD FRN further. Gresham's Law in action right now. People are exchanging their worthless fiat sovereign currencies into the stronger currency--BTC. People spend their fiat while BTC disappears from the economy and people use it as a stronger store of value. The valuation keeps climbing and it would be silly to spend it until it reaches maturity. 2013 = $13/btc; 2017 January = $620/btc. Market cap in July was 45b now we're at ~100b. 
The DOW went from about 14,000 in 2007 then crashed to 7,000ish in 2008. And now since the Trump economy is going ape shit we are seeing too many ATHs to keep up with and it's been less than a year. 19,000 to 24,000+ DOW. And that started in November, two months before he even got into office. The stock market has made $4 trillion+ in gains since Trump got into office. 
Crashes and bubbles are an inherent part of securities markets. They only provide buying opportunities for the value investor. Then they continue on and break through new ceilings as time progresses. It's a cyclical pattern.

Which operates on the Petrodollar via Saudi Arabia which we agreed to give military protection to and all OPEC nations agreeing to peg the price of oil to the USD FRN. 
Allow me to break it down for you:
In 1973, a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the United States in which every barrel of oil purchased from the Saudis would be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under this new arrangement, any country that sought to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia would be required to first exchange their own national currency for U.S. dollars. In exchange for Saudi Arabia's willingness to denominate their oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars, the United States offered weapons and protection of their oil fields from neighboring nations, including Israel.
By 1975, all of the OPEC nations had agreed to price their own oil supplies exclusively in U.S. dollars in exchange for weapons and military protection.
That's why the US military industrial complex went after Saddam when he switched to the Euro:
And also why they went after Gaddafi:
And that's also the reason the military industrial complex doesn't like Russia or China or Iran because they don't operate under the Petrodollar system

Don't listen to this guy. Dollar Cost Averaging is the practice of throwing a set amount of money at an investment on a set schedule (1x per week or per month, whatever you can afford). It's one of the best ways to combat the high volatility of cryptocurrencies. You can throw a large lump sum at it if you want, but it's smarter to keep a large chunk on hand for the significant dips, which happen like clockwork. Last big dips were $1700 in August and $2800 in September. That is the value investor approach and you essentially wait for a huge price correction to move into the investment in a big way--Warren Buffet style. I bought the August dip but mistimed the September dip. 
It's absurd that this guy is saying you wont make money unless you put $2500+ into bitcoin rofl.
Case in point: I bought 1BTC at $3900, next day it fell to $2800, next day it rose back to $3800 then fell to $3500 within 10 minutes. It's been climbing upward since. However, although the general direction is in an uptrend, along the way the price oscillates. You need to know the price movements in order to gauge fair value at any given moment. This is what should dictate your investment approach (DCA or just going all in, or halfway in, whatever). 
Sometimes I cut whatever I'm about to throw at bitcoin by 50% and wait to see what happens for a few days. sometimes I utilize DCA approach, and sometimes I throw larger chunks at it, depends on market conditions; if it's a really low price it's obviously better to buy larger chunks, if it's higher it can be better to utilize the DCA approach. But the entire point is to stack your holdings. It's called pyramiding.
Just keep throwing $ at it and HODL.
I bought a Trezor for $120 and that $120 I sent away is now worth $480. That annoys me. I don't like sending away BTC for this very reason. Especially when it was $13 in 2013. $2000 investment (153 BTCs) is now worth $795K. That's why you HODL. 
I just bought another $100 two days ago and it's worth $146 now.

I just get excited when prices plummet. I'm a value investor. In all markets there is always a sizeable price correction that devastates people and weak hands sell and the entire market panics. This happens a few times on an annual basis. Every few years, sometimes every decade, there is a massive crash that is the epitome of the phrase "buying opportunity". Those are the moments I wait for. Until then, I just stack cash on the sidelines and wait for that moment to occur, Warren Buffet style. In-between times, I just utilize the DCA approach. Ive found, especially with crypto markets, it's the best way to combat the extreme and oft-times unpredictable volatility of the market.

I said you would have to see the DOW at 5,000 for anyone to make such a claim, not record highs of 22,200. That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the current monetary system doing just fine.
Your comment almost feels like a copy and paste you've been saving to drop, it has no relevance to anything that I was talking about. Read the title of the thread and then I suggest you re-read what I said. It's pretty obvious to see I was referring to Kim Dotcom's superlative statement. If you don't know what the DOW is, Google it.

HODL. Lesson learned. $2000 investment in 2013  would get you 153 BTC. Now worth $849K at current price of $5500. Extrapolate...
Now look at this chart:
Extrapolate some more.
Did I mention to HODL?

No reason to carry the entirety of your crypto holdings on your person as your out and about. I'd recommend loading small amounts on your phone for day-to-day use when you go out if you plan on spending them locally.
