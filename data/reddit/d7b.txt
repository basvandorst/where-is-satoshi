how does one vote when running a full node? I run 3 but never understood this (sorry to all the people reading this in a huff and puff for me shining my ignorance like this...)

I have been holding and using btc since 2012 and love the project and people involved. I was mining shitcoins and flipping to btc to make a killing last year. Now i want to convert my mining farm to btc nodes to support the only project ibtruly believe in (under the assumption that hal finney was indeed satoshi and the genesis  wallet wont  be touched and will act as a source  of trust for the project. Huge assumption i know , but it makes sense that cypherpunks would have granted a fellow member privacy as a dying wish. I am guessing he would have demanded it. Also, as a fellow programmer, the first real tx is ALWAYS the main developer). Btc and monero are the two coins that make sense to me. Will continue to support, so thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:45:36
Thanks you so much for this. This makes perfect sense and proves me to be the brainlet I am. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:09:34
Very True. The only use of lightning is the speculative marketing value of it. That may be good for the price of BTC in the near (?!) future but will all these things, I will believe it when I can use it. (Yes, I am on the testnet network already)

Thabks mate. Got you loud and clear re BIP number. Ill check out the config number tonight.

Yes, which is why they went broke

No excuse . I re read things ten times before I post anything high
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:33:21
The more important question is why do people hoard such enormous amounts of BTC edit: typo
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:57:17
Nope, I just have never been impressed with this guy. Buffett commenting on technology is like hearing Donald trumps opinion on theoretical physics

So this paragraph makes sense to you ?

Nope. Pretty sure your electricity price will outweigh any gains

Says a toxic old man who technically doesn’t create anything. Who cares 
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:38:45
i diversified for that exact reason. who knows what could happen and what coin might be taken up by an investor or regime. will one coin be adopted or a new . gov  or corp one established (like Mr Robot - e coin) 
i have read positive things about ETH technology. ill have to read into it more to see why it is seemingly superior 
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:07:01
awesome! thanks for the meaningful response. something to research off here... and seemingly a very important advantage of Ethereum. 
i might up my holding... 
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:55:42
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:54:03
trader as well and sadly virtually no clue about the technokogy behind ETH sorry. I just diversified massively with all coins due to a hunch that if it happened with LTC and BTC it could happen again with any coin. my strategy is more of a 'fashion' approach being influential with coin value growth as much as the technology backing their protocol. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:29:01
but yes... mid twenties vs mid 1200s is a very different ballpark
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:25:49
etc and ltc both made me a lot
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:25:05
I have a massively diverse coin collection. almost like an pseudo index fund altcoin collection incase some other coin takes off.  btc and ltc and eth are the only coins that have made me serious earnings.  i started in 2011 as well. 
Im doubting there is very little actual innovation occuring and just countless copies with different names based on near identical frameworks. 
Just hustling to make money off any coins that offer that possibility again, as im dubious of anything more cutting edge than BTC itself honestly developing but needless to say am all ears sir! 
the only reason i am interested in cryptocurrency in my investment is due to a small fortune i made with BTC speculation. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:49:33
i find people who talk about a potential switches and rushes to altcoins are wishful thinkers who missed out on BTC fortune and bought altcoins and are begging for a similar rise to occur. probably the people that still balked at litecoin but are now waiting with baited breath with dogecoin or some garbage hoping for some miraculous and undoubtedly never to occur rush
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:04:07
i can imagine a professional investor would scour every single possible data source paying close attention to peer reviewed content (whilst also being super cautious at the same time) 
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:11:22
The insight is that 99% of what we read on the net is speculative bullshit from people who are too dumb to realise you can't play the world for Fools
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:32:18
yes, it is easy and exactly like all the instructions highlight. 
save your electrum wallet, transfer your BTC to a new wallet, download and install electron-cash, open existing wallet / import private key into new electron-cash and put in your password. You will then see your transaction history with the BCC or mBCC (if you havent changed settings) in this instance of electron-cash wallet.
note: as per many suggestions i deselected auto-select server and used a trusted BCC server in the server tab ( of the network settings)
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:39:14
i read about that as well and was hesitant in doing this for hours . finally bit the bullet and absolutely no issues. I think the deselect of auto connect and server specification is the part overlooked creating issues.
cool username btw. haha
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:35:37
Don’t hassle the cashies. This is all they have 
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:15:21
Roger?what idiocy seriously. It’s like Mercedes Benz owners going livid if somebody called their car a Merc . Cashies are criminal filth. That is also unfalsifiable, sadly for them.

Gambling is one of the finest things a man can do (with his BTC)... But it if he is good at it ;-)
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:21:07
Definitely. But a few rinky dink noname dealers isn't exactly hundreds of millions of dollars embezzled from a countries population. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:44:22
really starting to notice this now. I have NEVER had slow transactions until the past 3 days. its almost unbearably bad. 
If people start to notice this I'd say the price of BTC will crash. This is garbage
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:33:55
Logic prevails
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:55:24
I hadn't! I'd been lucky af it seems and now world's are colliding. I know people are thinking in an anti BTC shill but I am not. I love BTC. It made my living for life . I fucking owe it everything.
But 24 hours for a transaction? Pass...it no longer serves it's function.
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:01:09
I agree. I found academia to be counterproductive​ to development.

Agreed. The whole attempted murder charge is as good as fabricated .They just did it as a more solid charge whilst throwing the book at him.
Im not saying the dude isnt an idiot. I would never be able to sleep running a site that solicited so much illegality even though I am a liberatarian. 
Basically, he ran a risk with a know quantity for punishment. Everybody knew life is what this would yield. 
What he is doing though is the future. As we know with scientists being labelled heretics in the past and punished me know Ulbricht was well ahead of his time.

They threw it out and restructured it, so the currency didnt survive at all.

Don't worry man, Aussie dude here sick of this high and mighty attitude displayed on a daily basis by Reddit users. He was shut down for being negative and is having a cry... The old 'you wouldn't hit a man with glasses!' trick. This doesn't reflect on joecoins professionalism. Wtf...
You can't as a business operator but I can. Y'all are fucken cunts. Stick your negative comments up your high and mighty asses . Wichser... (Bin in .de aufgewachsen und liebe Eure Land! Berlin ist such mein lieblings Stadt der Welt! Werder naechsten Mal besuchen. Peace alte! Haha)
