Who is currently using bitcoin?

I've never bothered with making quick bucks by selling highs and buying dips. Just not my style.
Today I said fuck it. 
FUCK. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:40
Right? People singing those kind of praises seem to have been fucking way out of the loop for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:41
If we’re talking about crypto currency in general here, then yeah, I 100% agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:28
Where was I being a condescending prick? It was a legit question. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:36:11
Holy shit. 4 billion? Where can I read up more on this?
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:07:34
Makes sense, thanks
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:07:21
Thank you!
And yes, a few months ago I bought an amount of bitcoin that I could afford, and just a few days ago bought a chunk of ethereum I could afford.
And since then I have been learning what I've been able to learn about all of this stuff. Thank you for the warm welcome

Where can I learn about bitfinex and fiat?
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:18:38
How come?
(I'm terribly new to bitcoin. Trying to learn everything I can, which includes asking questions)

Tell that to the black market industry that spent $$$$$$$$$$$$$ in bitcoin over the past so many years. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:23:11
I've heard about that. What are some examples?
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:28:31
I am using Jaxx. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:10:23
I'm now 2 days past the pending due date. I am very uneasy. This sucks hard.
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:59:55
Thanks. I am looking into creating cold storage now also. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:32:46
I don't want to. But I HAVE made withdrawals from Coinbase, and I am confused/concerned why this guy is saying you can't. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:33:06
I doubt it. 
Don't stress too hard on coinbase's issues and the complaints here (even though I agree with them), and don't stress too hard on BTC softening up just as it has.
Be satisfied you are sitting on 1.5K worth of btc and eth and adopt the mentality that you're in this for the long haul. Congrats on holding coin. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:51:04
Will do. And thank you. I'll be checking throughout the day 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:27:18
Correct me if I am wrong. But, from the perspective of what you just posted, are you not erroneously boiling down ETH to be comparable to BTC as a simple currency? To my (limited) understanding, does not ETH have value in that it is a tool/resource to be used in a blockchain process? While BTC is, essentially, a currency that the global community has placed monetary value on?
EDIT: I am just trying to learn, please comment instead of downvoting. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:06:15
Wait. Are you saying that is not possible? Why wouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:39:17
Holy shit this argument kind of started relevant but devolved into an argument about nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:48:07
I also bought Trezor straight from their website. 
I got my BTC onto it no problem. My ETH on the other hand was...cumbersome, but it seems all good and there.
I have to be 100% honest though, I used to feel a LOT more safe holding my coin on my Jaxx wallet on my iphone. I realize trezor cold storage is safer but...it just feels...weird.

As said, it is "running uphill", not a picture of a free fall.
