They don't just print new money (it's not tether lol), it's coming from taxpayers. And the government will get some of it back from the bank liquidation process. Bank going bankrupt doesn't mean it has no assets (like issued loans).
Sure, a bank going bust is not great, but for the clients it's mostly just a mild inconvenience, unlike when unregulated crypto exchange goes tits up or ICO company operated from other side of the world exits with "penis" displayed on its webpage and there is nothing you can do.

For vast majority of people - nothing, you just receive your money at a different bank a few days or weeks later. At least in EU all bank deposits up to 100 000 EUR are guaranteed by government.
If you have more than 100k sitting in single bank account, then you may lose some of it (not always), but very few people hold over 100k in cash for long, it's kind of stupid. And you can spread your money across multiple banks if you really want to keep a lot in cash and have it all government insured.
I don't know much about US laws, but google search returned me this, so it seems it's even more in the US:

If you compare electricity price from the grid vs fuel price, taking into account engine and alternator efficiency, I can bet the electricity in the truck is significantly more expensive than at home.

Well technically 5001 also rounds to 10 000 if you round it to whole 10-thousands.
