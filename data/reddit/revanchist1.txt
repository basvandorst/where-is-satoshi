Awesome, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for taking the time to write it out and linking. This sub seems to be mostly about price and memes and I could barely find any actual development posts.
The first article mentions smart contracts. How functional would the smart contracts be? From reading the article, I'm presuming the layer 1 application would be limited and simple. Would Bitcoin ever be able to add the functionality and depth of smart contracts found in other coins(create tokens) on a second layer and settle on layer 1. 
Is anything in the works for that?

Nothing is stopping a business from obliging to the government audit and also providing an audit from a private 3rd party company for their customers (unless it explicitly says so).

In the developed world,one of the killer appa is for people without credit cards (low credit score, non-existent credit score) to buy items from online marketplaces; or even under aged kids (16-17) doing odd jobs, who are unable to obtain credit cards, to purchase things online. That's an entire untapped marketplace.

Are you serious? If Mt Gox were operating under this framework, they would have been shut down almost immediately and would have only been allowed to resume business if their systems were up to par (which clearly they weren't, seeing that many claimed their systems were horrid). This framework would have called for Mt gox to perform periodic audits to make sure the customer funds are indeed still in the system preventing MtGox from claiming a flaw in bitcoin's protocol caused them to lose millions of dollars worth of bitcoins...along with many other problems mtgox and customers faced.
It might have not been fully prevented but it surely wouldn't have been as bad as it was.
I really don't understand what's wrong with this sub. A sizable amount of users want "Wall street" to enter and then they complain when steps are taken to allow Wall street to enter.

Okay, after further reading I do see how this is a threat bitcoin. I was initially thinking about it only from an exchange point of view and not from the overall ecosystem. The regulations imposed on wallets and services dealing with bitcoins is overstepping it along with the creation of alt coins (who even asked for regulation dealing with the creation of alt coins?) The language used in the document is very broad and not specific enough, which is what i guess they were going for.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:50:18
That's pretty interesting that you mentioned it. Maybe those posts have been sticking out in my head more. But i could swear anytime a company adopts bitcoin, Barry talks about Second Market, and Winkle twins talk about their etf, a sizable amount of comments mention the influx of money from wall street. 
The thing is Bitcoin is still free from wall street activity. Bitcoin still operates like it always has. If you want to send money without any middleman you can still do so. Bitcoin is still the decentralized pseudonymous currency it always has been. The protocol is and cannot ever be regulated and that is the major point. There are two groups of users (with many shades of gray between), those who want widespread adoption and those who want the original vision of bitcoin of being a currency free from the "system". In a perfect world we would get the latter but we don't live in a utopia and if users want bitcoin to expand and give financial freedom to those outside the banking system they will have to make some compromises.

From my understanding, he was hired to offer advice IF asked. He wan't in charge of the entire platform. I feel any confusion with his exact purpose with Neo&amp;Bee should be blamed on Brewster for marketing Andreas' name in a way that suggested that he was deeply involved with Neo &amp; Bee. 
If anything, Andreas probably saw Neo &amp; Bee as way to introduce bitcoin to a sizable population (like many of us) and offered his help if they needed it.

From a user/customer standpoint it's really not that unreasonable, if you plan on dealing with a sizable amount of money/digital currencies. Keeping record of 10 years is not hard, if anything it is recommended if they don't want to face any legal repercussions from users of their service. Fingerprints of those in charge of dealing with users money is also reasonable, especially if you don't want people running off with your digital currencies. This is only reasonable for services that market themselves as Exchanges, Trusts, and wallets NOT for regular store owners who decide on accepting bitcoins.
I'll continue on to read the actual document. However if a license, fingerprints, and AML/KYC requirments is required for even accepting bitcoins; i.e Ma and Pa shops, food stands, etc. that is clearly over doing it.

The license limits the amount of players in the field by weeding out those who are in it for a quick profit and decide to run off with your coins. It sets a precedent for those who are really interested in making a business around their service and those who just *feel* like they can do a good job.

I believe there aren't a lot of panic sellers. Those who are selling are most likely day traders. If a "ban" notice comes from China, my guess is people will sell not because of panic but because they predict others will sell in the hopes of getting cheaper coins (a self fulfilling prophecy), basically they are shorting bitcoin. They can then pick up extra coins at a lower price they deem fit (where there is a lot of buying resistance)and wait for the price to rise quickly again (as we saw when the price rose to $550) and short because such a rapid rise in price in a short amount of time, combined with the bear market we have been in for a while, is bound to correct itself.

When mining becomes unprofitable for miners they will turn off their miners. When enough of the miners do this, the difficulty will decrease causing mining to be "easier".  Not sure why you are getting worked up over this fact.

I feel a major problem with people researching Bitcoins is the fact that almost every website introduces the concept of mining. While it was possible earlier it is not possible for a random joe to get in on mining this late and make any foreseeable profit/Bitcoins. We should at least put it in the sidebar that mining while possible is not recommended for obtaining Bitcoins. But that's just my opinion on the situation. There are a few links that should definitely be stickied or put somewhere in the sidebar for people getting into Bitcoins. 
**Getting Started With Bitcoins** (I feel this is a better link than the one in the sidebar)
**For a secure Wallet** (Both Paranoid way and Easier Way) wrote a great tutorial (Although I'm not that tech savy so I'm not so sure how secure it really is)
For How to Purchase Bitcoins links to exchanges and localbitcoins should suffice
That's just my 2 cents. I am open to discussion if anything I said was wrong seeing that I am fairly new to bitcoins.
Also if there is a , there should be a link to that as well for people to post their complaints or compliments. 
EDIT: Also it would be disrespectful to not put: 
**Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**
Was surprised that a lot of people did not read this before, even after doing a lot of "research".

In order to enter/fund WWI, America needed to drastically print money which wouldn't be possible if the money was backed by gold. I wrote a paper on it but can't seem to find it anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:58:35
Alright I'll try to explain some terms, but be warned I may be wrong on some of them. 
To own bitcoins (if you are in the US) just use coinbase (for online purchases) or use localbitcoins website for person to person bitcoin transactions.
There are other alternatives to coinbase, but I found their setup and interface to be the easiest to use. After you have purchased any amount of bitcoins and after all the payments are cleared (5-10 days) you will own your first portion of BTC's.
Coinbase will automatically generate a wallet for you and it will be stored on/in their systems. However, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for you to transfer those BTC's to a Paper Wallet (I'll tell you about this later). 
Why you may ask? 
Well, what were to happen if Coinbase was hacked? I presume BTC's would be stolen from a number of accounts. It is better to have your BTC's in your hands on not in the care of some 3rd party. 
A **Paper Wallet** is not what it sounds like? A paper wallet can be on paper, I believe there are also computer Paper Wallets but they require a computer that has never been online...an "internet virgin". A **Paper Wallet** really is a wallet that has never touched the internet. Depending on how paranoid you are about your funds being stolen you can use different types of security with regards to passphrases and encryptions. But just use the link about Secure paper wallets and scroll all the way down to find the easy way to have a relatively safe wallet that is not in the hands of a third party.
Now you may notice that there are two keys associated to your Wallet. A **Public Key** and a **Private Key** both are a long series of numbers/letters...
**Public Key** - You can post this anywhere you want, whether it be online or in a bathroom stall. This is used to receive funds. If you need to borrow a millibit from someone you would give them this key and they can send you the funds to finance your exciting life.
**Private Key** - This is for you and **ONLY** you to know. This key is what allows you to send and spend the BTC's associated with the **Public Key**. If someone gets a hold of this they would have unlimited access to your wallet. 
**Electrum** is a Bitcoin client. It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart. I am still trying to understand what it does but as of now it seems to only be important if you store your wallet on a computer.
