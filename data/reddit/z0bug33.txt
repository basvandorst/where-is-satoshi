to be fair, the real liquidity is low. most coins are being HODL'ed

weak hands panicking. They think that the futures market has a tangible effect on bitcoin (hint: it doesn't , but because enough people believe it does it seems to have one). The futures market doesn't even touch bitcoin, it just really bets if it goes up or down. it is akin to bookmaking odds having a tangible effect on the sports team winning, that and we are due 1 final dump before the bull market can resume in earnest

I don't disagree with you, but manipulation can only occur if you get manipulated (duh). I'm not the brightest spark around, but it doesn't feel inherently right that what is essentially a bet on an occurrence can have a tangible effect on the probability.  Maybe the market might reverse at 1600 GMT (i hope so) but it's dumping right now so it could be possible.

futures has only caused uncertainty and depress prices thus far

that was confirmed false. The Mark Karpeles AMA confirmed that the trustee has the mandate to sell more coins if he wishes
