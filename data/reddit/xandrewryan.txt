Yes but this is a rare short term occurrence in the us. If it were widespread and constant, it would be changed or revolted against, ideally.

That is pretty messed up. Something needs to be done about it. If it gets out of hand the natural democratic process will resolve it by demand, typically. The government doesn't usually overtly do crazy crap to a whole bunch of its citizens to screw them over all the time. It wouldn't necessarily get away with it in the long run because people would elect representatives or enact legislation to change it.

Everything the government et al are doing is slow, however people will *demand* their rights be taken away over the coming decades for one manufacturer reason or another. People purchase GPS tracking and self-surveillance devices for 800 dollars. They demand censorship and imprisonment. People are cows.

You're not seeing the big picture. If the u.s. ever came to a place where police were en mass imprisoning civilians, robbing people, etc, it should follow that arm bearing citizens would form militias to fight the police and military.

What money grubbing, gold hoarding, international banking system owning, federal reserve operating, jeweling group of people might be responsible for this, you might wonder? Humans. Checkmate,  bigots.
