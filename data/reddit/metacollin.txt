If consensus matters to you, look at this thread.  **The consensus of this community is that the rules for this subreddit be changed.** 
This situation is unique, as the 'just make your own subreddit' argument doesn't work.  This subreddit holds the name of something, and will always be seen as the 'official' community and the one that new users will be coming to. 
Are you here for this community? This community has **overwhelming consensus**, and at the very least, based on the one-sidedness of the comments in this thread, you would at least need to create a community vote. 
I say, to be perfectly, utterly clear: **The rules by which you are moderating are forcing a non-consensus policy upon this community, so by the justification for the enforcement of your own rule, you need to change that rule, or at least hold a vote for it to be changed.**
Please explain why you are not doing that, or how you reconcile your justification with your total disrespect for the consensus of this community.  That's a request - I nor anyone else can force you to do anything.  But if you feel the need to respond to this or not will, one way or another, demonstrate your true motivations (whatever they may be). 
I really hope those motivations are to work with this community, because this is not 'your' subreddit.  It's ours. Yours as well as the rest of the community's.

Er, no, it isn't a strawman.  What you just did however, is.  
A strawman argument is intentionally misrepresenting the argument of another.
Pointing out the obvious and indisputable whataboutisms in the video is not misrepresenting anything.  He even says, 'how about...'.  It's just another way of saying 'what about..'.  
However, misrepresenting point as itself being a misrepresentation, and offered zero reason or explanation behind it.  At the minimum, you need to explain how exactly the whataboutisms in the video are somehow not, but just seem exactly like them.  
I just explained why your argument actually ***is*** a strawman.  
Either explain yourself or GTFO.
