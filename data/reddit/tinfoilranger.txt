This article is a load of horse shit.
They say the gold is being used by drug lords to launder money.
Then they say that the gold is plated metal.
Why would drug lords buy fake gold bars?
The actual issue is that the gold wasn’t minted in an official refinery. And the refineries have got their panties in a twist because they can no longer control the supply of gold because people are making their own gold bars and that’s fucking with the refineries ability to limit availability and thus control the price.
Fuck this article and whoever wrote it.
Regardless of my points above, this still means good news for bitcoin.
