I doubt there will be any useful assets, that will trade with an TOR-only coin/marketplace/ecosystem.
Look at deep market business/economy now, it's 99,99% drug market, extortion, child porn &amp; trading of not legal virtual goods (hacked or phished credentials, credit card data, ...).
No one of these deep market business operators will start (&amp; maintain) a useful, investworthy sustainable asset.

I think these bigger players who "Dump and buy back" as main strategy are really harming by increasing volatility and hinder any organic, fact-based price development.
If u observe BTC-related trading discussion, u notice that is strategy is very, very common and accepted now. 
(Even by people who are community mebers since 2010 and year long called them selves never-selling "HODLers"  etc. / I also noticed even more and more Bitcoiners with small holdings like 1 BTC to 10 BTC are starting with this BS. People who never traded before.)
Alot of these guys are Bitcoin Early Adopters or people who own for whatever alot of BTC and used to be "normal community members"
==&gt; solid share of the market rigging is coming from inside the BTC community (and not "enemies" like Govts. outside)
Maybe hard to public acknowledge, but this is the truth.

You have great drugs, bro.
