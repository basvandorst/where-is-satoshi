Hedged for a dip on my coin at 10.7 I'm down nearly 1000 please go back to 10.7 so I can have a full coin again .89 of a coin will make me cry :(

Sold 1 @ 10.7 Friday and it went up stubbornly waited for it to return I got close 9.97 for 10.7 2 days ago and dropped another $300 to get the extra .04 it will drop down after it hits 12.5 on the next few hours I'm just not hedging again cost me $300 to get to the same positron. And I lucked out with a nice dip I was looking at $1100 loss for most of the last 3 days.

Sold at 12.8 boom coming back in at 11.9
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:15:20
It will hit 12.5 or 12.6 tonight and then dip to 11 something in the next 2 hours.   Just hit 12345 ATH that looked cool as hell 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:16:04
Boom  look at that sale
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:39:51
During that mad dip I transferred back in for .97 I am happy with that thank god not my 1.006 but not as bad as .89 at the worst last night. Now I need another dip to by .03  
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:46:29
Let's see how it looks in 8 hours either way I still have 15k not bad from a 7k buy. It would suck to own less than a coin when I buy back though 1.006xxx lol it's silly but it took ages to get 1 I only wanted to get 1 just to be in the club. Nap time!

Bitfx does 60% of trades they are at 12.8 don't use edge cases unless you can see local fiat representations without fees on instant trades if you see bitfinex hit 13 after hitting 12 only hours earlier and don't take the chance to grow your stack you are mad. Bitcoin dips once after a big unit surge (1000 + 1000) then punches through on the rebound. Don't think a second dip is coming there will only be one it's + or _ 45 minutes from a trip to low 12 or high 11 US. That's a ball guarantee!

the day bitcoin hit 11k my 1.006 was worth 15k AUD I was going to put into my my hedge account and buy back on the dip I didn't and my value went down to 13k now it's hit 15k again I immediately dumped into hedge at about 10.7k usd it's midnight Friday Aussie time I'm going to bed and will by again in 10 hours at 9k usd..... I hope
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:12:13
Ouch .73 is like 3/4 of my stack hopefully you have a bigger pile than me. Did that sour you on the experiance and you just HODL now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:20:38
How long till the dip I'm going to bed I set an alarm for 4 hours

 Bitfinex does the greater % of trades so I feel when they hit 20k that's when it truly hits 20k give it another 20 minutes chief :)

They have a pile of fiat and someone gives them more to take a short position. If the price goes up the client losses money if it goes down they (CME) lose some of there stack. They don't even have to hold coin just be associated with it because it's the new cool thing for casuals. They are a casino basically pouring a tiny part of there overall wealth to get into the cool club. They either lose a little money or get to shout from the roof tops that they were on the cutting edge.

Of course HODL but I am an idiot and now instead of having 1.006 BTC if I trade back I will have .968 BTC because I was held when it 11K last week (when I wanted to dump and by the dip) I didn't do it then and was so annoyed at myself so I did it this time and look to be learning a $200 to $400 lesson! Im holding off buying back in until tomorrow morning HODL the hedge bring back 10.5K I have bitcoinity open I am really enjoying my Saturday.
Does anyone recommend a android tracker ticker app thats like bitcoinity?
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:20:51
You were so fucking right man kudos on a solid call. I'm holding until 10.5 or taking a bath and rebuy at 11.5
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:11:24
Transferred my coin to fiat at 10.7 expecting a dip and it's nearly 12 I can only by .9 of a coin now diving fucking kicking myself
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:32:50
Bought and held for a long while then got the urge to turn my 1 into 1.3 got back in at .97 thanks to a generous dip that at its worst would have seen me back in at .87 of a coin. Bought the extra to get me back to one coin for $300 and haven't looked back holding hard currently have 8k AUD invested between BTC and LTC with a Delta app value of $27.7k AUD total just buy and hold don't Fuck about. If your worried take out your initial stake + tax and hold the gains. You can't win the game when you are not playing it!

@_date: 2017-12-02 00:27:46
God darnit I cashed out to hedge account 10.7 last night expecting a drop and it keeps going up I keep thinking it can't hit 11 surely. If I hedge back in now I will only have .97 of a coin that will be like having a rock in my shoe.

What the hell are you doing on the site buying and swelling every 5 minutes? You don't need to live on the site to check prices and you shouldn't have much money on there in the first place? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:10:46
Every discreet interval of 1000 since 6 has seen a push towards the next interval of 1000 within 2 days sometimes like 10k 11k was hit just hours after. 12k will approach 12.7 _ 12.8 and then dip to 11.2 _ 11.5

@_date: 2017-12-03 20:33:00
I didn't do it the first time and missed the dip then when it hit 10.7 again I sold and it's just gone up ever since. I could have bought on at .99 btc but wanted a whole coin so I held off. Now my stack can only by me .90 of a coin I'm down 1000 from what I'd have if I did nothing. I'm holding under 10900 then buying back in.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:40:25
I should of held like the Spartan but I tried to make a quick .1 btc around 7 hours from now is the topical low daily time historically I'll attempt to minimise my harm then. Had I have done nothing and held I'd be up nearly $800 local currency. My prediction (guess after landmark meme hits) was right but not this time.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:40:54
Pretty much this. A little over 8 hours ago I wrote this. (the day bitcoin hit 11k my 1.006 was worth 15k AUD I was going to put into my my hedge account and buy back on the dip I didn't and my value went down to 13k now it's hit 15k again I immediately dumped into hedge at about 10.7k usd it's midnight Friday Aussie time I'm going to bed and will by again in 10 hours at 9k usd..... I hope)
 I'm going to keep my 10.7k in hedge fiat account for another 24 hours and hope to see 9 again or at least low 10 we can't be ready for 11 proper yet!
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:54:23
I would be surprised if we hit 11 and stay but don't expect 9 just low 10's. I put 6.9K AUD into my coin this year and have 15.2 in a hedge account which is my cash. I will happily buy .9 of a coin and add more over the following days I am just enjoying the fun of it all. I do feel a little odd not having my coin though.

My point .88 was worth 9k aud 4 days ago. Then it was worth 8 and I paid 1.1k to get up 1. Btc now that's worth 8.5k. I should have sold at the high and saved myself another wasted 1k. I've invested 7k for a value of 8.5

I have nearly 1 btc on coin jar they don't give any b2x at the split. Coin base will give you one b2x for every btc you have literally doubling your money and they do it automatically. You can then all the b2x and buy btc I don't see how you can do that feature with keys and wallets when you only have one wallet. No one can explain if I take my coin of the exchange how I then get it from the piece of paper back to and exchange. You are safe leaving your 200 there!
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:39:09
Probably like 50k then I lose 25% to tax
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:26:01
I'm really considering transferring my btc to fiat within my account as soon as it goes to 10k then transferring it all back into btc when it dips. Might make a few 10ths if it actually dips. 10k has to be like the physiological 1k hurdle that dipped btc 2/3rds if only I have the balls to unhodl. I hate that this is going to be on my post history....

One of my investments was hit with a class action it was a rental company that apparently catered to get credit risks knowingly. And another was a powdered milk company sure to make a killing as China loosened its one child policy and constructed new production facilities to provide baby milk products to Chinese infants. China said Fuck you no we will not accept imports of powdered milk we will construct our own facilities. The real kicker I paid $300 the price of 1 btc at the time to get access to this web services list of premium "go buy these stocks" absolute fucking moron. I researched myself and selected some stocks I had interest in and thought sounded like good promising companies and put in another 12 grand. I'm up about 12 percent overall on those in the last year but that's not btc increases. I invest in stocks, old technology video games and unique hardware. Specialty knives, antique furniture, old vehicle parts (really old) and real estate. It's really hard to give an entire portfolio the attention it deserves when crypto is crushing everything. But I try

On the 8th of December 2015 I paid $300 to join an online stock market advisory then invested 12k in 6 different stocks. I had spent the weekend at a wedding with a bunch of investment knuckleheads who told me my idea to plonk it into btc was stupid. I left it and watched. Now my stocks are worth $6900 in the interim I have 1 btc that cost me around $3400. Btc was around $384 the day I purchased my stocks. What would I want a 1/4 of a million dollars for anyway. Current stock value $6900 current btc value $8000. I opened my coin base account Dec 15 2013 when btc was worth $800 I was given .01 of btc just for opening the acct.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:36:59
I bought 12k in stocks 4 years ago after being pushed off btc it's worth 6 at the moment and I've held them selling is a very scary concept. But if I've doubled my money and sell then it doesn't dip I buy back in and take a small loss. Shirley there's not a mass of buy orders at 10k ...

So I have my coin 1.1 stored on coinjar (AUD) coinjar says they are doing nothing with regaurds to forks and they have my private keys which means they are basically getting the forked coins from everyone storing money in coinjar wallet? at 1.1 btc or about 8200 AUD I am wondering how much I could earn if I get access to my keys by transferring my coins out of coinjar somehow then trading the b2x to btc. I was reading about an exchange that at the time of the split gave users the same amount of splitcoin as BTC. Is there any exchanges that are doing that? IE I transfer my coins to another exchange the for happens they give me free new coins which I dump for BTC and then I can transfer my coins back to coinjar (or just keep it on the new exchange if thats better than Coinjar) does that make sense. The whole getting you keys thing then transferring the split coins is doing my head in.
