Same.  Been holding since 2010, before hodling was a thing.
This one was easy compared to the ones in the past.  I had absolutely zero interest in selling this dip.  
Experience matters in cryptocurrency.  You can't really be "educated" on hodling, its just one of those things where you have to have the experience.

Everything seems broken at coinbase and gdax right now.  
Server overload. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:22
No, it shows up automatically.
I even got a popup explaining that it had automatically been placed in my coinbase account, when I logged into coinbase a little while ago.

Just now?  
Coinbase/GDAX is having an all hands on deck moment.  
I'd hold off on doing anything if you can, until they get it a little more stable. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:04:54
Seems $3,700-$4k is where BCH wants to stabilize. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:25
Awesome, thanks for the site.  Had never seen that before.
Well, son of a bitch.  I wish a higher fee had been used.  
Any idea what fee coinbase uses when they send coins to you, or is it a dynamic fee depending on market conditions?

Haven't read a news story in 2 years?
Assange literally said the opposite of what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:05
Pretty much.  
In investment terms, think of it as a dividend.

What is POST-ONLY mode?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:07
Looks like the actual price now 10:44am Central is ~$17650.  But it's jumping around wildly due to no liquidity between $17-18k because gdax crashed.  
My chart is still frozen at $18,162.

I don't recommend exclusively listening to/reading any one source.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:11:35
Wouldn't be me, friend.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:38
Is it on gdax?
I had the correct amount in my coinbase and gdax accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:19:54
Can confirm, now have BCH in my account.
It's equal to the amount I had in my coinbase account, on coinbase, and equal to the amount I had in my gdax account, on gdax. 
Trading does not appear to be active yet on gdax, but orders are being placed.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:41
Coinbase has got to get their shit together now.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:07
There's no liquidity on GDAX due to the platform crash.  Price is fluctuating between $17k-$18k on single trades.  
Coinbase fucked this one up. 
The price dip is very temporary, imo, as long as coinbase fixes this ASAP.

Sent a transaction of .02 at a 123 SAT/byte fee.  
It's been about 24 hours since I sent it, and still unconfirmed.  
I understand the network is congested, and a higher fee should have been used.  What kind of timeframe am I looking at for confirmation?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:13
Big Fox News fan? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:11
Isn't he one of the many that was sexually assaulting women at Fox?  
Why does he even still have a job?
Oh yeah....it's Fox News...
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:48
Thanks for the help, that appears to be incorrect.

Now departing Earth.
Next destination, the Moon.
Enjoy your flight.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:10:21
It means, keep on waiting.  
The network is congested at the moment and transactions are backlogged.
What fee did you use?  
I'm waiting on a transaction from last Tuesday with a fee of 123 SAT/byte.  
Previously, that was acceptable.  In this climate, that's way too low.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:52
Is there anyway to "guess" at how much longer it will take for a transaction that was sent to me 48 hours ago to confirm?
The fee was 123 SAT/byte

I was a very early adopter of bitcoin.  I am still buying every chance I get.  
   
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:43:48
This is the answer.  
I first got in at $8 and have hodled most coins ever since.  (Yes, I'm happy.  No, I'm not happy that I first learned of bitcoin a full 2 years earlier when it was worth a penny or two, and did nothing with it.  So we all wish we could go back and do it over again.)
I told my brother he should check it out at $260 and consider it.  He said he was too late, it was too expensive, and ultimately decided it was the Beanie Babies of the 2010's and would crash.  
I told my brother at $600.
I told my brother at $2400.
I told him at $4000.
I quit telling him.

You're one angry person.  Your last several posts: 
Really not healthy to be so angry all the time.
