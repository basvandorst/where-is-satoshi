I got in in 2013, but not in enough to be a Baller.

Everyone says this because it looks and *sounds* risky. But it really isn't... I can still recite entire pages of dialog from my favorite movies, and I haven't seen them in years. These are 24 words that I'm reciting *daily.* It may make you uncomfortable, but I will not forget.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:06:42
Thanks for the feedback. I have 5 on the Tails/Electrum solution described above, and around 1.0 stored on Breadwallet on iOS.

I've memorized *two different* 12-word seeds for both Electrum *and* Bread. I repeat them every time I get in bed. And have done so for months. It's memorized, believe me. I mean I still have the word-seeds written down, so a brain injury or whatever doesn't cause me to lose my Bitcoin. It is cool to think that you could drop me naked  any place in the world, and I could move around $40,000 within minutes of accessing a computer.

Will do. I will get a hardware wallet soon. Probably when we break 10k again...  ;)

Well thank you. Around 90% of my net worth is in Bitcoin. The price movements are intense, but you get used to the swings. Never took any off the table on the climb to $20,000, in fact, I bought more. It's hard to lose $50,000 in two months, but it comes with the territory.
I'm not retired, still working, so my Bitcoin wealth is now, and has always felt sort of theoretical. I always said, the price would have to climb high enough that selling would change my life in a meaningful, long-lasting way.
50 grand doesn't do that. So, oh well.

That's very interesting! I hadn't considered a firmware update from the manufactures website, *especially* if I could compile the firmware myself. That solution might actually be ideal.
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:05:46
WiFi is bad, but internet is ok?
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:20:45


Yeah, but if you didn't compile it, you don't know what's on it. Same with Breadwallet, *it's* open source, but it doesn't matter if you're on iOS, because you don't know what code was pushed to the app store.

@_date: 2018-09-03 12:24:50
Thanks. If I wanted to implement one of your 3-3 or 2-3 multisig options, would the fact that I memorized the electrum 12-word seed be pointless then?  
One more question; I also have a Breadwallet on iOS, with around 1.0 bitcoin on it. Would you feel that that is a far-greater sin than my tails set-up?
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:42:57
My electrum 12-word seed is useless if I went to a multisig wallet, right?
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:14:40
And you're super helpful.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:19:54
Oh! Something just occurred to me! There's no reason why you have to use Windows 10 to access your electrum wallets. You could back up the word seeds, and then install Tails (my solution) or another trusted open-source operating system, and then install Electrum there! That's actually what I would do immediately.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:11:37
Dammit! I've already memorized two different sets of 12-word seeds! I'll be up to 48 words that I'll be reciting before bed by the end of the year!
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:08:07
Thanks, I'll look into the Glacier Protocol again. I remember reading an introduction to it last year and thinking... f this.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:09:30
Would you move the balance from the Tails hosted wallet right now then? I mean in your eyes is it that kind of risk?
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:05:19
I don't see any major issue with that, *except* the fact that Windows 10 is closed-source. No one knows what that code is doing. Outside of viruses that you actively download to that system, you're probably fine. But I'm old enough to remember that Windows XP vulnerability that they patched with Service pack 2, where *all you had to do was be connected to the internet* to have you entire system hozed.

Not if you make it a song... or a rap.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:28:23
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:43:33
Thanks! Does this mean the wallet I have now has to go? I've been memorizing the seed for 6 months now. Would love to not have that energy and asset wasted!
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:24:42
Nice! We should get our balances together for a play-date.
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:50:27
Well for the longest time, all my Bitcoin was on a paper wallet just... in my house. As the price climbed last year, I became more and more uncomfortable with the potential liability. Then as soon as I started thinking about how to protect the piece of paper from damage like water or fire, I started to realize just how uncomfortable I was with having a safe in the house, especially since I had to talk about how great Bitcoin is to everyone in town since 2013.  
At that point, I realized I didn't want the "security" of a paper wallet, as it can go up in smoke, literally. And didn't want to use Breadwallet on iOS because of the platform being closed-source (but honestly would be more reluctant to use it on Android!), so I settled on open source software, with a 12-word seed that I can memorize, back up on a cryptosteel buried in the middle of the desert, and then have nothing in the house that can be stolen.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:10:26
Okay, Kalin, first of all, wow, I didn't realize how many posts that I've seen on r/bitcoin were yours! As for your incident on your Breadwallet, I don't know what happened, but the fact that there was a balance left on your wallet... simply doesn't sound like theft. Understand that I'm not saying you are lying, wrong, or any other positive statement like that. What I am saying is that it doesn't look like theft to me. 
Also!  
This is not something that has happened to other people using Breadwallet... like *no one else* has had this happen. Again, not saying that Breadwallet is safe, I'm saying that what happened to you doesn't look like a failure on Breadwallet's part in my opinion.  
Thank you for the heads up anyway! I appreciate you telling me so I could look into it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:02:53
Well thanks. How do you feel about my 1.0 bitcoin stored on my Breadwallet on iOS?
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:26:10
Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:16:09
Holy shit!? Really? I'm looking now.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:17:00
Ahh... okay. And what is your opinion of Breadwallet on iOS/Android? Because it is *super* easy, but doesn't really feel safe to me. But that's the wallet that I recommend to new players, because I think for adoption to occur, it has to be accessible, even if that means compromising a little on security.
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:17:16


*What* setup?
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:45:45
Will consider. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:27:43
Thanks.
