TIL you can donate with Square Cash. Easiest donation ever, took me 2 seconds.

And it works amazingly well with no fees.

For someone so worried about shills, you kinda sound like one yourself.

If that logic was valid a car would equally be an investment, but *it isn't always*. It depends on how you look at things.
Since you're trolling everyone about this your worldview must always be about making money. Not everyone views stuff that way.

I can't, because I've never even commented on r/btc, nor subscribed.

ETH, and LTC. LTC is incredibly undervalued right now.

It did blow up pretty low.

Postal service moved [212.2B]( pieces of mail last year, and it increases every year. I think both coexist quite well.

Not always. If you intend to make money off it sure, but if you intend to strictly use it as a place to live and don't care much about the resulting price, it isn't.

I  understand very well what the thread is about. I was mainly agreeing with you and pointing out the fact that side chain transactions aren't that bad at all.

Yes because they are [insured](

Because it doesn’t need to be anonymous. It is pseudo anonymous and it works as is. If you’d like a full anonymous cryptocurrency, use one. 
If you’re disappointed Bitcoin, the public blockchain that makes everything equal and open, is too open for criminals to use, you’re misunderstanding Bitcoin.

It was more of a comment about BitPay’s super high fee than about the utility of Bitcoin guys. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:56:01
No it doesn’t.

I’m not a newcomer to crypto and you are being a dick to not just newcomers but all in general. The whole point of the post was about BitPay’s high ass fee, but you like many other people in this thread have an axe to grind with everyone and their mother that even *hint* at the fact that Bitcoin isn’t useful.
Guess what: it isn’t. “Digital Cash” only has value if you can spend it.
