The first batch of boards we ordered in Russia, but the quality was not very good and we transferred all orders to China. Also our specialist periodically visits factories that fulfill our orders and checks the quality. quality for us in the first place!

For this we gradually connect all the information channels, including reddit

this information is a trade secret. Even if the buyer opens the corps of the miner, he will not see other people's brands. all spare parts are produced according to the principle of contract production (that is, they manufacture the spare part of the plant according to our project and the terms of reference and under our name)

we do not plan to transfer equipment for surveys and demonstrations, but during this year we will take part in several exhibitions and there anyone who wishes can get acquainted with our miners
