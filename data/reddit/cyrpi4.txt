Is he arrested for selling bitcoin or because of his link to silkroad?
There are still a lot of btc sellers on localbitcoin. Some have been selling for more than a year and these sellers don't appear to be worry.

 If you for example send someone BTC, you know their address and can track the funds. Or in case of for example Mt. Gox addresses, people have tracked funds through their wallets...

Disappointing they're going with Coinbase, but this is the Big Thing I've been waiting on, personally, for a long, long while, now.

Milenials will be using btc before all the dinosaur investors.

Power of what?btc converted into cash to buy a car is completely another thing, usual I would say

 Jason King (feeding the homeless - Sean's Outpost)
 Andreas Antonopoulos (educating the masses)

Is it even legal that FBI keeps bitcoins? and can they affect the price? I'm not quite clear how it's gonna happen
@_date: 2014-04-21 11:28:21
How can it be connected with FBI? I see no relation
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:35:53
Haha! Bitcoin girl in a Bitcoin world. Nice one I like it. BR
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:00:59
They told that it will be treated like any other currency, so It's a good sign!

Take your meds please.

Why the hell would they ever buy blockchain.info if they don't even accept bitcoin, they obviously don't have faith in bitcoin and investors are already pissed they're still not turning a profit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:05:26
No wonder lots of startups are going to use bitcoin in their business, especially if the price is stable and market is safe.

It's my worst nightmare to lose the password to my wallet
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:26:35
Its good thing that people have started understanding how much they can earn via BTC currency.

I vote for HK. because it is closer to where mining machine are made also itself is btc friendsly

I would remove the ability to complain about transaction times.
Bank transfer - &gt; 3-4 days
Paypal - &gt; 4-5 days
Western Union - &gt; 30 minutes to drive and send $14 later also.
Western Union - &gt; 20 minutes to go pick up.
Personal/Business check - &gt; 3 days
Creidt Card Processor - &gt; 1-5 days
Bitcoin - &gt; 0-20 minutes

It's funny how the government won't back you up if you lose money in bitcoins, but they'll readily take a cut if you make money.
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:36:25
Yes, it is a good news tho. ANX Vault (iOS and Andriod) has a new update which able to send and receive Crypto!

satoshi asks gavin to present to CIA in early 2011, then disappears.. wouldnt surprise me if this were true

Traditional banks today must meet strict capital and lending standards. They are also insured by the FDIC so there is basically no risk to deposit holders. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:32:57
I'd promote it but i don't know how, since i'm far away from MIT.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:05:13
It would be hard to force people to report income and pay taxes on peer to peer transactions, but IMO many people will because it is the law and they are afraid of the consequences. You never know that blockchain investigative tools will be available in 10 years that could potentially link people's identity to certain TX.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:05:28
Wow. I love your website! 
I will definitely check this before I travel anywhere.
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:08:11
Here's a better idea. Rather than giving it to charity and personally get nothing from it, just spend it however you'd like and just don't report it for tax. There's no easy way to enforce taxing on this... not with the current technology. The infrastructure and cost to enforce this would be huge.

I begin to think about your girlfriend more than I think about Bitcoin. Hmmm...)

You are telling the thurth ! That's like a disease that can't just be cured so easily !

Smart money is realizing all crypto is backdoored
So crypto the problem
NSA has cooked so much of crypto its got no trust
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:29:25
I think this will never stop. People are willing to goxing that's the problem, we are more willing to believe in good to risk and believe this risk will worth the result (earnings) 
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:43:50
it's not cool to tip when you don't have any money
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:08:18
interesting story with lively photos. enthusiastically looked and read!
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:13:25
Yaeh kinda law of conservation of bitcoin. Maybe in years our grandsons will find it in "Bitcoinomics" books in schools.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:50:06
the headline of the post doesn't match with the plot of the article ,it's not very good article by the way
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:34:53
There is no such insurance fund for bitcoin related banks making anyone who deposits bitcoin at a exchange that operates on a fractional reserve system to be at risk.
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:18:00
Sounds like "Do ya take your pills?".
For lots of people "internet currency" is still something like coins from Mario game. At best. At worst they think you're sick.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:45:16
If no one prove they own the address, I will forward it to my cold storage and wait 10 - 15 years and see what happen to bitcoin. I will probably sell it once it reach 10,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:28:24
We're with you Charlie. The Future is bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:34:12
I understand you are really frustrated by the banks right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:11:16
I would rather wait a bit than buy it now, after such a crush difficult to say who is really trustworthy...

Love the content and idea, don't like the cover.
It's really hard to perceive, why so bright and contrast?
Op, you re great for doing this, as lazy people like me only criticize, but still - please calm the colors next time.
