That may be the ultimate goal, to use it as fluently as cash. But bitcoin as an investment is the number one reason why people buy coins today. Plus, the more people holding BTC, the faster we can get widespread adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:21:10
Its 26% under this study. But I still think that's enough for you to not make assumptions when dealing with them that they are drug addicts.
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:52:02
For a lot of reasons. Primarily because you are trying to save some cash by playing the fluctuations in price. You have a reasonable expectation for the price to go down X amount of dollars, but you don't expect it to go lower than that. The lower you buy, the more money you can make when the price goes up.
Some may use it as a stopping point to protect an investment. Say the coin price is $30 and you bought in at 20. You might put a bids anywhere from 20-29 to sell off your stash in case there is a big downturn or crash. 
A few big stacks may also use this to prop up the price. When someone places a market sell order, it will keep going down the line of bids in order from highest to lowest price. If there is a very large bid (aka a wall), it will take a long time for buyers to eat up these coins, keeping the price at or above the wall. Keep in mind these walls can be retracted and disappear at any time.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:56:54
To me, that sounds like a much bigger hassle than punching in 16 numbers into a website and having the cash instantly withdrawn and trusted.
If and when bitcoin does have widespread adoption, the user-facing transaction should be even quicker than a credit card (not including the confirmations). But right now the main incentive to buy coins it to invest, and it will continue this way until we get more coins into the hands of more people, which will encourage more businesses to accept them.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:38:52
Keep your coins wherever you feel comfortable based on your technical ability.
If you have a small amount of value in BTC, then keeping it on Coinbase is probably not a big deal and is the most convenient. But keep in mind, there have been a handful of cases over the years of these wallet sites and exchanges being hacked, so you run that risk.
Keeping it on your own computer is another option, but I would avoid this unless you know what you are doing. There are viruses created which have the ability to scan for and steal wallets. If you like this option, a good idea is to store the coins on a computer that doesn't touch the internet. You will want to store a backup somewhere else too, like a paper wallet, just in case the computer fails.
If you have a lot of coins, it may be worth creating a [paper wallet]( anyway. This allows you to store your coins on a printed piece of paper, which you can deposit in a safety deposit box or a safe or somewhere else. This is can also be called "cold storage".
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:32:53
But the point is that they have no idea when something goes wrong. Once you receive the order form to bring to the MoneyGram location, it's out of their hands and its all up to you. It's your responsibility to make sure the wire transfer is accurately completed.

Took the survey. It was decent. I really don't think the "when did you first install the bitcoin client" is a question worth asking or reporting data from. Many people don't install the client. I've been using bitcoin for over a year, and I didn't install a client until a couple months ago (when I got serious and started investing). Before that, I just kept everything in Gox because it wasn't a very large amount to lose.
Plus, a lot of people these days use online wallets, like blockchain. I think better questions would be "When did you first hear about bitcoin?" or "When did you purchase your first bitcoins?"

Certainly. If I've got money to burn in my account, I will put in larger bid positions at a point right before some of the buy walls in congruence with the volume of the biggest recent dumps.

The cheapest way is Dwolla to Gox, but this can take ages, especially if you are a new user to either or both of the websites.
If you aren't against leaving the house (but don't just want to buy them from some guy on localbitcoins) you can use  to do a wire transfer. The fees are pretty nasty though. 4% plus the cost of the wire transfer.
Coinbase.com I've heard is great, and it would be the fastest and most convienient way to transfer money directly from a bank account into bitcoins. However since it gained popularity, they seem to almost always be at capacity for the 24 hour period, meaning you need to be patient or quick to buy from them.
@_date: 2013-02-15 16:54:27
I think since the most successful businesses in bitcoin so far are most definitely illegal ones (in the US anyway), maybe we should start moving into the pseudo-legal ones.
The biggest category that comes to mind is Usenet subscriptions and their respective indexing sites. Astraweb, Bintube, Supernews, Giganews, whatever. No one wants to give credit card or paypal information to these sites due to the nature they are used for.
Also in this category would be online gun &amp; gun accessory sales. I don't know of the biggest players in this market are, but would appreciate suggestions.
Another category would be things that are embarrassing to have show up on the credit card statement. Brazzers and DigitalPlayground would be two of the biggest, but maybe targetting some of the sites that feature sex acts outside the norm would be under more pressure to provide anonymous purchases. Kink.com and EvilAngel are the two biggest on this list: 
Or even more personal, live cam sites. I think there is already a cam site that takes bitcoins, but its small and I can't remember the URL. But what about IMlive or LiveJasmin, which seem to be the biggest according to a quick search.

When you go to the supermarket or drug store, you almost always walk right past a whole shelf full of gift cards. All of these gift cards can be bought at cost.

They'll point you to a telephone and give you some paperwork to fill out for a wire transfer. Then you complete the transaction with the person from the wire transfer company on the other side of the telephone. At least this is how it worked at CVS.
The transaction fees are not as cheap as Coinbase or Dwolla. It's 3.99% for BitInstant, whatever the fee for the wiretransfer is, and then the Mt Gox fee (0.6%). $100 in Bitcoin will cost about 10 bucks.
Sometimes its cheaper to find someone local who can sell you them in person. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 13:41:48
Do you think its reasonable to assume we can get 99%+ of transactions off the block chain? It's possible but that doesn't sound very easy without more centralization or really strong cooperation of Coinbase/Paypal like websites and widespread adoption/acceptance of exchange codes.

You should also know the lingo - "market buy" orders and "market sell" orders.
Say there are two sellers. One is selling 5 coins @ $120, the other is selling 5 coins @ $130. If a buyer were to execute a market buy order for 7 coins, they would first wipe out the first 5 coins $120, and then immediately and automatically buy 2 coins @ $130 from the 2nd seller. 
Works the opposite way for a market sell.

Saving the auto industry doesn't translate to saving Detroit because most people don't live in the city, they live in the suburbs.
Detroit has to declare bankruptcy because it was built for 2 million people, and now it has less than 750,000 (with the metro area containing 4.2 million). They couldn't keep up with public services being stretched so far after decades of ups and downs.

I spend mine too to help with the economy, but that's just because I'm passionate about it. I don't see people spending it unless they have some to spend, in which case, telling them for what reason they should buy bitcoins is discouraging. 
I don't refute it becoming less stable when people hoard, but there's no reason to use BTC right now for everyday purchases because its a huge hassle versus a credit card. There are lots of reasons to use bitcoin, but none of them are really applicable at the moment since there is no widespread adoption. There needs to be a reason for people to obtain BTC first, be it investment, drugs, a passion for technology, or whatever. But telling people to spend it is not an incentive to spend it.

As an American leftist bitcoin supporter, I completely agree. You can't just group the entire left into the socialist boat and not seem extreme, especially to the rest of the world. In fact there are very very few American lefties who believe we should be socialist.
Then again, OP could be taking a very broad definition of socialism, which is another popular thing for conservatives to do in the US. Even just one economic or political policy supporting the idea that certain things should not be for profit can be labeled socialist under these terms. Never mind that according to that, we are already a socialist country.

This is likely your fault, the cashier's fault, or ZipZap's fault. Its really easy to fuck up the process. I've never had problems with bitinstant. Although I really don't know why everyone does cash to BTC and not cash to Gox. Its still being bought through Gox either way and its a lot safer.

It's happening even before high school. I went home for Thanksgiving, and my two cousins who are in 7th grade could not stop talking about it once they heard I was very much into the concept.
I told them both if they managed to setup a wallet without my help, I would give them $5 worth of BTC. Both of them figured it out within a half hour, and now are probably the coolest kids in school.
