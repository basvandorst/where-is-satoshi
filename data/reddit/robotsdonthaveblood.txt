Well how did he acquire those funds? Surely someone transferred him them, likely he used an exchange that he still holds an account on, with proof of the purchase of BTC and transfer thereof to his wallet. He would have the transaction from his bank to the exchange as well, assuming he used a bank transfer like many do. Someone who opted not to have a backup of their wallet likely isn't mining, but if they were they likely weren't using p2p mining so they would have a mining account with a pool they could refer to as well. I could say I had 50k in cash in the house too, they're not going to replace that blindly either. There is a paper trail here that could save his value, even if it's just the original purchase amount. OP makes it sound like the man who's house burned down did this investment fairly recently too.

We shall see, Walmart has justified moving piles of manufacturing jobs into the US, so clearly the US labour force is now cheaper than that of 'developing nations.'

Really? Sure seems to me like homeowners insurance would cover the loss of a financial asset like that. 
Edit: can anyone give me a valid reason why it wouldn't be covered? It's declared property by the IRS, just like the computer itself, or the furnishings within the house. Also the house itself. Don't just downvote, give me a reason I'm wrong.

Oh granted, I'm not at all condoning the act of blowing your whole wad on speculation, just that I don't think the financial system we're all used to in North America is going to last long enough to assure that 7% yearly for all that long. It's not a viable 'retirement savings' option for me to invest in failing nations.

This is why we have safety deposit boxes for pertinent documents and financial instruments. I have several (encrypted) usb drives and hard drives stored in one for various reasons, crypto being one of them. Though I also have mirrors stored outside of that box too, some are even buried in small pelican cases. It sucks that he had the foresight to invest so early, but didn't take the precautions to protect his investment.

Choosing to do what you suggested, but in the mild pacific. Not using a single fucking utility other than what I provide for myself, or pay for directly like internet. Funded heavily by investments in crypto. Seeing as myself and my sweet boat can easily travel between my sweet private island and any port city on the west fuckin' coast I don't see how it's going to be difficult.. I'm eyeballing one with 160 acres of crown land bordering 80 of my own acres, all heavily forested. Developer thinks the gov is unlikely to sell off more than the 80 acre parcel so essentially it's 240 acres of private island for under a million.
This shit can be done for less than 500k with smaller islands suitable for one, or a dozen people, easily, and for some holders on this sub, that is simply not a lot of money anymore. Combine this with the tiny house movement and you have a recipe for island micronations forming all over the north west coast. They won't need you, your government, or anything anymore.

When your purchasing power goes down by 10% and you're getting 7% return you're losing 3%. Sure, you may have more money, but it means nothing because a loaf of bread is now $1.10 instead of $1.00. Beating inflation in the coming years is going to be very, very difficult.

I would never trust a state sponsored application of any kind. What better way to control what your citizens browse online than to have your state sponsored web browser say the sites you want to go to are stealing yer datas, and then have the state sponsored antivirus chime in to ramp up the fear. Do you trust your government that much, that you're wiling to give them access to your computer? People around the world are up in arms about NSA backdoors, and Five Eyes, but you are -willingly- giving your government access to your personal life. Wow, man. Just.. wow.

Yeah, see that thing that happened when Cyprus banks started pulling some asset freezing crap? BTC rose. I suspect it will rise greatly against the USD or CAD should the USD start to falter. Perhaps the value of BTC will stay, but the competing fiat will devalue so much that it will appear to rise in value. Or maybe you're right, and commodities will flourish. Which I have. A lot more of than I have crypto. Diversification is important. 
The development of a blockchain radio-link is a good start to removing the requirement of internet for all blockchain operations. I will likely have reliable access to the internet though as satellites up in space don't give much of a shit about strife on earth. My present downlink is in Manitoba, in the middle of nowhere. It's unlikely to be looted, and so long as power is flowing up here in Canada I'm sure I'll have internet, at least to the portions of the world with active links. Not all websites or services are dependant on American infrastructure. Americans have this odd hubris about controlling the entire internet. It would get on just fine if every link to the US was severed. Slower, mind you, but it would work just fine. Oh no, Facebook is gone. Reddit is gone, the travesty. TPB will still be up, so I can still pirate media to trade with. 
As per my neighbours? Where? Get them the fuck off -my- island. Repel all boarders! Seriously though I hope to be utterly self sustaining until I die, and will not need the help or materials of others. I'm using BTC as a store of value. Just like metals. I'm not going to attempt to trade with people using silver that is just as useless to them as BTC would be. I'll have the supplies, food, and skills to trade with should I need equipment or supplies I have exhausted or cannot create myself. Once life returns to normalcy again, be it in months, or years, or however long, I'll have stored wealth to buy into whatever new currency is the global standard. 
For the record, regardless of economic collapse, my plans are the same. The world needs bees, I hope to be a viable source for clean bees to anyone around the world who needs them. I want to grow all my own food, raise and catch my own meat and spend as little money as possible for the greatest amount of pleasure throughout life. You're looking at a financial collapse as 'no one has anything, power is out, internet is gone, your android phone is suddenly on fire and useless' when that won't be the case. Many, many, many people will die with power and internet flowing because they're at a loss of what to do about food if there isn't any to be had at Walmart. 
My hoard wallets are all offline, with paper copies stored in various places. So long as the blockchain survives, so will my value.

Not living in the US helps a lot, but being a citizen of their northern brother isn't much better. BTC isn't tied to the North American economy, nor any countries economy. It's a truly stateless and regulationless currency. If the US dollar tanks, I would rather have Bitcoins protecting my value for the future. The world won't be swept into a Mad Max style technological dark age when the US fails, but the US dollar and likely the Canadian dollar will go way down in purchasing power. Yesterday bread was 1 dollar Canadian, which is 0.0015 BTC (google as source.) If you wake up tomorrow and your Canadian dollar is worth 10% of what it once was, that loaf of bread is now 10 dollars, but still 0.0015 BTC.. actually it might even be LESS BTC because such a financial catastrophe would send the nay sayers into crypto right quick to try and save some of their value, thus driving the price of coins up even further. 
I already have several days worth of food and water stocked (enough to get out to somewhere more sustainable) and it's harder to get guns up here, so I rely on my family to stock pile the ammunition for me. I'm also moving my life away from 'modern' society, to my own private island (it's so god damn cheap up here I wish I did this years ago) to watch the world burn from. With bees, aeroponics, renewable energy and all the outdoor nudery I can handle. I can't wait to sell pesticide free queen bees for BTC, while wearing nothing at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all.

That's all well and good now, but do you sincerely think the US economy can keep this 'quantitative easing' shit going on? I don't think we are going to see assured returns by the time someone now in their mid 20s is able to retire. I would never wager my whole retirement on one investment though. Diversification and understanding of the global economy goes a long way to protecting yourself.

Yeah, it's like no one thinks things out. The idea is great, but this current execution is wrong. A URL and a QR code, mentioning "Send money faster than WU" and "Nearly anonymous" would go a long way to generating interest too.

I think it largely depends on your local demographic. Locally, we have gobs of immigrants from China and the Philippines, many of which like moving money around without the local government knowing. They've (primarily the Chinese) literally taken over enough of the local property that they're sincerely considered 'the masses' at this point as well compared to actual born citizens. Maybe a small town in Nebraska wouldn't have the same reaction to such a feature, but I can say it would help gain traction up here.

I suggested the same in a few days ago. Our currency sucks ass, it drops a penny every day or so against USD. If we let our federal budget ride the BTC train we might be able to keep some value for dem programs. 
Economists and talking airheads spend a lot of time speculating about the bottom for our dollar, but never bother to inquire about ways to keep it from spiraling lower and lower. Some of them claim it'll drop below 50c. That'll make a hotdog at Ikea go from 75c (it used to be 50c a few months ago) to about a buck fitty. I fuckin' hate the state of this country.

I actually hadn't considered state subsidies, that's a good point. It's still worth noting that the cost of coal shouldn't just be measured in financial costs. There are the long lasting costs to the environment that should be considered as well. Same goes for where solar panels and batteries are manufactured and sourced as well. That too has a measurable environmental impact that needs to be considered, including transport to the end user.

They're a lot more robust than you think, they're built to withstand hail and wind after all. I can't tell you how many times I've been lazy about setting up the stand for a couple of my 100w ones only to have a gust of wind come along and blow the things face down onto the gravel driveway. I always assume the worst, but never a scratch let alone a crack. The PV cells themselves are very delicate, having built my own panels from b grade cells on the cheap for kicks I know how easily those break and the aquarium glass I've mounted them against isn't anywhere as durable as the commercial glass. The protective glass and frames in my commercial ones though really stand up to some shit. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:43:21
You mean in coal, right? That's where the most subsidies are in the US presently, other nations that have achieved parity or better have done it for different reasons. India, for example, has hefty coal import costs from Australia, and that is what drove solar to be more economical there.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:34:01
Solar is already cheaper than coal, today, right now, on this planet. That happened mid 2014 or so, and solar and wind generation costs continue to drop into this year.

Do not for one moment underestimate the power of the market. I cannot tell you how my clientele has changed over the years in regards to selling bitcoins. It's gone from nerdy individuals in mid 2011 to sketchy small time dealers that spend too much time online in 2012 to straight up to M3 driving motherfuckers who deal with bound, machine counted stacks. They know full well the power of bitcoin now, and just because one means of exchanging it for drugs has gone offline doesn't mean they aren't working on their own solutions. The next person to jump to market with a secure, viable option will make ludicrous amounts of money.

What good is encrypted email when you are getting contraband sent right to your door? Safe drops are either addresses that you know you can pick crap up from during hours the regular tenants aren't around, or that PO box service at the local mom n pop convenience store that only wants cash and no names, perhaps a recently abandoned storefront or something. It's easy to find these sort of things, and the internet is full of textfiles from the 80s forwards about protecting yourself when dealing with illegal goods, stolen cc's and any number of things.

Buying and holding Bitcoins does nothing for the economy behind Bitcoin. Companies that list publicly for fiat also go under, and take your money, or the stock devalues and you lose out.
