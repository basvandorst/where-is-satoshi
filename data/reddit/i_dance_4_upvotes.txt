It all comes down to whether you're trying to win a long or short term game. Whether or not you're a believer in what Bitcoin can become.
I am a believer and this is the one time in my life I don't plan on pulling out early.

I have a Trezor. I was planning on not using this wallet and keeping it blank. Do you have any advice in that regard?

How do I do this?

I'm a little confused as to why people are saying if you aren't running a full node you are not really in control of your bitcoin. When I own a Trezor and it's obviously not a full node.

Done! In the same way can I do this and support the UASF?

I think you replied to the wrong comment. I wasn't asking how to open a port. My question which has since been answered was what opening the port did to the application. I've already allowed it through. I do appreciate the helpful tip either way.
