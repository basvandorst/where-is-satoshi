Because users such as yourself seem to believe that claims such as that mean I run a honeypot.
Most big time hackers, end up working for the FBI.
I respect your concerns sir, but whether or not my intentions of working for the FBI as a joke, will not change your online security.

If we don't have it, then it's private. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:44:31
Great question! The best part is you don't have to, we never ask for any information!
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:50:10
I understand your concerns sir, but it would be physically impossible to store all of that data.
Also, there is no way for any VPN company to prove that it doesn't store logs. Our VPN is simply the best option as even if there were logs they don't link back to anyone.
Anyone could have hijacked your network and been connecting to the VPN for all we know.

Perhaps the US is doing more, this is the most recent information I know of.

Honey Pot doesn't benefit us in any way, we run a COMPANY, not a charity.

Website is definitely online.
Perhaps your ISP is restricting your internet access, just another reason to get our VPN.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:40:47
I don't want to debate what the US can do, because that could go on for hours. All I can vouch for is the quality of this VPN service.
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:27:11
That's the whole thing. You don't need to trust us our site speaks for itself. 
I understand your concerns, we respect them as much as you do that is why we created this service.
Go on our website and you will see that our platform is completely unique. We never ask for any of your personal information so how could we store it?
You will see that this is indeed a next level VPN service.

They do not, these operations were exposed and google is implementing new data encryption techniques even between servers locally to prevent the data spying.
The old data spying worked by intercepting local data relays that were unencrypted. 
These relays are now encrypted.

That was one of the most illogical statements I have ever heard in my life. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:16:32
We never ask for information. The statement is true. Whether or not information is exposed as part of the internet protocol is something which can not be controlled or changed by use.
The internet is inherently flawed, and we try our best to find solutions for these flaws. Such as keeping your personal information completely private.

Gmail is one of the most secured SMTP providers. You will be hard pressed to get access into a gmail without a lot of work by authorities.

I appreciate your feedback sir, although this service is very reliable and most importantly affordable. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:39:39
Yes it is very fast sir, there is absolutely zero rate limiting.
