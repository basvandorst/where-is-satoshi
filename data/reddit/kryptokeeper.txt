People like you are why Dogecoin is taking off. These coins are all the same, fundamentally. The only difference is the community.

Darkcoin is trying to solve this issue.
In the beginning, Bitcoin was completely anonymous. This was because your coins weren't BOUGHT from anyone, you mined them, and you had them. Nobody knew you had them, but you... and maybe the few people that had screen shot malware sending screenies every so often... but this technology didn't take into account that people would start pegging it against the dollar. In actuality, the original founders and crowd like myself, hoped this would supplant the fiat system we have currently, in it's entirety, at least I hoped so.
But, unfortunately, that isn't the reality that happened. Instead, we all got into a system that requires you to identify yourself with valid state-issued IDs and everything else. I used to mine back in the beginning, but like an idiot, I didn't think to keep probably 100 coins I mined early on because they were just "play money" and I couldn't even buy the world-famous pizza for bitcoin back then because that hadn't even happened! Anyway, I digress. DarkCoin seems to have this figured out though, and they are implementing a new coin with several actual technological enhancements to the core Bitcoin protocol. Check it out if you feel privacy is really important.
Please note, I'm not affiliated with the coin in any way officially. I just like the idea, and stand behind what they are trying to do.

Have this downloaded and installed. Pretty neat from what I saw of it briefly. Haven't played with it much, yet.
