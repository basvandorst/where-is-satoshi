I stand corrected.  I think I was getting confused by the [browser choice update for European installs]( which obviously has nothing to do with the US v MS case.  The link above was the result of a European antitrust case, and it looks like that just linked to installs rather than bundling the other browsers.

+1 INTERNET  
Tip someone with the string "+1 internet". If this keyword is detected in your comment, the recipient will get a bitcent (0.01 BTC). If "+1 internets" is detected, the recipient will get 2 bitcents (0.02 BTC). If you have this feature enabled, be careful when you say "+1 internet" because you should mean it and a bitcent will be deducted from your balance.

To an extent, I agree with your "their fucking software/hardware stack" point.  
That said, the upcoming contest of mobile payment processors is a bigger issue than just bitcoin.  By [preventing other forms of payment processing ]( in their app store, they gain a significant advantage for their own mobile payment processing system.  
Microsoft owns the Windows stack, but there's precedent for forcing them to allow competing browsers - hell, they started including other browsers in their Windows install after the [United States vs Microsoft]( Antitrust case.
It'll be interesting to see how the courts handle competing payment processors and apps on mobile devices in the years to come.

The rate at which people are finding out about bitcoin is faster than the rate at which bitcoins are being produced.  Couple that with the decrease from 50/block to 25/block that comes next year, and I think there's going to be a continued demand.

Both of those passwords (correcthorsebatterystaple and ;is%j&amp;84&amp;jJgkd&amp;483jsJdnd) are going to take an extremely long time to brute force.  One of them is memorable, the other requires a password manager, or writing down the password, or re-using it because you can only remember so many random strings of characters.
A good long passphrase has significant enough entropy to make brute forcing it harder than most password requirements will do on their own - such as the ones duffmanhb was talking about.  (must be 8 characters, must include a capital letter, a number, etc).  That's really the only point I was trying to make - that forcing rules like that does not ensure secure or high quality passwords.
Hell, if you want more entropy, add some spaces and punctuation to your passphrase:
    "For example, this'll show up as a much better password than the above two examples".

  844 blocks until the estimated difficulty jump to 1564262 from 1379223.  
844 blocks at 6.83/hr is about 5 days (5.149).
If that doesn't climb over 10 blocks per hour, why would difficulty go up?  Wouldn't it go down to keep the rate at 10/hr?
Am I reading something wrong, do I have some fundamental misconception about how difficulty works, or am I just not accounting for the growth in the network hashrate between now and mid-next week?
