Difficulty is not directly related to the price but to the combined hashing power which is somehow related to the price. So in the long term if price will be much lower then it **can** affect difficulty.

This reminds me of e-stamps. That was a popular idea loooong time ago. For [example]( The main drawback was "There's no digital money infrastructure for small transactions". Not a problem any more. :)

Great idea! Maybe I'll do it. At least I'll think about it. ;)

Why not? Do you think bitcoin won't go up anymore? I don't think so.

I think it is a good start. ;)
Just a few suggestions. Add:
- option to change transaction fee
- another scenario when you sell BTC and buy them back later
- save transactions/trades

Maybe on btc-e but not on MtGox. I wanted to know that too, so I tried with small order and it was executed at the highest bid price.

How do you know they are better and most of all safer? Not long ago people also suggested bitcoin-24. Was it a smart move to bitcoin-24???
I don't say that MtGox is better than the others.
