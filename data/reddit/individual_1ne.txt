At least in theory, it encourages distribution of hands. Imagine if we always had a finite amount when the system began; the initial savers would just pass down their wealth and distribution of funds would be fairly limited. Given that our population has been on the rise since the beginning of this system, an increase of funds that can be more distributed, whether through debt/loan or fed directly through investment that feeds wages and livelihood, is good for the population overall. In theory.

Fidelity has already been mining btc and eth for a few years... Technically they don't need to hold "a lot", just enough to cover insurances that they probably offer.  I imagine, based on [this article]( that they are buying on the spot with a markup for their services, or a fee involved.

Depends on how the infrastructure plays out... If Visa/American Express/Mastercard are any indication, most services will be limited to only a few options for transactions... in which case you'd most likely need to convert alt coins for a lot of true-life interactions.

just my opinion because I've never made a transaction like op, but an ATM card or even cash looks much less complex and more simple than this system.  It's exciting to see it used, but there has to be an easier way.

In theory, it allows the short riders to get out a bit, and the holders to continue to prop price temporarily... without consolidation/corrections on your ride up, you will stock pile a LOT of traders (often using leverage) that once it really starts to dump, will all cashout causing a crash and return of bearish mentality.
