Correct. It's called market activity. Besides, you spelled it wong. It's a "carsh" not a crash.

Listening to snake oil folks. Some folks need to be stupid for others to get their hunters and gatherings.

Cat signals
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:25:00
By moon you mean 5700 based upon 2013 standards, 
and by Buckle Up you mean straight jacket for your insanity,
and by EFT's being approved you mean ALF as in Alien Life Force,
and by holding you mean HODL cause it's your first day on the job,
and by opportunity you mean luggage,
and by low again, you mean the new standard,
then OK thanks for saving us the trouble with your POS PSA
