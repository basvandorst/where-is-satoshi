This sucks.  I'm with Lloyds too.
My plan, when (if?) the time comes, is to sell crypto via Localbitcoins and deposit it into my business account each week.  The small business I run does about 50% card, 50% cash, so an extra few grand each month would be simple to hide.
Yes, I'll get screwed on the sale of crypto, but I'll never have to answer to anybody where the money came from.  As far as they're concerned, I just have a successful small business.  No questions from Mr Taxman etc.  Perfect for slowly building up a savings account that can easily be used to put into real estate later - perhaps with a large mortgage that I can pay off very quickly with more crypto proceeds, thus using the real estate to further hide from the government and banks the original source of the money.
Assuming, of course, that crypto is still seen as threatening to banks.  If they get their act together and embrace crypto, then my plan is unnecessary.

I want to millionaire too.
(Love the use of this word as a verb.  Like 'medal' started being used as a verb in the Olympics a while ago.)

You don't get jailed for debt in the US.  That's gone long ago.
If I committed by keys to memory and deleted all the electronic records, that's also beyond the reach of the law.  The Constitution gives me absolute privacy to my mind.
So worst case, I'd be an asshole, but a free asshole.

Has anybody checked to see if there's a corresponding increase in the use of any altcoins?
Maybe like Ethereum?
Just a thought.  Perhaps it's time to take off the tinfoil hats?
