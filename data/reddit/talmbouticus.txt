This happened to me, I had called in to their customer support line.  They had me detach the bank account and then reattach it, it worked fine after that.

This post is exactly what you shouldn’t do.  You shouldn’t buy a house and look back and feel this way.  Sure you could have waited, but at the time, you wanted your own real estate which is your place in this world.  It’s also one of the best investments and comes with its own homeownership benefits.  
I am already preparing to go down the same road and I’m sure in 2023 we will both be looking back, but no regrets on a home.  Pizza, yes, and computer games, yes, but not a house.

Nobody knows where the stock market is going to go either.  The stock market has crashed before.  But putting 1% or 2% into it isn’t crazy.  Risk vs reward.  You’ve gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

That’s not “merely” you goof, just because they are not manufacturing their own “Samsung Miner” doesn’t mean that this isn’t a big deal!  If you think manufacturing a product is the only way to make $$$, you’ve got a lot to learn about business.  
A new distribution pathway from a major corporation 
- will create more competition in the ASIC mining space (Bitmain doesn’t have to be the only show)
- can reduce costs (whether or not the market passes that savings all the way down to the consumer level is to be seen)
- the eventual increase to Samsung stock will be correlated to an increase in bitcoin value, as one of the largest manufacturers have a vested interest in our crypto ecosystem — (Fans of Samsung who weren’t fans of bitcoin now become aware of bitcoin, they see the relationship and invest into bitcoin, because it seems like a less volatile market if Samsung is involved)
Now the thing is — this requires patience to watch unfold — the effect on Samsung stock won’t be as drastic until the quarterly earnings report after production of the chip starts
What does this mean? Buy the Samsung dip, as they are down right now.

So after the stock market crash, they said “we are gathered here today to say that only rich white males can invest in startup businesses”
Good thing for civil rights movements, or else they would make it to where only rich (money handed down) white males would be able to buy bitcoin if they could.

I feel bad for the average joe, who could put $5-10 of their paycheck into crypto every week and "see what happens" -- this pretty much eliminates that.  But I haven't tried an ACH transfer, I don't know if that charges the same?

I understand what you mean, however based on graphs of standard deviations, the government punishes people within the range of the top 10-30%.
If you are in the top 10%, you can invest in these businesses and startups.  
If you are in the top 10-30%, sorry, you don’t carry enough annual income, and we must punish/protect you and the “average” person for the mistakes of the outliers, 30% and below.
Right now is like a “Wild West” for Crypto, in that we are re-living history.  My point (in today’s terms) is only - why would I want to be punished because some Noob got scammed by at YouTuber or Facebook Ad?  
I understand you mean the government is seeking to protect from scams, but I think people should be allowed to do their own research and invest in things however they like.
That is also what is great about decentralized cryptocurrencies.  And the fact that they are backed by one of the coolest technologies — blockchain.  
People once shared music on mIRC, that grew to Napster, we made Kazaa, Morpheus, Bearshare... graduated to Torrents, created streaming torrents... now we are at blockchain.  This movement doesn’t stop today :)
