As someone that took it then, its really not. And saying "12th grade honors math" is really disingenuous. 


Ah, didn't see that, since the $100 contribution only comes with software, not hardware. I'm also wondering where you'll get an NFC enabled tablet (drop in solution) for &lt; $150 and still make a profit.

I...use mongodb :(
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:37:16
No, but the miners do. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:16:33
Holy shit how much did the Lotus cost you?
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:17:57
They're selling an Android app that a decent developer can write in a few weeks for $150?
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:28:47
No, he's just comparing utilities. I don't think he wanted to describe a fully thought out analogy. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:03:58


Polis [supports single-payer]( for the record.

Oh jesus.

Its all fun and games until someone starts to play Fruit Ninja on what should be your face. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:56:10
Wait, he still lives at his old place?
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:23:39
And of course, only for MIT students. 
I wish I wasn't a fucking moron. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:53:27
I'm all for bitcoin. But not as a primary currency. That's just ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:40:35


Can't wait to see this on @_date: 2014-08-14 15:44:06
Well, she did get into Duke...
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:12:46
Jared Polis is truly great. Great progressive voice in the House. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:52:49
Oh jesus. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:12:06
He's asking why doing this would be anti-feministic when it is her choice and her choice alone. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:45:25
What's the hardware? Off the shelf?
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:29:53
Yeah, I'm not special, and I'll never be. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 01:58:41
Which ones...?
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:52:13
As in, did you develop the hardware or are you just buying Hisense Heros and loading the app?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:26:17
Exactly. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:05:00


I don't necessarily disagree. He doesn't discount its worth, he just thinks that investing in it as a commodity isn't terribly valuable. That's pretty sensible. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:38:29
Fuck them and their happiness ;(
@_date: 2015-05-20 07:16:22
I'm thinking it'll emit a sound wave that makes us all go crazy. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:53:29
No need to be defensive dude. I just don't understand why an ATM APK without any support or hardware should sell for $150. 
Although to be honest, honors classes aren't exactly impressive (especially in senior year? 12th grade honors math is Pre-Calc).
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:16:55
I'd love to hate him, really, but he gave me 5 paycoin back when it was $10.
Helooo food mill. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:31:37
Fucking rich kids. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:48:35
He could have given someone access to his keys for all we know. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:44:23
I blame this on the Freedom Caucus
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:57:58
Brainwashing who?
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:31:40
I really feel bad - not just for us, but for people in Ukraine and the baltics who are going to be the first victims of further Russian aggression. 
With that said, if he tries to tax remittances higher then there's a market for another BTC remittance app for the Mexican and South American market. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:44:11
Makes sense - they probably can't launder money through Manhattan real estate anymore. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:17:00


Poor wording, people in the baltics are going to be the first to experience a new wave of expansion if it happens. Ukrainians are already suffering for it. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:34:46
...on foreign policy, which is true. 
On economic policy they mostly fell in line. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:09:10
That was actually legitimately great. 
@_date: 2012-12-03 01:08:08
I stopped bitcoining when I realized that anyone that exchanges my bitcoins for cash will probably just be purchasing illicit substances or paraphernalia. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:53:24
Is that a good Oh Boy or a bad Oh Boy?
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:34:12


This sounds like a solution looking for a problem. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:50:03
Ok. Careless even. Still better than the man that denies climate change, thinks vaccines cause autism, wants to build a useless wall along the southern border, doubts our President's citizenship and put religious tests at border checkpoints. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 04:00:35


You're aware that the first world country I live in had criminalized sodomy in some states until 2003 right?


Oh yeah that was Catholics instead. Forgot about that too. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:22:05
Point 1) 
Point 2) 
Point 3) 
Point 4) 
What in the actual fuck man? That's some fucked up racist bullshit. 
NYT piece a year before the bad bio - 
Point 5) You're a bigot and unamerican. Pure and simple. 
I have quite a few Jewish, Hindu, Women, and Gay friends and a daughter. I know how Christianity and radical Atheism views all of those groups and I'd like to keep my daughter as far away from that as possible.
@_date: 2016-10-19 05:29:03
Are you claiming he's not actually a rapist? lmao
@_date: 2016-10-19 06:48:51
Nice conspiracy theories boi 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:27:13
One lizard sexually assaults women and brags about it while deligitimizing our first black president and kissing up to Putin. 
The other makes speeches at banks and is bad at IT. This is a shockingly easy decision for Hillary. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:23:40


Not in the fucking UK you dolt. 


Yes. For terrorists. 
You're seriously going to claim that they wanted to bomb the Ecuadorean embassy because they killed Anwar al-Awlaki? You're insane. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:28:37


This can pretty much be said for the entire email leaks. 


But dude, you don't understand the [how much of a game changer this is]( 
IMO, it's pretty cool that the campaign directly referenced Smart Contracts and Cryptocurrency in their technology proposals. That's more than Donald could say. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:24:05
It was, at worst, a joke. Like, wow people are easily offended these days. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:23:41
Well, he's already admitting to be a moron, so probably. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:25:01
How is that clueless? 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:29:44


Cuz she's our next president, bitch! 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:26:11
There are, AFAIK, multiple democrats that take BTC donations. Jared Polis does for certain. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 05:29:24
I'm beginning to think you don't understand...jokes. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:43:18
Its very similar to how The first three Bond films did. Goldfinger, for instance, didn't cover the spectre organization at all, but it was picked up again in Thunderball (and will definitely be picked up again in Spectre). 
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:33:49
Time traveling? What?
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:26:08
Stallman has donated for the Green Party. 
 
And why shouldn't large amounts of Bitcoins be taxed? Bitcoins aren't a means to avoid the tax system. This isn't (or shouldn't be) a going Galt fantasy. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 03:25:30
What Android API are you using for maps?
Great idea, by the way. I should have thought of that!
@_date: 2013-03-18 21:18:29
Is the offer still valid? :)

But now the dirty Chinese statists will want to shoot you even more!

Huh, I live near him. Interesting. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:23:46
I don't understand why he would care. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:40:36
I'm working on a simple bitcoin ticker and alert system with Pebble integration for a client right now (it sends you a Pebble notification when the price goes up or down by a set percentage). 
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get back any more feedback yet, so the project is in limbo. If anybody else wants to test the app, PM me. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 02:43:08
I'm not a fan of luxury cars either. The only thing I can possibly justify paying more than $25K for (already really steep) is an electric or a plug in electric vehicle.

Dear god man, how much money do you HAVE?

It HAS occurred to you that in many cases people borrow because they have no other option, right?

Oh god, my code review sense is tingling. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 22:19:37
Nice try, But seriously, this is really cool. Nice job to the dev! 
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:16:13
1) what do you do
2) How can I do what you do
@_date: 2013-05-17 04:11:31
Yes, that's true. But that doesn't change his actual political allegiances, and I'm sure that many of the company's fiscal decisions have been subordinated. 
I still find tax avoidance disgusting, but that's beside the point. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 02:53:43
One one hand, we've got another power user on our side. On the other hand, the person's a libertarian. 
Eh. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:46:58
Or not, because Larry Page is actually really liberal. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:58:15


I regret making my own bitcoin alarm app. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:59:47
If it's open source, then sure. I'm trying to at least contribute to at least a couple of open source projects.
