Awesome stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:09:47
Story time :
I started with 0.2 BTC.
Then at phase 2, I decided to redistribute half of my BTC onto alts.
Majorly in the less risky once.
And after last week's shit-show, I go got it all back on to BTC now.
It's been more than 3 months. 
An now am at &gt;0.3 BTC worth.
Had I not done it, I would be 0.2BTC.
So, just an opinion, if you have time to research and adjust your portfolio on  timely basis, do it.
Edit : as of now, waiting to diversify again! Right times.
Been playing this at lower risks and no shills, turned out well.

Story time :
In my country, we have an app where for every purchase you referral make, you get some satoahis.
So I forwarded invite to all my workmate.
He denies of all the trades he make. But I keep on getting free stuff almost weekly once. 
Can't wait for when he comes to know. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:57:14
This was like sanity cleaning.
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:23:41
You him?
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:14:42
All he is trying to say is anything is prone to fail. Also. West is not as strong as you think it is.

@_date: 2019-10-18 15:46:02
Yeah sure. oO
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:42:24
so you are saying that I can keep on investing till 2020? 
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:13:59
Dont take my advise on this but I think you should always take out profits occasionally.
@_date: 2019-10-06 17:39:24
Who's the hotty? Asking for blockchains.
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:08:02
China - wise market seem good. I expect these rates to hold on for a while. and given the short window for this growth, there will be a correction. Mass mentality would like to make profits. I am not sure how good of a correction that would be. 8-11% may be.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:18:42
I take profits out occasionally. Come party!

@_date: 2019-12-30 06:35:06


this is important than people assume it to be.
@_date: 2019-12-05 09:25:38
Surprisingly sub 7K prices with half an year to halvening is bit exciting and concerning.
