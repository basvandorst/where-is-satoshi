How so?

You think it has something to do with meltdown ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:22:32
I was thinking along the same lines. Hard wallets and paper wallet should be fine no ?

I was not elaborate because I was not sure what i wanted exactly. All i knew was i wanted to start making applications on bitcoin and contribute at least a little to bitcoin core , in terms of testing or any other small way (Jimmy song made a medium post that inspired me).
I need to start from the basics so I was looking for good starting points i guess. I finished the coursera course by princeton! kinda.. was wondering what i should do next. 
NimbleBodhi gave me a few links, if you have anything to add , that d be cool. thanks.

Huge fan of andreas! Saw the first one as soon as it was released. I understood a lot of what he was teaching(not entirely), but i was looking for something more rudimentary to start from learning the very basics of bitcoin. I think nimbleBodhi gave me a few places to start from. If you have any to add please do!

Ha...come on..extreme comparisons don't you think ?... But...I get it...from a certain perspective you could say it's something stupid... But I don't know... When they do it during the right occasions something makes me get excited ...you say you can do it...but it's not so simple...you need a bunch of people together to recite the same verses ....stomp and beat your chest and thighs in sync with everyone ...and in rythm...it's a performance !...and I enjoy it..

thank you. also,slightly off topic, how often do i have to keep changing the s9 ? How often does a new version of an ASIC come out? do the old one s become obsolete ? Do miners generally continue to add on to mining equipment the already have, swap them for new one s at a discount or just discard them and buy new ones?
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:18:35
I'm confused. If I can't change the addresses then don't only i have the private key of the receiving address(on both chains)? How do my coins get stolen then?

Holy shit! You just gave me the nonce to the next block! bitcointalk is awesome! I'm not an Australian and my guess is your are probably not either, but I can t think of a better way to say this, mate...you are a legend!

Best* resource to learn about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:39:25
right, i see what you mean. thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:51:16
thank you for that. very informative. Another question I have is can the difficulty adjust to a value so low that the current transaction volume can be accommodated , where there is no significant congestion in the network, with say 5 % of the current hashing power? If no , is there a percentage(of the hashing power) at which this becomes viable? I hope my question is clear. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:17:40
Yh I am I think. I just thought the efficiency of the new model might make economic sense to swap the old ones for new. I think I understood what your asking. When you say new hashing power , are you referring to new miners that would pop up world wide or how my new miners would add to the net hash rate of the old miners I have?

For bitcoin cash I used coinomi. although initially my coins were stored in a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:07:45
They are a good wallet in my experience , but right before the bitcoin-cash fork if you still had bitcoin in your jaxx wallet , it would ve taken a few days to receive your bitcoin-cash. Given that there is so much uncertainty on how wallets and exchanges will respond to the imminent hard fork , perhaps you should store it in a paper wallet. 
Although you should know there are risks associated with paper wallet and all precautions must be taken to ensure safe storage. 
You will find a link to the paper wallet website in the r/bitcoin FAQ Newcomers thread on top of the the r/bitcoin main page.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:17:49
Right. But doesn't that depend on whether we have an efficient market with rational players? Couldn't rhetoric or other tools of persuasion make traders pick one chain over the other?
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:12:45
I see. Very informative again. If you don t mind me asking. How do you know all this? Do you have any suggestions on which youtube channels or websites I could study this from or anywhere that provides this kind of information , specifically related to mining?
again thanks a ton! I ll probably keep asking you questions from time to time. If it ever gets annoying please don t hesitate to ask me to stop .
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:27:20
Have the same questions, hope someone answers these.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:41:53
Any suggestions on what resources I should read or watch on how to split the coins(safely) after the November fork ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:01:09
Interesting, honestly can't wait to see how the different dynamics of bitcoin plays out. While I've read a few experts stating that this is small in comparison to the threats bitcoin could potentially face in the future, as new user, this is probably the first major test of the nakamoto consensus that I'll be part of . Thanks for your insights.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:55:41
Did not realise that bitcoin.org had so many guides online! Should ve looked harder for it. I'll probably be using all your links! Thanks a lot !
