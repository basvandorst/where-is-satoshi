I run a node and I would rather you donate to the bitcoin devs. Bitcoind just barely runs on my vps with 2GB RAM and regularly runs out of memory.
Having a dedicated vps for my node is a significant cost and if the devs had more money to optimize it, im sure more people would run a node.

There is no mandatory deadline, you can set it as far into the future as you like. I will increase the default setting to something better in order to avoid misunderstandings.
As for the fees and minimum bounties:
* I will change the minimum bounty when the bitcoin rate changes considerably.
* I really want to keep the fees as low as I can and at the moment they are even lower then paypal and other services.
* Since mediation is often required, I have to pay someone to do this (myself at the moment). Depending on how intensive that is and how much I can automate this process I will lower the fees/minimum bounty as much as I can.
* I am also thinking about refunding bounty investors all fees if no mediation is required to have an incentive to avoid conflict and reward good behavior.

I think mobile phone wallets are the way to go for small daily amounts you spend where usability matters most and cold storage paper wallets for savings.
For example Mycelium looks pretty good and the upcoming features look promising.

Rewriting basic wallets has little value as it just creates more opportunity for bugs to arise. It is much more productive to audit and improve existing wallet software.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:29:36
Yeah because we all see what happens under regulation. The big banks bought the regulators and got a monopoly that way. Regulations are made so that small banks cant compete. If they go broke they get reworded for the incompetence by bailouts, which gives them an even more unfair advantage over the competent banks. Did I mention that with there monopoly they can push prices up and stop innovating?
Sounds like a shitty idea this regulation. I much rather let incompetent bad companies die in the free market and be better of for it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:28:45
I don't know much about it, so I will look into it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:49:18
That may actually be a practical solution. Since the nodes don't know which ones are copies they cannot do deduplication which make is just as expensive as playing honest and thus removes the incentive. We talked about this with super3 in chat and came to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:31:42


This is a hard problem and difficult to do without sacrificing security, the 10min cycle is there for a reason. That said I saw a proposal a wile back from an Israeli university on how to solve this and it will be addressed in the protocol some time down the road. 


This is largely an issue of bitcoin having a small market at the moment and will solve itself as bitcoin becomes more popular.


and against the privacy mantra, but such a service would appeal to the people that like the technology but are not necessarily attracted by the crypto-anarchist angle. Furthermore businesses would feel much more at ease with accepting orders from such accounts.
Thats not a bad idea, I will look into it. [bitcoin.de]( where I trade has high volume users identity get verified by the post office. Having verified addresses for businesses and passably a wallet plugin to help you transact with such addresses absolutely makes sense. Something like the https green bar in your browser. If I remember correctly there is a BIP for this and its getting added to the protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:00:57
[Electrum]( is pretty good. [BIP38 Paper Wallet]( for cold storage.

Well since they are small I guess you don't care to much about tax deduction anyway.

I had done research prior to this post. Read the white paper, looked at the github code and tried to contact them. Others did the same and all technical questions were ignored while questions about how to fund were answered right away. Everything looked like this was 100% marketing with not the slightest bit of technical understanding. Some though it was a scam other likes me though it was just naive and overconfident inexperienced developers. 
We ran into a dead end and needed to get them to talk and it took this post to get them to answer any questions, at all. I admit the wording could be better but there is no hostility between anyone here.
I am now convinced its not a scam and that they are actually perusing what they claim. They are naive and overconfident inexperienced developers but thats ok everyone starts out like that and you grow with your project. After talking to super3 I think he is a capable hard working cool guy that will make this happen.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:45:14

I would not send any bitcoin to this project. I looked at the github and see no source code for the core parts. All of my questions have so far remained unanswered and the white paper does not show how the protocol works.
To be specific what is the exact protocol of:
* storing data
* retrieving data (how do you know the client actually got the file)
* how does payment work (especially over time)
* what is the blockchain format and how does it work 
Most importantly how do you ensure redundancy?
Proof of storage is a trivial problem and not what has stopped decentralised data storage so far. "Proof of redundancy" is what we need! What is stopping me from creating thousands of nodes with one shared storage to increase my profit? Without "Proof of redundancy" the market forces will work towards the cheapest (least redundand) storage.
The reluctance to answer questions and increased posting of hype material is very concerning.

First heard of bitcoin in 2011 but though "this shit can never work, we cant even keep dns secure" (that was when they had to mass patch dns flaws before anyone noticed).
Took until 2013 for me to get familiar enough with the crypto to invest at ~100$ and cashed out a year later at about 800$ before "the" bubble burst.
Hold is the overall correct strategy, but since most of the value is speculation (thankfully less now) you have to know when your before or after a bubble and resist the hype.

 Disk space is not the issue I have. Bitcoind just barely runs on my vps with 2GB RAM and regularly runs out of memory.
I would rather see this problem addressed. If we want more nodes running it on a cheap vps should be prioritised.
@_date: 2015-04-24 11:26:08
How so, what is the advantage to running one at home?
I personally run a full node because I have applications using the api and I don't want to rely on other services. I think this is the reason many people run full nodes.
I think the fact that bitcoind consumes so much memory is part of the reason the number of nodes is dropping. The less resources it consumes the more people will run full nodes (mostly on small vps servers).

@_date: 2013-12-26 11:44:07
No if there is an actual flaw in the protocol it means its broken and you have to fix it asap and without anyone finding out before the updated software is released.
This is nearly imposable since it assumes 1. the flaw is discovered by a good guy that knows exactly how to deal properly with such a problem 2. all software is patched without anyone spilling the beans 3. everyone patches after the software is released.
More likely is a crash to zero and the death of bitcoin.
