WTF is wrong with you.

The obvious answer is to just re-gift the 1btc over the next couple of years in like $500 installments... still a pretty sweet gift!

I'm also switching over and got the same message. Coinbase did a shitty thing by adding BCH without explicitly announcing when they were planning on doing it. We need to show them that that's not okay.

I'm buying more. Tesla is finally about to be profitable. Are people really so blind?!

Completely agree, when I first started in crypto, bcash confused the hell out of me and only with further research did I figure out BTC was the one I wanted.

180000 very unfulfilling jobs

Do you enjoy your job? 9-5 working for some Asshole somewhere? Not at all fulfilled? These comments make me cringe...

This faq is not convincing at all.

If ubi doesn't work with current economics, then current economics will need to change

Hmm let's say autonomous trucking becomes a thing. I buy one autonomous truck and complete shipments for clients at a 50% discount to the manned trucks. Eventually I have enough autonomous trucks to replace every manned truck. All truckers go out of work. Smart businessmen will go for the discount rather than paying for the manned truck. Now what do all the out of work truckers do for money? What do all the shops and restaurant workers who relied on these truckers stopping in and spending money do? Isn't it something like 1/3 of American jobs are based around the trucking industry? What do you do in this scenario?

Please expand on your thoughts

I laughed when I read it, so the joke still has value to me. And having value, even just for one person, makes it

What do you suggest the masses do when there is a 70% unemployment rate due to automation. Which jobs will replace the ones that are lost? UBI is pretty much the only viable solution.

Hey, baseless theories are Rogers specialty. Or has everyone forgotten about his claims of Jack sleeping with the Lightning CEO because reasons?

You're the one who rallied the bcashers. Fuck you, you scammy fuck. They still use this 'example' to mislesd newcomers into thinking LN is bad. You contributed to their propaganda. Again, Fuck you.

I shorted ethereum last night because I don't know what I'm doing apparently. This pic hits home.

Might want to wait until August 16thish to sell. There's a big etf decision coming from the SEC. If it's positive news, the value of the bitcoin you hold could potentially triple by the end of the year. If you're not hard up on cash, might be worth it to wait a few weeks

same, anything I post just automatically gets downvoted. quite the echo chamber in there with the same ppl posting the same shitposts every other day.

Yep. Been trying to contact support for several weeks due to withdrawal problem and get nothing back. It's like a ghost town over there.
