The internet has many governing bodies and groups that set standards,policies and practices to provide a platform for freedom of use without these you wouldn't have the internet in its current form or more likely at all.

Well from the time you where born up until you fully leave, you probably made use of quite a few public works.  Ain't easy being a citizen.

Like I said man, i think you have plenty of reasons to renounce, especially  considering you situation, but you have to understand from any governments point of views its better to have your citizens live and work in your country.  If they don't live here that is a ton of lost local tax revenue, among other things.

Actually as a citizen anywhere you do owe the government "a thing" its part of the social contract and that contract benefits you greatly. You take from the whole to better you and yours life, all that is required is that you give back to the whole.  Its how society has worked for a long long time.

Yeah and the military isn't leaving the country and denouncing its citizenship either.  In fact it plays a huge role in the social contract as in protecting you so you can flourish in society.  The military is part of the roads, schools, water, safe airways (super part of this), etc etc(gonna say its also super part of this particular etc of no reason) etc.

Reactionary regulation isn't regulation.

Good luck find a place to exist not governed and enjoy trying to build the last thousands of years of progress through society by yourself.

Unless 40% of those people are near poverty levels of income. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:09:20
Yup, exactly.   Thats what those leaving fees are, taxes.   Its fine to leave, but you benefited greatly form the foundations and protections of society, so since your leaving and taking your education promise and work with you that was partially if not fully developed under the comforts of said society it shouldn't be so outlandish to expect a final taxation.  As the tax rate isn't you get what you put in, generally you get far more than you put in, especially in your younger years.

I meant things like roads, schools, water, safe airways, etc etc etc.

I'm not saying you don't have good reasons to drop your citizenship, I'm not saying america is perfect, but I am saying expecting not to pay good bye taxes is a little outlandish to me.

Governments are created by people, society was built by people, governing of people has been a huge part of society and the success of it.  If you can point me to a successful society without a government I'd love to read about it.

No other "first world" nations have nearly the amount of people we do either.  Its a whole different ordeal when there is this much land and this many people to govern.

You have no idea what a social contract is and thats hilarious.
