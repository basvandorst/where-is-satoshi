Coinbase iOS app downloads are  in finance and jumped 85% in the last week. IMO, they’re pertaining to new customers who don’t even know what Segwit is and are looking for a way to get rich quick.

Invest what you can afford to invest. Don't put all your money in at once, buy over time to average it out, and don't panic. If you believe in the technology, just remember you are actually looking for dips and corrections to buy more. Be greedy when others are fearful.

I agree. As a beginner, I used coinbase before knowing what gdax was. And it was super simple and user friendly.

oh yeah in this case it's BTC address..

Well they're basic trading terms. GDAX's interface is pretty nice for beginners. Learn about moving averages and candlesticks so you can understand the graphs. Then move to the order book and depth chart. Investopedia is a great resource to learn a little. Just remember, you are a small fish in an ocean of whales. 
I'd say after that you'll be on your way. Glad to help if you need it.

Yup, those are buy / sell limit orders on the left. Market size is the # of orders (in BTC) and Price is the price of those orders they want to buy/sell at (in $). Say the price is at $272.5 USD/ETH now. If I put in a limit order to buy 3 ETH at $270, then they'll show up on the left until that trade is hit. 
A larger market size means that there's more people trying to sell or buy at that specific price. Once a trade hits, you can see it on the right go through and, technically, the market size should reduce since that trade has been made. 
I like to think that watching these books and the candlesticks helps me tune into market psychology but in reality it's probably just a bunch of rich people messing with us. :(

Find the 'withdraw' button on the left.

I hear India has had a lot of problems with their paper currency. Blockchain would be a legit solution for them.

Buy on a weekly basis to dollar cost average and then let it sit. If you believe in the technology then you should be comfortable letting it sit.

No problem

Coinbase is more friendly to the general public who want to get in on the bitcoin action... think people who don't know the difference between a limit or market trade.

Reddit! But that’s mostly after the fact news.. like if you see a big dump, you would check on Reddit to see why.

A.A. gives me confidence in this technology.

Then go to ETH Address... Enter your wallet's address... and voila... good luck. Send a small portion first to test it out because if you mess up you get messed.
