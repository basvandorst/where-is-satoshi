The real trick is to already have it on the exchange.
Take a look:
1. Have 1 BTC on both exchanges.
2. Buy 0.*n* BTC on CheapExchange_A @ $12,000
3. Sell 0.*n* (the same amount) on PremiumExhcange_B @ $13,500.
4. Only move BTC if you need to "top up" PremiumExchange_B, or buy from PremiumExchange_B is ever lower than CheapExchange_A.

Maybe you read it wrong? You'd already have the BTC on exchange, you're not buying with fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:50:07
I had the same problem, had to contact support to resolve.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:40:49
GDAX or Coinbase?
Sending from GDAX is free.
EDIT: Obviously, it isn't free for GDAX, but for the user.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:28:49
Because the way you present your data is horrible.
Edit: Apparently I'm not alone in this thought.

Doh, NVM, you want to cash out.

It's still getting paid, but in much smaller amounts.

Ahhh yes, the myth of the eternal harddrive. I've only heard it spoken of once, but that was enough to pique my interest.
1. Go bigger than 256 GB, as the blockchain will grow.
2. External is fine, just run it for about 6 hours a day to keep it synced with the blockchain.
3. No need to go SSD, if its only purpose is the node. Plus those R/W speeds are moot if it runs on USB.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:30:57


Yep, you're mining LTC with a GPU. From the looks of it, you have lots of research to do, or, better yet, just buy the coin.

Pray NiceHack&amp;trade; comes back so "miners" like you can click the shiny "Pay Me!" button.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:03:16
You'll never time the market on CB and "hit" the dip. They purposefully charge large fees to cover the volatility of BTC price. [It's right on their support page.]( So, if BTC is $10, CB is going to charge you $12. You want to try and hit those dips, learn to use GDAX.

Had the same issue earlier today transferring to my Ledger. Took a few hours to sync up but it's all there, from legacy to SegWit addy.

For the same reasons you should have read the sidebar before posting a question that is answered x,xxx times per day.

And it's still so early!
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:18:22
I still see it, as an arbitrary number (I see 10M+), instead of a more exact value (last I checked it was 13,100,000).
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:02:35
I don't disagree. That would be absolutely noticeable. One, maybe not.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:44:49
There are services that do this, mainly [bitwage.com](

I like your style. Thanks for sharing.

True, it says on their site they add to the total in case of "market fluctuations" etc..

Oh, you want spoon fed. I bet next you'll ask if now is a good time to buy/sell/hodl.

Agreed, but there are situations where access to electricity without the obligation to pay for it is a reality. For instance, I'm a server admin, and my company has a server room. In said room, I have a full node running 24/7, completely free to me.
Sure, I'm not mining, but if I wanted to I could, albeit at tiny fractions of a bitcoin. It would be passive income that I'm not paying to maintain.

If you're looking at CoinHive, it mines Monero, and they take 30%.

Not only has it been answered, but r/bitcoin sees more of these posts per day than quality content. You could have had your answer with a quick search. 
It's actually quicker to search for your answer than wait for one. Also, checkout r/bitcoinbeginners, they might be more forgiving of these posts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:10:32
I'm in a similar situation, I have some server room space to give back to the community. So far, all I'm doing is running a full node, but I've looked into running several of the [USB power strips with the BM1384](
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:26:28
That's just it. People who think they are investing in a meme factory run by internet kids and neckbeards won't invest. It's not going to help Bitcoin grow.

I generally agree with this statement, but we're still in FOMO mode ATM. Be greedy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:02:01
ATM's provide receipts of your transaction. What does it say?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:08:55
Is the code open source?
What makes it better than Blockfolio? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:53:17


Ummmm. You're wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:28
They are different exchanges, therefore exchange at different rates. They tend to follow one another, but sometimes one gets a little astray from the others.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:32:46
Are you starting from the Oct 11 jump or the rebound on Sept 14?
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:11:23
Is your software open source?
What makes CryptoManager better than Blockfolio (arguably the current leader in this app market)?
