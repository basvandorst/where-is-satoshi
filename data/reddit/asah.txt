Local and artisan food from our network of 2,600 producers (bbfdirect.com), including snacks.  The big thing, is you can taste everything before you buy.
Also really popular for holiday gift shopping because we have $5 shipping across the country and $5 local delivery in SF.

That's my shop!  We actually have 3 locations in SF, and been in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes and Wired.
If you want to support the cause, tell your friends in SF about our new office snack delivery service:
P.s. confirmation should be fast now: we integrated properly with coinbase.

Thx for the shout out, indeed we carry an eclectic mix of the best artisan food and gifts, treats for yourself or others.  Behind the scenes, we're actually the world's leading marketplace (bbfdirect.com) for 14,000+ stores to discover new products, and for 2,700+ young brands to get to market.  The largest part of our business is delivering office snacks to the top companies in SF and the bay area, who give it away to employees (
We've been accepting Bitcoin since April 2013: we wrote our own POS which made out easy.  These days, we process about one transaction a day.  The last couple of months, we've seen a bit of an uptick.  We have corporate snack customers who pay in Bitcoin, and that's a lot of money!

can confirm: redditors are petty and mean.

It's really true!  thanks to localbitcoins.com and other directories, we really are seeing bitcoiners every day in the stores.
My hats off to Sarah Needleman and Annie Pritt @ WSJ -- not only did Sarah get her facts straight, but she and Annie captured the "sentiment" perfectly and were generally one of the nicest and most thoughtful reporters and photojournalists I've met: unlike the drive-by writers I'm used to in the tech world, Sarah asked me a ton of good questions and Annie spent tons of time in the store, while my staff and I helped customers and nobody felt weird about having a WSJ photographer hanging around, indeed Annie joined us for tastings (you can taste anything in the store, and every day 100s of people take us up on that).
Today, I was reminded of the power of bitcoin, when the story hit and I needed to Eat Something Now [1] and needed to buy a snack from the store [2][3], and had to cough up $3.37.  As I'm fussing with pennies, I'm wondering-- wouldn't a QR code with 0.03272 just be a lot easier?
[1] yes, a real problem in the food business.
[2] yes, we pay
[3] yes, we give ourselves a big fat discount :-)

We just finished integrating bitcoin into our point of sale (POS) system:

Hi-- actually, we're both wholesale *and* have 3 retail locations in San Francisco.  While we'll accept bitcoin for either, I doubt there's much interest in wholesale.
proof:   :-)

This is so cool &amp; unexpected, and the free bitcoin-it-forward ice cream is awesome!
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:33:06
actually we do bitcoin back, it was a simple API call to our provider, who sends email with the instructions to collect the bitcoin.  We put in limits to deter hacking and we limit the amount of btc in the source wallet.
the POS interface is super easy, in fact we've had problems because staff expect it to be more complex.
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:34:19
sorry!  how do you use bitcoin?  (being more traffic than wsj.com/path/to/article)
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:51:19
yep, we can help: we work with 7,000 retailers.  Large chains can be tricky because of slow-moving POS systems upgrades and extreme pickiness about speed-of-checkout.  But, smaller retailers, farmer's market stalls, etc. can simply install an app on their tablet, smartphone or laptop browser - and away they go.
(for extra security, check confirmations via email)

Hi!  I am that grocer -- and in fact, we just added the ability to sell bitcoin too at all three locations.
Please do NOT donate BtC to us-- we want you to visit the stores, enjoy good food, bring it home and share with friends!
