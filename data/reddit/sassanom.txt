Thank you, I mention the article in mine (search for: "this guy did some crash test").
Interesting idea you have about the app to show QR code metadata. It's a pain in the *** to do it by hand :)

Have you read the post?

"Uncrop" ! :')

It was a giveaway, Roger destroyed the private key and the journalists were forbidden (by law) to show it on TV. We would not 
have done this if it was unethical.

It was about Bitcoin, just Roger Ver saying Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin cash.

Yes, BCH, sorry. I modify my comment

I'm not an expert but I think the show has to be classified as an "entertainment" show (this TV show was a documentary) by the CSA (Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel). They regulate radio and TV in France. You should have something similar in your country.

Hello, as I said in a previous comment, TV and radio contents are regulated in France (like in other countries I think). They can't display the QR code because it would be like a cash game. This is possible to do in France, but the show has to be classified as an entertainment show, which was not the case of this show. It's a documentary.

Yep, saw this during my research.

He gave BCH.

Maybe 12 hours to find the key, 6 to write the post.
