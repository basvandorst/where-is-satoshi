I will try to do the same. My brother's wedding is in the near future and i'm thinking of giving him an envelope with $200 worth of BTC instead of real money. Should be an interesting gift.

I understand what you're saying and i think i know a few people like the ones you describe. Money has been tight in the last few months .... i've changed city and jobs, i had to spend more than usual in the new city to find accommodation and make it livable. I had to get a small loan from the bank just to be able to pay the bills and get food until my first paycheck. I wasn't expecting spending this much money in the new city but i guess the capital is far more expensive than the little town i'm from...anyway... i feel that better days are close, if not with bitcoin maybe with the new job, maybe both:)

I remember when i tried Mturk about 5 years ago. I slaved for a year to make $110, my country was not eligible for tasks that paid good money so i spent a year clicking pictures or matching traffic objects etc. But in the end i was happy with what i made and bought something nice for me and my brother.

Where i live $160k is a lot of money, 60% of the country will not make that in a lifetime ( the whole family combined ).
I will try to buy more when i have money to spare. I don't want to get filthy rich from this. Anything i get will be a happy bonus.

What can i say ... i never had much money, 80$ means a lot to me even now. Maybe i'm not from a rich country like you or come from a rich family. Where i live 80$ is still half of minimum wage, and i'm not far from minimum wage...
So yeah... 80$ is all i could spare to invest and not be affected.
