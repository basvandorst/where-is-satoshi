Use a throwaway email (loads on google) and say something along the lines of "this is [your redacted name, as spelled by them, only] please provide proof as jpg **only**" or along those lines, don't go opening files in the reply on a *personal device*.  Only use information they have provided in their written text and nothing else (don't add your real email address as they should know that already, or only a partial address, for example, "abc************* hell, make them work for it... 
It would be a bad idea for them to use natural language ("Proof of Authorship" is a great forensic tool).
Also, start unplugging/covering your cameras :P , or, at the very basic simple level, anti-virus software has built-in webcam blockers/warnings, I think Kaspersky does but anti-virus isn't bullet proof.  When I first started learning stuff like this, you'd be surprised how easy this is when the software has already been written (think "script kiddie" as opposed to "1337 h4x0r")...

I would try and make it fun... Look into Arduino/Raspberry Pi if you're a physical type like I was and like getting your hands dirty, you can make some cool projects of your own or follow some excellent ones already out there.  If you would like to try apps and software, and enjoy more "book" oriented work, Java is a good place to start with WYSIWYG editors for a visual feel, or Python (I've never fully tried Python though).
