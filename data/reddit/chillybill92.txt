Is the Risk worth the Reward? Risk vs. Reward. You can ask yourself this to just about everything before you do anything. Just invest what you are willing to lose. I started investing in June and slowly kept buying more and more every other week. My only regret is that I didn't buy more.

Good job. Even if it drops I know it will go up from whatever price you are buying it for as time goes on. $

Yeah for sure. It might fall below $3400 today because of that too.

Who wants to work for paper money that can be printed off continuously in unlimited supply while there are only 21 million bitcoin that can't be made anymore?

True that. If only we could time the market perfectly. I'll think about it. It might be a good idea to wait.

To some people 1k is a lot at any age.. I feel bad for those some people. I guess people don't ever want to own a house or a boat anymore. OP you're 16 1k is nothing in the adult world.

I upvoted this but I see your point. I'm happy because I will buy more today at some point. So much going on right now. I'm happy to buy more for the long run. Nothing to worry about.

The second Amazon accepts it is the day I dump every penny into BTC. I would even sell everything I can to buy more ASAP.

I'm just looking forward to $1 trillion market cap which means $47k bitcoin

The good thing about BTC is that we don't have to buy a full coin either
