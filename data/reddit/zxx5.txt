There will be only **21 MEGAZILLA**s in this world ROFL
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:16:00
I believe you could do that, but manually.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:34:04
from satoshi point of view yes, who ever got more than 10 BTC is a **megalodon** lol  
that,s 1,000,000,000 *(1b.)*  Satoshi  
I might do another 'animal' analogy photo with BTC perspective.  
*I need bigger animals maybe dinosaurs hehheehh*

I repeat, FOMO alert! rofl

There will be only 2.1 **Quadrillion**  Satoshi in this world, stack stack stack!  
*(2,100,000,000,000,000)*  
in *BTC-core*

Too many **awareness rising**, I don't think it can hit that low, we might not see $3-4K anymore, just as we won't ever see BTC hit $100. unless something catastrophic happens..  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

fee are the sea virus hahah, good one! fee in BTC sucks for real, but is what makes BTC safe  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

into satoshi perspective point of view, yes, is just an analogy within satoshi only.  
1billion satoshi *(10BTC)* would be equal to a **Megalodon** lol

generally asking, how can the supply get cut? specially in half   ('◑.◑)
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:50:27
Is this even accurate? And dash for been low supply would be very high in value for that amount of cap. Lol
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:19:24
wouldn't that decrease miners?

interesting, a way for the anti-Christ to get his throne in the world, but as the Holy Bible predicts, Jesus Christ will **dethrone** lucifer out of here... so his power is limited, whereas Gods' isn't. New World Order: soon a city near you, highly recommend Dr. Kent Hovind for further more prediction of our future, **only** Christ can save us from eternal torment..
*16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads, 17 and* ***that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark*** *or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.*
(Tribulation, Rapture, God's Wrath, Armageddon, Peace):
Jesus' returns in 2028? (strong hypotheses shows yes) the END is truly near ⚠️:

**Q U E S T I O N S**  
Are the 'blocks' finite? if not is there a limit to numbers of process to reach (within the 'nodes'), or can block 1 look the same as block 5, because of time/date sensitive or something ?  
What happens when all BTC are mined, when mining becomes useless, will BTC still be valued? and if they all stopped the computer power to validate transaction could BTC "break"?
