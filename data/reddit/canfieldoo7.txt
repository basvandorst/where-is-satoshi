Seems like it’d make for a slippery slope in regulating crypto itself since exchanges are how the vast majority get them in the first place.  Not everyone is savvy enough to use things like TOR, VPNs etc.

Can anyone link me to somewhere that details how to set up a LN node using a raspberry pi?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:18:24
I’d have to say that because of the internet’s proliferation that this process will be drastically sped up

Hahaha it looks a lot different on a phone:

Could the futures contracts expiring have anything to do with this?  Big players using it to spread FUD to drop the price?  Or perhaps it’s just because the bubble burst (one of the many times) and the majority of those that were just seeking a money grab aren’t using it, as mentioned in an earlier post.  ����‍♂️

Wouldn’t ‘insider trading’ imply that someone would want regulations on crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:23:33
Link or screenshot please?

You should share a link to email/call them, people are lazy and don’t want to search for it themselves.

Ok I saw that, I thought they had a disclaimer stating ‘WE DONT SELL ACTUAL BITCOIN’ or something of that nature.  Idk why but I would’ve found that hilarious 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:10:38
That’s awesome.  Is there a way to get those coins swept into a wallet if I used an exchange to purchase them initially?

I had to upload my ID with a .jpeg file, using my computers camera failed multiple times before I tried this.  Went through in ~30mins
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:32:25
No, I learned the hard way watching the price go from $8k to $16k
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:12:13
Been using that for months.  Not sure what exchange it follows but it gets the gist of it
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:12:05
But GDAX takes a week to transfer and CoinBase locks your price in
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:10:47
Damn, that’s what I thought.  Thank you

What is ELI5?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:19:27
Well that would explain why Google couldn’t return a result when I looked for ELI5 Tech pertaining to crypto lol

The last step seems to be profit so I’ll click buttons until numbers appear

Hell yes, great idea and awesome links

Seems like he’s starting to feel out the perspective on it to try and bring it up in Congress.  Not sure how to feel about that...
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:52
But the real question is, how do I mine it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:32:52
7.62x39 is more plentiful worldwide

Their trading platform is missing a good deal of information that most platforms have.  Either way for people who are essentially just gambling with Crypto it will be a magnet for them since it doesn’t cut into profits.  Personally I’m excited for it though because it helps bring more people into crypto much faster and easier.

Can’t you do this starting at 10k?  It all depends on the angle/pivot of your mean line.  If we look at the trends since it first started trading it’s about where it should be right now.
If this is the case though I’m gonna be loading up on more BTC at 5k and 4K since no one knows where the bottom truly is

You can’t eat gold or use it to hunt.  I’ll take guns and bullets over gold

Kind of like fiat currency backed up by hopes and dreams

Salt used to be a more valuable commodity to trade with than gold too.

There’s a link that’s often posted for consumer complaints.  They get resolved almost immediately that way.
Maybe someone could be kind enough to post it for us
