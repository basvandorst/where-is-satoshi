[Smile Train]( is one of the best charities I know. Simply getting every kid in the world on the same physical starting level (looks wise) makes all the difference to compete. Not being able to smile can destroy a person.

Enjoy life now. You could get hit by a car tomorrow. Don’t throw away your money, but don’t live life being miserable for money.

Greed. Crypto folks want to be the new banks..ie, rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:24:40
 Nothing to pay, asks nothing of you. This is how I learned to live life in the moment. That and being a poor artist.

“newspapers”, haha

“Collecting”, not “using”? Steam cutting off support and less and less people using is turning this into a Ponzi scheme when it really isn’t one.

The other option is so give smaller amounts to many charities, but give the bulk to one that you really connect to; like creating solar energy for third world states like Puerto Rico. 
Keep up the great work!

Dammit. I had zero reason to transfer them. Thanks for the heads up.

I would have said all of Trump's Chief's of Staff so far, but sure, I like yours too. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:04:09
Thanks for that. I see you point on almost all of that, but my rebuttal is if the vast majority of people are HODLing their Bitcoins in it's infancy stage and using them as, in essence, a stock, then there isn't a reason for small businesses to invest in the infrastructure to accept it. My current company waited till the last second possible to purchase CC CHIP tech and that was only because it became mandatory in the US. In a true Free Market, nothing happens until the need hits a tipping point. How much usage is Bitcoin getting during this massive influx in "value"?
And these aren't "Troll" questions as C- student /holeinthefoam accused. I'm actually wondering how a tipping point will occur if Bitcoin investors don't use it en masse. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:45:57
No, my concern is that it's ridiculous to use my Bitcoin that I bought at $3K because it's "return" is so high right now if I sold it. So instead of using Bitcoin, I'm sitting on it. How does that help the cause to switch to Bitcoin internationally? The other issue is the USD may fluctuate, but it fluctuates for everyone else, not for people living here using USD on a daily basis. So Bitcoin is like the stock market for people who use USD and we don't use stocks as currency (for the most part). I don't trade stocks for food or clothes. 
Edit: I added the last line.

Ahhh. I got an email from Coinbase and didn't fully understand what they meant and only now checking in. It's ridiculous when insulting sarcasm is clearer than a two page email, haha. You should create emails for companies moving forward.

No, it wasn't anything close to proper grammar. 
Option 1: And do you mind explaining what "theoretical value" is, exactly? 
Option 2: And do you mind explaining, exactly, what "theoretical value" is?
Theoretical Value:

Stop saying "free" education. it's not free if our tax dollars pay for it. This is what pissed me off about Bernie. "Universal" education is the proper nomenclature. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:33:07
Oh, absolutely, but only if the value continues to rise. If, over the next few years we see more volatility, I personally wouldn't accept it over USD, which for the most part is the most consistent stable currency in the world. I think you also have a different viewpoint than most small businesses though, just by being on here.  But I get your point. It will be interesting to see, if it does happen, if it's a gradual adoption, or if it happens because of a market irregularity, like the collapse of an economy. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:17:42


That makes a ton of sense. Thanks. I envision the hard part of that will be convincing employees and vendors to accept it or else it will be useless for the business.

Returns on investment. 
Sarcasm aside, discussing my actual concerns might be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:08:09
Ahh, I see, I added an "S" to benefits. I thought you were on acid. But the comma wasn't the issue on your comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:58:06
Thanks for the lead.

What’s the best for casual miners?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:51:53
Finally, someone who’s willing to acknowledge the similarities. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:58:26
Really? ZERO?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:48:41
"explaining what is "theoretical value" exactly" 
Grammar police ftw. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:28:08
Sorry, I realize I wasn't clear. I meant more, do we have a real timeline because people are starting to invest more time and energy into mining but seems to be on a downward trajectory in terms of reward to energy output ratio. I think we need to start projecting how viable it is to invest money and resources at this phase. Has anyone done any kind of serious projection/timeline based on current regional energy costs?
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:47:21
Feasibly how much longer is this going to be useful as more cryptos move to PoS and/or DAG? Once the last BTC is mined, are people going to continue running their energy intensive rigs any longer? Especially with Segwit fees being so low and LN going mainstream?
