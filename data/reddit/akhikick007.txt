Beacuse currencies are being printed by central banks and regulated by government. On the other hand people have a choice to choose bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not a currency but can be a consideration for the goods and services provided. The main difference between currency and bitcoin is that the  former is being accepted by public out of compulsion/ no choice , on the other hand bitcoin is a choice and being accepted out of own will by the people that makes bitcoin a bitcoin and not a currency.

And why people think who ever is asking for donations on this forum are scammers?
some people are genuine and they need support.
It's ok if you don't help but don't make fun of the person
who has put his ego aside and literally asking for help
from other community members. It's ok everyone faces 
a bas phase in their in lives and sometimes you will loose 
nothing if  you helped those in need.
