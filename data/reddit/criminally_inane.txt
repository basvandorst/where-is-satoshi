I bought in at a few times over a week between 16k and 18k-ish, and I'm slightly annoyed that I got in at a local maximum. But I knew that could happen, and while I put in a somewhat substantial (for me) amount, I can afford to lose it all if it comes to that. I can't imagine what I'd be doing right now if I'd put all of my savings in ~~beanie babies~~ bitcoin.

This isn't a "nobody knows for sure there's no god" situation though, there's a very real chance the next dip/correction is the big one that brings Bitcoin down to under $20 and keeps it there. I don't personally believe it's going to happen soon, but in this case you truly *don't know*.

Meaning I'm a bit of a sucker? :P

I don't trust myself to recognise any of those while they're still going, and from experience I'm right not to. I'm not expecting to go rags to riches, I'm happy with a fancier rag.

Nah, I'll stick around. I'm probably much closer to the "quick buck" people than the true believers, having bought in at 16k, but I knew this could happen, and I didn't put in more than I could afford to lose (even though it'll sting a bit if I do) so I'll stay in the gamble and cross my fingers.

Heh, fair enough. I wasn't expecting the "quick buck" to be all that quick anyway, so as far as I'm concerned this is just a decorative feature in the price graph.

If bitcoin ever keeps me up at night out of worry, that's when I'll sell enough of it that it no longer is. I value my economic stability, and I won't let myself be in a position where it could all crumble because someone found out that P=NP or something. Can't dream about lambos if I can't sleep in the first place :P
