I almost spent an entire paycheck on them then. Now I can't afford one with an entire paycheck.

Doesn't it have something to do with birds... Or Kevin Spacey?

No need to preach to me about the government sucking, but you do owe a debt to other people in society or it is at least right to help those with much worse situations. Don't view it as paying the government but just as one mechanism to help those who are in a terrible situation. Yes it's inefficient and maybe a complete charity system would be better (i have serious doubts here) but a huge portion of our taxes go to pay for medical care to those who can't afford it, food, and housing, not to mention education. Taxes paid for your education if nothing else so it is a kind of pay it forward.
Perhaps not the best method in the end but currently there's no political way forward to reforming welfare properly and I would rather end subsidies to the military-industrial complex before taking away some poor families healthcare.

Paying taxes to the welfare state is exactly "paying the fortune forward". There's probably better systems but its something.

Oh, do you mean the police?

I'm here too. *Headsmash repeatedly for stupidity* Maybe it will go away the dumb.

Until they propose this, this senator has really said nothing of value.
