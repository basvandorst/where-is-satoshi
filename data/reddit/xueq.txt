You have to remember that there's people who have millions in crypto now. Those people would rather just be able to spend their crypto then go through the hassle of transacting it to usd. 
That's why you can buy lambos and McLaren's with btc now.

Im a legacy fan boy 
Back in my day people shilled legacy coins as the only ones that would survive.

I love the speculation behind some dude just shaking the change in his pockets. Makes me bullish asf.
 Even if this is just a speculative asset, if that were me I wouldn't want to dump my precious coins. Just cash out a mil or two, invest another mil or two in stocks, a mil in ETFs, and precious metals. 
Go to sleep on a beach in Spain and forget all about money and stress of work. Ah fuck I hope crypto makes me rich
