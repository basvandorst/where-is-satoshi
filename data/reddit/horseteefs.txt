I would respect this post way more if you cut the shit and spoke why you are actually here- to sell your crap. Not get “feedback” on something that took zero skill and very little time to make in the first place. You are obviously not artistically or creatively inclined enough to even act on critique given. 
So my feedback as an honest person: 
-cut the shit.
My feedback as a fellow artist:
- cut the shit.
- make original shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:14:25
Also, I started to contact the artists responsible for the original design that was stolen. They usually don’t take lightly to this kind of stuff. I’d suggest removing this post as well as any of your stolen designs. Thanks

So by ‘made’ you mean you jacked a logo, uploaded it on a site that randomly and not very well placed on objects? Cool.

Gemini is 100% better than coinbase. Stay away from coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:29:42
Well said. These are the responses I am looking for- thank you

This post has spoiled entitlement written all over it. If you are profiting and want mommy and daddy to approve of you “good lifestyle”- move out.

No chance in hell 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:59:12
What the fuck are you arguing here? The post clearly says by 2018, which starts on January 1st. Otherwise the post would have said by 2019. Shut the fuck up, you dickhole.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:37
Cool, thanks for contributing nothing to this conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:17
I’m not looking forward to it all and I have a lot to lose in this case but I can’t wait to come back here after the dip. Conversation is so depressing when you are falling from cloud 9. Just think about all the new uneducated money coming in for the quick popular get rich quick dream. As soon as it drops a few hundred bucks, people are going to panic sell quick! 
My dad panic texted me last night at 2 am when it dropped 300 bucks in a minute haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:40:12
I agree with this. It will get interesting. Im at a point where now where I would I’m not even worried about my own finances, I’m looking for coins of the future for my newborn twin girls. I’m just starting to really think it’s not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:25:17
“by 2018” = by the time 2018 gets here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:23
What the hell are you even talking about? Sounds like the first sentence of a serial killers manifesto. Go back to your tent in the woods, the grid can’t handle your psychosis.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:52:48
THIS IS WHAT I CAME FOR! Facts. I appreciate your input.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:31:24
Have you even taken a second to think about what would have to happen for a 500+% increase from this already inflated price in 12 days? Optimism is a great thing but come on man.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:13:47
Good luck finding something that doesn’t exist.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:07:44
You must not have read his post properly, which is even funnier because the reminder will just remind you that you can’t read now. Hopefully in 4 months your skills will have improved.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:22:26
This post was meant for people like you to come in and talk facts. Give me reason to be optimistic and I will listen. I’m very much on the fence here. I’ve already taken my goal profits from my investment, at this point it’s all play money to me. I just want to make the right moves to get to my goal of paying off my house.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:06:15
If you had a project due “by Thursday at 8am” and you turn it in at 8:01, it’s late. 
If you have a mortgage payment due “by January 1st” and you pay it January 2nd, you are late and paying a late fee...
See what I’m saying, dickhole
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:42:49
So what you are telling me, you think it’s a bad time to sell but also could be a great time to sell? Quality input
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:12
Find me an exchange that doesn’t require that information. They all do to avoid fraud as well so think of it as protection for you as well. Taxes are a requirement for people in the US, so plan for that. 
There are more advanced options in Gemini with limit, market pricing options. 
And you can’t look past the difference in fees...
Gemini = .25 cents when buying $100
Coinbase = $2.99 when buying $100
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:48:03
Reason? Or is this a guess?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:18:51
Great information thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:18:14
Yeah I don’t think I would take it all out of crypto in general. I am invested in a couple of other coins as well. But I had 50% into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:02:12
Mine must be taking the long route because a 250 sat is going on 4 hours now 
And I have had lower ATM fees in Times Square- fuck this coin
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:15:17
Paying fees to transfer from my trezor to an exchange, then to cash out? Anything more than 5% of my initial money is more than I would like to throw away.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:37:58
I guess we will see. I would consider 40-50,000 I would be hesitant but welcome that prediction. 100,000 would have to be a huuuuge amount of money coming in
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:18:17
Yes- this all day! Reddit got unbearable during both the surge and fall. Thank fucking god for lightning because I started losing my mind waiting on a transaction from trezor to exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:58
The newcomers are shitting cheap coins and I’m feasting - wait, you know what I mean
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:00:51
Suck it
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:19:29
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:47:56
Jesus Christ, do your research before shitting out newbie questions. 
Short answer- No.
Longer answer in question form- Would you feel more safe with your cash in your pocket or handing it to a stranger to keep it safe? 
Do your research, read about hacks and the ridiculous amount of money that has just vanished.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:02:41
It’s not a bad idea- I wouldn’t advise jumping in with that kind of money right now due to the uncertainty of the future. But you also have to look at it the other way as well. What happens if the next dip is from $20,000 down to $15,000 per bitcoin? You effectively lost the opportunity for a lower buy in while you waited. It’s all such a guessing game. We can all give you our thoughts but there really is no way of knowing for sure
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:28:24
On January 14th, 2018 it will hit an all time high of $11,357. It will unfortunately fall to $3,449 in early February, then level out around $10,580 for the entire month of February with minor swings of a couple hundred dollars. March is going to an exciting month overall, that’s when we will really see it take off... all the way up, either to the moon but at least up your mom’s ass.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:46:19
Are we serious with this? Welcome to crypto.., now hopefully your first drop put a little hair on your balls or sell now and never look back. This is not the first and certainly not the last.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:54:17
These are great! Where are you located? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:21:29
Keep reading! But again, it all depends on your investment. Are you leaving $100 bucks worth on there? Do you care that it’s technically not your coin? Because that’s what it is, you are paying a service to hold x amount of coin for you. What happens if it gets hacked/shutdown/out of business? Bye bye coin and cash. 
If you are planning on investing and sitting on it with intentions of going to the moon, do yourself a favor and skip all the crap you will read about software wallets and online wallets and just invest in a trezor or ledger. Both are user friendly, easy as shit. And secure 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:01:13
Gemini 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:06:27
This is the type of comment that give people false hope for the future. Buying now for a newcomer is a terrible idea. Too many people are encouraged by the current rise and comments here really thinking that this is an easy get rich quick plan- then freak out and lose a shit ton of money when they panic sell during a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:41:29
I like Gemini because I can transfer money and they credit your account to buy coin immediately. You can’t move the coin from there until the money clears but at least you are locked in at the price you were looking for. Fees are MUCH lower than coinbase. I’m pretty sure I paid .25 per $100.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:51:09
My thoughts exactly! I have my account loaded up and all!
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:13:22
Optimistic- I like it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:18:09
I’ve been using Gemini and am very happy. 
Trevor wallets are very simple, plug and play. Trevor walks you through the process step by step. I remember how nervous I was with transferring my first Bitcoin to my trezor but all worked out. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:12:32
Dump on a high, wait for FUD drop then buy back in. Do this a few times while prices are this fluid and you will have one coin before you know it. Then sit still and watch that grow. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:35:25
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:40:37
This is true- I guess it’s all unknown
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:29:46
I’m also confused on this and how it’s impossible... I don’t do this but just seems like a perfectly good plan. As much as we know about the crazy swings of value- if I buy 2000 dollars worth during a dip, wait for a it to rise a bit and sell off and repeat, how could that not be possible unless you are doing this on a solid decline but then you wouldn’t be selling, just waiting around. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:56:14
This week? Give it a few hours...

Haha yes! Definitely not buy one get one free.

You also banking on buying a dip after the fork? I’m so hesitant to wait. I have my account loaded and ready to pull the trigger quick

I hope this is a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:36:58
Personally I think it’s a lost cause asking this community that question. You are going to get a lot of conflicting opinions. My opinion, if you intend on being in crypto long term, just make the investment into a hardware wallet unless you trust your own security knowledge. 
Read through some of the stories of people who have had a ton of money swiped out quick even with all possible security measures taken. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:46:27
You are serious enough to put this same question on 3 subs hours apart? Holy shit seek help paranoid! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:54:23
God damn it! I almost pulled the trigger earlier this week but my wife went ahead and had twins. Messed up my financial flow!

@_date: 2017-10-14 01:51:22
My guess is that the new comers were initially lured in by the bitcoin name and growing popularity of bitcoin itself- id be willing to guess a good amount of them don’t even realize other coins exist or understand the real importance of crypto. Because of that, I’m not worried about much of that. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:24:37
This is true but what is your intention with investing in crypto to begin with? If you believe in the product behind the dollar signs, more reason to keep your keys in your own pocket. If you are speaking of stashing away coin until you win the lottery (that could be a pipe dream or not, who knows?), then wouldn’t investing in a hardware wallet early make sense considering exchanges have already proven to be VERY unreliable at this point? A simple phish and BOOM, say goodbye to your precious investment.
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:49:08
Gotta love the flip flop

I agree with you 100%.. I guess it’s my own trust issues with the banks and government.

Can someone PLEASE end this conversation about wallets- it’s so easy to comprehend . Do not store your coin on coinbase! Get a trezor or ledger for Christ sake! It is literally on every post on reddit. The dead horse has been beaten into a bloody pulp.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:52:15
That’s one thing I don’t get, what is keeping big banks or whole countries from creating their own technology that they can finance themselves and wipe out all independent cryptos? I think it’s crazy to think the bigwigs are ever going to give up any power.

@_date: 2017-10-08 12:20:27
This is great! My wife recently gave birth to twins. I have been working really hard to get them a Bitcoin each. These prices better dip quick or one is going to be out of luck.
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:52:27
I’ll never understand the mentality of people who saw the explosion last year and then bought recklessly with no concern for the inevitable reversal. 
That being said I’m sorry it happened to you.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:06:55
Yeah true I can totally understand that. Im just saying that first time buyers could have used a bit more caution especially If something has never reached that current level at such a quick pace. I’m happy that I didn’t have money to spend on the way down as I just had twins and lost our second income to my wife staying home with them. I would probably have been buying these dips on the way down. 
Let’s hope for all of us that we do see 100 grand in the future!
