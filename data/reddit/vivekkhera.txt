That’s not the buyers problem.

How does one actually accelerate them? Do you have to tag them somehow as a miner?

If your business actually earns money, you can spend it on such things. I would ask an actual accountant if I unearned income can also be spent on such expenses for tax benefit. 
As for asset protection, if the sole purpose the LLC exists is for shielding assets it will be pierced by a court. If you are the sole owner of the LLC expect that to happen.

I got mine from hodlmoon.com
I paid using litecoin so you’re welcome for the value of that going up triple since then. :-)

I have been wondering this. On what authority is this based?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:53:59
I got mine ready for tomorrow night. :-)

That’s not how charities work. They will always liquidate whatever asset you give them and reallocate it as per their charter and investment strategy. You cannot make them do otherwise.

Wouldn’t that be considered barter?

How exactly would that happen if you only load the keys in a local BCH software wallet? I can see it if you upload your keys to an online web based wallet and the host is unscrupulous.

So you need someone else to answer this for you yet you expect people to hand over millions of dollars to you to manage? Not likely.

They’re not bits if they are not cut into 1/8ths.

Do you have an amazon account? Load them up into your wallet as amazon credit then buy something.

So if I run a client that has the whole chain locally, nobody else ever sees my private keys. Is that safe?

As a pass through entity any capital gains or losses will be on your tax return. So no, there is no advantage tax wise.

Did you account for transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:22:56
Plus your share of transaction fees until the end of time.

I run a full node already. The other day I did some upgrades and such and it was down for a few hours. On restart it needed about 80 blocks. It was also ungodly slow even with 40+ network connections on a gigabit line. 
I think there is somewhere you can download a big hunk of he historical block chain to speed up the process but other than that I don’t think so.

I guess you’re expecting it to not make it out of orbit let alone hit the moon.

If you form an LLC you have to file a tax return for the LLC itself every year. I would say not worth it. Be sure your trading account has proper beneficiaries so you don’t lose access to the money not converted to btc.

As code is developed, updates to files are committed to a central repository of that project's code. This tracks all the changes over time. At some point in time, someone decides to release the current set of files as the next version (usually after quite a bit of testing). This is called "tagging" a version -- a label is given to all of the files in the repository at their current version. From this, the actual distributed runnable program binary is built. By having tags, it is easy to compare the changes to the files relative to that release at a later time.

So if you made $100k profit on selling a stock then reinvested the money in another stock that lost you $100k, you still owe cap gains on that $100k. That you do not have the money is immaterial. I believe it will be the same with crypto currencies.

For equities it is usually first in first out. I would think it reasonable to apply the same rule here.

Note how the 100 is using funny characters. If someone is trying to defeat filters that way, they are scamming.
