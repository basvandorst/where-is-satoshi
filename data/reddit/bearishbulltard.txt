Oh fuck of your mother didn't type this.
@_date: 2019-07-26 08:33:25
Oh ffs bitcoin is not a bank and wouldn't be the biggest either.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:15:06
Exit the system and be a homeless fucker.
Christ. You know you can just hold some bitcoin without being a stupid clueless rebel, right?
You WILL be bailing out the banks, you WON'T exit 'the system', fiat will NOT disappear and the government will NOT fail because of some digitalized money you own.  
Also, you don't even WANT the government or fiat to fail, because you're used to your easy, industrialized life and won't survive two weeks in the chaos which will be created when either of these things happen.
Just hodl your .1 btc and stop being such a tiny rebel.

On a fuel tank which is designed to be emptied, dumped and totally destroyed in a few minutes?
This is not the Tron subreddit bro.

Dollar is also the currency of actually buying shit you need to stay alive and do shit, so yeah.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:59:24
No, but your government will be, with your tax money.
Joke's on you lol.
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:32:08
Hey, finally someone else who can't see an insane increase in the btc price without an economic catastrophe.
We should become friends.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:44:32
And if you're such a judgemental prick you're a judgemental prick.
Seriously. If you act like this, gtfo yourself. The btc space doesn't require everyone to hold a node, that's the beauty of it.  
You're just flexing with having a node. Well done. We all love you big time for 'investing a few hours or less. Much wow. Such amazed. No reason to act like a douche though.

I'm sure everyone will just go all in bitcoin because of this .25 percentage point rate cute.
Really, really sure.
33k by noon!

You could also have done some research before buying it, so you didn't have to cry afterwards.
@_date: 2019-09-02 09:59:14
Yeah this would make sense if we weren't able to divide a single bitcoin into a fuckton of little pieces, making it enough for fucking everyone.
This edgy bullcrap sounds really intellectual until you start thinking about it.
A single btc doesn't matter. 18 million times 100 million is a lot and leaves enough sats for eveyone.
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:21:47
Too bad for you this is not a matter of opinion, mining is either profitable or not, and since the mining hashrate for btc just has hit another all time high, it is quite obvious mining IS profitable.  
Your opinion is not only wrong, it also doesn't matter.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:59:21
I count six total bullshit statements in this post alone, which is above the threshold where I will provide a meaningful reaction.
You're just wrong. 'Keep thinking about it' yourself.
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:13:50
Kinda misleading title, since you're the one who messed up, and this has NOT anything to do with the Ledger devices.
That being said, sorry man. Taking a picture of the seed wasn't the brightest idea ever, but you didn't deserve this. Too bad.
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:20:24
Why 3 days.

If someone wants to try how it feels to tip 1 btc to a random stranger, I'll volunteer as the stranger.
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:45:36
Of course not.
Hal Finney has thought aslong these lines as well, stating that if btc will replace all current fiat, the btc marketcap wuld have to "range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million".
(Source: 
Of couirse nobody will own a single bitcoin, but also nobody will care. A single sat will be worth a few cents, making it a perfect currency.
So yeah, we're gonna slice that cheesecake into 7 billion pieces, but the cool thing is, the cake will grow enormously large.

Yeah now you know the name of the website it's still far better to rely on an answer by a totally unknown guy instead of confirm some data yourself before spending 10k.
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:19:58
If you want 1 million $ btc, you want mass adoption, and therefore you need some AML/KYC, so yeah.
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:56:41
And you didn't understand shit.
I'm not saying I don't believe in bitcoin or whatever, I just said the 'there are only 21 million of them'-aregument is useless because practically, if btc has replaced fiat, you can just use 21 million \* 100 million sats, which clearly is enough.
How you got this into a whining rant about fiat and inflation and 3rd world countries is beyond my understanding.
