This is a pretty substantial drop but I've made it through. One of my coworker last month when the market dropped like 20% said..."hey man I hope you pulled your bitcoin out. It looks like the market is collapsing." (I made clear I don't own any bitcoin at the moment but every altcoin in existence is all the same to them).
I turned to him and said, "Oh 20%...lemme see..." pulled out my phone, looked at my blockfolio, "oh look at that...I'm still up one-thousand percent since my initial investment. I think I'll be fine!"
I had to use that line again today twice...haha. 
Edit: Also, I am by no means a crypto guru by any means. I got lucky just like a lot of people here, as I've also made some bad calls as well. But I took the plunge because I love all the tech coming out of here and I love the money I'm making. Can't lie about that :) 
If it all comes crashing, oh well - I did well enough!
But I doubt it any time soon.

Oh my bad! This past week at work people have been asking me about it on the verge of annoyance so I hope no one does take this seriously. That's all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:18
Seriously...get this out of here
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:07:29
No one gives a fuck about you not giving a fuck!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:52:58
Wtf... seriously people freaking out because BTC dipped 6-8% in the past week...gtfo.
Seriously though if this scares you just go put your money in an IRA or ride the Index fund.
I think most people in here have balls of steels and I applaud you! 
But if you are thinking about selling and you're panicking  because of this small correction atm, I almost pitty you if alts take 20, 30, 50% correction. I've done my share of bagholding but patience is your best friend.
Everything I have diversified is now house money, so if everything comes crashing, oh well...it was a good run.
But I don't think it will. This space is still young and the various techs are here to stay, so if you can't stomach these big swings (small one right now ATM), for your own sanity and your health, I encourage to take your investment and go. When you do your taxes, just swoop up some savings bonds as these are as safe as you can get when investing.
-I got in last year when BTC was 800 and rode that to space. Thanks to that investment, it allowed me to diversify into other alts. I won big and loss big, but never did I ever put more than I care to lose ( I know, I know that's a trite statement)
Anyway, live long and prosper!

I don't feel bad for that guy at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:33
And thank you :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:02
I'm taking this as sarcasm, my friend. But nah, I've taken out all I've put in plus a good chunk more and I was the guy at the beginning of the year everybody was saying was a fool. Now those same people have been asking me"so how's your Bitcoin doing? Is it a good time to get in now?"
So the real fools are the ones that didn't want to take the chance when a few did (props to those who held through the bubble burst of 2014) and the hype train is in full force so now everybody wants in. Sure there might be another "bubble burst" but it'll come back stronger as it has done before.
And if this is the real end, then props to you for seeing it and calling it out.

I wonder how many normies will "Big Bang Theory" bring in after it airs?I mean, this could be a positive thing for BTC and altcions, no?

I remember buying my first btc in December 2016 at around $800. If I had any btc left I'd still be up +600%.
I understand past performance doesn't not equal future success and yadi yadi...
But I remember being on the sidelines in 2013 and seeing btc go from $100 to over 1k and then cut in half but the end of that year. It wasn't until this past year until btc saw 1k again and then the rest...well you know what happens. 
I'm not saying that we'll see near 20k anytime soon, but we can't ignore the value of what btc has brought to this world. 
It's going to take awhile for the world to catch up (maybe a year from now, or 5 or a decade or maybe 50 years) but once it does, the value this achievement will bring to humanity will will result in something we cannot fathom right now. 
But of course, this can all come crashing down, too, one day.  
But eh...YOLO as they say
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:55:04
Thanks and hope everything has been good with you as well!

It becomes one with the earth in the never ending cycle of human exploitation in which mankind will continue to fuel its greed that will eventually lead to the devastating destruction of mankind and all the world's inhabitants ...
And then we will reset and do it all over again...

I had a friend text me last night and was "so do you still have bitcoin? I heard it's crashing!" 
I said, yes and it's still worth 6x more than when Initially bought it.
I did let him know that I did take some profit and diversified into stocks like MSFT and tech etfs and I do now have two houses. 
Can't put all your eggs in one basket.
 "Cryptocurreny" isn't going anywhere and I'll always have something in it. Last year was crazy for those who caught the train, but right now it seems to be consolidating and hopefully stabilizing, but playing the long game now will certainly pay off in a few years.
Can't wait until we finally one day abandon stupid cash money. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:09:00
I was reading something about that where a guy put a down payment on one of those visa cards that you can load with bitcoin, but I don't think you can actually directly use bitcoin - unless I'm missing something. 
One day :)

It is anyone's guess right now. If the hard forks happens, you'll get 2 coins out of it if you're an investor. That's a good thing right? 
From everything I have been reading up on, whether it be a hard or a soft fork, the probability is high. 
As the saying goes, "expect the worst, prepare for the best." 
Either way, I think there is a silver lining either way it goes.

Well true story anyways as I do have 4 brothers and 3 sisters and twins on the way - 3 different fathers if I might add. 
And to be honest, a good deal of the insertion did not happen in the bedroom but in the back of her Cutlass Supreme.
