Seems not, I wrote to support

What if I don't own ETH? And you cannot buy coins from these wallets right? Need to send coins to an online exchange and them proceed?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:01:43
Honestly, with a little amount like 100$ and going for the long time run, I would consider going with alt coins instead. LTC seems pretty interesting, Ripple and IOTA also. They are cheap, have good plans and interesting technologies. And important to note that they are damn chepa and probably not at their all time high like the BTC.

I swear to god I looked everywhere when withdrawing from Quadriga, nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:13
Coinsquare is at 35 CAD

The sooner I buy the sooner I get to HODL right? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:18:21
Yeah but will BTC really hit another gain like during the last few years? Especially with all these competitors that offer lower fees and faster transactions and that could "detrone" BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:34:10
Well, you must know better...
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:31:33
Amazing answer! Thanks a lot, clears a lot of things out :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:39
This if indeed a good way to see things. I'll think about that
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:52:00
What is a "real" wallet and how could it be recovered if the app is not available anymore. Let's say Exodus is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:09
what is this "futures" thing?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:20:14
Well of course I read a lot about altcoins and their related projects. I don't really go for the underdogs but there ase some that are getting some good results. How "saffer" is BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:16:13
Thanks a lot for the info!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:15:08
Yeah but this anything I can afford could buy me about 100 full other coins instead of a fraction of 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:24:54
The thing I'm questioning here is more the short/medium term returns on investment in different currencies 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:07:05
Same thing happening with IOTA right now. It went crazy yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:35
Well it was well scored by critics and depicted a great culture and social cause of a lot of people. Well executed with a great soundtrack and relatable characters. And a fresh take on the "poor kids living in the ghetto" cliché. I mean, you might not have enjoyed it but it sure didn't "suck".
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:50:04
Exodus does the same I believe. No option to set the feed
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:11:57
Do you guys think the dip is already over? Was waiting for a lower dip to buy. Seems I missed my chance :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:13
This is exactly what I'm thinking. I already made some great profit with IOTA and made about 2$ with BTC due to the insane fees on some exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:39:29
Oh, and this is supposed to bring people in?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:28:55
Thank you for the explanation! Thing is I'm not concerned about the fee but would like to be able to deduce it before sending anything. Is there any way?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:49:23
I saw this option. If I understand correctly, I still get to use exchanges sites like coinbase but then send the coins to my wallet adress? And how do we backup these, not with another Ledger Nano S I suppose?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:38
I also have some faith in XRP, but like you said it might be long so I'm not counting on it for the next year.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:22:50
That's one way to see it, and are there fees for transferring coins out of your wallet to an exchange if you need to trade them for another currency?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:42
Do you know any wallet that can store both Bitcoins and Altcoins? Own a few of these.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:12
I currently own BTC, LTC, CRP and some Dogecoins. I would really prefer a all in one solution to store them together.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:16:57
IOTA is doing pretty well, LTC is cheaper and has some good predictions, XRP even though it currently doesn't do well also has a good plan.
