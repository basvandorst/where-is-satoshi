religion is very important, all religion teaches at it's core to do good to other's. to serve others. It is irrelevant if you believe in external gods heaven's and hells as they exist right here right now. most people live in a cyclical way of life solely serving the ego, wich will always lead to suffering. the purpose of religion is to end all sufering, this can be done by destroying the ego and escaping the cyclical wheel of suffering (bhavachakra). In christianity the ego are the 7 deadly sins. but unfortunatly this meaning get's twisted and there were holy wars and crusades, that's why i personally don't attend organised religion like churches/temples/mosques etc.
basicly serving yourself is hell and serving others is heaven, as one will always lead to suffering and the other not
look at society these days and you see great demons everywhere, (again it is irrelevant if you believe in litteral demons) people so greedy so selfish and perversed that litterally everyone suffers, can you name 1 person you know that does not suffer? we keep telling ourselfs that others don't suffer and that we will be happy once we have what that other person has. once we are buetifull or rich or have a wife. but in reality whatever we get or have we will continue to suffer until we destroy our ego's and serve others, to do good to others , to become selfless, to serve god!
there also is a real agenda to remove religion and replace it with materialism, as ego's are much more monetisable. If one has no religion and has greed, lust, envy etc etc he will buy the newest clothes, the newest cars, the newest watches, and will keep buying the newest stuff solely to impress others.
to better understand what i'm saying you can study bhavachakra

I never proclaimed myself as smart. there are posts that say bitcoin will reach 3k and there are post that say it will reach 100k all i'm saying is that it's just annoying spam. If you like the idea of bitcoin you should invest in it, I find that people that invest in bitcoin just for the money are useless investors.  I also think that bitcoin reached 20k because of these useless investors that are there only for the money and that caused the crash.

governments don't really control countries, the central banks do. yes bitcoin is good but that doesn't mean it is immune. in the past banks bought and stored gold as a mean of value and everyone who had money could change their cash for gold. btc and gold are simmilair there is a max ammount. in the past banks have controlled gold, what stops them at controling bitcoin?

thats good

find someone locally that is willing to exchange bitcoins. not 100% annonymous but only the seller wil know
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:54:23
no, I put money in bitcoin because I believe it's much better then the current (evil) central banking system. It's the only reason I have put money into it
@_date: 2018-08-20 09:39:42
in 2016 the european union made a law that when banks fail, they can take all your money above 100.000 litteral theft. everyone that has 100k + in europe should put their money in gold or bitcoin

bitcoin has problems with scaling, this made transaction cost extremely high ( (10/20€ per transaction) to solve this problem some people made this lightning network to help scale bitcoin (and so keep transaction cost low)
from my understanding  this works by combining transactions and sending them together in one package to lower strain on the blockchain. but this also has some flaws like you have to be connected at all times etc etc. ( i might be wrong on this, but just go to  and learn more there)

Well then let's make it big enough!

I know this might sound impossible, but charching no intrest is also possible, for example islamic banks are not allowed to charge intrest

how is it a conspiracy? im pretty sure those are facts and if banks are fine with destroying and killing countries, then they will definatly resist against bitcoin
but maybe not, i've spoken to some high ranking bangsters(?) and they actually want to change this sick system
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:38:49
we need more bitcoin investors like you
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:04:08
wow, that is really cool. How much customers actually paid with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:47:09
yes, but you can also wait a few weeks/days until the wallets with lightning network become fully usable ( it wil save you some transaction cost). there are some already that are usable, but they probaly have a few bugs etc

your close but not exactly, they cant really create all the money they want. It's called fractional reserve lending:
basicly banks can lend 10x what they actually have
so when i put 1 dollar in a bank, that bank can now lend at least 10x that (from thin air yes)
But the real problem comes when I take out a 100.000 dollar loan and buy a house with it, now the seller has a 100.000 dollars and he/she then puts it in his bank account, now the bank can lend 10000000! (out of nothing)
and so on and so on until trillions in debt
but besides all of that, everyone also has to pay  intrest on their debt, so everyone who takes out a loan with a central bank litteraly becomes a slave

until crypto banks open? what are you talking about? the whole point of crypto is decentralization.  you are your own bank
And of course governments are on our side, everyone is, it's in the best intrest of the 99.999% but as long as banks have them in their strangle holds nothing will change

bitcoin cash has a ceo! it is centralized. I was fooled by these assholes and lost some money from transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:10:00
Central banks ( like the federal reserve) are private entity's. It's not the government that prints money, it's a private bank. 
in your example you say we need cops to keep order, and yes i agree. But do we need cops to make up their own laws whenever they want? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:04:39
what's their strategy?
@_date: 2018-07-22 23:39:06
only way to fix it is to bring down the banks

I looked it up and yes the fed does not print money, but the problem with banks are that they centralize power to a very small ammount of people, these people then have extreme ammounts of power
for example you have spain, spain says for watever reason that they don't want a central bank (or watever the bank wants). the bank then can say: If you don't accept our bank then we will fund england (spain's enemy).
when money is decentralized, no one person can threathen whole country's
On June 4, 1963, an executive order was signed (by john f kennedy) with the authority to basically strip the federal reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest.
