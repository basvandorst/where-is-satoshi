Freakonomics was *extremely* clear that the abortion/crime "theory" didn't have much real data to back it up and mentioned several times that correlation does not equal causation. But critics tend to focus on that part of the book and nothing else.

Well foreign purchases are often flagged as suspicious by credit card companies.

It's not that the private key has been "shared", but rather that it has been exposed on a computer that could have viruses or keyloggers on it. So when you import a cold storage wallet you are now making your cold storage just as safe as a PC wallet.

More specifically, *individual* day traders almost always lose money. There are a billion articles about it, but here's a specific paper from Berkeley that explains it well (using a Taiwan market):
"in the typical six month period, more than eight out of ten 
day traders lose money."
The reason it's possible in a zero-sum game is because individual day traders only make up a small percentage of overall volume.

To those who don't think this is significant: even if that $10-15 million isn't *new* revenue (meaning they would have already purchased from Overstock with other currency), think about the 2-3% credit card transaction fees that Overstock is avoiding. That's an additional $100,000-150,000 **profit**. 
Shareholders certainly think it's a big deal: Overstock's stock price (OSTK) is up 10% today on the news.

Both arguments can be used against cash too. Why assume the risk of theft by carrying around cash on your person? What happens if you buy something with cash (or a debit card) and don't receive your product? Neither of these has stopped people from using cash.
And even if you don't agree with the decision, that's a valid trade-off that many people will accept. How do we know this? *Because they make that trade-off every single day with cash. *


There are [plenty of other ways to build up credit]( that don't involve a credit card. I bought a house and a car before I owned a credit card. 


Which made it 100% pointless. Why use something that only 0.0001% of the population uses? Mass adoption changes *everything*.


I was an early adopter of email because I work in IT, and I tried to get everyone I knew to use email. It didn't catch on at all with everyone I introduced to it, even though it was technologically superior. Like I've already explained, there was no real reason to use email: people talked on the phone back then, so why use something that's slower than that but faster than a physical letter? Email has no niche. 


I still haven't heard any evidence one way or the other. I admitted I was going off of anecdotal evidence from myself and 3 of my friends. What do others have to say?

Convenience isn't a "cost", it's a *service*. You're paying an additional price in order to receive that convenience. There's no source for this, it's just a business model for an entire genre of businesses. 
You can buy cans of soda at the grocery store for $2.50 for a 12-pack, which is 21 cents per can. So why would anyone ever pay $0.50 for a soda at a vending machine? *Because it's more convenient*. ATM's provide the same convenience.

Currently (in the US), if you want to buy gasoline with cash you have to physically walk into the store, pre-pay them say $20, and then the pump will only allow you to pump $20 worth of gasoline before shutting off. 
Bitcoin would be *perfect* here. Deposit 10 millibits to a pump's address, and then it allows you to dispense 10 millibits worth of gasoline. No need to go inside and wait in line. 
A lot of gas stations offer discounts for paying for gas with cash too, so presumably a similar discount could/would be given for paying with BTC.

It's still BIP0038 encrypted though. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:50:18
That means no. BIP0038 is a way of encrypting a private key with a passphrase. It works like this:
1. You use a passphrase to generate an encrypted private key at a 3rd-party website like [here](
2. You give the encrypted private key to the company who prints it (Bitcard-de does this)
3. When you go to withdraw the coins, you need both the encrypted private key (which you and the manufacturer know) and the passphrase (which the third-party website generated). That way you don't have to trust the manufacturer.

Money laundering is commonly defined as occurring in three steps: the first step involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means ("placement"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source ("layering"); and the final step entails acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds ("integration").
Any device that can convert money from one form to another (step two in the definition) without a paper trail of some sort could aid in money laundering. That's why AML laws exist.

I would like this to be different per model of widget: when I sell Widget Model A, I get 50% and Bob gets 50%. When I sell Widget Model B, I get 50% and Charlie gets 50%.
I could accomplish the above manually (receiving full payment and then manually send 50% to Bob), but I want it to be automated.

It's pretty simple: proof of purchase, and proof of sale.
Let's say you bought 10 BTC on Coinbase at $1000 each for $10,000 total. Today you sell all of it for $500 each. That's a total loss of $5,000. You would need to show proof that you bought it for $10,000 at Coinbase, and that you sold it for $5,000 (wherever you sold it).

Even if they aren't always small businesses, competition exists for several difference reasons. Target and Trader Joes are both more expensive competitors to Wal Mart, but Wal Mart is still cheaper and easier than either of them. Using your argument, it's completely illogical to shop at either of these places instead of Wal Mart. So why do they still exist? 
Using a technological example: back in the 90s email was pointless. Snail mail worked perfectly fine, and if you wanted to communicate immediately you could just call them. And businesses already had fax machines to send documents back-and-forth. So why would anyone spend several minutes dialing-up to the internet just to send an email? It's completely illogical, but nowadays email is ubiquitous. 
Alternatives exist because people don't just do the simplest, cheapest option 100% of the time. People vote with their dollars/time in a multitude of different ways and for different reasons. It's oversimplistic to assume that because something is slightly more difficult, people won't do it.

Pedantic distinction: theism is a degree of belief, gnosticism is a degree of *knowledge*. So the two aren't mutually exclusive.
* An agnostic atheist believes there is no god, but does not *know* that there is no god.

So in reality everyone is an agnostic, since nobody actually *knows* whether or not there is a god.

I never said it should be the majority of your portfolio, just a part. Ideally you should have a bigger portion of your portfolio in higher-risk stocks the younger you are, and slowly transition them to more stable ones as you get closer to retirement. 
Having said that, Bitcoin is more unstable than most high-risk stocks. But they can still be a part of many people's portfolios, even if that's only 5% of the overall value.

I don't know why this is such a difficult concept to grasp. The fees are added by the owner of the ATM in order to make a profit. Fees are determined by the market: as long as people are willing to pay $2 to withdraw money from an ATM, the price will remain at that level. Once people start deciding that the fee isn't worth the convenience, they'll stop using it, and then the fee will probably come down until it reaches equilibrium again.
Economics! 
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:53:33
Why would you ever need to prove ownership? You don't pay some yearly tax on diamonds, at least not in the United States. 
Aside from personal property taxes, the government doesn't care what you own until you sell it. THEN they want a proper valuation of it to determine how much you owe in taxes on the sale, or appreciation if it qualifies for capital gains/losses. 
Now, if it was stolen and you try to claim it as a loss on your insurance, that's another story. That happens all the time, and insurance agents are skilled at sniffing out what claims are fraudulent and which are legitimate.

Like I said, I don't gamble. And it's not free money, because there's obviously a chance of losing. And even though that chance is low, from a risk/reward standpoint I wouldn't risk 5000 mBTC to win 1 mBTC, whether those odds are on the life of Satoshi or on a dice game. The reverse is far more appealing: risking very little with the possibility of winning a lot, like buying a lottery ticket. At a 5000:1 payout I would prefer that side of the wager most of the time, though I still wouldn't do it because I don't gamble. 
I appreciate the good spirit of the offered wager, though.

My concern is that if politicians successfully tie Bitcoin to terrorism and either regulate it into the ground or outlaw it entirely. If the US government did either of those things it would set Bitcoin back quite a bit, and hinder mainstream adoption.

The idea is that by the time something is officially "news", it's probably too late to make money from that specific news.

This seems like a natural step in the evolution of Bitcoin. Of course early adopters had to use the traditional banking system to purchase Bitcoin (if they weren't miners). That's because the traditional banking system is ubiquitous.

You're not reading what I'm saying. I'm commenting on Bitsimple saying that the transaction numbers are off by several order of magnitudes, which is false because the chart is in thousands. 
The "212,000" vs "206,000" number doesn't matter with regards to what I'm saying. Whichever number the chart currently shows, it's in thousands, so BitSimple needs to add three zeros to the end to get the true number.

Compare that to the stock market, which peaked at 13540 in 2007 and dropped to as low as 8278 in 2009 **(a 39% drop)**. If you had all your money in real estate in that period, you outperformed someone with all their money in stocks by 300%. 
Look, I'm not defending the housing market. The housing crisis was terrible, with shitty lenders fucking everything up. But a relatively small number of people were *catastrophically* affected. For the vast number of people it was still "a good investment", the exact phrase said. 
And when you start ridiculing people on the internet instead of having a calm discussion you just look like an ass.

1. The overall sentiment of my post is that people *should* be worried about what governments can do. 
2. Governments *can't* outright stop Bitcoin. There's no centralized resource to take down, just like their efforts at stopping filesharing or drug usage.
3. However, they can still enact enough laws/regulations to grind Bitcoin to a halt and make it pointless to use.
Your aggressive attitude towards my post doesn't make any sense.

Fun little story: I used to have two accounts at Suntrust, a checking account and a savings account. I closed my checking account back in 2007 (switched to ING Direct) but left my savings account open. When I login to Suntrust's website, I just see my savings account. Perfect.
Two years later my savings account gets frozen. I find out that even though they "closed" my checking account, they still allowed charges/withdrawals to be made to it. So even though I had switched over most of my bill pays to my new ING account, there was one account (like Netflix or something) which I forgot about. Suntrust let them keep charging my account, which each time added a $35 overdraft charge. So two years of this meant that I had a balance of like negative $4000 in my checking account, which they never contacted me about. 
I tried fighting them over it for several weeks, but they refused to budge, and were keeping my savings account frozen too. I ended up getting my dad involved, who had been a Suntrust customer for decades. Once he was involved the branch manager quickly agreed that it was a mistake on their part and that they would drop the charges.
Banks are such great businesses.

13% sucks. 13% hurts. It turns what would have otherwise been a profitable investment into breaking even, and what would have been breaking even into a loss. But that's not "catastrophic" by any means. Maybe you shouldn't have used that word, since you don't know what it means.

For those behind paywall:
TOKYO—Japan's chief government spokesman and a member of the central bank's policy board said authorities were looking into the regulation of bitcoin, a day after Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox shut its website and halted trading.
Compared with regulators in many other advanced economies, Japanese regulators have been relatively silent on bitcoin. But Wednesday, after Mt. Gox's abrupt closure underscored the risks of a virtual currency, several of them started speaking.
Mt. Gox, the large bitcoin trading exchange, has all but disappeared. Marketwatch's Chuck Jaffe spoke to one regulator who's sounding an alarm on the virtual currency.
Wednesday morning, Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said the government was looking into the matter, collecting information through the Financial Services Agency, the Ministry of Finance and the police.
"The government will take measures if necessary once we have an assessment of the situation," he said.
Later Wednesday, Bank of Japan 8301.TO -1.35%  policy board member Koji Ishida also addressed the matter, saying, "I think the Japanese government will make a proper assessment" on the regulation of bitcoin.
Earlier in the week, an FSA spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that bitcoin exchanges "aren't subject to our regulatory oversight." In similar comments recently, the Bank of Japan said it "isn't in a position" to regulate bitcoin exchanges, while the Ministry of Finance said such supervision isn't its job.
Contacted again Wednesday, officials at the FSA, Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan all said they hadn't changed their stance on the issue.
A Tokyo Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said she didn't have enough information to comment.
Some investors with bitcoins tied up at Mt. Gox had sought guidance from authorities about protection for customers of the exchange but say they have received no clear answers.
Unlike a U.S. bank failure, in which deposits are insured by the government, there may be little recourse for people whose money is locked up in the closed exchange.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed Mt. Gox this month, asking it to preserve certain documents, among other things, according to a person familiar with the matter.
If Mt. Gox or its employees sent emails or financial transfers through Manhattan, federal prosecutors there could claim jurisdiction as they have in past financial cases. This month's federal subpoena was sent from the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, said the person familiar with the matter.
Attempts to reach Mt. Gox representatives in Tokyo were unsuccessful Wednesday.

Related to another question I asked today:
If I want to receive payments in Bitcoin, I need to have a program that creates a unique payment address, verifies when that address receives the required funds, and then notifies me. 
Right now the only way I know to accomplish this is by using payment processors like BitPay. 
Is there a way to do this myself? Like some sort of Bitcoin code I can build into a website to accomplish the same thing on my own, without using a third-party? The key is that I need to be able to uniquely identify payments: "John just bought 3 Widgets and paid 0.5 BTC successfully," as opposed to just having some wallet address that I watch.

And Bitcoin has additional features over credit cards. When I pay with Bitcoin I don't have to worry about my credit card data being compromised, nor even have a credit card account to begin with. The former is peace-of-mind for me, and the latter is crucial to anybody that is unable to get a credit card. And that's not even touching the fact that credit card companies report your data back to credit-score companies which can effect how easy it is for you to make major purchases like a house or a car. 
All of your criticisms can be used against cash too. I get paid via direct deposit straight into my bank account, so in order to use cash I have to visit a bank or ATM machine, both of which require time and one of which requires a fee. So why would anybody use cash? It's far more complex than just using a debit card, so in theory nobody in that boat should ever use cash, right?


Email was better from a *technological* standpoint, but nobody saw any real application at first. Email *did* require a middleman: it took forever to login to a service provider, and then you were paying per-minute to do something you could already do via snailmail or telephone. And email was "pointless" for the longest time because hardly anybody used it. I have no idea how old you were back in the early 90s when email was first catching on, but I assure you at the time most non-tech people believed it was just a high-tech fad. 
People keep comparing Bitcoin to email because it has a ton of similarities. Email was more cumbersome to use until it gained widespread adoption, and Bitcoin is the same way currently. Bitcoin won't truly shine until it gets mass adoption, just like any other major technology in history. 


Fair enough, this may be the case in the future. I disagree, and believe that cryptocurrency will become more ubiquitous in society, but neither of us can know for sure until it happens. The future is exciting!

That seems like the obvious future imo: banks will either release their own cryptocurrencies or set themselves up as Bitcoin middlemen.

I believe that the value of BTC will be $5000+ by the end of 2014, but I'm not maxing out my credit cards to buy BTC because *I might be wrong*. I already have a reasonable position in Bitcoins, but it's certainly a risky investment. At any moment Congress could put unreasonable restrictions on Bitcoins and regulate it into the ground. 
Belief in something doesn't mean completely ignoring all risks.

You are absolutely wrong because you're only focusing on one aspect. Stocks split for several reasons: partly to make it affordable for some, but moreso to create a better psychological reason to buy a lot of the stock, and to increase liquidity. 
The applicable parts:

Pretend that Bitcoins were something physical: like paintings. And MtGox is an exchange where people can auction off--or buy--art paintings. Then suddenly they stop letting people remove their paintings, and then closed up shop and ran with everything. 
At the very least it's theft. It's probably fraud: "a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain," which MtGox did by resuming trading and allowing deposits for the last week or so while they knew they were going bankrupt.

This is my assumption as well: their legal department warns that they may face huge liabilities, they quickly ban all apps to limit this as much as possible, and then when the legal framework is better known they'll start allowing them again.

I think most people *say* stuff like that, and then later when it ends up being a good move attribute it to mystical reasons ("I had a sign" or "I had a feeling, it must have been from God...").

The point is that over the long-term it will all even out, unless you're extremely unlucky. Yes, if you bought a home in 2007 you have incredibly bad luck. But trying to predict a market's ceiling or floor is extremely difficult to do unless you have inside knowledge. 
If you can successfully time the market you'd be a millionaire. But it's not that easy.

Look, I feel for you buddy. I don't know how much you lost, but it really sucks. I can't imagine losing a substantial amount of money that way. It makes me cringe.
But you shouldn't discourage others just because you chose to use a really amateurish exchange. The problem is very clearly with MtGox, not Bitcoin as a whole. All the other exchanges that have popped up recently are incredibly professional.

Well it depends how he obtained that money. I'm assuming MtGox had corporate status, meaning MK's personal finances are exempt from everything. So if his only personal income was his salary, then that money is fine. If he was skimming money off the top from MtGox then it's illegal.

From that point it's simple for a program to compare the deposit time to the deposit amount. $2.00 deposited at 5:00PM, parking valid until 7:00PM.

The mindset behind donations can be counter-intuitive at time.
The book *Freakonomics* has a really interesting example about blood donations. One time (not sure when, maybe several years ago?) blood banks started offering $25 to people who donate blood. This should make the number of donations go up, right? Wrong! They saw a huge decline in donations, like 50% less. Eventually they removed the $25, and the donations went back up to the normal level. It was theorized that people donate blood as a form of "charity", and by adding a payment it removed that charity incentive from people's brains.
Economics is crazy sometimes.

other innovations, is essentially positive, as it can contribute to meeting new payment 
needs and to making payments cheaper and more secure. those who choose to use a 
particular payment service can be expected to do so because it gives them an added 
value in relation to other payment services. this also applies to virtual currencies, 
which can for instance make some cross-border payments simpler, faster and cheaper. 
another advantage is if the payer does not need to share sensitive information, such 
as card number or bank account number, with the payee. Virtual currencies may also 
be better suited for small payments, so-called micro payments, on some websites.

Plenty of banks [deny people accounts]( if they're deemed high-risk, even though it can be done relatively risk-free from the bank's perspective. It's still time/effort/accounting on the bank's end, so they're still accepting a certain amount of risk by giving people an account.
Not saying I agree with it, obviously. Over time as BTC becomes more accepted it won't be considered risky.

I wish it had the ability to automatically split payments upon a deposit. This would be useful for selling digital goods and paying out royalties to people. 
Example: whenever 0.001 BTC is deposited into X address, I want to split that and send 0.0005 BTC to Y address and 0.0005 to Z address, all automatically. 
I know this can be programmed using bitcoind commands, but it's intimidating to a non-programmer (unless anyone has something like this pre-coded that I could use).

When I make a payment with Bitcoin, it shows the transaction instantaneously but it's "unconfirmed" for several minutes. I understand how this works. What I'm confused about: why does the confirmation time matter? I don't see how this could be taken advantage of. 
For example, if I buy something in-person with Bitcoin, the transaction appears instantaneously. Why would I need to wait for 3+ confirmations for it to be "official"? I've heard people say that the confirmation wait time is a roadblock that would keep Bitcoin from being used for fast in-person purchases, and I'm not sure I understand why.

The IRS news isn't a surprise to anyone. If you mine Bitcoin, it *should* be earned income. If you sell Bitcoin, you *should* have to pay capital gains on it (although it sucks if you're a miner and are subject to both). 
The only tough part is that all purchases you make with BTC are subject to capital gains tax. A simple solution is a FIFO type of wallet which will automatically buy the equivalent amount in Bitcoin right before making a purchase, so there *are* no capital gains. That's the only solution that makes sense, and I can't see the evolution of Bitcoin going any other way.

My story is a little similar. Got married in 2010, heard about Bitcoin in 2011. Was *very* close to buying a chunk, but was convinced the government would "ban" it and essentially render it useless. Wife and I saved up and bought a house instead. 
While the decision has worked out for us, I'm still kicking myself for not buying sooner. Oh well, I bought last August, and we've continued buying significantly from February to now.

A little bit, yeah.
Also: ouch at selling 9 BTC a week before the huge spike in November.

I don't think he was implying that you would need to buy supercomputers to mine that large of a percentage; I just think they were using that to show how much computing power is in the system.
Either way, your math verifies their main point: that it would be very expensive to do so. An easier way would be to create a new pool that gives like a 2% bonus to all mining, to incentivize people to mine at your pool, and gain 51+% that way.

Sure, Paypal is a business and I'm free to take my business elsewhere (which I'm trying to do via Bitcoin). But you're the one claiming that existing payment methods are "just fine", so I gave you my personal experience that they aren't.
But nice job trying to reframe the entire discussion.

I don't think they "can't stand Bitcoin," they're just a lot more risk-averse, and something like Bitcoin has a *much* higher risk profile than other investments.

There are absolutely some haters (like anything), but most people that criticize Bitcoin on there care more about its risk (which there is a tremendous amount of). 
Similarly, they're extremely critical of people from Wallstreetbets who try crazy put/call options in an attempt to get rich quick.

I remember when email came out. I thought it was completely pointless. Why would someone buy a $5,000 computer and pay for internet just to send a digital letter to someone? Physical letters cost pennies to send in the US Post. And if you need to talk to someone sooner, you can pick up the phone and call them. Emailed seemed like a solution to a problem that didn't exist. 
Boy was I wrong.

The last 6 years are pretty much the most stable time in the history of gold. Zoom out and look at it from the last 50 years:
* Increased from $235 in 1970 to $918 in 1974 (280% increase)
* Decreased from $918 in 1974 to $489 in 1976 (48% decrease)
* Increased from $489 in 1976 to $2,232 in 1980 (500% increase)
* Decreased from $2,232 in 1980 to $831 in 1982 (60% decrease)
* Increased from $831 in 1982 to $1,279 in 1983 (50% increase)
* Decreased from $1,279 in 1983 to $720 in 1985 (45% decrease)
* Increased from $720 in 1985 to $1,080 in 1987 (50% increase)
* Decreased from $1,080 in 1987 to $377 in 2001 (70% decrease)
* Increased from $377 in 2001 to $2,062 in 2011 (550% increase)
* Decreased from $2,062 in 2011 to $1,100 in 2015 (45% decrease)
Historically, gold is wildly volatile.
