I think you’re right. OP is worried that a malicious actor could “stumble upon” his 24 seed word by trying multiple permutations from the BIP39 word list. 
OP, while this would in theory be possible it’s not going to happen in your lifetime. The sheer number of permutations is staggeringly enormous.

I have multiple Trezors for this reason and when upgrading firmware. 
Also, consider putting your seed on something more durable than paper. I use titanium plates from ColdTi. A house fire would destroy your trezor and the paper backup.

The short answer is even if you had the computing power of all bitcoin miners it would still require several trillion years to generate a 24 word seed collision. 
Rest easy. It’s essentially impossible.

No... it was sold FOR bitcoin from the dealer perspective.

LIFO works good if you've been a hodler and did some fair amount of trading during the rise last year.  
Keep in mind though that LIFO may likely hit you with short term gains rates.
Also, there's no clear cut guidance from IRS that LIFO is allowed.
Once you select a method you have to stick with it (so I am told) so keep in mind that if you go LIFO you'll be stuck at short term rates up until you cash out significant portion of your position.

long term on the first coin if you choose FIFO (first in first out) accounting method.
 If you wait another year from the date you bought the second coin to cash it out you still only pay long term gains.  
But, if you cash out the second coin in less than one year from its purchase date you pay short term gains.

Precisely.  FDIC does not cover coins. Coins are not insured against customer stupidity and poor security. What I'm saying may not be popular, but it's true. 
Have your coins hacked because you did not have 2FA or were spoofed or man in the middled and kiss your coins goodbye.  Coinbase's insurance will not cover that.  They will only cover coin losses if it is Coinbase's fault.

You’re a few months in, friend. You’ve got a year or two long wait ahead of you. Best advice is forget you have any crypto. Set up recurring weekly or monthly buys in small amounts. Then, wait.

Up to $3k in loss (for single filers) can be taken each year. This is over and above any gains. So, if you had a $10k loss last year that was unapplied to that years return and you had $5k in gains this year. You could apply $5k to zero the gain, plus another $3k. This totals $8k which leaves $2k unclaimed which carries forward to the next year.

Why are you bringing in a new argument? In your original post you said ‘according to this’ meaning according the the lines in this chart people would be eating dust until 2022. 
I was arguing that you had incorrectly read the chart (which you did). I explained that ‘according to this’ chart a new ATH happens in ‘19. 
Now you’re talking about time spans between ATH which is entirely irrelevant to your OP or the lines on this chart. 
Now, can you defend your ‘eating dust until 2022’ argument as it pertains to this chart?

They have a patent on ASIC Boost so it may be difficult to compete with them.  ASIC Boost provides no advantage for BTC though (thanks to segwit) so they’re competitive advantage is only with ASIC Boost compatible coins (BCH of course).

I print to paper from address generated offline.  Then I take a digital photo of each paper wallet with a cheap 8mp digital camera which I never remove the SD card.   The paper wallets are in a floor safe. Camera with SD card is kept somewhere else securely. 
Should something happen to the paper wallets I still have them as photos on the SD card. 
Perhaps an unorthodox arrangement but works for me.

Nice.  This is great.  But I've noticed that the paper wallet portion of the site no longer exists at 'account settings&gt;integrations'.  Yet I can still go there directly by this address:

A clue (and the only clue I will offer):  You'll decode information derived from the image with a brainwallet script to get the private key.  Although I'm sure most of you knew that already. :)
I'm not going to give any other clues.  I'm doing this to see if a scheme I want to use to not loose private keys to my BTC is viable and secure enough for my purposes.
I'll keep the address loaded with the 0.25 BTC for a few months or until someone solves the puzzle. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:39:56
right...  My thought was one single transaction of 20BTC to one address to be hodl'd for time and eternity.
But, then I started to wonder.  Is it harder to compromise multiple addresses than just one?  If so then I should spread the 20BTC across many addresses.

KYC/AML only required at one exchange.  Transfer of stable coins among exchanges do not trigger KYC/AML requirements. 
Say you want to play on an arb opportunity...  you have BTC on Coinbase that is trading lower against USD than another exchange. Transfer your BTC from CB to exchange ‘B’. Trade out of BTC into stable coin on Exchange B then transfer stable coin to CB. Buy BTC with stable coin on CB. 
Exchange B required no KYC/AML verification because there was no gov’t sanctioned fiat moved.

Being a follower of current events I knew what he was referencing, but clearly he did not.  I started laughing so hard, turned around and walked away. 
Later that day he came to me... I assume he made the same comment to someone who then educated him cause he said, 'you're a dick!'.  Again, I laughed, turned around and walked away.

There appeared to be considerable support at 3k. I set my sell order to 3001 but it did drop slightly below to 2970. 
I cant say I knew positively it would bottom at 3k.  It may well have dropped to 2800. I took an educated gut feeling guess and it worked. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:17:29
Cowardly? Depends on motive.
I sold at 4425 and just rebought back at 3800.  Selling off is not cowardly if you understand the market and have good chance at buying more coins back for the same dollars. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:47:38
This. Sold off some at 4425 last week.  Put a 3000 limit buy and waited.  Last night during blissful sleep the 3000 executed. 47% gain.  
I was not positive it would go down to $3k, but it really didn't matter since my cost basis is well below 4425 and taking profit was a reasonable move. 
it's always good to put what seems like a ridiculously low limit buy after selling.  You just never know if it might trigger.

This.  If you have a $10k daily withdrawal limit (which I think is the default limit for established accounts) it can cause some activity into a bank account that can be mistakenly seen as structuring.
It's important to wait more than 24 hours between withdrawals to make sure the transactions are able to be over $10k so as not to be seen as potential structuring by the bank.
It's ridiculous but true.

What about any coins you were holding before the purchase?  Those get used up with the purchase in FIFO accounting.

You do realize futures contracts can be sold at any time, right?  They don’t all just end on the close date. Futures expirations have little effect on BTC price. 
But let’s assume all the contracts were held until expiration. Just look at the futures volume. There’s not enough there to have any real effect on price.

But if you go back to Bitcoin at beginning of 2011 and run a line (yellow) on the log chart you get somewhere near $100,000.
Granted... $100,000 is still pretty spectacular, but not enough to keep McAfee from feasting on his own sausage!

Were not saying the same thing. 
You’re saying they manipulate the market to affect price so they dont lose on a futures contract they bought some time ago. 
I’m saying they could give a fuck about futures contracts because they stand to make far more staying strictly in the market itself with leveraged trades and manipulation. 
Futures expiry has very little affect on underlying price.

At that point you are relying solely on the single passphrase.
For a brute force attack you can get an idea on how long it would take by trying some passwords here:
But that's just for brute force.  If your passphrase is weak for other reasons like it contains easily derived information about you (birthdates, wife's name, etc) or word string from a book or song, etc all bets are off.

I've seen this often with sales of 80% AR-15 lowers.  Manufacturers/Sellers/Buyers prefer the no papertrail of cash with those items.  Unmarked, unserialed, 80% complete firearms are perfectly legal to sell without FFL transfer.  The appeal being since no ATF serial is needed there should also never be a papertrail.
I foresee 80% firearms sales benefiting greatly for BTC!  And LEGAL as well!

You will be waiting a VERY long time if you are wanting to buy BTC at £3.00!
You're thinking of how this works is incorrect. You don't set the limit at the amount you wish to spend/recieve but rather the price of bitcoin at which you want the order to settle.
In your case you want to set the limit sell price at £3,000 (I hope you are very patient... this will not happen anytime soon).
For a limit buy or sell you want to set the BTC price to a price slightly below or above (respectively) the market price. Best if the price you set is at least the current market price minus/plus the current spread.  If you dabble in limit orders within the spread you risk paying a fee on the order due to the market price fluctuating and crossing your limit price before you hit the place order button.  
I learned this the hard way during some volatile trading times when the spread was more than $15 and my limit buy order was within $10 of market price. By the time I placed the order (literally, seconds) the market price was below my limit order which triggered it as a market order with fees.
As for your invalid entry error... likely due to your order being for such a small amount of BTC.  GDAX is down at the moment so I can't test to verify that yet.
