One day you'll learn that being respectful and kind is even more important than being right.

You do realize they are a business? I see people complain about the fees non-stop. Every business has fees. They exist to make a profit.
If you think their cs is weak now, imagine how terrible it would be w/less or no fees.

This post isn't unique or funny. Stop upvoting this crap. There are 10 of these a day.

How is using the term white, male patriarchy racist? Do you know what it means?
Describing things or people as white or black is not racist. Pretending racism doesn't exist and that the US isn't a white male dominated culture isn't going to solve anything.

I can see that explaining this to you isn't going to do much good. Troll on young one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:33:51
Is this kind of post really the best that this sub has to offer?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:59:10
Hell yes. I won't ever have enough BTC to realize that goal but I can't fault anyone who does this. Land/property is one of the most stable investments out there. Obviously, it can still take a hit in a recession but as the economy recovers, property will always have value. Same cannot be said of crypto YET.
Best of luck to ya.

This post would be more interesting if you said why. Without your reason, it's just a number!
2/10 would not read again ;)

You really have no clue what I'm getting at in my original comment. A note for you, if you have to resort to personal insults you don't have a good argument. It's silly.
Also, I went to 25 countries this year. And I'm not in the US now. So your attempt at insinuating that I'm an illegitimate shut-in is absurd. Cheers,

You're super insecure. Just did a quick scan of your comments and SO many of them are you calling people names. Like a grade school bully. Calling people "idiots, dumb, retards, etc..."
You yourself have terrible spelling and grammar. It's like...I would love to see you in your situation right now. Very curious what you're like. If you have anyone who cares about you and if they know you talk to strangers on the internet like this.
The world is an interesting place.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:05:38
Don't be an ass. Why does someone have to "care about Bitcoin" in order to buy it? You are not a better person in any way because you bought sonner, know or care about crypto than anyone else who purchased. 
I can't stand this type of bogus exclusivity. Please stop.

Coinbase is completely down for me. All coins are unavailable. New to crypto and super unimpressed with coinbase. I'm baffled as to how they are the market leader in the US. 
They have zero customer support or service. They have the highest fees and their site goes down frequently. As a company, they are making an absolute killing in this bull market. Why can't they get their sh*t together? Not enough other legitimate competition?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:16:46
Well, I've read what bitfinex'ed has tweeted. I've read your thoughts. I agree something is fishy and wouldn't be surprised if bitfinex is shady. That said, I don't think either of you (unless you're the same person) has proved that bitfinex will collapse or if they do, the market for BTC will take a hit down below 4k. Especially not after this weekend.
Appreciate the tip though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:59:35
What slight? I am new! There is a lot I don't understand. Happy to admit that.
I'm not here to argue about BTC v BCH. I'm talking about the content and tone of this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:14:56


Bitfinex is a US co? The US gov cannot just seize domains in other countries.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:26:01
As a new person to crypto, it would be great to lose all the spam "hodl" comments under every post.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:30:01


If the global economy is collapsing and it's down to simply bartering for survival, that gold won't be worth much at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:01:35
They did a decent job of explaining it without getting too bogged down in the details. Worth a listen for newbies like myself.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:51:01
I agree. It's disappointing. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:32:11
Shut up about this app. The story is bogus, it makes two wallets. You can send BTC to it! I'm new to crypto and I only have a bit of BTC and no BCH. So I've been coming here mostly to TRY and learn more about it.
That said, the immaturity and petty squabbling here at r/bitcoin is embarrassing. If you don't like BCH, don't use it. Stop with the constant conspiracy theories and Chicken Littling. Please. 
It just makes me want to quit coming to this sub when all I see is petty bs and hodl memes. Thanks friends. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:34:48


Haha, what? This account is new and you're frantically posting about this topic and only this topic in multiple threads. 
I'm not arguing whether you are right or wrong but you certainly have an agenda.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:55:17
I have read all about it. What I don't appreciate is the WAY in which it is being handled and discussed. If you read my comment, I make this clear.
Tone and method is important IMO. You don't have to agree, this is my opinion.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:48
This has nothing to do with big banks and everything to do with built in fraud protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:47:16


That is a massive misrepresentation of my comment. Read the entire discussion for more context. Thanks friend!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:44:59


Yes, that was my point. I find it hilarious that your first response was to argue with me about how new I am to BTC.   
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:41:30
You've made this comment multiple times in the same thread. That is suspicious IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:58:40
You're confusing pre-fiat with an global economic collapse or disaster scenario. I've been in disaster zones. A spot of gold means nothing to people desperate for survival. 
I'm certainly not saying it would have no value if society were to re-stabilize. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:01:31
Don't you pay a fee to wire transfer? What's the diff between the wire fee and coinbase's 1.5% fees?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:14:08


Sorry, haha. You're starting off your reply by telling me how new I am? That says a lot about the attitude here. 
I did not say we shouldn't discuss BCH or the concerns we might have w/it. I'm specifically addressing the dogpiling and sniping that constantly goes on here. A lot of the comments under this post are flat out bogus.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:02:13
You're right. They aren't really spam are they? I meant to use spam in the context of an unwanted comment that is essentially worthless to the conversation.
But there may be a better way to phrase it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:31:51
You can use bitstamp to buy w/a cc.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:14:09
Sure, I understand it's faster. Was asking about the difference in fees. Is it more or less expensive to wire?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:29:09
Where was LTC when you bought in though?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:40:21


Lots of comments, yet no one has actually done this.
