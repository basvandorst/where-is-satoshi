There is a section on the tax return (US) that is specifically for the management/fees associated with asset management. This is included in your “itemized deduction” bucket. If your total itemized deductions do not exceed the standard deduction of $12200 (single) or $24400 (married filling joint) then they will not count as a deduction. 
Most people do not exceed the $12200 standard deduction. I hope that made sense!

You lost me at black on black.

I know. I am not a fan of black on black cars. That car looks way better in more vibrant colors.

I am a tax professional and have directly asked an IRS Agent for an answer to this question. First, I asked him “Why does the question regarding crypto assets ask if you PURCHASED or SOLD any crypto assets. Shouldn’t you only be required to report sales of crypto assets?”
He agreed that all purchases should not be reported. He was unsure of why the question was worded that way because you wouldn’t report the purchase of gold/stocks/bonds. He also said that the purpose of the question was to tax capital gains/losses on crypto assets. So unless you sold, you should not report a crypto asset purchase.
Hope that helps!

I understand your logic but that is not the way the IRS will look at it. Using Bitcoin on Robinhood can create capital gains/losses which the IRS wants to tax.

I am a tax accountant and I recently asked an IRS agent about this. He said he was unsure of why it was worded that way “PURCHASE or SELL crypto assets.” He continued and said that you should only report crypto assets that you have sold during the year.

If anyone would like to actually do this, you should just put the fair market value of the donation on the date that you donated Bitcoin. 
Also, if you don’t exceed the standard deduction of $12200 (single) and $24400 (married filling joint) then you don’t have to claim that deduction on your return.

Robinhood/Coinbase is a custodian for crypto assets so the IRS would still view it as your cryptocurrency. A great example of this would be TD Ameritrade. Most people don’t own physical stocks/bonds but you are the owner of the account for which the stocks and bonds are held. TD Ameritrade is just the custodian for those stocks and bonds. This is the same argument the IRS would make with regard to crypto assets.
