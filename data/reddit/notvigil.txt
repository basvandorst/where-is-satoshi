This was exceedingly helpful thank you. Looks like i've got about 14 rows on that tab. I've decided to just hang loose in the mean time anyway, but it's great to know why now.

inputs regarding fees? That's not a term i'm familiar with. Can you expound a bit?

For now I just plan to wait to wait for a reduction to the unconfirmed transactions and then I'll try to consolidate. Could be waiting a real long time unfortunately haha.

thanks for the reply. 3944 bytes. My understanding, is that that's way bigger than the average transaction.

this is the kind of shit I do like. thanks for all the good information. been messing with alt coins for a minute, but I've had very little experience moving the big BTC so far.

whoa those are actually really hard core fees. I'm no expert, but the general idea is that you send from one wallet to another using the smallest allowable fee possible. The 160,000 unconfirmed transactions we have now make it basically impossible to consolidate for any reasonable fee, because if you try and short change the system your transaction wont go through. With the way things are now, you're just going to be better off holding on to what you have and waiting for the congestion to clear up. Unless someone else knows something I don't, but that's kind of why I made this thread in the first place.

bitcoin dust is basically just small amounts of bitcoin all in one wallet. Your wallet will show you the total amount of bitcoin that you have, but if you get mining payouts like me, or receive/make several small transactions, then that total amount of bitcoin is made up of smaller bits of coin. also known as bitcoin dust. Basically having a bunch of dust in your wallet results in very large byte sized transactions which result in a in exceptionally high fees. So it's best to consolidate your bitcoin dust before you move it. This can be achieved by sending your dust to another wallet that you own turning your dust into a single input. For example right now if I try to spend my entire btc wallet it's made up of 14 or 15 different inputs, my fees are through the roof making any transaction not even worth making talking an upwards of 100 bucks for the fees alone cause the transaction is so big (in bytes). if I were to consolidate i'd be looking at fees more in line with the average of like 8 or 10 bucks.
