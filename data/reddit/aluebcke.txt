In addition, their swap prices are only to their advantage. Gripped a 50$ Airdrop once and never used it again ��

Gold money is not dead due to lacking decentralisation.. it is dead because one really doesn't know how much can be found in earth's crust, so it's lacking an ultimate proof of scarcity! In addition, I would rate the production costs of an amount equal to one BTC much higher. So in final consequence a gold currency comes with the inherent risk of a possible inflationary backup. Or take, for example, a scenario where a huge amount of gold would be found on the territory of North Korea - this would give such a nation sudden political power as long as there aren't sufficient reserves elsewhere (which would then be explored and increase the total supply). 
Funny that the situation is similar with BTC right now, with largest portions of hashrate to be found on the terrain of the nations of Russia and China. Under this light Bitmain's decision to build a massive mining farm in Texas can be regarded as act of equalisation and evading political pressure from just one player.

Which is quite ironic given that it's easier to gather information than on yesterdays. Mankind has a powerful tool called internet, but they mainly use it for porn, spreading hate or celebrating oneself's idiocy on free will. At the end of the day we remain apes.

Annotation: The last two-three years the public saying in most German media has been 'it's just a currency used by criminals, keep your hands off'. From January on, banks here are allowed to sell them to customers or doing wallet and escrow services (!?). This allowance came fast (in relation to the usual terms that German bureaucracy takes) and Deutsche Bank is known for its strong lobby. So why does this not affect prices right now? The answer is simple, do you think they are willing to pay a honest market price? No, they rather lend to short the market and burn money to get their fingers in as long as their acquisitions bring in profits in the end. Damn all the fiat billionaires must sweat so hard while watching their fiat empire flushing down the toilet slowly! What DB now doing is basically the same thing they did between the dotcom-crash and Lehman-Desaster, they set the pace for competitors in order of an upcoming (retail-) rallye. The goal is no less than the escape into mass adoption as middleman, otherwise there won't be any business in future. Think about: A possible benefit of CBDCs is the instrument of direct distributions to private households to directly stimulate demand on microeconomical area without any middlemen - people could consume and this can affect the economy far greater than to send this to bank account. Because in the last ten years we could watch banks getting easy money while the least people on the streets had a benefit from these measures at all. And this is also a cause for the rise of extremistic political movements in affected economies. DB has accepted this it seems and tries to get into a new business. As we learned: You're either the first, the smartest or just criminal; they no longer can afford the latter option ��

Guess.. FED calls it "no QE" since the incident on Repo-market at the end of September, but admitted they're not going to stop printing Dollars. So a cash-settled service to burn money while shorting the market seems to be no big deal anymore. All you need are a few people acting as agents and boatloads of freshly printed money. Doing this directly would be like waving a white flag.

At first, you're a nice debate partner with some skills in leading one - appreciated since there's the opportunity to get somewhat out. But you're rushing a bit too much to your position for my taste.
I really put up a long answer (beside work, kids and personal nightmares ��) and then got this sent by a buddy and can greatly short this answer : 
We see
- there aren't enough coins to mine already, because market prices obviously dominate over production costs
- but there are also not enough coins in movement that could justify a leading role to set market price
- if a miner wants to keep up it's down to burning money right now. But maybe it's just down to miners driving each other out of business. Whereas the first point grips, this would only be a rallye for the last mineable coins and these would only be sufficient as driving force when controlled by a single party.
- why should miners short through Futures to increase their losses? Nobody's interested in extending losses, unless you're a corporation betting on having tax-evasive effects. My experience is that even the lowest fees in my Transactions have been accepted since spring, which indicates a high competition amongst miners. High competition and shorting prices just doesn't match.
- and no, just talking about a lacking demand is too easy. Maybe on retail levels, but people usually buy like 0.1 BTC (but more frequent). Retail amounts not enough to influence prices that much.
- so in sum you have market participants willing to burn money. Of course it's speculation from my side, but such phenomena could and can also be observed on the gold market, where huge short-sellings led to price drops. Or this year; the least people know about bigger gold acquisitions made by some east-European countries (we speak about 10-ton-buys in median) without significant rises in pricing.

Your user experience is how long yet?
And no I'm no veteran, merely a much-reading greenhorn. Bitcoin is what people make out of it, and actually it does not seem to be regarded as a day-by-day currency. Rather than a standart on which people reference the value of other currencies they will use, may it be all fast-flowing coins like Lumens or SUGAR or whatever that can be transferred within seconds.
That's why people regard it as somewhat "golden" and this is legit: Gold is a traditional hedge, coming from ages where people needed sheer manpower to mine it, so it has been regarded as somewhat of value. But the truth is, nobody can estimate how much gold is hiding in ground (hint: China gathered 20.000 tons already for their gold-backed Luan and many countries increased their reserves in 2019, but it apparently does not reflect on gold price - an indicator it's not as scarce as the gold mining industry is trying to persuade). 
Also, the last 11 years can tell us that there might be a paradigm shift in human society, accepting the scarcity of a good that's completely digital. But the advantages (i. e. no need for safe physical transport as long as you got the seed in mind) seem to outperform apparent disadvantages. So it's really down to "soft" factors like recognition, acceptance and perception; at least the Bitcoin has been a huge success yet. For everyday business not, but that's rather a question of time when producers start to exchange groceries or production ressources for Cryptos. My bet is the next big recession will change a lot as producers of raw materials won't see any sustainable benefits from just accepting fiat which central banks everywhere are printing without any limit. 
I'm quite surprised that nobody of you has become aware of the sneaking inflation you can witness especially with food over the last decade: processed products keep the price or it increases while its ingredients are getting poorer on and on, while raw groceries have either increased in prices or you get miserable quality for the prices one had been used to earlier. So why should a farmer not start accepting assets with a known scarcity than to accept fiat in (unfair) negotiations with trade giants? Accepting the latter will definitely bring him into deeper troubles. Inflation has it that basic supplements like water for example (we know drinking water is a scarce Ressource in earth) also explode in price. And this moment is yet to come. Maybe with delay but it will come.

As example, do the following search: bitcoin Canada study. It's all about awareness, the story and perception - BTC made it to be recognised as store of value throughout all age groups. Can tell the same from my place: the least hold any or ever made a transaction but everyone has heard of it. This is very comparable to gold in terms of recognition, whereas most people own a bit through jewelry - BTC is already more scarce.
The families prolly didn't talk about Bitcoins or Cryptos in first line, but surely about what's going and how to get this passed with less damage. It's just obvious that younger generations bring in Cryptos as alternative like so many studies verified.

You are doing a mistake. It's all down to drawing trends that the past has shown us, that's why prediction is not knowing but calculating chances. This also counts for weather forecasts, which are only more accurate on macro level, but regularly fail on predictions for a given, limited local area (e. g. there is a thunderstorm prediction for your town but it misses your town due to immediate wind turn - because the projection didn't weigh in wind turns that much).
Since the BTC wealth is relatively concentrated (and the people surely know each other) it would be more promising to do investigations here, because the data you aggregate are always mirroring their deeds, and they own more than enough assets to move the markets where they want them to be.
So, I'd rather join a whale for a long good coffee than to look in the technical glassball analysis..

Nooo, this is how institutions want your coins cheap now to sell them to you later for 100.000 each ��
@_date: 2019-12-12 10:43:40
It's just not enough to dictate the price? I think it was last week where one could read that 11.5 mio. BTC haven't been moved since 2018 (Gray-scale included). Then count in several dust estimations. 3 mio. yet to mine.
In short, we permanently experience a certain level of volatility although there generally aren't enough coins in flow that would justify it.
If I were a bankster and knew my central bank is up to print me everything (which means my stuff is going to decrease in value going to zero for everyone outside national borders) I would try to buy hashpower as long as possible on one side while trying to put pressure on the price to get even more before it's too late. Because I don't need to care about burning my stuff.
So my opinion: Most mining clients in China are of an institutional background. And the efforts in price dumping have the sole target to get the people selling.
Some like the idea that Grayscale people would do this. But think about twice now that the FED is doing their "no QE"-QE, that would be like trading gold nuggets for flies and everything but sustainable. Would you give a BTC for five million flies when you can expect that 5 trillion more flies are on their way?
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:01:00
Your assumptions are accurate because they follow the implication that supply and demand dictate the price. BUT the last days there was a big hashrate drop and it had no effect to the price. Wouldn't a drop give the outlook of a coming supply shortage? And with increasing hashrate there comes increased complexity, which means as institutional miner you have to get out less over time unless you upgrade your hashpower - which means higher break-even costs no?
I love the soft factors to ask about demand. Burger King started to accept BTC for deliveries here in September I think. In Germany, where BTC is a completely neglectable payment option. Take an American corporation and add the German austerity fetish for the management - from the single point as payment option the costs for offering this don't make any sense, especially in a Country where Cryptos have no impact to day-by-day life. No, they offer this because they want them as cheap as possible and the outlook of getting any by this way seems to justify the costs. But this is anything but no demand.
