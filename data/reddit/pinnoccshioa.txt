I wonder how much his floor is now worth?

Is it bad that I throw pennies out?

Gotta throw in the caveats.  I cannot believe people were taking out second mortgages to buy BTC in 2017.

Hypothetically speaking, yes.

Great point.  Where is the greener grass?!

When can I invest in the KanyeCoin?

Ripple is counterintuitive to the crypto movement.  Banker backed.

At this point I believe the space is too big to fail.  Digital currencies will come and go, but the decentralized concept is here to stay.  Finding a way to regulate and tax this ever-evolving space is the new objective for government(s).  I argue that crypto is already seen as a viable investment and certainly more exciting than a boring portfolio of equities/fixed income.

The fact that these currencies are utilized as payment on the dark web means there is no stopping it.  The sad reality is that sex trafficking, drug dealing, and all other illegal activities are omnipresent in human society.  We might as well accept it and find light in the darkness of its utilization.  The more traction this digital currency space gets, the more positive its impact will be as it is put to better use - transcending government control and creating a free market with global recognition.  In this day in age, global recognition and valuation is a very rare concept.
