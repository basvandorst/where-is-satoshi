On Bitcointalk.org, people use "flair" of sorts when creating a thread for a new coin. 
ANN = Announcement - Typically used when a coin actually launches
Pre-ANN = Pre Announcement - Used to drum up interest in a coin before it's launch to help ensure it's success
QQQ = Question Thread - Used for fielding questions regarding the coin in order to keep the main ANN thread from being spammed up

Saved this...interested to see if you are close to being correct
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:45:37
Ba Ba Ba BULLSHIT!
If it *is* real though, I hope you are able to recover them!

Well, you will have to get them sent to ANACS.  I'm not familiar with their grading process or charges unfortunately.  PCGS and NGC won't grade them.  
You should be able to find a local coin shop and have them sent off for a nominal fee, probably something like 25-35 USD.

I mean it's obviously a scam attempt, but damn...
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:41:28
Don't feel too bad...I offloaded all of my LTC @ 4.28 or so in Nov. 2013, just before they shot up 10x that.  
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:05:50
I believe [this]( may be the article referred to
It *is* about a 51% attack from ghash, lol

That's awesome!  I started "accepting" BTC at the headshop I work at, also in Texas :)

No, lol...I'm already eying a couple more.  Probably gonna pick up his 25 LTC Lealana as well
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:27:54
That's my point...no CEO's from the banks are going to get prosecuted.  Even when they pay their "fines" they don't have to admit any wrongdoing...
Complete Bullshit

I feel like this was a shout out to the heyday of DDOSing Gox and watching the price plummet.  I agree it was most likely someone or a group of someones trying to lower the market to buy coins cheap.

[It happens](

Found on eBay, bought directly from guy.  Paid $600

Do your family/friends still have them?
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:35:38
I used Coins E when they first came out.  They were a decent exchange and offered markets not available on other exchanges.  I sold a decent amount of various coins using their platform and had been mostly happy with it.
That all changed completely on September 4th, 2013.  I made a purchase for 10,000 Phoenixcoins and then attempted to withdraw them.  They showed the transaction as completed with some confirmation hash that didn't pertain to anything on the blockchain and no coins in my wallet.  In these past several months, I have repeatedly contacted them via their support system, only to receive a response of "We are working on it".  You can imagine how infuriating it is to be blown off while they constantly add new coins and features.  I have reached out to the on Twitter as well, but still no response.
Coins-E is a garbage exchange and will not give two shits if you can't access your coins.  DO NOT USE COINS-E!

Thanks for this...They just posted in today.  I called them out and replied using your text.

Aside from the fact this has little to do with Bitcoin, what do the US authorities have to do with Scottish people buying something from Australia?

Quote taken from the article:
“As alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, **like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act.** We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”

Been in it since April and never once even considered Gox as an option.  Perhaps I pay more attention than most, but it *always* seemed shady...

I have used Amagi with great results!  Ordered just before Christmas and had Silver in my hands in a few weeks.  Not too bad considering the holidays!
10/10 Would use again

Well I have BTC as well, but I collect coins and wanted a token from the year I got into crypto.  Also, whatever upside potential BTC itself has, this will have that plus the premium of being a graded coin.

Been using Cryptsy since they opened...never had a problem.  Give them some time to respond to the support request, they do sometimes take a little while to get to them.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:40:19
You only lose that money when you sell, plain and simple...
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:08:50
To add to this...remember that you only lose money when you sell.  Took me a few bad trades to learn that lesson!  Just be patient :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:11:07
[Here's]( another one, just not graded
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:52:25
Hit up their Twitter.  Took me 9 months to get back my 10k PXC/ 1BTC, but they finally did make good on it.
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:03:05
I appreciate it...I got a great deal on them initially, so I'm not out much.  Just sucks that at one point they were worth ~1.35 Bitcoin and now they are worth just over one Litecoin.
Just don't want anyone else to get screwed like I did :)
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:02:41
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:49:41
Choo Choo motherfucker!
@_date: 2014-12-19 08:11:54
Bought it that way, but you should be able to send them to ANACS yourself for grading.  Found it on eBay, got it from the guy directly.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:11:37
Folder named wallet?
Yep...sounds kinda fishy to me
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:13:33
Typically graded coins will command a premium over loose ones.  Not sure of their exact process, but basically you send them the coins and some weeks later you receive them back in slabs if they made the cut.  ANACS is typically a little loose with their grading.
I know what you mean about being one of the only people to handle them, but the added value and security of having it slabbed are worth it to me.
I want to say the 2012's may be worth a little more, but I'm not sure.  I think they actually made the most that year since it was the first full year of production.
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:02:24
I think they should have handled it by now if that's the case...weeks is unacceptable.  How many tickets have you sent in?
You can always hit up  on twitter and tell them you're having trouble getting the issue looked at after weeks.  That tends to get things cleared up in a timely matter :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:09:19
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:00:58
I've been using them since they opened...no problems so far!
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:02:23
Why can't you leave negative feedback?
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:25:32

Basically, there is a private key to an address that houses 1 BTC under the hologram.
You can go [here]( to check the digits shown on the coin and see the address they correspond to.

That sucks :/
Can't say enough good things about Amagi Metals...missed the 15 minute deposit window and had an email from support the next morning telling me that they had worked everything out.  Received my shipping confirmation today and given the level of customer service thus far, I suspect what I receive will be spot on.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:01:57
If I had 8000 BTC, I'd be soooo happy...
