As a crypto trader with no experience with stock exchange, I'm curious what limitations there are to trading in gbtc? Like some stuff in crypto land is every day business, but would have sec down your throat if you did it with gbtc, right?

If you can afford a decent GPU, and have cheap electricity, just mine a decent altcoin for a few to several months. Hold your coins until they they are worth at least 3x the GPU + electric. This is the best way to get started, because you will also learn more about crypto currencies by mining them. And with some luck or picking good coin to mine, you may make 1000%+ profit in little time

You can't leave out stuff like Fontas and the pump + dump action, that was the most riveting part for a lot of us in the early days. You know, trying to ride the waves of mad manipulation and troll box hype, yelling Rise Chickun! and all that stuff. This is the spectacle that turned boring nerd money into something exciting, a key part of its history
