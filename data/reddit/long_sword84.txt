The issue isn't whether or not to use cash. They're only taking these measures to ensure they can successfully implement negative interest rates. Negative interest rates are the real issue here.

How rich are you talking? There's plenty of people who could be considered wealthy, but don't get their money from "fucking over others".


Has that ever worked in the history of the world? Where?


Sorry snowflake, but life isn't fair. Some people are better at making money than others, should they be punished for that? Some people are poor because they are lazy, and will always be poor and lazy. Should they be rewarded for that?

Fractional reserve banking systems. When they loan money they create new capital, but they require repayment of capital + interest. They don't create the interest. There is never enough money to repay capital + interest.

I agree. It would be a good thing on a country level, if the government created the money instead of banks. 
However it's not a good thing for investors or savers. Spending more than we earn (via credit growth) is, in effect, punishing savers to reward those who borrow. Negative interest rates means no cash reserves will be held anywhere, it will all be funnelled into a giant credit bubble before the whole thing implodes.

Good luck with it. I used to think like that too, but life experience showed me it's a pointless pursuit. In fact giving money directly to very poor people often causes irreparable damage to them and their family.
As for taxing people to give to the poor. It's basically theft and wealthier people usually have the smarts and the means to move where taxes are more favourable.
@_date: 2019-02-17 10:15:58
Because opening the door on negative interest rates will inevitably lead to hyperinflation. It will essentially cost money to hold cash, and encourage reckless borrowing (money creation). It will force holders of cash to seek out investments that are immune to the hyperinflation. Like precious metals and crypto.
It will probably boost a lot of crypto prices, but IMO Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that could handle larger investment volumes needed by institutions. It also has a longer track record and will be viewed as being more reliable and stable.

The main points are that Baby Boomers don't have enough for retirement. That Millennials are effectively priced out of most mainstream investments. That the governments protect mainstream investment at all costs (real estate, stocks, bonds ...). This leaves crypto as possibly the most accessible and attractive alternative for Millennials.
