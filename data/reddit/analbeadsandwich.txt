tell me what you know about my life, and how well im doing at my life, because all u seem good at is taking a dump on somebody you know jackshit about, im guessing u think im looking to get rich off some online casino which is not even the case. thats the straight talk but if u don't have any help fuck off, i have many reddit accounts i made this account for a reason a very good reason, i'm not going to explain my reasons to you or anyone else that's none of their business. but if you don't have anything useful to provide save your time sitting me down and giving me life advice. Id say i'm doing pretty damn good at life having started from nothing, and now am worth over 7 figures and im only in my mid 30s so give me a lawyer or fuck off thanks

im very much aware, its not a new idea there are tons of casinos and i spoke with not a lawyer but an expert and he still says i should speak to a lawyer but if there are issues then there are "legal work arounds" other then moving to costa rica. and i would like to speak to a lawyer in regards to this its very important so if some one actually can point me in the right direction it would mean alot

yes i understand this i'm told that its technically not illegal to gamble with bitcoin online because its not the same as USD, So that i probably won't need a gambling license, however if i did i have a solution for this. However the question is when i goto cash out the bitcoin i need to verify if i will have problems "legally" i will be setting up a company and paying taxes etc. but this is a the concern. and if i can't deal with people in the usa, then i can possibly do business with people in other countries. (even thought people could use VPNs and proxies in the usa to get around this im guessing) but this was not told to me by a lawyer but from an expert in online gambling who also knows alot about bitcoin gambling sites. However this person couldn't provide me with a lawyer because they are not from the USA.
