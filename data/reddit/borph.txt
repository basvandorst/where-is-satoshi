Hehe, I had to log in just to give you credits about your comment! True...

Didn't know that site, thanks! But looks like they will own the funds in the meantime? Although they promise to transfer back when the fund was not claimed, a printed private key seems easier for me.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:36:07
I just made an account as international customer (German), and while they would ship to Germany they don't offer me the Bitcoin checkout option. Pity :-(
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:29:38
IMHO one problem of Bitcoins for real world transactions (like such tip) is the fact that it is not tangible :-(
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:56:53
The code 'HappyBitcoin' doesn't work anymore?!
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:39:08
"The Pay with Bitcoins option is only available for orders placed on our US shopping site. This payment option is not yet available on the Mobile or International website versions."

Wait, the number of LN transactions per on-chain transaction is fixed?! Didn't know that, what is the technical reason?
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:43:46
Ah ok, the PoW has to be done also for the fake chain. A fresh node validating two chains starting at genisis chooses the longer, and an attacker would have to do the same amount of work or more than the "real" chain.
But the PoW depends on the difficulty. Can the fake chain not simply claim the difficulty was pretty low most of the time?
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:31:03
Hum, sounds like an interesting idea! So creating an identity is expensive, and you are periodically asked to proof you are there. But if this is needed for each block, why do you say that the history of blocks is not protected?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:11:45
Wow, you point out a very important detail I didn't realize before. When you define winning chain as the one with the most work, everything becomes easier. Not as vulnerable as longest with a given difficulty, and the difficulty just becomes an instrument for the block frequency. I guess "work" is defined as the sum of all block hashes, the smaller the more work?
This also means the proof of idle can't work, true.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:04:55
Can you elaborate? Whether VPS or root server shouldn't matter, but you refer maybe to the economical importance of a node?
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:52:15
Technically right, but I trust my small datacentre to have little interest in what I'm running. With a node at home you have more trust but less bandwith. And you have to trust all software to be compiled correctly, running on Windows a no-go then.

Used, mine:

Oh I should maybe say it's not my business. It's a friend and I told her about Bitcoins and now she accepts them! In case someone is interested: she translates also software like Android apps.
@_date: 2013-04-21 11:39:00
What's the problem? Would connect number plates with names, sure, but how many pages have even more sensitive data of me? Credit cards, bank account, home address. I guess you have to trust that site. Id-card instead of driver's licence wouldn't make a difference. And to sign up with just an email would lead to people just registering a lot of accounts to get the tips.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:54:07
I get 502 Bad Gateway
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:08:42
yep :-)
@_date: 2013-08-30 12:29:24
That's what a lot of Germans doing. Still it's too slow for good arbitrage.
@_date: 2013-08-30 12:28:35
I got my fiat in about 4 days - Germany.
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:29:35
As I see now from the other comments: OTPs are not a solution for man-in-the-middle (and so phishing). OTPs are context-free!
Although I agree with "every little helps" the idea of "something you have" authentification is not that secure as I thought. It would be safer if you would have to enter a hash of the transaction into your Google Authenticator or so....
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:49:09
Crazy how many Altcoins are around! Never heard of most of them...Junkcoin, tststs..

If you get this:
the Chrome wallet verifier plugin is intercepting.
Deactivate in the options to access your local wallet cache.

Indian, Biryani, and very yummie!
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:12:38
I'm guessing, but I think you transfer fiat to Fidor and they see bitcoin.de as their 'outsourced marketplace'. So you do your transaction on bitcoin.de and can withdraw again from Fidor.
Sounds like MtGox but with German account. Actually I liked the way bitcoin.de worked: the transfers are from user to user, there is no account to seize.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:22:51
Wasn't a good deal in that sense: Bill was 25,80€, BitPay charged 0.1177 BTC, showing a rate of "1 BTC = 219.1889 EUR", which was quite below the current rate on MtGox at that time. But because of volatility (it went up again) the bill is "now" 30.47€.
Anyway, I wanted to support Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:28:29
lieferservice.de is a 3rd party website, I could have ordered even in the restaurant's site directly, but not with Bitcoins. They forward and pay the order to the restaurant in fiat I think. Wouldn't have taken lieferservice.de as a 'proxy' if it wouldn't be for the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:52:49
As a German who used to work in UK I never understood the restrictive rules. Several innocent pages were blocked, even the normal phone register. I could not Google for the word Staatsexamen because of the Sex in it. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:31:52
Question: When the phishing site gets your credentials and the OTP (two factor), would it be possible to log into MtGox on your behalf?
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:54:39
Ah and don't forget to re-activate after downloading your wallet :)
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:45:40
Ok, that makes sense. I always thought of a SYN flood.
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:16:09
Interesting that the linked "Durchsuchungsbefehl" (search warrant) clearly states that Bitcoin is an internet currency!
"[...] dass er weder Willens noch in der Lage ist, ihnen die Internetwährung 'Bitcoin' zu verschaffen."
=&gt; "[...] that he doesn't want or will not be able to give them the internet currency 'Bitcoin'."
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:02:51
Why are links on that page like "file:///C:/My%20Web%20Sites/tryagain/blockchain.info/wallet/index.html" (I'm on ubuntu)?
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:43:05
How does a 'remote invite' work? I guess the barkeeper is not keen on waiting next to you until you send an email to your friend and he then makes the transfer?
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:09:43
Yes, was at a council's IT department. Strict firewall, but using only telnet on the other hand. I explained them SSH, but they were like 'ah, we don't need, we have switches, not hubs'.

How about amazon.de? Would be neat!

I also don't mind to spend the 'precious' Bitcoins now on that, Bitcoin needs real-life transactions!

Indian food, Biryani.

Nothing in general, but the trick with Bitcoins is: you can be your own bank. So you tend to have only a necessary amount in the bank. So: the way Bitcoin works in particular.

I have no information, but I would assume that's against their Terms Of Service.
(edit) Actually that's how eBay works: you have a huge lock-in effect. That's the reason why eBay was so cheap in the beginning.

Ha I liked that linked map! So USA is basically the only middle-endian country? It gives us at work also a daily headache :-/

Interesting parts:
"Fidor pay account is the first account which identifies both EUR and Bitcoin balance, just like a modern account should do."
"At Fidor bank we have a lot of experience, we even consider this as our core competence. For good reasons we are already in crowd financing or peer-to-peer lending, at a time, where other banks are still questioning if this is legal."

I just registered and chose to email me a new password, because I wanted to change it after. Now it doesn't let me change it. Do I have to submit my whole life data (id, account no etc) before I may change away from a password which was totally unprotected in an email?
(edit) Support wrote me to use the password recovery mechanism.

You are right, the DB is probably pretty memory consuming. Pity, as it's always on.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:07:10
I would, if anyone has an easy solution for an Synology-NAS. Its always on and I would open 8333 for it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:38:04
Yes and no. The indian restaurant gets (IMO) Euros, but for me it was an exchange of Bitcoins agains food.
With the baseball card I would agree with you, but somehow the baseball card indeed bought you indirectly a beer. If I remember correctly, the first purchase of two pizzas with 10000btc was not direct, either. They were paid with a credit card, and someone over the ocean just made the credit card transfer in return of 10k bitcoins, so you can not say that bitcoin was buying a pizza.

You need internet (obviously), just to mention because you might have low coverage. But I also tried once the Bluetooth feature of Schildbach's wallet, works!
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:30:33
Funny thing: That restaurant is just down the road, 100m, would have walked, but I was so keen in pushing Bitcoins to real world that I ordered online :-)
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:20:54
Yes, I just thought the same. Shit, this means in theory the man-in-the-middle attack is unstoppable with respekt to the two-factor authentication. The only thing which helps is looking at the address.
That is the reason that with online banking you have this TAN-number generating device which displays you the destination account number. The TAN is only valid for this very transaction.

Yes, the GEMA is getting a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:05:46
Nice! How do I decrypt the private key? Some standard Linux commands how-to would be nice.
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:44:48
So your comment about two factor has nothing to do with phishing, has it?
