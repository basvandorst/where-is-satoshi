No one should put all their money in any one thing.
But no one has.
The valuations you are seeing are from thousands and thousands of people making a decision to put some of their money in cryptos. They are all wise and rational decisions therefore the values are wise and rational and well established by widely distributed decisions.

Good info


I like how the Trezor is completely open-source (software AND hardware), so that people have even built their own Trezors from scratch[1] [2], compiled the firmware themselves and ran it on their own creations. Plus the button layout is more convenient (you can use it with one hand, while I feel like you need to use both hands on the Ledger Nano S).
But the Ledger Nano S carries more altcoins, and is less recognizable (looks like a normal USB stick). And it supposedly has a secure element protecting your private keys. But it has closed-source hardware, if you're paranoid about that.

The issue is the unannounced change to procedure this implies but does not specify to old timers who have coin in paperwallets they have backedup.
Indeed it inspires the exact wrong behavior for those people which will cause them to lose their money. 
They will scan a paper walle to check it since prices have risen. Maybe transfer some test funds to make sure it still all works. Then they will wipe or destroy the phone to ensure it cant be used to steal money from their now checked paper wallet they still beleive holdstheir money and still works.  Thus they will lose all the money by following what would have been good safety pritocils from a fewyears ago in original bitcoin specifications. Now that procedure is the exact opposite of what needs to be done to protect coin..
Hence "they changed stop light colors to green and didnt post giant warnings"
Any wallet doing this must announce in full screen before scanning any paper wallet:
"warning! procedures have changed! if you scan your paper wallet all your stored privatekey backups will become useless and your funds will be moved to addresses you dont have the private keys for. Is this what you want to do?"
Followed by this screen
"are you absolutely fucking sure because if not stop"
Or alternatively  "do you want to spend some funds from this paper wallet and keep the rest in it so your existing paper private key backups for this wallet still work?"

This is so stupid.
Bitcoin added value and did what it was supposed to do the day it started. Therefore it isnt a bubble. It is a working assrt.
There are only 21 million ever to be made and it has umlimited storage of value in a world market of asset valuation in the mnay many trillions of dollars.
It works far better than gold as a store of value yet has far less than marketcap of gold therefore it is not overvalued. It is undervalued. To be equal to gold it will be $330,000. 
It is way under valued...just as it was when it was $1000, or $600, or $30, or $1, or 10 cents , or .0001 cent or all those other times when people who dont understand what bitcoin is or the size of world asset markets said it was overvalued.

This is what should happen and frankly should have happened years ago if not for all the mainstream media fud that was put out there.
For bitcoin to take its proper place and move to its normalized rational high value world wide every person needs to have some bitcoin just like they might have some stocks and some bonds. When that happens when  there are only 21 million coins then each coin goes to over 1 million each and people are protected from the ravages of fiat money inflation.

Its important to remember the guidelines have only said you owe taxes when exchanging crypto "virtual currency" for OTHER TYPES OF PROPERTY or services.
No IRS guideline has specifically said that you owe taxes on gains when exchanging one cryptofor another.
This is despite many people on this subreddit saying the IRS must have somehow "forgotten" to mention that - despite other things being specifically mentioned as taxable and many irs lawyers no doubt going over the guidelines language with a fine tooth comb and omitting any mention of exchanging crypto for crypto as taxable.
Many cpas who apparently dont really know what crypto is seem to think little different coins actually exist as physical things when in fact it is all just data on a series of connected blockchains which are repeatedly changed and converted constantly.
You can either beleive the irs after long study didnt understand that and made a mistake in their guidelines or you can beleive a little cpa on the corner who has no idea what crypto software actually is.
Disclaimer. Not a lawyer or adviser. These are my personal opinions which i beleive are backedup by the irs guidleines, the senate oversight committee reponse to those guidleines and the reporting requirements negotiated between coinbase and the irs that only required reporting when crypto is exchanged for CASH and NOT when crypto is exchanged for crypto.
But this is just my laymans opinion.
And that being said remember it is important to pay all taxes you owe. Dont be an idiot.

i am not suggesting people file for like kind.
I am suggesting the irs guidance indicates by omission from an otherwise comprehensive list  that for virtual currency to virtual transactions there is no reporting requirement at all just as they agreed with Coinbase.
 (see below for a caveat)
The irs guidance listed many specific instances of when taxes would be due.
Do you think they just happened to forget to mention the largest crypto activity (trading crypto for crypto) out there if they meant for it to be taxed?  You think all the peoppe working on that guidance for weeks just all discussed everything and listed them but jist FORGOT to say "if you trade virtual currency for virtual currency then you owe tax"?  They listed all those other things like getting paid in virtual currency for work and trading virtual currency for OTHER types of property  but not that...because they FORGOT?
Your argument is ridiculous.
 But.. hey... you better assume they forgot to say that exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide is taxable so you better calculate the value of the oxgen you breathed in and the co2 you breathed out and pay cap gains on he changein value during the breathe. Thats your logic becuase obviously the irs just forgot to mentio  that and assumed you would know because oxygen and carbon dioxide have value on the chemical market.
Oh and you need to stand in line today. How do I know? because the IRS forgot to tell you to stand in line. So obviously you must stand in line. Because obviously they forgot to say it but thats what they meant.
Edit: reporting requirments. Caveat. There may be other reasons you need to report ownership of virtual currency to any tax authroity other than a requirement to pay or not pay tax on it. In those cases it seems the irs doesnt recognize different named coins as different property so perhaps the best thing to do is list it all as "virtual currency" without breakdowns. After all not all things in this space are physically different or can be broken down because its all a software ledger and some even go furfher such as ethereum where you control some different tokens under one ethereum address..so there is no difference again in a software ledger.
Also remember ethereum was originally created by tying control of ethereum network addresses to the xburning" intentional destruction of bitcoin addresses so those networks are directly originally interconnected.
I am guessing that the irs looked long and hard at virtual currency after all the congressional testimony and exchanges with thecongressional committees decided all virtual currency is indistishguishable even though it has different characteristics and is more akin to painting the same property adifferent color than buying different property. You dont have to pay capital gains on a pickup truck sale if you paknt you pickup truck a different color but never sell it for cash.
And thatis probably the right way to look at virtual currency.
And if you dont beleive the painting analogy let me remind you that the idea of other "coins" like ethereum literally came from early discussions of what were literally called "colored coins".  Look it up.
So a repaint may be the best way to look at "swapping" one coin for another. (remember x
"coins" dont actually exist. They are actually participation in a peer to peer software ledger and thatis all they are. They are like one cell in a vast network of many pages in many excel spreadsheets all automatically connected to other excel spreadsheets. Moving the contents of one cell to another cell shouldnt be taxed. Howwever selling your position in the spreadsheet network (which inckudes ALL virtual currencies since they are ALL one big network connecred through automatic exchanges)  for cash or other goods or services should be taxed

No. There is no regulation that can be made that can do anything except keep the small person out of the best investment opportunities.
You do realize the only reason 90% of the people who have made money in crypto and improved it including passive holders is because crypto was NOT covered by all the regulations?
You cant even BUY early investments of new startup companies unless you are an accredited investors with lots of money already. All poor people are locked out of any chance to make the REAL gains in stocks becuase of those regualtions...and the wealthy like it that way leaving them more and cheaper pre IPO deals with exorbitants profits.

I have been audited. (although before bitcoins even existed).
It was no problem.
Furthermore i know many people who have been audited. Many know their local irs agent by name because i know a lot of real estatepeople and they get audited all the time (even the Presidnet is audited all the time)
None of it is criminal. They always find discrepancies but thatdoenst mean they are criminal. Many things are matters of interpretations and procedural difference. Many times if the examiner disagrees they will say so and give you the choice to kick it to a higher examiner or test your interpretation in court . Thst doesnt mean its criminal. If the examiner orcourt agrees with you nothing changes . Otherwise they may require you to redo your taxes and pay more (or less). Sometimes they require a penalty but often they dont. Penalties are negotiatble based on your intent and honesty. They can waive them. They can even waive owed taxes. They can also put you on payment plans for partial taxes.  None of thst is scary or criminal.
If you lie or conceal assets you arerequired to declare or say you didnt do something you did or hide assets then that is criminal and things change. But that is very different from what we are talking about here.
The result of all of this is that real estate people alwyas get the best accounts they can to interpete tax law in the most advantagoues way possible and pay as little taxes as legally justifia le each year. Then if the irs examiner says they owe morethey pay them. So the worst thing is an irs agent says you owe more and you pay it and perhaps some penalties but not often if not bad intent on confusing law.

Bitcoin's goal wasnt to produce profits.
It was to produce a decentralized system of storing wealth and making payments.
It did that from day one.
It has produced profits in two ways. 
1. Making those goals possible and usually and cheaper prices than would be available in the marketplace if they were being provided and
2. For the holders of the bitcoins becuase as bitcoin adoption increased a place at the table became worth more money.
People forget that even higher transaction fees are a sign of bitcoins success and adoption and thefactthat people are willing to pay them in a constant fee bidding process shows thecale of the network to them at that moment.
And the value in both metrics is very very high.

So here is the real description.
You choose to adjust a software parameter fo adjust your software peer to peer network to another network and maintian your id status on the network and then adjust your software peer to peer network to another software peer to peer network.
Now where is the taxable event?
However lets say you sell your position on the software peer to peer network to someone for cash.
Obviously a taxable event.
There are no coins.
Those are just cartoon words and pictures that are used to make it easy for people to visualize something they cannot understand otherwise.
There are no little gold coins with B's printed on them. They dont really exist. You are a identified on a peer to peer network. That is all.

A very good point.
There are two type sof peopme who buy bitcoin.
One who buys thinkin it is going to go up to a certain point nsd they should sell. They will never getthe full value and likely will always sell for a small multiple of fheir initial investment.
The other type is the type that just buys and holds and absolutely never thinks about when they should sell. They realize bitcoin IS the ultimate repository. They only sell a small amount to buy what they need for their life.  These are the ones who get rich.
Its not about guessing wrong as to when you sell.

Now how often have you had a peice of paper stolen from your safe deposit box?
How often have you had a previously used bitcoin address be hacked after it was used once and showed up on the blockchain?
Case closed.
And yet you are arguing thst hsnd writing 12 words and then hand transcribing or somehow making secure copies of thise are somehow safer than having a private key for a reused address in a safe deposot box (or elsewhere clever)
Sorry but you are deluded.
You have created a circle of procedural failure where the procedure itself will more likely cause the loss of the coins it is trying to protect.
By the waydid you throw away the whole pad of paper that you wrote your twelve words on? becuase if you didnt someone could trace those words from the next sheet of paper  in the pad...or a wooden table if you wrote on a wooden table.
Or anyones cmaera that was watching while you wrote.
Or the commercial copy machine you used to copy the hand  written words becuase you couodnt print them on your own home printer.

I honestly cannott imagine what anyone was thinking who thought that was a better real world solution thsn the long stnading oractice of having home printed multiple paper backups of private keys for addresses that didnt change.

People dont WANT that behavior.
People want to avoid it.
It negates all the physical backip solutions they already have for their paper wallet addresses. It makes them all useless.
The minute you sweep am address you have no backip for tuos efunds. They are all on a flimsy, finicky phone which always have a tendency to die or get dropped in the ocean at the worst possible time. Now they can do it with possible huge money stuck in them.  Its insane.
And now developers want you to write down tweleve words?  Which is contrary to everything the old timers were taught about the sanctitiy of their paper wallets they have their funds in?  Having that paper copy of twelve words  is every bit as risky as having a private key on a piece of paper  that someone could find except you have lost the convenience of being able to scan a qr code for your funds.  And suddenly all your funds are in one solution again whereas with paper wallets you can at least easily spread them among multiple addresses you keep in separate physical locations for safety.
So suddenly to avoid that you have to keep separate instances of software running with separate tweleve word solutions on separate devices.
And all this for what reason?  When privatekeys are already impossible to crack!?
With behavior and bone head wallet developments like this pretty soon all bitcoins will be lost forever.
Heres another idea!
Lets make people dance and remember and replicate all their dance moves in the future using the accelerometer on their phone . And if they cantt they lose all their funds! that way those funds will be really safe from theives and there will be no written private keys or twelve words!  But sorry if you get older and try to remember your dance and perform it with your newly broken leg!   Because you will lose all your money FOREVER!  But your funds are safe from theives!

Remote Area Medical
DID YOU KNOW?
1 out of 10 Americans lacks access to basic medical care. Remote Area Medical’s mission to prevent pain and alleviate suffering by providing free, high-quality health care to those in need is made possible by donors like you.
“Thanks to the generosity of our donors, Remote Area Medical is the nation’s premier provider of free, quality health care by way of mobile medical clinics and a massive volunteer corps. On behalf of each person impacted by your support, I thank you for being the reason a child can see clearly for the first time and for sharing our vision to prevent pain and alleviate suffering.
When together we treat a patient, we change a life. When we treat hundreds of patients, we transform a community. When we transform communities, we can change the health of our nation, one mobile medical RAM clinic at a time.”
This organization holds giant free medical care clinics in stadiums around the usa leveraging volunteering local doctors and dentists to see people for free really leveraging the money so it doesnt go into providers hands. It goes to expendables and medicine and travel costs.
Its run by Stan Brock  is the guy who famously wrestled the Acaonda in the river while marlin perkins stood on shore in the old Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom nature show popular in the 1970's.
They fly a little DC3 around the country and take truck caravans and sign up local doctors and dentistswho provide free care in the big stadiums or parking lots where the events are organized.

And remember if the irs wnated to say trading one virtual currency for another was taxable they could have clearly said that. They did not.

Edit: found a video of a guy buying bitcoin from an atm in NY state in the USA which is pretty heavily regulated.  the first half of the video is him driving for some reason.
He goes to atm. It asks how much he wants to buy. There seem to be two categories. He chooses the lower category amount (i am guessing this means less id is required bit i dont know. Does anyone know?) . It asks for his phone number then texts him a 4 digit number code like a pin number. It asks for that code. He types it on the touchscreen. It asks whether he wants to let it scan his depositr address qr code (so he could have a wallet on his phone or a paper wallet), or have the atm print out a new paper wallet or let him type in the address.(must be hard as hell). It scans his phone wallets qr address. It asks him to deposit cash. He puts in $20 . It sends the bitcoin to his wallet. He gets a notice he is receiving coin on his phone from either his wallet or his text. Hard to tell but appears to be from his phone wallet software. He gets a paper receipt from the machine that appears to show thecash tendered, date and perhaps wallet receiving. Done. So thats buying.

Get several paper wallets and hide them separately to divide your risk of losing it all. Put some of your bitcoin in some of those.
Or at least copy and paste some addresses and private keys in separate groups  several different places .
Not all in one place.

You need to spread the risk of loss.

So you are giving advise that is specifiically contrary to the guidlines given by the irs relating to when taxes are owed regarding crypto transactions. They spefifically listed wje  it is owed. They specifically did NOT mention the circumstance when crypto is traded for crypto.
Explain your source for this extraordinary  projection tha you are making.
you areclaiming the irs did  not state what they meant and they totally ignored a circumstnace of owed tax that they failed to mention even though they specifically mentioned virtually every other conceivable circumstance.
So why do you think you know more about what the irs meant than what the irs themselves said in a guidline they no doubt pent a lot of time thinking a out and writing in consuktation with many otjers. Do you think the irs simply forgot that people trsde crypto currencies for crypto currencies and thst the irs mesnt to say that was taxable but just forgot to say it?
Becuase they sure could have said thst quite clearly in a simple sentenfe like they did for other things.  but they did not.
I bekeive if they wsnted to say it was taxable to swap cryptos they would have an therefore since they did not then they did nit mea  o imply it.
Its not up to you to put unstated words and sentenfes in irs statements.. the irs can do tust if that is what they mean.

Thats EXACTLY the PROBLEM. 
Because old timers dont know this.
Because that isnt the way mycellium or electrum (and maybe others) used to work. 
Its the OPPOSITE of how they used to work. They used to return your changeto your original paper wallet because that wsstue one you presumably had backups of your private keys for. So it was the safe thing to do. (and still is)
So unless old timers receive the warning they will be keeping their old paper wallet privatekeys that they alresdy know are in some safe place as they have been for years and smashing their (burner)phones to protect the old address funds if they were substantial and in the process lose all their remaining funds from their old paper wallet.
Literally this new behavior by phone wallet software will cause suicides when old timers lose all their bitcoin and discover it..
I cant beleive no one has raised this issue and that this default wallet behavior change ever got implemented.
It literally destroys the age old Prime Directive of Bitcoin which is (or was) "If you own your private keys you own your bitcoins"

I woukd start with a paper wallett.
Its very easy to understand.
The paper has your password and wallet address (your wallet address is like a safedeposit box number and mailbox address. Money can be sent there but No one can get in though without the password). 
All the online and on phone software wallets are very complicated to new people . Its very very easy to lose your money with those if you mistype something or forget your passwords..
With a paper wallet you have your bitcoin as long as you have a copy of the paper with the address and password on it.  Or you can take a picture of it too .
You can put a copy in your safe deposit box at the bank.
You can bury it in your backyard as backup.
You can take a photo of it.
Just remember if anyone else gets a copy or a copy of the photo then they have access to your .money. bit its very hack proof since it is not on a computer.

Bitcoin in my view is like a lottery ticket that has a very logical sound reason for all tickets to be large winners while at the same time virtually no chance of being worth zero and always affording the holder of the ticket the opportunity to get are fund whenever they sent.
Who wouldnt buy that ticket if it was sold at dispensers where lotto tickets are sold today?  And billions of dollars of far worse lotto tickets are sold every month that have virtually no chance of winning, become worth zero after their drawing in one week and offer no refund opportunity after the purchase.. yet people buy those every week.

In the old ways  you did a partial spend form an address you had the private keys for. Thoseprivate keys were securely stored somewhere. Likely several places depending on your individual security practices.
Since the same address was reused you never had to back up anything more than once becuase you had the orivat e keys.

Personnally i think it will at least rise to $300,000 per coin .
Thats 20x your moneytoday. that would substantially increase anyones net worth . Its still life changing.
Furthermore many many think it can overover 1 million per coin and with good reason.
If someone only invests 1/10 of their savings then if it goes ups up 10 x they have doubked their savings. Thats HUGE for anyone.
If it goes up 20 x then they Triple their savings. 
And thats only investing 1/10 of their savings.
And  thats with very little risk of losing it all (even if bitcoin goes down it will always be around and usually rise again) and very good reason to expect high returns.  Mich higher than other opportunities out there.
People should never "risk it all"   but its a very rare opportunity for high return on a reasonable investment.

So we need the boss in their weekly office meeting totell examiners to remember to "not just issue a patent for a preexisting or obvious practice just because someone added the words 'with a cryptocurrency' to the application."

The spirit of the law is they dont want to tax crypto to crypto trades. If they did they would have clearly said so.
You are imagining a spirit of the law that doesnt exist.

More people lose coin by forgetting passwords than robbery or hacking.
You dont have everything in one wallet.
You lose a password..yes you can lose that one wallets contents. But you still have others. Protectthe wallets. Many ways to do it.
But people forget passwords all the time even in good health. So many people lose coins becuase they forgot the passwords. A lot more than get get robbed or hacked.
Also you can change one letterin a privatekey and make it unusuaboe. Change all letters matching you dogs name first letter to firdt letters of your cats name for example and storethat.
Or add a number you would know to the last 4 digits of a private key for example or whatever you come up with. For example maybe you roll the last 4 digits of your key by 5 for example.
Ma y ways to do it with a procedure so you don t have to remember a passphrase.
You can then keep the procedure separate from the addresses.

Were not talking about like kind exchanges.
That os another specific area of tax law.
For something to be like kind you have to first agree theyare actually different property.  NO one has determined whether one denomination of virtual currenciy is different property .
Remember what we call xone bitcoinx doenst actually exist. The little coin in the pictures is not a real coin. Its not a physical thing.
Its all softsare.
Literally its all software residing in different pockets of software .
It akin to having the contents of one cell in an Excel spreadsheet versus contents of another cell in the same Excel spreadsheet.
Its all just software.  It doesnt physically exist.
Now one day if someone makesthe legal determination it does exist then maybe then one cpuod mkae the argument the property is lioe kind and tryo apppy tue liie kind exchanfe law which is primarily usedin real estste for swapping different peices of real estate. However apparently evne then you couldnt becuase the new tax bill jist passed apparently just specifically defines like exchanges as real estate onpy for the first time in law

This is exactly why all this "security" and " privacy"  change addressnonsense is a terrible idea.
All change should be returned to the original wallet address unless the wallet owner SPECIFICALLY CHOOSES TO HAVE IT GO TO NEW ADDRESSES.
its the fault of the wallet that this person lost their money. He should sue the fuck out of those wallet creators.
Its ridiculous to say secretly stashing someones money in a new address that the owner doenst have a backup for is a better thing. Phones crash and are lost. There is danger in the backup process as well whereas having a paperwallet backup in a safe deposit box is a one time process that should not have to be repeated everyone time a wallet is used.
Mycellium luckily allows you return all unspent funds to the original address.
It should be the default behavior for all wallets.
Addresses and bitcoin is complicated enough. All this triple trickery to try to ensure more privacy is dangerous overkill as are triple passwords etc.
More people lose coins to this nonsense than areever actually stolen.

Bitcoin isnt risky unless you borrow to own it.
Its not a lottery ticket which expires so unless you cant hold it it isnt risky becuase the investment never runs out. So as long as you only invest savings not needed for daily living expenses then holding bitcoin isnt risky.
In fact bitcoin is far less risky long term than any company stock because every company carries some degree of debt and loss of product chain value and legal risk as well as national soveirngty existence risk.
The bitcoin ecosystem carries no debt and is not internally leveraged. It does not have to experince internal revenue to continue to exist. If tomorrow every single commercial mining hub went out of existence bitcoins difficultly would adjust and it would exist just fine (some say better) on just a backbone of distributed volunteers using their personal computers just as it started and flourished.  Its fundemental properties of scarciity and transferability across national lines never will expire. 
Apple will run out of products to sell before bitcoins fundemental values expire because bitcoins fundemental usefulness will NEVER expire.

At a minimum.
Thats only gets to gold marketcap at $340,000 or so which is the minimum logical place in  the finance world for bitcoin which has all the attributes of gold as an alternative store of wealth with much more convenience and a fixed more limited supply.
Furthermore considering that value is based on 21,000,000 bitcoins when there ar eactually likely far far less then even at a gold marketcap basis bitcoin is probably going to be worht more than $340,000   . Maybe double that just as a gold investment wealth storage alternative replacement.
However bitcoin is far more than a gold alternative wealth storage investment and this is lilely to attrsct much more world wealth investment than gold.  Its far closer to a combination of both gokd and all bonds inthe world...especially at todays bond low yield rates.  
That makes a much much higher market cap equivelent. The bond market is worth about 40 trillion vs the gold market of 7 trillion.
So thats approx 5 times gold cap. So 5 x of $300,000 for the easy math is $1,500,000 per bitcoin PLUS the gold value so 1.8 million.
Thats just as a bond and gold equivelent.
When  you start thinking of it as a replacement for currency it gets even bigger.
The other thing to realize is as bitcoin rises fiat currencies will fall.
The above quotes are in todays currency.
When  fiat currency begins to suffer rampent inflation  loss of value as people dump fiat then those numbers will be much higher.
None of that covers the other bigger picture.
Bitcoin  will be not just an investment alternative but an actual world wealth asset itself.
Any entity who holds large wealth of oil or real estate or commodities or others will lilely hold a portion of that wealth in bitcoin simply as a transactional medium. This links bitcoin to the much higher valuations of those total markets as a whole leading to bitcoin having even larger market caps.
Ultimately bitcoin has the potential to be a ledger for all the wealth in the world. As ledger it trancends traditional marketcaps and instead trends to a mirror marker of all the worlds wealth meaning basically the total value of all bitcoin should equal the total value of all the worlds wealth.
The total wealth of the world in 2015 was estimated to be $250 trillion dollars by Credit Suisse in their annual global wealth report. That is obviously an enormous number one has trouble comprehending.
However for our purposes if just through international trading and transaction enablement bitcoin became the mirror marker ledger of all the worlds wealth then 21 million bitcoin should equall all the worlds wealth  or ...wait for it..... More than 10 million per bitcoin.
But the way wealth creation works is its additive so that bitcoin suddenly doubles the world wealth making bitcoin have room to double once more..the same way the last highest investor in a stock gives all other stock holders more wealth witbout an equivelent cash investment.
Dont get me started on how much the world wealth will expand if we start to colonize mars and the moon....yet there will still only be 21 million bitcoin to mark all that wealth....

You dont really yet feel comfortable with what Bitcoin is. It IS the place to "Cash out" .  What people are doing is "cashing out" their other more risky currencies and investments TO Bitcoin.

Not really.
Think about it.
There will always be people who think bitcoi  will be worth more. Therefore as the price falls of it falls there will be buyers to keep it up. They will increase the more it falls. This keeps the price from falling to zero in any short time frame.
Furthermore crypto has a permanent place in the world now. Therefore bitcoin will have permamnent place. It can never actually fall to zero. Proof: If tomorrow or ten years from now all of bitcoin had fallen so that you could buy all 21,000,000 million for $100 would you do it? Of course. Just on the chance it might go back ip. This of course would neve rhappe  becuade many mantly more people would make the same decision at much much higher prices.
The idea that bitcoin can go to zero is false.
Bitcoin is NOT a lottery ticket that loses all value the day after the drawing.

That's a big strecth.
And the rule with taxes is you pay what is clearly an owed tax. You do not invent your own possible taxes and then pay those.
You use all plausible legal interpretations of the law to pay the minimum taxrequired by law. Tax minimization is not a crime.
If you get audited and an agent has an opinion thst you interpreted it incorrectly you can pay the new estimated tax or file a disagreement and take the agent to tax court for a clear ruling
The irs often loses in tax court.
Either why its not a criminal charge just a clarification of interpretation of what is clealry a vague irs guideline as this discussion proves. (also remember irs guidelines arent law. Congress makes the law.. the irs guideline could be judged wrong)
Remember there is also other massive precendent for not taxing bitcoin crypto to alt crypto. Like kind exchanges in real estste. You can swap an appreciated peice of real estate for another piece worth more than the original when you bought it and pay no tax even though it is a completely different peice of property. The irs does not assume you went to cash and then bought another peice becuase you did not go to cash. Like two different pieces of land  that are both land I beleive the IRS beleives all crypto to be crypto even though bitcoin and ethereum etc are different peices of crypto. (and actually the irs actually lets you go to cash and then buy another peice of reL estate property within a short period of time and they STILL consider it a swap. But dont do that with crypto!)
I suspect this is why some US registered exchanges like Poloniex dont allow any conversions to cash because they dont want to have to track any taxable events.
Edit: remember the key to the irs is not to actively hide things or misrepresent themand to apply your reasonable interpretation consistently. 
Ie buying alts cant be non taxable when it suits you but a loss when it suits you another day.
Edit: i am not a lawyer and these are my personal opinions. Unless i see a specific law or ruling that buying one alt for another is a taxable event i am going by the guideline which only says taxable when converting to fiat. If  an irs agent later says that was wrong i'll happily pay the additional tax and argue a penalty isnt appropriate because it was a reasonable interpretation.

I wont go in to personal detsils.
But there is something to remember that is important.
No one is an expert in this area.
It is all brnad new.
The rules have not been made yet.
No court rulings on how existing laws should be applied or if they even apply have been made yet.
The laws have not been made yet.
No ones opinion is better thsn anyone elses.
This is an importsntpoint to remember.
My opinions aremy own.
They are what i am going to do absent further guidance to the contraryfrom the irs.
If the irs or the congress want to come out and say "if you traded crypto for crypto directly without going to cash then you owe taxes on the gain" then they clearly can  and it will chsnge my opinion and i will report and pay on those trades.
They clearly have made the very consciouss decision NOT TO ISSUE THAT CLEAR STATEMENT in any of their guidaince so far. Neither has the senate oversight in response to the irs guidelines. And the coinbase reporting requirement suggests the IRS only care about people who sold crypto for cash. They clearly say they are only reporting conversions to cash.
It seems pretty clear to me.
And on this my opinion is as good as anyone elses because itt is all new and there are no experts in this area.
I iust state my reasons.
They are the same as i will  statei if the irs challenges my reasoning if they ask for an explaination in an audit.. Thats fine. I have been audited before. Sometimes they say your interpretation is reasonable. Sometimes they disagree and say you owe the tax so you pay it. So what?   Its not a crime. I havent concealed anything. I havent lied. 
If the irs wanted us to pay tax on crypto to crypto trades they would have clearly specifically ssid so. They did not.

Remember if you keep it all together  you increase the risk of loss of all your bitcoin from one mistake or theft or accident.
If you keep all together in several copies in several  places you increase the risk of discovery theft and total loss but decresse the risk of total loss from destruction of one cache.
If you keep several partial caches several places you make it virtually impossible to lose everything while possibly increasing the risk of loss of some.

You dont need to go into debt to buy bitcoin and get rich.

Does it ask for id info etc? Do you send it coins from your wallet on your phone or something or from that exchange? Thanks.
Also you mention you are worried if you send 1,000,000 to exchanges they wont let you cash out. So you also had a million in coins not on an exchange or on a different exchange that doesnt care about you sending that much coin without registering?
Thats a little confusing.

I disagree about your trading desdline.
The question with bitcoins (despite the atticle) is not if they are a like kind exchange. Thsts sort of a new argument and discussion.
The question is has the irs  (and more imporrtantly congressional tax law) stated that ethereum and bitcoin are actual different or are they like a ten dollar bill or ten 1 dollar bills actually just denominatjons of the same thing.
The irs has chosen NOT to say they are different when going from crypto to crypto. They have SPECIFICALLY NOT SAID THIS.
Additiinally the congress ...even in that new bill...specifically not said this.
And the coinbase settlement on reporting to the irs specifically indicates that the irs settled that people who did NOT trade crypto for cash were NOT A reporting requirement indicating that it isnt a taxable event. Only exchanging crypto for cash is.
Like kind exchange is a different thing entirely. And yes the new tax bill likits like kind exchange to real estate.
The issue isnt are they two differnet properties that are so similiar that they are like each other or a "like kind." Like one acre of farm land swapped for anofher.
The issue is that all crypto is all considered the same thing according to irs guidlines and the specific lack of ststements saying otherwise.
Remember if you start saying one crypto is different for irs puprooses then what about spinoffs like bitcoin cashk is that a dividend or  zero baseless capital assett?
What about tokens that only exist on the ethreum blockchain and dont have their own blockchain? Are they different?
What about when the bitcoin core team actuslly changes the fundmentals of all of bitcoin? Did everyone just exchange one coin for a new coin and therefore everyone owe capital gains on all their bitcoin holdings? Do they do it when they moce coin to a new wallet ujder the new protocol? Its a huge pandoras box.
I beleive the IRS and the congress in their studyof this has specifically wisely avoided these tyoes of crippling issues but specifically NOT defining exchanging one cryto for another as a taxable event.
Because they know that woukd cripple and devastate an important new technology thst no one knows whatwill happen with it yet.
And they dont want to do it.
So they HAVENT stated you must pay capital gains if you exchange one crypto for another.  Its not clesr they even view them as separate property any moretlthan having ten 1 dollar bills is different than having one 10 dollar bill.
If you own a boat but chose to modify it by painting it a different color does that mean you sod your boat and bought a new one? No. 
Remember the irs saying "virtual cureency" is property is NOT the same as the IRS saying different virtual currencies are considered different properties.  
The irs HAS stafed that exchanging virtjal currencies for OTHER PROPERTIES OR CASH OR SERVICES is differnet and tzxable.
 Ut they have never said exchanging one virtual currency for another is differnet property.
 It isnt clesr thatit IS differnet property. Its all different sddresses in a software chain. It isnt actuslly physical at all.
Is one cell in an excel spresdsheet a different proterty than another cell in an excel spresdsheet? No.  Such is virtusl currency.

Its like there is a portion of the community that is so lost in their own dream world that they forget it all has to be useable and understandable.
There was a guy here the other day asking how to get their funds into a wallet to spend.
He literally couldnt get a straight answer anymore.
And for every person that says they understand change someone else will say they have it wrong leaving everyone petrified to move their coins into software.
If some softwarewallet doesnt return all unspent coins to the original address then they need to have a HUGE NOTICE to the user and DEMAND THE USER BACK IT UP before doing any transactions.
Its gotten so bad that now i monitor original addresses by plugging them in to blockchain.info to see if some stupid software has moved my funds without asking me.
Its absolutely INSANE to move an owners funds to a new unbackedup address without their specific permissjon. I view it as intentional stealing and misdirection of funds without permission no matter what the developers intent.
Imagine if everytime you used your checkbook the bank secretly moved all your remaining funds to another account and didnt tell you and you didnt have the online password for it or the new account numbers written down and they couldn t give them to you of you didnt know to write them down when you wrote your last check.

Only a tiny percentage of the world owns crypto.
It is no where near full acceptance.
People should pay their taxes. Its no different than buying and selling stocks that have made money. The irs expects you to pay taxes there too.  The IRS asking for tax info from a stock brokerage firm doesnt mean apple stock is suddenly going down. All stock firms report your info. Get over it.
For most jurisdictions you only owe taxes when you sell.
By panic selling you create your tax liability.
We have now been over $10,000 for many days with no significant correction because the professional money is just starting to really get in it now. That will cause much faster price rises. Hyperbolic adoption doesnt mean a bubble. It just means a good thing is being recognized. Cars. Cell phones. Many many things enjoyed hyperbolic adoption rates.
Its taken years for bitcoin to get to $11,000. Its not been irrational at all. In fact its been pretty damn slow. Primarily in my opinion because of the incorrect , irrational fear projected by both media and alternative investors who try to talk it down.
Bitcoin should have been at $1,000,000 the first week it was invented. Adoption has been incredibly slow.

Of course the one thing they all miss is that it has been parabolic since a bitcoin was worth .00001 dollars.  
So 1000 to 10,000 is not really that unusual.
And they forget to mention gold pays no dividends yet its market cap is more than 7 trillion or more than 35 times what bitcoins is. Bitcoin needs to be $330,000 per bitcoin to equal golds market cap...with no dividends so clealry dividends dont determine value.

To tranfer money you do have to use some sort of computing device whether phone or  desktop or something else.
The bitcoin system works over the internet connecting millions of users together with a ledger that is agreed to and shared by all which is why its very very difficult to say you have bitcoin that you dont have or someone didnt pay you.
By the way although no one can steal or transfer your coins without the addresses password  , They can see how much is in there and and which addresses they came from and where they went and the exact time it happened. It is a public ledger.  So of someone can link youto a particular addresstheyknow how much bitcoin you have in thataddress. This is another reason why its good to spread out your bitcoins.

In america you simply cannot choose to be a wage maker for someone else and expect to succeed.
Its not how the societyis set up.
America is set up for owners and creators. Always be that. Dont think "how can I do this today". Think "how can i hire someone else to make an income stream for me that will last?"
The most dishonest thing said about success is that it comes "from working hard".  Your whole goal should be to optimize your business so the returns are maximized for the least effort. That leads to successful business mindsets. That is what the American system is designed for and the opportunity is open to EVERYONE. That is what makes America different.
Anyone can get ten people to agree to use them to mow their lawns and then hire 2 kids to do the work.  You dont need permission form a king to start a business or have the royal endorsement to be okd to mow lawns.
This is what immigrants to america know and why they instantly start businesses like dry cleaners and lawn services and succeed with no money and no education.

Go make yourslef several paper wallets right now and print them out. So you see how they work and what they look like.  You will see they have the square little barcode qr codes that can be scanned by cameras and atms and phones. You dont have to put any money in them.
Never throw away a paper wallet  without first checking to make sure it has nothing in it.
Never put all your coins in one address. Its SO EASY to make a mistake and send them to tue wrong place or lose a phone or have a piece of paper get lost.
Never keep all your coin addresses in one place. If someone get them they have all your coins.

Honestly there isnt much place for furtures ina volatile growing commodity like bitcoin.
Futures are really better for more stablie things with long grow times  where farmers need insurance agains very abnormal swings in price that could bankrupt their farm.

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:59
let me tell you why I fundamentally I believe this is not true anymore. Number one the money that's being invested in Bitcoin now is coming from Wall Street. It's a whole new level of money that's going in. This is more akin to the time when Bitcoin was first starting in the initial adopter for getting in. This is not scared people investing their house money. These are professional investors who understand the long-term implications of Bitcoin and that its value will be huge and they're putting other people's money in and so when they get scared they don't pull the money out. Plus the additional flood of money is it such a greater scale now than it ever has been that even The Nervous Nellie's are going to be overcome by the sheer volume and flow of new money coming in from Wall Street hedge funds and things into Bitcoin. Intrinsic valuation models and speculative models and other models of pullbacks and surges are eclipsed by a fundamentally larger flow of money that is now entering Bitcoin really for the first time. A year ago there were two tiny hedge funds investing in Bitcoin. Last year there were 10. This year there will be a flood.

Also have any declarators of nonqualifying wages been classified as "tax protestors" by the irs ?

See sections 86, 90, and 93 of the Revenue Act of 1862. That was the very first income tax act, which was implemented to raise funds for the civil war.
The act uses language that is much more direct than the US Code does. It said, unequivocally, that military and government employee were taxed at 3% over $600 (IIRC). It also said anyone who rented land to fed-guv, or sold military uniforms to fed-guv, or sold food items or acted as a paid consultant to fed-guv.... WHATEVER anyone did for Fed-guv and thereby profited was taxed. Anyone who exercised a federally-connected privilege, which their private sector counterparts did not get to benefit from, was liable for the excise tax. Anything can be a taxable activity, but in order for any given activity to be a taxable activity, it must involve some fed-guv bestowed privilege. WOrking for the post office... not a right and very much a taxable activity. Selling pizzas to the White House for the White House Ball, a privilege that only ONE (or maybe 2) pizzarias get to benefit from. They provide pizza to the whitehouse, they engaged in a federally connected activity and got paid public monies for that. Those monies, and not all their other private sector activities and resulting gains, are taxed.
The founding fathers were informed by Adam Smith who wrote about Capitations and Excise taxes in "Wealth of Nations". Excises were always popular because it was regarded that those who made their living from the public purse, should give back a portion. This type of tax, Smith wrote, was much more popular among the populace... unlike a direct capitation which caused revolts. The income tax IS NOT a direct unapportioned tax, it is not a capitation. It is an excise. Not because I say so... but because the Supreme Court has said so numerous times.
The history of the tax is fascinating. I have only found ONE SINGLE SOURCE that actually tells a complete history; 
Read Cracking the Code. Read the website. All the statutes, acts, and regulations are discussed in depth.
Concerning refunds, the law allows us to go back 3 years. We can correct the record farther back, and undo liens etc, but we can only get a refund for 3 years past. Unfortunately, it is your responsibility to both know the law, and make sure your public servants stay within their due bounds, so if you've been paying in incorrectly all this time, that's considered your bad. I suggest it will greatly benefit you to learn this information.

Its true.
And its exactly how every single large holder of wealth views every new asset allocation opportunity that comes along.
One day every single international wealth holder and late adopter will have at least one fifth of their liquid assets in bitcoin. All those who figure that out earlier (like us) will have the majority of their wealth in bitcoin for the simple reason that bitcoin will have grown so much in value after they allocated some of their wealth to bitcoin.  Virtually every person on this subreddit now who has purchased will someday be in that latter category. Virtually every person who purchased last year already is.

This new  "all change to new addresses"  behavior literally is a time warp booby trap for all old timers with bitcoin .
It now basically almost makes certain anyone following original proper safety protocol with original paper wallets will now have their funds stolen by the software and moved to a new address the owner has no backup for and then when the owner smashes the phone to avoid it being used by someone else to steal his funds he will have lost all access to his money he has properly backed up by pdeviously retaining copies of his private keys multiple places since he first got into bitcoin.
This is INSANELY BAD WALLET DEFAULT BEHAVIOR.

Dumb people have had money for centuries through inheritance or simply hiring a smart investment advisor or being at the right place at the right time or hiring smart people or random chance.
Having money is not a failsafe predictor of intelligence. In fact with large amounts of money its a terrible predictor.
Its more accurate for the levels of wealth that can be gained by employment but those are rather small.
Have you ever worked with private business owners? They are often idiots except for one thing..they repeatedly  hire and fire smart people who build their business for them while allowing the owner to keep most of the rewards or be fired (which makes you wonder how smart those employees can really be)
I find generally in non breakthrough industries having wealth is more aligned with having a lower sense of altruism or fairness in splitting proceeeds of business (they are cheap or tight with money). Jobs famously wittheld stock from many early contributors to apple. Wozniak famously gavemany of his shares away before they went public.  Jobs died richer.
I would say  a lower level of altruism is the thing most associated with accumulating more money

My post is an argument against oversecurity which actual is less secure.
No phone wallet should default to moving all coins from  paper wallet to other addresses which you dont have the privatekeys for backed up like you probably do in a few ways with your original paper wallet.
A phone wallet (this means you electrum) should simply default to scanning a private key  from a paper wallet and allowing you to send some funds form it while retaining the other funds in the paper wallet which you probably have some decent physical backup system for . The phone shpuod also default to forgetting that private key until you rescan it or offering you the choice to keep it on your phone where others could spend if they got into your phone.
All the crazed privacy spending traceability issues and nonesense causing automatic different change address use have contributed to what is a far less secure system in actual use greatly increasing the chance of the loss of all coins .

Fascinating stuff.
If you are correct the government owes a hell of a refund!
Do you have a citation from the original fax code whuch shows the income tax only applies to fed gov monies and wages are defined as fed gov monies?


show parent
These will get you started; 
In layman terms, the income tax falls on activities that involve a privilege relationship to fed-guv whereby gain are realized. ie. Working as a post office employee, selling items to fed-guv, receiving social security payments. The income tax only taxes those activities whereby people receive gains and profits from public funds, from doing business with, or working directly for fed-guv.
I sell pizzas. Tens of thousands of Americans sell pizzas. Selling pizzas in the private sector isn't taxed. Selling pizzas to fed-guv for the white house ball is a privilege. Only one or two people get that privilege. The money they earn, from their sale of pizza to fed-guv is whats taxed. This is what excise means (look it up in Blacks legal dictionary); a privilege, or a cut. It turns out the income tax is a beautiful tax,we've just been duped into declaring our private sector earnings as income from a fed-guv connected activity. We've been conditioned to agree with all information returns, w-2, 1099, etc and no one bothered to teach us what the tax actually falls on or how to disagree with an erroneous information return that alleges our private sector earnings are derived from fed-guv funds. Only federal monies are supposed to be reported on w-2s and 1099 but the American people were coerced and mislead into erroneously reporting all payments, public and private. If I allege on a w-2 that the money I paid you is federal monies and you are a federal employee, and you don't rebut my assertion, then it is accepted as true. w-2 and 1099 are only for reporting taxable payments!!!!!! Yet private sector persons yearly and erroneously report private sector monies on a w-2 or 1099, thereby unwittingly and incorrectly alleging the monies are federally connected.
Wages is a custom defined legal term. If you read the relevant legislation it is clear wages means, "monies paid to federal employees". But when the US Code was written in the 1950s, all legislative topics were re-written and organized by topic. If you read the US Code only, it appears wages means "all monies paid to employees". But even employee is a custom defined legal terms. You'll learn what it is in your readings.
This rabbit hole goes deep. Continue reading. Even if you never act on this knowledge, at least you will have it.
I could type pages and pages, but it's laid out in Cracking the Code, thoroughly and succinctly.
I hope you get educated and join us in upholding the law.

Show me where in the tax code or guidance it says that if you trade one denomination of "virtual currency" (the IRS's specific category with its own IRS definition)  for another denomination of  "virtual currency" it is a stated taxable event. I will show you several instances in statements and settlements with the IRS and senate that specifically DONT say that and in fact seem to indicate the OPPOSITE.
I beleive the irs and congress intended to exclude the trading of virtual currencies from a taxable event so as not to destroy the important growing industry. I beleive they rightly beleive that having ten ethereum and one bitcoin is very similiar to having a ten dollar bill vs having ten 1 dollar bills and remember swapping those is NOT a taxable event. I beleive that is wise of congress becuase this is all evolving and no one knows what virtual currency differences do and will mean in the long run and theydont want to screw this up.
And the wording of the IRS and The senate oversight committee press releases and the coinbase settlement all seem to indicate i am right and they exclude swapping one virtual currency denomination for another as a stated taxable event. We must assume if they wanted to say it was they would have specifically said it was.
Remember the Irs does treat " virtual currency" differently. "virtual currency" is literally the irs new definition and hasnt ever existed before and is recognized as differen than anything else. . Its not the same as stocks or gold. They create whole new guidance for "virtual currency" becuase they recognized it has unique characteristics.
And if you trade say bitcoin for ethereum on say poloniex you NEVER cashed to fiat because poloniex specifically doesnt allow that...probably SPECIFICALLY NOT to trigger IRS fiat capital gains reporitng requirements because poloniex is a US registered financial institution and know the trouble points afterprobably having extensive discussions with their lawyers because they are a New York registed company.
Remember while the irs guidance says if you trade virtual curency for OTHER PROPERTY or for a SERVICE or if you are PAID in virtual currency  for your services then you owe capital gains or personal income tax as properly calculated.
However in all those statements in the guidance vand senate press release and coinbase settlement) it specifically DOES NOT SAY if you trade VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY it is a taxable event.   
They specifically listed all the OTHER things as taxable events. Since they didnt list virtual currnecy traded for virtual currency  that then we get to assume they DIDNT MEAN IT WAS A TAXABLE EVENT.
You dont get to say "oh thats what they MEANT to say"
No. If they mean  to say it we get to assume they WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WHICH THEY DIDNT.
Again look at the entirety of the guidance   
So you have to back up something when you go beyond guidance and beyond law and create your own rule.
I'm Not being a jerk.
I just need to see the law or guidance you are quoting for your source.
Remember the IRS guindance says only that "virtual currency" is a single category of property. It does NOT say different virtual currencies are different properties or types of properties. That is NOT  distinction the IRS has made. 
It does NOT distishguish between different virtual currencies as DIFFERENT  property. So far there is no ruling that says that (that I am aware of.)  
As far as the IRS is concerned they could be thinking that switching from one virtual currency to another is not selling anything. To them it could be like painting your boat a different color. In fact I wouod argue it IS just like painting your boat a different color EVEN if painting it makes it worth more or less value. Its still the same property.  Remember virtual currency is not divisble physical things. Thats why the IRS had to write special guidance in the first place.
Also remember you need to follow guidance and law as written. If it doenst say it you dont assume they meant to say it. You dont make up your own added language.
You file and pay based on actual written law and guidance.
The guidance does NOT say trading only virtual currency is the same as selling and buying other property or even trading other property.
The IRS  DOES saying selling virtual currency for fiat IS a taxable event though.
If the IRS WANTED  to say trading one virtual currency for another is taxable they would have actually said that in the next sentence. They didnt. You dont get to add a missing sentence they didnt write.
*********For further evidencesee tue senate committee notice after the irs guidance was issued.
Notice what they say is taxable and notice they do NOT list "trading virtual cureency"   as taxable  
Hell they specifically say it has some characteristics of currency as legal tender but theydont recognize say bitcoin as different than ethereum any more than they say 10 dollars as ten 1 dollar bills is different than a ten dollar bill and call for taxing that swap.
*******As further evidence  swapping different virtual cureencies has not been ruked taxable i give you Coinbase's settlement with the IRS who wanted Coinbase to give them all usrrs names and coinbase protested saying irs rukes dont apply to their customers and HERE IS WHATTHEY SETTLED ON.
reporting ONLY pekple who received at least $20,000 in CASH for virtual cureency




Source   
NOT people who traded virtual currencies for other virtual currencies no matter how much they traded. NOT users who withdrew virtual currencies.
Thats a very important point.
And remember that was after coinbase and the IRS had some intense negotiation and thatis whatthey both agreed was relevant for the IRS. So that has meaning.
I suggest that the proper wayto think about how the IRS thinks about virtual currency is that swapping some ethereum for some bitcoin etc is like swapping a ten dollar bill for ten one dollar bills and is not a taxable event. I feel that way becuase all the guidance and senate ststements and their settlement with coinbase all seem to indicate that and excludes swapping  name of virtual cureency for another denomination of virtual currency.  
Of course tommorrow they might change their mind and issue new guidance and the congress who actually makes the laws might agree or disagree. Only congress makes the law on this no matter whattue guidance.
But i dont think it is congresses intent to stifle trading cryptocurrencies with taxes now. I think they want to minimize thst. I think they arecorrect and ots the coreect way to look atit and all the written guidance so far and the coinbasesettlement seems to not contradict me.
(i am not an attoney or tax professional. This is my personal opinion. Many people over pay their taxesevery year. Correctly and legally avoiding taxation that doesnt exist is not illegal and is not evasion. Pay your correct taxes. Dont lie and conceal. This is all a new world. Many rules arent written yet. But never does the court or congress require or intend to require anyone to pay a tax on something that the congress has not said they must pay a tax on)
What does all this mean? it means i am personally comfortable defending in an audit the position that trading different names of virtual currency is NOT a taxable event and I feel comfortable pointing out the evidence in the IRS guidance and senate statements and Coinbase settlement thatdefend tuat position. Of course the IRS could say i misinterpreted and might even fine me a penaltly for late payment of something if they thought i was wrong. (its rare they give you a penatly if there was an honest legitimate different interpretation of unclear matters. )  But that isnt criminal and no different than any other tax filling and certainly better than paying taxes you dont actually owe.  and I am not a tax protest nor would i hide anything or misrepresent anything to the IRS. And I am NOT saying anyone else should.  But nothing i have seen in guidance or senate statements or the coinbase settlement on reporting gives me any reason to think that trading virtual currency denominations is a reportable or taxable event. In fact it all points to the opposite conclusion.
Someone show me a better argument?
Now maybe tomorrow they will all send out different guidiance or have a different court ruling or law from congress but we dont pay taxes for taxes that dont exist yet but one day might exist in the future.

Ypu resd it.
It never says trsding crypto for crypto is taxaboe.
It lists many other cases that specifically are taxable.
It never ever says trading one crypto for another is taxable.
Thats probably becuase they dont view one crypto as different properrtyfrom another becuase ...lets face it.. they arent. Cryptos are unique in tue world. They dont represent anything physical or even ownership of anything physical unlike a stock.  And there is no specifif definitio  of what make sone crypto different from another or if they really are different in any substantial enough way to even qualify as a trsdeof property...if thry were physical property...which they srent.

Except you arent trading diffrent property.
You are repainting the same xproperty". The irs defined virtual currency as property. They didnt define different cryptocureencies or swapping one currency for another as swapping property though. You are puttiing those words into tueir guidlines when the IRS and the Senate and the Coinbase settlement all SPECIFICALLY AVOIDED SAYING THAT when they specifically mention every other taxable event.
Do you think the IRS just forgot to mention a major taxable event ? Do you think they just forgetto think about trading evne though they know it going on and specifcally had those types of dicussions?
Of course not.
So since they didnt say it was a taxable event we have to assume they  didnt mean to imply it.
And very CERTAINLY the congress has NOT said it it and the congress has had many many specific hesrings on it.
If they wanted trading cryptos to be taxable they would clearly write  "the trader of crypto for crypto will pay taxes basedon the value at the time of exchange" just like they did for those otherspecific instances they DID say were taxable..such as trading crpyto for services.
 But they havent.
So it isnt.
Because people dont just get to make up their own taxes.
But hey...you go ahead and pay a 15% cap gain on your swaps even though there is no ruling guideline or law that says you have to.
While you are at it why not pay an air tax?  The IRS has not specifically said you can consume and expell and trade air tax free and you say you have to pay taxes on the value of other assets you acquire and get rid of so pay a tax on the air value.
If you are making up taxes you might as well make that one up and pay it too.
Get yourslef a good tax attorney who knows how to argue a interpetation with the IRS.

Actually it is exactly like thst.
Of you understood the software code you woukd know tuis.
The reason its different from your stock trading account is that stock repsents a portion of ownership of physical assets f a company.
A bitcoin represents nothing except a location number and numerical value  in a blockchain position. Literally.
This is why thegovernnent and irs are having such a hardtime knowing whatto do with it.
Thus far they havent said moving numbers  around on ledgers is taxable.  They have said if you trade for something not on a blockchain ledger then you owe tax.
Sorry no time for tue rest.
See my other posts for my opinions.
In short though bitcoin and all crypto is exactly like a giant shared verifiable spreadshet full of entries which every agrees on. Thats exactly like what bitcoin and all cryptos are. And the irs has never taxed copying or moving   cells in a spreadsheetis taxable.

Afford it means you dont go into debt and you wont need the money in the next year. Dont go spending money you need in two weeks hoping it will go up and you can sell then and get your money back.
On average bitcoin has gone up. If it continues then it makes sense to have bought sooner rather than later. But it sometimes goes down from a peak and stays down for years before it goes up again.
Look carefully at this chart. Yes it has gone up. But also notice carefully thatit also goes down ad stays down for long periods of time..years... before going up to new highs.

If it doesgo to 4300 hundred in 2 days it might mean  the public interest is already parabolic again and therefore peaking so we might have another crash before $10,000. If the risehappens slower then i think we make 10,000 in this boom cycle.

If there are  21 million and 7 billion peopme then only1 in 333 people can own a whole bitcoin. That 1/3 higher than the top 1%  of people.
And there arent going to be 21 million free bitcoins in circulation because of burned coins and holders with thousands.

Cryptocurrency has always been treated differently.

It may get to that point but until they explicitly say it HAS then you assume it hasnt.

This goes back to the point about bitcoin that people forget.
It has a depth of investment much greater than any other coin.
Marketcap is interesting but that is dependent completely on the last trade and not indicative of the total amount invested by a lot of people over time.
Bitcoin has that depth in both actual physical monetary investment as purchases over years as well as equipment and electricity purchases for mining over years and years and for that reason it has much more traction.  It simple doesnt really crash becuase it has a floor of owners who have owned for a long time and dont ever and will never sell.
And for every slump there will be a huge group that see it as a new buying opportunity.
Also Bitcoin will never go to zero. Thats because Bitcoin is not a lottery ticket. Its worth does not expire after a given time period. It will always have its primary characteristics of scarcity and transferability across national lines forever and those characterisitixs will ALWAYS have value.
Furthermore it is so young in its life and so new that it hasnt begun to approach its investment allocation levels in the regular investment marketplace. Even if it only rises to a fringe allocation  commodity like gold which very few people actually own it still has more than 20 x its current marketcap to go  putting it over $300,000 and thats just if it equalls the number of fringe end of the worlders who hold physical gold as a hedge against calamity. How many people like thst do you know?  Bitcoin will easily exceed that.
At this point bitcoin as only JUST become known to the investment community as a real investment allocation. Before literally this year it was only quoted along with mentions of criminal behavior and the dark web. Have you noticed none of the recent coverage said that anymore?
Bitcoin has only just entered the investment world stage.
There is no better alternative investment.

It hit 10 k around midnight last night and there was a brief pullback in the early early morning night before firmly holding at 10 k all morning and day today.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:52:55
Yeah that last drop and lull was the longest.
It occurred at the peak time of regular person awareness so had a lot of new money behind it that panicked and took a long time to figure out they made a mistake in panicking. (most bought back in much higher.)
Now we are seeing the beginnings of wide recognition and awareness by professional money managers who are investing other peoples money and are more blaise about normal ups and downs (and hopefully dont over extend themselves like regular people tend to do) so if it stumbles temporarily the recovery will be less and faster.
However the huge amounts of new professional fund money coming in may so swamp the market with buying pressure that we could see prices reach  gold marketcap levels ($300,000 per coin)  at much faster speedsthan in the past.
It seems the pros are finally sold on the value of bitcoin.  So the pricing curve may exponenential increase beyond the prior exponential increases. Suddenly we are talking about the availability of billions of new investment whereas before it was just millions. And the total new investment pool could be a reasonable part of the several trillion dollar hedge fund assets.

Well we already hit 10k last night and this morning based on which exchange.
Coinmarketcap.com showed it on their metrics at around midnight last night then a dip for a few hours and steady above 10k all day since about 6am.  
Honestly with all the new hedgefund money coming in the scared home investor no longer runs the emotional dips that come after milestones.
They still happen but dont last long.
There are so many pros waiting in the in the wings HOPING to BUY on the expected dip that the dips dont last.
I think we had the dip last night. I think that was it.
We are racing to $100,000 now.
And I do mean racing. Everyone expects it and major fund managers are trying to gettheir buys in at as low a price point as they can and they have a LOT of money they must invest before then or their investorsill be PISSED. They can't really wait around for temporary dips.
When you are in the Indy 500 you dont pull over at mile 10 to see if everyone else is going to slow down.
Edit: I don't think there is a bitcoin investor left in the world that doesnt think bitcoin is going to AT LEAST challenge gold and gold's marketcap  and that means a price of $330,000 per bitcoin. And that is really sort of a minimum rational estimate of bitcoins utility and store of value worth in the worlds wealth system. Many many people think bitcoin will far exceed the marketcap value of gold because after all gold is a difficult and rather extremisst thing to own so few people do and bitcoin is likely to be much more mainstream with more wide spread adoption.
 Add up the market value of all currencies in the world for example and think of bitcoin as an alternative. 
Then add up the marketvalue of all asset wealth in the world and think of bitcoin as a marker of asset holdings and exchange and you get to numbers that dwarf gold market caps and prices of $330,000.
Bitcoin isnt a product or a currency or a corporation so comparisions are silly.
Bitcoin is a world wealth system. It is the world marker of value itself. That ultimately will link it to the value of all the world assets combined.

We will see the same types of runups we saw from the individual basement investor money for the past 4 years. But the new starting point for the big money was at about $1000 or $4000  so just scale everything up from there .
And realize professional money doesnt get scared and stay down for the same lengths of time so the peaks should come much faster. Professional money osnt someones rent money. Its other peoples money and the profession managers dont spook at short term losses so they dont get scared and divest with a drop.
$100,000 by Jan 2019 wouldnt surprise me either. There will be a huge deluge of money now from sources so large as to make the sum total of previous investment seem an anthill. Trillions and trillions of new wealth will be created.

Not really. Not if they arent your monthly living funds but actual set aside investments.
Its got a very likely bottom of half wifh a nearly 100 % chance of full recovery in 18 months by that time based on many years track record.  That makes it a pretty risk free investment for the 2 or  3 year term.  Add to that the fundemental dynamic of knowing there is far more money scheduled to enter the market from wallstreet and the upward pricing pressure is nearly guaranteed.

We'll be at $10,000 in three weeks is my guess now. The big big money handlers in New York have now finally seen the light. By the time they finish getting in we will be at $100,000 easy is my guess.
I am guessing all the new bitcoin wallstreet funds have a target to getinvested within 6 months.
The pricing pressure will be enormous. I dont even know where they will find the supply to buy with all the tiny transfer restrictions on the exchanges.
Remember literally the heads  of the 10 new wallstreet hegdefunds  wrote their prospectuses when bitcoin was $600 and they have to be fully invested or explain why they arent at the end of next year.
I dont think much of the last run up was man on street buying.
I think it was wall street size funds.

I do remember running to buy when i first really read about it and studied it.  Literally thinking it was going to $100,000 next week . Best decision i ever made.

I think we are on a faster path now that professional funds are officially set up to invest.
10 new hedge funds this year vs 2 last year.
Those professionals know to make the big gains they must race to get in as fast as possible.
All of them know in 6 months their invesotrs will be saying "why didnt you get all in sooner when it was at a lower price?"
Its a lot more money moving a lot quicker than the past years of mostly uncertain people on the street investing their own money.
I think its also why we dont have the longer periods of down turn anymore.

You must be relatively new to bticoin.
This is the whole history of bitcoin since its creation.
Its been adopted as a store of wealth .
It has not been significantly adopted as a purchasing currency which doesnt and hasnt changed its real value as store of wealth.
What that means to me is that lots of people are purchasing, holding, and doing nothing else.


Again the same argument has been made for years and neglects one thing.
What else would someone put it in?
Yes some are hedging their bets with some allocation to some other alts and maybe some are buying some things for their lives as they need to but no one is cashing out completely and they likely never will because anyone in bitcoin knows its a long term hold and safer store of wealth than banks, national currencies etc and easier to hold and transfer than gold.

This shows a fundemental misunderstanding of bitcoin.
Bitcoin isnt a bet that will lose all value if it doenst hit 10 x. Bitcoin is something huge amounts pf people have decided is a good place to store some part of their wealth. It will remain that way for decades even if it suffers a slow decline. This gives it a level of safety that a bet in vegas doesnt have.
Bitcoin is unique however in that there are many fundentmental reasons for it to have a huge payoff possibility that most normal investments dont have. 
So it has the possible payoff of a lottery ticket yet almost no possibility of going to zero.

Yeah i have some monero ethereum and eos and veritiseum and some others maidsafe groestlecoin and some penny coins like mooncoin and catcoin etc. Got them early. And i always keep all the forked coins just because you cover the possibility that one might do something crazy good.
They are so cheap you can buy the same number as you have have bitcoin for  almost nothing and if they ever really go crazy then ..wow.
But the thing is the bitcoin has just blown them out of the water in appreciation. They are now a minor part of my portfolio. And i could have had a third more bitcoin... But i am ok with that trade just  as a hedge against something crazy .  
But it does reinforce the adage that the only bad thing to do with bitcoin over the long term is to sell it.
But I would never ever be all the way out of bitcoin.
I play with 5% of my cryptocoin value with other new coins on the possibility that i might get the 10,000 / 1 return that I missed by not getting into bitcoin as early as most here. (i still think i will eventually get the 10,000 / 1 return on bitcoin in the end.)
I personally think there is real possibilty for huge returns on the old penny meme coins like catcoin and mooncoin which you can buy by the sackfull (thousands) for $1 and people are suddenly looking at them again.

Well we already hit 10k last night and this morning based on which exchange.
Coinmarketcap.com showed it on their metrics.
Honestly with all the new hedgefund money coming in the scared home investor no longer runs the emotional dips that come after milestones.
They still happen but dont last long.
There are so many pros waiting in the in the wings HOPING to BUY on the expected dip that the dips dont last.
I think we had the dip last night. I think that was it.
We are racing to $100,000 now.
And I do mean racing. Everyone expects it and major fund managers are trying to gettheir buys in at as low a price point as they can and they have a LOT of money they must invest before then or their investorsill be PISSED. They can't really wait around for temporary dips.
When you are in the Indy 500 you dont pull over at mile 10 to see if everyone else is going to slow down.
Edit: I don't think there is a bitcoin investor left in the world that doesnt think bitcoin is going to AT LEAST challenge gold and gold's marketcap  and that means a price of $330,000 per bitcoin. And that is really sort of a minimum rational estimate of bitcoins utility and store of value worth in the worlds wealth system. Many many people think bitcoin will far exceed the marketcap value of gold because after all gold is a difficult and rather extremisst thing to own so few people do and bitcoin is likely to be much more mainstream with more wide spread adoption.
 Add up the market value of all currencies in the world for example and think of bitcoin as an alternative. Add up the marketvalie of all asset wealth in the world and think of bitcoin as a marker of asset holdings and exchange and you get to numbers that dwarf gold market caps and prices of $330,000.

NBC just did one of the best stories on Bitcoin I have ever seen mainstream media do. Excellent explanation. Mentioned the drop but also pointed out its sustained growth dispute that drop.
The only criticism I have came from two bad quotes from a guy with the Digital Currency Group.
He said "bitcoin is an investment" . That's wrong. It's a protocol.
He also said " you will either make a lot of money or you will lose all your money" . That's completely wrong.  Bitcoin will never be worth nothing, anymore than an ounce of gold will ever be worth nothing. People need to stop saying that. It's false and people in the industry especially should know better.

If i was a powerful CPA in New York City attempting to maximise tax savings for my large networth clients legally then I would adopt my personal opinion as a very logical position. Its a lot better and more defensible than many many tax positions that have been adopted  by large high proceed CPA firms for large clients.
In my opinion.
Of course in any case the IRS can disagree  with your tax interpretation in an audit.
But that isnt criminal.
They might just say you owe some tax you didnt think you owed but tue other guy says you should pay. 
If its enough money you might even want to take it to tax court to get a judges opinion.
That happens every day in amerixa and often the IRS is ruled wrong and sometimes they arent.
Bit it isnt criminal.

This part is genius:
Begin quote
So depending on what you mean by blockchain, there is this power struggle happening and this power struggle is if you like the fundamental human weakness which is the desire to have a hierarchy, the desire to elect rulers to appeal to authority, to look for leaders.
Bitcoin introduces this environment in which there are no leaders, there are rules without rulers. And of course, some of us look at that and say
“Great! This could revolutionize human society!”
but most people look at that and go,
“Let’s elect a leader!”
They instinctively want to find someone to trust and to make the authority which runs counter to the whole thing. So from the very early days of this technology, just like from the very early days of the internet people tried to centralize, control and tame this open and slightly chaotic architecture.
We think that’s where the power struggle comes.
End quote
Of course the real struggle is that some say
"i want to continue to be that leader so I get more than everyone else"

There is absolutely no reason to beleive this. all guidance, the congressional oversight committee review and letter in response to tue irs guidance and the settlement with coinbase all fail to mention this as taxable while specifically mention every other taxable instances.
Coins do NOT exist.
When you are switching coins you are not trading anything. You are simply switching blockchain protocols. There are no coins. Coins dont exist. Bitcoin is a software protocol period and other softwareprotocols are similiar named "coins" simply to make a explaination simplier to the uneducated public. They are not separate property. The irs has never broken down separate blockchain protocols as separate property. They lump all protocols together as one property known as "virtual currency" in their guidance.
By advising people to file as if they are trading separate property you are commiting them to a consistent filing method that they would need to follow forever in absence of specific guidance that it is taxable from the IRS.
In my opinion this is a huge and extremely costly tax current and future tax mistake.

Of course i know capital gains taxes are a small percentage.
I dont owe any.
I pay any taxes i owe.
Paying a 15% cash rate on protocol switches would necessitate a cash out as well as loss of likely far greater gains in the future.
The amount is irrelevent. 
The only question is has the irs or congress stated that capital gains events happen when swapping protocols of virtual currencies. They have not explicitly or implicitly said that.
People are extrapolating on what was said to create a non existent idea that the IRS "meant" to ssy thst.
When you go to pay your taxes do you  pay taxes on things the IRS didnt say you must pay taxes on?no of course not. Is it wrong if you dont? No. Of course not.

The guidance from the IRS lumped all crypto currency together underone heading as "virtual currency" as property and discussed several instances of trading work for virtual currency or for other property as taxable.
Noteably the irs guidlines made no mentions of various different protocols or protocol subsets (ie different "coins") as being considered separate property or as switching between protocols ("trading"  "coins") as a taxable event.
Additionally the congressional oversight committee responded to the specific guidlines positively and also listed the taxable events in their own letter ...none of which including switching protocols ("trading" "coins") as taxable.
In a settlement with Coinbase on reporting the IRS reached a settlement requiring Coinbase to only report to the IRS customers who traded virtual currency for cash ...NOT those customers who only were switching protocols ("trading" "coins").
In all of these instances multiple IRS lawyers and experts on the blockchain programming protocols many of whom testified extensively for years before congress in hearings came to the conclusion that switching protocols ("trading" "coins") was NOT to be mentioned as a taxable event in their written guidance while most other possible hypothetical instances  such as trading virtual currency for work or cash WERE listed as taxable. No doubt the guidance letter, the congressionial oversight committee letter and Coinbase settlement all went through numerous revisions and doublechecking before issuance. Yet NONE of them mention that circumstance so I think its fair to assume they meant to exclude it.
Do you beleive all those IRS lawayers and computer experts were simply stupid and FORGOT to mention that switching protocols ... a hugely common activity occuring all around the world in multiple multibillion dollar regulated exchanges.. ("trading" "coins") is taxable or do you beleive they were competent and knew that switching protocols like copying data from one (spreadsheet cell to another) was actually not a taxable event?
What is your specific knowledge of the programming of a blockchain, the protocols, the degree of separation of protocols, the forking of protocols all leading to some very different protocols and some barely different protocols and some protocols that are exaclty the same but existing on different chains? What about sub protocols or chains under other chains like tokens under ethprotocol? If you beleive switching protocols is taxable at what point do you say one protocol starts and stops? What about protocols that are involuntarily switched for everyone by the core programmers such as when bitcoin goes through a hard fork? Should all bitcoin participants pay a tax on that protocol switch?
Shouldnt we  instead beleive  the irs and congress and all their lawyers and experts got it right and did NOT say switching protocls ("trading" "coins") wasa taxaboe event because they knew there was actually no way to make that distinction or split those hairs and switching protocols was likely no more a taxable event than painting a blue truck white? 
I have to say i beleive you and other cpas telling people to list switching protocols ("trading" "coins") as taxable events are making a HUGE COSTLY mistake.
You are making tax law that does not exist and expanding a very carefully worded IRS guidance beyond what the guidance says.
I personally plan to follow the irs guidance to the letter.
Specifically i will calculate taxes on trading of virtual currency for other property like cash or work. I will NOT list switching protocols ("trading" "coins") as a taxable or reportable event because the irs guidance doesnt say it is. 
If i am audited i will simply show them the written guidance, the oversight committee letter and coinbasereporting requirements non of which mention switching protocols ("trading" "coins"b as a taxable or reportable event. I will be consistent this year as last year when I also did not report taxes i dont owe or dont exist. Year on year consistency is important in an audit.
I will not create and pay new taxes where none exist.
I am not a tax advisor or cpa. This is not tax advise for you or anyone else.
I am a former computer programmer with more than a laymans understanding of what blockchains and distributed ledger systems are and how to program them and how switching protocols is far more like copying data from one spreadsheet to another than buying and selling property.
However selling your statuson a protocol for cash or labor is very different and is probably why those are mentioned as taxable in the guidance while switching protocols ("trading" "coins") is NOT listed as taxable.
If the irs or congress makes new guidance or laws declaring the switching of blockchain protocols ("trading" "coins" ) as taxable then of course I will pay taxes on those actions. However no guidance from the IRS letters or new laws from congress have created such a tax to my knowledge.
If any CPA tells you you need to pay capitalsgains when "trading coins" please ask them where those coins are? What colors are they? How big and how heavy are they? Where are they stored?  Ask them whatthey know about blockchain protocols and how they differ and how they are similiar. For example ask them how bitcoin changed after the first hardfork and ask them if that made the little gold coins in tue pictures become different or not?  Ask them if you should pay capital gains on an old blue truck if you paint it white and if not why you need to do it on crypto protocol changes. 
If I do have a taxable event as listed under the guidance i will simply list it as the "sale of virtual currency" not breaking it down into various sub protocol names suchs Bitcoin or others.
(Lastly as a side I want to remind everyone that until congress specifically makes a tax thatit doesnt exist. Blockchains are an actual new invention on earth and have never existed before and thus no taxes have ever specifically been written for them by congress to my knowledge. Even the guidance by the IRS in fact is attempting to shoehorn apply a tax to something that it wasnt ever written for. I am not a hard liner on this but many people could have a good argument that even a sale of virtual currency for cash is not taxable becuase no such law was every written by congress for virtual currency. I dont take that position but i would sympathize with anyone who would and hope someone actually does test that in court. As for me I plan to follow the guidance to the letter but not exceed it and pay a tax on work or cash or physical property traded for virtual currency but not on things they dont say are taxable like switching protocols ("trading" "coins")
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:00:31
They dont say exchanging of virtual currency for other virtual currencydo they?
So if you assume they mean that then you are assuming something not in evidence arent you? You are assuming tuat high level irs lawyers left out some words that change the mea ing of their phrase.
And it also isnt said in the congressional oversight report and the coinbase reporting requirment negotiated with the irs does not require them to report customers who only exchange crypto for crypto. Only those exchanging crypto for fiat.  If the irs thinks exchanging crypto for crypto is just as taxable as exchanging crypto for fiat then the reporting requirements that coinbase must make to the irs woud also include those exchanging crypto for crypto. Right?

Yes but it doesnt say WHAT they exchange them for.
The negotiated resolution of the  coinbase case proves they are not refering to "exchange" of virtual currency for "another virtual currency".
Thats because they settled with coinbase by requiring coinbase only report customers who have exchanged crypto for fiat.
They are not required to report customers who only exchanged crypto for crypto va protocol switch in technical terms)

Now what if that number 100 actually isnt tied to anything and you do the ssme thing? no. Congratulations. You just switched blockchain protocols. Do you think the IRS thinks that cut and paste should be taxable? 
Now what of someone pays you $10 in US dollars for you to send them the password to that spresdsheet so they can open it play with that cell and you no longer can? Is that taxable? the irs says yes. And that makes sense. You no longer control the protocol and they do.

In absence of the IRS OR congress explicitly informing me in a clear manner with new clear legislation or explicitclesr unambigious guidance that there is a tax on that situation , i dont see how we can be expected to pay one . I am quite happy to make that argument in any future audit. I am not a protestor. I pay what I owe happily. But it needs to be a real tax and not one someone is speculating exists without explicit clear proof.
It sure beats paying a tax just becuase you are afraid you might have to pay it in fhe future if you dont now. Thsts sort of silly. And yes there arepossible penalties but its pretty hard for the irs to make a case for penalties when there is no legislation or explicit guidance saying the tax is owed.
(and if you have to argue whether the guidance means that then it isnt explcit)

There are no experts in this area because its all new.
We are all reading the same guidance in the same english.
I may and I think I probably do have more undersanding of what a blockchain protocol is and what it actually represents and why probably the IRS very wisely did NOT decide to state that swapping protocols ("trading" "coins") is a taxable event.
I beleive many cpa's think that there are things thst are actually like coins somewhere and tuat a blockchian ledger represents ownership of them. There arent and it doesnt.  Its a hard thing to wrap your head around  but thatmay be precisely WHY the IRS did NOT specifically state it was included as a taxable event in their guidance.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:10:57
1.The irs guidaince does NOT say you have a taxable event when "exchanging virtual currencies for virtual currencies". It also does not give an example of such a case which it surely wojkd if thatis what it meant.
People who claim it does are extrapolating languagebeyond what is stated and not reading carefully and imagining that little coins are real.
Remember coins dont exist. 
Changing from bitcoin to another coin is not exchanging anything. It is switching computer protocols.

There is a huge amount of wall street money being allocated this year for crypto. They know the long term ultimate value proposition for bitcoin is way above the marketcap of gold which puts the bitcoin price floor long term at $330,000 or $1,000,000. 
Remember right this minute millions of new dollars are pouring into bitcoin just like every single day.
The price right now is simply being affected by the few stupid people who borrowed to buy and now have to sell. Once those are flushed out the price will  recover.
If you look at the order books you can tell by the slope of the ask and offer curves that far more people are interested in buying than selling at this and any price point near this.
For that reason I think this slump will not last long... Weeks or months at most is my guess. 
Here is the fact. If you look at the multi year historical bitcoin price graph  past pullbacks after publicity peaks have ended you can pick those points as the absolute best times to buy bitcoin to really change your life. Anyone who is smart is taking advantage of the lower prices to buy what they can now and I think those wall street funds really recognize that so this slump wont last long.

Only in the context of exchanging virtual currency for othertyps of assests and using those other types of assets to determine if the exchange is a capital gain or not. Specififally they mention goods and service for retail sale (such as overstock.com selling retail inventory goods for bitcoin) that arent capital assets or other property that is a capital asset.
I dont have time to go through more.
However again... If the irs is going into such things asselling retail goods for bitcoin and they want to tax bitcoin /eth protocol swaps then why dont they have a paragraph about "if you exchange 10 eth for 1 bitcoin that you held for more than a year then you woukd be taxed at capital gains rates"? If the irs  meant to imply that then they would state that example. They dont. Therefore we must conclude that the irs lawyers working on the guidance were intelligent and meant not to imply or claim that.
Do you really think they fail to mention that case specifically  when if they meant that? it would be perhaps the largest part of the capital gains received beciasei think many people swap more than they cash out (thats jist a guess). Tjey wpukd certainly know it. Therefore it wpuod make no sense to issue guidance and not specifically mentio  it anywuere.
And again neither does the congressional oversight letter .
And neither does the coinbase reporting requirement require reporting of those who only exchange but do not cash out.

For example the exchange of breathable air between individuals. There are many other exchangesof value tuat hapoen every day that are not taxable.

They never said anything like this
"if I utilize a cross blockchain interchange to swap bitcoin protocol for ethereum protocol do I owe taxes?" 
Now you want me to beleive that you know they MEANT to say that and just forgot despite spending months on tue guidance and no doubt having several authors looking at the guidance. You think they failed to provide an example of one of the most common actions despite listing many other examples but they meant to.  
On the other hand I beleive they didnt include it because they didnt mean to include it becuase they understood switching your preferred protocols is not really a transaction.
Now either the irs lawyers are smart and careful and agree with me, or they agree with you but are stupid and forgot to include what would have been one of the most important examples if they meant it.
And the congressional oversight committee was also stupid and forgot in their response letter.
And the irs forget it again in reporting requirements for Coinbase.
Now which position makes more sense: They and the congressional oversight committee were smart and excluded that case or they were stupid and forget it and you are psychic and know what they really meant even when they didnt say it in three different documents with multiple other stated examples?

It has nothing to do with coming to any conclusions.
Remember it is up to congress to create laws and the irs to actually write down their opinion of what is taxable.
What i am doing is AVOIDING coming to conclusions for the IRS.
Everyone else is assuming or concluding things that are not written.
We cant be expected to write opinions for them or create taxes that they specifically dont  state or create.

The exchsnge or sale


Not " the exchange or sale of virtual currencies for other virtual currencies of a diffferent protocol"
Additonally not all crypto protocols are convertible. Who is going to make that determination? Snd some arent convertible and later become convertible. Then  what?
Anyway if they mesnt to say the exchange of one virtual currency for another is a taxable event the  they wouod day it clealry. And the congressional oversight letter wouod say it. And the coinbase reproting requirements wouldnt just require reporting only those who exchanged crypto for fiat. But all those cases are wahtthey are and none are consistent or exhibit a ststement from the irs of congress thattheintentis to make exchanging one crypto protocol for another taxble.
Remember there are three documents that we can look t if you doubt the obvious exclusion of the mention of exchanging crypto for crypto in the guideline.

I appreciate your analysis but you make subtle expansion in every statement building to a large expansion.  None are what the IRS say.
Here is the thing.
Its really simple.
If the irs wanted people to pay capital gains on the exchange of virtual currencies FOR EACH OTHER they simply would have said exactly that.
They did not. 
They said everything EXCEPT that.
We MUST sssume the IRS meant what theysaid and not what they didnt say.
Its that simple.
If we had to go around and assume the IRS meant things were taxable events that they didnt say were taxable events do you realize how impossible and rediculous that would be? 
The luck is we dont have to do that.
And remember the IRS negotiated settlement for reporting from Coinbase goes against what you say and is illogical if taxing crypto to crypto is their position. Also the congression oversight committee letter also did not say crypto to crypto was taxable. So thats two other documents that dont match the idea that the irs was claiming crypto protocol changes ("trading" "coins") were taxable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:35:01
Its not an asset swap whe  you are switching protocols.
For example is the number 100 different if i wrote it as 100.000 ?  should i be taxed if i change the way I write that number?  That is all you are doing when switching crypto protocols.  
The irs wisely has apparently agreed that shoukd not be taxable OR THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IT WAS IN THEIR GUIDANCE.  Likely they didnt because tjey realized from their resesrch it would be wrong.

Transactions using virtual currency is not the same as switching the protocols you prefer for virtual currency. Switching 10 $10 dollar bills to one 100 dollar bill is not the same as having a $100 dollar transaction to buy a boat.
Your answer represents a fundemental misunderstanding of what a blockchain protocol is and more importantly what it is not.
Coins dont actually exist. Therefore different coins dont actually exist. There areonly aligned, forked, separated, recombined and derivative protocols and subprotocols. Switching protocols is not a transaction or something listed as taxable in those guidelines. Read them carefully.
You are extrapolating a personal position based on something not said by the IRS.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:12:43
No. The IRS doesnt say that.
This is widely proliferating totally made up nonsense based on absolutely nothing but conjecture.
Prove what you say.
The IRS guidance never says switching one blockchain protocol for another is a taxable event.
They only say trading virtual currency for work or cash etc is taxable in their examples.
Do you think their lawyers and experts simply FORGOT to mention it if they meant it? Doou really think if issuing guidance they would FORGOT to mention one of the most common things in the virtual currency world of they meant it?

Stocks represent a physical ownership of control of a legal entity.
Real companies are required to own at least the minimum cash infusion to incorporate the company.
That is not an essential requirement of any of the early blockchain protocols (ICOCs are something different and even more confusing.)
When you own crypto you dont actually own anything.
You control the password to control the transference of a number that is unassociated with any guarantee of anything. The number does not represent any assigned meaning other than being originally derived or transferred from a result of a group search for a solution to a mathematical problem.

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:44:44
There are two factors involved in pricing with bitcoin. They have been the same throughout bitcoin history and have nothing to do with scaling or use as a currency.
1. One is the genuine education and realization by more people everyday that bitcoin is real and not a scam and has real value because of its scarcity and transmissibility.
2. The second is the purchasing surges that come from new money coming into bitcoin as media attention period often driven by price rises cause more people to buy more in surges.
The pattern has repeated as long as anyone can look back over bitcoins history. It happened when it became worth one penny, 10 cents, $1, $10,$100,1000  etc etc.
Its tough to know how much of any given price rise is driven by number one vs number 2.
However it doesnt matter because we are way below the fundemental  valuation of bitcoin. Bitcoin hasnt even reached 1/10 th the cap rate of gold. 
And Gold is a fringe, clumsy and unwieldy investmentof survivalists. 
When bitcoin has the marketcap of just that fringe investment every bitcoin will be worth $330,000 or so.
The way forward is always the same. After a price escallation there is a pullback. When the public and media realize that once again bitcoin survives and the returns have been far better than virtually any other type of investment then they start buying again, the price recovers and exceeds its previous proce, the media picks it up, more people become edicated about its real value from the media, more rush to buy and the cycle continues again  often at 10x its previous price.
People like to quote peaks in proce agaisnt falls but remember those peaks usually were isolated and for short times like the pressure on your back when people are trying to stuff an elevator when they fear the doors are closing. . A 30 day price average is usually a more telling representation of the publics education level about bitcoins worth.
Historically the pullbacks have been the last best times to buy bitcoin and people who buy during those periods are the ones that have seen their stake 10x and 100 x in a year.
If you want to get an estimate about number 2 looking at the bitcoin elvis index on  is a good place to start.

Or and by filing it that way you will be setting a precendent that you beleive that is what tue tax law says (when it doesnt) and you will have one hell of a time trying to change later.
Also the irs rarely imposes penalties on honest plausible interpretations of the tax laws that are deemed ambiguious.

Bitcoin is trying to replace the banking industry which is a huge Market. Most alt coins are trying to do specific small things which simply don't have that big a market. Additionally it's gotten extremely difficult for new people or anyone to sign up for exchanges and other things to purchase all the coins and in particular it's almost impossible for Americans to participate in ICO'S . All of this has caused alt coins to drop in my opinion. There's also just a general research fatigue. There are so many altcoins coming out claiming to do so many things it's almost impossible to become a expert on any one of them. And it's impossible to pick a time which is good to purchase it and pick it up before a dump phase.
Furthermore the claimed provements so many alts claim are marginal over bitcoin when it comes to the big markets which are store of value and portable gold 2.0  .

Things with truly limited supply must always increase in value over the long term in an inflationary world.
Furthermore during the initial adoption period when it is still being discovered  by mainstream investors it will undergo long term faster than average valuation acceleration.  Thats where Bitcoin is right now.
When every single investment advisor and big money fund is advocating and implementong having some allocation to bitcoin then we will know bitcoin is past the initial discovery phase. My personal belief is that at that point the marketcap of bitcoin should equal at least that of gold which has only a marginal allocation universiality among investment advisors. That gold market cap is around 7 Trillion equal to about $300,000 per bitcoin.

Forks are often involuntary. Sometimes people with a presence on one blockchain protocom suddenly have control over a presence controlled by a new forked protocol without their knowledgeor exicit acceptance.

The multi gear history of google bitcoin searches shows it is cyclic and preceeds price rises. Price rise and searches go hand in hand.
Its very similiar to interest in a particular stock as price starts to rise and talk coincides.

Its easier than storing gold ounces in a drawer and spending or moving those gold ounces yet gold ounces seem to be a pretty popular thing worth about 7 trillion in marketcap. (using gold isnt free either. Thereis always a commission spread fee)
When more people and governments continue to adopt bitcoin reserves like they do gold ounces and bitcoin marketcap equals 7 trillion too then each bitcoin will be worth over $300,000 .
Its pretty much inevitable.

What the ethereum split proved was that miners do not act on hypothetical theoretical loyality to a coin branch for some perceived greater good.
They mine what is profitable to mine with their equipment.

What you dont understand is by simply parking some of your wealth in bitcoin as a hedge against dollar collapse or banking seizures or tryrannical governments or speculative investment and doing nothing else you ARE using bitcoin.
You dont have to jbe using bitcoin to buy bubblegum to be using bitcoin. Same is true with a few ounces of gold.

Just like you use visa mastercard intermediaries for purchasing you also use shapeshift and others for purchasing anywhere with bitcoin.
You are using visa and master card electronic dots network and not cash in most things. Cash is very hard to use for any significant purchases.

Http://Www.Thebestbitcoinwebsite.com tracks it further back.
It was the firstplace i know of that publicly discussed this and it preceeded accurately the last price run up.
It also has an "elvis marker" that better indicates the growth of level of interest over time. Currently its alway over the elvis point which is a big change from last year. So interest isnt really down. The scale of this posted graph just makes it falsely appear to be down.

I would be interested to know how much of new investment is more corporate and institutional now. They track less with initial searches since they really load up more based on moving average price markers and based on their own investor pool inflows which track tax seasons and other things.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:21:24


Its not a challenge if the irs hasnt claimed it. 
Neither the irs not congress has ever claimed gains are to be calculated and taxes paid on pure crypto to crypto.  No example of that is given in the 2014 guidelines which surely would be the case if that is what they meant because an example of every other case  was given..wages.products etc.

@_date: 2018-04-04 08:39:45
I would just pay if they said some case law had been settled saying this interpretation was wrong. I would lilely appeal any harsh penalties since prior knowledge is so little at the time of fiking and the whole thing is admittedly vague even according to congress.
Id bring in a copy of the guidance with no example of crypto to crypto and a copy of letters from congress to the irs stating more guidance was needed at the time.
Its doubtful the auditing agent would assess penalites under the circumstances.
So worst case scenario i would pay some tax later that some speculative people think i should pay now.
So what?
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:47:19


You act like bitcoin was just stsrted yesterday. Look at the appreciation in value.


You spread wealth across different assets. 


Bitxoin is tremenedously undervalued right now. Even just at marketcap of gold its should be worth $300,000 per cpin.  Its not volatile over a yearly average to weed out the news cycles. Its just a solid uick appreciation of value.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:42:40


 Nonsense.
Even an accoutnst doing an ama on r bitcoin conceded it was a valid interpretation although he siad it was xmore aggressive".
Yes more aggressive than handing over thousands you dont owe.. But not at all crazy aggressive since after all i am following the guidance to the letter and to the example paying and reporting all taxes on all examples they give.
Its also worth saying , since there is no case law and no law from congress and only the one guidance from the irs, that no one is more of an expert than someone else in this new area of tax law.
A general accountant has no understanding of bitcoin and no incentive to save you money in this area becuase the risk to them if they are wrong is they may be held liable for some taxes or penalties you might later be assesed. Its far essier for them to recommend everyone pay thousands of extra dollars to the irs. After all its not their money.
I feel comfortable with this. If it comes to it in a few years I feel comfortable paying back taxes  and arguing there should be no penalty because it was an honest read of their own guidance if in the future the irs says they think shouod have paid more. I have been audited before. Sometimes i convince them. sometimes they convince me. This is true with most people in areas where interpretstions of tax law can vary. Its not uncommon or even scary. As long as your interpretations are honest and clearly justified and consistent year by year and you arent lying about amounts and havent falsified things. Thats been my experience with the irs. They have always been nice and professional. I have no resson to think they would be different in this area especially given the acknowledged confusion and requests by congress for more guidance which hasnt come.
But if you feel more comfortable liquidating assets to pay the irs thousands in taxes you may not even owe then.. hey...do what you think is best.
All this is just my opinion as i said.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:24:43
Frankly that would be a disaster and would probably result in marshal law and they would use that as an excuse to get rid of bitcoin somehow.
Its doing fine as it is. Lets not mess it up before it goes to $1,000,000 per coin.

You print a paper wallet.
You then go to the exchange and you put that recievng address in as your recipient address and transfer your bitcoin from the exchange into that address.
You absolutely positively make sure you give fhem the correct address or your coins will be lost forever and no one will be able to help you.
Personally when i print a paper wallet i also cut and paste my addreses to a text file. Then i cut and paste the recipient address to the exchange.

As lo g as you do t spend they will automatically be on both forks.
After the fork you will be able to isethat same wallet private address on both forks to spend or move to new wallets as long as miners keep the both forks working and they probably will.
Look what happened with ethereum. Both forks kept going. Now there is e and e classic.

Thats a sort of irrelevant but interesting question and i like it.
I dont know how you would calculate it though. 
I suppose you could write a program to through the blockchain and count transfers from original wallets that mined them at whatever the average price was on that day to get an idea.

No. Ypu need to do it before a fork takes place. Then your paper wallet will exist on both blockchains after the fork.

I wonder why they peaked in May.
Does this mean many people liquidated? I cant imagine it means they consolidated into fewer addresses as coin value went up. That would be unwise. It could mean whales or large trading houses are buying out more and more small bitcoin holders I guess.
What other reasons could there be?
Has any major trading or mining platform shifted procedures to use significantly less addresses during operations?
