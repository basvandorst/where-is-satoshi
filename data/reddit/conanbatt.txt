People also bought bitcoin on mtgox at market rate while it was insolvent. If the market believes the USDT is solid it might price it as it were, even if it isn't. 
It merits lots of analysis, if USDT falls, exchanges that deal with USDT will drop like flies.

What this reasoning doesn't take into account is that the price today takes into account the price of the future. 
If you knew water was going to run out entirely by the end of the year, the water is worth infinite now, not at the end of the year. 
You have to adjust the price today with the chances of that actually happening, which are very very low.

Sure, only that billions of dollars in demand disappear overnight, which means all comes crashing down, even if exchanges don't turn insolvent, which they would.

Kraken does turn USDT to USD. And bitfinex would be destroyed if USDT had some market-crashing issue. Thats like 40% of market volume right there. And if those two crash, and crypto crashes, the fee's collected by exchanges would drop enormously which affects their income and operations. 
Its no joke. This looks like systemic risk.

I don't think that math is right. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:04:43
I dont think there is colluding between exchanges, i think bitfinex is pumping so much cash that is lifting all boats, but eventually people need to cash in on this and turns out the money is not in circulation. If the system was flushed with 2 billion dollars that doesnt exist, then people cashing out will find out at a point that the money is not there.

Why did coinbase add LTC at all. Charlie and coinbase putting LTC isshows conflict of interest. Then Charlie leaves as soon as the coin is there (he made himself super rich with that move).
The only "alt" that is justified on coinbase is ETCH, LTC and BCH are very suspicious.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:50:37


It uses a big exchange to move the money around. If bitfinex went down, no USDT would enter the market today. There might be an expectation of solvency much like there was with Mt.Gox for a long time while it was already insolvent and nobody knew about it.
When that expectation ends, the price of Tether would drop significantly and at that point you will get a crypto-run. Just because its done 'voluntarily' doesn't mean its correct or reliable. I'm honestly surprised kraken shows such stable Tether values considering the source. You would expect a company with no audit and no buyback of tethers (because you cant trade them) to have a preimum for risk and yet its almost parity.
Also bear in mind that if bitcoin's utility has a natural value for today (lets call it n) and tether printing makes it above this value, the market will always tend to sell, and thus the necessity to print money to keep the price up will not stop until n increases to the current price. 
I'm not a trader, but I'm buying into this FUD, I don't see how this can end up well.

Thats not my thesis at all. Mine is that you cant infer anything from the price. The only thing that matters is the actual value BTC tends to, and that might be 1000 or 1mm. If the value of BTC tends to 1000, a person thinking they can average a loss from BTC going from 19k to 12k, will find himself poorer than by not buying at all, even if he "averaged down his losses".

If the mtgox hacker sells its coins to pay creditors its already 200,000 coins that would wreck gdax for months. (if it sold 2000 btc a day, it would tank the price for 200 days!). There would have to be a 3.4 billion investment into the space to just keep the price at it is!

Thats not dollar cost averaging, that requires long term periodic purchases (and potentially sells in some variations). A past loss is a loss, wether you put it on paper o delude yourself into thinking it wasn't. 
Putting more money after a losing round because its bound to bounce  back is the gamblers fallacy and one of the most ruinous human biases. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:39:30
There would be more valuable employment: the artificially low exchange means more chinese people work for outsiders instead of insiders than it would be otherwise.
Keeping an exchange artificially low is the equivalent to a chinese wage worker to puting a cap on their salary. If labor doubled their lroductivity and the state halved the exchange rate, the worker would earn the same money for more value provided, and its getting seized by the State. 
The dollar reserves the state has belong to the wokers and the capital that produced it, not to the bureacrats. The state should leevy its income on taxes, not on currency manipulation.

I agree. However there is one thing contrary to insider trading, which is creating the situation for insider trading.
I dont blame anyone capitalizing on that information from within coinbase: why not? Its such an obvious prize!
Its Coinbase that made the arbitrage possible by not disclosing the information to the general public. 
CB did screw its users, wether they intended it or not. There is always information arbitrage, but this one was provoked in an unacceptable magnitude.

The reason is chokeful of worthless altcoins is because the ones that will mean something having been issued yet.
A small startup with a million dollars in revenue that is not yet profitable has to spend about 2 months doing paperwork and meeting dozens of investors to get a few million dollars of oxygen today. Compare that process to how the ICO's are getting between 10 to 100 million range ICO's with nothing to show for.
Companies cant do that today because they dont know the legal ramification of it, but I can assure you startup founders would love to trade 2 month of investor negotiations for scraps for a 1 month presentation to get 10x the amount and a lot cheaper, with a lot less legal hassle. 
The reality is that markets without central figures still kind of work. You dont need the state to tell you who you can date, or where you can buy food. You do that yourself, and sometimes you get burned,  but the cost of regulation would be a lot worse.

I personally hope government is out of the equation for a long time before we decide regulation is needed.
Yes,its filled with scams, but eventually it wont be. People that do want to build cool stuff just don't have reasonable access to this line of funding yet. Eventually they will, and if they do, mere competition will make fraudulent ico's a failure.
Competition will drive out most of the scams out naturally. Or at least, I'd like to find out. Just think that if the government asks ICO's to require accredited investements, they will not be able to ask for coins internationally, and you wont be able to invest unless you are a millionaire.

I agree with this criticism entirely as well, though I believe it is also not the complete picture.
The day bitcoin really is useful for something, getting it at the quantities we do today would be insane. Think of bitcoins as land: was land valuable in America at the beginning? No, because it had no infrastructure, no community no nothing. Land was virtually free and thus people hoarded acres and acres of it. You could not create more land, the same way you can marginally create more bitcoin.
So is the 'bitcoin land' a good land to buy? Well, it has a huge evolving community, awareness, and real iinfrastructure and funding and investment. So I think that bitcoin has the capacity to come coveted land: but in the same measure, lots of land in the us is still pretty much worthless.
The price today is a reflection on the belief, irrational or not, that an irrefutably useful application will be found and applied and by then bitcoin would be a by-product cost of the service, not the service itself.
