I guess you could say that. My parents use my older sister life insurance to pay for my expenses. She passed away 3 years ago. She was hit by a drunk driver. To make matters worse I've been battling cancer, so there's a lot of layers to this onion.
Note: The life insurance policies exist as a tool to invest and eventually borrow against if things go really south. Like, a solid safety net. Luckily I got mine before I was diagnosed or even sick and my family felt horrible about receiving the money from my sister. She was only 24.

Yep you got that right. It'd be cool if it turns a profit but for now, it is what it is. 
Chances are the money is all going to cancer research after my parents and I pass on whenever that happens. I'm the last of the blood line. There won't be another generation. 
Life is hard but sometimes you just got to enjoy what exists in the here &amp; now.

You gotta give it to him. He managed to be a modern day imposter, just like [many before him throughout history.]( He's not the first to do this sort of thing and certainly is not the last. We'll probably see even more Satoshi imposters in the future.

No but bills + paying back the charge back would have. This person collected "back" that money that was refunded to my account.

It was a complete violation of boundaries. Technically they support me 100% due to some serious health issues. However, with that said, it has always been the agreement that the funds I get are mine and they are not to interfere with them. 
This means if I have extra at the end of the month, I have extra. If I run out a week early, well then I just deal with it and survive until the next "payday." They usually do not oversee my account or log in. They just happened to this past month and caused trouble because of their strong anti-bitcoin opinions.
I guess they have a right to do that, seeing as I'm dependent on them, but it doesn't make it any less upsetting.

I do not live at home but sometimes it feels like I might as well.

So much this. Karma is more than just fancy internet points.

Firstly, most important order of business is HAPPY CAKEDAY!
Secondly, no, they're just really anti-btc they're very old school and think its fluctuations are risky. TBH I use here &amp; there to gamble with and sometimes for things from [MAGIC](  since they accept BTC and due to limited mobility they can do things like pick up medications from the pharmacy/run errands for me when I can't do it myself.
Finally, is right. If I was buying drugs charge backs don't prevent it. LoL.
