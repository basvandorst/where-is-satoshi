Hey all! Just to clarify, I pledged to donate 1 BTC as soon as the ALS Association accepts donations in Bitcoin! I just dumped ice water on my head as they are not accepting BTC yet and for the heck of it. 
Again, as soon as they accept BTC donations, I will definitely donate 1 BTC. Hope you can encourage the ALS association and other organizations to accept donations in BTC! Thanks!

Thank you for getting up this announcement. Having served as a Legislative Aid and Legislative Correspondent, I am mindful of the type of language that will catch the eye of congressional staff, interns and eventually a Member of Congress or Senator.
It is key that the accurate terminology is used when addressing a Member of Congress: In lieu of stating, "Congress Person" it is better to state, Representative (member of the US House of Reps)_____ or Senator ________.
From there, you will acknowledge and personalize the note. As this is a form letter, it will be imperative to add a personal anecdote before sending off.
Quantity and quality of contact are absolutely key. When in doubt, be sure to add personal insight and avoid an email, letter, or fax that resembles a mass mailer if you do want a note to get on the desk of a Member of Congress or sr. staffer.

That is great!  Definitely a DISTRICT connection is key.  It is most effective when a Member of Congress understands a connection between BTC and their district whether it is a Bitcoin related business in their district, a large Bitcoin meet up group, a nonprofit/charitable organization benefiting from BTC.  Even just a personal anecdote of your story is significant.  
Nicely done!
