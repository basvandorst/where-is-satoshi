How did you get this data? I only used the regular API php sockets (e.g. ticker.php, getDepth.php &amp; getTrades.php) so far - but your format seems a lot more resourceful.
I checked my data btw - getDepth stopped offering information about any bids below $15.06 during the sell-off. It just remained an empty bracket from the time it broke through the $15 barrier. So unfortunately I'm unable to independently confirm your data - though I have no reason to doubt it.

So, in your oppinion, all coins deposited at MtGox are gone, but the cash in each user accounts still exists?

"2: a fall or crash caused usually by losing control "
I'm pretty sure a &gt;25% bid-offer spread in a currency market implies the loss of control. But lets not argue over wording here, I'm not Bernanke ... wait ... naah.

No, your image shows the very low volume spike-up afterwards, due to practically non-existent offers in the 23-29$ range. Since no bid volumes where backing it up, it fell right down again.
The sell-off displayed in my image started about an hour and a half before. Also, it was a rather constant and steady decline - not one single dark-pool sell order as speculated elsewhere.

So why would anyone try to sell that many stolen coins on MtGox? Can't they just block the whole account?
This doesn't make any sense.

The price with I agree on.

I probably have it... wrote a simple db routine that fetched the current orderbook every 30 seconds for like half a day or so and I believe it should have been running around the time.
The only problem is, the orderbook gets cut off. So if the price was above $10, there's no way of telling whether or not a $0.0101 bid was in the book or not.
The only chance for some conclusions would be if Kevin put in his bid when the price already hit the sub $5 range.
Will check that when I get home in a few hours and let you know.

Ubuntu it is.
