I'd treat bitcoin the same way I'd treat a casino: only play with what you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:31:19
Your expectations aren't certain. Everything you've just said equates what everyone else would call "hedging your bets." You're still just betting, with some information, that bitcoin will survive. You're making an informed gamble; that's still gambling.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:37:23
The stock market has been around for 200 years but you want to make an example of 2 years? Would you be willing to look at any 2 years? How about 12/2013 when it peaked to $1,000 to 12/2015 when it dropped to about $350. Sound good to you?
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:19:40
I'm getting really close to lol. I should have done it yesterday when it dipped down below 10k.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:37:33
No, actually, what is *your* point? My original comment was simply to give advice to newbies; don't risk more than you're willing to lose. Bitcoin is a gamble. We have no idea if it will be here in 10 years but there are some who are so into the idea of it that they're willing to risk everything because they see it as a get rich quick plan. 
I never mentioned timelines, investment plans, or comparisons to other valuable goods. It was simply "be careful." Bitcoin is highly volatile; it could all be gone as quickly as it became something to talk about.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:08:42
I think the meaning of the comment was at what point does a shit coin become legit?

@_date: 2019-07-04 09:47:28
No. You seem to have it all figured out and think bitcoin is fool proof. Divest your stock portfolio and go all in if you're so sure bitcoin isn't a gamble.

"Don't mortgage your house to gamble at a casino." That's not any different than what I've been saying but you want to pick at semantics. And the point of "willing to lose" being vague is so that it applies to everyone. Some people aren't willing to lose even one dollar. Others can afford to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"I am at a for me comfortable level of risk." So you've put in an amount you'd be willing to lose, just like I said.
And again, do *you* know the odds of failure? Because if you're trying to sound smart by asking me, you don't.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:19:29
You'd be correct. Every form of investment *is* gambling. There are just safe bets and high risk ones. Investing in bonds is a gamble because it *is* possible for a government to dissolve before you can cash out. Is it likely? No. Or you could buy shares in a penny stock hoping to quintuple your investment and the company goes insolvent. How likely? Very. Put money into a 401k for retirement hoping that it goes up? You might lose a ton of money if you happen to retire during a depression/recession.
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:12:01
Percentage of risk? Do *you* even know what it might be? What are you even smoking? Because my initial comment was to treat bitcoin like a casino; don't play with money you're not willing to lose. I never talked about percentage or even brought up gambling. The point of the message was don't drop everything you have into it. End. Nothing else to it. Then you come in and talk about how great it is, how the concept is infallible, and how it can only go up. Now you want to talk about percentage that don't exist? That's why I'm telling you to go drop you're entire life savings into it. If you're so 100% sure that it can't fail then you might as well put your money where your mouth is. If you're not willing to do that then you need to shut the fuck up about managing risk because you obviously know jack shit about it.

I think the majority of people who use Facebook don't care about the image or reputation. You're also talking about a massive group of people who don't even know how to use technology but communication has been made easy through Facebook. Once they find out any bit of news about Libra (obviously bias towards Facebook on the platform), they'll be using it en masse.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:48:08
Once they have it all, it will become worthless, just like real money.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:14:01
I wish I had stopped watching the price. I got out way way too early because I had "made enough and I don't want this bubble to burst on me" and got a car (because I needed it for work anyway). Now I'm kicking myself because if I could have waited, I could have 4 cars right now.

Rogue Barista sounds like a good writing prompt.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:43:13
You're not being cute with "Wut?" so cut the crap about being confused. Nobody knows where bitcoin is going to be. It most definitely is not past the the point of big chance of losing. When I say only play with what you're willing to lose, I mean don't mortgage your house to go all in. Just because it's above 10k right now doesn't mean it can't crash back below it and suddenly only be 4k again. 
A week ago it was 13k and then suddenly dropped below 10k 3 days ago. A month ago it was hovering around 7.5k. And it was only 1 year ago when it hit the ATH and fell to 3k in 6 months. 
You're lying to yourself if you think you aren't gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:23:25
You don't have to buy whole coins. Don't let the price scare you. If you only have $50 a month to spare, then $50 a month is what you buy.
Don't risk more than you can lose. Don't bankrupt yourself trying to get in. And don't be afraid to get out when you're uncomfortable.

@_date: 2014-02-10 23:24:02
I don't know why everyone is giving you a hard time but I also wouldn't compare BTC to USD. I'd say the value should be based on good/services as you said as well as how much people are willing to pay for it (btc). If people are buying in at $900/1BTC, then that should be the price. And so on.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:48:10
A lot of people don't see bitcoin as a currency but as an investment. They just want the price to go up.
@_date: 2019-11-21 03:49:15
The point of this is to encourage spending. But if you want your life savings under your mattress, have at it.

The point of what Johnny is saying isn't that you would want to cash out at $5. By giving up your freedom to trade, you give up the ability to stay fluid should some kind of legislation or personal emergency arise. 
My personal opinion is if you're the type of person that needs a time-lock in order to invest, you probably shouldn't be in Bitcoin. Go deal with an investment manager who can give sound advice and keep your money in things that are more stable/predictable like stocks, mutual funds, and bonds.

There hasn't been a shred of information exchanged that would qualify as education. All that has happened is someone countered a point or asked a question and a google link was posted. That's like someone asking for information and you point them to a library. Is that technically wrong? No. Is that helpful? Also no. And it definitely doesn't prove you know anything about the topic being discussed. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:01:55
Again, the fact that you can't explain it yourself when asked says a lot about the knowledge you claim to have.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:58:30
Awesome. I'll definitely check that out. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:31:51
Once again, a non-answer. It seems like there's no real value to the information you think you know and thus, can't answer with anything but insults. 
I'm not asking from a stand point of ignorance, BTW. I was looking for a different perspective. Seems like you don't even have one to give. Have a nice life. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:28:38
I don't have a problem with a complex answer. I simply asked a question of how bitcoin works without the internet. Instead I got a snarky answer and directed towards an author I've already read about. 
I didn't make myself to be the expert on any topic as bluethunder1985 has, which is why I asked. If he knows the topic as well as he's been implying then he should have no problem giving a simple, if not slightly inaccurate, answer. Something as simple as "(XYZ) is why but if you want a more detailed answer, go here." Instead, I get "I suggest you all read the internet of money by andreas... If you don't get it you need extra help." 
So, yeah, I get that the solution is complex. But being an asshole without giving any proof of information, validity, or pretending to be an expert while hiding behind a veil vagueness (IE, bullshit) does not bode well with anyone.

Admit that I'm wrong to saying what? I asked for your interpretation/explanation to what you said. Not Google's; not Andreas'; yours. Your understanding of what you're trying to say. You've provided no evidence what so ever; a link to a google search that points to hundreds of documents about varying topics is not evidence.

This is the first time I'm hearing about Gemini. What are the differences in charges between the two?
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:03:18
Mixed. On one end, I see a bubble, just like they've always been. On the other, I see that the political and economic climate are almost right for cryptocurrencies to really take off. 
That being said, I see more of the bubble. People in power aren't going to make it easy for bitcoin and the like to really get off the ground. This might be one of the many waves but each one has gotten bigger. If you're getting in, stay in for the long haul. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:54:16
What u/jystrebler. Except I disagree with not buying in now. If you have the funds and can spare it, do it. Even if the bubble pops tomorrow (which would suck) just get in and ride with it. BTC has done nothing but gone up since it's inception. Buy now, hold it for a while. 
But as any smart gambler will tell you: don't play with what you're not willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:40:31
Holy shit. So we're talking like 7x the fees. Yeah, I think I'll be switching soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:58:38
I never considered China or India. Now that you mention it, I'm surprised it hasn't caught in China. I thought they already had users there. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:57:42
Which exchange is that? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:51:12
Keep putting a little each paycheck. Even if it does crash, when you start buying the little bits afterwards, it will even out. IE, you buy a coin at $2,500 today, it crashes tomorrow. You buy another coin at $800. You now have two coins for a total spent of $3,300. This means you really only spent $1,650 on two coins. Everything you buy after that just keeps lowering the average cost until it bounces up again. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:58:43
I wish I had taken advantage of this feature years ago when BTC was sub $300. I could have spent $25 a week on coin instead of going out to eat and I'd be rolling in cash right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:33:51
Yeah, the timing of transactions are a real killer to someone who isn't sure or isn't financially stable. Given that, Bitcoin has been on an uptrend for a long time. There have been dips, and bubbles, but it's always been up on the long term. That being said, deep down I agree that right now it's a really volatile time and I can't shake the feeling that it's a bubble ready to pop. But, I reinvested anyway with what I could spare. If I loose, it's not much, but the gain could be huge.

The alt coins depend on Bitcoin being valuable. They always have. Given that, if all of the alt coins take a massive dip simultaneously, Bitcoin will follow simply because of the masses trying to exit the market. They'll sell their Bitcoin along with any alts they have.

If your brother can part with the current price, and the plan is to hold it for 10 years anyway, then just do it. Nobody here can tell you when it's going to come down or to what price it will come down to. You could end up waiting until it hits 10k and drops down to 5k.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:11:49
It's down 800 from a high of 2700. Still up for most long termers though.

@_date: 2017-05-25 02:22:30
Yeah, I hear ya and I definitely 100% agree. One can only hope that BTC will be a six figure item. I've already seen articles speculate that it could reach seven figures in 5-10 years. Dreamers I say but then again, dreamers built first cars and airplanes. Let's hope it works out. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:07:49
Do it now. Buy for long term. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:56:04
Bitcoin will never be "too expensive to spend" because you can spend fractions of it. If a single coin is worth $100,000 and you want buy something that is $30,000, you spend 0.3 of one coin.

If you're going to be specific about the last 5 years then anyone holding would have done well. Of course, until the last year, anyone flipping could have made a ton of money also, as the price of the coin was pretty stable for a while. Also, in the last 2 months, anyone flipping could be making $500 every week per coin for each time it's dipped and turned around. Granted, they would have to be almost clairvoyant, extremely lucky, or pumping/dumping the market. So, the odds are that holders have done well but don't discount people who are good at reading the market. Most people aren't, I'll give you that. But there are some who just know how to do it. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:53:50
Coinbase has a bad rep for their customer service (though I haven't had any problems yet). Add the swarm of people who are probably trying to get into the market now and you're looking at days, maybe even a week, response time.
