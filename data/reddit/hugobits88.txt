Look I’m pointing out that he has those same coins you call shit that actually work as intended. He has them.. he has the “shit”coins that work.. he doesn’t have to buy them. No promotion needed.

If you mined it back in the day you should have the same coin in B-C-H, you'll find its much more useful, low fees, no need to ever look back and be concerned about transaction costs.

Looking at price only is your a fatal flaw. What happens when you can’t remove your Bitcoins.. that price will start to slip. I look at fundamentals. What makes a crypto a great currency to use. What gives it value. The fact that it’s sitting at a tenth of the price of BTC is of no concern. All that matters is that it works as intended.

That sucks! I bought yours at 300

actions speak louder than words, and right now the mempool( is chocablock and dangerously sitting on a fine line that could possibly crack. the writing is on the wall I'm afraid. there is no backing out of this dilemma

Ye i agree... it's the bandwidth that's important.. having 10 minutes to download an 8mb block is not an issue... and download speeds are increasing at an incredible rate.. i had a 2mb line only
Four years ago.... we should have fiber by year end that is 50x faster than the the quickest DSL in my
Country.. and I live in Africa... I don't see any issues with Big Blocks.. our issues in my country are high banking fees...

Everyone cannot afford a node... it's not designed that way... Nodes are only meant to he run by miners and merchants... everyone else should have light wallets.. that still keeps it decentralized so that no government can control the network or shut it down.. 8mb blocks is still small in terms
Of hardware capabilities... I'm running a big block node on my 6 year old computer. Sorry for jumping onto this group.. I'm not here to fight. I'm also concerned about decentralization..

I agree with you on this. It also concerns me that Blockstream are involved in core development and they have huge financial backing from the banks to create side chains, segwit intentions! those bankers are going to want to see their returns soon. Maybe something to think about.

Bitcoin adjustable block cap is just an idea that stems away from the blockstream side chain implementation. Its called competition, and Its healthy. Using Mockery shows how young(childish) and in denial some people are.
