Gold comes from super novas, no one can  write more bitcoin. You don't know what you're talking about.
Whether or not bitcoin fails the technology it has introduced will never go away. Blockchain is valuable in every technical field. They're not really comparable imo, blockchain is much more valuable than gold
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:15:09
It goes up in value and you can store it in a hard drive rather than having bundles of gold bars under your mattress
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:29:18
Yup bitcoin will probably do the same thing. But gold has about 7.8 trillion in market cap, damn sure it was more at its peak. Bitcoins around 200 billion, we got a long way to go before it hits its peak. Regardless cryptocurrency as a whole is technology that will keep improving where gold is just a hunk of material.

Xrp is the second most expensive coin by market cap. It is also over valued and has no real world applications. RIPPLE network would be huge for banks but that doesn't replicate Xrp. They're two different things and the token is not needed to own to use Ripple network. Also where is this xrp road map?  I see no official roadmap
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:07:09
Premined and continuous printing. Controlled by old farts &amp; it loses value so they take more of yours to make sure their supply is still valuable.

Time will tell what the banks decide to do. To build on to their existing network or replace it with a centralized, manipulable cryptocurrency. Regardless of what they chose it doesn't mean XRP value will increase because the banks aren't interested in the coin, they only care about the network. There's still too much risk trusting Ripple corp to not dump all their coins, or undercut the users in favor of the banks. 
Lumens are my shit tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:51:07
Too bad banks will probably just stick to swift network since they're upgrading this year anyways. Talking about not following stuff psh.

All have and will be manipulatable.
Cryptos because of its unregulated nature, gold: the most recent example I can think of is the US search and seizures of 1933, fiat for the same reason and a thousand more.

Anyone is a retard if they think bitcoin is only valuable because of USA. Sure if they outlawed it here it would suck for you and the price would drop but there are other people in the world and many that know blockchain is the future. To repeat. You can't just kill bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:55:49
I just think that if they do ban it it would be quickly unbanned. It is just inevitable, too many are involved now. There are US companies using the technology and crypto for the betterment of the world. If they banned it I imagine it would just be a power move that wouldnt hold.

Okay stick to your hyper inflated USD, I really could care less. You're not helping anyone. I don't necessarily believe bitcoin will be the one true currency, nor do I believe USD &amp; banks will disappear but cryptocurrency as a whole isn't going anywhere either. We can have both and hold value in both but why should people not be able to chose where they hold their value? Not everyone wants their worth to be controlled by a government entity. Trump could kill the dollar in his term, that bubble has been building. There hasn't been a single republican that hasn't put our country in recession which led to more dollars being printed, driving the value lower and lower but ya know.. keep holding your bag.. or don't.. since it's not even owned by you.

Money; "the assets, property, and resources owned by someone or something; wealth."
USD, Crypto, Pokemoney, these all hold value. 
Why are paper bills worth anything at all? Because a centralized entity told you "this dollar is worth one dollar" without any real value behind it at all. They keep printing more and giving more people money even though the majority of it doesn't even circulate because the top 1% hoard them all so in reality the value keeps dropping and the 1% get more money by raising prices. There's no value behind money like there was with the gold standard but even with the gold standard you could say the same damn thing.
Why are CryptoCurrencies worth anything? Because everyone who uses them are valuing them as such. It has a set number or set inflation/deflation that can't be changed without decentralized consensus. Not to mention all the other uses that the blockchain can provide for us in more than just the money world. Not that anyone cares since we're just in it for the money right guys?
If one person accepts what the other person provides than yes it is a medium of exchange, It's a bit anarchic but we're about to reach a point where the buyer can use any currency and it will automatically exchange for the sellers required currency which is something we can't even do with paper money. If someone accepts only USD but then someone brings them pesos they'll refuse them. Does that mean that his pesos are valueless? No, this is extremely arrogant. Our current system is flawed &amp; the majority of crypto users would rather take the power of money away from the centralized entities &amp; the have the value of wealth to come from the people. 
Here's how I rate the value of wealth. Cryptocurrency &gt; Pokemoney cards &gt; USD.

Tether doesnt even want their tokens back. You can trade them on binance for btc, ltc, eth, neo, BCC, BNB. Just click sell instead of buy
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:56:37
You must be pretty new here to think you can't use crypto in the real world. Infact it addresses all above statements: Store of value is better than ever because we don't need banks to store it, we can hold it in a ledger and keep it as safe as possible. The Unity of Account is infinitely times better than fiat because it's at a set rate or with coins that do use inflation and deflation are all exactly stated in their whitepapers. Look up IBM and XLM and see how it will soon become the greatest medium of exchange the world has ever seen, we will literally be able to use any asset we want in any field of exchange, whether it's paying rent or going to the grocery store &amp; will be able to use ANY currency we want and they'll receive ANY currency they prefer. The future is coming, the fiat system died when it started. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:54:52
But you can't go into every store globally and use the same currency to buy shit. Just look at what XLM &amp; REQ is attempting to do, we'll be able to go to any store with any currency and the blockchain will take care of it for us, we can use ETH, BTC, XLM, ect and the seller will receive their precious FIAT. This is something dollar bills won't and can't do.
