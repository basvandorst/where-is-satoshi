You must be brain dead. 
Dead-end job. DEAD-END JOB.
Go learn some new words before bragging about your great ass job to a kid on the internet lmao.

I'm not blaming it on my age, I'm saying that at such a young age I don't really need money so I was careless with it. Ive made several websites in the past as well. Failure and learning from your mistakes is all part of succeeding.

So what you're saying is that you're even more mad that 14 year old has gotten you angry?
Also which part of this is a troll? I made a post about how I lost funds in BTC and then you decided to go off topic and brag about how much money you make. 
Kinda sucks that someone as young as me is getting you upset. 
Maybe you're into kids or something considering you like seeing them with bruises. Kinda weird homie. Get some help.
Also what the hell is "buttmad"? 
You should order a dictionary with all that money you said you had.

A dead-end job is normally referred to as a job were you aren't making much money at all and can't go up. If you have already gone up/don't need to go up/don't WANT to go up then it doesn't really apply. 
And don't be angry at me just because you failed 6th grade english.

So you aren't refuting that you failed 6th grade english? Kinda sad man. 
Why are you getting so mad at what a 14 year old is saying to you online? Giving you memories of being bullied in high school?

You should order an English dictionary so you don't sound like a degenerate. 
Also just because your father had sexual relations with you as a child doesn't mean you gotta give back pedophilia isn't a joke.
