Ledger doesn't need to honor anything for you to get it. Ledger is a personal key storage device. All you need is your keys to "claim" you bgold. There will be a special wallet after the fork. You don't have to do anything now except be in sole possession of your keys at the time of the fork. As far as coinbase, don't count on it. Very doubtful they give you any bgold for your btc holdings.

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:39:51
Kraken is an exchange. Bitcoin is going nowhere. If you deposit amounts over $5000 via wire transfer, and place market-maker limit orders, you start saving on fees substantially. How much savings depends on the exchange. ItBit for example has $10 wire fee, plus free market maker orders. This is quite efficient for large amounts, depending also on you particular bank's wire fee, which varies $10-50 per wire.

I don't know what "absent btc" is. Better not think of it as a "split" of bitcoins per say, but a split, as in fork in the code. This creates a duplicate snapshot of the blockchain as of the fork date. Nobody can take your bitcoin. Supply is fixed. The new fork coin will be bonus coins of a different network, and you will own them in addition to the bitcoin you already possess. Many people find it useful to think of fork coins as being like stock dividends.

I don't think this clears up the "fundamental" misunderstandings you see online and in this sub. You describe bitcoin as a digital coin that can't be duplicated. I think people get that much. It's wallets and public-key encryption that people don't get at first. They don't get the importance of holding their own keys, or how to do it securely. They also don't understand the price discovery mechanism of markets, or why Bitcoin price keeps going up or down.  
So many are producing these Bitcoin-for-Dummies sort of videos. But they never provide sources and references to where the viewers can dig deeper, and learn to stop being noobs.

Bubble or not, Bitcoin is susceptible to massive volatility, and extreme bull/bear cycles. Some might say it's a distinction without a difference.
I'm not sure why people obsess with this word bubble. Especially in this, franky pseudo scientific, context. You haven't clearly defined a bubble, but you go through painfully elaborate reasoning why it's not a bubble. I don't get it.   
To me, and many others I suspect, a bubble is just a pejorative for something you expect to fail but for which there is a lot of hope for it's success.  Saying "Bitcoin is not a bubble" is like saying "I believe Bitcoin will succeed as the market is expecting". The answer is only evident in the future, after we find out who is right.  There is no proof possible.   
Therefore, this reads like sophistry and misleading marketing to me.

Your wallet isn't a single key pair. It's called a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet, which generates all the keys you need every time you make a transaction.

By "public key", you mean master public key, right? Since you want to generate HD addresses. The ability to track multiple master public keys would be good. Also, since these keys are definitely sensitive private information, I suggest encrypted storage of the keys, and a secure authentication for access.
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:04:34
The blockchain is copied as of the fork date. So you have exactly the same number of tokens on the new fork that you had on the original. After the fork, you get a special wallet to access your keys on the new chain. You get free money in this sense. Nobody knows how much it will be worth, or if the value of your original Bitcoin will go down too.  All you have to do is keep your Bitcoin in a wallet where you control the keys, and you will find out later how to get your fork coins.

A wedge issue in some respects. Anti-replay-protection arguments would say replay protection is bad because it helps ensure the minority chain stays around, rather than encouraging a more total consensus to form around a single fork. The general public has tended to think of replay protection as being more polite, to help ensure a more secure transition. Replay attacks can result in lost coins if the users are ignorant or not careful (meaning coins will definitely be lost and stolen without replay protection). But contentious forks are contentious, so....
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:54:57
No. When banks print money, they don't give it to everyone in proportion to the amount they already hold. They give the freshly printed money to their friends only. When a bank prints money, it's wealth redistribution, like a tax. When a fork happens, it's like everyone got a dividend on their current holdings. Big fucking difference. Further, since it's a new "kind" of money, it has the potential to create more value that didn't exist before. It could also be worthless. But it's something different, rather than just being more of the same.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:49:41
