There is nothing google can do. The phishing site more then likely paid for a top spot as a add and you may have mistakenly clicked it. Unless that person is just nice and sends your almost 40,000 back your screwed

Dude your crazy! Good luck living in your disillusioned thought process. The fact that you keep bringing up crooked Hillary and can’t see how fucked up trump and his whole administration is. I’m not pro either, but saying trump and his cabinet are godlike and put on this pedestal is ignorant.

Read his name, he might not be in middle school but has the mental capacity of one. Just read the conversation he is trying to have lol.

Trump is about giving power to people with money. More corporate and lobbying control is just as bad as more governmental control. So while I agree that he is bringing less government by making his pockets fatter, it is not better for the people. So keep thinking trump is some god in your disillusion when he fucks everybody over in the end.

Unsure if stupid, or satire. Judging by the name I can only hope this is a big con and your pranking everybody

Your a fucking moron and might end up in jail for slander. There is literally no evidence/trail/or verdict for this. Maybe you should get out of your tiny view of the world and do some actual research.

Show any proof to back that statement up and I will believe you. Your just pulling numbers out of your ass.
