Just to clarify for confused Americans (since I did a double take at it, I'm sure other people are as well) - some parts of the world use a . instead of a , for breaking up their numbers. So that's 1,000€ not 1€.

Money generally exchanges hands when a child is adopted, too, but few people consider that a purchase.

I'll totally escrow it for you guys. mhmm. yep.

They're pretty much made up numbers, though. He may as well have saved himself some time and just made them up in the first place.

Or he could just close the account.

The onus generally falls on somebody making a positive claim rather than a negative claim. It's not reasonable for him to submit evidence of every single court case ever in order to show that none of them were about scammers being forced to return money. A recap of every court case ever would probably take quite a few posts :3 However, it's remarkably easy for that to be disproven since it would only require you to show a single case.
Which you haven't.

Credit card companies are not synonymous with card processors. Amazon makes money processing Visa/MC payments for other websites.

Somebody earning 100k a year is still middle class. If he's single and living like a cheap bachelor, it'd be real easy to put a large chunk of that away.

But those up/down votes aren't real votes. Reddit fudges the vote count to help prevent spam. Largely it's down when bots downvote things (which is going to be happening pretty heavily on a subreddit like where there's money to be made and people are actually welcome to new places to use the coins). They'll add the bot downvote to the tally but then toss an upvote on their to counter balance it in the vote. That will lead to really misleading stats.
I think they do some more fudging after that since most posts that get upvoted everywhere hover between like 66-72% like it tallies regardless of the subject.
Plus, even if they didn't, downvotes mean different things. You might have people downvoting because they don't want a bitcoin debit card or you might have people downvoting because they don't want polls on like this.

This is an awful way to conduct a poll. 
For starters, Reddit obscures voting results. The numbers you see to the right on here are fudged and probably don't really reflect the actual vote count. Second, you're only sampling people who are already likely to use bitcoins. If you're in that market, why wouldn't you use a bitcoin debit card? You need to be sampling a less biased market unless you want a "Of bitcoin users, all of them would like to see bitcoin usable" result. Third, internet polling like this is all self-selected and doesn't really create unbiased results. There's no "I'm unsure" option and you have no way to know how many people declined to take it when seeing it.

Agreed, the whole situation sounds kind of crappy. Shame on him for trying to back out in such an underhanded manner. Poo on coinbase for taking so long to process orders, poo on them even more for apparently not locking in prices when they went up after the order but locking you in when they've gone down.

Really, even if you ignore all the bias and smart things that brought up, you still have to deal with Reddit's obfuscation! The numbers on the side are about as meaningful as Whose Line points.

Politically speaking, both of the candidates running for office last time around seemed to consider 250,000 household income to be the upper threshold of middle class. Romney's statement was explicit, Obama's more in his promises of not raising tax for the middle class being defined as not raising tax below the 250k income tax bracket. 
100k would put you in the top 21% of household incomes, so I guess it really depends on where you want to draw the line. Personally, I don't think a 100k vs 70k income difference really results in that big of a lifestyle difference.
