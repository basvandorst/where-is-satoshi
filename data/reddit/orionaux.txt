Thanks. Took me forever to find it because of the 0 in the name lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:38:26
FairX, once it launches.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:12:04
I think it’s different between US citizen vs non. US USD is insured by FDIC. Everybody else and everything else (including US crypto) is generically insured.

More like a large upload plan. I thought my cap was download only but it was actually combination of up plus down. Oops. I now have up limits set. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:44:46
Thanks! Gonna try the xml import statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:07
 Then towards the top right of screen click on depth chart. You can control the zoom by clicking the plus or minus on either side of the price. I usually watch it at a 1000 dollar range. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:46:06
Does it support other coins beside BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:03:11
Remind me 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:38:01
Why is it not sorted high to low? I use coinbase , gdax, and waiting for verification on bitstamp. Bitstamp isn’t sorted properly. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:45:43
Does it support other coins besides BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:34
Hopefully GDAX is using all real coins and not floating it...  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:03

Haha, your clickbait title worked on me.

The love of money is the root of all evil. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:04:49
You can see the same trend by drawing a rosy ring around the posie. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:42:58
$16,643. 
What source will be used for the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:10:59
They said at LEAST 60 minutes. Looks like they are taking full advantage of the “at least”. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:20:41
I read a news article that said less than 1% of Americans can explain how bitcoin works. I would say this is equitable to people “knowing” about bitcoin (ie, how blockchain works, how to buy, sell, hodl). A lot more people are “aware” but don’t “know.”
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:05:32
This article got me riled up. We should do as the article says and everyone request the third parties that the IRS contacts. 
And it figures it would be Republik of California court from whence comes this decision....
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:29:20
Good reminder!
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:32:47
Mine are all on core wallet. I know to have them off exchange, but is core going to work the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:39:25
Is that what you told people that bought only $0.08 worth a few years ago?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:28:58
Not your keys, not your coin. 
At least peoples USD is FDIC insured?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:42
I only expect it to go a little under 12k next downturn. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:09
Title of the night. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:54:46
Haha. Wish I could say it was by some Sherlock Holmes style sleuthing, but it was just the random button. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:03:59
Hodl, hold, keep, store, never let go.

@_date: 2017-11-08 05:01:51
A bit more info would be helpful. 
Full disclosure: can’t watch YouTube right now with volume and the auto captions aren’t great. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:34
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:38:15
I had to do mine in reverse order of how they were received. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:50:34
Nice article that supports price increase as utility increases. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:11:36
Cool. Thanks. I even subscribed to your newsletter. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:16:03
Excellent distinction. People might be aware of it but most have no clue how it functions or how to safely buy and move it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:32:39
Because demand would stay the same or continue to rise but at halvening the supply is reduced because it’s not mined as fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:15:43
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:36:00
I’m running mine! Maybe this is deserving of a post on bitcoinbeginner but I only can accept inbound when on WiFi. I was guessing it’s a router config issue but when I test the port while on Ethernet cable it still can reach necessary port. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:57:20
Which forums do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:34:26
I expected to se Satoshi’s face on the bill. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:42:10
Is it possible they could SAY they aren’t going to do it and then do it anyway? 
Not sure exactly what that mean, but it seems in the realm of possibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:33
Same for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:06:39
Lol. I suppose so. LH didn’t give any hacks to overcome these things. Except for: avoid!  
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:27:57
The new wave is Bitcoin Platinum /s. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:28
Not really. I want to buy the dip , not panic sell
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:51:20
Tbh I don’t exactly remember, but I think it was exact decimal without dollar sign. Ie:
0.12 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:25:08
I think he got the time right, just had the wrong time zone. Should be 9:37 AM pacific. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:09:07
I think it’s like 10x what it was a few weeks ago. It used to be under 1k. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:32:55
Yes, but partially because the USD bubble will pop. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:29:12
About 500 or 5000, respectively. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:52:54
I have a friend in suburbia there and we were just talking about this. She said it fluctuates between 14 and 16 but spikes up to 20 during high useage months like summer months. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:57:05
What if I buy both after the fork? How would I even do that?
Edit: correcting auto correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:47:44
It’s on sale cyber Monday 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:59:15
I know this is the bitcoin thread, but what if it goes the other way?
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:07:04
The stupid isn’t in the sub, it’s in Lifehacker. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:26:50
They are shutting down the exchange for 6 hours. Looks like Coinbase expects it to fail.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:50:28
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:22:19
Old news. It’s at $8821 on GDAX now. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:32:49
Sorry. Should have clarified. That is the BASE electrical price. She decided it wasn’t worth it.

This guy understands how the rich get richer. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:25:54
My thoughts exactly. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:30:25
Huh? It was 8k+ last month. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:32:17
Do you get double on Friday and none on Saturday? /s
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:45
As soon as gdax is back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:05
People that live in a base-10 society. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:41:27
I have funds waiting to buy dip ever since I missed 5500 two weeks ago lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:35:34
That is a poor freeze frame thumbnail of the video. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:44:10
It’s a joke based on manna in the Bible. The Israelites were instructed to gather double on the day before the sabbath and then none on the sabbath so they didn’t work.

OP said bitcoin, so I guess 1.00000000. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:11:31
Does this mean there is a dip within a dip? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:00:56
Electric companies should start accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:14:00
Nooo. The climb wasn’t supposed to happen until I could use funds in my Robinhood account to buy the dip.

I would and then just replace it + 10%. That way I’m paying a 10% tax to the bank (I’m the bank). 
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:26:40
I get that this sub is very smart but it does need simplified. There are people that can’t make change for a dollar out there. How do you expect them to convert milli-sats and sats and kilo-sats. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:03:42
Then people will try to find how to revive dead coins. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:19:45
Maybe someday bitcoin will be a planet. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:08:02
Pluto is a moon now right? Pluto 1 million.
