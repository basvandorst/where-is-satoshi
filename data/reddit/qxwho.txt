Peppers? That's not the type of crisis he's talking about...  More like recession / correction. Bullets, toilet paper, alc and cigarettes will not be worth anymore then what you pay at the store.

Awe man... Again?

If ever the system goes that far...if they really fall apart, Bitcoin itself will be useless.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:09:22
That's awesome!
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:16:21
That's what you think..
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:15:17
Which means nothing what so ever.
" If what the bitcoiners expect is the death of fiat, or hyperinflation... The next financial crisis could very well be one of necessary prepping... "
Venezuela is one country in a sea of others. The world around them is not falling apart. The global bitcoin infrastructure is not affected by what goes on in Venezuela. IF everything crashed globally , bitcoin would not survive. That's when as you said earlier, bullets, toilet paper, alcohol and cigarettes would find their value. But again the topic earlier wasn't about massive fallout it was more about a simple recession. In a world where financial ruin is occurring people are not going to care about ones and zeros. Bartering will come back.

Nothing extraordinary about that.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:35:45
No it's really not. And if you could predict it you wouldn't be asking.

You're really starting to reach. No one can time the market. Period. Don't care how much past data you have, or who is analyzing.. Past performance is not an indicator of the future.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:02:27
And thanks for yours....
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:35:33
Don't put yourself in that position. Save the 200.

They aren't stealing it, their buying.
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:12:21
No one can predict the price. Period. How many fucking times are we going to have to go over this.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:29:22
Ya what?
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:50:46
That was awesome
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:45:59
Correct, because bitcoin is not an investment. It is speculation. I love crypto but man do people need to learn the difference.

You had time to write the post. May as well spend the time googling.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:08:59
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:51:43
Nope. But I love it anyways. It's just another tool in the box.
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:22:23
Lol. No. But the info you want is there. Instead of getting people to do the work for you, go do it.
