So true..someone gave me a $5 bill yesterday that had obviously been in someone's bloody coke nose. I don't have to touch that nastiness with bitcoin.

my friends told me about bitcoin in 2011, and I said screw that internet money. Then I went all in december 2017 at 19k..but I didnt stop there...I decided to move half over to litecoin at $350 after bitcoin dropped. Then I got fired in february. Three failed suicide attempts later..here I am praying to graphs on reddit in a public library hoping the janitor doesnt find me tonight. I never thought my life would come to this.

I called it a bubble and internet money until it reached 10k...then I educated myself and bought a f*ck ton of bitcoin

Banks have lost the trust of people. Just look at what is happening in India. People can't take money out to pay for hospital bills because the bank won't allow it. We have been long overdue for change in the finance sector. I am sure there are plenty of other austrian economists in this thread who would agree.

I do this too! Keep it up! Also tell your friends. It's more important than you realize.

THANK GOD for the cartoons that are educational. I saw some cartoons now are promoting climate change activism. Hell, back in the 70's it was mass paranoia about a global ice age! Kids don't realize lobbyists create such paranoia for money, not the damn climate.

Same reason I quit using coinbase. If we aren't careful, blockchain could submit everyone to more government scrutiny rather than freeing us. All under the pretense of "protection".

There is a reason projects like 0x are popular right now. It's because they are extremely important.
