Tech company owners no longer need revenue.  They create a userbase and then they sell the whole company to a larger company that wants access to the userbase.

Result of greed: Hey let's fork an emergency difficulty adjustment to bitcoin and pump its price so low-information users think it's worth something.  Then we'll mine it only when it's worth mining the rest of the time we'll let the emergency code decrease the difficulty so that it is minable again soon and we'll make more money then ever and keep being able to use covert ASIC boost.  Meanwhile everytime we go to mine fork coin it slows down the bitcoin network.  Hurray.

What you are saying could be used as an argument against all ETF's, but the market has already spoken.  ETF's are here to stay.  People find the convenience of ETF's extremely valuable.

Arguably part of the reason altcoins have taken off.
Or you know, low information investors who convince themselves shitcoins are the next bitcoin so they don't have to feel emotionally left out for missing out.

Dash has been all about small purchases!  It even has a monthly marketing budget.  The dash brand is on a jet right now flying around.  Nobody buys coffee with it.  Good luck Bcash.

That's hilarious but it paints a picture of false equivelency which technical users know is not true.

The asymmetric EDA is the defining feature of BCH.  It wouldn't be doing as well if it weren't for it...  why else would miners pump it?
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:36:48
Very misleading.  You only discussed the benefits re: fitting more transactions per block.  How about fixing transaction malleability?  Fixing covert asic boost?  Those fixes are what we really needed.

I think bigger blocks is a good idea!

He must be embarassed when bitmain admitted that they did implement ASICBOOST on their chips. lol

We aren't in court here, there is no burden of anything.  Business can do as it wants.  I find it very suspicious purse.io is submitting development ideas for the bitcoin protocol when their own website needs serious programming help.  To calm my suspicion I would like them to be transparent about who they are partnering with and taking money from.

The miners are supposed to be selfish.
Sadly when bitcoin protocol was written, a bug allowed for asicboost to exploit the protocol.  This bug has destroyed the incentive structure for miners.
The incentive structure was supposed to encourage greedy miners to update bitcoin to improve the network and thus improve their income.  But this bug has broken this incentive structure by creating an incentive against updates to the protocol that change block header information (aka most updates).
Bitcoin's incentive structure for miners is broken.
The community must fix it.  Miner may see past short term gains and realize that long term having an incentive structure that encourages upgrades is best for them.  
Users should see this bug fix as a must to fix miner incentives to how they were intended.
Jihan has already decided he does not want to fix miner incentive structure and his myopia has harmed bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:02:58
Yes, Jihan is a natural result of the bug.  It is the bug that has destroyed miner incentives.  The bug must be fixed.
Jihan will fight the fix.  It's up to the users and other miners aside from Jihan.
What we will probably see is bitcoin stagnate and never get fixed.  This will serve as a great warning to other block chains to make sure their miner incentive structure is perfect.

Thank you!
One thing coin market cap never had is an estimate of amount of coins in circulation 10 years from now, 20, 30, etc.  would be really good to help us conceptualize where a coin is in its lifecycle compared to other coin, which is what I use this sort of data for.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:59:38
I think he means first we should patch the ASICBOOST exploit that has destroyed the incentive structure for miners.
Once the miners are incentivized to upgrade bitcoin as intended and as we had previously believed they would, segwit will be more palatable.
The incentive structure not supporting upgrades that affect the block header data is a serious problem that could block almost all upgrades for the rest of bitcoins existance.

Am i missing something?  where is the quote from maxwell accusing purse.io of taking 300k from bitmain in lue for asicboost support?  where is proof that purse.io did not receive 300k?
