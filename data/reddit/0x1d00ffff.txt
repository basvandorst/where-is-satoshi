NSA has a history of messing with hardware to collect intelligence (see [here]( It is also fairly easy to check your own hardware (see [here](

You are right about the fees increasing faster than expected, but adding data to blockchain is expensive - that is the nature of proof-of-work. 
The ~3 tx/s limit is quite low compared to any of the credit card processing companies, so scaling the transaction limit in a linear way is not practical. Sure, bigger blocks means more tx/s, but you would need ~600MB blocks to match Visa's volume. 80GB per day? That's laughably inefficient. 
It makes much more sense to add another layer on top (similar to how every other tech problem is solved) rather than expanding layer 1 to fit every use case. If the first layer is simple and robust, fancy features can be built on top using the guarantees it provides.
Sorry for formatting; on mobile. Also please let me know if my numbers are off. I did double check though.

The S1 uses a little over 400 watts at 12 volts. That doesn't give you a whole lot of options. Besides a standard PSU, I can think of two:
- A car battery (will provide a lot more than 400W, keeping it charged is another issue though)
- A bunch of 12V wall warts (don't do this, most provide ~1 amp so you'd need around 35 in parallel)

You are completely correct. Reading that again I didn't make my first point very well. What I was trying to say is that adding data to the blockchain is expensive (to the people who maintain it) in non-monetary ways. It is a single ledger that everyone shares, and is the de-facto record of trust. When you send a tx, everyone maintaining the network needs to do a little work because of it. 
Regarding the throughput limit, yes, it is completely artificial. On purpose. Raising the limit to a higher artificial level will do nothing to reduce the price of on-chain transactions in the long run. Do you think that even a 100 tx/s limit on the blockchain will be enough to clear the mempool if bitcoin becomes widely adopted? Sure, no one argues that increasing the block size is a scaling solution. It's just a poor one.

The most underrated advice in this thread. Use common sense to avoid opening yourself to targeted attacks.
