Nothing is wrong with the prices; just for someone my age hard to get into BTC.

Didn't realise, any way I can edit the URL to be just the site then?

Seriously man, with board and travel to college 120$ around £90 is a lot of money to me. Hopefully I can get hold of one or smaller amount soon and begin my journey. 
Question: Is there any sites like GBLSE anymore?

Haha it was fun while it lasted :). Didn't seem to go anywhere and compared to actual paid professionals I had a long way to go. School seemed sensible at the time, boring but sensible :)

Ahh thank you very much but how do I receive the tip? My balance is still 0 hmmm

Quite hard to do when you have no income.

There would need to be some reward for the winner otherwise no gain and no incentive to play the game. Otherwise seems fun and probably would become addictive!

Why if I have utilities in my name, I have electricity in my name? Will this cause a problem?

Hey thanks for this, didn't know that subreddit existed. Putting my PS3 up on there now :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:56:52
Aye, hopefully if I can land a part-time job that fits with school then I can maybe save up for one. Would be nice to see Hashrates over 40 :D

Wow thank you man. Didn't know you could do stuff like that. Much love &lt;3
