I agree... financial attacks are well underway with CME and bakkt derivatives active while at the same time no (real asset based) ETF have yet been accepted...

You are wrong... bitcoin network is nothing but a giant battery... It is actually quite good ecologically...
Miners use electricity to "produce"  bitcoins in places where there is an excess of energy (geothermic in island, solar in deserts, hydro in china,...). In other words, that energy would just be wasted/unused otherwise (that is why electricity is cheap over there and mining is profitable).
Electricity is very difficult to store in large quantity and quite difficult to transport over long distance...
and as long as it is the case,  bitcoin allows us to store and transport energy over long distance and duration via its financial properties.

Bitcoin controlled downward pressure will continue until Warren and Sanders are out of the race... then after the election, the crisis we are in right now, will be allowed to unfold (no more free money for bankrupt banks)
This will create panics and in turn multiply the price of crypto assets: the whole crypto market will reach 10 trillions...  so expect a nice 2021 (but not yet in 2020)

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. (M.Gandhi)
This is just the "fight you" stage. 
Bitcoin is still too small in terms of market cap, for them to prevent the next bubble...

Most important sub I ve seen so far. Thanks!
I believe at some point some altcoins will disconnect from btc and grow so much in usage, that either the banks propel the store of value narrative and push btc higher (because it is not a real competitor of their own digital currencies) or they are going to lose much more... gold and silver have no competition... but the cryptospace is growing and bringing new tools at such a fast pace, than suppressing btc could soon become a very bad idea for banks.
Just support good altcoins now... and keep your btc preciously.

Why bitcoin is like asking why facebook... 
Other attempts have existed before it, better ones have been provided after its success... yet when it appeared, it had this set of unique properties (scarcity, transactibility, stockability,...)  that were so appealing that adoption ensued naturally...  and thanks to the network effect, it has become unstoppable.

If major economies hold on to an asset (generally to protect their economy in case of crisis)... be it gold or bitcoin... it would be a very dangerous game for that country to liquidate that asset... because the risk of losing hard assets at a good price is bigger than the probability of creating instabilities in other countries... France sold a lot of gold around 2000 (probably impacting its price) but good luck to get it back now... and unfortunately for them, gold could be dearly needed sooner than later
