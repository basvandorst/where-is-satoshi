don't joking here is that a real threat?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:48:20
but as you can see there is a one already
and the mining won't have proplems? such as the QC will have mostly 100% of the hashrate?

Ty Very Much

i know that segwit didn't change the size limit and the size will be under 1mb that we have been told

as i'm aware don't know if it's true but what i know is quantum computer is unlimited so even how much the difficulty rise it can solve a block in seconds
i'm right?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:27:11
but what about mining?
will it have the most hashrate and do whatever it want?
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:38:20
ty really for response
but sorry because my weak knowledge but i think this is just some words on paper is there a code waiting for such event will do these things?
and how to protect from a quantum computer have mostly all the hashrate

and plz i want the proof to give it to that one who told me
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:39:30
