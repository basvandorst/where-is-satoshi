I woukdnt call it broken until we have a clear and firm close below 6 on the daily. Right now it just looks like a test.

Btc/usd on a major broker is my wet dream.

Thats not a bottom though that is a retracement after a large move. After large moves like the one we just saw the market will retrace some and consolidate before moving further in another direction.

I bet you had fun though.

What time frame are you bullish? Dont blow your account picking a bottom on a year long downtrend.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:05:28
Who in there fucking right mind risks 5 percent of there net worth on a hunch?!?!?! Dude your better off playing roulette!  BTC/USD has broken every major resistance so far and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. At least wait for an established bottom before you assume a position that huge.

As long as there is the human element of buying and selling there will be similarities in the actions of the market participants.

Outlook may still be bullish but decreasing volume is typically indicative of the inverse.
