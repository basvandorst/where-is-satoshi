Does this mean that if it now shows up confirmed in the recipient's wallet with several confirmations/gaining more now, and searching his wallet shows there being the btc there, that after 72 hours, it could disappear from their wallet and need to be sent again? Very important question with regards to how I deal with this lol I definitely don't want any awkward scenarios with disappearing coins!
Also, great username!

This isn't at all a complaint about the bitcoin or electrum developers or the Circle staff (I was referring to their call center hours when I said they were closed but they did reply to the ticket request I later filed and were very helpful and the btc cleared very shortly thereafter) and it was not meant to spread any FUD. A lot of people are using bitcoin and still have only a very vague understanding of what's even going on when they use it. Sometimes, things don't go as planned and people panic and think a transaction got stuck and do stupid things trying to rescue themselves from their perceived predicament and without knowing what they're doing, only to add to their own confusion.
Anyway, to add some closure to the story, everything went OK in the end.

I know but my problem might be bigger than that right now. I'm not even sure where my transaction history and my coins are at the moment, if I should sweep again because of th unknown -425 unconfirmed, or what?
edit: and it was at 2 hours, 30 minutes when I swept.

I tried to sweep and my whole transaction history disappeared on electrum. I only have this right now which isn't showing up in my wallet that I was trying to transact and I'm not sure what's going on or what to do. Can someone with electrum/blockchain experience help me?

Recommendations, please. I seriously think I'm going to switch now.

I have another problem :/ I swept my wallet to try and double-spend the transaction and send again but now, none of my transactions are posting.

That's actually what I'm using. It's all resolved now but it was an issue with the Circle-to-Electrum transaction not confirming and being used for another transaction, making that get stuck as well.

Update: I swept again, and it gave me back my btc. Tried transacting again and it showed that a number of btc are now unconfirmed again but shows no transaction in my transaction history and no receiving address. What's going on?

Yeah, everything went through now. I'm gonna delete the posts since people are replying thinking I'm still having this problem.

I'm not even having the transactions broadcast at this point. I have another issue and the miner's fee pricing was set to do it automatically.
