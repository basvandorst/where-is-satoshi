I am aware.  Did you think I meant our government alone even though it could do it but there’s nothing tangible there I just have a hard time believing it’s like Fort Knox

A wise move is to invest your money into something that cannot be denied of having value.  For those of you that think it’s the wave of the future—- and I’m not making fun of anybody because I was there as well— I feel bad for you but if you’re reading this you know.  everything you hear is never all truth you need to weed out the bullshit to find the truth and when you do then you’ll say “what the fuck am I doing!”

is it possible for one to still mine bitcoins with several powerful CPUs with powerful processors- graphics cards etc.?
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:29:54
I totally disagree with that but I respect your opinion.  bitcoin as we know it has proven to be unstable at best.  it's a gamble and people out there do you know the outcome but we will never know it
