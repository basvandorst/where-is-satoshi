Except everything you literally just said is false? And grammatically incorrect. Don't spread fud, especially if you cant remain coherent without insulting someone else's intelligence.
Also none of what you said constitutes a bug. An example of a bug: Sending a valid transaction and the network rejecting that transaction.

I did read the article. The title itself doesn't have much to do with the articles contents, and the article itself doesn't really prove any factual point. It boils it down to "there is no block size cap so scaling is not possible" which is a part of what sharding aims to solve. The point is lost on the readers because there really isn't one, but then its blamed on the readers?
At what point does it stop a misunderstanding on the readers part, and just poor writing?

And bitcoin isn't? Bitcoin tx take 15+min (and sometimes won't even go through). Eth is less than 5 and always will. Bitcoin and Eth suffer from mining pool centralization. It's not just an ETH problem. That's where PoS/PoW and Sharding come in (again, and ETH innovation, not BTC)
Your second sentence doesn't even make sense. Soooooo...

Can make actual points so you turn to insults?
No longer with my time. Have a good day!

This could also mean someone with a lot of money just set up a new rig?

Maaaaakes sense! ��

Lmfao so childish. What a waste of my intelligence trying to debate this with you.
Great counter point tho. Really shows your level of maturity ��

If you prefer apple to microsoft there is something wrong here... apple is by and large a much worse company than microsoft in almost every regard. At least ms appears to support the oss community. Apple didn't even want to participate in the OpenAI project. Everything apple does is for apple and no one else.

ICOs aren't a use case of the Ethereum network, they are a byproduct. And yes, most all ICOs are doomed to fail. The ethereum community already understands this.
What's new?

Tell me, what do you know about ETH? Because its far from finished. One could argue it's in a MUCH better place in the cryptosphere.
Bitcoin attracts investors because its popular in the eye of the media.
Ethereum attracts developers AND investors because it is designed to breed innovation in the space.
You cant have much of a future without developers to innovate!

That first video looks interesting, I will have to watch it when I have the moment.
As for that article, it's wrong, sort of. The only thing has has reached 1TB is if you are running a historical mode, which is pointless unless you run a service like etherscan. The chain size is actually only about 70gb. Vitalik has a great explanation on it here:


No, and no one *should* do that. The number you want is a parity node run with `parity --no-warp`.


That depends; in ethereum land we don't really talk about "the blockchain". There is:
* **History size**: the combined size of the blocks in the chain, from genesis to present. This is ~37 GB.
* **State size**: the total size of the current state, ie. account balances, contract storage and code. This is ~5 GB.
* **State-tree-pruned node size**: the total storage of a node that stores the history and the current state, but not historical state (historical state can be reconstructed from history, so this isn't actually throwing away data in any information theoretic sense). This is ~70 GB (not 42 GB because of database overhead and the need to store historical receipts and state tree intermediate data).
* **Archive node size**:  the total storage of a node that stores the history and the current state and all historical states, plus intermediate state tree nodes for the history. This is something that basically no one actually needs to store; it's basically a list of "here Bob had 5 coins, then he had 7 coins, then he had 4 coins..." plus O(log(n)) overhead of hash data that could be used to create Merkle proofs of any of these historical states. If you have a pruned node, and you want to get any of this data, you could just recompute it by reprocessing the blockchain. This is now over 1000 GB."
Sharding is not a pipedream, but a very real concept. You can learn all about the awesome work the devs are doing at ethresear.ch
