Any intention to legalize Bitcoin is a step in right direction! Especially if this is intention of Nigerian Bankers Committee. Nigerian people invented a special kind of letter. Do you remember 'Nigerian letters', dudes? They actualy need new tools for their hard and difficult work.

It is a speculation, nothing more. Well structured and well 'grounded' but it is just a meaning of one person. Clever and informed person with a solid background. But just human being :-)
Nobody knows what will be with any rate (price) in future. Why 1300 is some magic rate? Why not 1320? 1275? 1230? 1680?

Yes, they will! Nigerian people respect law. BTC is not legalized yet so they can't tell you this right now. But soon!

I don't want to talk about price. Nothing is impossible except it is impossible to predict future price of any asset. Or just predict future.
I'm totally agree with you, the tech moves very fast. And it will not be a big surprise to see even tomorrow Bitcoin-protocol to be hacked (destroyed and so on). Or dethroned.
You - as an investor - must accept that. Just stay calm and don't allow that probability destroy your mind and your life.
And keep you coins in your own wallet :-) The paper edition of wallet :-)

Would you recommend some more useful resources? For basic level. At the moment I've got just a main idea what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:48:41
Aha! If I've got correct meaning, nothing drastic is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:47:48
Have you already seen all those lessons about Bitcoin? Are they really  worth to watch?
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:16:46
You're awesome!

Great advice, thanks a lot :-)
There are a lot of people discussing this stuff all day and night, you're certainly right. And most of them has no knowledge about the matters they talking (writing) about.
I'm looking for trusted sources of info.
At this moment I can say that William Mougayar, Brian Armstrong, Laura Shin are trustworthy people. Just as an example.
