Look to "Common Carrier" rulings and precedent.
Essentially, if the ISPs want to remove themselves from neutrality, they open themselves up to be liable for all content/data that is transported over their lines.
SUE THEM into oblivion for anything even remotely illegal or injurious that travels through their non-neutral channels.
That's the answer.  
That's how we fight back.

Fine point, but I still find fluid dynamics of a sun to be highly chaotic.
Chaotic systems are such whether based on simple laws or not.  
Predicting chaotic systems is not necessarily based on the laws of operation.  It is based on the numerical results.  Data, and how you transform it.  That is all.
This is why there exists a growing list of quantum physicists and numerical analysts "making bank" on the markets (or at the very least paid to develop predictive systems for hedge funds and the like).

I'm happy the giant robber barons that compose the major current financial institutions have already resigned themselves to a kind of, "if you can't beat them, join them", position to defend against cryptofinancial offerings.
They don't realize they've already lost.  But I'm glad they aren't attacking the technology more directly.

{Mesh nets.}
And, if even a megabyte of illegal or damaging content is proven to be transmitted by a non-neutral ISP (e.g., Verizon, Comcast, etc.), that ISP may then be held liable.
{I envision CEOs being prosecuted for pedophilia after a few pictures are allowed to be transmitted through their non-neutral wires.}
In the same way they can't stop a torrent, there is no way they can censor all illegal or damaging content.  That means that whatever remains/persists may be used as a weapon against them.
P.S. - {Advanced mesh nets.}

I believe this, and I used to mine on Ghash (late last year).
I recognize that mining is an uphill battle, and the best advantage you can have is with renewable energy.  
Trying to squeeze extra dimes and nickles out of a few more merge-mined coins or reduced variance is the desperation of greed.  Greed is an emotional response to fear.  Fear tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Although there are many things going on with the market (e.g., the U.S. Fed upcoming major coin sell-off, continued annoying China news, etc.), there is a strong correlation between GHash reaching 50% and a major sell-off.
In fact, I was anticipating that XBT would be over $700 by the end of next week.  Not now.
Miners bills and most other expenses are in fiat.  Even if their shortsighted greed wasn't 100% to blame, contributing to GHash's network dominance does appear to result in a major decline in Bitcoin price, and therefore the miners won't make as much of a profit.
It's pretty obvious to me.

I think the point is that no appcoins have shown themselves to be fully legitimate and also so ground breaking that either bitcoin or a component of its ecosystem could itself provide.
I'm a fan of diversity, but all I see with appcoins is trash-scam.  Pre-mined crap (and I've been in on early mining for some coins).  Nothing sustainable.  Nothing as disruptive as Bitcoin originally was (and remains).  Nothing close.
There are projects I've liked (e.g., Darkcoin, Storj, etc.), and even those fall short in my eyes.  
I'm always left wondering, "Why didn't they just do this with Bitcoin instead of making a new coin?"  The answer always points to a desire of the originators to cash out and make it rain.

DeadTerra failed at IceDrill.  Miserably.  And re-invested funds that IceDrill investors had provided to strictly pay for actual hashing power instead on shares of a single firm: HashFast.
HashFast in now bankrupt, and he had no qualms or concerns about putting all his eggs in one basket, like a gambler with a lot of money to burn (i.e., "Bet it all on black!").  Only, it wasn't his money: it was investors' money.
If you trust your money with him, trust him to gamble it away on some scheme or the first opportunity he gets.

I'm fine with that.  In the end, the giant financial behemoths will bury themselves in regulation that was originally intended to support their control and manipulation of currency/finance.
I believe we will find that anything pushing smaller players out of the cryptofinancial sector will only have the affect of making other locales more competitive.  I highly doubt one State's regulation, or even restrictive Federal regulation, will have any real impact on eliminating independent financial services.  I also doubt it will even be a real threat.

I'm also going to post the original AMA that magically got banned as soon as the [OP]( posted the name of the firm that hired him (see his history for the answer - google results in nothing on the firm):














One day I was literally on the verge of just giving up when an excoworker called me up and said she was no longer working at the startup we were at. She had started a new company and believed I was well suited to join ranks with her.




























The Chrome extension would tell us where to go. It didn't contain a direct link as apparently reddit will counter with shadow bans for that sort of behavior. It would simply tell us the links to follow to get where we needed to be. Basically it would say something like "Reddit &gt; Bitcoin &gt; New &gt; Thread Title" and a check box once we had completed our task.

Like your 5?!  Man.....I specialize in clarity, not simplicity.
Any internet data transport corporation (i.e., ISP) was previously protected from the liability of any illegal and/or injurious content because the ISP was considered a neutral data transport agent.
The moment an ISP chooses to sort, prioritize, or otherwise nullify their neutral position will also be the moment they leave themselves open to liability for the entire content of data they transport.
Packets have signatures.  Data that has been transported can have signature gathered.  If illegal or otherwise damaging data gets transported through non-neutral service providers, that service provider may be sued for liability (or worse).

We're still here.
Personal issues with the core developers (e.g., family health catastrophe, etc.) and lack of resources (few system developers with C expertise, only app developers) have pushed us to take a step back again.
We aren't too worried about it, however.  Few others have enough vested interest to be concerned.  If you hear from us in the future, it will be with code and at least one working Proof of Concept backing our proposal up.
We need a lot of work.  We tried to involve the community, but each time has been met with essentially drama and no real community contribution (i.e., it seems to drag us down).  We don't want to spend a lot of time on documentation when the code itself has the framework for the solution.  Clearly the White Paper needs a complete re-write, but that won't happen until after the PoC.
And it's not "proof of bandwidth" anymore.  It's "Proof of Service".

The reason I find it important is the following:
- OP can still be seen posting, but none of his responses show up after having mentioned the firm that paid him.
- Shilling social media is a known tactic of intelligence agencies and other institutions of control.
- All the comments that say OP is a liar have large number of upvotes, yet anyone that mentions even the possibility of the story being possible is heavily downvoted.
- Deletion is possible with a heavily "reported" post, and this kind of agency would easily have that in their power.

The synch protocol has a preliminary set of operations and instructions, but we are still writing the patent application.  Therefore, until intellectual property (IP) has been secured for the FOSS community, we don't want to release it.
In fact, locking town the property for public domain, precluding any kind of proprietary stifling of the technology, is what we have been working on in advance of code.
Why would we do this?  Because there have been historical cases where open source technology has been countered (and essentially killed) by proprietary ownership of the invention.

Besides accountt1234's comment (which I find to be solid), there are also plenty of bitcoin payment services that offer off-the-chain payment transactions if you hold coin with them (e.g., Coinbase).
So, for example, a business that has payment through Coinbase can receive payment from a Coinbase user without any activity visible on the blockchain.
