No, buy a number. A number that is indirectly referenced by a ledger, and which is hard to guess.

@_date: 2014-03-28 07:08:52


That's false logic. False logic which people apply to all sorts of stuff, houses, stocks, etc. But it's false.
You price your liquid assets at the most recent market price. Doing anything else makes no sense.


'If', not 'once'. Or you will be rewarded with having wasted all your money if it never does jump back up.
Also quite likely in case of BTC (this pseudo-money which isn't used as money because people like you just hoard it hoping to find a bigger fool to sell it to).
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:04:38

If $6B of fiat is lost, there is some chance of tracing it. With $6B of BTC there is much less chance of it.

@_date: 2014-04-10 21:47:58
Well, the primary reason for the downtrend is that BTC is basically 'magic internet something that people speculate with but don't actually use as money'. That's not bound to change any time soon BTW.

That's, like, one guy's opinion. Unsubstantiated opinion.
Bitcoin is dropping because it's not fulfilling its promises. 
Too much mining needs to happen to enable transfers, burning too much electricity. The cost of transfers / payments is high, and not in any way better or cheaper than, say, paypal. Just more complex.
The dream of "get rich quick and easy" of many (including many here on this subreddit) is over, the nightmare continues.
This is why Bitcoin will keep falling.
If you like money, you should sell now.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:58:20

Should I care whether my neighbour gambles away his money to a point where the government has to come in and provide him with food stamps, thus spending my tax money?
Some questions to think about, e.g., in the context of what effect the actions of others have on us all.
But in any case, even if somebody has the right to gamble away his money on whatever stupid endeavours, I in turn have the right to call these actions stupid.

I'm quite sure I can transfer $6M for ~$10 flat commission fee using my bank. 
Unfortunately I don't have $6M to test it out on, but they charge a flat fee even for international transfers, not a percentage.
The problem with dealing with $6M in bitcoins is that trying to buy or sell that much would significantly affect the fiat price. Selling that much might even start another panic sell-off. In the end you'd lose way way more than the 3.5% they list.
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:01:37


Suppose I know something that, when made public, will likely bring BTC price down, let's say, $5, because I'm an "insider". 
Suppose you don't know it.
Suppose BTC trades at $80 on Mt Gox.
Suppose I sell you one BTC at $80, then announce the news.
Price falls to $75.
You have instantly lost $5, while I have gained them.
That is the transfer of wealth.
Is that illegal? Not really, there are no laws covering this.
Is it bad? Not for me. It is for you, but of course you may not notice it so don't get the opportunity to be angry.
For the market? Possibly, if enough people understand that this is what is happening on a regular basis they may be less inclined to invest. But likely they don't, so it doesn't matter.

The DJIA went from 14697.79 to 14566.94 to 14685.74, which is a 0.9% drop that lasted 6 minutes.

@_date: 2013-06-09 18:47:37
Or it could be strangled by regulation/legislation and replaced by something else. And then the price could go from $100 to $0. That is actually more likely than it going to $2M.
Think of one thing - do the people with the money now really want to give tons of it to the early adopters to BTC (by boosting its price through to it becoming widely used)? 
No, they don't, so when BTC gets on their radar, expect even more hurdles.
@_date: 2013-10-14 10:08:48
An endorsement from a crazy person. Nice.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:33:52
Banks do way more than transfer money. I may be missing something, but most of the problems that bitcoin claims to address would be better classified as "getting rid of PayPal / Skrill / Neteller". 
Which is a nice goal, as their fees are quite high, however - I don't find, for example, bitpay's fees that low, and also sort of think that bitcoin's volatility needs to tone down a lot before the general public is ready to use it instead of PayPal.
And speaking of banks, the main problem IMHO is that they grow too big to fail and too exposed to each other, and thus instead of failing are bailed out. This incentivizes risk-taking.
So paradoxically more regulation would be better there than less.
P.S. If you hope to do away with fractional reserve banking simply by using bitcoins then I think that's overly optimistic. But maybe I've missed a memo.
@_date: 2013-07-30 07:31:45
Well, if you had bought with Paypal or a bank card or in most other fiat ways except cash on hand, you might have an easier time recovering it. Something to think about.
In the meantime, cannot you still sue them? 150 BTC isn't chump change.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:20:44
Cheap or expensive with Bitcoin is very relative, they are worth what other people think they are worth, and other people keep changing their mind about it.
At the moment bitcoins are not very good as a currency (too volatile), not very good as a store of value (crash too often, hard to secure for a technically unsophisticated person) and probably still doesn't have enough infrastructure for a layman to transfer money using them efficiently and securely.
So it's not clear why they ought to be worth anything at all. 
But of course there are plenty of people who think / hope / expect them to be worth something, hence the ~$550 price we are seeing right now.
How many of these people only try to convince others about them being 'cheap' due to a vested interest? Something to think about.
@_date: 2013-10-04 11:00:16
Yep, bitcoin is kind of like gopher.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:50:39


Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
There is no reason to think that after experiencing a period of extreme volatility bitcoin price will suddenly stabilize. 
If anything this shows how ridiculously volatile BTC are.

Actually I didn't say if I thought they were shady or not.
On the other hand, their website doesn't really inspire confidence. Too many broken links, not enough details about how they manage the funds being processed. 
What happens when during the time somebody uses N bitcoins to pay for $100k in purchases but before they've sold these bitcoins and paid the merchant the $100k bitcoin falls 50%? Do they have sufficient funds to cover this eventuality? Maybe. Maybe not.
Are they SEC regulated? Likely not or they would declare on the website. What happens when SEC wakes up about bitcoin and says - these websites are all running unauthorized payment processing / financial services / what not; we shut them down. What happens if you're the merchant at that point being owed $100k from BitPay? What happens if you are the customer having sent $100k worth in BTC to the merchant that the merchant hasn't received yet?


All of the things you list about them applied, to, say, Bernard Madoff at one point. That's not to say BitPay is the same as Madoff, they are probably a (at least semi-)legitimate business trying to make a living as opposed to a Ponzie schemer. However, that just illustrates how the things you list are if not irrelevant, then at least insufficient to state whether something is shady or not.
You have made money from bitcoins. Good for you. You have a vested interest in bitcoins. Good for you.
But I hear hype in what you write. We'll see how it works out for you. At least in the mid-term, buying into hype hasn't worked out so well for those who were late to the party, buying at $270.

Still much more rare and with a much better outcome (83% recovery rate) than a hacked bitcoin wallet.

Some on this subreddit seem to think the DDoSes were the reason why the fall from $250 to $50 happened - which would be a 80% drop (and quite a bit more substantial than the $15 drop you mention).
It takes quite some skill to spin any sort of news as positive for bitcoins, but people here are very proficient at it.
Gold gaining in price - shows people's lack of confidence in traditional banking and fiat currencies, good for BTC.
Gold falling in price - BTC not affected, good for BTC.
DJIA drops by 0.9% for 6 minutes - "see, the stock markets are also volatile zomg!!!11", good for BTC.
BTC gaining in price - "we'll all be rich, let me invest my student loans!", good for BTC.
BTC stable in price (hypothetically, hasn't happened yet) - that's how a currency should be, increases merchant belief in BTC, good for BTC.
BTC dropping like a rock - "great buying opportunities", good for BTC.
... and so forth. 
P.S. Also another important step to success is to downvote all dissenting opinion. :)

It's an Eastern European bank. Since it is a USD wire, they sent it through USA. It is the USA bank that is demanding the commission from them, and they are keen to pass it on to me.

Well, you could consider most if not all technical analysis as presented on blogs as random spam of buzzwords with little to no basis in reality. 
But then what would you be left with? Not with fundamental analysis as there are no fundamentals for bitcoins.
Quite a dilemma.
Also, I read the following quote in the first blog you mention and found it quite amusing:






The second one is also nice. He basically says "it could go up, but you have to remember it could also go down" in pretty much every post. Add in some stuff about Fibonacci retracements as that sounds so cool and technical and you have a successful blog.
The general rule of thumb is - pretty much no one really can predict anything. No one can predict when some of the early miners decide they want to cash out and dump, pulling the price down. No one can predict when another Winklevoss brothers appear and decide to buy.
And if they could predict that, it would make way more sense to just trade on that information rather than post it on some blog.

To take this to a hyperbole, you would be okay if parties related to Al Qaeda would make a massive short of US airplane stocks on the evening of 9/10 and thus earns many millions of dollars based on their insider knowledge? You'd let them withdraw any such proceeds no questions asked?
After all, you are perfectly okay that some people (Al Qaeda leadership) have more knowledge than you in certain areas of life (where the next act of terror will happen).
(of course this is likely not covered by current insider trading regulations, but whatever)

This appears to be pure conjecture, why isn't Simon posting himself? 


I wouldn't rush to blame German fiscal authorities.
More likely Simon didn't follow the many requirements to legally run a business handling huge amounts of other people's money. KYC rules, keeping funds segregated and capital requirements when dealing with something as volatile as bitcoins are first that come to mind. 
So in a sense it was the responsibility of the German authorities to freeze the accounts, especially considering that the software was buggy. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:43:05
Oh, it absolutely will, after a brief period of transfer of wealth from the people without the insider information to the people with it.
After all, the former deserve being taken advantage of for not placing themselves in a sufficiently knowledgeable and powerful situation. 
Kind of like the normal people deserve being taken advantage of by banks and governments for not placing themselves in a sufficiently powerful situation. Oh wait...

Perhaps I'm cynical about corporate announcements but to me it is pretty much the same thing.
In any case, "We were not served nor notified of such a lawsuit" is not the same as "Peter didn't try to deal with Mark by talking to him behind closed doors". 
For example, maybe they did talk, and he did warn Mark that a lawsuit may come at some point, but due to whatever reasons did not specify a specific date. That would let Mark truthfully make the statement he made, but also means that Peter did try to resolve the situation peacefully. 
Of course I don't know what happened. But neither do most people who are not very directly involved with the two companies.

Your position reminds me of this Daily Show snippet:
No law is ever going to be 100% successful, that doesn't mean that 100% of laws are useless.
I'm sure the insider trading laws make it harder for insiders to do their insider trading, and thus, while not eliminating the problem, does alleviate it. 
If that gives you a false sense of security, that's your problem. I'll take that over the alternative.

That's because they've seen a few too many Ponzi schemes, tulip bulb bubbles and so forth, most of which have an eery similarity to bitcoin.

a) Who watches the watchers? If I didn't know how to pick the right security expert, how do I know I pick the right picker of security experts? How do I ensure the security expert picker doesn't just provide me with rankings based on the amount of kickbacks received from the exchanges?
b) Who would the exchanges rather let them audit their code - a number of private auditors or one government agency?
c) What if the exchanges lie to the auditing private entity (e.g. about whether they will gamble with the customers money)? Once that comes to light, don't they have less recourse than the government to actually deal out punishment?
d) There have now been 40+ of exchanges, though 45% have closed operations so far (with quite a bit of the customer's moneys lost). Even more wallets. 
How many "exchange/wallet rating agencies" are there?
e) There are some economies of scale to be had with having less regulators than more.

Getting money back is never easy, it can be more or less hard. I never maintained it is "straightforward".
Just with PayPal (and I hate paying its 2% commission - even if it is hidden by having the vendor pay it - as much as next guy), you have the option to opening a support case and a reasonable chance of getting your money back.
Same with a bank payment, it is easier to prove you paid it, and your bank will sometimes side with you.
All I'm trying to say that if you notice the advantages of BTC (relative anonymity, low commissions), then you shouldn't turn a blind eye to the disadvantages too (one of which is in this case is quite evident). Bitcoin seems almost a religion for some here.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:51:26


So basically to be safe in dealing with Bitcoins I have to be a computer security expert, e-mail any of my wallet and exchange service providers about their security precautions, and then not only evaluate if their answers appear truthful but also make an evaluation on them?
And this guy expects the average Joes to be able to do it?
Sorry, but a large part of the financial regulation is about consumer protection. 
I want to know that the bitcoin services I use keep operational funds segregated from my funds. I want to know they have a reasonable secure software. 
I want to know they aren't likely going bankrupt in the next few days due to regularly gambling with customer funds.
No, I don't have the time to audit them myself, nor are they interested in giving everyone access to do it. And I won't just take their word for it, sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:54:40


Forgive me if I'm missing something, but it appears bitpay will pick some rate at some specific point during the day for the BTC to USD conversion - not necessarily at the time when the payment was received. 
I didn't even find them clearly stating what specific rate (for all we know, it could be the low).
So the user would be exposed at least to intra-day swings which lately have sometimes been ridiculously high.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:52:03


That's where we'll have to agree to disagree. 
I think profiting from this knowledge is also a market distorting action, immoral, and ends up effectively in some sense being theft from the people you trade with.
In the case of the guy who knew about 9/11 we have no laws about it (I think). Such laws would be near impossible to write/enforce too.
However, in case of the CFO who has found out that the bank is no longer extending his companies credit line and that this will lead to his company's bankruptcy (but he can personally make an immense profit by short selling), we do have the laws and should keep them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:50:34


The phrasing on their website is not very clear; by "accept bitcoins, as a form of payment" appears to mean that the merchant gets bitcoins from the transaction.
But in case they get USD, that's obviously better.
Now the bitcoin user can indeed worry about the fluctuations (and worry he should).
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:21:29
Well, if only there was an actual valid reason for BTC to be worth $250 / $110 / $67 / $5 / whatever.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:45:58
$250 for you is just an arbitrary number. As valid as $2.5 or $0.25.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:58:50


Yeah, instead of that he has to worry his bitcoins will drop from $270 to $60 by the time he manages to cash them out. 
That will surely motivate him to accept them.
P.S. Regular bank transfers (so-called standing orders) are common for rent payments in many countries, and have next to no risks compared to checks and bitcoins.

My experience has been good with them so far, but I've heard similar stories about PayPal/eBay.
But would PayPal have solved the issue in OP's case? I don't know for sure, but it seems quite likely.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:03:18
There are the hundreds of inventions that were hyped but never took off. Those are not on the list, since OP is cherry-picking.
For example:
The key difference here is that in case of most of these inventions, it is mostly the company producing the product that is interested in promoting it. In case of bitcoins, anyone who mined some or bought any is interested to promote it, hence the abundance of wishful thinking and hype.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:32:18
Fundamentals. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
There are no fundamentals for bitcoins. It is purely virtual, and its price is completely based on investor (speculator?) sentiment, which as we see is quite flaky.
For a stock, fundamental analysis is useful as perhaps it shows that the company is generating sufficient profit per share that it will provide a decent return whether through price increases or dividends and therefore is a good buy. 
No such thing for bitcoins, the only profits it will generate are if you find someone who is willing to pay more for it than you paid. Nothing fundamental about that.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:13:07
People buy bitcoins for the reason of:
a. Sending them to other people (who may then immediately sell them)
b. As an investment (and since it is a profit/interest non-generating asset, it is basically pure speculation)
The portion of people in category b. was way way way larger than the portion of people in category a. for a long time. Now that suddenly the speculators are no longer that confident in their investment, the category b. is shrinking, and they are selling.
This will continue until either the speculators again regain their confidence in Bitcoin, or the group a. expands significantly.
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:49:33
I agree with you that there is no reason such a service would be impossible to sell to people. However, that doesn't make it more or less efficient than centralized government regulation.
I mostly just disagree with the original post that all centralized regulation is about political favouritism and not about customer protection. It is usually about both.

Good idea, getting burnt on one bubble, and jumping on to the next one as it is deflating.




Ah, you believe in the fundamentals of something that is purely virtual and has no fundamentals.

Bitcoin is relatively easy to use in an unsecure manner for a technologically competent person.
But to use it securely - so that both the wallet is hard to hack and you are unlikely to lose it through hard drive failure or something is quite difficult IMHO.
If you don't agree, try pointing the average person to  and see the reaction.
In any case, people still fall for Nigerian scam letters and catch computer trojans / viruses all the time. If bitcoin ever becomes mainstream, the amount of funds stolen and scammed away will be staggering.
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:40:57
There is nothing wrong with that comparison. Both are methods of sending money online. Both are methods of paying for goods and services.
That's like saying you cannot compare desktop computers with laptops as you can transport laptops more easily. Well, both are used for running applications, so you can compare them.
You Bitcoin fanatics would do well to understand that the average user doesn't care about implementation details, he doesn't care about blockchains and transaction signing and all the other important technical concepts. 
He only cares about paying for whatever he has to buy, and in that sense bitcoin are clearly competing with paypal and bank cards.

Bitcoin has no fundamentals. There is no real reason why it should be valued at $5 vs $75 vs $200. It's whatever the market thinks, and markets are very volatile in their thinking.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:59:08
You are spot on. 
This whole subreddit is basically full of fanatics who are reinforcing each others' wildest dreams about how BTC will take over the world and they will all be rich.
While in some ways it is a nice dream (e.g., my bank just attempted to charge me $300 for transferring USD to another bank in the same country), fanaticism driving investment decisions is probably going to end badly for a lot of those involved.
