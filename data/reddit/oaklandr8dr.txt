Don't know why you're being downvoted. A degree is an investment. If your degree is in a career without a significant financial return, it's logically a bad investment like any other bad investment!
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:49:18
I agree. That's a separate issue. A degree is an investment. If your investment doesn't have good income generation prospects, one should consider alternatives is what I am saying.

Glad you agree. You might be scratching your head here, so let me spell it out - you are completely demolishing your own talking points. A degree and "an education" are mutually exclusive. They are not one in the same and it doesn't take an education to understand that, yet here you are conflating the two as if they are the same.
That's the problem with internet wannbe anarchist revolutionaries. You read one little Chomsky pamphlet and suddenly you think you understand how it all works. Sticking it to the man and the IMF by buying Bitcoin off Gemini LOL that's the sound of my eyes rolling.
By your comment history kid - run some spell and grammar check on your posts and work on that "education" before honking your mindless opinion on the internet.
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:55:53
So you believe going into debt to "have an education" is smart?
The world's knowledge is out there in libraries and the internet for anyone to take. MIT offers a considerable amount of courses fully free online.
If "education" is what you are after there is absolutely zero reason to go into debt.
Your ad hominem doesn't change any of those facts. You don't need to be spoon-fed to "get an education".

I don't see a situation where both gold or bitcoin works except in a non collapse scenario. Gold would be more highly prized in a collapse situation due to the portability, difficulty to counterfeit, and no reliance on electricity. People will be more concerned about bartering in an economic collapse scenario. Folks who think Bitcoin is going to rule the day in a collapse situation aren't thinking about our electrical grid or what it takes to keep the technology (least of all mining in a POW coin) situation going.

Suppose fiat does collapses. Would you rather have a Bitcoin or a stockade of supplies for bartering? If adoption of crypto currency is not mainstream, a death wish to fiat is stupid frankly. People will barter before they accept Bitcoin in that scenario.
The intelligent thing to do as people said is dip the toe. Diversification of risk is also intelligent and that does not entail note than a single digit percentage of your total net worth into Bitcoin.
Also everybody looks like a genius in hindsight. Why didn't you go all in on Apple or Amazon stock when it was cheap!?

It's very horrible. My wife tried to sign up for a coins.th account and they keep denying her without explanation because she can't show a Thailand source of income even though she's providing her Thai ID to the website and a Thailand address. My guess is they are so paranoid, they won't accept "husband income" or consider it KYC/AML risk they don't want to deal with.

It's up to them decide what is honest in lieu of actual information, but no penalities should be assessed for good faith efforts. If you got audited you'd have to explain yourself and the method you used to guess the cost basis rather than take zero.
They might change your tax due and disagree with your method, but you will not get penalized or owe interest on a good faith attempt.
Most likely scenario is they will estimate if there is a material effect anyway. If there's no money to be made, they'll move on. A few thousand dollars is not worth for example, putting a full on crypto currency audit expert on the case.
If we are talking hundreds of thousands or millions, then yes you'll get a visit and they'll did deeper. But if you made a honest attempt with what you have available, no penalities.
It's about materiality honestly. I am dealing with a client who has seven figure problems and not all of his records. A good faith attempt will be the best we can do and we will decide how much to dig in our heels when the tax man cometh.

Oh then a CPA is not much different than a Charter Accountant and some of my advice about the EA goes right out the window.
In this case your first stop is a CA familiar with crypto and then a lawyer.
Sorry I was speaking from an American perspective on the matter. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:50:01
Tough call. The accountant won't magically be able to guess much better than you - and will bill you considerably to come up with something too. I would always advise though if you do not know what you're doing to visit a professional.
In terms of the cost yes, they'll look it up but the trade information you provide and timing will mostly be the honor system at that point. So that's the key point - if they believe your reconstructed trade information. If your exchange data is lost forever, they kind of have to believe you. They might request subsequent data just to look at your volume of trading and verify if your recreation is reasonable.
Not familiar with UK tax system at all, but I would imagine they are looking at it similar to the USA.

Yea I don't see somebody doing machine learning and AI 100% self taught in their basement.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:51:11
The moral of the story it is a little intentionally vague, but the IRS will negotiate with you, your CPA/EA, or lawyer on what you should owe without penalty as long as "good faith" effort was put in to prove out the cost basis.
Given the difficulty in tracking cost basis in crypto sometimes... There are some methods that may or may not reasonable.
My two cents as a professional is bottom line: file and pay something so your SOL kicks in.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:40:35
Not completely the same. A CPA would knowledgeable about the hands on process of accounting and preparing taxes. A tax attorney would be familiar with matters of tax court which may or may not include IRS negotiating. There is a third option enrolled agent.
In my professional opinion, I would use a CPA to file my taxes and if there was disagreement, I would search out an EA Enrolled Agent with actual IRS experience as an agent. Those EAs usually have contacts on the inside to reach a compromise quickly and their rates are fair.
Tax attorney would probably be my last recourse if you wish to take the matter to court outright. Lawyers are by the most expensive and least hands on.

Who said anything about ACTUALLY building a self driving car? You didn't literally believe I meant getting a GPU farm together and then on top of that actually BUILDING a car, did you?
My first comment had to do with machine learning and AI... DEVELOPING (meaning code) of what it takes to do a self driving car (deep learning). CODE.
The premises is that there are few self taught AI and machine learning developers out there.... Not that costs of freaking building a self driving car are prohibitive... That is FAIRLY obvious, would you not agree?

A CPA *is* an accountant, a certified public accountant. Preferably one who is an expert on crypto taxes.
Don't know where you are but if you happen to be anywhere near upstate New York, there is one guy I can highly recommend.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:05:55
If your tax lawyer or CPA provides you make a "good faith" estimate, you can at least avoid penalities.
In terms of stock, that situation does comes up where the original documentation has been lost but you roughly know when the stock was purchased. Perhaps 20 or so stock splits and various things happened in-between the initial purchase that makes calculation of the cost basis murky... Perhaps you bought the stock in the 1970s and it was rolled over from one brokerage to another and the original information is lost.
Cases like this you must attempt to make a best guess and it's unreasonable to just put $0.
IRS will GLADLY though take your tax money on a $0 basis sale with NO fight!
Evaluate your situation on a case by case basis.
