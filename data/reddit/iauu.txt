Bitcoin is an open source program that can be run by anyone like you and me. It allows you to digitally store money in a secure and private way and send it to any other person in the world instantly as long as they have internet access. This way you can buy, sell and make any kind of transaction peer to peer without intermediaries like banks or costly payment services.
There. I tried to go straight to what it can do keeping it simple and no unnecesary introductions, fancy pitching or tech talk.

95.7% with one bad review means this seller has barely had aroud 21 sales total. 20 'positive' reviews are not much at all and could have even been faked.
Just be careful next time.

You should have kept reading. It was a pretty cool fanfic.

I can just picture him honestly denying that he's the inventor of Bitcoin while the robbers "know" it's him because 'the article said he would deny it'.

Thanks man! You seem worthy. Let's try this 250 bits

I've never received a Bitcoin tip. This will be a great learning experience :)

They say bitcoin is globalized but if you're like me and don't happen to live in a first world country you're stuck with only option A.

Seems like the *Return to the mean* phase to me. Bitcoin already had all that media attention, craze, greed, etc.

Thank you! Any idea how can I search for strings inside these files? Windows only seems to search by file names.
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:29:49
Not at all! Just some personal stuff worth less than $1k.

You're absolutely right that very few (if any) businesses right now accept Bitcoin as is. Which leaves me thinking: Does Bitcoin have any future if almost nobody will take it as payment?
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:20:15
Wow that's pretty awesome!
May I ask how have your Bitcoin experience been so far? Do you have many Bitcoin buyers? Do you keep the BTC or cash out instantly? Do you feel like you could go broke overnight because of this?

20% was just an example for the sake of simplicity. The actual amount can be anything as long as it gives people incentive to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:05:30
Sure, but if enough businesses were to do this, I can't see how more and more people wouldn't want to get Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:07:53
Yeah. I gave it my best in this post to try to come up with a way in which people would actually want to use Bitcoin as currency and not just hold onto/speculate with it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:21:08
Yes but I could argue that you could try charging more USD to reduce risk but that would just scare away customers.
I'm not trying to say every business must accept Bitcoin since not all can because of the current high risk. I'm trying to say that those few (so far) businesses that do accept it could try this as it could potentially make them more money in the long run.

Exactly, until any altcoin comes around that offers new ideas instead of just a few number adjustments over Bitcoin they won't be worthwhile.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:52:41
There is no reason to offer this discount I'm talking about if you wish to cash out instantly to USD. What I'm refering to are the business that actually want receive the BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:33:55
Damn, I've been paying my ISP too much.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:15:25
Well the incentive is that the more people you attract with this, the more value the thing that they are paying you with will have.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:38:54
Yeah, funny how even the tiniest boat could carry all of the Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:49:56
The incentive is that whatever customers pay you right now will be worth more in the future than what you would have received originally in USD.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:10:45
Thank you! It's great hearing from someone who actually went ahead and tried this. I wish you the best of luck on your business.

Well the distance from Earth to Mars varies from 55 million to 400 million km so that means we'll be seeing some mad swings in the future.
