I think theoretically if you aren't using DNSSEC it might be possible to mitm a blockchain explorer API hostname.
Instead of using DNSSEC to get the hostname for the API and then do HTTPS request, you could just use DNSSEC to get the result from dnscoin.nz 
this seems more efficient to me.

I use bitwage, they give you a bank account number which I added to my payroll. When I get a paycheck 10% of it goes to bitwage, they then buy BTC with it at the market rate. Also, I store the BTC on a Trezor hardware wallet and transfer out small amounts to Mycelium on my android phone so that I can spend little amounts online without the Trezor.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:35:43
oh also I forgot, on bitwage site/app you specify your destination bitcoin address. bitwage uses 2 factor authentication and other methods so I am pretty confident that the destination bitcoin address could not be changed without my approval.

@_date: 2016-04-26 14:46:37
its easy, you just provide your KYC info for bitwage and they give you bank account and routing numbers. you use these numbers to set up a direct deposit on your paycheck, just like if you had a second account and some of your money went to a savings account. for my company we have a web portal where I can change my direct deposit info. If you do not have this then your HR department should be able to help, just tell them you have a savings account and give them the routing and account numbers.

I am a network engineer for Time Warner Cable and I want to let everyone know that myself and others controlling the TWC networks are very pro privacy and pro user. We do not mess with Bitcoin in any way, we do not mess with Tor, we do not stop torrents or send download letters. One thing I can think of that is intrusive on privacy is data collection on the DNS servers, but you are free to use any DNS of course. 
I know some people have had bad experiences with cable. Most of those issues are with poor installation jobs causing signal loss issues. Our techs can really vary with technical competency so if you have problems get another tech who can do the proper troubleshooting on line issues. With all these issues I hear about other ISP being intrusive consider giving us a try.

the ram is probably excessive unless you are running a hypervisor and multiple VM for different purposes. if it's a dedicated Bitcoin +lightning node 16GB should be fine.

so basically everytime anyone gets a loan from a back for a car, house, business venture, etc debt is "created". your company may have millions or billions in debt but they make money so its cool as long as everything is constantly expanding. more people, more companies, more products, more debt. you enter a problem when this cycle is slowed or interrupted. see japan. after 2008 when the banks were bailed out from going bankrupt on their risky leveraged derivitives ( basically options built on subprime mortagages grouped together ) we entered unchated territory where the central bank in each country is buying up stocks to keep asset prices up. can this continue forever? who knows, it has never happened this way before this is the twilight zone.
I honestly expect a reset has to occour at some point and maybe cryptocurrencies are the escape hatch for rich people and governments.

hey, I can provide a little insight here as a cloud network engineer. Run Linux (centos 7 preferably) and firewall all ports except SSH and ports for btcd + lnd. secure your btcd RPC user with a complex password and use 127.0.0.1 loopback IP for RPC IP. point the lnd to the btcd RPC on 127.0.0.1
set up this way you have a secure ecosystem of full Bitcoin node and full lightning node on your own Linux system.

genius idea! I guess you could implement this by transmitting the transaction as well as the nonce and hash of the transaction itself separately. kind of like a handshake that the nodes would need to receive the transaction.

I have a theory on what is happening with Bcash and BTC and the current falling tx fee confirms it. The Chinese miners are attempting a hostile takeover of bitcoin, they created BCH and are pumping up the transaction fees on BTC blockchain. Their goal is to drive people away from BTC and onto BCH. At first this doesn't make sense because they could be killing their own profits mining BTC but this may be at the directive of the Chinese government. Currently it is more profitable to mine BCH but this changes frequently because the difficulty algos work differently on the two chains. While they mine BTC it seems they are spending massive amounts on BTC transaction fees and buying BCH with BTC via the korean exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:40:15

this might be true for a futures market where you can take delivery but this will be only cash settled therefore no actual BTC is traded. it's only people betting each other on what the price of Bitcoin will do.
it's more like you betting your neighbor $100 that Bitcoin will hit a certain price by a certain date in the future. Does this affect BTC price? maybe in a really nebulous way but definitely not directly.

the problem with blocksize increases is that it is irreversable. if the blockchain grows at too high of a rate we could end up with scaling issues of another kind. the whole arugment is really contrived because the only reason the mempool is full is because of the miners attacking core and creating their own fork ( BCH )

I got one and used it. Awesome product. You only set the first 4 letters from each seed word (these are unique and determined by the BIP protocol) into the cryptosteel and then lock it down.

yes but what your aren't prepared for is something like the IME or a virus on the hard drive firmware. this could leak your private key or seed onto the internet at any time after your computer is connected. the only way you can be 100% sure is to use an air gapped computer and never connect it to the internet again (destroy it). Alternatively use a second hardware wallet and only enter the recovery on the second hardware wallet. I am a network engineer for a cloud computing company and have experience in this field.

@_date: 2017-12-01 19:36:54
people are misunderstanding how this futures market works. This is cash settled so basically this market is people betting each other in USD on what will happen to the price of Bitcoin. No Bitcoin is being moved or delivered here. For each futures trade there is a counterparty betting USD, not BTC. They measure the price of BTC exchanges and go off that for the market.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:14:19
so you would likely open a payment channel with like $200 with a company like bitpay. they would function like a payment processor and handle disputes and such with the merchants. bitpay would have channels open it all their merchants who accept bitpay and all the other payment processors. this is why lightning is a second layer, for those that know networking this is similar to how IP networking runs on top of Ethernet. Bitcoin would fly around these lightning payment channels and only be settled on chain infrequently (maybe when you need to refill your bitpay account or it runs out?)
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:34:27
I see what your getting at and it might be theoretically possible but nobody has invented this yet. Vitalik has been working on what he calls sharding that is basically what your explaining but they haven't figured it out fully yet. Even beyond that it would have to be mathematically provable before it should be implemented.
 So think about this example how would you make sure the shards all mine at the same rate? If you can't do that then what's to stop someone from making their own Bitcoin block chain that only they mine on and making 1000 BTC and merging that with the main block chain?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:44:10
fuck yes!
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:43:27
I'm not entirely sure a payment processor would be required this is just my imagination at this point. We will see when lightning starts being used and evolves. Maybe you have channels with all the places you frequent like grocers and gas stations.

the blocks will always be full. anyone can spam the mempool with free trasactions, the problem is that now the miners are fighting core and spamming with high fee transactions. I think they are probably beign forced to do this by the Chinese government to attempt to take over bitcoin.

In the US the government does not create money. The Federal Reserve is a private corporation made up of banks that control American money creation. It is not under the control of any branch of the US government and recently refused a request from Congress to provide information on its meetings and members. It was started in 1913 by a group of bankers meeting in secrecy and then came into existence by holding a vote on Congress during a holiday.

Personally I like Mycelium wallet on phones. Set it up and record the seed words somewhere safe. The seed allows you to recover a wallet  if you loose your phone. DO NOT STORE THE SEED WORDS ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE. Set up a pin as well, the pin you enter whenever you transfer BTC out of the wallet. Thats it. Super simple and incredibly secure. If you have a lot of funds get a Trezor or Ledger they are a hardware device that adds a physical layer of security. Once I got more than $2k USD I thought the Trezor was a must, as a phone can be compromised (unlikely) but the Trezor will be very secure.

If people sell the entirety of the COIN ETF shares and there are 0 in existence then the price of bitcoin would go down but you couldn't sell more COIN ETF than people have already bought. I guess I don't see how it's possible that people think the ETF could drag the price of BTC down.

Why not make a holding company LLC that has no mention of bitcoin and put the bitcoin business as a subsidiary. Just for safety sake you could make a few other subsidiaries with mention of other industries. In the US its only a 1 or 2 hundred to create an LLC and doesn't take more than a few hours.

my understanding is that your private keys (paper wallet) will be able to sign transactions on either blockchain. before split there is a single blockchain after hard fork there are two blockchains where the nodes are running different code. you could use a BTU client and sell all the coins on that blockchain and still have all your BTC. your coins are safe either way because you control the private key.

all true. Approaching the problem from the perspective of a network engineer the lightning network is analogous to the multiple layers involved in IP networking. There are tons of overlapping and competing protocols in networking but if you really think about it each one has potential positive impact to the overall ecosystem and no downside. New protocols and systems brings additional layers of complexity. Besides increased technical debt and complexity I don't think a new protocol can detract from the ecosystem overall it always adds new features and possibilities for growth in new directions and new efficiencies.

I am genuinely curious how people are deciding that they know better than the core devs what needs to happen with the code. Are these emotional/political or economic/code arguments? If one is knowledgeable at a level to contribute then why not join development?
I am not disregarding any argument for block size increase but given that someone is competent and fully understands the implications of those code changes why not become a contributor to the code?
Also, we need to consider the possibility that there are outside forces in play trying to fragment Bitcoin. Think about it, this is an amazing distributed resilient system and the weak point is definitely the developers. Banks/Govs would be (are?) attacking the devs to fragment and postpone Bitcoin while they come up with their own crypto currency. 
My understanding is that the longest blockchain wins anyways so whatever the majority of miners choose would be the defacto Bitcoin. Personally I believe that the core developers and possibly miners should know best and unless evidence is provided that they have been compromised why attempt to split?

Hey network engineer here I do lots of DDoS mitigation so I know some details that might be interesting.
DDoS is basically just overwhelming the available internet bandwidth to a target. Its Distributed DoS [ denial of service ]. To generate the DDoS traffic the attacker either uses compromised hosts or takes advantage of a certain protocol on a large number of devices. Usually these are poorly configured and managed protocols that enable the attacker to amplify the traffic they send. For example, a NTP server can be used because you can send it a small packet and it will return a packet about 80 times larger containing the requested information. If you do this with a large number of things it will amplify your traffic and send it to the target. Also, these services usually have to be on an ISP that is not taking the proper precautions to prevent host address spoofing. The attacker forms packets that look like they come from the target, so these services send the amplified response to the target instead of back at the attacker.
Securing your devices and protocols would do much to mitigate if not eliminate these issues. Keep your servers updated and follow best practices. Leaving your servers vulnerable for hackers to use is like leaving guns loaded and sitting on your front lawn.

Bitcoin is Code and the system that is defined by that programming code.
Consider this analogy. I am an engineer that builds some of the world's largest datacenters and their associated networks. My small group of peers makes architecture decisions for these networks, literally nobody else in our company knows enough about how these things work to make an informed decision. If they did then they would be promoted into our group and their voice considered. We would never go to the lunch room and have everyone there vote on what network protocols to use and how to engineer the systems. Everyone has a specialty and unless you know EXACTLY how these things work your opinion is less important. It sounds inconsiderate at first but without precise knowledge of the system you don't know enough to make an informed decision. Do surgeons have the hospital staff vote on how to do brain surgery?

As we approach the end of the inflation subsidy the price of bitcoin would increase on the exchanges. There would be an economic incentive for the miners to continue processing transactions because at that point they will have many BTC saved up and will want to retain/increase the value of their holdings. Possibly there might be miners who would process transactions with no fee just to ensure that the BTC they hold goes up in value post mining subsidy.

QE (quantitative easing ie. money injected into the banks) flows towards those best deemed worthy. It cascades from the federal reserve to the banks and institutional investors then to companies. Currently the main recipients of this easy money is tech companies and startups. When you start thinking about how money works and who the recipients are it makes sense that this is basically welfare but targeted very specifically at those deemed to be most capable. They need to stimulate the economy but general handouts would cause inflated cost of living, so instead they are sacrificing the lower and middle classes to create an upper class utopia.

For people like you and me of course Bitcoin is superior but some grandma in the Phillipines is more likely to use the Facebook crypto because they can help her get into her wallet if she forgets the password.
Think about blockbuster vs bittorrent vs netflix. Bittorrent is superior but for the common person they wont go to the trouble of signing up for a good private tracker and curating torrents, they will use Netflix because its simple and better than going to a video rental store.
Fiat currency = video rental store
Facebook coin = Netflix

a futures market (unless you can settle for the commodity itself!) is just people betting each other in cash on what the price of bitcoin will do. You can Only settle these CME Bitcoin futures in cash and each trade is only locked in when a counterparty goes against your position. Example: Bob thinks Bitcoin will go down so he initiates a short futures contract, Evan thinks Bitcoin will go up so he is the long counterparty to Bob's short. The exchange only exists to track the price of Bitcoin and facilitate Bob and Evan betting each other.

Its only unstable because the value is still being discovered. A good analogy would be how valuable were the first gold coins? They might have been worth a cow one day or a loaf of bread a month later, for a new asset the market and liquidity isn't as efficient. Once cryptocurrency has been around for a hundred years I think the price would be more stable. The market will be much bigger and I bet at that point governments will be using their own cryptos.

Respectfully I disagree. Here is the reason why, I read an article recently about farmers in Myanmar using cellphones to browse Facebook. A large percentage of these people dont even have power in their homes and they use car batteries and converters to charge their cellphones. A huge portion of the planet is yearning for access to technology and I believe if we lay the necessary groundwork Bitcoin can be the bank account for these people. They travel to town to buy prepaid wireless cards so I dont think bitcoin would be a stretch. This would enable them to transact efficiently where at the moment they have no debit or credit card and no bank account.  They have no low fee way to receive money from family members who live in the cities or other parts of the world. Honestly I don't give a shit whether its raw Bitcoin or a combination of BTC and side channel payment like Lightning but we need to hustle and get 0-fee microtransactions going BEFORE the banks do. This would unlock the globe for bitcoin and needs to be a high priority.

Segwit lets us keep the blockchain exponentially smaller. This is important planning for the future and keeping Bitcoin decentralized.

He is a direct product of the system and he broadcasts this to the world instead of trying to hide it. He became the lightning rod for corporations profiting from pharmaceuticals. There is a huge problem in drug companies not reinvesting their profits into discovering new drugs, especially antibiotics. The media has attacked him because he is a single person instead of a hidden corporate boardroom.
I initiated my own research into this guy after hearing about him and I would say he is much less evil than many larger drug companies so really I would question that entire ecosystem instead of this single individual.

condensed version is that when it comes to open source software pretty much everything is coded up for POSIX which is a compatibility standard that OS X, UNIX, freebsd, and if course Linux (among others) all follow. the filesystems and tools that are expected to be there are all similar and in most cases compatible. windows said fuck everyone and they aren't compatible with the rest of the operating systems. they recently started to act differently and have WSL for windows 10 which is basically a Linux subsystem you can add to windows.

the trick Amazon uses is that they have near 0% profit. they continuously use any potential profit to improve the company and innovate. when the tax man comes at the end of the year they just say "sorry we didn't make any profit" BUT the kicker is that if you are management, engineer, or other higher ups in the company they pay you a good portion of your salary in stocks. so the stock appreciates a ton and then anyone who holds it can sell it for capital gains tax instead of salary tax.
if you make 115k in the US your salary is taxed at 33% but if you sell an investment held for a year or more it's only 15% or 20%. you basically are paying less than half the amount of tax you would if it was salary.
many CEOs take all their pay in stocks so they can say they made $0 salary and pay no capital gains tax lol

McDonald's operates 36,525 restaurants worldwide and is worth 97B. 2.6mil per location. I understand fully that stock price is about future potential and perception but do you really think Shake Shack is worth 6 times per location than McDonalds? The profit margin is higher per burger at Shake Shack of course, but is it high enough to offset the lower volume compared to a 24/7 McDonalds? There is a glut of stupid money in U.S. equities because of the insanely loose monetary policy and this is perfect example of the effect of it.
Shake Shack price/earnings ratio: 111
Papa Johns p/e ratio: 36
McDonalds p/e ratio: 23
get a fucking grip on reality, Shake Shack is valued at a p/e ratio like a tech company where they can have explosive growth unencumbered by stores and employees, its unreasonable for a fast food restaurant.

so you can look at it a few different ways. one way is that bitcoin is new and was relatively unknown so it's growing into it's true market value. another is that many people who love gold and keep a significant part of their wealth in it will never be interested in something purely digital.
it's kind of like how I can't use a gold coin or bar at the store, but gold has a market value of $1300/oz. nobody on the street will accept a gold coin from you for their cash even at a discount. same thing with cryptos.

I think a more apt analogy would be thinking about European explorers arriving somewhere like Papua New Guinea. Before everyone on the island kept record with large stones or rare sea shells. This works for their purposes so nobody thought to change. The Europeans arrive and try and trade silver coins for food, but most of the Islanders don't value the coins as much as their seashells they have never even seen silver because it isn't on their island. Eventually though as they are increasingly exposed to the outside world they begin to use coins to trade with the outsiders and then each other. 
BTC is the gold coin, fiat is a seashell. It might take a while to fully happen because many people don't recognize a revolutionary idea but eventually it will happen.

the price is relevant to me because it gives you a way to compare bitcoin with gold. currently the gold humans own is valued in the trillions, personally I think bitcoin does a better job than gold for most reasons people own gold except for how it looks. therefore I think it's only a matter of time before more people realize this and bitcoin is priced half as much as golf or more. probably $100k/BTC in the next 5 years.

think in a larger frame of reference for a minute. Some people are very well off, these people would never pay taxes if they could opt out. They have no need for any social assistance ever. In reality these people contribute 90% of the income tax in the US. By making tax totally voluntary you would evicerate the lower classes and there would be absolutely no social safety net to feed poor families and provide medical care for those most in need. Little government helper? In the US millionares and corporations pay the tax so the poor can have food and basic housing. In most of the world if you are poor you either starve or work as a slave for meager food to barely survive.

I realized a while ago that just like when you are a kid if you put something off you should get a bigger return later not a smaller return. If you let your friend have your food because he is starving naturally he should pay you back at least the same amount of food in the future, if he was a good friend he would give you a bit extra. Inflation is being paid back LESS on YOUR hard work (saved money) in the future. It is a scam and most don't realize they are being fleeced.

I totally agree with you BTW, personally I would be much much better off without paying into any social security or medicade.

people have been making the same arguments on both sides when BTC was $1, $10, $20, $100, $1000, $10000, $20000. if you don't believe in it sell it. personally I start buying when it dips, I started buying in 2014 after MtGox crash and I'm buying again now. of course it will fall and people loose interest until the next bubble don't be a bitch about it.

I watched closely what wallets people used for passing the lightning torch. The MIT group and the majority used Blue Wallet so that was good enough for me.
Its super easy with that! You just click to create a BTC wallet in the app then create the lightning wallet the same way. If you want to receive BTC via lightning create an invoice and send the code off to get paid. Its basically instant.

I am actually in China at the moment for business and I have some bitcoin related observations. A much larger percentage of the population here knows about bitcoin. Engineers for the tech companies here noticed my bitcoin sticker and wanted to talk about it, whereas many of my colleagues in the US dismiss it as for black market transaction it doesn't seem to have that connotation in China. Also, everything legit in China has the government involved, all large projects and businesses. So official government involvement in China is a stamp of approval of atleast some of the minister types. Of the younger people I talk to in clubs and resturants more had heard of bitcoin that in the US.

because it is very hard to take possession of your gold and very easy to posses your BTC.
say you are a wealthy individual and have a few hundred 1kg bricks of gold. each one weighs a lot, you would have to hire an armored truck to the vault that is holding it and hire security to travel with you. you need to build your own vault to store it at your house and probably hire security to watch it there. if you want to quickly move your money to a new country or location you basically can't.
compare this with BTC where you can store a Billion USD worth on a hardware wallet or even written down on pages of a book. you dont need a vault or high security and nobody will know you have it.

if a node didn't connect to any of these... an explorer wouldn't be able to reach it
Basically if for some reason you wanted to stay off the radar, you and your friends could set up specific lightning nodes that are only connected to each other. You would then have a neat off-chain way to pay each other. You could even set up extra nodes to improve your private network... just don't connect them to these known public ones and you will have a 'dark node'

Every single time people said "See! it's dead it's down so much it can never recover". Seriously is anything different this time? The only thing I can think of is the existence of a ton of alt-coins. During most of the previous bubbles there wasn't any other crypto currency.

it's because to find new blocks you have to do SHA256 hash on ( blockchain + random number ) looking for a hash result starting with a certain number of zeros. This hash result with a certain number of leading zeros is actually VERY hard to find now.. millions of computers mining around the world only find this on average every ten minutes. How would you find more blocks than this entire system and get ahead of it?

This argument is akin to burning the rainforest so it can be farmed immediately. It might be a good idea in the short term but at what long term cost? The devs who actually write the code know the long term cost.
