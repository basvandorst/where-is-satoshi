I don't know what OP thinks but as someone who agrees with him, I think an anarcho-syndicalist society is a lovely fantasy, however while you're at it you might as well go all out and have magical unicorns granting wishes too.

The line between rational and irrational self-interest is blurry, and many anarchists and libertarians happily caper way over that line, rejecting collectivism even where collectivism clearly leads to significant improvement in the circumstances of all participants. I am largely left with the impression that they have decided to reject collectivism, and then made up reasons why as they go.

Do you recognize the possibility of people not politely cooperating with being forcibly denied the necessities of life, for silly reasons like "you haven't got any money"?

True, although those misbehaviours are not necessarily criminal in nature, and historically include homosexuality, Judaism, adultery, etc.

How would you *make* something *necessary* other than by backing up your will with force?

I think you may have put your finger on a key distinction between conservative and liberal thought. Conservatives judge people by *who they are*, liberals by *what they have done*. 
Accordingly conservatives respect and protect authority figures and societal traditions and roles, despise underclasses, believe that power should be exercised to maintain status quo, etc; liberals are profoundly cynical about authorities' motivations, are egalitarian, indifferent to tradition and any etiquette beyond basic table manners, extend privileges to members of underclasses, etc.

That's interesting - the extent to which a person is conservative or liberal is part of who they are, however its visibility comes through what they have done.

The vast majority of humans have the "obey authority" mental defect, so authorities get obeyed regardless of their motivations and competence. This obedience is human nature, and it is *bad*.

Good point - I am wrong, there is a technology that can bring about anarcho-syndicalism. It's pervasive universally-accessible surveillance, the Grand Panopticon in which we are all guards and inmates, all able to audit all others' behaviours. Worth it?

Human nature is both bad and good, but only the bad stuff needs preventing.

I suppose if we made up water that wasn't wet, there'd be some advantages to that as well. There simply can't be such a thing as society without some mechanism to encourage pro-social and discourage anti-social behaviour - "force", if you like to frame it that way.

This is more in the category of water flowing uphill. It's not going to be possible to just "invent" a way to make humans never freeride, betray, or place short-term personal advantage over the collective good. Well, not if they're still to be "humans" as we understand the term.
