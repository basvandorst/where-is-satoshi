When government prints the money they don't just take it and spend it somewhere. It's put into circulation. 
And no, inflation isn't a form of tax, it's a form of making old debts worth less because they're old. You can't print your way out of your debt without suffering major economy collapse to go with it. None of the major currencies are being used the way you campaign against.

Except when it's a functioning country there is nothing to rob because the government are the same people...

Show me one untraceable way to print money and just take it.
Delusions of people these days...

Ah, yes, history of civilization. This argument works especially well when we are in a reddit thread discussing one of the oldest currencies in the world, which did not do what you are campaigning against. The irony.

Explain how bitcoin can prevent countries experiencing disasters that have nothing to do with currency in the first place.

Inflating currency for no reason would mean the money you steal is worth less too. The reasons governments would do that to steal money rival flat earth theories.

It's not free money then. Government spending is well documented and very visible and what you are trying to imply happens doesn't happen. Steady inflation is a healthy thing as it decreases the value of all money so that hoarding money in a sock is not viable. 
WW1 and WW2 were the largest and most brutal wars we ever had it's not something you base your economy on and inflation was far from the worst thing that happened.
Talking to you I just feel like you're just the most typical american with the delusion that the government is some untouchable mafia and all they do is rob the average joe. Aka politics of hollywood.

You're actually insane if you think that. Turkish lira fell because of bad financial decisions and politics. None of that would change with any other currency, if you borrow too much and your country gets a dictator your economy will suffer.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:35:49


most nations have debt to their own people which is not a problem, but a feature that helps economies grow in the first place. 
The problems come when you borrow too much from other countries like Greece did. Again, not the fault of the currency, just stupidity and lies. 


It can, but only if you assume everyone is brain dead and would print it to the point it's harmful. 
Not to mention that does not apply in this case to Turkish lira. That is not what hurt it's purchasing power.

US is not a dictatorship, it's just a mess. And Singapore is a special snowflake, rare case of a benevolent dictatorship.

It's not. Average person was never able to buy as much as they can today any other time in history. Inflation helps stop people from hoarding money in a sock, which means it boosts investment, which means more people get more money overall.

Holding money in the sock sure seems like an exiting way to live life. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:50:35
Wasn't it always? People believing it has value is the main concept. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:43:46
Not a dictatorship? It's actually too free and too overrun by people manipulating other people for their own interests without regards towards others. 
The amount of lobbying in the US would never fly in Europe, but hey, Europe is a shit continent, ayy.

Overall less people are in poverty and even the definition of poverty has changed, poverty used to mean dying from starvation or slaving in a factory until collapsing back in the day, these days it means not having enough money to buy any luxuries. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:42:52
Because the graph is retarded. Yes, the value of a single dollar has decreased, but the amount of dollars people have increased with it. Overall the purchasing power of a single individual has never been higher, it doesn't matter what shape of currency is being used.

People like this guy can call taxes theft and then blame the city for not fixing a pothole on his daily route in the same sentence. Just so dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:53:53
Which is stupid. It can't be a currency if it's worth different amounts every hour.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:24:21
Yeah, especially one based on nothing. Real currencies have far more weight than crypto even if they aren't backed by gold anymore. It's near impossible to determine real value of bitcoin at the moment and that is terrible for a currency. 
From all angles cryptocurrency just looks like a pyramid scheme at this point, those who get in early get more than those who get in last when it all comes crashing down.

How exactly? It's a house people live in, are you saying houses don't exist?

Do you get paid in bitcoin? Because if you don't you already paid the taxes.
