You CAN store it on Google Drive.

Saying "Fighting" you mean trying to steal Bitcoin name?
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:59:10
You should do your own research. Don't trust, verify.

Those feeling, when you are ukrainian, but never heard about this movie and read about it on reddit.

Waiting for singlesig.

I like the way they put the lightning icon on the B-letter.
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:52:17
I have the same feeling.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:39:48
Core isn't just a good wallet, it is your contribution in network safety.
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:59:22
That feeling when you are from Ukraine��
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:22:56
WOW,  singlesig please!
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:10:48
No it is not (UA).
@_date: 2019-03-26 11:30:33
Or just use it)
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:48:14
This guy got it
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:26:32
My seed is on the paper only - is this a paper wallet?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:41:23
Ok, I get it. It is cold wallet, yeah?
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:37:49
Do not compare Litecoin or other crypto to BTC

It is my choice also.

All above?

@_date: 2019-06-25 12:21:22
90% of all market cap is fake. 
Almost all fake volume is about altcoins. 
So the true Bitcoin dominance is 90-95%.
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:31:09
No. Not that one.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:41:00
There is a mistake on it.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:41:20
2-of-2 multisig already have Green wallet. I have more trust on it.

@_date: 2019-04-15 11:33:17
Oh, then... What wallet will you recomend to create bip39 hd wallet? Now I use samourai wallet 12 word seed.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:42:43
I mean there no need in other wallet, when you run bitcoin full node.
@_date: 2019-04-16 06:00:55
Can I download the single-sig version from Google Play?
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:59:25
Next BCH.
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:14:08

@_date: 2019-04-16 05:59:48
BCH is true BitConnect.
@_date: 2019-04-08 09:22:12
Ok, I see. Why then I should run Electrum server when I have Bitcoin Core full node? Just to support Electrum network?
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:39:22
So what if I have 100 inputs? I have HD wallet and every time using a new address.
@_date: 2019-04-08 05:46:17
This. I am in progress to run my own node now. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:44:38
Thanks for the answer. I like Electrum also. Green awesome wallet, but I am not convenient with multisig. Just will wait for singlesig option.
I can't understand why are you recommend samourai only for small amounts? A thought wallets use the same mechanism to make entropy in wallet's seeds.
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:10:11
Got it. I think I will sleep better with my 12 seed words.
@_date: 2019-04-04 03:52:45
That is really sad. For median transaction for 400$ it is not much to pay 1-2$ fee. But smaller transactions are painful to send. Waiting for lightning to spread widely.

$5 wrench crack multisig as well.

Why should I run Electrum node instead of Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2019-04-15 09:46:40
Yes, it is less secure. But I am OK with that fact that it will take only 1 million years to crack my password instead of a 1 billion that crack a 12 word seed.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:56:40
What do you mean expiry date in receiving address?

Yes I know. It i a good resource.
I just want to ensure that it is secure with really strong password.

Watch it for five times and can't help laughing.
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:40:10
For example I will put my seed in passworded .rar that I will be able to crack in a year. And sent an email to myself with password via some online services. Where do I am wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:28:46
This. Upwote question.

Memes are behind doge, but what is behind bcash?
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:43:18


BTC is inflationary.
About  3.73% per year now. 
It will be  1.80% inflation after halfing next year.
It is deflationary compare to fiat with it's 3-5% usual inflation rate .
@_date: 2019-09-20 07:53:54
\&gt; hand wrote the  private keys
You can make a mistake easily.
You can do the same with  [  or with it's offline github version.
It is more easy to handwright 12 word seed with password than a private keys.
