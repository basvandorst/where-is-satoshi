I'm not an expert but I do remember the 10 minute block being chosen for very good security reasons. Perhaps someone else can add to this.

Counterparty and RSK have their own approaches to smart contracting being developed on the more secure Bitcoin blockchain. That makes them both superior to my eyes already. Don't have the threat of systemic errors and hardforks to correct dumb coding mistakes.

So not segwit? Gotchu.

"If decentralization mattered, why are we not even talking about miner centralization? Literally a handful of miners/pools have control over bitcoin."
Ongoing centralization concerns elsewhere doesn't mean we suddenly throw in the towel on keeping any other part of the system decentralized. That's literally insane. It's the only thing that gives Bitcoin any value at the end of the day otherwise it's a really bad paypal. 
Increasing the block size increases miner and node centralization. If scale can be achieved without doing so, good. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:06:59
How do you define "barely tested"?
@_date: 2016-06-26 06:16:16
This is just false. As an extreme example, if the block size were 8GB most people wouldn't have the resources to "freely start a node". Bitcoin decentralization comes from the fact there are so many nodes (although shrinking all the time) and competing miners. Forces, like increased block sizes, which reduce the number of nodes and encourage miner consolidation reduce the robustness of the system and make it more vulnerable to manipulation and attack. The higher the node count and number of miners the more secure the system is at present. Aka the more decentralized it is.

Unfortunately there are those on both sides who turn it into a very antagonist environment. Not much that can be done except refusing to buy into that narrative, and find people you can have an actual constructive conversation with. 
After a bit of thought I think you're correct in that the system of an upper block limit is less than ideal for the reason that artificial restraints are less than ideal in any economic setting. However your post doesn't address the entire picture, namely nodes. These are already on the downward trend and it makes sense that any increases in block size will only accelerate that trend. The problem of course is there is little to no financial incentive to run a node. Miners can continuously plow profits into improving resources to handle bigger blocks, but node operators don't have this luxury. So it seems to me that without hard block limits and all else being equal, the miner's block capacity would quickly outpace what the node network can handle. 
My conclusion so far is that removing hard block limits, while optimal, can't be done without first figuring out a way to incentivize nodes. That is the bottleneck, and most vulnerable part of the system at current. I think it's reasonable to believe that at some point there will be very powerful and well coordinated attacks on the Bitcoin network, whether by nation states or other parties simply seeking to short the market. They will go after the weakest point which right now is clearly the nodes. Making sure they don't drop off even more rapidly in the short term, and addressing their lack of financial incentive in the long term, seem to be the priorities to me for a robust system. Anxious to hear your feedback.

Why isn't it P2P? It's just a chain of peers instead of direct. Also with anyone who owns bitcoin able to set up a node, and the software routing the cheapest "path" for payment, why would it be more centralized? 
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:45:02
While this might be inevitable at current pace, why should it be encouraged or accelerated? Regardless of normal network operation, having that few nodes makes the network *very* susceptible to attack. 
The lack of incentive to run a full node may be Bitcoin's Achilles heel, but I'm confident that a solution can be found over time. Until then I feel like we have to buy as much time as possible by making it as easy as possible to altruistically run a node.
This comes with a caveat however. We shouldn't increase pressure on nodes unless it's absolutely necessary to scale. The thing is this is not currently the case. Segwit can squeeze more transactions into the same space, as well as improves propagation and other upgrades. Lightning network essentially does the same by a much greater order. 
Segwit is close, much closer than settling on and implementing a hardfork at this point. That'll take some significant pressure off until LN rolls around. But even if we have to put up with fuller blocks until then I'm not convinced that will slow adoption. Everyone I personally talk to is hesitant about using bitcoin because of perceived security issues, and of course volatility. Not because their 10 minute confirmation is taking 30. 
After we solve the larger problem of incentivizing nodes, then we can remove hard block limits and not have to worry about miners vastly outstripping them. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 06:18:22
What if you could improve the user experience over time without increasing centralization pressure at all? And what if that takes a bit longer to get rolling? Is that not better for the system long term? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:20:20
Not a safe haven for citizens whatsoever (with those few exceptions), but with it's response to financial crises and ongoing development it can soon be a legitimate safe haven for more risk friendly institutions. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 06:25:41
That only kicks the miner can down the road, it doesn't inherently fix anything. It also compromises network security when we don't have to to scale (just like we don't have to sacrifice decentralization). 
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:52:11
After taking a look at this and the node40 website, I still have zero clue what their business model is or how this is sustainable. Any one can independently reward a node with some btc if they reach that agreement but it's still altruism. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:57:21
I guess that the support for amateur programmers doesn't translate to security in those programs. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:18:18
Even if true, and there's no real way of knowing until it deploys and develops, it doesn't threaten the decentralization of the underlying protocol. So the worse case scenario is still better than jacking up the block size because something something satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:10:51
So you're arguing earning a profit for taking a risky investment is sinful or at least highly immoral? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 06:27:42
Great post by Maxwell. It's non-nonsensical to give up any degree of network security and decentralization for scalability, when we can scale without that trade off with just a little bit more patience. Bitcoin is a multi decade project. We shouldn't be sacrificing the long term health of the system for short term gains. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:22:09
Lol I thought the same. StorJ with amazing compression algorithms. "encrypted distributed shards" I lol'ed
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:16:30
And is still being heavily tested? How does that qualify for "without even thinking about the ramifications even a little bit?". 
Best case scenario a block size increase hurts long term system health in favor of a short term boost, assuming it even leads to more adoption which is doubtful. Worst case scenario it's just stupid. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:12:08
You encourage miners with higher tx fees hehe
On a serious note: With Lightning coming along to move transactions off chain an increased blocksize means even less fees for miners. Switching hashes will be a non-starter with the miners. And there's no actual evidence that jacking up the block size will magically increase general user adoption while volatility is so high. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:48:04
I like your points and I'm exploring this line of reasoning myself. I think this still doesn't address nodes though which are already on a decline. There is very little financial incentive to run nodes, while miners can make a boat load of money by continuing to up their capacity and bandwidth to handle bigger blocks just fine. If this is the case then without a hard limit it seems possible to me that miners would leave nodes behind. All else being equal, they would become more costly to run in terms of resources for the same reward of zilch. Nodes seem like the systems current limitation and bottleneck to me when it comes to block size. 
So miners may be ready to process much larger blocks, and in a functioning system should be able to do so, but that doesn't mean it won't adversely impact the node network. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:18:08
The difference is security. 100 nodes can easily be subject to a coordinated attack. 10,000 nodes not so much. We're currently trending to the former, and increasing network load will only accelerate that tend as less people are able to run the node. LN will increase throughput massively without putting more pressure on nodes. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:43:09
It would put market based limits on block size, but thanks to their income they can continue to increase that block size. Nodes don't have the same luxury, and will continue to drop off as network resources increase. Because there are scaling solutions on the table and being developed right now that can increase throughput without putting further pressure on nodes, we should take those approaches. 
I agree that limits set by miners and market forces are ideal, but until we can also incentivize nodes so that they can keep up instead of constantly declining, this can't be done. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 06:50:30
This is actually an excellent reply that gives me something to think about. Cheers m8

"Reasonable people would like to see adaptive block sizes in addition to segwit and other on chain scaling options that should have happened forever ago, but instead we are stuck because "I won't stop hitting you until you stop hitting me" kinds of toddler arguments. "
As far as I'm aware there is no sound dynamic block proposal yet, so maybe that's why?

"legislation that helps fence the scammers out will be an aid to bitcoin"
And how exactly does this kind of legislation accomplish that? Are there online crypto scammers who *have* to declare their business in North Carolina? 
These kind of rules, even though they're pretty tame relative to other fintech regs, are still stupid when it comes to Bitcoin. Anyone using Bitcoin for malicious purposes can easily and simply avoid the regulated choke points and go on with their business. Meanwhile the would be legitimate entrepreneurs in these jurisdictions get screwed. These regulators have no clue what they're doing or talking about, and bobble heads like Boring don't help.
