My advice would be to try and make a market (post a bid you are willing to buy for and an ask you are willing to sell for) on BitFloor, you will make the spread on market orders on either direction. Arbitrage is really tough cuz of how long it takes to move dollars around. As far as "day trading" it would be tough unless there are big moves, since it's mostly trended up, it is hard to buy on dips...especially if you are doing it manually. 
As far as fees, it is relatively simple to program up something that automatically calculates the price inclusive of fees...

BitFloor is by far my favorite way to get cash into an exchange. That other post is right, no ID required, just drop off money, it is available within 30 minutes (in my experience, and that is what I was told).
The fees are relatively low...I believe my deposit amount was $302.97 for $300 which is under 1%, and you CAN actually buy bitcoins with no fee, if you understand how a maker/taker model works. Basically, if you are adding liquidity (leaving an order on their book) you receive a .1% rebate.
Full disclosure, the liquidity is not the best, but it is growing. You may not see the same prices as you would on Mt. Gox, but you won't have to deal with vouchers, and all the hoops you have to jump through.
To WITHDRAW, however, I believe you need to set up ACH Direct Deposit which does require bank routing info as well as name and stuff. So that process is not quite as simple, but once you have your bitcoins you can of course transfer them wherever you want and withdraw your cash that way...
tl;dr Bitfloor is so far the cheapest, fastest way to get bitcoins for USD.
