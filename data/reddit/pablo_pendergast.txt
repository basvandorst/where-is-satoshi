Trying to cover it! One idea at a time!!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:08:35
But everyone on here said bitcoin was going and I quote "to the moon". And that hodling was the right thing to do. I just wanted to hodl and be the new warren buffet of bitcoins, with maximum exposure and getting rich quick.

I'm going to try and cover with my 401k. Won't need it for a few years. Might cover this margin call though I'll be 500k in the hole. After that it's �� to the �� just like you said. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:52:12
Please. I just need advice. What should I do?? I just want to keep hodling like you all said. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:06:26
Now you're catching on. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:39:47
What about this?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:45:16
To conclusions mat. Yes I have one. Next. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:56:28
Coinbase is down. I can't.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:40:06
So bitcoin then.

Taking it all out would mean I'm not hodling anymore wtf. I think I figured it out. I'm going to leverage out my 401k and  get my ticket on that rocket ship!!!

I do have a "jump to conclusions" mat in my kitchen. I made it myself. It's this mat that you place on the floor, and you have different "conclusions" written on it that you can "jump" to.

But you all keep talking about gong to the moon!!! I read on here that it was going to $100,000. What is happening???
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:39:25
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:28:21
Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:13:25
Anything you lol'd at in particular?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:06:26
Ok, just send me your bitcoin wallet. I'll just take enough to cover costs then send it back. PM for details. Tks. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:33:27
It's exactly like BTC so not sure why I'm being attacked. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:04:03
You all said it was going to the moon! That it was guaranteed to go to 10,000 this year.
