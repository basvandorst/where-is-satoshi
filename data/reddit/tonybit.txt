Why would anyone be interested in a store of value that is as volatile as BTC?

Does anyone know if Coinbase sells coins they own or just coins via GDAX? Or both?

I lived through the dot com bubble and was employed in tech at the time. I think you make a good point. I think Bitcoin may end up like AOL. That’s not a bad thing. AOL was the first means of getting online for millions of users. It outlived it’s usefulness but it left an indelible mark on ISPs, the www, email, and chat. If BTC ends up AOL that could be a win.

I think Blockchain has legs. I think BTC is overvalued. It is clunky and useless as a currency. However, it is the first to market and acts as a gateway to Altcoins for many people.

I completely agree. Well said. I would like to add that propping something up is very different than letting it stand up on its own two feet.

No speculators trying to get rich quick here. Move along. Lol.

Any decent 15-30 year mortgage will not have a pre-payment penalty. Anyone who would signup for one that does is really foolish. Just paying $100 extra a month to principal can save thousands and reduce the term by years. Just saying...

Yea except you would still have real property that you could flip, rent, or live in. Big difference.

BTC value doesn’t exist without FIAT and therein lies the rub.

Very very expensive old VCRs

Not a bad analogy

Decreasing spending on things people don’t need sounds good. In fact, I do that myself. However, if the masses do that, your economy goes in the shitter. No spending equals less demand. Less demand equals less jobs. Less jobs equals increased poverty, crime, etc. Ease of spending makes for a strong economy. Maybe BTC does become a store of value long term and is never a currency. We will have to see how things shake out once the investors looking to make a quick buck get out and the tech matures.

That’s a good point looking at legacy data. However, the increased interest in Bitcoin may get entities involved (government, Wall Street types) that change its trajectory. A lot of unknowns long term. Looking backwards you are 100% right.

A real business that just lost Microsoft as a customer bc of price volatility and high transaction fees. I’d say this infant needs to put down its pacifier before we say it’s maturing.

This may be valid. However, please stop calling Bitcoin and many other cryptos a store of value. A true hedge against FIAT and currency manipulation wouldn’t drop 30% because Chinese people sell holdings to go on vacay. Give me a break.

It’s highly overvalued right now. Although, I agree the use case for block chain is strong.

Great handle. Dot com had huge gains. So did real estate in 2000s. Bubbles happen

Thank you for that info. Invaluable.

Used to be true. Monero is preferred privacy coin now. That said, I get your point.

Awesome. Thanks!!
