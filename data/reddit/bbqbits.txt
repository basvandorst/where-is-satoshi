"Launched in UK" is a very very big stretch for what they have actually done.
*  At the moment, they are allowing UK people to sign up.
*  No margin trading available
*  No BTC/GBP cross available (or planned)
*  No GTB/USD cross available (yet)
*  No GBP deposits
*  No UK banking intergration, so 5 day flaky international wire transfers only!
All in all, you go through KYC and everything to only be able to deposit eth or btc and only be able to trade that pair!!!
FFS guys we can get that service in 2 minutes flat from a dozen crypto exchanges without all the KYC, and even get margin at Bitfinex! Why the hell would we use Gemini (As a UK citizen)?

Well depends which country the customer is in. In the UK it falls under the 'The Sale of Goods and Services' act in that they have varied the service without informing the customer. At least i'm guessing that is what he is alluding to.

I wrote the company description describing exactly what we do. No chance of it being interpreted as a money transmitter.

I very much doubt that from the description I gave them of the business. The only connection with bitcoin is that we use the blockchain. What really yanks my chain is I was once involved with a business that had a similar stunt pulled on it by Paypal and I swore I would never do business with Paypal again. I told myself Braintree were different, so gave them a shot, but they seem to have become their parent.
