Encrypt your wallet.  Don't keep all your coins in one wallet. Don't use a Microsoft operating system.  Problem solved.

Yes, the difficulty goes up.  But the price of Bitcoin goes up with it.  Bitcoin was $12 when I ordered my first miner in 2012.

It takes less than a minute to go to website with a Bitcoin mining calculator and see that BFL ASIC's pay for themselves in a few months.  Educate yourself before you troll in public.  My miners have paid for themselves several times over.  A 300% return on investment.

You are excessively rich compared to a large percentage of the world's population.  Do you want people in poor countries searching for you?

OP is mistaken.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.

Baby steps.  We'll get there.
Of course a pure cryptocurrency transaction is the goal, but during the transition, a bitcoin to fiat conversion is needed to make sales easier for vendors.

I'm sorry, but I have to agree with the people that say we should stop using fake images of physical coins.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.  Using images of physical coins will only add to the confusion about Bitcoin in the minds of the general public.

50,000 miners sold and delivered and just because yours got lost during shipping then BFL is a scam?
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:42:26
I was one of the people that pre-ordered in 2012. So those miners made money easy. But even since that time, I have ordered another miner from BFL in December and they shipped it in days. With the price of Bitcoin climbing back up to $1,000, that miner is on it's way to making a profit as well.
Now let me ask you a question. Do you actually own a miner or are you just falling victim to the anti-BFL herd mentality that exists here on Reddit?
As for the exact amount of money I have invested in Bitcoins and miners, I opt not to answer that.  There are too many kooks here on Reddit for me to feel safe disclosing that information.

Actually, I tripled my money in less than six months . Tell me where I can get a CD that pays a return on investment like that.

The lesson I am taking away from this horrible mistake is don't keep all your Bitcoins in one wallet - spread them out.

Bfgminer is compatible with BFL miners.  Google it.

You do not have to mine Bitcoins with your Jalapeño.  There are other cryptocurrenies that use the SHA-256 algorithm.  My Jalapeno is still making $100 a month mining Zetacoins.

At least your friends listened to you.  I started promoting Bitcoin to my friends in 2012 and not one bought in early like I encouraged them to do.  Although one of them did buy a miner from Butterfly Labs - which he sold on eBay as soon as he recieved it because he saw that they were selling for 4 times what he paid for it.

It's already too late.  Half of all the existing Bitcoins are owned by 927 people.  I don't remember the source for that, but you can Google it.

No one stole your Bitcoin, you just have to put on your big boy pants and be patient.  All the exchanges are under a heavy load at this time.

Sorry about your luck, but just because you had a bad experience with them doesn't mean that the rest of us 50,000 customers did.  My miner has paid for itself several time over.  Now I'm happily looking forward to the next generation of miners.

BFL did not ruin anything for me.  I knew that I was pre-ordering a product that did not yet exist and that I would have to wait for it. 
Since I received it in October, it has paid for itself several times over.
Where else can you earn a 300% return on your money in only two months?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:44:35
You have my pity.  Your angst is obviously based on your frustration over the fact that you did not get in early like many others did.  But the most pitiable thing is that you can't see the massive, worldwide infrastructure that is being built on top of the Bitcoin protocol.  Bitcoin is going to change everything, just as the WWW did in the 1990's.

They are just mad that they did not think of Bitcoin themselves.
