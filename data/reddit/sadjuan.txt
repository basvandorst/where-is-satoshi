ha ha! I know right? I'm sat in my house in the UK watching my kids play on the Xbox and I can easily send someone in NYC some money across the pond within minutes. And why do people still think Bitcoin is not worth investing in? I have no idea. It just makes sense.

James has his tickets. He is going to get cleaned up and will start traveling soon. He is going to need some Bitcoin for food over his 14 hour journey. I can't wait to see how this turns out! He is going to succeed because Of Bitcoin and the kindness of strangers scattered across the earth. Please help some more you can guys. 
I don't even see him as some needy homeless guy anymore. He is a friend who is in a jam and he just needs a little help.

Ok so latest update. James didn't get on the bus.  got him a paid research study on Craigslist where he will be paid $2000 after two months for participating. It was a sudden change but this will be better for James right now. So we just wait and see how it all plays out. But yeah I would say James caught his break. Thanks to everyone who helped out.

If anybody is on Twitter, words of encouragement and positive vibes would be worth a lot. We need to show him that people are routing for him and want to see him succeed. Imagine getting messages from loads of people on the internet believing in you when everyday people in the street ignore you. If nobody can donate then this kind of positive outreach can be just as valuable. Thanks guys
