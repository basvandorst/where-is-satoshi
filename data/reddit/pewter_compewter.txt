Which would destroy bitcoin overnight. The code isn't ready and no I'm not suggesting we increase the block size to allow for this bagholder fantasy to become real. Secondary layers need to be built first to leverage Bitcoin's power. The average Greek citizen isn't ready, and probably never will be, to keep up with and understand private keys and basic security. It would be a disaster for Bitcoin and the people who would be unfairly thrown into some confusing crypto-anarchist dystopia. 
In short, Bitcoin is not for the masses and never will be, nor should it be. Diamonds are also not for the masses.

Agreed, but I think 450 is the new floor. Miners would rather just hold and keep mining as they can't recoup costs at sub 450 levels, if not higher. 
Big money is lining up behind bitcoin, just look at the mining industry, those guys will hold until the rest of the institutional investors show up and pump a few hundred billion into it. 
Right now, for miners, one bitcoin = one bitcoin. A miner that invested 50K into mining equipment would rather hold till 10,000 even if it's 10 years from now.

You are asking the wrong questions, it's not up to the consumer. lol
No one asked you in 1989 if you wanted to register for school, make a doctors appointment or do banking online on a website.....but now that's what you have to do. No one asked you, it was never up to you.
So when business owners see their competitors cut prices by 20% and become more profitable because they cut their transaction fees they won't ask their customers, they will switch in order to remain competitive. 
In 1989 you would have said " I don't understand why a consumer would want to do business over a website when they can do it face to face"
But it was never up to them.

bitcoin is not down, let's clear that up right now. :)
Check the box at the top for 2 Years.....now, what was this crazy talk about being down? 
9000% ++ increase is not down, actually that is the exact opposite of down. lol
What is happening now, well, what happened 6 months ago? A bunch of "get rich quick" dummies that knew nothing about the underlying tech behind bitcoin heard that you could buy a bitcoin and it would go up up and up to the mooooooooon. 
Now, those same dummies are dumping (well, over the past 4 weeks they've been dumping) to salvage around 50% of their "investment" so they don't have to tell their wives they took a 3rd mortgage out to buy online electronic tulips. 
I say "tulips" only because in my mind, anyone who would blindly throw money at bitcoin AT AN ALL TIME HIGH LAST NOVEMBER could only have been buying tulips, anyone that understood anything about bitcoin, markets, finance or economics would have waited for the subsequent drop, the one we are living in now.
Speaking of, now is a great time to buy as we have clearly reached the floor. $450ish is the new floor but that won't last long. This is a comfortable floor because prior to the Nov. price bubble bitcoin was around $250. 
 Just like November 2013 was _not_ the time to buy, now is _not_ the time to sell. 
And anything someone says "to the moon" run like hell.

Same as every other billion dollar industry. BTC has a market cap of 7 billion, well, 6.5 now but still. 
Look at media companies, why do you think some of us have been saying for years there is agenda, bias and propaganda in media, because 6 companies own all American media, all of it, 6. 
So it's no different than life, just easier to see in a microcosm.

98% of all bitcoins are owned by 2% of bitcoin owners.

Thanks, again, I'm glad you see it my way. As I said above, the only true starting point is the day Satoshi mined the genesis block, it was worth $0.00 as far as I am aware. Each buyer's starting point is the point at which they bought in, as with all stocks and investments.

If I remember correctly, Gox had a reputation for being shady all the way back to 2011. 
They stopped cash withdrawals in October, or was it before? I bet it was when a price jump happened. $2, $5 $15 bitcoin was fine, they loved that, more flat screens. October is when BTC went from $50 - $1250. They never saw that coming. So they were not liquid at $1200 each. At $50 each fractional reserve isn't so hard. But at $1250 if even 10% of your customers want to w/d their money it can't be done. 
So clearly they were just screwing around all those years and didn't care because they never imagined $1250 each. What turned a lot of computer geeks into millionaires with the best Thanksgiving ever was the worst thing that could have happened to the Samurais at Gox.

The media, owned by 6 corporations (and I thought bitcoin was supposedly a rigged game) will never tell the unbiased truth. And the worst part, people do not want the unbiased truth. They want sensationalism, they want scandal, they want blood and gore on their news and hearing that the CEO of Bitcoin.com, Inc. stole all the bitcoins and sold them to the King of Silk Road spreads like wildfire.

Welcome to the life of a non-liberal. Those of use who do not believe in the repeated failures of progressivism (how are those Great Society housing projects working out?) have been saying this about the media for YEARS. 
I am just glad someone else is listening finally. 
You want bias, look at the unemployment numbers, the size of the labor force, the number of people on welfare....compare those figures from today to 2004. Then check the media's reporting on Bush's handling of the economy with 5% unemployment and 6% GDP growth with the highest labor force participation rates in 30 years, but all the media could do was talk about how bad things where, so that's what people believed. Now, labor force participation rates are at their LOWEST levels in 30 years, Welfare recipients are at all time highs, GDP is like 1 or 2% which barely keeps up with population growth and the REAL unemployment rate is something closer to 20%, but because the labor force has shrunk so much the "official" unemployment rate looks AWESOME. Thats just how numerators and denominators work, make one smaller and the other one gets smaller. Less people working, although more people are actually out of work, but when you do the "official" math the unemployment rate drops. Neat. 
Yet, where is the daily story from the media about all Obama's lies? Non-existant. 
Imagine, honestly imagine, be honest with yourself, if these numbers belonged to a white guy, or Bush, or a Republican, how would the media report on them?

You have to register to vote right? When you register you get one votecoin. You spend the votecoin to the address (wallet) of the candidate of your liking. At the end the candidate with the most coins wins. 
No need for voter ID and no more voter fraud. We know how many people registered and how many votecoins were given out so simple math can prove if it was fair or not.
No more candidates getting 150% of the vote in certain counties. I can't believe people allow the fraud we call "elections" to have such real consequences over their lives.

We should be at $1000 per BTC and the little cryptos like Doge should be at 300-500 Satoshi.

To the comments written thus far, what the OP is asking is probably not safe, however, blockchain uses Javascript, so NOTHING during key generation happens on their servers, it ALL happens in your browser.
If you are not on a bot filled windows bug-fest you should be fine to use blockchain.info web wallets for basic quick easy bitcoin wallets and no I would not store $100K of life savings there, if I had that kind of savings I'd hire someone to teach me how to properly create a cold wallet.
Again, javascript does not run on blockchain's servers, so they can not "send you other keys" or somehow store some information about your wallet or change it all willy nilly later. 
Your private key is generated from a combination of your password, entered into the browser, and the seed. You have to have the password and seed to log in. The seed is also randomly generated on each page load, via good ol' javascript that runs only in your browser. 
Andreas would not do anything to jeopardize bitcoin's potential and would not have blockchain doing shady things, by the design they are not even capable of being shady with the web wallet.

Let's do this on every crypto forum every day until the idiots learn. Or just let them lose everything, whatever. I really don't care or have an ounce of sympathy.
If I had a million bucks, or even a thousand bucks in BTC, I would have NEVER left them sitting on a damn exchange. 
Exchange != bank
We can spam that too if you want. 
Wallet = bank
That too
Having never purchased a bitcoin until recently but being familiar with it since 2009, I always knew not to use Gox. I don't understand how anyone else thought it was a _good_ idea. It seemed like common knowledge not to use them. And letting fortunes just SIT there??? I mean, yea, common knowledge, I thought...

Dogecoin = bitcoin to 99% of the world's population, it might as well have been Bitcoin's logo on that car. The fact that it was ANOTHER digital currency adds that much more legitimacy to bitcoin.

Do you know how many billions of dollars they lost just last year? Google it. You'd be surprised. If they were _not_ taxpayer funded they would have gone under a long time ago. Email is not the only reason, but it's a big one. As is competition i.e. UPS/FedEx. Think of bitcoin as competition to banks. They get massive taxpayer subsidies too (TARP?) so they will be able to remain on life support, like USPS, at the expense of the average working person. Bitcoin may not dethrone them, but it already has earned it's spot as an alternative.

for someone that talks about uninformed opinions, you sure do have a lot of them. 
Look how well regulation works to protect people, but don't stop reading until you get to the part about the actual punishments imposed by said regulators, you will really love that part, I link it first, here it is:
You have a lot of homework to do but afterwards you will be informed of what "regulation" is in the real world and how it works (or doesn't) to protect people from fucking each other out of money and scam at every available opportunity. 
EDIT: I want to point out that I am not making a point out of how small the punishment was , my point is that it happened anyway involving some of the most highly regulated industries on the planet. On the subject of the punishments, Barclay's essentially stole $350 TRILLION dollars and had to pay back $200 million. That's like a billionaire paying a fine of one Dogecoin, seriously, basically nothing happened. So, what deterrent is there from it happening again? The awesome regulations you love so much?

Please re-read, I said Bitcoin in the strict sense. I also noted that were some clone to be used, I used Litecoin as an example, then I would invest in shares of that company (coins of that currency).
Please re-read the quote at the bottom of my post where it is noted that without the asset of the coins the network would rely on trust in a 3rd party, which is unacceptable. 
Therefore, any technology based on the bitcoin protocol will necessarily include some asset, that is what I will invest in but right now it's Bitcoin in the strict sense.

Please see above where I said: 


Does that really sound like gambling? That and " never buy in on a high". 
You should not buy in at the peak of a bubble, sorry but that is true. 
Then I said, "Wait for the dip", and apparently that remark really flustered your fanny so try to look at it like this "don't buy in on an all time high", that is what it means. Can you understand that?
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:15:53
If you aren't trading and your investment was a very long term one then you will do fine. 
I will say, not to sound critical, but there's no reason not to learn from this experience, never buy in on a high, always, always always always wait for the dip. I learned that one the hard way so I thought I might share it with you.

I don't mean to sound critical, and don't take what I am saying wrong, but I want others to understand that "having" 2FA security is only true if you have it on everything. Just like if you leave one door unlocked you may as well have left them all unlocked.

If you put your USD in a high yield mutual fund, it will also be predicted to climb too. But you still have to buy things. 
So for now, use fiat for daily purchases. No one is saying not to. What we are suggesting is that bitcoin or even cheaper alt coins like DOGE should be introduced to society slowly and adopted gradually. 
Since you have to start somewhere, why not buy .01 bitcoins to donate to that website? Or whatever, tip someone here some DOGE.

are....are you actually defending the scam known as E-Gold?? Yes, I was involved in E-Gold and held a substantial amount in 2005/6. When I found out it was only being used by drug dealers I cashed out, the FBI closed them down a week later. I would have been out over $20K, I got really lucky. 
Paypal is not safe either, ever hear of chargebacks? Paypal takes the buyer's side, even when they are wrong. Paypal will lock your funds as a seller for zero evidence and please don't waste our time arguing this point, I know several people with this problem. 
Credit cards online are your idea of safety? I guess so since you are a big E-Gold fan, makes sense now.

So, we are trusting hackers and stolen data with our investments now? And where was this report just a few days ago, BEFORE the breakout? Did someone not accumulate enough cheap BTC so they now need to spread rumors?
You have to assume two things, Karpeles, a known and skilled hacker, did not plant fake logs on the server (yea, that's never happened before) and the OTHER hacker that stole the data did not manipulate a single number, because that hacker was such an upstanding person with such moral fiber. 
Even if we can safely make those two assumptions, which we can't but let's keep pretending since we are already in imagination land here, all this means is that Bitcoin joins the ranks of every single other traded instrument in being manipulated. 
So, did all of those markets crash? Are they all overvalued? 
Yes, they probably are, including bitcoin, will it matter is the question?
No, it will not, whoever wanted to sell has sold, whoever wanted to buy has made that choice too over the past few months and this is the market price now, post-willie.

The link between the two is unbreakable. One cannot be separated from the other. This is not just my opinion, this is fact. 
Total Market Cap of Bitcoin / Number of Bitcoins = Price Per Bitcoin
This is the same as any stock. A bitcoin is a share of stock in Bitcoin, not some clone of bitcoin but Bitcoin in the strict sense.  
As technology based on the Bitcoin protocol expands and people begin moving money through the system the market capitalization increases. Owners of bitcoins see an increase in share price because total supply has remained the same while market cap increases, simple math shows the price per share increases.
If they used some bitcoin clone obviously we would be talking about a different company (litecoin) with different shares of stock in that company (litecoins) then that would be fine with me, I would start buying litecoins if big businesses were lining up behind it as much as they are Bitcoin.
So, now you know that bitcoin's exchange price is affected by growth in adoption of technology based on bitcoin, again bitcoin in the strict sense, because these businesses will focus on transferring money through the bitcoin network, thereby increasing market capitalization and of course, share price, see the formula above. 
EDIT: More sources, 
"Bitcoin the currency can’t be separated from Bitcoin the payment system, Barry Silbert, the founder and head of SecondMarket Inc., a New York brokerage that runs a virtual currency fund, said Jan. 14 in a phone interview. Without having the virtual currency as an asset, the system would be reliant on trust in a third-party", he said.

Uh, everything? Kashmir Hill basically lied to promote the idea that Bitcoin (and by extension all STEM) is a "boy's club". This is a cookie cutter attack used by SJWs (Kashmir included). They are starting to realize Bitcoin doesn't promote their Grand Utopian Welfare State, in fact, they are realizing it makes it impossible.  So they are beginning to run their standard playbook. See Jackson Palmer's comments recently. Soon we'll hear about Bitcoin community members sending "threats" to women and the POCs. A la gamergate.

no, not in other words, in the words I used there. Go online and learn about the voter fraud in the last election if you care. This isn't a political view to me, why is it to you? 
Politics is one thing, vote fraud is another and I can't believe it doesn't matter to you, but you are obviously on the Left based on that comment. But hey, you won right, so you don't have to care do you. 
Did you care with Bush/Gore? Of course you did, because you are a partisan hack. Typical Statist Lefty, all about politics, no principles at all.

here here!! We _do_, however, need more people like _you_ willing to call out these scammers and liars. The criticism du jour for Bitcoin lately is that it's a "boys club" and not "inclusive". Standard SJW talking points, standard playbook they run everywhere. See gamers for the most recent examples. 
I guess her and Jackson Palmer and Felix Salmon et.al. finally realized that Bitcoin makes their Socialist Utopia impossible so they have begun to attack it in the only way they know how. 
Just wait, soon we'll hear about "Bitcoin community members" sending threats to these SJWs. Just like gamergate all over again.

If it's important you won't lose it. If you do it that coin can be invalidated and a new one issued. It's on a Card, like a debit card, you slide it like you swipe a debit card into a voting machine, it's no different and they don't need to know how it works since they already know how to swipe a debit card there really isn't anything else to know. 
Sell it, fine go ahead, you missed the part where I said "one coin issued to each registered voter". So if there are 100 registered voters there will be 100 potential votes. Not everyone will vote, fine no problem. Want to sell yours, no problem, there were only a finite number anyway so there will not be any more votes at that point than otherwise. It's a zero sum game at that point. Fraud isn't possible. ID is unnecessary and it shouldn't be in 2014, I would think. 
Obviously this is just two people on the internet talking so I really don't have to sell you on anything, there is nothing to sell, I haven't invented this yet nor will I ever. 
I would think that people in a 1st world country would expect their votes to be counted just a little bit more truthfully than some Banana Republic but if you don't care then I will not waste my time caring for you. I'll move to a different country and watch this one continue to burn. 
I am just shocked that every new idea to bring honesty to the lying thieves currently occupying our government is met with such resistance, it's almost like you guys enjoy being lied to and stolen from. That money you hear about them wasting, that came out of someone's paycheck. Someone, someone's wife, someone's husband, someone's parents, worked very hard for that to be stolen and wasted or given as kickbacks. Check the State Dept. and the $6 Billion that Hillary lost (stole). Through a "vulnerability" in their contracting process, I almost thought I was reading about Mt. Gox when I heard all that money was "lost" through a "vulnerability", but NOPE, that's the good ol' government and the USD.  
Please don't continue to argue with me about this, like I said I'm not here to care for you or convince you of anything.

If you want to hold bitcoin you have two choices; buy or mine. If it's more expensive to  mine then you'll buy. If you don't want to hold bitcoin then you aren't in the market for bitcoin and therefore irrelevant to the discussion. Increasing difficulty definitely does make bitcoin more expensive to mine, can I mine with my CPU or do I need thousands of dollars worth of ASICS? When difficulty was low all I needed was my CPU, now that difficulty is high I need thousands of dollars of ASICS. If I have invested thousands in ASICS I'm not going to sell you one for less than what I put into it, but if I mined it with my CPU I might just give it away, because it was free for me basically. 
So increasing difficulty absolutely does drive the price up, it makes them harder (more expensive) to obtain. If no one wants to obtain one then we have much bigger problems. 
If gold were just laying around on the ground (low difficulty) it would be cheap. If gold requires a multimillion dollar mining investment and people with decades of experience to obtain then it would be more expensive. The "difficulty" of mining gold going up would increase the price there as well. If you wanted gold for whatever reason you would have two choices; mine it or buy it.

Rage quitting is a great sign for us traders, thanks for the good news!
Let's be honest, this market is manipulated to hell and back (like every single other market on the planet, see Libor and Barclay's for reference). 
It went from $25 to $1200 not because of some naive "natural growth" but because of pump and dump crews, just like in the "Real World". No different than any other penny stock. 
The average buy in for most of the pumpers is probably $5.00 or so.
It will not help these market manipulators at all to allow a market they fully control to just die. They still have bags and bags of coins they would love to dump on someone else's head somewhere around $900. 
My point being, bitcoin is in the despair/capitulation mode right now, because it's being pushed there by manipulators who own the market. Why would they do this? Only one reason...to pump it later. Need to shake out some of those early adopters first.

It is essential to adoption if you casually ask from time to time when you are actually making a purchase, because you are not a customer until then. I ask vendors I use for various items online if they accept bitcoin, in a non-trolling non-offensive way, and 1 of them has begun accepting it via coinbase. Now let a million people do that.

Abstract:      
We study the economics of Bitcoin transaction fees in a simple static partial equilibrium model with the specificity that the system security is directly linked to the total computational power of miners. We show that any situation with a fixed fee is equivalent to another situation with a limited block size. In both cases, we give the optimal value of the transaction fee or of the block size. We also show that making the block size a non binding constraint and, in the same time, letting the fee be fixed as the outcome of a decentralized competitive market cannot guarantee the very existence of Bitcoin in the long-term.

The abstraction principle is Bitcoin’s fatal flaw. If I possess the private key associated with a Bitcoin address, then I can trade that Bitcoin with any counterparty for value without the counterparty worrying about whether or not I am the “rightful” owner of the Bitcoin. The private key is the only “document” required to satisfy the abstraction principle at the legal heart of Bitcoin, and so long as that document is not forged (which is what blockchain is very good at preventing) then the Bitcoin issuer has absolutely zero liability to any party in a Bitcoin transaction, including the “rightful” owner of the Bitcoin.
Someone isn't ready for Bitcoin. The "rightful" owner of a Bitcoin is He Who Can Spend it, period. If you can't handle that responsibility then you are not ready for Bitcoin.
