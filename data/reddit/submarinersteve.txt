People will still trade stocks. People will trade bitcoin. They just offer the services and make money both ways. They don’t care if it suceeds or fails. But obviously if they’re interested enough to open bakkt they probably own a bit of bitcoin

Because nano is Monopoly money and a play thing. Bitcoin is real money. Shitcoins are just little projects that happen to have a little value. They aren’t money

R u dum?
Banks are supposed to have money. That’s literally why they’re banks. It’s not alarmist, it’s cause for alarm. I see what you’re saying, and understand the difference. But this is akin to a bank having their credit card maxed out and then asking for a payday advance. Usually not a good sign of financial health
