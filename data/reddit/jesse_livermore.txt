Price will need to double then to compensate the miners' loss of profitability at the block halving. From a behavioral economics viewpoint (my career's specialty actually) it'll be possible for price to double because the miners who are only in it for profits and sell their mining rewards immediately will no longer mine if it's unprofitable, leaving only the hardcore bitcoin-for-lifers who will continue mining. Only difference though is these hardcore miners ain't going to sell their rewards, they will hoard, leaving supply of bitcoin on open markets low.
So ya, you make a good point that perhaps if price doesn't increase these in-it-for-profits miners will stop mining and it'll hurt block times in the short term, however the in-it-for-life bitcoiners will gladly swoop in and hoard.

Not an investment bank, RIA, mutual fund or pension fund. 
Hint hint there is no SEC-registered bank, RIA, mutual fund nor pension fund out there that owns bitcoins outright using clients' money because there is still way too much fear of breaching a fiduciary duty of putting the client in the face of unnecessary risks which are not even SEC approved.
This is also part of the reason why the SEC is taking their sweet time to approve the WinkETF. They realize that okaying it allows these traditional investment managers to buy into it because suddenly the fiduciary duty of putting a client into what is at least an SEC-approved asset is now there. Basically it sets a strong lasting precedent across the industry that you can put grandma's milk money into bitcoin (assuming grandma wants and can sustain that kind of risk and volatility).

T+3 settlement as well as an inability by the governing body to even figure out which trades belonged with which brokers when 'black swan'-type events (ie flash crashes) occur is hardly efficient in this day and age, especially when there is a technological instrument, the blockchain, which can do it instantly and for a fraction of $15-$20 billion per year cost of infrastructure that the investment world currently pays annually to keep up the current T+3 system.
This isn't 'conspiracy theory' and is seriously being looked into by not just Byrne at Overstock but the entire investment world as a whole. 43 banks being part of R3CEV = not a conspiracy theory (

This and the Second Market ETF will be huge successes when publicly available. There has been a massive demand to add any kind of Bitcoin exposure to portfolios for about a year now but there has been no public stock, ETF or fund with material exposure to Bitcoin. This has only made Wall Street foam at the mouth even more so. 
Give it a year or two and you'll likely even see some of these well-known alt Cryptos get an ETF, too.

They will allow it because the only thing that's essentially happening here is the middle-men centralized exchanges and settlement companies are being taken out of the equation. This is sort of a reversion to what the stock market fundamentally was when traders started buying and selling shares of stock way back in history, with a ledger showing who owned how many shares. Overall, there's nothing truly complicated to really even slow down approval either. If Overstock wants shares of OSTK to be freely-tradeable on CounterParty, they'll hire the best securities lawyers out there to poke the SEC into considering it and the SEC will give some requirements and they'll be built into CounterParty (such as giving your person info away when you create a login) and before you know it OSTK will be available on CounterParty. This shit isn't rocket science nor is it going to move at the speed of the Winklevoss ETF; it's simple stuff and will put CounterParty on the financial map alongside Bitcoin pretty damn quick.

Begin cynicism. 
If 21 really plans on taking 75% of mined BTC from every first world mining appliance then this would surely make 21 have the highest current future value of any company currently in existence.... Which likely means it'll IPO 10 years from now after Silicon Valley and Wall Street backers have raked in their 10,000% returns and the public will finally be able to join in the full financial benefit of 21...at which point the stock will likely plummet and all value will disperse on to the next big thing, unavailable to the public of course. 
Way to go BTC and 21, successfully continuing this fucked up model of making the rich richer.
End cynicism.

Spreadcoin is the only non-pool-mined crypto now which the little miner can still be profitable mining.
So every other crypto is now centralized than Spreadcoin in that sense.

Really interesting observations. Minus the 'they paid off the NYT' bit I think you have nailed down that this was a well-coordinated R3 attack on bitcoin. If you know the right people in the media and you promise them exclusives on interesting stories they will no doubt print up an article of your liking.
The next step, if I were R3, is to have Mike come out and say what the better solution to bitcoin is in their opinion. Look for some major media outlet to get the scoop on that one too. And from the sounds of it, it'll probably be an ethereum-based private chain.

That's not what's being said here by this poster. He's saying the premium will disappear which means either GBTC decreases OR bitcoin price increases.
GBTC is shortable you know...Please explain then why Wall Street believes bitcoin to be worth above $600 right now per GBTC's price. 
It's my belief that the Wink ETF, if it's approved as an ETF structured similar to some gold ETF's which actually go and buy underlying good, will likely bring the overall bitcoin price up to this $600 level in the short-term thereby matching GBTC's price. 
So yes, expect the premium to evaporate but not because GBTC's price drops... But rather because the Wink ETF is spiking bitcoin demand more so than GBTC is able to do.

Basically it sets a strong lasting precedent across the industry whereby the SEC would say you can put grandma's milk money into bitcoin (assuming grandma wants and can sustain that kind of risk and volatility).
That's why the SEC's dragging their feet. Plus they've taken a hit to their reputation in allowing all these crazy-leveraged long and short ETF's which the general public really didn't seem to understand.
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:39:35
GBTC's underlying is bitcoin, regardless of the 2% fee and regardless of the shitty OTC structuring and regardless of the 18 month term length that the accredited investors who previously held them. So I truly doubt it'll swap to a discount once the Wink ETF comes out.
By the way, I trade GBTC using market orders on Scottrade  and TD without getting screwed over so I'm not sure what you mean by limit orders only aspect. Also, I can guarantee you the Wink ETF will also come with a steep 2% expense ratio. They're not going through this long exercise just to charge a minimal fee.

If the ETF is rejected the SEC will give concrete reason/s which other ETF companies will then be able to use to make their ETFs palatable to the SEC.
Essentially the SEC won't just come out and say "No BTC ETFs ever!" They are driven by logic and rationale. 
More than likely though it'll be approved, IMO. And then we'll likely have 3 or 4 more by year-end after the Wink BTC ETF has set precedent.

What's with the seemingly pussy-footing attitude prevalent around here with making big price predictions happening soon? 
This post and many other posts recently.
Look, BTC is clearly in the process of finally exiting a bear market duldrum and entering another one of its trademark ridiculous exponential rallies... And yet no one is making a large price prediction.
Here's one though: 
$15k BTC by March 2017. Why? Because this is crypto and because there are a confluence of factors coming together politically, monetarily and fiscally, and the result will be a rush into BTC.
Currently though, the interest rates on US Treasuries are giving away the biggest tell of what's ahead for the US.

This is happening... Likely by Q1 2017. The Winks see the writing's on the wall with Mary Jo resigning. 
If you have been paying attention to who's going to be in charge of the SEC on day 1 of Trump (ie no one until he nominates them) and who he has so far been putting in his various cabinet positions (ie nearly the exact opposite of the 'correct' person for each department), then this is a no brainier conclusion. I wouldn't be surprised to see none other than Madoff put in charge of Trump's SEC.

You're talking about stocks and GLD while ignoring ETN's for some reason.
Please explain why it is that ETN's track their underlying assets since you can't redeem ETN shares for their underlying. 
As far as I can tell from reading your comments you know a minimal amount about the asset-tracking index world and you're trying to convince some non-knowledgeable sheeple here to not buy GBTC based on a flimsy nonsensical SEC opinion. That would be a huge mistake, IMO. GBTC will continue to track Bitcoin with a premium for awhile. Why? Because GBTC tracks Bitcoin. Why does the dollar have any value to it? Because it has value to it.

Within the next 6 months, BTC is going to test the recent bottom from a couple months and it will successfully hold that bottom. From there it will likely come right back to this $200-$300 range and sit there for another 6 months before starting its reapproach of its ATH over the next 6 months. 
Basically you're right that it's got lower to go but you're wrong about it going sub-$100 because within a year there will be legit ETFs available, with supply unlike GBTC, on Wall Street which will take BTC to the 5-digit range with 3 years.
Set a reminder of this post and just watch...

According to page 121 of their Interim Financial Report, only 37,300 shares (about 3,730 btc) were redeemed in the third quarter 2014 and 89,600 (about 8,960 btc) shares redeemed in 9 months ending third quarter 2014.
Overall since trading in GBTC is dependent upon the current shareholders bringing their shares to market and since this is the only bitcoin etf currently available, I'd expect to see a disgustingly high premiums initially placed on these GBTC shares versus what bitstamp shows. 
Basically, current shareholders aren't stupid and will very likely only sell for ridiculous asking prices and IMO early purchases here of GBTC will be screwed if they go too far above price that bitstamp shows...
I'm holding off until more volume or the other BTC etfs arrive.

I read these fun disclosures for a living... Here's what I see: 
GBTC is setup in a typical ETF fashion. The only red flags are the fees (2% per year) and the exchange.... Over the counter will scare away many institutions and investment advisors because the OTC market has a bad rap sheet for having scams, swindlers and creating many suckers so unless investment advisors get the client to signoff on purchasing GBTC compliance departments will likely red-flag any attempted purchases.
Overall this means that GBTC likely won't see an asset flow similar to what GLD saw at first. The amateurs and TD Ameritrade folks will likely flock to it but the pros will likely have to give it more time, perhaps 12 months, to prove to their compliance departments that it's not a typical scammy OTC asset and that Silbert's team knows what they're doing in running it.
Personally I'm excited at the prospect of putting my tax-free IRA dollars into this fund.
