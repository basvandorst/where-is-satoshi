How can they tax if I’m not taking profit?
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:56:18
Nope bitcoin can’t be duplicated, but you can fork the hell out of it.
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:00:59
I hodl. I’m not paying shit.
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:05:10
Same here didn’t even sell
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:58:33
You’re looking at the month timeline dude.
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:13:52
Stop hurting yourself. It will all be over soon.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:41:21
Copy the address?
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:41:01
Are you high
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:01:48
Not now lol
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:37:52
Your all wrong it’s bitcoinz 
@_date: 2019-07-27 00:02:18
It’s about losing it.
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:12:13
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:44:27
More like SECsiest 
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:52:09
How did you type this...
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:07:32
That’s freaking awesome.
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:22:01
I’m not sure but I know it’s faster
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:32:59
Buy bitcoin with the cash app
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:50:53
Please don’t start this.
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:53:20
Baby what though...
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:40:50
Why the hell didn’t he lie?
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:27:26
To the MOOO!!.... ditch.
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:43:31
I usually tell my wife it’s better than hookers and the returns I get won’t leave her with an itchy crotch.
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:58:24
Your teeth are perfect
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:40:21
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:05:58
Sweet as!
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:13:31
Lol it doesn’t 
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:00:03
That’s amazing
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:30:12
Those are at my grocery store lol
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:45:42
Wait for cash app to get fixed. It’s worth it
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:59:31
Nice try but I can tell the difference between my wife and your wife’s tits with my eyes closed...
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:37:03
I still told your wife she had great tits.
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:03:36
I was hoping you’d catch that haha
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:00:45
It’s happened more than once, and I have to admit it is a little annoying. But if I try again in an hour or so, it’s usually working. I can’t stomach coinbase or even Abra after using cash app. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:29:30
A car
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:18:09
I’m just teasing by the way it’s pretty cool LOL
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:15:55
I usually only put art on my wall that appreciate in value. Did your kindergartener make that?
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:42:21
Trends don’t reverse, they rotate.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:22:34
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:07:04
Obviously you learned nothing from 2018. And have you ever heard of a natural disaster?
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:28:01
Could you layer the lower images? Make Btc somewhat opaque haha totally gonna be the new meme
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:11:34
Sounds like a china thing to do...
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:09:07
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:25:05
Just accumulate. There’s no need to trade.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:14:05
Who cares
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:56:18
Donate it to the poor
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:19:59
Very nice
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:49:13
No it’s not. If your in the USA get the cash app and start storing it there on the app.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:12:03
I use cash app and I love it except for today. Slow af right now it’s been 10 hours since my withdrawal and still haven’t gotten the confirmation email.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:16:42
There you go.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:31:40
I always thought of this!
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:15:46
Just leave it in cash app
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:10:19
Same way you would explain it to a five year old
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:34:04
Fooood fiiiiight!
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:36:09
Yeah they renew the energy into bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:38:35
I have one in my mall and I thought I was the only one using it during 2018. Went in the other day and I kid you not, I had to wait in line.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:23:43
Yeah but there’s fees on coinbase too.
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:52:30
The only way
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:12:24
What’s the point of showing us your funds on an exchange that you can afford to lose? All your doing is phishing. Many people hold funds in binance. I do not. It’s my gateway to buy more but I transfer into my ledger right after. I highly doubt your trading.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:53:18
I didn’t care lol
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:07:46
Isn’t it suppose to go the other way around?
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:46:32
I want nothing do with your paper embodiment of the devil himself.
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:33:11
Not in this market lol
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:31:19
Real value is what you pay
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:13:48
Lambosaurus. Definitely from the hodlassic period.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:42:43
It’s 
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:12:51
Yeah I heard they’re seriously looking into verge lol
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:59:23
Sweet! Why do you think one is there?
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:59:30
No... Yakima like near nowhere in Washington 
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:01:47
I think they need a rebrand
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:53:31
When the likelihood is 50%, is it also unlikely?
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:33:58
Very funny
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:52:27
I was kidding given their history
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:02:39
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:39:53
I tried to search a coin but it doesn’t search
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:19:38
My child.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:32:16
Very unlikely
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:28:52
So, bitcoin does hurt the environment?
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:44:27
No one knows man
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:15:57
With the advance of social media I feel we’re a further along than this.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:24:23
Profit from what?
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:25:59
There you go!
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:01:31
How are ideas bulletproof? Ideas come from brains which are not bulletproof. Mind blown, pun intended.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:21:58
Ok I see your point. I was thinking more along the lines of adoption.
