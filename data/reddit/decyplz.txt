Thanks so much for your reply.  I don't have a substantial income, it's less than $60k and I'm on a 1099.  Next year, I should make about $10k-$20k more.  In this case, your suggestion is to withdraw my bitcoin money this year and pay the 23.8% tax cap gains tax.  And I have to pay this tax before January 15th?

Wow, nullc, I really appreciate your guidance on this.  I’m sure you’re helping many others (like nishat below) with your responses.
Ok, to summarize—
I’m making less than $275k next year (I’m married, but my wife makes less than I do), so I would pay 15% for fed tax cap long term gains and 9.3% to the State.  That’s a whopping 24.3% total (in you example of $10k profit, I would pay $2430).  However, I have not held Bitcoin for over a year, I was introduced to it just a few months ago (October/November).  That means the fed marginal rate is 25% (34.3% when added with CA tax, I would pay $3430), so it would be beneficial to wait until next year (Oct/Nov 2018) to report my cap gains so I can get the 15% rate.  I would follow your same instructions in paying the taxes before Jan 15, 2019.
This is also my first year on a 1099, so I actually didn’t know I was supposed to pay taxes quarterly.  I’ll probably have to pay penalties, so I have to look into that further.

For those of you that were hodling bitcoin for several years -- what does this crash compare to from the past?  I've only been following bitcoin for a little over 2 months, and there have been tons of dips and flash crashes, but this one has been the biggest, by far.
