Can we agree on what "moon" pricing is? Really. 
I think, because its a nice round TWO digit (or 5 depending) is 10k. 10k is moon? is it 25k?

Don't. Look. At. Exchanges. All. Day. Long. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:12:05
All exchanges have problems man... all of them. 
If you dont like coinbase thats fine. But for people that do crypto as a side investment, its a GREAT place to start. Its FDIC insured for your money sitting in the USD wallet, its easy to use, its app is great...

no they just support making sure if they do x2 that customers get access to both coins

sorry were all not trying to evade taxes. If I want to hide my BTC I know how too.
Not to mention anyone using COINBASE has already given up that information

you cant even adjust your balances via fidelty, it just displays the values. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:58:58
How exactly is a refund provided in BTC? Do they give you the cash value and you can buy your own damn BTC? HMM?
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:18:21
lmao, its just displaying your balance... also fidelty is well known and trusted 3rd party invenstment tool... a ton of large corps manage their employee 401ks in fidelty
