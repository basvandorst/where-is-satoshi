Yes, when you put your info into paypal, stripe etc, you are archived in their systems forever. Do you know what that means? Tracked and traced. All of your buying habits are sold off. Crypto allows ways around this. I sell hats with Btc logos and Bitcoin Cash logos. If you’re in the US, I’ll give you a discount and you can pay for the shipping. Just PM me.

Yes. A customer actually gave me the idea. He called it a head warmer and I thought that was really cool.

I dare you go to r/privacy or r/Monero and say this. Let’s see how that works out for you. I had to screenshot this. I never thought I’d meet someone in a crypto community that doesn’t value privacy. Sad!

Not overpriced and I have had tons of happy clients. Actually, mines are cheaper than a lot I’ve seen on other platforms. Yes, putting a bitcoin symbol on a this material COST and going to get the material COST and going to make them COST. Please ���� Tons of people have supported me and are happy that they can finally spend their crypto without being tracked and traced.
