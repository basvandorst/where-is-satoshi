The longest chain of valid Bitcoin blocks. A Bitcoin block is a block that is valid according to the consensus rules ~~as implemented by the Bitcoin software maintained by the Bitcoin Core developers and as released on the bitcoin.org website~~.

I don't think there is anything stopping it. I think this could technically be done on both chains, right now, tbh--but the incentives are all wrong on BCH. Plus, it seems like LN is paving the way. Could be a tinfoil hat sort of thing, but it has def caused me some sleepless nights.

How do you imagine L2/L3 to work wo centralization? What is your vision for the tech? From what I've read p2p channels seem really impractical and the only way they scale to this level is to have highly connected LN middlemen to which users would subscribe. Worse, this type of system makes it possible for fractional reserve systems (that use L1 as a settlement layer) to arise. I don't know if it's possible to prevent that sort of thing with code... I've been trying to think of a way and I'm coming up short.  If that type of system can emerge you better believe that it will. :'(
Remember that decentralization isn't the goal--censorship resistance is the goal. Decentralization is a fantastic tool, but not necessarily one that needs be maximized.

Notice how quickly 80K transactions were squashed. Notice that the majority of those transactions had negligible fees. Notice that with 8MB blocks, the blocks are only that large when the volume requires it.

No... the blockchain will only be 8X bigger if there are 8 times as many transactions going through it. 8MB blocks does not mean that EVERY block is 8MB, they only grow that big if there are enough transactions to justify it. If the number of transactions is the same, the blockchain will be approximately the same size even if you had 1GB blocks--the only difference being that transactions on the chain with the larger blocks would be picked up much quicker. Now in reality, an increase to 8MB on the BTC chain would result in a bigger blockchain, but only because more people would be using it due to the lowered fees. It may eventually end up at the same price-point as we are currently experiencing, but in that case transaction throughput would be 8X the current rate.
There is definitely a balance to be struck. Where that is exactly, is what the market is currently determining.

If you hold any Bitcoin Cash (BCH), you can use that to pay to have your pending transactions accelerated at (iirc) BTC.com, ViaBTC.com and bitcoin.com. I think some of those may accept credit cards, too.

The majority of bitcoin holders with a cypherpunk ethos hang out at r/btc. You won't find much in the way of free thought here.
