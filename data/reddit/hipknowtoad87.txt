Why does he focus so much on whether or not Bitcoins can be "money"? If you don't want the SEC to regulate something, you argue that that "something" is not a security, under the 33 Act. 
He also, I think, misstated Howey. That case only dealt with what is considered an "investment contract." If he wasn't misstating it, he was confusing what exactly the court was defining. 
If you purchase Bitcoins with $$, then you may be entering an investment contact (assuming the other two elements are satisfied, which is a whole other argument). The $$ you use to buy Bitcoins is the "money" referred to in the Howey test.  
I guess I'm wondering, how would speculating on Bitcoins be any different from speculating with other currencies? 
ACTUALLY HE'S RIGHT. Bitcoins wouldn't be regulated by the SEC...it would be the CFTC...IF a Bitcoin could be a "commodity." I'd like to write a paper on this actually. Thank you for the article. 
Disclosure: I kinda wrote this while reading. Stream of consciousness kind of thing

The shareholder isn't at risk. The share issuer is at risk of SEC action if they've "distributed" a "security," which the shares most likely are. If the shareholder further distributes an unregistered share that has not been exempt, then they would need to worry.
Also, they (exchanges) aren't illegal until they've been deemed so by a regulator. From what I've read, SEC has been silent about exchanges from a securities POV. However, FINCEN did make a definitional recommendation regarding exchanges as currency exchanges.

This is actually a great idea. Start with a way for the public to pay for small things with bitcoins. Start with parking in city lots, maybe move towards paying for tickets with bitcoins next.
