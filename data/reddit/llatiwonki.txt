Wow, you da man. Is there a curated place I can find all airdrops?

That makes a lot more sense. We need ubiquity in the sense of people becoming comfortable buying/investing in something they do not understand. One way or another.

So much untapped money imo

Did you buy straight from the company or through a 3rd party? Thought they were sold out?

This is absolute gold.  Especially since at least 4k other people are going to be doing the exact same thing.

THis is about bitcoin, I’m not sure why it would be flagged.

If you don't think they are holding at least that much BTC right now, you're terribly mistaken.

Right or left?

Can't trust those figures....same reason I sold Weibo

Likely see one chain take all the hash power.  The safest thing for you to do is to do nothing post fork, especially to protect yourself from replay attacks.

This may be the dumbest post I've ever seen. Why would you ever publicly post something like this.

CryptoMarket360 has a daily news podcast that covers the last 24 hours of credible crypto news usually pretty quickly, under ten minutes.

This is just the beginning.

It's like the crypto mafia spreading this garbage. I feel bad for the people that get their news from Kelly on CNBC shilling btrash constantly.

That's all it took?
