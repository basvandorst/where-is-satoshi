I appreciate the use of no-one expects the Spanish Inquisition line.

Good post.
I missed the fork as a newbie to crypto. I pulled up at the gym and saw BCH was added to Coinbase. I went to put in $50 just to gain some exposure. Couldn’t buy at $3k. After working out I saw and was pissed that the price was up 182%.
I was looking to get in and get out, but I think I’ll just watch BCH from the sidelines.

I appreciated the don’t worry, BCH will get that high soon enough.
Only for Ver.

I still want to have BCH on hand because I like diversifying. However, this is now two blatant pump and dumps where the common person gets left holding the bag after a parabolic rise.

You forgot to include you wearing khakis with white dad shoes.

Thank you. I’m new to Bitcoin. Bought at ATH last week then bought more at the dip. This post makes me feel better about sticking with Bitcoin as a former Peter Schiff Gold acolyte who rebuked Bitcoin in 2015.
Great informative post.

I’ve noticed something similar (I’m new to Bitcoin too).
Your initial purchase includes fees. So if you purchase $100, your fees are taken out of that $100, not added to the $100.
Likewise, I notice that Coinbase runs at a premium too. That is, on GADX or HODL, the price might be $8,000 but Coinbase has a price ~$100 more. I can only assume this is because you’re buying at Market Price and not a Limit Price.

Oh you mean Peter Schiff who was against bitcoin in 2014 but a few months ago said he bought some even tho he was pumping his gold.

I see what you did there. ��

Good thing they bought it before the dip.
