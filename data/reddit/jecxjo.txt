I think the reason people like to poke holes in this concept is because the ones who are coming up with this idea are completely missing **HUGE** holes.
This **WILL NOT** be a global network. The technology price range just does not exist to run from State to State/Country to Country for the average user. It took the US military, lots of Universities and huge communication corporations to get the internet up and running. Hundreds of billions of dollars.
People need to understand that if you are going to not use the ISP and current infrastructure you will be looking at nodes the cover your city or town and that is it. Does OP explain this or even give notice to this issue. No.
Reliability requires huge, high bandwidth infrastructures. We only get the fast bandwidth we do today because there are enough pipes to funnel all that traffic through and they are made from high quality systems and maintained constantly. Downloading Youtube videos over hundreds of hops on Wifi routers just will not stand up. Even our current ISPs sometimes have difficulties and they get tons of our money and still do a piss poor job.
Providing incentives for work is a great idea but requires fast, smart networks. As we have seen with Bitcoin, eventually the incentives will start to go to those who have the money and resources to provide these types of networks. This means that all the local players will eventually quit because they will see no incentives and be required to do a lot of work. If I'm the guy who creates a connection from Chicago to St. Louis then I'm going to have a lot of bandwidth usage and get a lot of money. But the guy providing access for his suburb or his neighborhood will not be seeing a dime because there will only be a fixed amount of money from advertisers/investors and those will only go to the high bandwidth players. When the local players quit the only one still making money is the high bandwidth nodes and they will have to deploy their own local service to keep existing users. Eventually you end up with individuals owning large areas.
These are just a few of the many big holes that are not addressed. OP and his buddies should stop thinking about the tech, stop thinking about how to link every flippin' idea with Bitcoin and try to figure out how they will connect one mesh with another for less cost than what I need to pay my ISP for "Premium" internet.

I've never understood if OP understands that their idea only works for local intranets. There won't be some global, wireless mesh network connecting London to LA, its going to only be your local city.
And if OP does understand this then they are really bad at explaining it to users because people would either realize what this idea can and can't do or would come to the conclusion that this really does not solve any problem. I want to email my friend in London and I live in the US...can't do it with BitCloud.

I think the part people are not understanding is that this is not creating an internet replacement. It will be creating lots of local intranets. You will not be able to communicate from New York to Los Angeles. You will only be able to communicate with your community.
Any kind of long range (state to state, country to country) communication will either be non-existant (most likely case) or very very very slow.

Traveling...that will never work. Which is fine, as long as it is explained. But as soon as they say "We are coming up with another Mesh Network" no one will care.
Same issue with decentralization. Anyone who's ever used Torrents will know that unless and file is highly in demand, seeders eventually drop out. With decentralization, unless you force many many copies, the odds of your data not being available is going to be high.
I have a feeling this is the same group of guys who are constantly pushing all this Mesh Network/cjdns stuff. They like the math and code behind all it but never fully understand that it is not a practical idea. Someone further down the post commented about how "its great you are thinking about this stuff, even if you fail it will provide useful information." Sadly, I don't feel this is the case. They are too obsessed with the areas that don't really matter that any real enlightenment about the situation will be lost in the ramblings about non-practical ideas.

No matter where you live you will only have access to your local mesh. This is not going to be global. Install a Wifi access point in your town of 100 people and you have a local network of...you guessed it....100 people. Not really as useful as they are suggesting.
Your little town is 100 miles away from a major city. You'll either a) have to use an ISP to get access to them or b) figure out some long range wireless connection and trust me that solution is going to be crazy expensive if not near impossible for an individual to implement.
