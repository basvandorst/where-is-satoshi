I’m between recreational and semi. I’m not good enough to be a full semi- largely because the stakes I am a comfortable winner at are too small. I have another job, and I stipend my earnings there with poker money.

I don’t think you understand the nature of poker BTC clients. It’s as safe as having your money in a banks: even though you don’t have the physical key to he liquidated form of your funds

The real question I’m asking is whether it would be more profitable to keep my stuff in the acc or run away with the cash now. I still play USD on another site- I’ve just been playing Bitcoin lately. Additionally: the BTC is safe in this client, which is important to note.

I am aware I’m an idiot in terms of crypto currency- however you aren’t aware of the limitation of a bankroll. As a poker player, our life supply is a bankroll. I am not using the site as a bank, I have no choice but to store it there and play from it. I can’t just withdraw it and deposit every time I need to play. 
To respond to your concern- yes, they could do that. However online poker isn’t a gruesome Wild West world (yes, poker stars are assholes, and full tilt shut down), but these are regulated companies, not scams. I am aware of the risk, I just think it’s extremely low. 
**edit: I used insured improperly. I meant to say that I’m getting a pay out, regardless of whether the company goes down or not. This has happened in the past with other poker clients in which payouts were forced by the government. I must admit to being mostly ignorant in the context and situation, but it’s enough for me not to be worried too mich**

Yea. It’s like a bank, the site is backed up with financial insurance.
