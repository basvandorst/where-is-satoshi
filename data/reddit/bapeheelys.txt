You don't *have* to. You can buy from people instead of exchanges, though usually at a premium and with added risk. If you really wanted to, you could also exchange cash for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:50:08


No, that's gambling. You are taking a risk.    
 
You said it yourself, the market can move in one of two ways: up or down. Are you telling me that you are able to *confidently* predict which way the market will swing? I don't think you can. If it was that easy everyone would be rich. Of course you might get lucky and win sometimes, but not all of the time. I'm not saying there isn't money to be made here, but there is a significantly higher risk when it comes to short-term trading vs long-term holding. Some people are happy to take that risk, some aren't. 


Conversely, if you sold at $15.5k and the market didn't drop back to $15k then you would also be missing potential profits and the holder would still be seeing nothing but profit. If you decide to buy back when the price is higher, then *boom*, there goes even more money.    
Both methods are still gambling in a way. Historically over a long enough period of time the price of BTC has always increased. This is why holders hold. The daily dips/spikes don't matter to holders.

Everyone holds different opinions. The truth is, _nobody knows_. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:54:35
The market is very unstable. QuadrigaCX only accounts for one of the many exchanges out there right now. The price will theoretically always fluctuate either until Bitcoin is worthless or there is no more money to put into Bitcoin, if that ever happens.

Are you? I'm not claiming he has x coins. You are. I'm just quoting what Satoshi said, "*It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on*" - why would the _creator_ of Bitcoin say this and not keep any? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:06


I can't think of a way to do that without entrusting someone, or a group of people with access to your money. There is no way for a computer to programatically and verifiably know whether someone is dead or not.

LN support in near future too. Bitcoin will become a viable currency again. A lot of alts will become even more useless.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:16
Proof, please?  


enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy. 
Satoshi knew what Bitcoin would become. I don't doubt that he owns a lot, lot more than 100 BTC.

I wonder what the next bubble will look like.  
Can't wait.

No, you sent me speculation. Not proof. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:06:17


Trading is only profitable if you can sell higher than when you bought in. I don't care who you are, you can't predict the cryptocurrency markets. Trading is, and has always been arguably more risky than the buy-and-hold strategy. Not to say buy-and-hold is completely risk free, of course.

Unless the owner of those coins is storing them in a way in which their family or people that they trust can access them in case of death, then the coins are probably gone.

Every time I visit all of the top posts are just people telling you why not to buy bitcoin, why bitcoin is going to fail etc. I never see any discussions actually related to bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:34
If history is any indicator, unfortunately not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:07:05
This is one of the key points, in my opinion. A lot of people just see Bitcoin as a store of value nowadays. There's nothing wrong with that, just like there's nothing wrong with saving your fiat money.
In recent years we've seen a lot of people in countries experiencing severe inflation resort to storing their wealth in Bitcoin just so that the $50 they earned this week isn't worth $5 next week. In Venezuela particularly it's very difficult to send money in to, or out from the country because of tight regulations. In some cases this would even be considered breaking the law. Bitcoin makes life easier for these people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:53:57


Once there's less money coming in and going out. This won't happen until the cryptocurrency world grows to the point where it overtakes fiat money in my opinion, if that ever happens.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:55:37
Bitcoin is a currency to you, right? Just like your dollar or whatever currency you use is. Do you spend all of your money? If not, I’m honestly kind of pissed at you for saving. How dare you do what you want with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:23:39
The global economy is far more complicated than that. Your simple math doesn't apply, I'm afraid. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:54:37
Okay... it’s insured by the same paper money. Which is also worthless. 
Where were you trying to go?

No. There are a number of possible attack vectors.  
Always generate private keys which you intend on using offline.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:08
I don't think too many more coins will be lost. Anyone who has ever mined or bought coins probably realises what Bitcoin is worth nowadays. Coins lost due to theft will likely be redistributed back into the BTC ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:42
No. You seem to be completely missing the point. I'm quoting Satoshi himself. Not anyone else.   
Yes, Gregory Maxwell is speculating. I don't care if he knew Satoshi personally many years ago. He doesn't know how many coins Satoshi has, and you don't know how many coins Satoshi has. Just like I don't know how many coins you have. Such is the nature of Bitcoin.

Why sell a shovel when you can use it to dig for gold? 
Because digging for gold is unpredictable and risky. You're guaranteed a quick ROI if you just sell the shovel at a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:51
No, that'd pose as a significant security risk. It is your responsibility to back up your keys.  


Your private keys are usually stored locally on your computer or hardware wallet. The seed just generates the private keys. You can also write down your seed or keys on a piece of paper if you want a physical copy of them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:07
That's up for you to decide. It's a risky game. Historically, taking that risk has always paid off given enough time. You can't predict the future though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:12:54
The truth is, nobody knows. Nobody can predict the market, short-term or long-term. All you can do is make assumptions.
I personally believe that the price will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Will it dip in the coming weeks/months? Maybe. The growth we've had recently isn't normal, it's bound to slow down at one point.
Or maybe it'll keep rising to the moon and you'll regret not buying in earlier.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:25:35
People are also losing their keys, sending money to the wrong addresses, and thefts are always happening. So many coins are being lost every day, limiting the supply further.

That bot became ChangeTip, which is now dead. They still allow for withdrawals though. Visit their website, click Reddit, and input your receiving address.

You got tipped Bcash, not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:50:36
Segwit2x is hapenning soon and the blockchain is forking. You will keep the Bitcoin that you hold during the fork, however you will also now have access to the same amount of coins on the segwit2x blockchain (B2X). This isn’t specific to Coinbase, I’d imagine several services offer it and if you hold the private keys yourself you have access to the coins right away.

I'll eat my nut if it hits 40k by the end of the year. Who could be so silly as to believe that?
Oh wait.. that's probably not the best idea.

BSD, much like all other *nix operating systems, as well as Windows and Mac OS, has had a lengthy history of security vulnerabilities.   
Your OS doesn't matter in the slightest. If you're an idiot, your coins will get stolen.

Obviously it would be unwise to take their advice seriously given that they aren't involved whatsoever.  
With that being said, that doesn't mean you should take everything that you read on here to heart. It is best to make the decision for yourself, it's your money after all.  
One thing that stands true is that you should never invest more than you are willing to lose. Nobody can predict the future, the price could continue to rise, or it could crash due to unforeseen circumstances. Do your own research, set your own limits, and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:18:12


Right, because it's not like Mac OS was built on top of BSD...
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:15:43
Enjoy it. You took a risk and it paid off.
BTC would be nowhere if it wasn’t for people like you using it. 
Hopefully we’ll see an even happier you at the next moon. :^)
