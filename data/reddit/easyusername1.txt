Thank you for your input, it is useful and interesting, but that does not make this list "rubbish", it may contain some inaccuracies but it is mostly correct and we thank OP for his work. He can be simply modifying it according to such useful inputs as yours.

Don't mind Coinbase haters. Coinbase is great and safe, it is a fully US licensed and regulated company, they store 99% of the bitcoins offline, 100% secure, and they have a great Vault service. I've been very happy with their service for years (I'm not associated in any way with Coinbase other than as a customer, and don't know anyone working there).

Web-bot has been spot on regarding bitcoin prices. It is forecasting a "bitcoin party" or January due to (among other things) a global spike in interest rates and bonds collapsing.

This is good news, the miners and core bitcoin developers finally agreed to a plan for a soft fork now, analyze data and a hard fork with a block increase in one year. Sounds great to me, war is over, bitcoin price will keep rising from here.

@_date: 2016-02-09 07:19:30
Hyperbole. Bitcoin has been stable for long time now, and with the "halvening" coming soon, the price will probably  go higher.

I think this will have a big effect in his millions of followers, they follow his word as gospel. This is great for bitcoin. I see a price increase related to this in one week from now, when all of them get new wallets or sign in to Circle or Coinbase and are able to buy.

@_date: 2016-10-22 14:29:44
I get your point and is very valid in the short term, but when you follow long term there are *possible* patterns that should not be dismissed apriori. So, nothing wrong to point out spikes on the data, even when that data is probably manipulated. If you draw a conclusion in the long term is precisely because you studied the 'fake' data.
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:25:01
*check history. Yep! new 100% troll account.
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:39:39
The point is that you can actually compare when it's apples to apples. So if you follow the "fake" volume, you see the differences and spikes in fluctuation.
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:27:00
It reached up to 20,000 btc/hr, fastest speed I have seen there.
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:18:07
I understand fake volumes. The point still stands, using your own example: If I follow a liar over enough time, it does not matter if he is lying in one or two individual episodes, we can make an average of his 'lies' and draw conclusions when he starts lying more than usual. In this case, there s a reason to point out that there is much higher 'fake' volume coming from China when the average fake volume is much lower and consistent.
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:30:40


No, I recognised your name from your constant and frequent negative posts against bitcoin. So didn't even need to tag your new account. You spend so much time here exclusively bashing bitcoin, that is not a normal behavior.
