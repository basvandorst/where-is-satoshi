Following your "really weird wallet" (1Lm4q3JN...), we go one further to what appears to be another "accumulator account": [16mjBqENJ9UqYW9sXyaTJZhYb57wfjNqZ4]( though it's got a relatively small balance (78 BTC, about $40k).  I've seen bigger.

Disclaimers:  about half of what I know about Bitcoin I've picked up in the past few hours, and it's still negligible.
That said, tracing these transactions it seems like things end up in some bucket / accumulator accounts, passing through a large number of intermediaries.
The traceability of transactions seems like it could well work against this guy (or guys), but only if the identity/ies can be cracked.
I've been tracing some of the bigger movements on the theory that they'd end up accumulating somewhere eventually.  Useful stuff:  you can filter transactions by send and receive.  You can also view the balance history of accounts.
One of the accumulator accounts is here, "HA1Ck":  [1EBHA1ckUWzNKN7BMfDwGTx6GKEbADUozX](  Note that this is the "All time" history, but transactions start on or about 25 November, 2013.  Immediately 30,000 BTC are transferred in, with the final total ending up at around 41,000 BTC.
By contrast, "1Drt3c" (which I've come to call "dirt") shows a full time history here:  [1Drt3c8pSdrkyjuBiwVcSSixZwQtMZ3Tew](  There are some early transactions , then a few big movements in August / September, 2012.  Things _really_ start picking up in May, 2013.
Here's a typical pass-through account.  There's a single incoming transaction (2014-02-06 13:25:04), and three outgoing TXs (2014-02-06 17:25:26).  Two are for ~0.03 BTC ($24 and $28), the third is for ~22 BTC ($17,305).  One hypothesis is that the two small payments were to associates who'd helped set up the account or otherwise facilitate the transaction, possibly unknowingly.  Or skimming by members of the team ($28 times many, many transactions could add up).
If I follow that transaction line (to the max recipient) we eventually end up at [1Kr5vYUWR5W2zX5c7UKWBcpJjmPx5W5bBU]( which exhibits an oddity:  this account receives 2.04268209 BTC ([2014-02-08 23:46:37]( and pays _out_ 91.09238209 BTC (2014-02-08 23:52:12).  I've seen this pattern elsewhere.  Odd.  But a bunch of penny-ante BTC transactions (well, if $1000 TXs can be penny-ante) suddenly jump to $62k.  Let's follow that...
Another account with zero balance, but [it's had a significant balance](  Transactions start September, 2013, and zero out in February, 2014.
One chain ends here:  [1JU3iYTcCeB34TLCN7XYwHDbDmVwnThjaK]( with a 971 BTC balance.
Another here:  [1HiLGVR7T8siQVs4X5hSdWx15C5mW2JtSm]( balance: 10,084.17667 BTC.  But also a 35,998 BTC payout [2014-02-12]( $23.9 million.  That chain ends here: [1F5N5kz8RMEYWjMYJVjnxQwD8Z8NVW3qiW](   [One transaction]( 33,878.9999 BTC.  Not a bad day's work.  Only 5% of the missing amount though.  IP relay through Italy, apparently.
Off to some more chains and transactions...
[A small accumulator TX]( -- 36 addresses contributing a total of 10.2 BTC ($8,070)
[Another accumulator](  Two big payouts in early December, and Frebruary
An endpoint from there:  [1EogffKJZjtuBwQtJzYzmDfeekafG3Gwyc]  ( though I suspect it's a waypoint.  [The transaction just occurred 10 hours ago](  About a half-million dollars.
[Endpoint]( 971 BTC 10 hours ago.
Endpoint / accumulater with ~2000 BTC (about $1 million):  [1BLqSWgYaZRV6EZGW1TiAHcFUCKh8qG3M1](  This shows up on several transaction paths.
Lots more, but that's what I'm seeing so far.
Edit: Verbs tenseses.

Now _that_ is a really interesting point.
Even more significant than the processor fees would be the freedom from chargeback risks.  Once you're paid in btc, you're paid, no?  Modulo a few minutes for the blockchain to update.
This does suggest the possibility of escrow services stepping in to fill that role, but so long as they can stay below CC's processor fee rates _and_ be clear of chargebacks, it's still a net win.

Taxes are a substantial amount of total spending -- the US federal budget is 26% of total GDP.  That's a lot of transactional support for the value of dollars.
