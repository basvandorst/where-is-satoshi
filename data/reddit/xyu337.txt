Ethereum is not a digital currency, as stated in their white paper. It is a platform to launch ICO scams. The purpose of ethereum is to make themselves rich, so they did not care about the future at all, today ethereum block chain is already several times bigger than bitcoin , and its growing at an increasing rate, it will reach 1t pretty soon, they are so busy at launching icos and cryppto kitties, no one cares about how long it will last.
Bitcoin is designed to be sound money, ethereum is a   make me rich quick scheme by a small group of people.

Why? because it does not work.
1MB is fine, so is 2MB, and so is 4MB, 8MB, and so on. There will ALWAYS be a pressure to increase the bandwidth. If Satoshi had set the blocksize to 10MB you would be screaming for a increase to 20 now.
At what point do you think it's not fine anymore? Or you think 1 TB block is also fine?
Also there is such a thing called hard fork, every time you increase the block size, you create one more bitcoin, which one is the real bitcoin? it will depend on how the community think.
Mind you that bitcoin is a distributed system, no one is in control of it, and no one can enforce the community to accept anything. A hard fork to 2MB if not done correctly, will just be a split to create a new altcoin.

When you make an onchain transaction, you use your private key to sign to prove that you own the funding belong to the sending address. When you open a LN channel, both party will need to sign with their private key, they have effective proved their ownership of their private keys. With both party has their private key authenticated, they when use their private key to alter the fund in channel without committing a transaction onchain, because we are now certain both parties has agreed to a change as long as both signed with their proven private keys.

I have to disagree here. The hype will affect price, but it's not that related to transaction numbers, which is the need to move bitcoins. why the fall of price will cause people to transact less? it doesn't make any sense, in fact when you have big dips like this, it will cause people to move their coins to exchanges therefore increase the transaction volume.    
The only explanation is that scammers fear a total market collapse and stopped attacking.
The whole "full mempool" show was staged by malicious parties to push an agenda, in reality there aren't that many real transactions to fill the mempool.

You are naive to think 2mb or 8mb will be enough to support all the demands for on chain transactions. Again even if we started off with 10mb block size, we will still have this debate.
The issue of scaling is too contentious at the moment, any attempts to  hard fork will result in an alt coin, like all the forked coins out there, would this do any good to bitcoin?

Right, Certain people pushed their ego, and his name is Roger Ver/Jihan Wu/Brian Armstrong. Or who is on the other side? Can you name one person? Let's assume HK agreement materialized and we forked into a 2MB coin, now we will have 3 coins: legacy 1mb coin, HK 2mb coin, and BCash, 3 camps is better than 2 camps I guess?
If bitcoin started with 10mb block, we would still have the same problem now, not several years down the road. The growth of bitcoin is exponential, so is the demand for block spaces.

No. None of my friends who sold their bitcoins during 2014 bear were able to buy back later , they all missed this bull run. think about it, if you bought at 1000 and panic sold at 500, would you buy back when it dips to 200? No! You will think it's going to 0. Would you buy back when it bounce to 600? No, if so  why sold at 500? In the end they will missed the boat completely.

Apart from security issues there is another aspect to it. A lot of exchanges do not charge trading fees, they make money by manipulating the market. It's a bit like fractional reserve banking, based on how many bitcoins they have they can conjure up magic coins to dump on the market hoping to tank it for a profit. 
They are the reasons behind the pboc sharp fall. Any time when pboc are to make move these guys has inside info and has prepared for it. Do you really think China or pboc has a huge interest in bring down bitcoin? No, bitcoin is too small for them, its speculators who want bitcoin down to make a profit. They are collaborating with exchanges on this, and they can do this because your deposited coins.
So, for the sake of yourself and the community, please get your own wallet.

When you open an account on major Chinese exchanges you must enter your personal info , accessible by gov agencies. When you withdraw to your own address they would know this is your address.

Be very careful about this. The "bitcoin" you can't withdraw are not real bitcoins, its simply a number on their computer, which comes in infinitely supply. The value of "bitcoin" lies with a promise that they will allow you to withdraw later, which is uncertain. If they don't allow you to withdraw forever then this "bitcoin" worth nothing.

You don't understand the whole thing, do you? 
You have a centralized sql database you can do instant transactions. If this is what you want then just use paypal, paypal is one infinitely large block where transactions are confirmed instantly, so paypal is much better?

There are different forums for each camp in English speaking world, in China there is only 8btc.com. It's more balanced. Jihan has a strong influence there, many people believe bu is for further development of bitcoin while core is holding it back.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:41:54
AiscBoost is not that important.
Jihan is a very forward looking businessman, you can't be shortsighted yet become so successful at bitcoin mining. 
The reason for Jihan's fondness of large blocks lie in the very nature of mining businesses-- it is naturally centralizing. A mining node runs in a dominating mining pool is much more efficient than a node of same configuration but runs remotely, because of network latency.
If PoW algorithm does not change, large mining pools will kill off smaller ones on a long run, larger blocks will speed up this process, because it's slower to propagate larger blocks on network.
Jihan's advandatge in asic making is temporary, where will be bigger players come into this market, producing similar or better asics. Jihan is very worried about this and he wants to kill off other mines right now, and get total domination. In his view, losing the edge is equal to losing every thing.
Jihan is not against SW or LN, he just want big blocks asap, but if LN came out and works, the need for big blocks will die out, this is the reason behind.

If miners wanted to avoid centralization we would be still mining with PCs. Miners always wanted power and domination.  
Bitmain want large blocks to kill other miners. If sw and LN is successful, it will kill the need for large blocks , hence they oppose sw.
If there is a solution of sw+big blocks, they will support it.

@_date: 2017-04-24 11:28:12
Why did Microsoft fight in court to give away ie for free? Were they stupid? You see, bitmain has an edge in asic making and their mining margin is much higher than others. It's in their interest to drive down the coin price to kill off competitors. A short term gain in profit won't mean much to them, it'd be a nightmare for them if it attracts more players into the game.
Secondly, the best way to understand BU is to study the technical spec yourself, rather than guessing other people's motives. Read the spec, think, you will know what a load it really is.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:46:03
Not large enough. And likely stop further effort to make larger blocks. I don't know nothing for certain, if you have a better guess than mine please share it.

They can go back to a block and restart from there, they can change the code to invalidate or negate whatever transaction they want in a hard fork. They can do anything.  Example: the UBTC fork of bitcoin has reclaimed all inactive coins including satoshi coins.

Its not about how to use a blockchain, its all about who manages the blockchain. A blockchain is not immutable if it's managed or owned by someone. Whoever owns it can change the history by forking, like what happened to ETH. So if your supplychain system runs on bitcoin blockchain then it is immutable, if it runs on some private chain then its totally pointless, you are much better off running a SQL database.

It seems you are bought into this "technically superior coin" propaganda. The cold fact is there is no  "technically superior coin", The best talents in industry work on bitcoin not any other alt coin. Most alt coins are outright scams. 
Example: ETH "Smart Contract" is absolutely useless, can you give any example on how this Smart Contract is used apart from hosting other ICO scams? These flashy terms are minted to fool people. 
Just remember: Technology is difficult to understand, but the Usefulness of a technology should be very clear. Just like we use google to search, amazon for online shopping, ipod for listening to music, bitcoin for money, etc. If you find a technology's usefulness is very difficult to explain, it's likely a scam.

1. There is no development on bitcoin project, which is a lie
2. I'm an idiot
3. There are use cases for smart contract, some corporation is going to use it, you didn't say what these use cases are, but I'm an idiot for not understanding them?
I'm not going to argue against a post with no substance like this.   
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:32:31
This is impossible. Price are driven by supply and demand. If supply is limited and demand goes infinite, the price also goes infinite. No institution has enough money to do so.
That why when states want to control all gold they outlaw and confiscates them, instead of buying them with the bill they can print infinitely.   
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:58:09
I think you are vastly underestimating the amount of money you need to pull this off. Bitcoin is so liquid and well known.
Think it this way: if you buy 10% of all bitcoins, Do you think the market cap of remaining 90% of bitcoins will be higher or lower than the market cap of 100% bitcoins before you made your move? it will be definitely higher right? 
So the more bitcoins you purchase, you will need to pay even more for the remaining part.
Again, even if you are an institute who can print money, you won't be able to purchase 50% of all existing Bitcoins before the value of whatever notes you print goes to Zero. For institutions who can't print money, this is just out of question.   
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:30:58
Bitcoin is portable and divisible, gold is not. They can run gold trade on paper because these inherent deficiencies of gold. Today bitcoin is still hard to store and use for dads and mums, just like the internet was hard to use, many people can not operate a personal wallet. But bitcoin will become much easier to use and general knowledge and awareness of bitcoin will raise.
There will be no market for "paper bitcoin" on a scale similar to gold.
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:50:38
This is a typical example of a technology whose usefulness being very difficult to explain and understand. why? because if it's simple, people won't be fooled.
Let me explain to you what an ICO is. There is really nothing new about ICO. If you print your "coin" on paper instead of issuing them digitally, it's called security, and it's illegal to issue security to public without SEC's approval. This has been a great inconvenience to scammers. With rise of Bitcoin, scammers found a way to issue illegal securities, by disguising them as digital currencies, so they can scam as many people as possible before authority comes in to ban them. 
The bottom line: There is no need to run smart contract code on a blockchain, it's costly, issue prone, and meaningless. You have a contract, you execute it on a trusted platform, like it has always been. There are maybe some use cases for blockchain based contract automation on settlement layer between banks, but that has nothing to do with the ETH blockchain out there.

I'm not saying that, it's difficult to estimate to need for anonymity, just saying illegal transactions are important application of anonymity.
Also police confiscating cash on street seems to believe anonymity is equal to illegal.

Hello，do you the door to "I sold btc at 3100 USD club"? Thx
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:50:13
that's why ethereum is such a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:45:29
Am I the only one who think this is dumb? Trading in bitcoin will only make sense if you exchange real bitcoin for goods and services. This is the whole purpose of bitcoin. If you deposits your bitcoins in some account and transferring them using a card, this is just banking. They can run such service on any currencies or commodities.

bitcoin is token of value，automobiles are consumables，they are totally different. if bitcoin can not hold value then no crypto can.

It depend on what "a block chain agrees" means. For crytos, any change is possible as long as the entire community agrees so. We can remove the bitcoin 21 mil cap and inflate it like fiats, IF the entire community agrees so.  If you want to make a change and the community is split then you have a fork.

The simplest example is probably escrow - a smart contract can implement and enforce that a third party holds funds in escrow for a first and second party, until either the third party approves release of funds, or a time window expires. The fact that this is implemented in-contract mean it's impossible for anything except an entire chain fork to invalidate it, if implemented without bugs. Here's some examples of Ethereum escrow contracts: 1 2, and an entire escrow platform: 3. This is the tip of the iceberg.

It's actually a common misunderstanding of what value is, many people are fooled by this concept of "intrinsic value".

An ICO is basically a marketing exercise. You want to run a profitable ICO in China, you need to run it from within China.

If Vitalik is smart, he would have quit the scam already. He has set himself up for this endless nightmare. Would he be pumping eth for his entire life?

I don't think so. if the idea of “value” is totally perceptive，then so is the idea of “bubble”. By definition，a bubble is the difference between price and value. if tulips were a bubble，then so is gold. 
As for bitcoin，just like everything else，its value depends on how many people believe it has value. Due to it's unique properties. The. Number of people who believe it's value will only increase.

Yep, then you need to measure how valuable Monero anonymity is.
Today,  Monero/Bitcoin is about 1:50 in market cap. So what's the proportion of Illegal transactions vs Legal transactions in fiat world today? You can think about this estimating Monero's long term value.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:17:03
Yes, there is. You can google for physical bitcoins. A physical bitcoin will display its address and seal its private key. To use physical bitcoin you need to trust the issuer not keeping your private for their own .

You should not，you are not buying huge alt bubbles.

And he fears losing it. Imagine Samsung/Cisco/huawei entering this market.
The way to prevent others from entering is to keep the coin price down.

Very much like it. A strong and healthy bitcoin will attract more hardware manufacturers into asic making, which may undermine their dominance. It's in their benefit to keep bitcoin somewhat crippled

A fractional reserve banking system on gold? Didn't we have this for a thousand years already? Nice try.

It's defined by bitcoin protocol that to raise the block size cap you need to do a hard fork, which splits bitcoin into two coins. This is why blocksize increase has always been so controversial.
Bitcoin Unlimited proposes to make blocksize limit a configurable value so that miners can do a hard fork anytime they feel like it, miners can then use block size to kill off competitors.
BU is either a stupid design by third rate engineers or a malicious attempt to take over bitcoins.
Does this answer your question?
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:57:07
Agreed. If we can reach a compromise, no UASF is needed.

It's good fun to troll other scam coins with Ripple. Ripple doesn't even pretend to be a decentralized crypto currency, demonstrates how stupid this alt coin frenzy is.

If Jihan doubles down, which is most likely, he will command his hash rate to attack the SW chain, rendering it unusable, this is the worst scenario.

Makes sense, this is the exit strategy for other assets too.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:26:20
No, I think they are softening their position with this statement.
Two month ago They were saying "we support BU not SW", One month ago they were saying "we will support SW only if it's a different SW and do a 2m hard fork at same time". Now they are saying "we will support SW if you can prove this SW patent accusation is false".
This almost sounds like they are just trying to save face now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:25:44
Good for you, but if you always try to time the market you run the risk of say bye to bitcoin. It only take one wrong guess to throw you off the train and you will be waiting for bitcoin go lower forever. I know some one still waiting for bitcoin to go below 300 as he sold at 400ish

This is so called trading, it's basically a gamble against other players, your chance of winning is usually low.

He is saying the soft fork will turn out to be a hard fork, not saying he is attempting to counter fork.
