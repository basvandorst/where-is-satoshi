Gyft.com, as a way to buy gift cards (Amazon, BestBuy, etc.) is really easy to use, and gift cards themselves are really flexible.

I liked the idea of a physical coin to give as a gift along with bitcoin, but when I went searching the other day, I didn't find any active sellers, just references to ones that are now out of stock.  Thanks for your suggestions, because now I will be getting some unloaded coins to fill and give as gifts!

Thank you!  I was just thinking about buying one, too.  I shall look into it more fully.

I think I've missed it, which are you referring to by "simplest storage solution," that apparently was disingenuous?

Thanks for breadwallet, and thank you for such a good clarification!

I'm getting a 404 on that link now, so hopefully that means it is already taken down (thanks to your help).
This reminds me, I've seen the Bither wallet on iOS, and it seems like a clever thing, where it has a cold wallet mode meant to be used on a separate device only in airplane mode, but I haven't seen Bither mentioned when people ask about good iOS wallets.  Is it legit?  Has anyone checked it out?  I haven't entrusted any coins to it yet.
