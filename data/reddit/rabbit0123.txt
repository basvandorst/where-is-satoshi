He means that if your brother encrypted his wallet , and private keys with it , without the Password you cannot access his crypto even you find the wallet.
You need private keys to access any crypto address on any coin. Usually even if people don’t encrypt the whole hard drive, they encrypt the wallet file.

Bitcoin can not just be a store of Value. With no payment capacity it will slowly lose its price appreciation once market finds another innovative « big thing ». To stay relevant it must be used for a variety of things by people.

Exactly. And this is a huge risk of Bitcoin vs like standard store of value like bonds or gold - those do not need and cannot evolve to still be a store of value ( extremely flawed as they are), they don’t have a competition in their fundamental aspects . You cannot make a more advanced version of gold for exemple, it is like t is and will be eternally. 
Bitcoin is a technology at the very core of it, and the technology HAS to move forward to stay relevant .
We have seen a lot of new iterations of techs that completely erased those who didn’t want to evolve from the market. I still remember how everyone had a feature phone before iPhone &amp; Android, now they are almost non-existent.
