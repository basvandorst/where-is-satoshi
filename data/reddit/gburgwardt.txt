It's not this mod team in particular (I dislike the current rules in their own, of course, but that's not my point), but that we might start banning discussion on the basis of FUD or trolling. Most of bitcoin's history is FUD, trolling, etc (see Bitcointalk as exhibit a) and we're more or less fine despite it, people aren't as dumb as you might think.
@_date: 2015-12-28 04:11:20
You're downvoted because you are making up nonsense and generally aggressively mocking people.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:25:18
Do you not realize the difference between a pool and miners? If users really didn't want larger blocks 
1. they wouldn't be asking for them everywhere
2. they could mine somewhere else, make their own pool, etc. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:25:05
But that's the thing, if they're basically playing devil's advocate isn't that helping Bitcoin? Am I trolling because I'm asking these questions? I'm not going to lie, I would not be surprised to be banned, and if I cared about that it would definitely have a chilling effect on my discussion here.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:08:05
Do you have any proof that there are bots? I've talked to a lot of people who all like bip101 and it feels like there's a large number of people who support it, can have discussions, etc. 
I don't doubt that there is vote manipulation but I don't believe at the moment that there is more vote manipulation for bip101 than anything else in particular.

I have to agree with deeb, no worrying about identity theft, cc info going missing, etc.
True the merchants don't see the cc info, but I imagine it's just a matter of time before paypal is hacked, or stripe or whoever. Too juicy of a target. 
Who's gonna steal my bitcoins? I trust myself to keep my computer secure, and so far, I have. Fraud can be avoided by dealing with reputable merchants, and/or by using escrow.

 ***Here is my commentary on these bulletpoints, but generally speaking I think the definition of entities dealing in virtual currency is too broad and should be split into two or more categories, with only exchanges seeing even some of these regulations. Of the actual regulations on the entities dealing with virtual currencies, I think most are too restrictive, though of the objectionable regulations, about half are legacy regulations faced by many industries, and half are stupid new ones specific to virtual currencies. Only one or two of the regulations really seems reasonable.***

What do you mean "what is being proposed"?
AFAIK the difference between encrypting a private key with n of m style encryption is that there is still a single private key that can be compromised to spend coins on the network, whereas with coins locked via m of n private keys, you have more private keys you'd need to find, so it is cryptographically more secure.
But I'm just a student with a basic knowledge of cryptography, so please someone tell me if I'm wrong.

There is value put in. Mining secures the network. When someone invests in mining equipment they're making the bitcoin network that much harder to 51% attack. That deserves compensation, don't you agree?

A few things.
1. Sponsors will not help with the venue, or give you cash. They don't want to deal with that nonsense, that's your job. They just want to advertise their products and have some of them given away.
2. Don't host a lan at a high school, it'll be bad. Look into renting a fire hall, usually they're fairly good.
3. Nothing is more important than power and network. Put all your effort into making sure you're solid there. I'd recommend a 20 amp circuit per 2 person table if you want to make sure you'll be fine. A proper electrical drop box is super helpful. We had a custom made job that dropped down a 240v line to a craptop of 120 circuits.
4. Email everyone, keep it short and to the point, but explain yourself. Aim for a paragraph about your lan, what you offer, what you expect to happen, and a sentence or two about what they can offer. **Personalize this for each company**. That said, you can make it easy for yourself by making it mostly a form letter, ie "we would love if you could donate &lt;product&gt;" and just swap out product and the name at the beginning of the letter. Bonus points for saying you're a longtime customer, regardless of whether that's true.

Standard Oil was actually unable to completely monopolize the market, and was losing market share right before it was broken up. Additionally, under Standard Oil, the price for oil dropped massively, and then rose after it was broken up. To say that they would have monopolized "20 different industries" is primarily foolish, but also to assume it would have been bad is a mistake.

A part of this at least would be triple entry accounting. 
Double entry accounting was big because it kept track of every purchase as a debit or a credit to an account, so it made "cooking the books" a lot harder. But still possible, because there was no proof of the transaction, except the entry in the books. 
Triple entry accounting with bitcoin allows an accountant to use the third entry as a link to a transaction on the blockchain, providing cryptographic proof that the transaction did in fact take place.

The short of it is that originally, satoshi worried about someone spam attacking bitcoin back when it was in its infancy, and thus bloat the blockchain for all eternity with arbitrary amounts of transactions that weren't behind actual growth. 
I can't list off the attack vectors it currently protects against because I don't have the time, since technically I'm procrastinating on other stuff to reply to all these comments. Ping me in about 7 hours and I'll do what I can though. Generally speaking I'll say that a block size increase that protects against whatever attacks we are aware of would be a good thing, though at this point 2mb is probably not worth the "risk" and core won't even compromise to that.
I don't think calling me a conspiritard and "technical illiterate" is productive, and if this sub is so well moderated I think comments like that should be removed, personally. I would be willing to bet that I've been involved in and discussing bitcoin longer than you have, though of course that doesn't necessarily mean I understand it better. Just, don't be rude, is my point.

This seems pretty reasonable, that's a ton of connections and a fairly low average rate. 
I personally don't think people aren't running full nodes because of bandwidth or storage (most of the time), but just that it's inconvenient even at 1mb blocks, as well as hard to set up, for minimal gain.
Especially since the best wallet (armory) stopped development.

I think the disagreement comes from the content removal re: "non consensus clients", I think that is in bad faith and scummy, personally, and apparently others agree.
To take BU as an example, it is a consensus client, and if there is consensus to change the block size, it will follow consensus, whereas core for example, would not (core client would follow the then minority chain, in the case of said hypothetical fork). 
I think the general attitude of many users here that rbtc is full of people who are "attacking" bitcoin is bad, but I can't necessarily blame you for that. I just don't understand the outright hostility to suggestions to improve bitcoin, even if you disagree.

I am not 100% sure it's everything, but I know there are changes to prevent script attacks on bitcoin, ie complex transactions that take significantly more time to verify than normal. This currently isn't much of a concern with 1MB blocks because of the way they scale (IIRC) but needed to be addressed with larger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:24:44
I'd also like to point out that you're talking about upload - you can run a listen only node on your connection for sure - not everyone in the middle of nowhere needs to relay blocks.

I'm going to ignore the part where you are overly paranoid. You may as well worry about your computer's hardware having backdoors for all the good it will do you.
I don't understand how you are unclear on how averages work. If 80+% of the population of the USA can handle larger blocks, then you **ARE** the exception, no matter how many times you insist you aren't.
And this is what people HAVE, I'm sure many people could upgrade if they needed to.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:25:48
Fairly certain that BU's defaults are to accept UP TO 16MB blocks, and to CREATE 1MB blocks (ie work with core client, until someone sees the signaling as conducive to a larger block)

Not according to the Bitcoin.org FAQ 
That's good but increasing the block size would be much easier and faster than coming up with a hack of a soft fork.

You're assuming that larger max block size would lead to immediately full 8mbyte blocks, which is unlikely to be true.

The hard fork per the agreement needed to be 2MB. Not a decrease.

I will for sure admit that I haven't tracked the mempool myself, but is that consistent filling of 24MB blocks, like we have now with 1MB - 
I would be surprised if so, and I agree that lower fees will likely lead to more transactions, but I am not convinced that even 16MB blocks would cause problems for most nodes, and at some point yes, there are minimum requirements for running a node.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:10:22

We could weight the types of transactions and sum them to find out what the average would be, but I'd be willing to bet it's below 1.8 - I see very little support for multi key signing.
Either way my point is that rather than redesign how transactions work in a crazy soft fork, we should kick the can to 2mb blocks, then hard fork seg wit and other improvements in. I don't understand the fear of hard forks and reverence for the 1mb block limit around here. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:28:28
Increasing the block size is not "giving up decentralization and most other founding principles of bitcoin"

That is a link to the agreement, but note that there was some sketchy stuff going on with some of the signatures being changed on the published version, so do some googling to make sure you read up on that if you're interested.
The tl;dr version is that some devs and some miners met and agreed to segwit AFTER a ~2MB base block size increase, and the only thing that came close was lukejr's laughable HF to reduce the max block size to ~300kB which would slowly grow to ~47MB IIRC in 2050.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:27:02
I would argue that limiting discussion to a megathread is censorship, but I guess that doesn't really matter in as much as that is a shitty thing to do, IMO. That's why I prefer anyway.
Besides, "non-consensus code" only triggered if there was a 75% consensus IIRC. No way for people to accidentally fork, that's just FUD
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:03:49
SPV wallets work fine if you spend say, $5 a month to host a VPS dedicated to your electrum node, for example. Or even a remote bitcoind for that matter.
And if you can find a better source, please tell me, but I didn't find one immediately.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:11:22
As I understood it, was removing mention of non-blockstream/core code that proposed to increase the max block size rather than wait for convoluted proposals like segwit to come online (in a bad way, since it's a soft fork instead of a hard fork).
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:34:18
Would the requirements even really be CPU/storage bound? CPUs are pretty fast and cheap, as is storage. The big problem is bandwidth, which is what I was referring to, isn't it? At some point, we have to draw the line for a middle ground between a usable system (ie blocks large enough) and keeping it accessible (blocks not too large). I'm not convinced that a centrally planned 1MB number is the way to go here.
Re: full nodes, you've certainly got more experience if you're actually the guy who made armory (great software by the way, thank you), but I think my point above re: CPU/storage stands.

Apologies, I knew that at one point but was confused by your name. Still, thank you for the work.
RAM I remember reading about, my understanding is that it's not a significant limitation - a quick google shows that raspis can *run* a full node just fine, but the initial syncing fails after it gets to around block 300000 ( which means that 1gb is not enough. Does the RAM usage scale linearly? What's ram usage like when running (after syncing)? My guess is that 8GB of RAM would be enough to sync the blockchain and less than 1GB is needed to do day to day verification/etc.
Of course this is all guessing. I imagine there is data out there but honestly I'm worried about politicization skewing the numbers one way or another.
Do you have any idea what sort of time difference it would be if you only loaded a portion of the chain into RAM or none at all, and just read off of an SSD? How long is too long for an initial sync?
I don't really expect you to have answers for most of these, I'm just thinking out loud.
I think your idea for a block size/fee sum/difficulty algorithm is interesting, but I'm not the guy to implement something like that, but if you write up a convincing whitepaper I'd be all over that. 
I agree re: magic numbers, though I do think that EC is somewhat better - in other words, if all development were to stop today, I'd rather have EC than the status quo.
Lastly, thank you for a reasonable discussion, they seem rare today.

The target hash is a really big number. When miners are hashing, they are plugging in info about the transactions they are confirming into a function that outputs a random number. If that number is below the target, they've found a block.
Hopefully that helps, but ask more questions if it doesn't, I'll do my best

Well it's just risk vs reward, for large amounts you want at least one confirmation, for smaller amounts just listening for a double spend should work fine.

@_date: 2012-11-29 17:53:20
Excuse me? It's been well known for quite a while that for small amounts it's easy enough to detect most double spends simply by being close to the center of the web of bitcoin nodes. Anyone trying to double spend will send out two conflicting transactions within milliseconds of each other, and your node would see both, and thus sound the alarm of an attempted double spend.
@_date: 2012-09-24 00:13:15

Alright, that's what I was asking. The blockchain is an option, ideally though you'd want the servers to try and trade locally first. If trust is an issue, that does slow down the confirmation time, but double spends are still very difficult to pull off without being noticed.

More blocks == more headers in the same amount of time, thus more disk space used.
And it doesn't change the security of verification over a given amount of time. The same amount of work is done (assuming the networks have the same amount of power) per unit of time. We may as well change each block in bitcoin to be 3 verifications by your logic.

Okay okay, lets step back. You wanted to use bitcoin in an mmo, yes? So all transactions are within this mmo.

A full node needs to be open to receiving incoming connections - you have to open a port in your router/firewall to get more than 7 connections, which increases the strength of the network.
Though sometimes "full node" is used to refer to just a full client, which has all tx history, but isn't accepting incoming connections.
Your understanding of confirmations is correct, though keep in mind one confirmation isn't perfectly secure. If there is a race with two different blocks found at the same time, some transactions can unconfirm if the chain that ends up winning hasn't included those transactions.
Keep in mind this is largely academic and fairly rare, and 2+ confirmations is *very* secure, I don't know if there've been more than a handful of 2+ chain reorganizations in bitcoin's history.
Bitcoin Core 
1. Verifies blocks that it gets from other network members, then if accepted, transmits it to other network members who request it.
2. Receives, verifies, and transmits unconfirmed transactions
among many other things.

@_date: 2015-04-20 19:13:47
Lets try a different analogy.
An economy has 1000g of gold. Assume it is roughly evenly distributed in an economy that is static in size and # of participants.
That works fine and people use the gold as both a store of value and a transaction method. But suddenly there is a large influx of people, so the gold is spread more thinly. People transact with 10^-10th the amount they were using before, and specialized equipment is used to carry and transact such small amounts of gold.
Now, if gold wasn't "limited supply" someone could come and bring more gold into the system, potentially at will. But while the economy can keep functioning, the only new value comes from a growing economy, rather than a bank or miner adding more gold to the system.
Let me know if that helps, I sometimes get too excited about analogies and they end up only making sense to me.

Why do people go hungry? We can just take a big sandwich, and cut it into smaller and smaller pieces and everyone has as much as they can eat!
Bit snarky, sorry, but it's the analogy I like.
As granularity increases, that doesn't increase supply, just like cutting a sandwich thinner doesn't make more food. It just allows you to distribute the sandwich in smaller pieces.

I honestly haven't been following this that closely, so I think there's probably a lot of trouble over what is ultimately a small change.
An idea that occurred to me though- how about just having a check box in the options in core to let you either drop RBF txs, or send them onward? Why does it have to be hardcoded one way or another?
@_date: 2016-10-16 02:00:35
"We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.
This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community."

@_date: 2015-11-10 14:07:48
Alright, I could be wrong, but my understanding is that with a permanent fork,  coins that exist before the fork can be spent on either chain, and if you spend on the original chain, the fork chain won't see the TX and thus still credit the original address with fork coins.
In the original example there's no way to have spent both fork and non-fork coins at the same time (at least with standard clients) as you suggest in your op.
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:08:04
I would appreciate that as an option on the site, though to be honest I will likely just be running XT .12 which presumably won't accept the RBF change anyway.
Why is RBF going to be the default? Shouldn't it be an optional version?
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:31:26
Can we still use non-core bitcoinds with this? Classic, BU, etc? How would that interact with segwit support? I'm pretty sure without segwit support in the bitcoind you're using that armory would just be unable to interact with segwit txs, I'm just curious.

@_date: 2015-11-28 23:36:45
My thought is that a checkbox is friendlier to people making their own decision, rather than a sudden change to a fairly important part of the core client, and an ideal rollout would be to first implement the option in settings, then change the default setting for new installs if it ends up working well/people want it.
Personally on RBF I think that it has it's uses but zero conf tx's are used all over the place, with a moderate degree of safety given most people don't RBF right now. I think that changing that behavior suddenly is unsafe and inconvenient for a lot of people.
I think it would be far less controversial if people weren't using zero conf tx's right now, and had more warning to upgrade their systems, though I'm not sure how it would work to be honest.
Either way thanks for talking with me about this, you're at least polite and well spoken. I wish we had more people like that and less "omg I hate peter todd and you should too" and "fuck off XT shills" etc etc. More ideas, less anger.

EC has been consistently above 40% for quite some time - 
Not sure why you don't think that counts, except to try and massage the facts into sounding good for your side in the argument.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:43:31
Just because it is likely doesn't make it a good idea. A centrally controlled Bitcoin is much worse than a decentralized Bitcoin.

Thank you very much for the response. Always been a big fan of Armory.

Source on that?
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:32:18
Yes, and I would bet money I was interested in bitcoin way before you.
Just because I agree with the ideals of bitcoin doesn't mean everyone does, and I think it's beneficial to realize that. You come off like a crazy person and that in the end is far more damaging to bitcoin than an ETF. There's a reason people mock our subreddit.
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:29:53
I have to second this, that's ridiculous, you should switch banks.

Get on my level - ~900 coins at .73 for a laptop.
I'm just gonna take credit for single handedly building the bitcoin economy so I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

The seller and buyer could complete a 2 of 3 multi signature transaction even if the admin of the site disappears or is hostile

I don't disagree, but this is orthogonal to my comment

The UK is positive? Then why is it so damn hard for coinbase or bitpay to have reasonable merchant services there.
I've tried to pay people there multiple times and there's just no good way for a small seller to convert bitcoin to GBP
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:27:33

@_date: 2015-02-15 01:46:03
internal bitcoin transfers don't require bitcoin at all. That's just another paypal with centralized trust.

If you're looking for alternatives, I can't say enough nice things about ally bank. All online, but really, why would you want to have to go to the bank ever?
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:31:59
Man the FUD is really ramping up lately. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:32:53
So because they don't want to use bitcoin at a core level, they shouldn't be allowed to invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:14:54
So that proves you filled out that ticket at that particular time. Does that stop someone from erasing your stuff and putting in their own?
Not trying to be difficult, but I don't think that this proves what you think it does.

Transferring between currencies and countries adds fees, up to 6.5% iirc

That wasn't the problem. Segwit never got 50%+ even if the hashpower. People just didn't like it.

No begging please
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:36:59
I think there are use cases for this, but address reuse concerns me. Do you think your system could work with stealth addresses?
Note that that might be impossible, since I don't think I understand very much about how your system works.
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:43:26
How does that prove that you are the sole owner?
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:24:11
You do realize Bitcoin is based on proof of work for a reason, right?

Seriously, this is ridiculous, and it seems like each side is getting worse and worse as the people trying to get everyone to talk reasonably and assume good faith leave, so only the extremists are left on both sides.
Fucking ridiculous, christ.
For the record, I think EC is a pretty cool idea and would work well, but it is a new idea that deserves testing.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:15:59
I don't know about years - if we hockey stick, I think we'll be facing problems much sooner than later. But with one hard fork under our belts and some actual data, we can probably get somewhere without another 4 years of bullshit and mudslinging.
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:31:30
Alright, then that makes me feel better. Definitely a good idea when they are interested!
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:07:19
That's how people tend to win arguments on this these days. So many times I've seen back and forth that small blockers just drag out forever rather than concede the smallest of points.
@_date: 2013-03-14 02:24:48
Looking at the two, the rise in value nowadays is far more stable than in 2011.
I wouldn't really take anything from this (predicting the future is hard), but thank you for posting.
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:27:03
I'm already paying ~5x normal tx fees, because blocks are full. No thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:00:45
For the longest time messages in support of block size increases were  removed, and generally debate was suppressed. Frustrating.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:18:38
You might also want to check out ally, they sound similar.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:10:37
This is bad advice, since he'd have to trust blockchain.info. Better to use bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:14:44
Sounds like a really good idea. Because for consumers, bitcoins don't provide a whole lot - it's the merchants that it's great for, so the reduced risk of chargeback and low tx fees should be passed on to incentivize its use.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:46:29
What happened? Link?

Can we just not have these shitty, stupid memes instead? These are so awkward it's painful.

Yeah, I like to feel I helped the fledgling bitcoin economy way back when. It's just a bit sad knowing how much that's worth :P
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:03:00
Boy I sure am glad satoshi lucked into the right constant for bitcoin to work! That would have been embarrassing if he picked .5MB or 2MB.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:59:22
No, it's way harder to get bitcoins now - GPUs are effectively shut out by the introduction of ASICS.
@_date: 2013-01-02 20:30:55
Sounds reasonable, what with the new year. Unexpected things happen around new years, no need for panic yet.

The Atopia Chronicles (damn good book) specifically mentions bitcoin, but it's not a major part of the book.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:49:33
The limit was put in place to prevent someone spamming the blockchain before we knew what to do about it. Satoshi's white paper doesn't advocate for a block size limit
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:16:49
I like ally - they've had a sketchy past but their service is top notch and they never have caused me any problems whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-01-22 18:00:50
At 2400 merchants, that's only about 4 transactions per merchant. Something we'll have to work on if we want more adoption of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:48:35
I spent 800 coins on a laptop way back when they were worth less than a buck each. You know nothing 
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:37:10
Trying way too hard, it's quite the stretch to compare any potential "pay wall" we have nowadays to the berlin wall. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:35:13
Do you even know what that means? I don't believe they publish their source, so I wouldn't trust them with more than a few hundred dollars. QT is much more trustworthy

I think his method is best for now, but I really don't feel like arguing, sorry. I don't think your concerns are founded.

They are awful at timetables, but I don't think it's vaporware. We've all seen all the images that one dev took when he went there, they have everything they need to assemble ASICS and they have previously put out a solid product. To call them vaporware is a bit of a stretch.
Of course, I might eat my words in a bit, but as it stands I don't think there's much of an argument over whether they are actually making the ASICs, just a lot of people upset about the fact that they suck at timing.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:19:24
Unconfirmed txs are fairly safe. It's very difficult to double spend unless you're set up for it, and even then whichever TX is sent out first will almost certainly be confirmed. I generally accept unconfirmed transactions up to ~1 btc. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 08:00:38
I'm not going to argue it could have been a bait and switch, but we've seen the inside of their labs and they have, at the very least, got everything they'd need to assemble the asics they claim to be assembling. Maybe it is a scam, but at this point it's far more likely that they are just awful at planning.
Note that I wouldn't advise anyone to order from BFL until the current orders ship, you're in a huge queue anyway and it is risky.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:48:13
Seriously? I've never heard of credit that bad.
Have you tried Ally? They're fairly neutral on the bitcoin thing and so far I've never had problems with them.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:34:03
Obviously they'd be more expensive, probably could deal with the smaller ones but if you can get the 100w ones I'd be all over that.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:36:18
mind sharing your business name or what you sell?
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:26:59
But if the package is lost or intercepted, he loses a few hundred worth of silver, rather than thousands of btc
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:07:22
I'd be interested especially if you can get the bigger (100w) replacement bulbs, and family would probably be as well!
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:04:40
There used to be a guy running a grocery store where he'd mail you groceries for bitcoin, that was pretty awesome. May or may not be viable though
@_date: 2013-01-23 01:03:58
It was invented for a bunch of reasons, but payment processing software or firms will be needed for wider adoptions. Bitpay is fantastic, there's just not a lot of volume, so that's something we should work on.
@_date: 2013-02-27 03:27:22
This seems pretty mean if they aren't interested in bitcoins. Probably 50/50 to actually get them interested v pissing them off.
@_date: 2013-03-21 11:30:05
In addition to the fact that it's just an awful meme. People really should just stop
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:13:01
This is false, at least since early november when I ordered coins. I had to confirm I picked up the package of coins, then he batch funded all the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:41:43
Any link you can find for that? I would love to be able to send money to mexico easily!

I take it you tip the driver with cash or what have you? That's mildly annoying, but not awful. Quite the progress we've made in the past few years!
@_date: 2013-08-31 06:10:13
Backed for $25. The team has put out a good initial public video, and I like the idea that they are putting forward of a TV network that produces deeper content that can look at something in depth. We'll see how this turns out but I'm definitely willing to gamble 25 dollars.

I'd get paid in bitcoin, if anyone is looking for an EE intern!
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:52:27
My two thoughts: Firstbits, or a website to go to get the invoice (one you run, or someone else runs as a service). 
Example of the latter:
"I also accept bitcoin! To pay via BTC, visit  digit invoice  to find your payment address"
It's computationally cheap enough to just generate an address for every invoice and the invoice # would ideally be randomized in order to prevent seeing who else owes you what.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:58:56
