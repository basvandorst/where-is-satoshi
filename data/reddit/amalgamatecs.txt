I like bittrex, it seems the most consistent and stable. There mixed feelings about them in the crypto community but I haven't had any issues. also I try not to keep alot in there.

move to an exchange. You can trade into another currency temporarily(some random shitcoin) while btc normalized then trade back (assuming the shitcoin is liquid)

Do you currently earn the same wage as a worker in 1919?

Bitconnect only

But it's not pinned to gold so it has all the same issues that Fiat has.

Reminds me of people who say "ATM Machine"

I found "BuyHighSellLow" in there
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:22:20
By your logic.... Go all in on bitconnect..... 1 bitconnect == 1 bitconnect

Coinbase is garbage. I bought at 7300 and then right around the time the transaction was going to settle(10 days after original draft) Bitcoin shot way up and coinbase gave me some BS error saying that I put a stop payment on the draft so they couldnt complete.... I contacted my bank and they said coinbase never even tried to draft money.

Shows someone complaining about transaction fees....... proposes Bitcoin as a solution. Yikes

"you don't have to innovate to win" while also saying that fiat and gold is outdated and Bitcoin is the answer because it's innovating

1 bitconnect = 1 bitconnect

Gemini is trash. They wouldn't validate my identity and also told me they couldn't tell me why.

Literally every other post on here is a GIF of a rollercoaster..... definitely stability and security with bitcoin

I remember looking at investing in 2012 when it was like $2 and everyone was talking about what a bad decision that would be. To be fair it seemed like a bad investment at the time

Who cares.

Yes, what kills me more is when people say stuff like "HODL bro, remember 1 BTC = 1 BTC" based on their logic... "1 Blockbuster share = 1 Blockbuster share, hodl bro VHS is making a comeback"

Theres 15k beanie babies selling on eBay right now. The hype died but beanie babies are still going strong.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:36:22
While I think all the hodl and lbo talk is BS. I wish I would have bought the big players after the dot com burst. Most would have went to zero but the ones that went up skyrocketed(amazon/Google/PayPal/eBay)
