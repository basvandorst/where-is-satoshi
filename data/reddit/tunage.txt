Unlike gox that contracted nerds to build his site, Cryptsy was started by a nerd.
It's a long shot but I think they'll pull through. If I'm right, a minimal gamble could pay off big.

@_date: 2016-01-13 05:53:02
possibly. but a big part of me says that its to high tech for general public. way to many hacks. Not from the technology, but from foolish things end users do.
People using coins todays have 'some skills'.
A live posting method might work. Like an FB status that can be 24/7 monitored and community policed real time. If it got hacked, everybody would know and it could be addressed.
But regular folks would mess up the private key management somehow.
Just my 2 cents.

@_date: 2016-01-13 07:12:29
the act of hashing the vote for authenticity is surely a beneficial feature and now pretty standard. But computers already do much of this encryption already, i.e. SSL, but Bitcoin uses elliptical curve   just different math. The concept of community maintained forums (fucktons of eyeballs watching) I think would be good method to consider. Then implement authenticity verification via some efficient encryption method.
Satoshi used what was best that day. Computer algorithms have changed a pretty good bit since then. Nerds have been busy.

If you are so careless as to actually save your BTC on an online wallet, make SURE they are FDIC insured at a minimal (coinbase is one) and make sure you apply ALL securities to stored coins (i.e. 3 factor auth and use the vault)
The CORRECT way to store your coins is to buy yourself a low end Linux based tablet (Android is fine) and load a Bitcoin wallet directly on to it. Do NOT check your email on it, Do NOT surf Facebook with it, you don't use that computer for ANYTHING but coinz.
You keep it up to date religiously and only spend coinz with it and NEVER fire it up on an unknown/public network.
Then, make a mirrored copy of the drive and slap it in a safe deposit box.
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:21:42
I don’t understand the Bitcoin Core developers:
Bitcoin is a decentralized banking system. It has no physical address for the FBI to raid.
Without distributing the blockchain to 'all users' (the transaction history/security main brain), you would have to centralize the authentication somewhere, giving it a centralized location/physical address for the FBI to raid.
As it stands now, the ONLY way to shut down bitcoin is to shut down the Internet, which is designed to withstand a nuclear war.
I don’t understand the large bitcoin mining pools:
Mining was set up to run like a game, to encourage hashing. 98% of all hashes are counted and then disregarded to the trash.
The more you hash, the greater your chances are at finding a new block.
This was set up in the original design and worked. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Changing it would involve a complete redesign of the coin structure.
Bitcoin has already hard forked once and another big one in coming soon. The devs have no issues with forking the chain, its just a big deal and you have to plan it correctly.
no clue on the 3rd party questions.....

by cutting the payout in half, you are DOUBLING the network difficulty by default!!
you have to hit that network twice as hard to achieve the same payout.
make no mistakes about it, mining will become twice (2) as difficult.
That was very correct in my statement.

@_date: 2016-06-06 10:35:55
 its not a split.
the number of total coinz and/or the ability to get those coins (network hashing difficult) drives coin prices first!  second is technology news. last is market news (the wall street way)
42coin reached $120,000.00 for 1, for a reason.
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:53:50
The best time to implement changes is at a fork.
I was just surprised to see so many 'higher up folk' getting so pissy about the fork.
The only coinz that have not forked at this point, are dead.
At some point you have had to implement a security update that forces all users to download a new wallet version, or you have fucktons of security holes.
The Bitcoin Devs are on the ball.
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:49:34
Technically a fork is when you are referring to forking the blockchain. A new path. a fork in the road.
Dev basically locks all historical purchases and sets the software to build a 'new' blockchain with a public hash guaranteeing the fork.
But ALL users MUST download the new wallet version, so that their new purchases will appear on the new fork/path and not the old blockchain.
The blockchain is just historical data. As long as the network can validate it, basically a fork means nothing.
Early coins did forks to implement new features such as DRK (now DASH), when they implemented their new security controls (Their darksend aka one click money laundering) , they had to fork their blockchain and the price tripled. 
But then something went wrong in the implementation and the price tanked.  o.0
DRK eventually got their security protocol implemented and the coin did excellent, till they got dropped from a bunch of exchanges.
Other coins have already gone through the growing pains of forking and the process is very straight forward now.  DRK was trying to pull a huge trick also.
Bitcoin has massive Dev resources compared to DRK (Evan was one person on DRK)
But, as I stated before, Bitcoin has forked before, it was just under the title of a security update.
The biggest thing about coinz is, technology implementations effect the price a fuckton.  Not just market news.
An exchange getting hacked is bad, and will drive down the price.
Technology implementations can send the price to the moon, if done properly.

The pool has zero to do with the transaction. Nothing unless they get a block.
If that pool gets no blocks?  That pool has zero participation in the network other than a record that they tried.
Zip/zero/ziltch without a block.
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:00:55
its all statistics.
if you were going to try and compete for those 20 (soon to be 10 btc) with a pencil and paper?
You would have to be able to pencil out 1,000,000,000,000,000 algebra problems per second.
Miners use very specialized computers (ASIC application specific integrated circuit)  for the opportunity to 'compete for the chance' at winning the 20 btc (soon to be 10).
or, you could join a pool with your PC and receive a fraction of the pool payout (a pool is a fuckton of miners working together as a team for the chance to win a block/20 btc, soon to be 10).  The payout is tiny with a PC, like 0.00000001 btc for 2 weeks of churning hashes.  It is all based on the amount of work you put into the system.

My best professional guess (I know bank networks really well) is that you would need a Fiserv account to do anything like that.
That's a few million and a trip to congress.
All the financial institutions today piggy back on networks that block that feature.

you're very incorrect brother. Miners will be doubling up as fast as they can.
Though the need will be offset via the price increase.
But none the less, a miner will have to work twice as hard for the same btc payout.

@_date: 2016-06-06 09:52:17
forget the word split. is has nothing to do with the situation at all.
the miner churn hashes for the opportunity to get 40 btc. Like a game show on TV, but for computer chips.
Right now, if you WIN, the miner gets 40 btc (plus miner fees)
That number will change to 20 btc (plus fees)
In other words, the miners are going to have to work a fuckton harder to get 40 btc.  They will have to win twice.
Twice as difficult to get?  twice the price....  or a fuckton more.

If I understand your question correctly;
No, Bitcoin will not automatically give you free Bitcoins because a subscriber forgot to send. A human 'must' click send. Assuming a typical transaction.
Do any exchanges have an account that you can populate with BTC and then automatically withdraw from? Yes, but I don't think this is what you are asking about. The funds have to be initially placed into an account.
In a nutshell, Bitcoin it's self cannot force insurance companies to pay the Dr. No more than USD
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:42:55
What's the con?
They send you the money. Then you check your account and money is there. Then you release the coins.
