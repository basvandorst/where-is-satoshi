Alsomahler, you would only pay capital gains tax when you eventually convert btc to euros. Please see what I described about chapter 2.1. 
There's no wealth tax in Finland.

That's a good point to emphasize. The pass code should be 6+ random words at the minimum.

The highlights are:
Chapter 2.1 defines that profits gained from buying and selling Bitcoins are capital gains, and taxed as such (so 30% tax, and after 50k€ it's 32%). On the other hand, if you see a loss, it's not eligible for deduction of tax.
Chapter 2.1.2 defines how purchase of goods and services with Bitcoin are taxed. Example 2 describes how if you bough 2000 btc with 1000€, so @ 0.5€ (!!), and then buy goods with 1000 btc when btc/eur is 10€, your taxable capital gains are 9500€.
Chapter 2.1.4. defines that mining profits are seens as earned income, and taxed in euros with BTC/EUR rate of the day when you received the coins (e.g. mining pool sent them to your address)
Chapter 2.2 defines how businesses who receive bitcoins are taxed. In short they should convert the btc value to euros with the conversion rate of the day when they received the payment.
So to answer is this good or bad news, it's bad in the sense that Tax Administration is up to date on what virtual currencies are, has defined how they are be taxed, and if you ignore that you're evading taxes. 
I wouldn't be surprised if in the future Bitstamp would be asked to hand over details of European users, so countries can ensure people have paid taxes. Much like recently has happened with Swiss banks.

True. I would gladly pay taxes if I would have bought 2000 btc @ 0.5€.

In order not to realize capital gains means you never convert BTCs to euros. If you do, you as the one receiving the profits would have to pay the taxes. I think the concept is fairly simple if you don't think about bitcoin transactions but rather transactions between Mt.Gox/Bitstamp and your bank.

Have you seen [this]( You should test how many bits of entropy you'll get with 6 words.

Not sure I understand who would buy these, but the concept is interesting. From their web [site](
*Product Description:*

There's a distinction between a person daytrading and a business that accepts payment for goods and services in Bitcoin. The latter is what chapter 2.2. discusses. 
With corporations Bitcoins are seen as financial or liquid assets. Possible profits from selling Bitcoins received by selling goods or services are taxed as normal business profits. If a business sells these coins at a loss, it's tax-deductable.
If a person sells Bitcoins at a loss that's not eligible for tax deduction, as described in chapter 2.1.

What is very unsafe? You might want to elaborate when making a statement like that.

Looking at the Genesis Block's mining [calculator]( it's hard to believe that a purchase of ASIC now could ever bring a healthy profit. With many models the calculator says that already break-even within a year requires BTC price to rise considerably.
What do you think? Are you still buying them?

Ask that on and you will get an overwhelming "yes!" as the answer.

For creating a "savings account" address, you can also have a look at [Brainwallet]( It's an open-source client-side Bitcoin address generator. 
Just download the files to your PC, open index.html on your browser and you can create a new wallet, which password you can memorize and write to a paper (both analog data storages).

The article does discuss Bitcoin directly. Therefore I felt it's relevant to post here.
