News articles say Bitcoins.com is expected by an auctioning site to sell for $750,000.  I think they are crazy, I'm sure some people think my price is crazy.
BitcoinWallet.com domain was sold for $250,000

The history we are fed in school is not the full picture, nor did they mention our founding fathers where involved in underground markets and started there own currency.  Fact or Fiction about the video above can be aruged til end of time; I see bitcoin and all cryptocurrency as a opportunity to end world corruption and control enslaved by debt.

dig it, suggest 0.001 BTC per ticket who cares about USD value.
building trust is key, keep it simple
