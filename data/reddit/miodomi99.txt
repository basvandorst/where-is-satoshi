I'll try that out


yes, but it's an Electrum running on a server. how?

I'll try that.


Is there any way to do that in the test mode, with no real bitcoins? I mean, at the moment I have no bitcoins. Do I neccesarily have to buy one to be able to do testing?

also, what do you mean exactly by "when an adress is used"? if there's been a payment sent to that address it becomes used?
what if 100 customers come to my website at the same time and apply for a paid service, how would Electrum solve that? Meaning, it'd have to give them 100 bitcoin addresses at the same time. but there're only 15 or 20 ones available which Electrum generates at a time.

not yet, there's been a commit in Electrum, but it's not been included in the master yet.
suppose, a hacker broke into my server and replaced my wallet with his one by creating it the same as I did: from xpub. How would I know about that? Not necessarily right away, but for example, 3 hours later when I login into my server.

as far as I know, there's the gap parameter and its limit is 20 addresses. it's what the faq says. new addresses can be generated by creating a new wallet.
