It will go on a run soon I would imagine, possibly after chinese new year? I think its best to invest in altcoins atm and jump on when it starts to raise

Can be coded but you will need to go through an exchange using an API key. This idea is essentially just automating a manual proccess, would be useful from a personal point of view but I wouldn't expect very many people to download it

Yes it is a very solid investment as the market generally follows bitcoin, the reason i suggest altcoins is because the amount he is investing is relatively low so for a good return on investment i would look towards cryptocurrencies with a lower market cap. The technology is constantly evolving much of the more recent coins offer a lot more in my opinion and in the long term it will be the crypto with the best technology that prevails.

Less than 1.8% of the total energy production for the planet I would suspect? Not the point anyway I believe in cryptocurrency just dont see bitcoin as being the future

Yes completely unsustainable, will be overtaken by a much more sophisticated cryptocurrency. It was the first and youve got to respect that but bitcoin is certainly not one for the future.

Theres different platforms that allow the use of smart contracts and Dapp integration - etherium is one but the ones I find interesting are NEO, EOS, ADA. Theres also a few smaller projects I find interesting such as Oyster Pearl which is looking at decentralised storage and the removal of traditional advertising by incorporating a small code into a website, you provide a small amount of cpu processing to  provide the decentralised storage and the website owner gets payed in oyster thus removing the incentive for advertisements. The mainet is to be released at the end of this month as well so it's definitely something to keep your eye on

Yes a good idea in my opinion just make sure you aren't reliant on your investment, also i think that there are much better altcoins to invest in so if you have the time maybe look at the alternatives

Pound sterling also being pumped, clearly some whales manipulating the market

Dont pay for it then? Dont understand why you would want 'professional advice' when they have the same resources as yourself
