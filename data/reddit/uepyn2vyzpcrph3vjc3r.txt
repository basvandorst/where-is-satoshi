What's the math there?  It seems more like US$6 to $7 per transaction, looking at it that simply.

I feel a thundering sense of irony whenever I hear that quote.  It seems intended to be part of a discussion about people.

As strident as he is now in promoting BCH —- that’s what he used to do for Bitcoin.

I have enough self-confidence not to mind, and enough of everything else not to lose her.  If Roger brought a friendly lady we would have all had a good time.

Anarchapulco that year had a few hundred attendees, a few dozen good speakers, just a few really really great speakers.  Roger was one of those.  Very intense, passionate, focused, and he really seemed to believe that we were changing the world.
His primary focus was on bitcoin breaking the monopoly banks and government have over money and transactions.  "HODL and get rich" was NOT on the agenda.  We chatted with him for a while and he was just a great guy.  My wife was very attracted to him, that doesn't happen much with her.  She goes for the intelligent intense counterculture guy on a mission.

That is the most beautiful story about money I’ve read in a while.
