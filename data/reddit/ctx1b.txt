Oh so after looking at your link the guy explained it such that all the low transaction fees would get deleted anyways and be unable to slow down transaction of the blockchain?
Even if that is the case, it doesnt mean those massive amounts of tiny transactions **werent** sent without the intention of at least *trying* to slow down all btc transactions, right?

Your premise is incorrect, you are presenting a false dichotomy especially since the word "shitcoin" isnt easily defined and seems to change from person to person.

So he sent 250k btc and ended up selling 25k bitcoin at a loss??
Would somebody kindly take the time to explain the motives and economics behind Ver's move?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:31:09
Great graph! 
Just wondering if there's a way to check the price of the transactions when it was spiking (in other words the storm of $0.01 transactions) because the naysayers will just claim it was legitimate amounts of btc simply being transferred just at a much higher rate because o FOMO

its just that it was a drunken night full of adrenaline and profit taking so I wasnt exactly paying the most attention in the moment
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:56:41
thats exactly why Im here XD
Anyways do you know of any source I can pull that shows that chinese exchanges switched the pairing from btc to bch?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:34:22
huh? Whats with all this SJW identity politics nonsense, I thought bitcoin was one of few legitimate places libertarians have left

So was Ver the one that was essentially responsible for the price o fbitcoin to crash from $6200 to $5500?
(Which at the point short after the buy orders came pouring in and bounced the price right back up to $6000)
and would you say he succeeded or lost more money overall in the end?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:44:27
not to be an ass but thats *not technically over 9000*
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:01:46
why wouldnt it be good for price? Its not like when you send amazon the bitcoin for the product that amazon just makes the coin dissappear? In fact if they were to somehow make the bitcoin dissappear it would only serve to raise in the value of the rest of coins in circulation??
genuinely interested in learning

smug? Nah Im not Pepe
Just trying to pass on some information as I used to be that newbie who used to only use shapeshift and didnt know I was getting shafted by the transaction fees
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:19:51
You are supporting a shady CEO by using Shapeshift, not getting the bet prices, AND paying exorbitant transfer fees....
and only normies use it
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:07:13
dont be lazy, just use an actual exchange
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:59:19
This is all Greek to me...
While I do hope at some point to be able to comprehend all this lingo, could someone tell me whether or not it seems like a good or bad idea to invest right now before August 1st, or to wait until August 1st and wait to see if the prices go down???
thanks for any feedback
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:27:01
tell me what one bitcoin is worth now?
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:11:14
Sooo basically in your opinion it would be better to invest in BTC right now then wait and see unitl August 1st if the price drops?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:38:58
Technically speaking yes, he only paid 70 cents for it back then and so the net amount he lost was just 70 cents
But being just a little pragmatic about it the opportunity cost of the cat eating that 70 cent paper was $2600
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:02:52
Your cat ate a hefty $2600 piece of paper...
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:36:48
Perhaps it did, but we are talking pragmatically about the current moment, which is worth around $2600
just admit it, it sucks that your cat ate that paper, no shame in saying it...
