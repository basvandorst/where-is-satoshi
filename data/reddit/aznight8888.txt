I got a email saying they werent able to process my withdrawal even though my bank account is linked... 
"To resolve this issue, please take the following steps:

Team Circle
Ill contact them tomorrow, and i will only apologize when i get my money back.
ALSO i asked not to cash out but to transfer back my bitcoins but they said this was the only method........
I'm positive they will give me my money back because i also have the most recent conversation on recording! LOL

CIRCLE.COM IS NOT STEALING BITCOINS, IF THEY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT JUST CALL THEM TO RETRIEVE YOUR COINS/MONEY!!!
I AM SO SO SORRY!!

Why would i even need to wait for a reponse? they closed my account with my bitcoins still inside of it. 7 bitcoins which is about $5,000.
Thats a HUGE mistake if they did make one.....

When i logged in it said it was closed both times, they are leaving it up until i receive my funds.
You honestly don't have a point, closing someones account with a large sum of bitcoins in it will freak ANYONE out. Thats VERY unprofessional in my opinion.
I know coinbase at least tells you to withdraw your coin before closing your account.
