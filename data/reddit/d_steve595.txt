Are we sure it wasn't because his name is "Dr. Nefario"? Because that honestly sounds like he'd be a Spider-man or Sonic villain or something.

SlidingMenu is sort of against the Android design guidelines. I'd go with a navigation drawer or a SlidingPaneLayout, depending on the pattern.

Thus making the practice of tracking images useless, at least for all gmail users. So it is helping.

It's mainly a UX difference.
SlidingMenu (old): The sliding menu is underneath the main content view, so you're sliding the main app view to reveal the menu.
SlidingPaneLayout: Very similar, a bit more refined code-wise. Main difference is the Back and Up commands should take the user back to the sliding menu. So the sliding menu is like the root view of the app, and the content view is contextual. Hangouts uses this pattern.
Navigation Drawer: Different action, different feel. Like SPL, it's a root menu for the app, used to navigate around top-level parts. However, it is brought _above_ the content view, which is why it can only be pulled out from the edge of the screen (or by its button).

I think they are too!
If you want to trade smaller amounts, maybe try local trading? 
It's sketchier (think Craigslist) but there's no exchange, so no fees/minimums.
And don't worry about paying back. It's nothing.

Right, and it also makes fakeaccount123bot appear just as valid.
Spammers will catch onto the fact that _every single Gmail account is appearing valid_ pretty quickly. I'd bet some have already. And then, their data is useless.

What's your wallet address?

All root-enabled apps have this.

Worked perfect in Windows, thanks!
Two things, though:
1. I had to start the server by just running "bitcoind.exe" and doing the rest in another command window.
and 2. There's another argument after the passphrase. It's supposed to be "bitcoind walletpassphrase timeoutinseconds".

I think people say it because "internet mining corporation" sounds totally badass.

You should get a medal for your explaining skills.

Would it be possible (read: feasible) for someone to write a miner utilizing them properly? Or are they just too arcane to work with?

Price was about $13, I put up a listing for 10 BTC @ MtGox + 10%, PayPal USD. Got three responses, picked his, as he named an actual price ($144) and the others wanted to negotiate.
We talked a bit, he convinced me to pay the BTC first (I was seriously stupid, I see now) because he had more positive reviews, etc.
I told him I sent the BTC, but it was unconfirmed. He asked for the transaction info, I sent it. He said thanks, was very polite. I've sent him many messages and emails since then, no response.

I did, but it said no keys found. And the keys looked something like this: keys = []

I pulled a foil Sphinx's Revelation at a draft yesterday. How many bitcoins will you give me for it?
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:18:30
My point exactly. A bank being hurt won't do too much damage to a fiat currency, but to Bitcoin, an emerging one, it'll wreak havok. Especially when it's on the medium (the Internet) on which the attack is done.

Tor is nothing even close to a modified version of Firefox.

Yeah, a subreddit showing different, opposing opinions is pretty crazy. Almost like there's more than one person posting on it.
