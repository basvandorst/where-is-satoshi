We are almost out of runway (~76% of bitcoins have been mined). If Bitcoin can't gain mass traction soon, it will be toasted by double spend attacks once miners shut down!!! We have only a few years left to get there (imo ~4-8 years).

Without inspiration from the Coinbase Bithack, I don't think I would have had the gumption to do BTC Ring 2.O. My Bithack submission has its own Engadget story!
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:48:43
One of the main features of a bitcoin ring is reduce worries about ring loss. Having gems on the ring negates this feature. 
Also, I would argue gemstones are about conspicuous consumption, so the bitcoin address needs to be easy to read and not secretly engraved anywhere.
As for design, the next version will look better, but the function and idea remain the same!

Excellent question! Linking to a QR code you do not actually control or printing the same QR code for multiple girlfriends is what I call a "relationship double spend." To solve this issue, the giver should use "blockchain inscriptions" (similar to how rings have personalized inscriptions). 
To inscribe messages linked to the ring address, simply send some Bitcoin from the ring address to the address that is the BASE58 encoding of your message (plus the header and checksum). The recipient of the ring should read these blockchain inscriptions using our app to ensure the giver isn't performing a "relationship double spend" on them.

1) I just submitted this (and the accompaning app and website) to the Coinbase hackathon. I am serious about this idea.
2) I really do believe this could be one of Bitcoin's killer app. This engagement ring is functionally superior to a diamond engagement ring. If marketed correctly, bitcoins may have their place in jewelry alongside gold and diamonds which would do wonders for adoption.

Thank god, i was worried before i saw the /s. The miners need to be incentivized long term or else the security of bitcoin transactions goes down   
@_date: 2015-05-09 02:59:13
Most certainly not! As transaction fees replace mining rewards, incentives for miners change in such a way that the distribution between block interarrivals changes from exponential to ... some other distribution (described in the paper). I ask the question of how this may affect the probability of double spending in the Bitcoin blockchain since confirmations won't follow a Poisson process in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:25:13
I haven't seen anything out there yet on the distribution of interarrival time between blocks. This is my first pass at analyzing how this distribution may evolve in Bitcoin and its effect the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.

@_date: 2015-05-09 03:05:31
This paper addresses how the distribution of time between successive blocks changes as a result of different mining incentive structures. It also addresses  how this changing distribution affects the security of the network.
It is certain that as the mining reward goes to zero, the distribution of time between blocks will no longer be exponentially distributed. The jist of the paper is to determine how this affects the probability of double spending in the Bitcoin blockchain since confirmations won't follow a Poisson process in the future. (all previous analysis the author has seen assume confirmations follow a Poisson process)
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:28:36
Yes, the miners are incentivized for smaller blocks for the immediate future. I wonder how far out they think about their revenues.

The 25 BTC coinbase reward effectively goes to 0 BTC in a decade. If transaction fees don't replace the coinbase reward, the network is fuqqed. Getting a large amount in tranaction fees will be essential.
And don't give me that horseshit about the reward not going to 0 for a hundred more years. Fixed coinbase mining incentives will *effectively* dissapear in a matter of years.

@_date: 2017-02-14 13:33:34
Ability to transact trumps all. Without a lot of energy spent on mining, Bitcoin will be doublespent against and then bitcoin transactions cant be relied on. Miners need to stay incentivized long term.
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:59:16
But the extra phase is not protected against brute force like BIP38 is. So if you store the 24 words and the secret phrase is just another word, you are screwed against an attacker who has your trezor. Maybe the PIN will buy you time, but sidechannels to get the stored private key likely exist out there.
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:24:41
Absolutely. This has an effect on the distribution of interarrivals between blocks. The main chain will no longer grow as a Poisson process (i.i.d. exponential interarrival times), but as a renewal process (iid interarrival times). This has many interesting effects. Most importantly it affects probability of double spending and hence blockcain security. Here is a writeup i made a while back (i have many more ideas/results beyond what is written now, ask if interested)

Bicointalk thread:
I have also talked to Tim Swanson. He does not think the incentives for miners will become dynamic, and hence all miners will mine at "full power" 100% of the time (I disagree).
There is also this:
In their model, miners complete turn off after a block and then completely turn on after some time. My model assumes some "ramp up" of mining after the last block. These authors are also aware of my work.

Please see my writeup below, i actually calculate what the new distribution is which implicitly gives the new variance of time between blocks. It turns out the variance decreases in Bitcoins future.

Yes, but the reward from transaction fees changes with time  whereas a fixed block reward is fixed. It is not well understood if Bitcoin mining incentives "work out" in the transaction fee dominated era. See the paper "bitcoin mining is unstable" (or something like that)

The "runway" is the total amount of fixed coinbase reward left to incentivize miners. The runway is disappearing fairly fast... over 90% of the runway will be used up in about 5 years from now. No runway left and negligible reward from transaction fees is a recipe for double spending.
