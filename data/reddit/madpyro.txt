The difference is that in NYC the poor can't even own a shack. Lots of people in trailers though in other parts of the country. I guess that's the US equivalent.

At this point it's futile to keep measuring it in thousands of dollars. Consider that 16k "only" needs a 25% rise to reach 20k.

For now, cryptocurrency is tied to fiat. All business who accept it only do so because they can exchange it for fiat. That's the only thing giving it value these days. We're still a loooong ways off for the coin having any value in itself.

The exchanges still operate on fiat. Seize their assets and have their webhost and banks deny them service. Don't fool yourself into thinking it's not an option to shut it down, or seizing assets from overseas exchanges. It's trivial to do.

Well, I disagree.

Wow you have to be retarded to think that trump would willingly give anything away.

Shut down the exchanges. Ban transfers to exchanges. The price would plummet immediately.

I always love waiting an hour for my transaction to clear at a yard sale! ;)
