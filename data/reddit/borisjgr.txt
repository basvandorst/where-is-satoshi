None of those broadcast were pit out on channels that have 250,000+ subscribers. 
When they say the SuperBowl has X million viewers, they aren’t saying that that number of people sat down and watched 100% of the game.   100,000 people watch some portion of the races.

Yessir, hope those guys have a breakout year!

This is all about mobile.   Are there any solid mobile competitors on the horizon?

Do it. �� Post pics

You can’t resize the number, the sim places it for you, but enlarging the text can be done. Good feedback.

With a mobile app? That’s the key? No iPhone app, No Coinbase takedown.

Reach on Facebook is how many people got a timeline delivery. This race Reached 360,000 people and was viewed by 104,000.  It’s not a random league series.  The iRacing Youtube Channel has 70k subscribers.  The page this is hosted on has 260k.
Edited: I was being a jerk with a couple unnecessary comments. Apologies.  Felt like my honesty was being questioned &amp; got defensive.

Thanks! This is on iRacing.   We run Sunday’s at 8p ET  on Facebook.com/JoeGibbsRacing

No argument here haha

You’re right.

I’m shocked it’s only 30%
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:32:35
One channel has 70k Race fan subscribers, the other has nearly 4 times that. If it’s surprising to you that the one with more subscribers gets higher viewership on a broadcast, I’m not sure there’s much point in continuing the conversation. Take care &amp; hodl.

You should try the new dirt iracing if you get a chance to fire up the sim again. Incredible experience once you get the hang of it.

Dang. That’s true.

Thanks for posting this. First I’ve heard of the card.  I wonder how they manage the no-fee BTC to USD. 
Anyway, cool stuff. I’m excited to tell my friends who are suspicious of the practicality of bitcoin.

Can you check the link? I tried to open and it goes to an odd iTunes Store web page for me. I’m on an up to date iPhone and would like to check it out.

Increased my hodlings when it was at 11,500!  The way it’s looking, I’m happy with that timing.

Until there’s an alternative app that works well on iOS, Coinbase is the only realistic option. If I’m missing one please let me know. I want to switch.

More fragile than it was as a bubble?

Not sure of the backstory, but there is one. And it had a big spike this year, but again, not sure why.

What about Bitcoin Good Friday?  Because like Easter’s Good Friday, everyone (else) thought he was dead and gone, but in 3 Days he was risen.

Is one mBTC = 0.01?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:57
While you wait for someone more experienced than me, I can tell you that the Ledger wallet offers a lot of info when you buy one, and they may even offer info in your native language.

You haven’t missed the boat. You can purchase fractions of a bitcoin. You don’t have to buy a whole one. Typically, because of fees, $100 is a good starting point. But that’s not a hard and fast rule. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:49:19
Is there a hi res version of this or something similar that represents the bitcoin blockchain? Would be a great convo starter for an office poster. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:16:55
ELI5 please: if bitcoin is worth $1 Mil, and is now the standard, how much actual purchasing power would that one bitcoin have? Theoretically.

NASCAR team exec here.  As a bitcoin believer, I’d love for this to happen with the team I’m a part of, but at the very least, I can help lay a realistic road map to make this happen no matter what team it happens with, to help the cause. 
Here are the basics:
- sponsorships involving placement on-car are typically broken down on a per-race basis.  Many teams these days will require a minimum spend on 3-6 races, though some of the poorer performing once’s will take one race deals. As an example, the team I work for would have a certain number of available races on a car(s) and would have a minimum price per race. Obviously, more successful and well-performing drivers would demand a higher price.  But it’s worth it for several reasons I’m laying out here. 
- Driver and team prominence helps brand exposure, like any sport.  NASCAR is covered by NBC and FOX in America.  But as you all know, the world we live in, social media marketing can amplify branding and content even if the driver doesn’t win a race. 
Here’s why NASCAR works for brands/companies:
- The other benefit of partnering with a prominent team over a low cost team is the partnership you get with their other sponsors.  B2B is the biggest return for NASCAR team sponsors.   Imagine one team has a shipping company as a sponsor (A) and a sponsor that sells OTC products (B).  Currently the OTC products are shipped by a competitor to (A), but the race team gets the right people together to convince (B) to ship with (A).   Suddenly the whole sponsorship for (A) is paid for by a real sale.    Now, imagine the legitimacy Bitcoin gains by being partnered with Fortune500 companies.  What would happen if the right people were able to be convinced about the validity of accepting bitcoin, simply because of the relationship with the race team? 
- Buying the whole car is the right choice as OP suggested.   If Bitcoin was on 8-12 races, a deal could be worked out to have smaller placement on all 38 races while other sponsors are on the hood.
