It is though.


This is true of a stock for example, because you can't buy food with stocks. It is not necessarily true with bitcoin. Speculators can hold onto it forever and still be speculators. This is because they can buy something with the currency and their speculation is based on the worth of that currency increasing relative to the price of goods.


This sounds like wishful thinking on the part of late investors. The price has been rising and dropping, but the trend is always rising. We have already hit many milestones that should have seen these speculators drop everything. I am sure many did, but many more are waiting. If a 5x increase in price didn't cause this massive end of world drop, what will exactly?
You see, by the time bitcoin hits its peak, the people who held on will have no incentive to drop at all. They will have bitcoins, and those bitcoins will be ubiquitous because that is only way bitcoin would have hit its peak. This means bitcoin will be an established currency by this time and the game is over.
When do you expect all the speculators to drop? Try to answer that question. You will find that many people can keep small amounts of bitcoin in terms of what they think is small, and they will hold onto them, and hold onto them, because there will need to be a 100x price rise for them to really care. So they will all be holding, but then hey, bitcoin will be everywhere and useful.
Ultimately what gets bitcoin beyond all of this speculation and to success is its merit. It appears to be a much better form of currency then existing forms of currency.
