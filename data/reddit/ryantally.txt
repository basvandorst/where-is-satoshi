I think you shut down your server?

Awesome! Great advice. All of these points is what lead me to want to do this, apart from a meet up group, bitcoin is non existent in my town. We have 180,000 ish residents, mainly students. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:20:44
To soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:50:28
Me! Was planning on waiting till $50.00, but I saw blood and when in went up from 176.00 to 190.00. I knew the bottom is now 170.00. Fucking stoked.... I bought 5Btc. I made money while I slept! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:57:08
I have been buying since 2013. At this point I am up by thousands. I am once a year buyer/seller. I like to diversify. So, if it is around 7 to 800 in a year I will sell half of my total bitcoins and then wait for another crash, then buy more. Wash, rinse, repeat... Forever. I know its not a complicated plan, but it has worked, even if they go to 0, I am still in the black! 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:49:17
Buy  sell  Made 400 bucks today. Looks like I'm about to be buying a lot more soon.... 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:58:53
I really think this is your company.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:54:46
That is what I was thinking, dude could retire right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:55:31
Right. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:22:55
You are very welcome. You might get lucky and find another Swed in the sub reddit. They could have some more in sight. Feel free to subscribe to and dont let the hatters in the sub bother you. Everyone is a noob at some point.

That is if social security is around in 30 years. Its projected to have a thirty percent decrease in pay out in 20 years. So, I would not include that in my retirement, at all. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:41:04
Awesome. Thank you very much, I like it. "Bitcoin Integration" Sounds fancy... Lets do a little math though. If I "Integrate", lets say 50 business that would be 20k, which would be nice, but where do I go from there? How do I keep making residual income? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:52:38
I'm not allowed to illegally download movies.... Just saying.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:22:35
Well it depends if the government decides to rob it some more between then and now. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:09:02
You need to make your own decisions with your money and where it goes and by whom, but if I lived in Sweden this is who I would use. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:54:29
You are right, but it really does not help the cause for legitimacy.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:24:08
Wish I could opt out of that shit. I would rather invest that money myself. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:23:02
Do think there could be a day when it is set up on a credit system? Perhaps Coinbase starts offering credit for customers to use with their merchants? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:51:41
I did not say bottom, I said there was blood, meaning people were selling and panicking, I bought below 200. Also, I have been using, buying and selling since 2013. Let it fall, let it rise, does not matter. Everything cycles, everything. You have no idea and neither do I. We can just use the information we gather and assume. I have a plan of selling and buying yearly and it has worked for me so far. Also, like I said, I am in the black regardless, are you? Stop being a dick and read what I wrote before firing off and being a dick, dick. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:01:03
Could you not use square also? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:29:17
$50 is my mark. That was the last time I bought. It will hit it before the end of the month, IMO you heard it here first. I will then buy 3k worth, half of my profit from when I bought at $50 last time. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:42:07
Good luck OP. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:18:13
This dips bottom, sorry. I am mistaken, I did in fact say that. I meant this current drops bottom, excuse me. You were kinda of still being a dick though. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:30:44
Jesus... Christ...... This could not get any better. I should write a screen play.

Is Barr even a real person?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:21:29
How did you exchange your currency into bitcoin? Back then there were very few ways. This is where I would start. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:32:51
Sorry, I missed a step in that. Let me edit. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:27:56
Well, actually back then you could deposit directly into your wallet using Bank Of America. Man, I say this like it was ages ago. I remember the days when I was buying 9 dollar coins :) 
Edit. the Bank then wired the money to the exchange. I don't remember the exchange it was on TOR and I was using it just for the Silk Road. College man, but I do remember BOA was the only way to get cash into my wallet. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:36:33
Is this the same guy? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:15:22
"It would be better off to fix the issues." How? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:33:42
I think it means he gets off on the murder for hire charge and this will only help his appeal for the convictions. The cops were clearly entrapping him and then just pocketing the murder for hire money. Look on page 26. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:15:37
Page 26 will get Ross out of the murder for hire charges.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:13:07
I think in fact they did. The tweet from the lawyer implies that for sure.
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:20:21
Funny story about that though. It is true that the dude was a scam artist and just robbed the whole site and then killed it. Fucking bastard that Guy. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:45:28
This guy who they interviewed is a thief. He closed Atlantis and took peoples bitcoins. True story. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:20:47
You are right. He robbed the whole site.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:08:19
Quick Question. I seem to remember there being an AMA about some guy starting his own type of SR? What was the name? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 12:29:39
Hindsight, never see the signs. I did think it was weird though and quiet ballsy to come to Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:59:58
Redandwhite and Friendly chemist are the same guy
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:14:19
Probably a stupid question, but how hard would it to be make a debit/credit card connected to you bitcoin wallet? The transaction would then send the coins to the retail or service providers wallet?
