Not a really a “dynasty”. My family is wealthy family of like merchants and things like that. Someone used to import stuff to the country and export things to other countries near by and was the first at doing it. That inheritance law is complicated because its set up as a religious law. So right now my grandfather is trying to make sure that whatever happened does not happen again. My Mom has various autoimmune and chronic diseases and if she dies before her father, we get nothing again. Its a religious inheritance law in a specific prominent country in the middle east. There is voting on laws, they are set a long time ago. So basically if you’re supposed to inherent a lot of money and your siblings or cousins don’t like you or want more, they could get rid of you and then you will inherit nothing which will make your children inherit nothing. So basically your inheritance dies with you, but its split up by your brothers and their children and not your children (if you die).

Probably more. Can’t say that I understand everything 100%. It’s fascinating how the more I read and the more that I think about it, the more that I understand. Or sometimes I have an epiphany. I’ve spent two years reading about and trying to understand Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. 
If I could talk to anyone from the past that’s dead or alive, I’d chose Satoshi Nakamoto. I’m pretty sure that talking to him and getting into his head would help us see what he thinks, believes, and envisions. I find him more fascinating than Bitcoin itself. They should find him and keep his brain �� just like how they kept Einstein’s Brain. ������

Oh. How old are you again? And what country do you live in? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:21:26
Haha I do that now besides the Heroin part (I don’t fuck with needles). I got fucked over by inheritance law in my country. I was supposed to inherit a small percentage of 3 Billion Dollars, but the way the law is set up it fucks you over if your parent dies. So for example, if my father dies before my grandfather, I get nothing because my father died. Its some fucked up game of thrones shit. My uncles and aunts would get my father’s share and split it with their children, meanwhile my father’s children would get $0. Same thing works for the mother’s side. Also, this applies to grandfathers and great grandfathers. If your 100+ year old Great Grandfather died, but your grandfather died before him. You, your family, your uncles and aunts and their children would get fucked in the ass. (I can’t tell you who died and fucked us over). I’m from a place that has more money than any other country on earth. 
So as you can see i’ve already experienced having everything right in front of me, but not being able to have it or losing it all. It was at that moment that I started developing my Contingency Plan. You’ll probably never see anyone that lost more than me (inheritance wise). I’ve had a good life, but have experienced some shit that left a stain on me. I can’t comply because it made me who I am today. 
Maybe I should do an AMA ������.

Can’t say right now. It’s very long and meticulous. It’s something that will save me one day and I hope that I would never have to resort to. I have been working on it for years to negate any unforeseen circumstances. Whatever I have will not work for most people. My contingency plan will not go in effect unless a catastrophic event happens or I lose everything somehow so that I won’t use it when I’m drunk or high or anything like that. My contingency has to do with where i’m from and what resources they got there. I can’t say anymore.

Really? Now you ask about them? 6 years later
The simple answer is that they are among the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins. Thank you for contributing to the amount of lost Bitcoins and making the supply a little lesser than what it used to be. One day they will count all the BTCs that have not been touched in a decade and maybe maybe the price will go up because of that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:49:40
Were you doing Meth in school instead of Math? 
Formula = Number of Bitcoins x Price 
and to calculate value of other alts you could use this for Example. Let’s say Reddcoin or any other ShitCoin/Altcoin
Right now its at 11 Satoshis(0.00000011 BTC). If you buy 1,000,000 RDD at 11 Sats, they would cost you 0.11 BTC. Amount of Altcoin x the price. And then you multiply that 0.11 BTC by the value of Bitcoin in USD. 
1M RDD x 0.00000011 BTC = 0.11 BTC * $10,000 (BTC Price) = $1,100
To calculate profit, Change the Price of the Coin and the value of btc if it changed. 
For Example:
1,000,000 RDD x 0.00001100 BTC = 11BTC * $10,000 (BTC Price) = $110,000 (Subtract the $1,100 from above and you’ll get the profit).

You know how when a person that is expected to next in line for a king succession dies, his children lose the chance to become potential kings. And the throne goes to the Potential King’s siblings rather his sons because he died before he became king. 
The Inheritance Law in that Country works the same way. It is designed to fuck people over and have family member fuck each other out of their inheritance. Some real life Game of Thrones shit.

Haha. My friend pays zero minus the hardware cost. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:26:29
Yeah I get that. I wonder if banks would charge an international fee like how mine does with Coinbase because they charge me from London or some shit like that. So I end up paying fees left and right. 
If anyone from Coinflash reads this. Are the transactions made outside if the U.S.?

It depends on how you look it. It could have sentimental value or great as a collectible. Its worthless, but it could be used to scam people and become of worth until you sell them.

Isn’t the guy in the White from Fast and Furious Tokyo? Wow he changed a lot the last 10-14 years. Haven’t seen him in American movies since then. Did he get banned from the U.S. or something?

Look up Mark Cuban again. Today he contradicts himself. Today he said that its the future, late July he said that its a scam and a bubble.

You understood what I meant. By profit, I meant what they collected. A small portion of that would actually go to “Public Services” The roads are Fucking shitty here. Nails, potholes...and I live in the wealthiest county. Police that make you fear them rather than feel safe and embrace their presence. An Army that spends most of the time at War in countries that they didn’t need to get involved in. The Hospitals and healthcare are the worse in terms of standards compared to Europe and Canada. So much corruption. We spend more on healthcare than most countries, yet we have lower quality (I study this shit). Useless taxes, shitty infrastructure, so much inefficiencies everywhere even medical inefficiencies. Most of the time, most of what is collected from taxes is not spent on what it is intended to, but goes somewhere else or goes nowhere. I can’t believe that I’m saying this, but that Orange fuck played it right when he exploited that loophole to avoid paying the IRS on taxes. 
I also live in another country without taxes, I pay less. No income taxes, no taxes on profits, no sales tax. Oil and Gas cheaper than water. Electricity cheaper than the U.S. I feel safer there. Cops don’t shoot and kill people. Cops are trained and actually know their shit.
In my opinion, the IRS has outlived its original purpose and has turned into something else. Doesn’t matter if you like what I said or not. Just throwing it out there. I don’t pay taxes and won’t pay taxes.

I noticed that the buy price is always $10 higher than the current price/value of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:43:45
Even if you don't use your Credit/Debit Card and use the USD wallet instead, you still pay $10 above the market price + The 4% Transaction Fee
