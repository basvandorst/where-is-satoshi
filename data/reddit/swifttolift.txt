Guys, there's nothing wrong with the van but I see an opportunity and believe VeChain will be a top hold for 2018 and beyond so I figure I can just get another van after I cash out initial investment. 
About the van: ford transit jumbo 2.2l diesel. All service history included with the van. 
4m length in cargo, 1.76 wide and about 1.85 tall inside. 
All the tyres are fine and shouldn't have issue passing road worthy. The rego expires in Jan. 
I got this originally to live in and I have been the past 2 months but I have another van so I'm fine. 
There's no real reason I'm selling this.. the gear box was also rebuilt and still has warranty if anything goes wrong. 
I don't know what else to say. It's a great solid vehicle and I put months of research into finding a good van so I think someone will be stoked with this :)

Oh I definitely plan to hodl ;) maybe Coinbase will bring in selling sometime in the future but I'm going to keep putting in 150 or so a week or more. I am not afraid to lose my money so no issue for me. I feel very late for the bitcoin train though :(

Oh btw this is a long term investment for me, I will hodl for years. I was just concerned about the sell feature. I'Ve watched bitcoin since last year when it was at like 600. At this rate though, I could see it definitely growing more in the long haul :)

Do I have to send my bitcoin to another wallet on a selling website, then sell it that way?

Hodl all the way ��
