For all the bashing in this sub of the car going on; this is actually a good way to teach new people about bitcoin. They set up the car in different locations and pretty much converse/explain bitcoin to the people.
You get people who have no clue  what Bitcoin is coming in to learn how to win the car and may actually come out with some useful knowledge about Bitcoin that they might have otherwise never sought out.

Incentive, incentive, incentive; what is the incentive for merchants to do this? What do they (we) gain by losing money?
My fees for fiat are not near 5%, my fees for Bitcoin are also not 0 because I used a processor that charges 1%. 
Offering these discounts doesn't really create new users; and what Bitcoin needs most is exactly that.

Interesting; I have two questions.
**First**, how easily will it be to setup a store, I don't have a programming background but am above average in terms of technical competence (as are most Bitcoiners). I don't know how to compile programs or setup my own servers; will this be a fairly easy client with a robust UI?
**Second**, how will the shipping calculations work. I have two webstores that run on opencart, the shipping is fairly easy to calculate cost based on total cart weight. I know some other Bitcoin market projects have only per product shipping. This is an issue because in Canada we have some minimums for shipping that aren't an problem when total cart weight is considered but can add up if it's static (adds a set $ value for each product).

Hahaha I am an idiot. I looked at all the negative data, trends and current events and backed away from investing in the stock market, looked at all the innovation, upcoming projects, new large merchants, market signals and put my money into Bitcoin. Wow I am dumb, I should just go around doing the most nonsensical and illogical things to get ahead.
Shit, I mean I should have invested in Twitter &amp; Facebook, I know they didn't actually make much or sometimes any money and didn't really have a realistic way to scale up revenue even with advertising; but they are so great, they even paid $19 Billion for a messaging app, only 13 times Facebooks net income for that year; what a steal, we know Zucker is no sucker.
If only I could have foresight and realize that companies who make apps that let you send "erasable" dick &amp; tit pics could be worth over $2 Billion; then I could put all of my money into glorious monuments to human ingenuity such as this.
This is the key, these companies can only grow; this why I should have put money into those types of things and not this Bitcoin thing, which is obviously a bubble.
Edit: I got it guys, I am developing an app to compete with Snapchat and Instagram, this proprietary venture will combine the best of both. Snapgram will now combine the eras-ability of snapchat with the quality filters of Instagram. Want to whiten that asshole before you send it to your personal trainer? No problem, the bleaching filter will make your mauve colored butthole turn into a gorgeous lavender pink. What about you gentlemen; trying to impress that cute dental hygienist? The shader will allow you to paint your cock any color of the rainbow. The app will also be integrated with ratemybutthole, ratemycock, ratemytits and many other social sharing sites so that everyone could like and share your perfected creations. Offering 10% to VC for a measly sum of $25 M, IPO expected in 6 mo.

I was one the first few vendors on there (Wisdom Survival), at one time the largest in 2013 (around april or may), needless to say there were barely any sales, I had one sale and this was a few months after listing, there invoice number was pretty low so  unless it was randomized the site really wasn't gaining that much traction. In the early days it was also a huge pain the ass to post, the site would log you out after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity and you'd have to restart your listing. There were also weird glitches where whenever you edited your listing you would have to re-upload the picture and certain characters weren't allow in listing like long dashes, but you wouldn't know what the problem was, you'd have to screen through your text and try to see why the system wouldn't accept your description. It's been a few months since i've used the site, I thought it had potential, I guess it just didn't take off.

If you're knowingly using a pool that's close to or is mining the majority of the blocks, when there are smaller pools that will give you the same amount of btc (after fees), you need to switch asap.

I think people who tip waiters (who don't know about bitcoin) in bitcoin are assholes. I also know that way too many bitcoiners gloss over the risks.
What I think is beneficial is moving in the direction of making Bitcoin more user friendly via third party apps, easy to use wallets, things like Trezor; as well as easy-to-read, readily available educational materials to those who are curious/want to learn.

VOS was the best exchange in Canada imo; incredibly easy to transfer funds from the bank through direct deposit, relatively low fees and a super quick verification process (took me about a day).

Any suggestions of alternatives would be appreciated.

Anyone who could potentially create a good web wallet for Opera mini or app (if the phone could download and run third party apps) should jump on the boat.

If it's still at 0 confirmations after about 3 days it'll drop out of the mempool and be in the same wallet address you attempted to send it from.
This site will give you an idea of how long it will take to get confirmations based on the fee you paid:
Find your transaction on blockchain.info. It will tell you the satoshis per byte (fee) you ended up using.
An alternative to getting your transaction through sooner is to import your priv keys into a wallet that has RBF and add extra btc to the transaction fees. (I haven't done this myself so I am not 100% sure on this).

100% BTC so far, probably because we've focused almost all of our advertising on Bitcoin Black Friday, that and higher discounts for using Bitcoin as opposed to paypal. [Wisdom Survival Kits]( if anyone is curious.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:03:23
I pay 1% with Bitpay with no monthly fee. Paypal charges me 2.9% + $0.30 so I usually pay 3-4% per transaction which isn't terrible but still significantly more.
The big draw is that you can set it automatically convert into USD or CAD, so for vendors who don't want the risks associated with price volatility they can set it to 0-100% USD. That way they can still accept bitcoins on their site and receive funds partially or fully in another currency.
Yes, I chose to sell mostly on my own site using an ecommerce platform, the alternative of selling on Amazon and eBay would be extremely difficult. The only few items I can list there are ones that have my brand on them (no-one else sells them) and higher margins to get over that 10-12% rate charge.

Marginal costs vs marginal benefits, I get a much greater return on my advertising through Bitcoin channels than through general ones. 
Additionally, I have a large deterrent from listing the majority of my items on Amazon because I source a lot from the USA but am located in Canada. Customs and shipping soaks up a lot possible margin. 
If I had larger purchasing power this would be more attractive, I am going to experiment with Amazon to see if it will be higher than the nearest opportunity cost.
Thank you for the feedback.
