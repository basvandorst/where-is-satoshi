Guys I've made a mistake. I wanted to transfer some BTC from my Ledger Nano S to my Bittrex acc. Usually not the most difficult job. However, somehow I didn't press both buttons on my Nano Ledger to confirm the transaction (I only pressed the left button, so to reject, when I was grabbing my Nano Ledger..) Now my balance is 0 en my transaction is gone, however unconfirmed and I can do nothing to cancel this transaction. I also don't see anything pending on my Bittrex account. Does anyone know how long this will take before the money will be send back to me? I see the following here:  
This is a little bit worrying cause Ledger says they can't do anything about it and I'll just have to wait before I get my money back...... Hope someone can help me or give me some trust. It was not just a couple of bucks.... Thnx

I'm an alt trader. With all of them (which I have now) I'm making nice profits or I'm break-even my investment. I just have one really poor investment. Back in June I bought an altcoin which was booming, it was my first coin so my knowledge about crypto's was zero. I bought it at ATH leading to a loss of 700euro from a total investment of 1k euro. I'm thinking about selling all these coins of that crypto and let it rest into BTC. Would that be a smart move? I know you should never sell at low but it will more likely rise if it becomes BTC. Eventually I can buy it all back in case this altcoin will ever rise again (and my BTC value has increased in the mean time).
