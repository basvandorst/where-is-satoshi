Their version of getting hacked is losing their key, getting phished, making an irreversible accidental txn. It’s a legitimate concern, they are going to call it a hack if they lose money regardless of the way lost it

“The system is mathematically airtight, every time a transaction occurs, it gets verified by computers all over the world. People who run these computers verify it by solving a tough math problem and a get a small compensation for doing it. The reason this is secure is because it’s backed by mathematics, the security is not because of code, it’s due to the math, there are millions of miners, even if you corrupt a few thousand miners computers their results would rejected because their output did not match the mathematical result of the rest of the computers.”
This actually worked for my uncle

So is this more like a shop belonging to a payment channel “network”, multiple shops agree to be part of same payment channel, and you can transact at any of them ? And if any one of the shop in the payment channel network connects to a shop on another network, they merge?

It actually makes a lot more sense. They probably have some insurance if the bank loses it and banks are pretty secure for this kind of stuff. Blindly calling anything not on the Blockchain as insecure is just idiotic

Knowing all that does not make you a millionaire, aggressive traders from wall st most definitely have started trading btc and would’ve made millions easily just over the last week. You just want to think you are better than most people because you have some knowledge, which most people don’t even need to trade and benefit off of btc.

Most of them want to hear how it benefits their donors. That’ll tell them what stance to take.

Do you have to setup a payment channel for every store? What if you’re on a trip and want to buy something from a random store quickly?

Why are you afraid to doubt those pictures? Why is it a coincidence that those pictures perfectly align with your previously held beliefs? Why is it that you're afraid of challenging the truth? why is that you're afraid of challenging the veracity of these pictures? You've no problems challenging everything and anything, but when it comes to those pictures, you give it a pass, you close your eyes and take it in without question, you actually welcome it, how convenient. Why are you afraid of inconvenient truths? I know doubting the pictures makes you uncomfortable, I know you don't like that feeling, you want run away, therefore you choose not to challenge those pictures, choosing to run away, choosing to be a coward, choosing to never look at inconvenient truths in the face.
