What happens when someone is buried with cash versus if someone dies with all of their money (assuming no debt) in their bank account?  
A bank account would be picked up by next of kin, I imagine, assuming anyone else had access to the account.

The weird thing about Bitcoin is that your money would be worth more when they dug you up, almost certainly.  This stuff hurts my head.

It’s going to be real interesting when we can trace where missing/deceased individuals coins go on the blockchain after the fact.  Follow the money.
Governments are losing their unaccountability.

All I need to know about American politicians I can learn by looking at our military spending to education ratio.  It’s that simple.
We’re not in debt because of schools; I’ll tell you that.

That's such a bad argument.  Half our taxes are spent on war.

Because they got banned.  Can we change the account settings to only let active/long term members in?  They’re all spamming.

For real.  I have a QR code on my business cards.  They’re not rocket science.

Technology improves over time as well, allowing fewer individuals to “mine” more than their predecessors.  Look at the entire Railroad system in the United States and how much money it created in taxes...then compare that to the international automotive industry of today.

I’m more worried about accumulation.  The concentration of banks/exchanges/early adopters with crypto is a million times more unequal than with fiat.  I love the idea of bitcoin, but it’s not the Robinhood-esque wealth dispersing tool everyone thinks it is.
Please convince me otherwise because I really want to be wrong on this one.

Assuming the majority of coins are held by a small amount of the rich &amp; coin exchanges, would a crash be a hard reboot in distribution or would everything happen the same way again, ten years later?

Of course it’s for accumulation.  One of the most frivolous, constant and impulse purchases of generations of humans for decades has been coffee.
It’s terrifying to think of Starbucks revenue increasing Bakkt’s holdings exponentially.  And it’s likely Bakkt’s marketing of Starbucks will increase their sales as well.
Isn’t this similar to if a chain in the US started accepting Venezuelan currency at a discount to your purchase?  Who would step in to regulate?  Is there even any regulation at this point?

Everyone forgets that if/when this currency “moons,” if will affect the USD disproportionately and extremely negatively.
Our country’s debt is debt just like any other, and we can’t continue to put off paying it.  Just the fact that if goes up and up every year despite our GDP also increasing show how unsustainable this  system is.
The real question to ask is, WHEN will America default on its loan, who will we default that debt to, and what real world (possibly military or land concessions) will that result in?

I hope you’re right.  It just needs to be more profitable to be green than current policies allow. Change will only come through economics, not emotion.
How did carbon taxes perform though?
