he did a chargeback, and got his money back. he essentially stole my property. It was only right to take it back
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:17:36
Can i state the obvious?! Obviously the markets are getting manipulated so that the Real big fish [and im not talking about silly crypto whales] the ones with millions and billions of liquid fiat can enter the market at a fairly cheap price
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:43:30
yes thats exactly what happened.
But thankfully i told support i got hacked and i got my rogue back.. DOUBLE CHARGEBACK FTW, but im still shit out of 300$ that i had spent before paypal requested the money back - i still think its their fault and should eat the expense since theyre the ones insured, not me.

because it happened after i downloaded a few PnD wallets
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:30:57
i dont know why the downvotes:
obviously someone is crashing the price so that big whales can enter the market cheaply; specifically before the winklevoss btc investment fund hits NYSE
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:24:15
Nothing is more annoying than being preached about the future, and ignoring that future, and realizing you missed out on the future...

nothing is anonymous, if you can trace a blockchain transaction you can sure as shit trace an IP from a username. 
adding a face to some of the comments/users would add credibility and reduce some of the darker shit reddit has produced

@_date: 2014-10-27 21:26:26

right, i still believe in psuedo - anonymity, however if i wish to share personal information such as my identity and location, i should be able to do that in order to establish/create a community
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:21:36

@_date: 2015-01-27 03:32:24

@_date: 2015-03-25 07:47:14
all the fucking artificial volume from being able to leverage your position x20 is what is causing these choppy waters.
