I just got verified a few days ago, and it took about 5 weeks. If it has been almost a month you will probably be verified in another week.

Thanks for the rant, but I am well aware of all this. Unfortunately,  it was after I had BTCs on there that I read about it. And I agree is a great subtext. Much more informative than this one.

Unfortunately we have to be careful to avoid the same issues with bitcoin. I have had mine stuck on Mtgox for over 6 weeks now trying to get verified. It's ridiculous.  Why do I need verification to spend/ transfer bitcoins to another address? How can they allow you to bring them in if you can't move them?

If you haven't been, check out It has a lot more open discussions (pros and cons).

The benefit of allowing bitcoin donations is that the source of contribution can't be tracked. So if a politician doesn't want the voters to know he recieved $1 million from Exxon-Mobil, they can pay him in Bitcoins. Thus the incentive for politicians to allow it.

At my high school in California we had to take Health in 9th grade. We had a big unit on sex ed. We also had numerous guest speakers throughout the semester, including an ex con who had been on death row before being pardoned by Clinton. I still remember him telling us heroin is better than sex.

Those are exactly the kinds of discussions that occur at the US college level.

Did you mean to say "lost, versus stolen?"

Hmm... not a bad idea. Considering my last name is the same as my mom's I could probably just modify one of her bills. Thanks.
