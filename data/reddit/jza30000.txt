Thank you always for responding to me Oapie. Is that your name?  
I'm just gonna hold onto all my coins for now and see what happens. I think once BTC moves up, the rest of alts will follow in next 4-6 wks.  Hopefully that will happen..... Haha.  Do you participate in any ICOs?  What are you mostly focused on these days when the market is still going through corrections?

Wow.  I know you're a UBQ fan. I will def look into it !
So I can keep UBQ in an exchange and I still get the ESCH?
Like Bittrex?  That's ok?  THANK YOU RICHARD !!!!   
I take your advice and appreciate you !

Hey Oapie...  Have you read this?  What do you think about this? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:04:30
Holy shit !  15 diff paper wallets?  That's insane !  It's not good to store it in 1 cold storage?  
Thank you for all your info man !  I have all of those coins.  U still think UBQ will do some big things on 4/25?  I think that's what you mentioned?   Also.... which ICO do u participate in?  Have you had any good success with ICO lately?  I know WAN did pretty good which I'm still bullish on but I never got into those.  I got into Themis, Hybridblock, now Quark.  Pls advise.  Thanks again and you're super smart man.  I really appreciate all of your support !!!!
Cheers !

Thank you for always replying Oapie !  
So in this bear market, it looks like everything will go down even more.  So HODLing might not be the best answer?  What are you currently doing with yours?  Do we keep this shit in USDT or USD? 
I have so many coins that I'm just not touching right now.  What is your best opinion on how we should play this out for the next few months?   Lastly... do u think this will recover by end of this year? That's what I'm thinking right now. I can wait.  But if this shit's gonna last next couple of yrs and the price remains low, I might need to restrategize my game plan.  I'm still new, but have been studying a lot, but it's really depressing.  But I'm still optimistic about the blockchain !
Thank you !
