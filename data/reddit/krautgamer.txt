Thanks dude! :)

And while many may think “no shit, Sherlock”, this is actually huge. One of the biggest investment banks in the world is talking about bitcoin and not framing it as the end of society! Hell jost froze solid.

Nice move, but from a business standpoint it is very easy to ignore this. 
Adding a bad review to their mobile apps is a much better approach.

Just so I understand it a bit better. Can I just host a node, open a random payment channel, put a bitcoin in there and get some fees in return? 
Or what is the incentive?

That is the next project. :D

Yes, I run a small node on a pi in my office. That is only possible because devs are doing a tremendous job in keeping the needed infrastructure lean.
I use a pi because I don't want to spend more money/effort on it. But the actual target of Bitcoin (people in 3rd world countries that do not have stable internet and no access to trustworthy banking) HAVE to use limited infrastructure.
If you want to have trust, run your own node. If you need to run a node in a low infrastructure region, btc is your friend.

Thank you for making a poopiemess in my pants for a second. :D

Nice idea. I’ll send you a pm. I think posting IPs in public is a bad idea. (Random ddos victims.)
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:20:03
True. Will do.

Good fucking job on that platform. Next beer in Munich is on me!

If there is ever any sign of doubt:

Well. I kinda disagree about the cause, not the outcome. Torrents are dead, you're right about that. But the why is different in my eyes. 
I believe, that government intervention was just a bump in the road. The real killer was affordable, easy to use streaming services like Netflix or Spotify. That was the downfall of torrenting, because let's be honest: That shit was never easy enough for the broad market.

Ah, I see the story you're trying to spin here. Three points:
1) Trust. I have the freedom to run a bitcoin node and by that I have more trust in the network. Because I don't trust you, any institution or government with my bitcoin. That's the deal around here! 
2) Decentralization. Less nodes would point to a lot of potential attack surface. Take down 10 nodes today and we would not really care. Take down 10 Nodes out of 50, thats 20% of the system. Thats almost 2 Billion people that suddenly lost access to their banking.
3) Bcash. Your post history impressively shows you're a Bcash shill. I can't comprehend your intentions, but your ideology is clearly more centralization and stuff like bigger blocks. Fine. Do it! Fork and make an altcoin. Worked great with bcash. Not. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:03:40
Well, they have. 
But they are backed by so many institutions and governments, that countries would probably go to war over such an attack. But you don't have to take down the service, you just have to deny access. 
See egypt in 2011 for example. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:58:50
True. That is why I created this, it just got on my nerves. No fluff, no opinions, just the baseline fact.

I admire your will to learn. I really do! And the chances are good, that we're both wrong. 
Your point about the 13 million users on coinbase not caring to run a node is fair and true. They don't give a fuck. And they don't have to. Following your line of thought I also think that only a fraction of the network needs to consist of nodes to actually work. We disagree about the scale though. 
The real issue here is, that running a node has no tangible benefit, is kinda expensive to host in terms of Bandwidth and is a pain in the ass to set up. (Did it today.) But the devs should and are working on solving the problem of ease of use. 
And in terms of LN being far away. From the half ass knowledge I have we are about 3 or 4 months from early adoption in real life scenarios. Look at 1000 nodes already in the network. It's insane to do that now, but it proves a point.

Thanks for the insight. 
Question though: What makes you think the market is oversold? The books on most exchanges look pretty equal in both directions. Do you have data for that?
