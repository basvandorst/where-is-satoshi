I have been through rough times in my life being bullied and picked on when I was younger due to my race. It is not a laughing matter and I truly sympathize with this Japanese Canadian poster. I own some Doge and I am very concerned.

Ethereum is 'scheduled for release in the winter of 2014/2015'. In other words investing in them is about the same as playing craps right now. Hi risk could mean high reward but most likely it will fail.

I am very sad that a Doge-er who claimed to know a thing or two about racism would resort to name calling ..... much disappointed

Gox is gone. There is no reason for it to go down anymore. All the good news in the background over the past month will result in a steady increase for the next while.
