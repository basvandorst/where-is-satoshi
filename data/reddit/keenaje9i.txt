Not to mention the first guy on the "About Us" page has a link to his twitter where he mentions bitcoin . . .

I, too, am interested in these Bid Coins my grandson told me about at Thanksgiving. More valuable than gold and you just buy them through the computer?

Sure. Here you go: 
Ctrl-v copy that and paste it in your wallet. But do it fast before someone else takes it.

Damn I knew I shouldn't have used my private key as my forum password. All my BTC is gone now.

Falling value? The flash crash is over and BTC is headed back up. Anyone who sold today screwed up immensely. I cashed out half my BTC today and feel like an idiot now!

Yes, indeed, sir, I will buy these from you. And actually, I will buy them from you for $950 each.
Furthermore, I will take all of the risk on myself, so that you needn't worry.
Please send 1/2 of all coins to: 1JdtiLfCJbuup3t6jT3wvJwC5cHaAcss3U
And then I will pay you the FULL amount, after which you will send me the rest.
You see, I will take all the risk. I look forward to receiving the bitcoins so we can proceed further.

You want to remain anonymous but provide a link to your practice? What?

I have two PhDs and BOTH of them are in English.

use gyft and convert it to an amazon or a target gift card. That way you don't have to wait 28 days and go through the whole process of linking your bank account and verifying your identity.

Of course it's not real. Look at the number of pages. It's so patently not true. Not to mention the dead giveaway is the person's request for donations on the same website.
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CREATE GOLD.
GOLD IS WORTHLESS NOW.
plz send gold donations to: goldaddress839
