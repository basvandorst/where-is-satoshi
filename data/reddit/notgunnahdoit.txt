I would be a loyal customer!

I mean, given enough time.. Murphy's Law?
I don't know. I wonder what will happen if the nodes keep decreasing, and the transactions keep increasing, &amp; the blockchain gets larger &amp; larger.
There's no way that BTC will be the pinnacle of digital currency technology for the rest of time, assuming we don't get wiped out by a meteorite, or go to war soon, and kill us all off.  Eventually some aspect of BTC will be improved upon, and it might be specifically regarding an issue that BTC isn't getting past.  You could copy BTC, but add the ability to incorporate some new piece of tech that doesn't exist yet, and make it obsolete.
Nothing lasts forever.

I see one of two retorts..
1, The more challenging, harder to take seriously, "the market is being artificially influenced because BTC represents a threat to the status quo."
2, It's a global currency, and it moves at the speed its owners wish it to, so it's not always so simple to tell what the market influences are (this should eventually make for the most possible amount of stability).
The bottom line that I keep coming back to is that I must maintain the perspective that buying little amounts regularly *is the way to go.*
Every time I think BTC should climb, and it sits, or goes down, I think "BTC sale!", and feel a sense of urgency to get more at these "temporarily low rates". However, I don't need to be right if I buy $50 a week, as opposed to dumping my savings in at this incredible low rate, only to have it drop another $100.
I feel like we should stay on target, which should be regular, easily managed, acquisitions.. and of course, decentralization in all things. Any point of centralization should invoke efforts to replace it. I'm not suggest that I think the market is being artificially manipulated, but I believe that if it ever could be, that it is only a matter of time before it will be.

Agreed.  So when...


...hopefully we can somehow tell, and move to whatever the latest &amp; greatest is.

I don't know why it's not showing the rest of my submission, but basically I tried 6 of the locations listed by LibertyX. No one at any location recognized "Liberty X", or had any idea of what I was talking about. Disappointing.
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:02:33
Can someone tell me why anyone would purchase any other screen/button-less wallet other than the HW1 Wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:02:37
Unfortunately I tried 6 locations, and not a single person at a single one of them had any idea of what I was talking about.
I hope I am the unluckiest guy in the world, and the remaining 2,494 locations are doing a lot of business.

Is there any way to get 10,000 SJCX without having to get BTC first?
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:48:04
It would be except that it's more like me asking why don't people do it with BTC also, since they do do it with non-BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:13:35
That's exactly what I was looking for.  I did not know this.  Thanks!!

I assume there will eventually be a tech issue that seems catastrophic until it doesn't, and expect the exchange rate to plunge, and the discussion of the death of BTC to skyrocket.
The fact that it doesn't die, and the people buying in at the low will make a killing, will be lost on everyone who refuses to consider BTC seriously today.
The other thing to consider is that eventually bitcoin the currency will be bested and abandoned in the face of a crisis rather than improved.
I hope I recognize them both when they happen. I don't foresee the latter anytime soon, but this is tech we're talking about, so it could be almost always 6 months away, and we wouldn't see it.

But wait! There's more!
I wonder about a piece of art that happened to include a paper wallet.
It doesn't need to be so cute, though. I paid for Darryl Strawberry's autograph as a kid. I'd bid on yours on ebay if it came with some bits.
I was always jealous of that spider that one dude tried to exchange to the cell company to pay off his debt. That's perfect.
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:45:21


I am certainly not worried. Didn't mean to give that impression.


I assume that this will mean that BTC will have a long, but finite, run.
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:24:02
It has. As long as it's the world's reserve currency, it doesn't matter. Hypothetically, any fiat currency not based in anything will collapse. If it's the strongest available, or is perceived as the strongest available, or if there are people with guns forcing its acceptance, it won't matter when it collapses.

I can understand why MS wants to get in bed with bitcoin, but not the other way around. People will go through great lengths to protect certain things, and then send money while Skyping on their XBox One. I'm not really criticizing. I love the tech. I'd love to see it added to some decentralized, open source, solutions, and I'd love to see people try to avoid the MS, Google, etc., of the world.

You can buy art with PayPal/eBay, right? You can buy a USB drive. You can buy a composition. You can buy autographs. You can donate, and receive incentives for those donations.
I am not sure there is really anything preventing people except that they believe it's not allowed, and they're not trying.  I get that the dominion doesn't wish us to do these things, but these strategies are used currently to get around selling things we're not permitted to sell, or avoid paying taxes on things, etc., but just not with BTC.  At least, not that I know of.
I'd pay $10 for a Mikermanblah original right now if you threw in 30 mBTC.

It's ridiculous how much the bitcoin community is hell bent on centralizing things.

Certainly 70 btc is a lot of money! It's one thing to deposit say less than 10%, 7 btc, on the exchange. It a bit less comfortable to trust them with 40%, or more.

You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:36:01
I will likely attempt this. Thanks. Still a bit nerve wracking.
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:35:17
In almost every case, I agree with you.
