Jesus, I'm not interested in splitting hairs with you.  There ARE companies trying private blockchains, I just linked two specific examples.  
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:11:32
You can download &amp; run eris's work right now if you'd like
Hyperledger's too
Both are "roll your own blockchain" applications.

Yeah, we've already established that.

If you said, "I'm going to wrap beans and cheese in a tortilla", you're actually saying, "I"m making a burrito".  
And if you say, "I'm going to make my own internet", you're actually saying, "I'm making an intranet".  
Words.  They're hard.  But please try to pay the fuck attention.

Is your corporate intranet not also a LAN?  
Or is your company's LAN not also an intranet?  
One of these must be true if I'm drunk, so which is it?

Nobody thinks their private intranets are going to "compete" with the internet.  That's such a fundamental flaw in your logic that it makes the whole meme utterly stupid.

But you ARE seeing real-world utility for Nasdaq's implementation?  How so?   Have they disclosed to you what they're doing with the blockchain?  How do you know that what NASDAQ is doing has more utility than what Eris is doing?  How do you know bitcoin does it better? Have you compared the implementations?    
You don't think that NASDAQ has a production deployment yet, do you?  Because they don't.  They've stated more than once that it's a proof of concept/prototype.  So how does NASDAQ's POC have more "real world utility" than Eris's?

Yeah, we already talked about that.  Like I said before -- some things definitely are moving toward saas/paas architecture -- but local intranets aren't going anywhere, there is no trend moving away from them.  
If you seriously think something like SalesForce or dropbox is going to replace a corporate network, you don't know anything.

Pedantic drivel.  We all know what means what.  Stop trying to redefine things.  LANs and WANs are both "networks".

I'm a developer/architect for a multi-billion dollar organization with datacenters all over the country.  While we are moving a few things to "the cloud" I can tell you with absolute certainty that our on-prem intranet isn't going anywhere for a very long time.  NObody wants their Intellectual Property in a public, shared cloud.  
e: funny you guys can downvote so hard, but I bet none of you can substantiate the claim.
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:52:35
The burden or proof falls on the one who makes the claim.  
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:52:45
Intranets are also called Local Area Networks, so no I wasn't wrong at all.  
K?  thxbye

FYI, lots of companies have made their own internet.  They're called Local Area Networks (LANs), and they're just like "the internet" but smaller and privately owned.  There's nothing stupid at all about "planning to make your own internet", pretty much every company on earth has their own internet.

It doesn't blow anything up; There are companies trialing private blockchain implementations too.

It's funny how often people in this subreddit interpret the simple truth as an insult.
