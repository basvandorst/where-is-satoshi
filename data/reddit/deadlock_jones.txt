But bitcoin can only stay afloat with mass adaption, which means a stream of new users must start to use it. These users are not going to adapt bitcoin if they think it's very expensive to use. This results in  your existing BTC being worth less.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:16:37
Never ever believe a price prediction (any price prediction which is defined by market). This is absolute garbage. So the guy predicted bitcoin rises in 2017. There are plenty of people out there who did that, probably tens of thousands of people. There are also plenty of analysts who got it wrong, saying it goes down in 2017, but you'll never hear about them, because no one cares. It's 50/50 chance of predicting the direction right, that doesn't mean  he is somehow smarter than any other analyst. Nassim Nicholas Taleb would probably call journalists writing about this analyst's lucky prediction morons.

People are using past data to predict future data, but no one wants to take account more than a year ago, where every bull run ended with bitcoin crashing 85%, last time the downtrend took years.

No. Pretty cringey and stupid technically. It also points out the fact that bitcoin doesn't work without electricity, thus the stupid working phone from the dirt. The fact that it shows 10000 dollars for market price under the amount is also quite dumb. Ps. I own some bitcoin myself, so this isn't a random attack against bitcoin.

Sell some of your gains, at least to make back the money you put into it. Speculate with the remaining profit. This is going to pop soon back to earth, but no one can tell when. You may win or lose, but you'll definitely win from this if you take your initial investment out to keep safe.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:56:44
oh, I am. Just want to make sure people are not putting money into it, which they can't afford to lose. Don't want to hear about bitcoin suicides after this collapses again to under $1000.

I wonder how is it possible, that almost ~2000 year old rare roman coins go for few hundred bucks, but something that has 21 million instances, is very modern, goes for ~$15000 a piece. Also bitcoin is not unique because anyone can create a new cryptocoin, so it's definitely not the underlying tech that gives it value over other cryptos. It's a nice bubble, and that's all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:41
Just wanted to speculate on some crypto. Bitstamp offered it next to litecoin and btc, which were high and I didn't want those. I saw opportunity as it was below a dollar and seemed like something that could fly. I already took out my initial investment and now have free 286 XRP that I'm keeping until I can either buy a house or go bust. XRP does have quite high market cap already, so I don't know how much room there is to rise, but hey, I'd never bet on bitcoin reaching even $5000 and look at it now, youi never know. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. XRP is currently dropping a bit if you want to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:34:21
Yes bitcoin is infinite money machine. Everyone holding one just get richer and richer, there's no way it will ever come back to earth. /s
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:46:39
why not 100k or 1M ? I mean there's no underying value for bitcoin, it can be anything you want it to be.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:09:09
Yes, and then everybody can cash out and be rich at the same time, because bitcoin is a money generator.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:21:00
yes, it's the end of the bubble approaching. It always accelerates the most before the biggest drop. Just a week ago, the price was 9.2k. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:11:36
"kill themselves". What? Is bitcoin going to kill the government? The delusion and lack of understanding of real world is so high within this sub that it hurts. When the economic downturn comes, people start to lose jobs and consume their savings, bitcoin is going to be first asset they cash out of to pay their house and credit loans to banks to keep their living standards. This in turn causes a massive sell off, which results in drop in price and leads to even more massive selloff from speculants who can't take the fall. Bitcoin hasn't seen a single recession yet and one's about to come.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:57:41
I think every trader lets you buy at a set price. I'd seriously be worried if it didn't, imagine accidentally buying way above market average.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:42

Also, no one apart from tech-savvy people actually wants to use something that's so complex to keep secure and use as bitcoin. simplicity ftw. General public will never adapt to this private key / address mess unless there's a service that does it for them. But then what's the point? They no longer control the keys.

Gold is an actual rare metal, used in electronics. Bitcoin is a sort of publicly held virtual linked list with extremely bad performance. (Yes, it might have some value, but its inefficiency causes us to burn more fossil fuels and make environment shittier place overall.)
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:58:26
Alright. To me it just looks like people are buying it in hope to make money, which is not what bitcoin was made for, it's supposed to be currency, not speculative instrument. So it doesn't matter for me if it's $5000, $11000 or $50000, I'm not jumping in, because I don't see the underlying value, as I can pay all my online orders via credit card.

He did only 1/64th of the hash. There are 64 iterations for data smaller than 512bit to get sha256 from it. Over 512 bit you already need 128 iterations. There are machines that to billions of hashes per second. I think the universe will collapse before he manages to mine anything.

Just year ago it was at $700, if you think it's guaranteed to stay at $10000 or over and never go back to $700 you are being delusional and stupid, market is driven by greed and fear and the later never fails to come. Currently we are at the greed phase, just wait until the fear settles in. Bitcoin is not the Mona Lisa painting, which makes it cost millions eventually. You realize there are 21 million of those coins in total available? these are not unique objects even if the supply is limited. The guy did everything right. Getting debt free should be priority one.

wait. Why are you selling your alts for BTC if you already have 1 BTC? It's not a good idea to keep all your eggs in one basket. When BTC starts to rise in price, altcoins are as well, some of them actually might do it much more than BTC does.

Explain how 6 of something digital and reproducible are priced the same as cheapest Van Gogh painting, which is totally unique and no one can ever paint Van Gogh again? 
Bitcoin is not unique, there's a HUGE quantity of them in total. At some point becoming 21 000 000. If you exclude the mysterious price, there's nothing special about owning one, there's 21 000 000 more of those. AND everyone is nowadays creating their own bitcoin implementations, popping up as altcoins, which often technologically surpass bitcoin. Bitcoin has the name, it was the first one, that's why it does well currently, but there are no underlying technological sides which make it better than some altcoins.

Bitcoin is not bubble, but this, what is happening now with the price, is. The fact that people are so eagerly waiting it to reach new levels in price is exactly what bubble means. Most people don't care that bitcoin can buy them pizza or apartment in Dubai, the only thing they are looking forward is counting their money (in dollars) after bitcoin reaches new height.

Apparently Reddit is full of bots that repost very popular posts from past for upvotes. I noticed this happened in AskReddit thread, where most popular answers were copied exactly from the same named thread several years ago. The scary thing was that someone pointed out most answers to those answers were copied as well, by users who only had one post or so. It's like a lot of the posts we spend reading is actually written by copy-bots, from the past...

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:04:14
Well, people are hoping to get more money out of it than they put in, so it's not a storage either. It's more like a speculative instrument or pyramid scheme, which only gets bigger when more people jump in, because the money they earn comes from other people, bitcoin itself is not generating any money. AKA the Bubble. It finally bursts when there are no more people willing jump in. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:52:51
The fact that bitcoin price is rising so much is showing that people are not treating it like a money, but an investment/speculation, which means bitcoin is not really a competitor for a fiat. If you HODL, you are not really adapting bitcoin, you are just speculating over its price (IN FIAT). If you want bitcoin to work, start spending.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:05:04
I dont expect it to get widely adopted, it's too complex to understand. Dont get me wrong, I know computers. I've even implemented SHA256 hashing myself from scratch just to understand how it works and why it's unbreakable. I just think bitcoin can at maximum take place of online payments similar to paypal, not more.

Someone can steal your crypto without leaving a trace instantly. While with other assets, like stocks, your money is locked away. You nor someone else can take it away instantly, even with knife on your throat. Plus often its defended, so your bank or broker wont allow it to be sent to random accounts. And its insured, so if someone hacks the institution, you'll not lose any.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:55:37

_Are you? You realize every Euro you save is also decreasing in value, right? _
Yes, and that's why I'm not hoarding money, but invest everything except a certain amount for unexpected expenses that is slowly losing value on my bank account. Everything else goes to stocks and other assets, increasing my passive income.
@_date: 2019-04-20 20:19:05
As i said, my savings are all in assets, not in money. You made the mistake of not looking up 'value investing'. I didn't sell anything. You are not supposed to sell when the market crash happens,  you hold on to companies that you know perform well long term and dont react to market movements.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:16:00
Someone discovers a serious flaw in the whole concept which can't be fixed, or there is some huge leap in breaking the cryptography on a level comparable to quantum computing. Something better than blockchain might be discovered that replaces bitcoin altogether.

All this while the apartment value will probably be increasing.

You mean buy $NVDA? gotcha.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:00:14
Well it might be. People have paid thousands of dollars for something virtual. The price goes up if the interest grows, but goes down if the interest in it declines. What if people actually think this fad of crypto is over and just lose interest in it (This can still mean blockchain as technology gets implemented somewhere, but not as currency). It's not like average joe started using it, I only know like one person in real life (aside myself) who actually uses cryptocurrency and he has litecoin as far as I know. Most people are afraid of investing and are terrified of losing money -&gt; if they see $19000 turn to $1000 in few years they will not ever want to use crypto as real life paying method, they will prefer bank transactions, where money is safe, insured, and doesn't lose value over night (well it does due to inflation, but it's small loss for safety.).
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:06:31
I don't need to write a new theory to critizise existing one, especially when I'm doing it in reddit.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:09:12
TBH I think the technology behind mineable crypto sucks. Mathematicians and programmers are working hard to optimize all routines and computer algorithms to preserve CPU cycles, time and resources, but this 'payment method' is like the antichrist of optimization, which is on purposely deoptimized web of computers which are doing unnecessary calculations, which no one has any use of. It's not like you couldn't have decentralized cryptocurrency without this useless "mining".
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:26:15
you could simply get a reward for validating transactions without doing trillions of useless calculations.

While I don't disagree what you are saying, by googling I found several threads that also attempt to question the need for mining and the consensus seems to be that it is possible to build a blockchain without one, however there are some issues with it, which mining solves, one of them being double spending. I still think humankind could do better than bitcoin effeciency wise, even if we don't have the solution right now.
 (just information, not attempting to question mining)

Well, it would be stupid to invest in btc right now when its that popular and high. Rather wait for it to drop to $1000 when the next crash happens. Bitcoin is cyclical like stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:31:00
Correction happens if people believe BTC is worth less than its price or they think the price is going down.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:31:43
yes, currently you think so. However when it actually drops the general sentiment changes and greed becomes fear (The two emotions of market). If you see bitcoin lose 80% of it's value in recent month, then you also will feel a little doubt. Anyway, my point is it's much easier in theory than in practice. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:56:36
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:37:04
In addition to that people in general are too dumb/careless/unexperienced/vulnerable to keep their cryptowallets safe, so they'd just end up losing all their lifesavings to hackers or someone just takes it from them by force and there's no one who could protect them about it or return it to them.

That's very risky. Even if bitcoin manages to climb during that time, there's just a risk of losing it to hackers. Even if you come out of this winning, it's a bad financial decision.
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:30:33
it's useful for people, who bought in at $18000, so they can just "tis just a flesh wound" the whole situation.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:09:02
Actually it does, bitcoin price is going up, because people think it is going up - generating more interest in buying it. Supply and demand are the only factors moving the price for bitcoin. So with limited supply and increasing demand the price is going up, with decreasing demand the price is going down. Once people will think the price is going down, the price will actually move down due to people trying to get rid of it. Price targets may influence people's opinion on where the price is headed, thus being self-fulfilling prophecy. It doesn't matter if the price target is actually wrong or right, it matters if its believable. In the long run the price of bitcoin may go up, but current spike in a price is a short-term movement generated by hype. Just six months ago, the price was around $1000 and it's very believable it comes back to those levels at some point in near future.
This has happened so many times in history, can't believe people still haven't learned how something very attractive turns to complete shit in a matter of months while underlying property doesn't change. The price is a matter of belief.

@_date: 2017-10-23 14:34:35
Most likely thing to happen in few weeks to months is that the price collapses to around $1000 which is the previous peak, then the price floats around that point for few years while people who "invested" at $6000 lick their wounds, until something causes the price to go up again triggering more interest and causing another speculative bubble which far exceeds the last one. At least that's how bitcoin history has been so far.
