Very possible.  The future is so uncertain.  If bitcoin threatens the whole system, we can expect the system to defend itself by any means necessary.  This will not be cool at all.

Bitcoin devalues currencies that are backed by violence and coercion.  Its value rises only because of this previous fact.  This is why a 1 million dollar Bitcoin is possible.

Once you start looking at it as the ability for the USD and other fiat currencies to reduce in value, it all makes sense and becomes very realistic.  For the first time, we will finally see the magnitude of theft that has been occurring through inflation.  1 Million, easy peasy.

did you know that bitcoin can make changes to the blockchain to addressthis problem if it ever becomes possible.

true story.

not sure why using your own bank would be an issue.   If you deal with any exchange in Canada your transactions are traceable to you for tax evasion prevention purposes.  Localbitcoin.com is a way around that.

Any business using bitcoin that operates in fiat will dump the coins.   The only good that comes from acceptance is the convenience of not having to dump it yourself  to make the purchase.  Net effect is that bitcoin gains legitimacy and shouldn't impact the amount of coins  being dumped since it was going to happen anyhow.

No kidding.  They are artificially dropping the payouts to make sure everyone is mining hashpoints.

the decentralization of money has profound implications.  it will free all people from abusive governments.  (all governments abuse their financial systems at the expense of their citizens )

if apple didn't change their attitude people would switch to android. 
I mean, more people would switch to android.

I wonder if they accept bitcoin?  ;-)

it would be awesome if you could search a transaction id or crypto conversions like google does for fiat .

they will fail.

I think if bitcoin reaches a price point in the tens of thousands that fiat $100 dollar bills would be treated like pennies are today.  For this to happen, we will likely have to experience a 3rd world war or the economic aftermath of such a war.

cavirtex has bank relationship problems, for some reason , vaultofsatoshi does not.   They are also based in Canada.

I like the way you think.

I went through the same thing I didn't notice any filter changes though.

localbitcoins.com or
 you can buy linden with paypal then buy btc with linden.  not sure if that will work with prepaid cards.  worth a look .

I really don't think we get to decide what bitcoin becomes.  It is largely out of our hands.  I hope for the best and fear the worst because both are possibilities.
