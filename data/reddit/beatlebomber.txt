Because they have a tiny fraction of their traffic...

Coinbase actually keeps it extremely easy to take your money out after you've been banned, which is a huge unnecessary risk to them as a company, as any other financial institution that would place a similar ban on the accounts locks them in full and makes it impossible (e.g.) PayPal.
You frame Coinbase as evil, but abiding by regulation is something they have no choice in, and allowing people to take risky money off the platform is an extreme and generous act they take for their users.
@_date: 2015-12-18 08:33:46
But really what's the fear if they did compete? Bitcoin is deadlocked by its own core devs vs *everyone else*. Having a working group of professionals like IBM &amp; co move things forward actually seems like a dream.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:59:25
Coinbase always allows balance withdrawal in the case of an account ban.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:44:00
And said publications should be responsible and reach out to Coinbase for their side of the story as well.
In all likeliness the user's account was closed for reasons separate to the bug report.
- *why* would they close his account as a result of it? Doesn't make sense. I can't believe no one is questioning this.
- How do we know OP didn't use his account for gambling / dark market / laundering (which is more common than you think)?
- OP lied about not being able to withdraw his bitcoin - the very screenshot he provides shows us that Coinbase did not block his balance. It is also a known policy of Coinbase's to always allow balance withdrawal. So unless they suddenly changed policy, OP just is not telling the truth.
- He was awarded $5k when their only specific award at the time was $100 (according to someone else in this thread). That actually seems generous. $5k is also the specific amount now listed for balance bugs.
- What is the actual evidence that his account was closed as a result of this bug, and not something else? Sorry, but reporting a bug, even a critical one, doesn't give you carte blanche to do whateverthefuck on their platform from that point forward.
For these reasons, I suspect this user was banned not for the bug report, but other things he's not telling us about, and getting up in arms about "treating your whitehats this way" is highly misplaced.
Edit: See Coinbase CEO's response [here](

It won't.
This is old news and the article isn't dated.

It definitely is an unnecessary risk. This is an extreme example, but if you're on the ofac list or something and they let you withdraw, they'd incur enormous fines or be shut down as a company. Them letting people withdraw in cases like that is an extreme risk for them. It doesn't matter if it's "your" money - if a governmental body decides you shouldn't have it, they must restrict access. They put themselves at risk by making it easy to withdraw after banning.


Yeah this isn't what I said. You're assuming that they were banned for the bug report, when it's likely they were banned for unrelated bad account activity.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:50:41
You keep repeating that "the user did no wrongdoing", but you don't actually know this.
It would be more accurate to say that filing the bug report was not wrongdoing, but that OP may have, and probably did, engage in other behavior that is against Coinbase's terms outside of this event, and was banned for that.
And in that respect everything else that followed was normal. Regulations specifically prevent Coinbase from telling its customers why they were banned. You just have to do it, or be shut down as a business.

You shouldn't dismiss XT/101 supporters as trolls, it only fans the flames.

Point taken about the button, good feedback, thanks!
Regarding the rounding, yes, I think it is. A satoshi is one hundredth of a bit, so I assume they're rounding down.
@_date: 2015-05-26 05:13:21
This. I should do this.

Thanks for the thoughts. I think faucets aren't widely used because none of them are really easy. There are plenty of sites promoting the "freeness" of bitcoin, but actually getting some is the part that turns many people away. I think many laypeople first hearing about it are curious, but not to the extent that they're going to enter their bank info somewhere to get some. That's scary. So if there's a faucet that's actually easy to use, it could be different.
I've never heard of a user being frustrated after receiving bitcoin for free. I can imagine how that could happen, I just don't think that it works that way in practicality though. Free money spurs curiosity, which leads people to buy if they turn out to be interested. I actually think "free bitcoin" being about a philosophical freeness would be not what visitors are expecting, and be more confusing.
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:11:21
I think some of those already exist.
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:58:00
Somebody new to bitcoin most likely won't have another wallet to send it to. I see what you mean, but I don't see it being a likely scenario. More likely is the cool factor from having some, enticing them to learn more or acquire more, before trying to send or spend it.
@_date: 2015-05-26 06:00:53
That's how I feel and why I'm looking for suggestions. :)

I think people get excited about owning some small amount, even if they can't do much with it.
Also Coinbase does small amounts off-blockchain, so "dust" transactions aren't something you need to worry about.
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:35:08
In that regard it is no different from any other faucet.

I think even cheaper and cooler might be an easy guide for deploying a node on Google Cloud or AWS.
One advantage is that you'd be able to spin up as many as you wanted to.
I'm currently looking into this. Any tips / knowledge sharing appreciated!

I feel like a business relationship goes both ways. Yeah he bought from them, but they also provided him the ability to buy.
You're not really a "loyal customer" if the moment something goes wrong you flip your fucking shit. That's the exact opposite.

Everyone in this thread is failing to read the actual posts. It's pretty darn simple. Immediately at the time of fork, Core will remain BTC, and the fork will be B2X. After the dust settles, if the fork turns out to have more support, then it will be given the BTC name.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:38:47
He also mentions getting paid a certain dollar amount of BTC in 2009, but Bitcoin didn't even have a market value until 2010 or 2011.
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:39:43
I don't think the gold analogy really fits. Gold has value because it's limited supply, not because of how easily it can be shipped. In fact, if it could be transacted easier, it would probably be worth more due to its increased utility value.
Like gold, bitcoin is already limited in supply. Unlike gold, bitcoin has an *artificial* limit on its usability as a currency (the block size cap). Removing that limit doesn't make it less like gold, it makes it more.
@_date: 2015-09-08 09:44:36
Actually to me that seems more okay, not less. Since bitcoin is something outside of him and his company, his comments are just speculation like any other average joe. I don't see anything wrong with that.
But if he were to start divulging company financials that should be private, laying out internal roadmaps or making unfounded predictions about where bitpay might be, contingent on undefined parameters, etc., then I'd say he's probably saying things he shouldn't.
@_date: 2015-09-07 05:57:07
Bitcion needs a working group.
Web standards don't evolve at the hands of a single set of "core developers" who mostly work for one company, or by the whims of the mostly disinterested users.
They evolve over time from careful consideration by engineers and scientists representing a collection of companies and independent parties, who all work together, providing cases for what changes they think are good and bad, acting as checks and balances to each other.
It's slow, but has worked for a long time now, and it's a good model for bitcoin. The working group should consist of engineers from top companies, the bitcoin foundation, and the education space.
Otherwise we have messed up situations where the technology is purposefully hampered by developers with competing interests.
Not sure how something like this comes about, but I feel that it is badly needed.
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:32:00


I mean he basically said it and you ignored it. Liquid benefits by bitcoin being worse. Custom blockchains don't care about bitcoin at all.

If you really want to store them yourself, just use the coinbase multisig wallet, since it really is the best of all worlds. You keep the keys and Coinbase doesn't have access, but you yourself can conveniently access your money online.
Haters will argue that coinbase is a "bank" and therefore you shouldn't use them to store, but that doesn't apply to the multisig vault. It's legit.

There's nothing that makes exchanges particularly more vulnerable to hacking during a bubble period.
Also if you're actually trading then moving your funds off kind of defeats the purpose.

Hey bud, I mean it's clear you've got some kind of thing going here, like maybe you're posting from the Gemini office and all your buds are upvoting your comments. And like, I get that. It's good you're excited for your company, but there's something you gotta learn. Like 80% of the comments in this subreddit are from fanbois and flamers all duking it out and bragging and calling everything else shit. And you're not really helping. And it's obvious because the ones voicing a dissenting opinion in this thread are quickly getting downvotes, and you are quickly getting upvotes for "correcting" them, even though you're not even funny or witty or particularly accurate. (You just called this guy a zero-dayer and his account is a year old.) So like, by all means be an enthusiastic contributor to the Bitcoin sphere with your new thing, and I hope it goes well for you, but please don't be part of the spam and flame wars. This subreddit was such poison for so long, and I really hate to start seeing it move back in that direction again.
@_date: 2015-10-29 04:50:16
Huh? My account is five months old. These posts are just spam.

Either ETH or Monero evolve to support the features of the other, or another party addressing both perspectives enters.
I don't see why the implementations necessarily need to be interoperable.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:51:21
This is just patently false.

Competition is one of the main premises of capitalism. Do you disagree with it?
Also: those things did give access to the same internet... they were interoperable...
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:50:57
I guess I just disagree. It sounds like you're just being selective of where you think competition should apply, for the sake of propping up Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:47:55
They probably do.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:16:12
Except it's not really a monopoly anymore, because ethereum is in the process of unseating it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:18:41
Why hopefully? Competition is good for users.
