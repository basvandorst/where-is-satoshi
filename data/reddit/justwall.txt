You know what doesn't? IOTA it will replace Bitcoin in a couple years.

I can't wait to have $40 transaction fees and three days for my transaction to get completed. Read the writing on the wall. Bitcoin could be a store of value and nothing more.

 IOTA explained in two minutes. Have a quick watch it makes sense.

Blockchain won't but DAG will.

Iota is far from mooned. $100 easy in a couple years.

Bittrex and Kraken but both currently not taking deposits

I watched the price all day, as soon as it hit a .01 threshold a 100-300 BCC buy was triggered causing the price to sky rocket up to another .01 threshold and repeating. Then all at once it would die off for about 20 mins then launch back up with 50-100 BCC buys simultaneously put up at once. I lost money on it trying to turn my 1 BTC into something bigger. Can't beat those whales....

Nobody can put funds back into the exchanges....once we're able to the supply will far outweigh the demand and you will see an implosion of bch.

As soon as all of us who were smart and took our Bitcoin off the exchanges are able to dump our BCH into the markets, BCH will implode. Kraken and Bittrex right now is basically a tornado of pump and dumpers with a few thousand coins.

You are an idiot.

I got some learning to do...
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:55:57
Exactly... I am new to this and I learned that right away. Thankfully I cut my losses and got out not too bad.

The point being is that the majority of Bitcoin  is being held off the exchanges due to the uncertainty on August 1. It is next to impossible right now to move any BCH back to the exchanges to get rid of. The price is artificially bubbled with a few thousand coins recirculating pumping and dumping the price. The moment all of us waiting on the sidelines are able to move our BCH to the exchanges BCH will plummet into oblivion.

Should we be scared of this?

Sent you 1 XRP.

QuadrigaCx once you are verified will let you dump money onto it. Interac transfer is instant and up to 2k a day.

The only reason it is somewhat relevant is because it has Bitcoin in the name, take out the word Bitcoin and call it bcash and it would crash.

Some day I'll shall own one Bitcoin and it will be glorious!
