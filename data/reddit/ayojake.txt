The average person wouldn't be able to tell though. Same way with shoes unless they are real bad fakes.

I'm not gonna say I lost a ton there but I easily lost probably 2-3 Bitcoin from random bugs on that site. The laggyness of it was awful for me I would click to place a bet sometimes it would be over what I wanted when the lag caught up sometimes it wouldn't even place it. And the tech help on that site was awful

Im really not sure what I can do about it tbh im pretty new to bitcoin. I dont have video like you do. 
Do you know of other sites that are better than cloud bet I wouldnt mind playing but if they are all like cloudbet then I will just move on.

This happened months ago. But the "managers" for lack of a better term would walk up and scan there card and say that there was a problem and would say the bets were being returned even after people have been dealt the hand. I have contacted your support and get the answer of we have reviewed the hand and found there was no problem. Im not sure what else I can do but the way your support handled everything with me left me with a sour taste.

I have had problems with cloudbet as well I just stopped going there. Since it wasn't anything like your 20btc.  So I read your original thread I have had the same thing happen to me multiple times once it happened when I bet 1 btc unlike you I just got pissed and quit didn't think I could do much about it they seem to cancel hands whenever they please and do not give a actual reason as to why it's been cancelled you could have blackjack and it still get cancelled and you get fuck all.

Wait what? Because he's wrong about crypto that makes him a piece of shit? Do you not see all the good he's been trying to do in the world?

It's like a reseller of electronics it's really popular with people who vape because they have a large selection of vaping stuff.
