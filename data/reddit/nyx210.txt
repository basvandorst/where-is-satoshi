Why is this game 22M in size?

Given the hundred of millions of dollars worth in bitcoins that are transacted daily, Bitcoin should definitely be advertised as more than just "magic internet money." 
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:00:58
Because people are irrational and some trading bots may be coded to preemptively sell on any bad news.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:02:01
Well, some of the points that he made were right back then (and still apply today). But he never really justified the $10 price (why not $50 or $100 or $1?). Also, he didn't seem to have studied Bitcoin seriously due to his use of terminology.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:14:50
How convenient.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:58:28
Unfortunately, there are many Bitcoin scams out there. You're really on your own when it comes to due diligence.
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:25:09
By "serious" do you mean that you're willing to spend millions of dollars? Because if not, then bitcoin mining will likely end in disappointment since you're up against 40,000+ machine mining facilities. Although you may profit from mining other altcoins. If you insist, you can head on over to @_date: 2017-03-04 02:00:39
If you want to lend bitcoins, you might as well do it on a site like Poloniex. The system will, at least, try to prevent lenders from losing their money. With P2P bitcoin lending, you're hoping that a stranger will honor an agreement that can't practically be legally enforced.
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:27:16
If you don't have the private key associated with a particular bitcoin address, then you don't have the ability to spend money associated with that address.

kilo- is an SI prefix meaning 10^3. They should've used a different prefix to mean 2^10. The same goes for mega, giga, and tera, etc. Even more confusingly, hard drive manufacturers decided that 1GB = 10^9, not 2^30. So now, operating systems report that a 100 GB hard drive has 107.4 GB of space, no, wait... 93.1 GB of space? Or maybe it will correctly report 100 GB of space and it's up to you to figure out that 100 GB of memory is not equal to 100 GB of disk space?
The point I'm trying to make is that units and prefixes should be consistent with existing standards and definitions to avoid causing unnecessary confusion in the future, especially among less tech-savvy users.
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:02:54
You do realize that we can now identify you on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:37:55
I don't know if Bitcoin supports them, but smart contracts would allow you to do that.
@_date: 2017-01-21 02:38:01
Why not just mine blocks on the testnet?
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:54:26
Unless you're planning on buying drugs or laundering money or something, then it's really not worth it to delete your reddit account...

Maybe it's due to Theresa May's speech on Brexit?

Do you think turning away new users is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:43:38
Basically, [smart contracts]( are the digital equivalents of legal contracts. They enforce agreements which are written in code.
Perhaps you could utilize [multisig transactions]( In order for funds to be sent, both the customer and a timeout script has to sign a transaction. The timeout script will only sign the transaction if the customer pays the correct total and signs by the deadline.
EDIT: Consider payment channels.
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:52:54
I wasn't necessarily referring to the fees but rather transaction speed, especially during times of high volume. A new user probably wouldn't understand how fees work or why transactions take so long to go through even though they're paying the same fee.
btw, If I wanted to support the soft-fork would I have to download the latest version of Core and join a mining pool? I thought mining was pointless for CPUs and GPUs...

Here's [an explanation](
EDIT: Ignore the Mt. Gox nonsense at the end :)
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:41:21
You also have to consider confirmation times and liquidity risk. There's always the chance that the price can suddenly change while you're transferring money across exchanges.
@_date: 2017-01-21 04:27:38
Coinbase's fees are a percentage of your total, so you end up getting penalized for making large purchases.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:31:13
They already [auctioned]( those bitcoins off.
@_date: 2017-01-15 03:53:04
It's a sign that the code shouldn't be trusted with your money.

Mother: "My computer says it has a 64-bit processor. How much is that in Bitcoin dollars?"
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:22:45
His email and pass must've been leaked for some other site and he reused the same email/pass for bittrex. He should probably check [HaveIBeenPwned]( to see if his email shows up. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:14:50
How much money do you have in your bank account?
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:06:04
[For the lazy](
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:58:22
If true, it'll be fixed quite soon.
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:33:46


That's a warning sign right there.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:25:40
Yeah, this reminds me of the whole "1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes" mess that was caused by people that should've known better.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:15:22
Same thing happened to me, except I lent less money to two borrowers (~0.015 BTC). The borrowers both defaulted and I was given an arbitration award. However, I didn't bother going through the legal process since it would likely cost me more.
There are [steps]( you can take to collect money once you're given an arbitration award, but I don't know if it's worth it for 0.05 BTC. Your money's probably gone.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:46:58
It's probably not a big deal. But since part of using Bitcoin is to anonymously send/receive money, linking your reddit username to a specific transaction defeats that purpose.
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:41:44
1. Bank transfers take forever (typically a week or more)
2. Fees are really high, especially if you buy/sell a lot of bitcoins
3. ID verification doesn't work at times
4. Poor customer support
5. They had ETC/ETH issues in the past
People are afraid of another Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:55:32
Bitcoin will be finished if this problem doesn't get fixed.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:36:47
That sounds familiar.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:11:16
Using marketcap is misleading since it includes coins that have been lost and burned.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:54:54
This is a multisig address. Did you contact localbitcoins yet?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:53:51
So you're saying that such "smart contracts" aren't very useful unless the courts recognize the legality of these blockchain records?
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:40:52
Sure. Anyone can modify the protocol, but the question is whether the miners will accept such a modification. If not, then you'd create a fork of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:34:08
It makes more sense if you accept that "code is law." If the blockchain says that I own the widget with serial no. 367422686, then it is so.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:22:39
The exchange could go down or withdrawals could be temporarily disabled.
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:15:54
If they do come back online and allow withdrawals, I'd assume that any coins taken out would be tracked.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:22:02
Whenever I see this guy, he always has this smug look on his face as if he neither comprehends the gravity of losing over ~~850,000~~ 650,000 bitcoins nor the fact that there are so many people that want him dead.
Edit: I forgot that he somehow managed to "find" about 200,000 coins lying around somewhere.  
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:24:08
I've never used localbitcoins before. I would ask if they placed your coins in escrow somehow.
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:48:23
Those that believe in potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, and those that have invested will want it to go up. Any large corporation or government, for which $5 mil is mere change and wants to cripple Bitcoin, would want the price to drop to nothing. Short sellers would want the price to drop as well.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:15:28


If they can't prove that you own crypto, then why would anyone give up that fact?
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:44:03
That wouldn't work with the way Bitcoin is right now because:
1. You'd have to deal with potentially billions of vote transactions.
2. Effectively, only those with millions at their disposal would be making the decisions.
3. The transaction fees would be *huge*.
4. There's a minimum limit for sending Bitcoin dust. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:13:00
Probably due to profit taking.
