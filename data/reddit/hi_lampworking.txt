Holy shit this is a scam! If you want to use your hard drive space to mine/earn money check out Burstcoin, Storj or Maidsafe.
They want $20/year "license fee" for every 300GB that you share, paid upfront in Bitcoin... gee that isn't totally shady or anything.
They say you'll make $7/month for each 300GB plan you purchase but if that was true why wouldn't they just take their fee out of your monthly earnings?

Minergate is garbage - do not use Minergate
You need to stop creating different reddit accounts to promote your crappy youtube videos
