Is it possible to buy more additional btc from coin base if you already have a previous purchase/transfer pending? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:01:32
I just bought my first btc from coin base earlier today. Is there a way to buy more without having to wait for the transfer? Says I can't right now due to first purchase pending.

Thanks for the update. Can I ask what service you use now?

Oh man, what made you decide not to make that initial investment? 5k btc!!

Do you know if there's a way to purchase more btc while a transactions is pending?

How do paper wallets/cold storage work? If the bitcoins are all kept offline, how are they transferred?

Am I supposed to have multiple receiving addresses? Currently have a total of 8 addresses there (5 under Receiving, 3 under Change). Is my Electrum wallet made up of multiple addresses?

I am a complete noob to this as well. I have a blockchain and coinbase address. How do I transfer btc from those wallets to Electrum? Just starting to read up on public and private keys but I'm a bit lost. Do I use the import feature? Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but I really have no idea what I'm doing and could use some guidance before transferring btc offline.

Has your issue been resolved? I'm seeing some posts re their shadiness, but they do seem to have btc prices below that of other exchanges.

You are still the same person at the core, regardless of what your btc wallet looks like. If you're unsure of who that person is exactly, use this financial independence as an opportunity to find yourself. As cliche as it may sound, having a strong foundation of identity/values will allow you to better help and connect with others.
