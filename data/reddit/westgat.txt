dude, governments have not yet collapsed so of course they will still tax us on any type of income we make regardless of the actual currency we use.

This is awesome news!!
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:56:25
gotcha! makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:58:41
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:36:44
How sure are you on this?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:19:57
0.9997 here. Even closer!
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:46:47
Get some asap, then get some when/if it drops.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:13:53
God I hope so!

From what I've learned so far, unless you want to make a serious investment into a mining rig, there's no point. You're unfortunately about 4 years to late on the mining thing. You're better off saving some money and buying some Bitcoin asap.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:09:11
Love it!
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:17:20
Best way to get him started! Once you've tasted it, you can't stop!
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:06:57
I've definitely been doing some research lately and I agree with you, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere IMO. Part of me would like to see a drop before it goes back up for good... just so I could buy a few more BTC without breaking the bank.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:24:41
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:36:42
I am definitely a fan of the bowtie.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:59:22
Let's say fiat looses all it's value in the future... Apart from getting paid for work in bitcoin, with what would new bitcoin users purchase bitcoin? Precious metals?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:23:34
Thank you kind sir! :)
I can now finally say I have one full bitcoin!
westgat OUT!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:44
droppin' hard too...
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:56:49
I second this. Find a seller on localbitcoins who accepts Cash Deposit. This would probably be the easiest/safest method in your situation as long as you don't mind paying a bit more for your BTC. Just make sure you carefully follow the seller's instructions. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:55:59
total? 0,9998
EDIT: forgot to add in that 0.0001 from my original :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:15:26
Seems to me it's more a problem with the app. Maybe it's having difficulty focusing properly?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:46:21
1 Million Dollars
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:52:16
pretty sure there's a subreddit for that... too lazy to check though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:04:10
Try scanning it with a normal QR scanner app and see if that picks it up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:16:28
Good job bruh! :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:43:28
ohhhh... okay, i see what you mean now... my bad!
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:49:09
I'm still kind of new to Bitcoin... but when I was doing this, I tried all sorts of combinations to transfer my funds to one or multiple wallets and it always warned me that there would be a fee... is there a secret to zero-fee transactions?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:59:12
Got mine yesterday!
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:48:45
I'm a n00b, but I'm using [
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:22:27
actually, i was sending from two addresses: one had 0.5 and the other 0.4998 ... or something like that...
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:52:12
Ahhh okay yeah I see what you mean. Guess I'll just hold on to it for now then. It's not like it's a significant amount...
Initially, my goal was to have one paper wallet with exactly 1 BTC on it... but that didn't exactly happen since I hadn't though about the fee... oh well... 0.9997 is fine also.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:36:28
ah! the video that started it all for me :)
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:27:02
Agreed! And to the moon by the end of 2014 :)
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:07:32
I just checked out Trezor... looks awesome!
I kinda wanted to just put it all in one paper wallet and sorta forget about it thinking I'd stop looking at Bitcoin every hour of the day and move on with my life... but I can't stop looking at it and thinking about it all the time :\

@_date: 2013-11-17 15:55:18
Good to know!
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:47:48
lol... yeah I wish! :P
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:07:00
my mom got really confused about 30 seconds into my explanation... i gave up and told her to stock up on silver and gold instead.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:49:37
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:47:20
Let us know how it works out! :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:24:32
I was definitely thinking long term and for sure I won't be able to resist getting some more if there's a downturn.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:41:18
The verification process at the exchange might take a while though...
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:54:49
I tried transferring the whole balance of the address (0.4445) then it said there was a fee, so I changed it to 0.4444 and it worked... but it left 0.0001 in there as if it never took that fee. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:14:23
Do it, before it's too late!
