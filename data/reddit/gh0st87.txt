Are you talking about the pin number or the advanced passphrase encryption?

You can enter the 24 word seed but without providing the passphrase it will just create a new account and new public address with 0 funds. It will only bring back the correct account once you recover it using the 24 word seed + passphrase. So long story short from what I have been reading the passphrase acts like the 25th word of the seed. The pin can be disabled.

Sure, but first..... I must know how many tries I get!?
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:32:09
yes I have.  At first it seemed as if they would guide me to the right person or developer to help out but then I received an email saying I have to try all the combinations that I can think of 1 by 1 but that is just crazy. How am I going to beat a computer that can do what I do within seconds.

man thats bad news.... I can set up john the ripper fairly quick but where would I point him to? I would need access to the wallet.dat file of my trezor if one is even available..... correct?

1 BTC if someone can tell me exactly how long the passphrase I  entered was..... becasue then I can narrow down the combinations by plenty to figure out. If you anyone can help me retrieve the full amount. Then for sure 10% of that will be given to that person, we can set up something so a third party can make sure both ends receive exactly what they ask for.

comes out to about $1,400 usd or about 5.15 btc

thank you.

lol been tryin hipnosis tripnosis and a whole bunch cryptnosis. I do agree though with out brute force this is the only option I'm left it.
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:33:55
10% of 51.47141124 BTC

I have been trying different combination on this but no luck. It can generate all the address's but the one I actually need. Would there be a way to set up a software to brute force the passphrase section? So when it does generate the correct public address, it can somehow warn the user.... maybe highlight or blink? 
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:36:41
Thats the pin.... Not the passphrase length.

ohh man! appreciate the deep clarifcations. I only have access to a intel nuc at the moment 4th generation Intel® Core™ i5-4250U processor. hope it's not that much of a silly approach no matter how I think about it though still beats human + notepad option for now. Rather hog the cpu resources  than brain any day. Will keep you guys updated and hopefully be able to provide the community with a custom version of the recovery tool 
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:13:30
That exactly what needs to be done. Therefore  was wondering if it would be possible to to embed the passphrase bruteforce  in this genius recovery tool.  much props to builder/compiler thank you btw. I was thinking to have one more extra form titled TargetAddress which the user would type the first address that had the actual funds in there. So when or if the correct keys are found,  the whole box would get outlined with some small css like border:2px solid orange??
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:11:26
even with the actual recovery seed that I wrote on the little booklet it came with?
