Do you think they actually hold the coins? It's more likely they convert to USD on the transaction.

I'm so confused. [The website says they only clean.]( For the cleaning/hostess services, touching the girls is STRICTLY forbidden. Cleaning service  is a housecleaning/hostess service only, the girls are NOT sex workers they are simply cleaners with a spicy twist.

Not to mention they put their douche faces on the site. They don't look trustworthy at all. I'm very skeptical of this site.

This is not the right place to talk bad about bitcoins, you will find any negative talk will be meet with a lot of down votes.
Almost everyone here wants to see it succeed, and will only talk positively about bitcoins.

I meant which blog/paper?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:14:41
Ya, but why confuse a potential client? They can mention the 100 other coins that are better to mine for using GPUs but why? The main focus is bitcoins, nothing else.

It's going to be a big problem with eBay too. Many scammers there, and no real protection for buyers using bitcoins.

Nice to know when you bought a big screen TV on blackfriday for 1btc, you suckered the dealer out of 200 bucks today. (Of course the same can be said when the guy who bought a pizza for 10,000 btcs got suckered out of a ten million bucks)

Many of us reading this thought you implemented in game currency (kinda like diablo3 auction house using real money (blizz bucks)) so I would suggest editing your post saying you're actually just calling it BTC and not using real currency.

Well, they do say something about other activities on the site and in their profiles.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:25:57
They most likely convert to the currency from btc to usd at the time of purchase. The site just refers to today rate.

@_date: 2013-11-22 11:03:17
I guess I missed the boat for free bitcoins, but I decided to try your browser anyway. 
Windows 8.1 here. First thing I did was go to Youtube, and immediately found out the tabs popups on the left go under the flash videos. That needs to be addressed.

You are right, but a dollar doesn't increase in value when someone talks about it. 
I realize almost everyone here wants this to happen (let the down votes pour), but there has to be some kind of ethics going on, otherwise it's just like a ponzi scheme when celebrities are in on the "ground floor" of an investment, going into the public to promote how awesome this thing they put in a lot of money into and watch it grow.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:31:53
I have never used bitcoins, but I do believe there is a transaction fee, that is increasing as prices of bitcoins go up (since they charge you some set amount of bitcoins).
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:43:38
Does anyone think the actual posting of these "news" do more harm? I mean on 4chat it kinda stops there, but if a news site like cnn (or whatever popular blog) picks up on something like this, it just multiplies the exposure and breaks more macs (and xboxs).
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:35:47
Nope, I just watched an hour of it, and I can say it was as hilarious as when I saw it years ago. What OP was talking about was just a joke about computers doing mathematical computations.

This news article paints a nice picture of your average bitcoin user, and reddit in general. 






@_date: 2013-12-02 22:58:52
So, where do I start?
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:53:03
A quick google search says somewhere near 20.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:56:09
The only reason people are buying bitcoins is because they heard its a get rich quick scheme. They heard a story about a guy who bought 500 bitcoins in 2009 and is now a millionaire and they want in. Once they realize it's not going to happen, the bubble will burst. 
Right now everyone is hoarding their coins, waiting for it to grow. It's pretty dumb to spend bitcoins when they're increasing in value so quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:37:00
How does this work? Is the transaction fee something that goes to the miners? I see someone said they set their own, 0, does that mean the miners don't earn anything? Is this the main way miners make money?
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:50:37
Correct me if im wrong, but isn't there some kind of law that says celebrities can't promote a stock they're investing into? And if so, how is that not the same for bitcoins? Lets say Snoop bought 1,000 btc a few months ago, and now going around "spreading the good word." 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:55:48
The last page on the Amazon preview. Something about an Update on Nov 19, 2013 how the Chinese have entered the market and the price of bitcoins are skyrocketing. I think this needs another update where the Chinese pulled out and caused a crash.
