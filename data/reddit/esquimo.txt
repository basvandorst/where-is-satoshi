I guess you could add them as watch only addresses on Blockchain.info or Bitcoin QT, I'm not sure how you would bulk import. There must be a command like way on Bitcoin QT.

It will only get worst before it gets better. 
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

This is great, I can now keep GST tax separate, and save some into cold storage.
Quick Books export coming??
Great work guys, keep the features coming!

Just the fact that someone was able to brute force (assuming that is how they did it) already throws me off. 
I like the new service I'm using now, also let's me keep my Litecoins on the same place.

Way back I used Ellectrum but I got tired of dealing with desktop security and paper wallets, then used blockchain.info but too many people had their funds stolen. Coinbase doesn't respond support emails. I now keep it on Coinkite.com as they seem to have good uptime and respond to support requests, but It's pricy.

That's great! I will finally meet you and Anthony in person. 
Is this the meet-up?

I agree, but the fact that the site didn't block the attempts is an indicator of bad design. 
At this point, I'm looking for convenience and support with decent security been done by someone else, I don't mind paying someone to deal with it like I do it with my Fiat.
