Will it cost me money to move my BTC from Coinbase to a paper wallet? 
Thanks so much for helping a newbie out
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:38:38
Hi guys n’ gals. 
I’ve heard that Bitcoin.com is a misleading platform for abc ash. I’m wanting to create a cold storage paper wallet- should I be concerned about the generator on that website? 
Also, is there any way that I can choose to wait for a transaction through Coinbase?.... transferring my money will cause me to loose a lot of my value...(not rich :()

What is this? Love the animation

So owning bitcoin really *does* make me holier-than-thou! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:33
Shhhhh shhhhh, now. Just relax. This is right. This is good. Satoshi has you, now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:54
Yes. And if bankers have placed shorts on bitcoin, they’ll receive a payout. In my opinion though, there are a LOT of people waiting for bitcoin to fall in order to buy, so I’m not too concerned. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:42:48
Bitcoin is already volatile without them. What I want to see happen is them pull for shorts, causing a panic buy, leading further pump and dumps only to feed a growing cycle. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:00
Bitcoin is uncharted territory. No one, absolutely no one, can tell you what is about to happen. I heard an estimate that it could fall to 8-5k. I think that is definitely a possibility. 
But its also a possibility that this bull run keeps going and we hit 25k. Its possible any dip is bought faster than the sell, since this market doesn't sleep. That's buying into the hysteria and you should only believe that if you believe in this technology.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:14
Correct. What is going to be interesting is to see how many people buy the massive dip that WILL be happening.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:55:15
I hope one of these hackers turns out to be robin hood and spreads the wealth. Still feel bad about the people loosing their money
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:17
Right. If they cause the rise in price, they could cause a fall in price by selling, making them double dip in profits from sells and shorts. 
Or at least that’s what I’ve heard speculated. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:48
You answered your own question. Bitcoin is coming into maturity. 
Or.... we’re witnessing a dump from whales looking to capitalize on selling and shorting the market when futures arrive.

GDAX wants my license and photograph.... is this a trustful service? Coinbase wants it too... I’d hate to have that info compromised, even if my bitcoin is safe when I move it 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:34:01
I’m frustrated I don’t have wealth to put into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:23:00
1 bitcoin is only a number. If global adoption happens people will be trading decimals. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:22
To open a channel you have to pay the on-chain fee. The natural progression will be channels with multiple parties. Bigger channels will require more capital to support volume, leading to big players like banks facilitating transactions between parties by providing the cost up front and making money from their own fees, right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:45
It took a couple days of us prancing under 10K before we hit it, I expect the same thing to happen to 15K. What I’m going to be surprised by is if we hit 14K, and it looks possible.

Listen you little tech lover, we’ve already decided that coal is the future, and solar is dead, you hear?! Now stop killing to world using coal power to mess with our hedge funds!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:35
I dunno about other people, but I’m probably getting some cash for Christmas and I’m putting it right into BTC. So yes, I think 15K in ‘17 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:53:20
I’m trying to learn more and more about this and I promise I’m not a shill. 
If LN nodes promote small transaction fees, wouldn’t centralized nodes attract users? So suddenly we have a middleman with the needed capital facilitating payment between multiple users... so banks. 
Why would your average user use the BTC blockchain anymore instead of the centralized hubs? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:35:49
There is value, for me, to be paid in bitcoin for services and to freely transfer that bitcoin to anyone. IMO, that makes this not a Ponzi scheme any more than the US dollar is a Ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:31:35
I don’t know if Breadwallet allows for it, but some wallets will let you choose to wait to transfer when fees are low, like Mycelium 
People like me with Coinbase don’t have a choice 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:29:02
If my nicehash is linked to a wallet on exchange, is that wallet at risk? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:32:54
Oh? I thought it was only free to GDAX. Do I have to go through their ID system to send to a GDAX wallet, or is that only if I want to buy/sell on the exchange? 
Thanks so much for this info

It’s important to consider how traceable bitcoin is when considering illicit uses. Once bitcoin is moved, everyone can see where it goes. It’s much, MUCH easier to track than paper dollars.

If you’re convinced it’s a bubble and will hurt if it pops, then sell. 
The best way to feel good about bitcoin is to believe in the technology and that it’s meant for more than speculative bubbles. It’s meant to involve everyone in the economy, and strengthen the world together. 
If you think something else is destined to happen, and have good reason to believe that, then isn’t it silly to allow yourself to be involved in a self fulfilling prophecy?

I hate being employed. Got a realtor’s license and sold a couple houses, but hated it. I’ve been living off my funds for a while before getting a min wage job, slowly getting more and more depressed..
And then Bitcoin comes along and gives me something to believe in. Feels like I really screwed the pooch.

I see, I misunderstood as well. I think blockchain still has some evolving to do, and we may use one fork as a store of wealth and the other as a means of an exchange. Perhaps as a hybrid. I won’t lie, it’s speculative burst has given me a massive amount of optimism, and I should disclaim that I have not to this point invested as a living. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:45
Lmao what a joke. I’ve never seen someone snort Cocaine with a bitcoin.

Another newb here. Are these third parties just fronting the money for the transaction at a premium? How does this decentralize BTC? 
Is it because we have no way of knowing if the transaction has even been mined? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:43:37
I appreciate it, pardon the melodramatic tone! Early 20s. 
It’s funny, I hear a lot about how defeatist millennials are. I think we’ve needed something like bitcoin for a long, long time now. 
I fully know that right now I’m experiencing part of a mass hysteria with BTC having skyrocketed, but it’s so much better than the time I’ve been spending otherwise. 
Are you in a similar boat? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:13:45
You. I like you.

I’ve always imagined I’d make a great rich person. I just play video games and cook food. Add an infinity pool and endless time to that equation and you’ll never hear from me again ��

This is me, I hate that I became unemployed this year, if I were making money I’d be putting it right into BTC. The future looks so bright and I don’t want to be left behind.

Let’s say the 1% continue to amass BTC like they do current wealth. Could the other 99% just agree on value division?

Energy consumption crypto will create a feedback loop in emerging solar industries. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:56:24
What are the extra steps? Considering a bank is not involved when I send money, I’d expect for it to be less steps. 
People buying for gains should, at some point, realize that they can buy things straight from the stocks they purchased. That’s the trend to look for, when selling becomes rarer. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:32:50
The cost of solar is exponentially decreasing. The same cannot be said about cheap coal. 
I am especially interested in the development of solar farms in Africa, a country which will benefit greatly from both solar farms and crypto currency.

I’m attempting to learn more about bitcoin. Are these percentages hash power/miners on Segwit2x chain? 
Does more a more centralized blockchain mean only some people can “mine”? 
In what way is 70-80 percent significant to adoption? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:50:12
If your question is directed towards day traders, then yes, I agree short term with your concerns. I’m a long term optimist. 
Bitcoin, or more precisely the blockchain, is the only thing I can think of that could support 6-7 billion people investing in it, while being able to keep securely in their possession. 
It’s gold you can carry around and still not have stolen, barring torture. Add in the possibility of freely trading that gold, for a fraction of its cost, and it makes more sense to me than a mineral.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:25:08
It’s even better when the store will just accept the silver instead of the dollar. That’s the future I hope to see, although I admittedly don’t know how volatility will scale with BTC. Part of me doesn’t think it’ll be a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:45:43
So... doesn’t this change with Crypto? They can’t seize that asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:35:24
Beginner here, 
When looking at these graphs of bitcoins value, are these representations of how many “dollars” bitcoin is worth on the stock exchange? Is it bitcoin = dollar and bitcoin = dollar on stock exchange, or are those two the same? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:22
This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:54:20
I believe innovation in the space will address this, and if the value of bitcoin continues to outpace transaction fees, I hope to see a day when they are accepted as norm and a minimal issue considering the benefits of a decentralized currency. 
Yes, as long as fiat remains cheaper for tx and convenience, bitcoin will rely on its value being a store of wealth. 
But it is a store of wealth anyone can use, and that has interesting consequences for speculative growth.

An exchange break in like MtGox. Something with headlines saying “bitcoins stolen”.

There are two major tipping points that I see- Amazon accepting bitcoin, or a more gradual progression of third world countries adopting bitcoin and trading for basic goods and services. 
I’ve thought about going out to offer lawn care for bitcoin. Eventually I hope to see people paid for online interaction, upvotes becoming small BTC transactions, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:38:19
I put the last amount of money I have into BTC. It’s not enough to day trade with. I can only hope that Bitcoins technology succeeds and the world enters a global economy. 
In a way, it’s given me this thrilling sense of optimism. I have nothing to loose, because I gave up a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:10:12
Well, we already worship the dollar, so...
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:38:07
I’m sure I’m not the first to say this and will not be the last. The talk of bubbles is not really the point. It’s always a possibility, but at the end of the day either you believe in the technology or you don’t. 
Put money into it that you fully expect to loose, but also fully expect to win from and be a part of. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:07:52
The Universal Basic Income podcast discusses case profiles as being the most efficient way of de-mything poverty and “free money”. The effect that having a monthly cushion has on people is most impactful when people see that, no, they don’t spend it on drugs and money. 
I believe their most recent podcast was centered around this concept, you may want to give it a listen! Good on ya for believe that we all get a little stronger together, 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:24:55
I only had enough to put $40 in bitcoin around $7000.... should I even be worried? I feel so awful that I didn’t buy in sooner, I could have really gotten out of a hard time in life. 
Do people see holding even this amount as being useful, is there that kind of potential? Maybe I’ll be able to buy a used car if things turn out really well ��

As a trader, how would you describe Bitcoins value? Have you seen any thing traded in the past offer something like what bitcoin offers? I’m very new to this and would love all perspectives,

I have faith in emergent technology to adapt to needs. It’s not used as a currency, currently, but I see that changing in the future. 
Even if it doesn’t, I see it being a better store of wealth than gold. 
If I’m wrong on both of these ideas, then I’ll turn out to be a bad investor.

Bitcoin is created when miners secure the blockchain. 
Bitcoin has value because bitcoin is secure. 
Bitcoin has explosive value right now because of speculation and adoption. What kind of correction comes next is speculation.

I’m amazed at the $500 drop earlier. It was a flash in time and then price went back up. 
People are buying any dip, even at this price range. This is what happens when anyone, anywhere can participate in this experiment. 
I’m starting to question just how high this bull market goes, and when it does correct, I’m not so sure it’ll even be for long. This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. 
Or it’ll bust and be in history books in 10 years. (But I’m a sucker for fairy tales.)

The oil industry was boosted off of the automobile economy. 
Sure, I’m drawing parallels. But if I’m to believe in exponential solar, then it’s a fair parallel to draw.
