They've been testing blockchain for 10 years, can you explain why hes afraid of BTC? BTC is pretty primitiv and shows no valid competition against other blockchains. If you think about it, you use USD/EURO/Whatever fiat to turn into cryptos. You'll forever use their services to enter the crypto markets, they've won no matter what.

So why did he buy bitcoin when he can pump &amp; dump whatever the fk he wants? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:10:00
Oh yeah sure, ignore a man who has over 30 years of financial and economic experience. You must be smarter than him :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:36:53
As a bank, with close to unlimited capital, I won't be afraid because i've already researched the subject for 10 years and have been working on getting the same benefits... time will tell I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:41:42
Sure, pal. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:08:26
Well I don't think they're afraid of cryptocurrencies. If they are to take over, they have to be centralised. The positive effects of cryptos, is because of the blockchain technology. BC is 'just' back-end systems working. They've been testing this technology for a long time and the whole monetery infrastructure has to change, before we can feel the positive effects of BC. This will take a long time and will result in an overall improvement of our monetary systems, I don't believe there will be a difference, like there is now. My 2c :) 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:40:45
Well 99% of all blockchain projects don't even need a token/coin/any currency connected to it. You must be smarter then :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:41:12
Yes 
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:07:45
Very little progress considering this bs has been around for 10 years. Tech has to adopt faster, if it is as good as this delusional community says it is. 
Since the price of btc has been manipulated hard, something tells me it's more about how the price of btc progresses and not the other factors you mentioned. 'Security', 'lightning network', lol thanks for the laugh. 
Edit: stores and markets that accepts btc doesn't even get paid in btc, because they don't like unstable prices, which shows just how great this 'currency' is hahah. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:50:32
Sure buddy, another '2 years'. Lightning network getting close, amirite?

Oh so crypto can't finance wars? Come on man, wars are human nature, not a money/currencies' fault and i'm not gonna watch a random youtube video about rothschild and money. 
I'm not even in cryptocurrencies, because the invested capital in the market consists of 99% amateur money and really, really risky. A rational investor won't risk his money (at least not yet). This doesn't mean I don't know what they are. I've read everything I can get my hands on regarding cryptos.   
I'm not saying debt created our world, i'm saying debt helped accelerate the progress, which it did, by a lot and will continue to do so. I'd be more worried if there wasn't any debt in the world, means no progress is happening. 
EDIT: I'm really trying to get good answers out of you guys, can someone with a more detailed understanding of the economical perspective in crypto, answer some of my questions? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:46:40
Thank you for taking the time to answer my question. So by reading I can understand that you really like blockchain and can see the benefit for it in our society. I completely agree with you. But where does this leave BTC as a currency? I can't see any needs for it, once blockchain takes off. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:20:54
Thanks for the tip! I'm really interested in having a dialogue about this subject :) 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:30:39
Well put, my worries exactly. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:19:26
Amateur money = no institutional money. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:57:54
So our money destroyed the planet? I'd say our presence did. Crypto or not, the process of not giving a fuck about the environment was/is unavoidable. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:51:50
Ok, so you want to make debt unavailable for the entire world, because USA is acting in an unethical and dishonest way? Debt fuels growth. 
I don't understand the hatred against all bankers, you're assuming they're evil people only living on this earth to bring you down financially. 
Debt has done more good than bad. Look around, the world is created by debt, medicine, school, your household, food etc. Why would a country ever borrow more than it could repay? And how do you know USA can't repay it's debts? Were you present when the deal(s) were made? Do you know the details of the lending contracts?
I've talked to so many BTC enthusiasts, you'll keep going back to the 'debt is evil', 'central banks are the reason evil exists in this world', 'rothschild controls over $500 trillion worth of assests and they also did 9/11' arguments. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:30:01
I don't know why I get downvoted, this is a really simple question and the OP didn't make it clear why the financial system is bad. Saying 'debt is bad' doesn't make sense, this means that you don't know how money and the economy works. 
Why is debt bad? 
And can you point out what's NOT financed by debt? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:21:46
Yeah I understand the benefits of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:17:15
Alright, but why and how? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:56:03
Yes, but how can crypto fix this problem? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:42:49
It is decentralized because it's useless... for now. BTC will get regulated as fuck, if you want it to make the impact you're hoping for.  
The wars you're talking about were pretty much unavoidable. You're talking about the monetary system as if it were created by the devil. You only point out the bad stuff without even looking at what debt and money has done for us. 
My question is why should BTC ever replace 'fiat currency'?
Answer while keeping these notes in mind: 
*Blockchain is responsible for the lucrative transaction speed, fee etc. 
*It will get regulated. 
*Banks have been testing blockchain for years. 
That's all I can think about right now, re-read my comments and you'll understand my doubts/fears. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:23:04
I'm Iraqi, trust me I don't live in a bubble of propaganda. 
I hear you, but I think all money is evil because of human nature. Doesn't matter if it's fiat, crypto or even fucking alien feces. Greed is in our nature. 
I'd love a world without wars and the examples you gave. I just don't think BTC will replace fiat currency and shoot us into a bubble of love, harmony and ecstasy. 
I hope i'm wrong, but I think blockchain will continue to grow and change our world for the better, I just don't see a crypto currency doing it. 
This case is simple, you're talking about freedom and what-not, fact is your life is what you make it yourself. No one can force you to work, but if you want to eat, it's a good idea to have money. If you had a good job, education and whatever, you won't say these things. Debt got me a good education, which led to a good life. I can do what I want. I am completely free. Guess what? I'm not the only one on earth with this feeling, there's billions of us. We're free.  
If you don't want to work to earn money, you can just quit and go off grid. Thanks for the discussion. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:15:51
But there's already a top 1% in the BTC world. Whom got rich, because of capitalism. All money is evil with your logic. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:55:59
So what's wrong with the financial system? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:29:59
Lol when tf were you born? This community is a laughing stock 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:49:48
Market liquidity allows any given market to exchange it's assets at stable prices (btc prices are in no way stable). The most liquid asset is cash. There is no cash in crypto market. And trading only 'gives liquidity' when people sell their assets, so according to you; it's good when people speculate in btc prices, because when they sell, their assets will be liquid. Why do you like stable prices? You bought this shit to sell it for a higher price in the future. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:02:43
Thanks for the laugh, but you still use USD to pay for food and services. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:43:27
A good store of value doesn't lose over 80% of it's value in a very short time.
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:38:48
Yeah tell that to pension funds 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:38:21
Hahahhahha 'store of value', proceeds to lose over 80% of it's so called 'value'. Never witnessed such a delusional people. At this point, you're acting like mlm people trying to explain how their 'business' is not a pyramid scheme. I thought btc was a currency, that's supposed to change the world? You guys won't even use it. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:40:25
Yes. I've been comparing whatever this community has said, with what's actually happening in the real world since 2012. It's just hot air. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:18:38
Soooo fiat -&gt; crypto -&gt; fiat... Totally necessary and meaningful extra step.  
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:40:22
In other words: no one knows what it is, but we're gonna buy it using USD and hopefully sell it at a higher price in the future. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:35:43
It's been around for over 10 years without any significant impact. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:26:03
Why are you comparing a self proclaimed currency to the internet? Bitcoin hasn't done shit for 'value flow'. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:05:31
You can't even go to your local supermarket to purchase goods with Bitcoin and it's been around for over 10 years!! You guys exchange USD for Btc only to hide it under your pillow lol. Compile a list of positive things BTC has done, please. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:08:52
Volatility is not good, if you're looking to store value. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:41:55
Do you even know what liquidity means? 
@_date: 2019-02-28 12:40:29
Speculating is holding? Lol. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:13:13
Hello how can I join this MLM  
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:29:54
What a moron 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:53:06
Well you can kiss that value goodbye! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:04:22
So just use fiat then? 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:47:01
Cryptos are like warm piss in the winter. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:47:18
The stupidity.....
