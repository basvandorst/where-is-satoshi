Interesting. I learn something new each day.

Hi, sorry I'm late to this discussion:
So I have 2 incoming connections, and I just finished the sync process last night. Followed all the instructions of setting up a static IP for my node and opening port 8333. I checked bitnodes.io and my IP is *not* showing up, even though I've had Core running for two days.
Will I get more incoming eventually? I know it's a "trustless" network, but is there preference given to nodes that have been online longer?
Thank you!
EDIT: Outgoing connections are at 8, for a total of 10 connections.

I recommend checking out r/BitcoinBeginners. There's lots of helpful and friendly people over there.
Also there's lots of great information in the sidebar. Try spending some time looking that stuff over. If you don't put any effort into researching your question for yourself, many people aren't really going to want to help you.
Good luck.

So basically, you should only deposit to a paper wallet once? Not make multiple deposits to it and then sweep it clean in one transaction when withdrawing?

I didn't think proper nouns were allowed? Perhaps I've been playing wrong my whole life!
