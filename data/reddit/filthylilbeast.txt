Everyone starts somewhere. Some have a knack for it or they don’t. Only one way to know though. Dooo it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:45:45
How can it be verified that they are all 100% identical? Also, why so much emphasis on the value rising ? Such aggressive gains can only bring identical falls.  We see that now. With one BC being worth ..what ? $11,000 now or something , it makes it nearly impossible for there to be a level playing field for someone trying to get in now. All they are doing by getting in now is growing the pot for the whales. Sure , it increases the network and such but until there is real world Application and people ACTUALLY spend their BC’s it’s all just everyone buying a bunch of bonds and waiting for them to gain value ..hoarding them.  That doesn’t help increase the stability and making it a viable and everyday currency of choice.

Ok but none of these nodes are regulated. It’s a free for all. I’m not exactly clear on how mining and nodes work but it just seems really inefficient. Not even to mention the resources it consumes.

@_date: 2017-12-02 19:28:58
Tomato, tomatoe. Uninformed nonsense? Why? Because it questions this Ponzi scheme? God forbid anyone offer a counter point or point out the risk and flaws of this ponzi.  Call me a troll all u want. I’m speculating the same as people speculating that BC is legit and will keep increasing and drawing more suckers...I mean PEOPLE in. So..yeah. 51% Block isn’t a meaningless term. You’ve never heard about the potential scenario of an attack on the 51%? You seem so informed yet u ignore that ? Smart. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:01:44
Lol. So how long did that .1 take? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:02:25
You explain it well but here is still trust involved. It may not be from traditional sources and bodies but even a block chain and those involved in maintaining it is a form of trust. Imagine all the meticulous data and processes and info involved in trying to track down a BC transaction when it involves millions of 1’s and 0’s spread out over thousands of computers in different locations? Seems like an impossible task for the average person to comprehend and fully grasp. So although it’s public , it’s still not very practical 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:57:54
That really doesn’t explain why it has value though.

A Ponzi scheme -is an investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.

If u don’t think BTC can be manipulated and everyone is in it for the greater good. You’re more naive than ..well you’re just dumb.

I see. I guess it’s a lot of work to do that for small gains. Well I’m using the word “ work “ loosely seeing as it’s just pushing button. Lol. Time is $ though. I guess it’s once u get a system though it could be worth it. Seems stressful though ..watching a screen all day.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:02:12
Mm hmmm. Keep telling yourself That. Nobody wants to be wrong about their investment. Meanwhile , the rich get richer. Seems the only ones being hostile are the people with vested stakes who wanna see their ponzi pot keep growing.

More like Asian Monopoly currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:53:18
You explained it well. I still don’t see enough real work application.  The main goal is still to turn it into liquid cash..growing “ the pot” until it’s large enough to cash out..otherwise what’s the point ? That said , those who have been in it longer will automatically benefit more depending in how many new recruits come aboard. That’s fine but that’s literally the definition of a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:31:20
I told ppl this but u explained it way better. It’s almost obvious to be honest. Can u blame them? Like u said, no regulation. Who is to stop them? Why wouldn’t they do it is the real question. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:01:27

Nobody cares. Just buy and mine more BC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:30:26
Ok I see.  That kinda answers a question I posted a few minutes ago. So can u withdraw from that amount without cashing it all out? Like a dividend? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:41:52
Likely you’ve been in it awhile I take it?

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:09:07
Don’t u see? The bigger something gets the harder it is to control? That’s a basic rule of anything really. They are counting on that.  Big = vulnerable

What BC millionaires? U know any personally? Or are u just speculating? Seems like it’s the way of the  BC’er ..Speculating. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:32:53
Oh cmon. It’s not THAT simple lol. Maybe once youre plugged in and set up and are verified sure. Not right away though. It’s a process ..With PayPal you can send money by text.

@_date: 2017-12-02 03:39:24

I find it hard to believe a larger mining pool could consistently lose to a smaller. Plenty of experts have stated that mining is almost a futile enterprise at this point unless you invest thousands and thousands of dollars into it which the OP isn’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:26:03
That’s one of the points, yes. It’s trying to achieve something that’s moot

@_date: 2017-12-02 05:15:36
I’ve seen that stuff. Overload of info is another tactic to confuse ppl. Who is actually gonna read a bunch of BC transaction code? The average person can’t even comprehend how to set Bluetooth let alone understand al this abstract jargon. Why do all BC’ers sound like cult members? No offense 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:09:35
Right. That’s good  anything else? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:23:24
I think u can figure that out seeing as I posted it in the BC forum 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:04:15
I appreciate the well articulated and thought out response. At the end of the day it’s still 1’s and 0’s that can be manipulated.  One of the basic rules of existence is that the bigger an entity gets the less control you have over it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:52:34
It’s like a cult. I swear. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:00:34
You’ll have to pay ..what? Like 30% in taxes tho, right? Or is that just for a withdrawal and not a loan on a 401k? If not , $32 a month is pretty good considering the $ u could possibly make in BTC. You likely could pay that off with  % of the BTC money u make every month, assuming it rises.

@_date: 2017-12-02 14:57:15
Nobody said that but people using that reason as BC being the currency of the future seem a bit paranoid and naive at the very least.  It’s about getting rich. Another quick get $ method. Let’s not pretend otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:49:57
It’s like the more ppl put $ into it and wait for it to grow , it increases the value of the BC’s of people that have already had them ..it’s a cycle. This group waits 10 years and cashes out, the next group edits another 10 and so on and so forth. All the while having no real world application. It’s all pivoted in new people growing the pot. Why do u think it has such aggressive gains and losses day to day? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:27:44
U have BC’s. Cash them in u fucker. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:04:31
You’re twisting what I’m saying. U focus on that one term yet ignore the main point of what I’m saying. The point is if u try to mine and your block is rejected in favor of a bigger more established block..u lose. Is that so unreasonable a conclusion to come to?

@_date: 2017-12-02 07:13:17
Assuming everyone adopted that attitude. As long as  the gains Look like they do , it will attract the “ flip” element. Also the resources it takes to keep the block chain is very disturbing.  I guess Solar power is the future but even that requires resources. All to sustain the crypto currency world? AND that’s just BC..inevitably new forms of CC will gain as much popularity which means more block chains more power to run them etc.  I still think centralized super computers that U log into remotely is a more practical resource efficient way. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:12:30
YESSS!!  ���������� u sir for posting this. I brought up some of those exact points and got attacked. People think BC is immune from HUMAN NATURE and our tendency for manipulation. They seem to think that BC is is the only currency in the world that can’t be manipulated lol. So delusional. Also I brought up the energy it takes to sustain it long term.  Excellent post sir. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:22:38
Of course they are passionate. They wanna recruit as many ppl as possible to build the pot and cash out. Otherwise it’s all been a waste of time and resources.

@_date: 2017-12-08 00:43:19
It’s just human nature. That’s all I can say. I’m not gonna label it a bubble or whatever but  it’s only a matter of time. Didn’t an exchange just get hit for $60 or something ? It’ll happen again. I don’t think small fish have anything to worry about but then again it does affect everyone involved I suppose. Don’t ask me how it’s done. I don’t understand it anymore than the average person. I just think it’s silly to assume it’s immune from those elements   Especially with no regulation.

That’s just it. They don’t want regulation.BTC’ers seem to make it a point of pride. Ppl keep praising anonymity but seems to me the only ppl that benefits are the ones doing shady business. They have no issue putting their personal info on social media but they make a big deal over anonymous currency? Which isn’t even anonymous anyways since they have to verify their identity to use exchanges. It’s a breeding ground RIPE for whales to take it over. Smh

Wait 10 years and pray that the majority of people HODL ( hold onto it..don’t ask me why it’s spelled that way ) and don’t cash out causing the whole thing to crash. It’s really that simple.  There’s no secret technique to it all. It’s a waiting game. Unless you already were in the game early on, trying to be a day trader is with CC is useless. I’m not an expert but I’ve  learned a lot interacting with diff people. Some hostile others genuinely helpful. If u don’t mind waiting and it’s not hurting u financially I say go for it. What do u have to lose? Don’t think of it as a quick get rich system, because it’s not.

@_date: 2017-12-23 17:02:15
It’s already happening. Smh. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:24:15
That’s the kinda thing that worries me. Most people aren’t tech savvy enough to even use P2P sharing. Now you wanna pump massive amounts of money into something u don’t even understand fully? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:07:17
Ok but we are way past that now. Let’s not pretend otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:37:06
Money that depends on new followers go join? Yep. That’s a cult. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:33:19
Every single market in the world can be manipulated. This is no different. Regardless of what ppl tell u about the block chain being hack proof blah blah. People have been cheating since the beginning of time and they will continue to. There’s always a way. I don’t have any advice about it , just saying. It’s too much money on the table for it not to attract that kind of element. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:36

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:10:54
I’m not 100% on this though but this is what it sounds like.

How can u make $ in such a short amount of time? Like what kinda margin? For example at 10:45 it’s worth $500... by 11:00 how much profit could be made in that short a time? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:18:58
Not sure If that’s. Good thing though. Decentralization. Other than anonymity, which idk why people are so concerned with that if they are doing legit things , there’s no advantage to it.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:00:21

@_date: 2017-12-07 05:51:31
Yeah. Maybe if u just sold off small %’s and just keep flipping it over and over. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:24:47
Why? It seems excessive. A dozen super computers could do the same as 100 average computers. Maybe it’s a security issue? Ok but what’s the difference? A Network is a Network. Whether it’s from a bunch of Computers spread out over a state or a few in a centralized location. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:52:43
Yeah. That’s not even remotely the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:24:48
Well that’s more cultural than anything.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:26
Yeah. Except that’s exactly what’s happening right now.  Word of mouth has grown it like a beast overnight. I see posts from 13 year olds thinking they are gonna become millionaires overnight. God save them all. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:26:58
Instead of all the nodes and miners just make super computers that everyone can log into. Seems way more efficient. Or maybe it’s because it’s s scam so having it spread out keeps ppl from catching on to the scam? Hmmm
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:01:48

The only reason ppl are blindly pouring money into this without even fully understanding it is because it’s marketed as some sort of “ anarchist “ economy currency.  That appeals to a lot of ppl these days. They here these dazzling tales of people turning $100 investments into thousands of dollars. What they don’t tell u is that it’s dependent solely on new people putting money into the pot. U supposedly have people maintaining this block chain that you HAVE to have to keep this going. What If a bunch of these guardians of the chain decide to cut off their computers? What’s to stop them? A team of hackers decide to corrupt the data by adding viruses the system? There aren’t enough safe guards in place.  Solely trusting ppl will “ do the right thing “ isn’t enough. There are no penalties or consequences other than not making BC as valuable to everyone and themselves.  It’s too vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:04:09

Right or wrong we are WAAAY past that at this point. Thinking otherwise is delusional. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:40:33
Hmmm.  That’s a strong explanation. If a team of people worked together though , it seems possible to create some kind of shift in their favor. I just can see how someone could accurately review all that data in all those networks without some kind of discrepancy. There must be some sort of human error element to all this.  What if some kinda virus infected the chain? That could easily spread and corrupt the system. Even if it changed 1 number it could cause catastrophic damage. No digital entity is 100% safe from a situation like that.  If something can be programmed it can be tampered with. Even with the 51% failsafe
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:59:48
That’s one of the things I don’t get about BC. What if your computer hard drive crashes or u lose your computer. There’s no account # to recover it? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:31:06

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:48:41
Seriously? You’re going with THAT? The irony of someone on a social networking site , connected to a public utility on the World Wide Web , talking  about anonymity is amusing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:03:02
That’s fine but let’s not pretend it’s something more than that.  People are talking about it being a practical everyday “currency of da future” until u can buy a loaf of bread with it , it’s all speculative.

@_date: 2017-12-02 07:48:17
Why not just keep creating more efficient software to do the mathematics needed for the block chain? Instead of just adding more and more and more computers. Seems kinda redundant. Yes. Centralized super computers seem more efficient. We use servers for everything else already.  If hackers can penetrate military data they can compromise a block chain. It’s only a matter of time. The bigger it grows the easier it will become. The money will be long  gone before someone can read the code  of thousands of interlocked computers.  Long gone.

I’m seeing posts about it. A guy just told me he lost $500 with no record of it anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:19
U think a currency that jumps thousands of dollars from one day to the next is gonna attract anything but unsavory Wolf of Wallstreet types? It’s only gonna get worse with all these people buying in because they here they can make a killing. They don’t realize that it takes YEARS though. They will grow impatient and sell sell and either barely break even or lose $$. Only a small % of ppl will make $$and they are the ones who are mining, which is impossible at this point for the average person to make a profit doing,  or the ones who got in early. That’s it.

I’ve watched the videos I didn’t read the “ white paper” ( you sound like a cult member FYI) but don’t all the videos just regurgitate the same info anyways? It drops s bunch of terminology and buzz words like “ block chain “ yet no real world application or use is mentioned. It’s all based on “good faith “ that this is worth what a bunch of people say it’s worth. No actual value. I guess u can say the same for paper money tho BUT I can actually go into a store and buy something with dollar bills. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:51:20

@_date: 2017-12-02 20:14:30
The block chain being worked on the most would be favored by the chain over a smaller block right? So that means it could possibly be tossed out of the pool. Right ? So someone with an orphan or newer block we will call it ,gets shit on by the conventional block. THEREFORE , It’s common for those running blocks that aren’t dominate to be rejected , and causing them to not get the incentive. Nothing I’m saying is ridiculous. I don’t care how many languages U speak. I’m making valid statements. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:10:04
- the resources it takes to mine is ridiculous 
- still no practical real world application 
- it’s value comes from a pot of money that depends on others “ sticking it out “ 
- an uneven playing field 
- the only ones profiting are the whales
- it attracts “ unsavory” types 
- not enough information about HOW it actually works ,it’s just a bunch of jargon getting regurgitated over and over 
- the only advantage to Decentralization is anonymity? Which isn’t even true to begin with. 
- It’s a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:30:18
There’s no advantage to that other than saying it to make ppl feel good. There’s nothing wrong with a Centralized location. It actually makes it MORE stable. Spreading it out makes it more vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:16

Why wouldn’t invest firms or people with money to buy the best equipment , not just corner thx market or whatever? Also , where do the ppl that mine them actually mine them from ? Sorry.

Oh. So it’s like P2P sharing. The Miners are the ones maintaining the block chain so they earn $ for doing that

On a practical level, with more outlets for real world use and application , it can work. Hoarding Bitcoin and day trading etc , brings the greed element into it. It almost magnifies it and makes it attract that element. Once more places accept BTC, it’ll make it more legit and stable.
