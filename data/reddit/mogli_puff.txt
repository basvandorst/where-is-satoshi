It's been steadily growing over the last 2 years since I started, I'm not selling very often, and I plan to eventually just hold bitcoin. Theres several other factors that are keeping me from going all the way right now, so I just need to keep that flexibility.

Nobody said I was an expert.
This thread isn't about how I trade, it's not about what's working or isn't, the why shouldn't matter. I'm just trying to figure out the safest way to convert my investments to btc over time, since it's nothing like the stock market.

Primarily hold, but some of both

I'm mixing bitcoin investments with stocks and like to switch back and forth depending on the state of things.

Fair point. I saw it as more of a callout. Reading that made me decide that's the last time I click on NY Post. I hope others will do the same.

Part of my reasoning for this post was because I'm worried about what's secure and what's not.
You have both enlightened me and scared me at the same time...
Will be 
Thanks kind stranger!

This is so cool I'm 100% buying one. Thanks so much to you and all the contributors!
I dont even need it for myself but I still wanna read it, and it'll be so nice to have around for when that  friend or relative comes around asking about bitcoin. Here, read this!!! Haha

I just realised I cant buy it right now because my bank froze my card. How ironic! I have bitcoin though ;)
