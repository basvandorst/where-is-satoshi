The developers tend to own a lot of the crypto they work on and get a huge reward that way.

Calling it right now, huge slump in bitcoin price in February for college kids cashing out a portion to enjoy spring break.

Society is a whole is getting robbed by the top 1% in amounts greater than ever seen before. A decentralized system will ultimately reduce the amount of "theft" overall imo.

I think bitcoin has at least a 50% chance to hit $25k+ within the next 5 years and 25% chance to hit over $100k within the next 10 years.
At minimum, 20% down on your dream house that you could still comfortably afford to pay the mortgage with your regular jobs and $100k into S&amp;P 500/stocks.
At maximum, diversify 50% of your bitcoin into other asset classes like S&amp;P 500, real estate, and your and your wife's personal health/safety. 
Buying a house outright or 20% down in this market just depends on how much of your portfolio you want to diversify into real estate. If you can find a dream house for &lt; $500k, I'd say buy it outright, not having to worry about a mortgage is great peace of mind, and having about 25% of your net worth in real estate protects you against a bitcoin crash. 
If she is the gold digger type (high maintenance, not business savvy, makes and breaks friendships easily) then don't tell her and say all the extra money (see notices) comes from a promotion at work. 
Otherwise I'd only disclose to her that you got really lucky in the stock market and have $250k saved up and that she can quit her job to look for something she really loves. Going from $100k to 2 million in networth is going to spoil/ruin the average person, so I think it is reasonable to keep most of it a secret for now. Not letting your wife get a job she loves is evil and dumb tho.

Yeah but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Thinking a few steps ahead and delaying to tell your wife is completely reasonable.
