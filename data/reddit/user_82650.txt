Could you explain how the fuck this post: 
[ELI5 What will exactly happen if the Blocksize Limit is removed completely?](
goes against any rules?

Yes, we know that.
But you can't talk about a censored subreddit in that same subreddit. So it's kinda pointless.

The mod has explained himself many times: it's pretty much "the sub is mine and I do what I want with it, and there's nothing you or anyone can do about it, bitches".
Which is of course reddit's official policy regarding content moderation.
