There is a saying "The wheels at the IRS turn slowly, but they grind fine". Sure the IRS won't catch you day one, or even year one, or maybe not even on year ten, but there is no statute of limitations on tax evasion. I guarantee that the government is quietly archiving as much data on these transaction as it can, because who knows, maybe in 5 years someone will develop a foolproof de-anonimizer and then they can simply send everyone a bill and prosecute enough to get the rest to fall into line.

I think you are overestimating the likelihood of those documents existing. It appears that the FBI identified the main SR server somehow, and then politely asked a foreign law enforcement to look into it. The foreign law enforcement agency did something and handed the FBI SR on a silver platter. I'm not sure you can even drag the actions of a foreign law enforcement agency into a US court if all of their actions took place overseas.

I agree, but if the government thinks that the "crime" you are covering up is solely a basis for a 5th amendment claim, they just might call that bluff. If they do find something really bad, they will be sure to nail you to the cross for what they can charge you with and the judge will lightly bump up your sentence to the higher end of the scale.

If the sole point of breaking up the transaction is to avoid the reporting requirement, and the government can prove that, the time involved is pretty much irrelevant.

Considering that crazy currencies like laundry detergent have been used in money laundering cases, this case isn't really invoking that big a response outside this little echo chamber.

The ability to claim safe harbor protection is pretty cut and dry. The moment you start encouraging an illegal behavior, you start losing that protection. That's one of the reasons that Craigslist got rid of the "Adult Services" section in many jurisdictions, they didn't want to appear to be promoting prostitution.

Thousands of folks live off the grid in the US, deal solely in cash, have no bank account and pay no income tax. It's a rough life, you can't get a loan for anything, folks are hesitant to rent to you and your job prospects are limited to roughly the same as for undocumented workers. But hey, with the optimistic attitude around here, I'm sure sidechains or negativecoin transactions or whatnot will let folks eat, drive and live in bitcoins on the way to the moon.

Of course the government could always grant you immunity for any additional information revealed during the search, which side-steps 5th amendment problems.

Way to publicly confess to smurfing, better hope the feds never link you to that account.

Fractional reserve banking creates far more money than the central banks, and you are crazy if you think that bitcoin will somehow dodge that bullet if it goes mainstream. Hell, I'm pretty sure that many of the companies doing "off the blockchain" transactions are already engaged in it.

Hell, you don't even need to clear 10k for the government to try to nab you for structuring if they are chasing you for some other offense. A few years back an attorney I know was defending some poor slob against a tax evasion charge where the DA had tacked on a smurfing charge as they were clearly trying to dodge reporting thresholds despite not actually exceeding them in the course of the activity. I think they ended up pleading out so I don't know if it would have held up in court.

Which is of little practical importance when compared to price inflation.
