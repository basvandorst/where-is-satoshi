This exists for well over a year now, but for Peercoin though.

I would not add Darkcoin and Blackcoin. 
Both are empty promises.
I will not even speak about Darkcoin as that should be well know --&gt; avoid it!
Blackcoin however is mere insta-mined, pump and dump centralized copy of Peercoin. They focus on hype and marketing and lack innovation. For example their developer has slightly modified PoS parameters and called it PoS 2.0 claiming it is revolutionary.

I'm just trying to tell you that you are wrong, those information you toss around are fake are result of manipulation by shady individuals behind both Darkcoin and Blackcoin. They want you to think that, so you can fill their pockets.

Right, they care so much about this.

It can drop connection to nodes that misbehave though.

nope. People will move on p2p exchanges, naturally. Just it wont be your BitShares stuff, mr. delegate.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:46:57


Ok, when did this happened and on which blockchain? Did I miss something?
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:45:23


nope. Nobody is going to use that.
