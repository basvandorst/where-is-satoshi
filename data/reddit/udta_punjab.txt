Or i dunno, instead of dying in the cold water, swim out and grab another board. They were around a massive ship after all

I cant even figure out what your argument it. Make some sense.
There is no difference between QR paper wallets and 12 seed wallets. There has to be a way to secure and identify your wallets physically, whether it be 12 words you remember, write down or backup photos of online.
I'm not sure why you call this bonehead development. You want physical backups of wallets, because you drop your phone into oceans. But you hate keeping physical backups?

That's why you sweep.

You didn't understand him. Backup all your seeds for all your wallets and you're good.
He was saying that if you sweep a key from wallet A to a wallet B, then you better back up wallet B too. Because wallet A doesn't have those coins anymore.

It's pretty easy though, move bitcoins to a new wallet, then sweep your btg/btc/bcore from old addresses with coinomi. Don't know about bitcoin diamond though.

Seriously! I am sitting in grad school worried about the us govt tax increase on grad students. 
I'm wondering how I'll work for 25 years and save enough for 30-40 years after that. And there are people with no plans whatsoever.
Why hasn't he already cashed out hundred bitcoins already is beyond me.

censorship resistant decentralized peer to peer currency/payment protocol. Why is it needed?
1) Digital Currency -- Look at how governments mismanage their currency. Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela in recent history destroyed their citizens life savings. Chinese/Zimbabwe/other communist govt are also famous for just confiscating wealth of rich individuals
2) Payment Network/Store of value -- This may seem stupid concerning what the fees currently are. But Visa/Mastercard charge 3-4% for each transaction. Even good digital alternatives like Paypal have taken that model. Bitcoin without scalability problems gives extremely low transaction fees, and with LN can even enable microtransactions!
I mean, what you listed could hold true for in-game points handed out in freemium mobile games.

What exchanges would be good ideas for someone considering cashing out?
COnsidering speed/solvency/reliability issues.

Haven't done the calculations, but most likely constant sell pressure from the miners who need to pay their electricity /asicminer bills.

You and someone else put btc in a multi-signature address on the blockchain -- say 5 by you and 5 by him. Then you design a set of transactions that pay you out 5 and him 5, but you don't commit it!. If you want to send him 1 btc, you design a new set of transactions that pay you out 4 and him out 6, again without committing it! There are details on how it is handled to make it completely safe and trust-less.  
This way you take transactions off chain. Essentially you and someone else maintain your own personal ledger which you settle on blockchain. Now, if a customer wants to pay a merchant, he can just pay someone on this "lightning network", who will pay someone else, and finally someone will pay the merchant.

Just want to make sure my coins are safe, so asking a stupid question.
An account I made with the 12 word seed on Electrum is on the blockchain of both forks, and can be moved to Breadwallet because BIP39/44 are standards. Right?
