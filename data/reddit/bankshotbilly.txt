Will you still be able to buy LTC or ETH on GDAX during this time? I have USD set to deposit tomorrow, and want it to make its way over to bittrex...

Am I wrong or can China not trade BTC bc of their government? Still might be true when Korea and Japan wake up though.

That's about $2,200,000 more than I have vested LOL
But I'm getting there!! Best of luck

I meant actually awake. It's about 4:30am in China I doubt everyone's up and heard the news.

Are you saying there's going to be a dip or this is the new bottom?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:42:07
Ah you are right my friend. Still before 6 am though, happy I don't get up before then lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:26:56
Me either man. Frustrating to say the least, but might be a good thing for BCH once the fork "happens or doesn't happen"
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:59:43
I'm... well... who cares we all fucked up
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:16:10
Ah I wasn't aware of that. Good insights 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:01:52
So will this cause people to buy into BTC or sell off? Is it the same scenario that we had before they canceled the first time??
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:10:12
There's no one special enough in my life to sell my BTC for �� sorry mah
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:46:46
I've got my alerts set at 7500 too. I hope and pray we see 6800
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:23:01
They royally f***ed the fork up, GDAX and Coinbase said everything is back up to speed
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:45:38
I mean for the real break through, 8.500, 9.000, 10.000! Seems like there needs to be some breaking news for it to gain momentum again. Right now everyone is holding at ATH and everyone else is too scared to jump on board 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:44:19
Especially with the Segwit2x news that it might still try and go through...
What is that going to mean??
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:57:46
WHAT THE FUGGGGG
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:04:42
I hate to cry conspiracy but it's an awfully big coincidence we went to an ATH today and then this news comes out...
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:14:31
Where do you think it will bottom off at once Asia wakes up to the news today? Or will it give more confidence and skyrocket?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:23:20
but I haven't traded any btc since the announcement
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:03:30
Sorry mate I had a little too much to drink last night and was in a little bit of a tiff about the segwit news.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:53:41
No, no one else saw the email they sent out to every single person on Coinbase and GDAX list
