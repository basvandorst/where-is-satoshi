Any examples of this? I use BTC to buy games and computer parts online and I'm starting to get a bit worried.. Especially since I run windows. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:16:39
I use it most of the time. It isn't slow and clunky like Firefox and doesn't track everything I do like Chrome :)

For some reason my pi was set up with no swap partition when I got it. This caused it to hard lock any time it got close to filling up the RAM. If you run into trouble, give it a quick Google for a solution. (Sorry, I can't remember the solution off-hand, but it wasn't too hard to find)
@_date: 2016-04-22 02:03:21
Don't Australians pay ridiculously high prices for games? Doesn't this essentially mean they can get around that by spoofing their IP and then spending in BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:01:51
IIRC, this was the guide I used:
If you have a fresh raspberry pi and don't want to get your hands too dirty, you may instead be able to find an image that has everything preloaded. Good luck! :)

The one that keeps your water clean, electricity running, and roads (somewhat) maintained.

A bitcoin ATM, maybe?
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:59:46
X bitcoin are made every day. 
After a halving (which happens roughly every 4 years), X is divided by 2.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:37:34
Yeah, until they inevitably become a monopoly and do *nothing*, but gather money. Then we're back at the same problem.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:40:53
This site should tell you everything you need to know about bitcoin halvings
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:20:22
It's quite nice. A bit more powerful than I thought it would be.. right now it's running the BTC node, as well as a personal cloud storage service I use for friends and family. 
I also hooked up an external enclosure with an SSD in it, so it can hold the entire blockchain without needing any extra power :)

The OS that comes with it, Raspbian
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:21:52
LN can handle sub-satoshi payments, sort of.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:24:00
Localbitcoins, decentralized exchanges, paying for stuff directly (a pipe dream til the scaling issue is fixed sadly)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:10:33
From what I've read of it, it seems like a decentralized localbitcoins rather than an exchange for day-trading. I could be misunderstanding it, though.
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:14:18
Lost my job recently.. and for some reason I'm more incentivized to find a new one by getting paid in Bitcoin than by anything else.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:28:02
I keep a small amount on Coinbase for spending and keep my hoard on a paper wallet. I think this is more or less the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:56:32
Woah, I'm confused. When did "non-techncial" go from being an Apple thing to being an MS thing?
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:12:54
.Are you a Linux programmer? :p
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:11:52
Coinbase is pretty good for recurring buys if you're in the US. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 06:04:48
I don't trust ADP to handle BTC. They can't even handle HTML.
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:58:58
Man, wish I could get a beer for $3.50..
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:50:11
Spoonrocket sounds like the way to go. They are outside my office quite often.. Where does it say that they're taking btc? (I'm on mobile, doesn't look like the site says anything.)
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:12:56
From my understanding, VC money flowing into all tech startups has been slowing down. This isn't necessarily a Bitcoin thing.
@_date: 2018-10-26 01:39:10
In plain English, the amount of bitcoin constantly entering the ecosystem halves every 4ish years.  
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:47:57
If the supply entering the economy shrinks, and the demand remains the same, price will rise. 
Take a look at  to see how precious halvenings have affected price. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 17:24:06
Easy answer: Buy some off Circle or Coinbase. If you want to get super deep into it and have total control of your money, work your way into doing the stuff laid out.
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:01:49
I've thought of this before, but in a different context. What if a major already-existing mining operation (or a handful of them), decided "Hey, this shitcoin should die", switch to that network, and 51% attack it. If you take the hashrate from BTC compared to BCH, it looks very plausible.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:22:11
yeah no.. don't take this advice, even if it's (hopefully) a joke.
Best time to buy is when you have the disposable income to do so.
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:08:28
I don't even want to think about how complicated that makes taxes in the US..
How does BlockFi make money? And what happens to all your coins if they get hacked?
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:17:07
I looked into it, you definitely get taxed on the interest you make, as you do with any other kind of interest.
@_date: 2019-10-06 05:12:03
This is already happening to some degree in VRChat.
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:04:19
Just remember to play the long game. Put money in it and forget about it for a while, otherwise the volatility will get to you.
I can almost say for certain you'll make money, as long as you stick to it and don't sell at a loss.
@_date: 2016-10-02 04:18:41
I've been using it for a few months now. I just leave it on the "block everything" mode, which is the default.
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:42:23
I have a buddy that needed to borrow money for plane tickets (needed to buy them that day), but he lives over an hour away.
Can I transfer the money? No, we have different banks and it will take way too long.
Can I send it over PayPal? Nope, that also takes a few days.
How about Google Wallet? We both have accounts. Still no, it takes 3 days to retrieve the money to your bank account.
After exhausting all of these possibilities, he ended up having to take a bus and a train here so I could give him cash and he could deposit the cash to his account.
If he had a BTC debit card, I could have sent that money instantly and he could have spent it instantly.
I did get to have lunch with him though, so at least there's that.
@_date: 2016-10-02 04:19:45
I mean, Mozilla, Google, and MS get nothing for you using their browser, either.
@_date: 2015-11-24 06:18:46
Sadly, that's the problem right now. It's supposed to be a currency, but as it is now, it can mostly only be used as an investment. The only people that can get away with losing a ton from BTC's swings are people that are already really well off.
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:24:31
Sorry, I misspoke. He already paid for the tickets, but needed extra money to check some bags, which (for whatever reason) needed to use the same account.
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:31:59
Without all the extra layers and services on it, isn't Bitcoin totally anonymous? This assumes you bought your coins for cash and never link the wallet to an email address or something like that.
@_date: 2015-11-24 17:41:46
If most of your money is in Btc and you're trying to live off it, you have less buying power when the price goes down. You don't need to exchange to fiat for it to be "lost money"
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:05:50
Oh well, I'm not complaining. We have too many people here anyway. Maybe the businesses will move to a state that's less overpopulated and under-hydrated.
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:19:45
I'm also thinking of buying into it since my company does 401k/ROTH matching. That's free money!
@_date: 2015-03-08 06:03:13
Play some Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright. It will do you some good.

I don't often do a real facepalm at comments. Thank you for that. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:56:18
I'd also like to know more about this feature. I couldn't find anything on their website about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:30:22
Know any good local banks in the Bay Area? I'm also stuck with Wells Fargo and would be glad to dump them.
