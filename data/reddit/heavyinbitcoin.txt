Gold fell over 25% in 2008 before making a comeback, still lost for the year.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:14:55
Probably not get it quite that cheap but easily get it under 5-10 cents for a next block transfer. Every smaller coin will be faster and cheaper than bitcoin AND bitcoin cash. I do believe if bch was used as much or more than bitcoin there would be bigger problems than the size of a fee such as centralization. But yes nobody is using bch and if the same amount that use bitcoin started using it fees would be much higher in bch as well...

Asking for a friend. Is cashing out 60btc over 15k in 2017 considered small fish/lost in sea of users?

"You all need to grow up and learn to behave like adults or you will destroy Bitcoins first mover advantage." - That is the bcash goal...
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:06:38
Your analogy could be applied to literally every single altcoin. They are all free and nearly instant compared to bitcoin... Also, fees were high for what? a few weeks? Now bitcoin is just as fast and cheap as bcash, I mean u can send with 1 satoshi fee and get confirmed quick. Bcash has no legs to stand on imo.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:48:09
It does this all the time on bitmex. Its just a glitch, price never fell..Refreshing can fix the problem.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:29:32
Well it was 2008/2009. If this repeated bitcoin would surely decrease in value with ALL assets, JUST LIKE gold did contrary to what someone said below. I feel it would not decrease as much as other assets and be a safe haven, like gold was.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:32:29
Yes and they only buy cheap.

Been invested since 2015, to be honest I just want to make a buck, and i surely have. But I still want more. Whatever option will buy me the most lambos is the end goal i choose! Whether that's in bitcoin or dollars i dont care. If i had to choose, Id choose bitcoin because id like to see the dollar get upended.

Take what I say knowing I'm just an investor and don't know all the technical aspects like a dev or something would. I've done my research and chosen my coin and have done more than extremely well with it.

Weird. Im as much of a bitcoin maximalist as they come but use paypal (with credit card) for every single thing i buy. Why wouldnt i want full protection to return anything i want and also collect 2% cashback? I can see it sucks for the seller but for a buyer paypal cant be beat.

So they wont become cheaper than usual when mempool clears? And mempool will behave as what we are use to? I was expecting it to clear out and be cheaper. I need to read up on segwit lol
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:39:25
I use Trezor and dont carry it around. I keep some spending money in just a jaxx wallet which i know is risky but its just small amounts. I treat the trezor as a "bank" sort of. I thought the trezor is trusting nobody? Like if trezor dies im still fine, and they cant help me recover or access account. Is this device also allowing this feature or better? I want maximum security is my number 1
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:35:56
I have finally mined my goal of 50btc. I am now selling as i mine, is 50btc too much to hold in trezor? I dont plan to add more.
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:42:27
Also sorry i dont know the technical way to say it but with mmgen am i trusting anyone but myself? Not suggesting this is any way but if mmgen goes under is my coin safe?
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:22:04
Wow is this actually  safer than using a hardware wallet like he says????
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:09:56
Yeah lmao. Well i still feel content with r/btc suffering and us celebrating. Roger i guess is smarter than i thought by doing the opposite what he promoted and kept all his btc instead of bch. What a hypocrite! Lol

It is true that overall quadriga has given me everything I'm owed at every request and frankly have given me the best crypto purchasing and selling experience I've ever used. Including coinbase. Very sad the way this story has changed.

Nope you get the coins if in cold storage too. With bitcoin cash i had in trezor anf increased my bitcoin holdings by nearly 20%...
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:31:05
Thanks I hope so.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:16:25
Why would I change from trezor?
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:27:51
Respectfully. I've changed my tune. I agree with the naysayers calling scam and also think Gerry is still alive.
However from my original stance I had no way of knowing this and since my first cash out years ago it was always a long wait with quadriga but always came and even got a cash out just 1 month ago.. The whole time people always crying scam so I thought this was just more of the same.
I feel bad for those that may have been scammed and hope they get their money back. As for Gerry. Man you made me look bad if this turns out to be true...
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:24:53
This is stupid. Spending is selling. HODL folks.

If you actually made a lot of money (over $500k or so) and you weren't that rich before you will have no choice but to pay taxes. If you made $200k or less I wouldnt worry about it, they are investigating the big and obvious ones only.
Source: I was audited in March and had to explain why several hundred thousands of dollars was being direct deposited into my bank account when my job only pays 60k. Expensive lesson.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:39:46
Agreed. What a disgusting person. By the way they never had "insolvency issues". I've received over 100 withdraws from them over the years. Yes On occasion some took almost a month but I ALWAYS got paid WITHOUT needing to ask or provide extra shit. More than I can say for other exchanges. 
I've used cash delivery, cheques, wire transfers, and ETFs. Stop believing the BS you read here from these trolls that probably dont have a verified account trying to withdraw /deposit $10 only the most demanding times for bitcoin and making a huge fuss...The money you sell for is locked in at that price. Read the bank lawsuit jeesus their hands are tied...We all got paid man anyways man... Very sad you would be so insensitive at a time like this to a true Bitcoin Hero like Gerry really was.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:24:14
Yes, unfortunately he has..
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:06:45
Ok....either way he doesnt owe anything. Hes not getting away with anything...I hope hes not dead and enjoying his wealth on a beach somewhere....No one can be upset..
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:05:57
Shut the fuck up. You will feel terrible for this when you get paid. The mans dead for christ sakes.

What obligations? Do they owe you money?
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:05:09
I also complained like you but always got paid...This can all be proven if you actually doubt me
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:05:13
Yes it appears he actually passed in December but the company just putting out statement now. I'm sure he is looking down smiling at getting proven right vs the banks.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:41:59
Because your an insensitive no coiner lol. Why would I receive all my withdraws over the years with the most recent being just a few months ago(well over 7 figures total) and you not receive yours. Your a disgusting person.
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:02:57
Makes no sense. Regardless AAPL and BTC are extremely cheap and great longs here. I'm adding to both.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:06:45
It makes sense because i dont buy or sell the dips and actually cash out etc. Occasionally mess around on bitmex on a big crash but thats about it. I dont care about the fluctuations because i didnt plan to buy or sell anyways. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:47:09
Fair enough. If he truly is owed I can understand. I just find it hard to believe based on my experiences.
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:28:31
3 months lmfao that is all? You will for sure get paid now I know your a fucking joke. It has taken longer than 3 months on one occasion for me...That is the proof you have for these nasty allegations?

I have a few bucks on there but no in general I dont keep large amounts of cash on quadriga. I have withdrawn millions over the years. Most of which was in 2018. Your incorrect in your assumption. They have been late but they always pay. Why would they treat me differently?
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:25:43
Why would they pay me and everyone I know. I've referred dozens of friends and family over the years and all have successfully withdrawn. To me it looks like your a troll with 0 proof.

Im 100% core and a huge bitcoin supporter. I didnt support the bitcoin cash fork but afterwards i sure did. (Increased my holdings by 20% while bitcoin went up 1k at same time)
Why are people against these "dividends" i am very excited for 2x and hope i can get another 20%, i havent increased my holdings by that much in years...
Let the trolls have their shitcoin and leave us alone and makes us a hell of alot richer. Its literally a ein win win all the eay around. I fail to see the problem. Bitcoin with segwit is fucking amazing now.
TLDR -  I want one of these forks every month!
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:33:12
I dont agree with this. I certainly have far too much. I have more bitcoin than my total networth. Yet i sleep fine at night and check the price a maximum of 5 times a day, some days none, other days once or twice. Some days i have a paper "loss" or "gain" of my entire yearly before tax salary. Im not sure why i am immume to this, perhaps it has to do with conviction/confidence in it?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:28:13
Spending bitcoin is absurd...UNLESS you are replacing them. The value will continue to rise why the heck would you spend it. HODL for life. Use your credit card and get 2% cashback and warranty and 30 days free credit and returns. Dont spend an appreciating asset. Spend a depreciating one like fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:20:38
No....for sure lol. This is widely known and the code widely reviewed.

You have no idea what your talking about. Ive held several hundred coins on my trezor for years. Is that substantial enough? I DO know whether my unit was flashed with decoy firmware or has a backdoor as i can READ the damn source code myself.

@_date: 2017-09-17 14:37:04
This man is a liar and a cheat. I have 0 respect for him and the fact that he is so obsessed with coins makes me very sad. Everything hes touched since mcafee antivirus 20 years ago has turned to trash. Hes a criminal and a disgusting person. Also a drug addict. His "mining company" got delisted and now trades on the otc markets. It has fallen in price since it ipo. Before bitcoin started rallying his company was a "security specialty" company. Now hes a mining company with 0 profits for shareholders. Sad this kind of stuff is possible.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:48:09
I see thanks for the explanation. Worrysome indeed.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:47:47
Id use it but i wouldnt hoard it. Ill rephrase. Anyone that has a decent chunk of bitcoin cares deeply about the price. Better? If the price were to never change it would be wise to hold zero bitcoin as your money is not working for you and only buy it as you need it. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:39:13
Your delusional. Blockchain is just a ledger and not valuable like bitcoin is without the massive mining and decentralization it has. Banks are already essentially proof of stake instant transactions. Bitcoin is the only non reversible decentralized unstoppable means of transacting. Among many other things. The way people define "blockchain" is bitcoin. There is no "blockchain" the way its described without bitcoin.

Honestly im not sure. Although i will add the few times ive "gambled" on leverage at bitmex or something i am glued to the price and freak out over any change despite whats at risk to be an extremely small % of my total holdings. Ahhhhhhhaa i know why now. Its because i am at risk of losing "bitcoin". My goal has always been to increase my bitcoin because i believe in it long term. At bitmex my bitcoin is at stake. In my trezor its not (or so i hope)  :P
