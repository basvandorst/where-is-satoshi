You are showing your companies products because you stand to gain financially from this conference.  Its now crystal clear why you are such a strong supporter of moe and the conference. Garza and his companies are bad for bitcoin, but god forbid you may be inconvenienced by a boycot of the event or a cancellation.  You see this event as one that you could make money at and you already whined about how you already paid for your ticket and room for could be boycotted or canceled.  Unbelievable how self-righteous you are.

Well then he can use his businesses line of credit to borrow money.
Non profits still pay their employees.  Moe didnt set up the conference to take a loss, no one believes that for a single second.  I get it that you like the guy and you want to defend him, but jesus chirst, were not fucking stupid.

Taking money from and naming garza and co a premier sponsor of your event is supporting them.  
Save some extra seats for the miami swat team, ill be sending a contingent of law enforcement, maybe they want to buy some paycoin.

Borrow the money, or file bankruptcy if garza is out of jail long enough to sue
There are other options.  Moe hasnt even tried to crowd-source the funds needed to get rid of josh garza, we are on a bitcoin talk board for christ sake!

So moe charges sponsors 30k to speak, moe doesnt pay anyone to speak at his even, moe works for free cause its a non-profit and he cares and shit, and Moe is such a great dude that he only charges guests 180 bucks to attend, LOL.
Seems like there is a metric shit load of money being generated, but no real expenditures other than the venue.  For that amount of money, he could build a small venue.  
Seems like moe focuses on making money, like everyone else.

I dont either, but at least he would be trying to right a wrong as opposed to just standing by idly and doing nothing and letting a piece of shit speak at his event.

whats understood doesnt need to be explained.  The sky is blue, grass is green, this shits basic im not gonna write you a fucking thesis paper about it.  If you dont think paycoin is a scam, then vote with your cash and buy some you ignorant fuck.
