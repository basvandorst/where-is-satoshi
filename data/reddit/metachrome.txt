You're absolutely right. But, both the lack of declaring Bitcoin liabilities (presumably because of their unclear legal status) and their very casual valuation at MtGox's own last trading price are the disturbing aspects to me. Never mind that the announcement about blocking bitcoin withdrawals from MtGox crashed the price from a healthy $950 market-wide in the first place.
Thank you, btw, for your eloquent translation of the original documents. We are all desperately looking for information to make more sense of the situation and this really helps. Good or bad, I prefer to know. Jason and you are providing important insights. Thanks!

I think we are dealing with two different interest groups and both can be served. Some people may simply want their coins and cash back, never to deal with such uncertainty again. Some others have been in this for the long run and are willing to accept some risks. I propose an opt-in/opt-out model...
* If you are part of the first group (low risk, cash out) you'll opt-out. This means you will be payed back faster, but once all your claims are settled you're out.
* The second group is less risk averse and will have an interest to opt-in. This means they will get the smaller share of the regular payouts, but they stay in for the long run. Once their claims are settled they still remain shareholders of the company and continue to receive payouts.
The exact maths might need to be worked out, but...
One could image an 80/20 payout scheme where the opt-out group receives 80% of the payouts and the opt-in group shares the remaining 20%. Over time, as more of the opt-out group gets paid off and presumably business develops, 20% start looking like a good share and will begin to accellerate the repayment of the opt-in group. Once all opt-outs are paid off the payout for the opt-in group jumps to 100%.
You could even sprinkle this model with a form of interest payments that increase the longer you are prepared to wait for your full claims settlement.
If drawn up in such a way goxproject.com could play a central role not only in the recovery of lost funds for mtgox victims, but for the price and future of Bitcoin in general.
Lets face it: the current price stagnation has a lot to do with a lack of trust in the safety of your assets. People are holding off their investments and watching very closely how the community will handle this loss. If we don't do well and instead wash our hands and troll out insults then you can kiss the value of your coins goodbye. No-one will want them, even if they're limited to 21million.
I personally think Olivier Janssens is treading very wisely with both projects to recover this money. I will support both, because I have lost btc myself.

True, I saw that as well...
but it's the only value listed for bitcoins in both assets and liabilities. Where are the huge amounts of Bitcoin liabilities? That's what worries me. Unless MtGox really still considers them 'temporarily inaccessible'. With my losses I'd love to believe that version.

Fairly outrageous.
MtGox assert that their BTC liabilities are limited to the amount of BTC they actually have in their assets?? At going rates **they have and they owe only 13,900.00 BTC??** (901,952,870 JPY = 13,900 BTC)
Am I overlooking something?
Also, it appears that MtGox did manage to lose 75% of customer deposits! I took Liabilities, point 3. Deposits of 5,502,576,538 yen and subtracted Assets, point 6. Other deposits (Deposits from users) of 1,384,057,302 yen
Again, please show me where I miscalculated. I'm begging to be wrong on this!

**Which BTC exchange rate is MtGox using to calculate assets and liabilities in Bitcoin?**
More importantly, how were the liabilities calculated, because the numbers don't line up. I can retrace the asset calculation somewhat...
**Step 1.** From the leaked database, sum up all currency liabilities (I did that in USD for an overview) and subtract the 2.8 billion JPY losses in fiat currency as reported by the document "20140228-announcement_eng.pdf" on the mtgox.com site:
924,124.6512 AUD = 826,661.29 USD
320,184.36558 CAD = 288,013.28 USD
99,487.07308 CHF = 113,388.50 USD
297,775.78994 CNY = 48,472.42 USD
112,264.56207 DKK = 20,848.03 USD
5,634,625.59531 EUR = 7,808,516.62 USD
921,892.96793 GBP = 1,531,638.09 USD
740,519.14894 HKD = 95,378.87 USD
384,885,150.13700 JPY = 3,746,023.17 USD
91,346.00305 NOK = 15,269.89 USD
58,224.95320 NZD = 49,288.88 USD
1,645,194.67364 PLN = 539,673.50 USD
551,162.54477 RUB = 15,097.45 USD
15,335.84383 SEK = 2,402.38 USD
43,193.59706 SGD = 34,037.51 USD
666,464.33497 THB = 20,538.19 USD
30,611,805.67481 USD = 30,611,805.67 USD
Total currency assets as per book keeping = 45,767,053.75 USD = 4,716,990,382.39 JPY
Total currency assets as per actual findings = 4,716,990,382.39 JPY - 2,800,000,000 JPY **= 1,916,990,382.39 JPY**
This would mean that more than half of all fiat deposits were lost!
**Step 2.** Take the BTC liabilities from the leaked database and subtract the customer and mtgox amounts that were reported lost in "20140228-announcement_eng.pdf", sadly (or rather shockingly), I am using $135 to the BTC. Then convert to JPY:
951,116.21905382 BTC - 744,408 BTC (customer coins) - 100,000 BTC (mtgox coins) = 106,708.22 BTC = 14,405,609.57 USD **= 1,480,104,355.50 JPY**
**Step 3.** Add in some smaller company cash and physical assets of around $4.33 million for good measure (this was arbitrarily chosen, but is as plausible an amount as any)
4,329,518.40 USD **= 444,771,425.11 JPY**
**Step 4.** Sum it all up and you get...
1,916,990,382.39 JPY + 1,480,104,355.50 JPY + 444,771,425.11 JPY **= 3,841,866,163 JPY**
...the company assets listed as per "20140228-announcement_eng.pdf"
Even if you disagree with guessing a number for step 3, the BTC to USD rate would only amount to $175.57
On the other hand, how the liabilities were calculated by MtGox puzzles me because even the BTC losses of 744,408 coins alone would amount to 10,323,859,568 JPY and not 6,501,119,371 JPY. And that's going by the miserable and untenable rate of $135 to the BTC last published on their site before shutdown.
