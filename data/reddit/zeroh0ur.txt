It`s like TVIX!
Ok, not really. And TVIX is a fucking nightmare.

There are other reasons to mine. I don't need a bank or circle account and I have bitcon.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:13:59
My guess is Fantasyland.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:28:46
What if bitcoins are $20k/ea in the future?
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:29:00
Could you sell btc but only accept money orders for payment?
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:17:06
Well, considering that about 85% of people are complete idiots, I can`t say that I`m surprised. If you don`t believe this statistic, you are one of them. Oh, and I think the 85% figure is rather generous.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:59:15
Are the BTC lost or stolen? If stolen, the BTC are still out there in someone's wallet, so no effect on scarcity.
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:28:35
Banks never require a passport. Why do exchanges? Not everyone is a fucking world traveler. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:00:10
Hey, stop snooping my wallet.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:54:58
You can buy things with BTC. You can mine them and spend them without ever converting to USD.  Source: Have done it.
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:43:48
I was going to quote the movie but screw it... Cable Guy reference.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:32:56
How do you know they will never pay off? Never is a very long time.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:38:08
But I can't get a lap dance with extras this way!
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:06:15
I want coins to hold without involving banks and regulators, so I mine.  At best it's a get rich extremely slow plan.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:20:17
What if you forgot the passphrase?
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:08:59
Wait..... I thought GGG was how all sex was?
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:58:05
We had a couple small increases prior to the most recent larger one.   It was a nice little break.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:10:51
If you set it above your cost basis then you have made money. That is the point for traders.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:01:44
Paypal to adopt technology that negates their existence.  You just can't make this stuff up!
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:25:08
Maybe not.
@_date: 2014-09-10 01:03:40
My first tip, thanks! I'll pay it forward.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:02:43
So based on this I should quit my job, fire up TOR for a visit to the darknet, buy me some data, and start living the good life?
Do I need to move to Eastern Europe?
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:23:23
There are benefits beyond profit. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:26:00
Everyone shut off your miners for the next 2 weeks. Then turn them back on after difficulty nosedives. Great success.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:53:39
I heard GOX had some issues recently.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:46:45
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Thanks paypal,
And fuck you!
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:03:51
I thought the ebay fee was based on the auction value and charged at the end of the month. I have accepted checks and money orders in the past, but I still had to pay ebay their cut.  So if you accepted bitcoin, you would still owe ebay their money in USD$.
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:28:44
It's something a smart person would say. Broke people shouldn't be gambling on bitcoin or anything else.
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:41:52
Part of it is my desire to operate totally in the realm of bitcoin. I don`t want to involve banks and regulators in the process. Not because I am doing anything shady (not mining nearly enough for that anyway) but because I think that is how it should be. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:42:49
Oh I know. Wishful thinking more than anything.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:15:06
My first act in the bitcoin realm was buying an ASIC. No regrets here. Not yet at break even, but it's a cool hobby.
@_date: 2014-07-08 20:16:47
Mycellum wallet has a buy/sell feature for face to face cash transactions.
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:04:34
Running a gpu miner will get you about a nickel in BTC after a year and $200 in electricity costs.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:07:33
If only a company like paypal would adopt bitcoin.....
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:21:20
They didn't reverse a transaction - they allowed an unauthorized person to make a withdrawal from your account. This was essentially a robbery. I wonder if FDIC insurance would cover you?
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:27:47
Privacy, for one thing. No bank involved, no exchange, no gov involved. Mine ---&gt; spend or hold.
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:37:05
This is one of the reasons that I mine.  I exchange dollars for hardware that produces coins instead of buying coins directly. No exchange or bank required.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:25:42
If all coins are tainted, none are tainted.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:25:05
1. Nothing is totally FED proof. They will investigate the serious offenders.
2. You CAN buy porn on ebay right now. Ebay has a shit ton of porn.
I am looking forward to trying the beta.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:46:37
My point is they are unlikely to kill you since it defeats their goal.
@_date: 2015-05-18 03:10:10
Well, if they kill you they get nothing.
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:04:06
The only people who would NEVER put this in a transaction are terrorists and drug lords.  Our regulations are PATHETIC if this s a possible vector to find bad actors.  `Hookers and blow` is a running joke in my circle of friends.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:54:16
Mining = speculation. Operating at break-even or small loss now may pay off big later. Or not.  My little mine is what I can afford to lose, nothing more. 
By the way.... don't mine.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:14:43
Ok... I get it. But morons should be excluded from technical trials.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:56:39
Peer - one that is of equal standing with another: equal; especially: one belonging to the same societal group especially based on age, grade, or status.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:57:02
My bank has my ssn# and I think that is about it!
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:03:31
I didn`t mean to imply friends. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:58:17
Spend btc for stuff, sell stuff. Profit.
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:13:39
"Hole" indeed.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:54:58
I have some hardware that might be useful again if the hash rate crashes. Should have sold it a while back b was too busy/lazy.

CNN is actually news.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:24:00
If this fuckwad is buying it might be time to sell. He had his followers piling into gold(goldline) for years, losing money hand over fist.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:21:03
It seemed he was leading a rather mundane life for a greedy kingpin.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:47:18
My peers would understand, because I don't associate with morons. The average juror doesn`t qualify as a peer to a technically adept, educated defendant. We need to demand actual peers on juries.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:26:55
Does snark differ with context?
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:47:06
There can be only one.

Declaration of Independence. Brilliant!
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:00:15
So... when a medical journal is "peer reviewed" it means some citizens read it?
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:42:28
So you`re tellin` me there`s a chance! Oh,  read ya.....
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:52:05
Once you send bitcoin it's theirs. They are not holding your bitcoin, they are taking payment in advance. If I pay my phone bill ahead that doesn't make Verizon a bank.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:11:00
Consulting fees paid in bitcoin..... or trade.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:34:23
Bitcoin don't have no CEO, dummy. 
It has a president.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:12:43
Sure you do.  It's pretty fucking obvious actually.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:45:51
Police are stupid going after backpage. It's low hanging fruit for them.
What's really needed is a darknet market for sex workers.  Reviews, email encryption and bitcoin would surely complicate the job for law enforcement and make things safer for all parties.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:31:44
99.9% of men are not interested in trafficed sex slaves.  Having a safe forum and reviews would drive business away from the bad actors and to good providers.
This sex slave bs is now justification for going after consenting adults hurting nobody.
But what about the children?!!
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:00:30
Christ, that's about 2 yeas of mining for me! Oh, to be young again.....
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:53:54
Customers (johns) would need references from other sex workers they have seen in order to be screened. It is already done this way irl, and it works perfectly well.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:46:29
My grandma has never used the internet. Ever. No email, no web, NOTHING. Worrying about grandma bitcoin use is silly.
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:40:37
Fuckng-a right they shouldn`t Chase doesn't track my USD!  
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:44:00
If I get $500 from my account in cash and spend it on cocaine Chase will freeze my account? I don't think so. Fuck you downvoters.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:02:50
Hey Genie, you get back in that fuckin bottle, ya hear?!
@_date: 2015-04-24 12:18:32
As a rule I do not take advice from people who misspell words like "bought". If English is not your first language, I take it back.
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:12:38
Or much easier if BTC price crashes.
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:15:26
And here I thought drug addicts were known to make good choices. Huh.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:10:09
Take coins to help withdrawals, don`t help with withdrawals. Profit.
