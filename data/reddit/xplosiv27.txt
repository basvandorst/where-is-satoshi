Thanks for the tips! It is to my understanding that I may be considered a trader and might be liable to income tax. Any advice for that?
Also, is tax only applicable to realised profits?

Billions is questionable. It has been said to be capable of ‘thousands of thousands’ but it is yet to be seen. Litecoin already incorporates lightning network’s atomic swap features. Best coin I’ve seen that’s in development besides those planning to use LN is called Zilliqa. It uses micro sharding of blocks to be capable of over 1000 transactions/sec - comparable with visa.

Going by Elliot wave and Fibonacci retracements, it looks like we could have a run to 23k now. I’m going by some predictions from reputable traders on TradingView.

Aka Bcash. Bots don’t allow the name in the title because it belongs in r/Bcash apparently.

Block size is not fixing the scalability issues, but a temporary fix that centralises the currency. Bch is essentially stealing the bitcoin brand name to promote a coin that is no better than litecoin or some other alts. In doing so, it is their goal to become ‘the real bitcoin’ and be dominant over core by stealing its name.

I’ve seen similar bugs on blockchain.info before. Either that or a double spend which will be revoked when the block is mined. Not too uncommon. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:24:51
Yeah, true considering the white paper wrote it that way haha 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:18:55
I’m guessing it’s because it’s a 2014 paper and such conformities were not universal back then. The paper is well written and the authors have referenced over 20 different pieces of literature so they know the topic well.

Same applies for selling. Not that I'm looking to sell anytime soon, but it's nice to know I can do so at any point. I believe coinbase currently does not support selling in the U.K. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:56:09
It only has 'send', 'receive' and 'cold storage' options for me. Perhaps region dependent?

What's the most secure and convenient way to set up such a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:52:31
If you transfer from say breadwallet to a coinbase wallet, is your btc then on the coinbase exchange?

According to TradingView, the candle wicks reached 10488 on a 1 minute chart at 19:55 for Coinbase. Bitstamp was 9369 at 19:55. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:37
It was Coinbase bouncing off 8500 though. So if anything it was bitstamp that was lagging behind. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:54
Yeah just wondered how it was over a thousand dollar difference. I was thinking maybe a huge buy order in Coinbase or something that I missed or just APIs messing up. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:56:49
Yeah it's safer to wait for the downwards trend to show signs of stopping.

It depends what you're planning to do and how much you're planning to buy. Read through all the sub Reddit. People ask all the time and there is lots of information out there. 
Anything over 1btc and I'd recommend investing in a hardware wallet. But for starting off you should do everything in small increments. Some examples of wallets/exchanges are as follows:
- Coinbase: Simple buying, selling and storing with little to worry about. Not considered the most secure because the exchange holds the coins for you. 
- Blockchain.info: a somewhat reputable wallet. Control your own keys (You hold your coins). Decent mobile support and applications. Buying function available via Coinify. 
- Kraken: Less user friendly for beginners, but more appropriate for regular trading or high volume trades. Cheaper fees than wallets and Coinbase. 
Those are a few examples of different tiers of trading/ storing. Once you control your own keys, make sure you have a very good understanding of the terminology, technology and risks involved. Once you do that then you are your own bank and you're responsible for your coins. Stick with Coinbase until you've done some reading on how everything works.

As much as I can feasible live without. Overall target for holdings is to own 1 millionth of each currency I invest in. Currently btc and ltc. So 21 and 84 coins respectively. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:18:24
It's volatile at the moment so it's difficult to say if the bottom has been reached. Looking at the price this week, it's still very much a negative gradient. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:38:43
If you're hodling in the long term, then I'm sure you'll make money. However, you could potentially get a lot more btc for your fiat if you wait 1-3 days to see how this pans out. Although BTC is not so much of a risk. It's Ethereum that you want to stay away from right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:02:29
Nice profit for an hours work if they sell now 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:47:55
Haha highly improbable. Then again, I’m sure people would have said it’s not possible for btc to reach 5k back in 2011. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:53:07
I think each scenario is equally unlikely lol

Cryptowat.ch is good for showing best buying and selling prices across the most popular exchanges.

It is meant to be referring to day trading as oppose to investing. I definitely agree that the stigma attached to crypto investing doesn’t have any connotations as such. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:08:27
It’s referring to trading, not investing or using. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:18:29
A solar flair would probably do it... 
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:49:13
It was referring more towards electromagnetic storms and the disruptions to satellites and communications (internet), as well as power outages. Imagine the hash rate drop when miners suddenly don’t have access to power or the blockchain. The time to solve a block would become ridiculous, not to mention the potential large flares have to permanently damage electronic infrastructure.
