If bitcoin is suppose to be encrypted transactions, why do I need email address, last 4 of social, street address, and front and back of drivers license?! Any transaction I make has my name all over it, no? I thought ppl used BTC to buy shady stuff from the internet. I’m very confused and I’m hesitant to use BTC to buy stuff now. Am I looking at this wrong?

Ok great. Now I still need to tumble my Litecoin. I don’t want to send from Coinbase to seller because I’ve heard of people losing their Coinbase account if Coinbase does not like who you sent your coin too. I have a Blockchain app that I used to tumble my bitcoins a while back, but Blockchain does not have a LTC wallet. So I’m asking what app/wallet do you recommend for tumbling LTC out of Coinbase/gdax?  Thank you friend.

Thank you. Is there a way to exchange my BTC for LTC or ETH, preferably inside of the Coinbase app? Is there a way to exchange the currency without fees if I am willing to wait a few days or whatever it takes?
Edit never mind I found multiple apps that will exchange the coin but I still have to send the BTC to the “exchange app” with the normal BTC transfer fee in order to get it done right?

I hope this question gets answered..
If I buy bitcoin from Coinbase and send it to another wallet such as the wallet in my “Blockchain” app the fee for sending is around $18. So my question is will there be another 18 dollar fee when sending the bitcoin out of the Blockchain wallet? In other words, am I looking at double fees if I tumble my bitcoin?

I sure am. That’s why I have questions.
