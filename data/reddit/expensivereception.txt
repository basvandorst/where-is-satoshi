Are you really naive enough to believe that this was all about unity? Everybody just wants to make a quick buck. The people shouting HODL or BUY are just trying to increase the price so they can cash out and make a fortune.

You're a scummy piece of shit. You want people to bring in their naive friends and family to pump so you can dump.

Giving money to charity is helping out the poor and misfortuned. Giving money to Bitcoin is helping millionaires who know more about stocks than you ever will to fatten their pockets.

At least I can buy lunch with my actual money. Enjoy having every bit of worth squeezed out of you by this pump and dump.

This is basically what's already happening. The problem is that the majority would jump ship and take their profits with them.
