Exactly, thanks.

You mean the blockchain, right?

End result is N pieces of paper any M of which can combine to create the seed. In the screenshots I made 7 pages, with three required to recover the seed. 
So now, I can scatter the pages amongst my family friends, cloud storage and safe deposit box. if any two sources are compromised my key will still be safe.
If my house burns down and I need to recover my wallet, I just need to find three people with a copy.

You can send a new transaction with a fee to basically doublespend the coin and invalidate the original transaction.

What the fuck? Can you post a link to that?

Well, that's depressing.

For reference, electrum will do this easily too.
I've recently written a guide which will help you set up fragmented backups for your private key I electrum too.

That would be possible to implement. I'm not sure if the benefit of being able to easily type the keys (if you don't have a webcam to scan the QR code) would outweigh the negatives. One of the key goals that I had when setting this up was to make use of existing tools as much as possible. I didn't want to get to a position where you had to have my program/script available to decrypt the fragments. 
Using the standard linux ssss implementation to handle the entire crypto process has a couple of very important benefits:
1. You don't have to trust me at all. 
2. You don't have to trust that any thing I've uploaded today will still be available for you when you need to restore your backups. 
Just to clarify for anyone else skimming above, the scripts that I've written just make it easier to print and validate the secrets generated by ssss-split. They don't have anything to do with the actual secret generation process. That is entirely handled by ssss which has been available since 2006 and isn't going anywhere.

He is such a fucking idiot. Using raid5 for key storage means that if an attacker compromises one key, your keyspace will be halved. Considering that ssss has been around for so long it seems reduculous that he wouldn't use that.

It doesn't say if it supports signing transactions or not.

Reddit is typically pro-science. The published science shows that at best, it's no better than placebo and at worst it can be harmful and in some cases fatal.

Man walks into a bar and pauses: at the other end of the bar, there's this guy with a big orange head. Just kind of sitting there, mooning into his drink. So the man asks the bartender, "Say, what's up with the guy with the big orange head?" And the bartender says, "It's an interesting story. Buy him a drink and maybe he'll tell it to you." 
So the man walks over and introduces himself and offers to buy a round. The guy with the big orange head says, "Yeah, I'll bet you want to know the story, huh?" To which the man replies, "Sure, if you don't mind." 
The man with the big orange head sighs and says, "You know, I've gone over it in my mind a million times. Basically, it's like this: I was walking along the beach one day, when I stubbed my toe on something. I looked down, and there was an antique brass lamp. I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out! 
"The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt. I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude.' 
The man at the bar is agape. The guy with the big orange head continues: "So I said, 'Wow, okay. Well, my first wish is to be fantastically wealthy.' 
"The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And all of a sudden I have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head, and my wallet is full of money and a dozen ATM cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills -- I mean, I was loaded! 
"So I said, 'Amazing! Okay, for my next wish , I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world.' 
"The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible. 
"The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'" 
The man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, "Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong. I wished for a big orange head.

Keep in mind that if this is Dorians brother, English is probably his second language. It sounds like he is making a joke about being humble and separatley complaining that this reporter is fucking with his brothers life.

No, its a 0.1% increase.

Do you have a source showing that it was well know to other researchers? The in bailiwick trust issue was well known but not thought to be a problem due to the probability of guessing the correct packet ID with your response before the real name server responded. His approach of combining the in bailiwick trust issue  with randomly generates subdomains was a novel and new.
