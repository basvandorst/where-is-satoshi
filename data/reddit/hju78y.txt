If "all your money" means money you have already set aside for long term savings, like retirement long term savings then you have something legitimate to discuss.  investing that money anywhere from 0% to 50% based on your age and what you are willing to lose is up to you. 
If "all your money" is money you need for rent and food and school, then no.

The keys are stored in the device, so it's different from an online wallet where you trust them with everything.  Full disclosure, I don't use a hardware wallet, so for your other question I'll refer you to the ledger knowledge base 
But yes, in theory you can recover to a different wallet.  I would want to practice it though if I thought I was going to use that feature.  Also, you have a very thought out and researched question in your post.  You might get a lot of traction  posting it to the bitcoin stackexchange.

I don't  know about that.  Darknet markets don't threaten an entire financial system.  You start messing with the money supply of the US political elite then you have a serious war on your hands.  It's coming, and the only safety net bitcoin will have are the politically connected, if any, with a financial stake.

With every run up in any commodity or thing of value there are always people to say "this time it's different, this time it's not going to fall"  It's never different.

Crony capitalism.  They are creating an advantaged space for a select group of friendly businesses.  Whatever their unnamed new entity is you can bet it's a private company that's paid for the access and wrote the legislation.

When it gets that high you won't care, because the last thing you'll want to do is sell for fiat.

Don't understate what government can do or what it can effectively destroy.  The key will be to get as many politicians with skin in the game as possible.  To get as much political money involved in bitcoin as possible.  We have make it hurt them to destroy it.

Has he considered maybe, bitcoin is bigger than reddit?  I hurt for the guy.  The utter confusion at bitxoin price movements is just sad.
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:26:28
Yes, but when bitxoin reaches it's peak you won't use fiat for that.  You'll use bitcoin.  Meaning you'll value bitcoin by what it buys, not what it's worth in fiat.

If you're looking for an off the shelf solution then you need a hardware wallet.  They are not storing your private keys and you should be able to recover in the event of a hardware failure with your seed phrase.  You will be trusting a third party, in a way, so go with a company that publishes their code, I believe that's Ledger.

Let's all not forget you can buy stuff with it too.  In the end, it is still money.  Instead of being concerned with exchanges and day trading the next step, after learning how to secure your wallet, should be learning how to integrate bitcoin into your regular savings and spending plan.  In fact, integrating bitcoin into daily spending and saving should be all our goals, if we want it to succeed.

Paranoia speaking here, but this is an attempt by government to collect and hold bitcoin.  They print the worthless stuff while they save the good stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:05:30
Do you ask this question before you contribute to your 401k?  I doubt it.  Point is, either you believe your making a sound investment based on your own research, or you don't.  Timing the market is gambling, and no one can help with that.

This is far from gambling.  if you've already bought bitcoin then you've already decided it's a good investment, and that the investment risk is acceptable for you.  Dollar cost averaging is a method that lowers the cost of ownership for an investment you already own and researched.  It's used across all types of assets and is considered a very conservative approach.  Gambling and investment risk are not the same.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:24:32
Well, if u do decide to sell can post here first so we can all jump in.

Don't sell.  Timing the market is a losing game.  It's no different than gambling, unless you have inside information.  You believed bitcoin was a good investment when you bought it and that has not changed.  
Whenever you think of selling, always consider why you bought it.  Ask yourself if any of the underlying qualities of your investment have changed, if not then it's not time to sell.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:34:09
This comment makes no sense to me.  This guys post has nothing to do with paying taxes.  We all know you have to pay taxes.  We all know you have to use fiat to pay taxes.  No one has said "don't pay taxes".  I don't know how you keep reading that into this post, and my comment.

So who does he think he's suing?  Just everyone I guess.

I didn't see him mention paying taxes.  I read voluntary transactions, which def does not include paying taxes.  I have to agree with him.  If I want to buy something from my neighbor and I want to use bitcoin, the Gov shouldn't have a say in that.

Welcome to the world of the taxpayer.  Even better, wait until you get a letter saying you mis calculated three years ago and you owe double what you originally paid, plus fees and interest, unless you can document and prove otherwise.  It's a fixed game.

I just went back through my emails to see what happened.  It took about 10 days to get it all done.  What I ended up doing was sending them the details of the last wire transfer I made into the account, and the details of the last trade I made.  As an extra thing, I also forwarded them their ticket conformation email containing details of the wire transfer.  After that, they sent me an unlock email.

I'm not sure I like the idea of connecting my wallet to a payment processor.  That would be like giving Mastercard access to my bank account.  I know some people do it, like with check cards, but I'm not all that enthusiastic about it.

How do bigger blocks = higher latency? Won't smaller blocks create a backlog, based on tx demand, and therefore create latency?
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:23:02
Good man, my earliest buy was at 75
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:15:13
Really, take a look at bitcoins price history.  It's nearly impossible to NOT have bought at an all time high.  Every person here has bought at least something at an ATH.  Market timing is a losing game.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:32:01
Beneath the debate on one side or the other I was missing the ideas driving each, so this helps.  
With bitcoin as a settlement layer, does that mean a lot of transactions will not be on the blockchain, but instead some aggregate of those tx?  For example,  say every person in the world uses bitcoin to buy dinner.  If every dinner tx is on the blockchain then there is a minimum size that's required, regardless of the size of the blocks used.  If the blocks are 1mb, then to accommodate you would have to hold tx in a queue until all blocks are processed or you combine them into some aggregate tx. How does this work when tx volume outstrips capacity.

@_date: 2017-07-17 03:09:21
How is it over if 51% signal seqwit?  I thought 80% was required for bip91.  Are you thinking 51 because with 51% bip148 would default to the longest chain?

What's your option 3 when your parents wise up and say gtfo.
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:16:07
I also think you can manually chose which server your electrum wallet gets its blockchain from, so you should have the ability to choose one that supports bip148, or some other fork, if necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:28:17
Doesn't the pow prevent this also?  Why waste all that energy on a pow only to load the block with worthless transactions, leaving time for your competitors to pick up the good transactions you've passed on.
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:49:46
I took that seriously for the first minute.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:08:57
That's a good point, I guess I would.  But along those lines, what is the argument against solutions like electrum, where I can point my wallet to a trusted node?  Even at a growth rate of 100 or 200gb/year I would expect a lot of people still capable of running nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:25:47
If it helps, I had 6k in litecoin with btce.  The account was inactive for 4 years.  I was sure there was no way I was getting it back, but eventually they reactivated my account and those coins are safely with me now.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:21:46
I don't get this.  Bitcoin ABC is now BCC?  Someone also please explain how this new coin gets off the ground.  No exchanges will carry it, and the majority of investment is behind bitcoin.  Also with bitmain supporting segwit2x, it doesn't look like there will be a chain split, except for this thing.  I just don't get the advantage in doing this.  Anyone?
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:04:28
There is a problem with using trusted nodes as electrum does?
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:59:55
If higher cost for running a node is due to a higher demand for bitcoin then isnt that inevitable, and positive, anyway?   I'm getting the impression that capping the blocksize is a way to force the blockchain into something like a settlement layer that not everyone interacts with directly.  Is that the intent?
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:23:05
Even with 51% signaling segwit isn't a split still possible?  With bip148 enforcing nodes at only 15% that doesn't make much of an incentive for the other miner's to switch, or for those signaling to switch.
