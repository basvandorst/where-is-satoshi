Jesus. I got a downvote before I was even finished writing the whole thing out. That's proof of your own irrationality. Haven't you ever been wrong before?

My child, you cannot fathom the warmth I feel in my heart when I witness your heartless, savage dissection of your fellow man's words. You have taken my lessons, and put them to exceptional use - Curiosity of the concealed, devotion to the discrete. 'Tis an act that pulls on my heart strings, but this is no time for emotions. You, my student, must do as I wish, and bring the enlightenment to others; for, if we do not scour the land that is reddit.com for infidels who say as the do not mean, then *all shall perish!* **ALL SHALL PERISH, CHILD! GO FORTH, AND SPREAD THE GOOD WORD THAT IS HIDDEN WORDS!**

One's ability (prowess) to speak on things is not proportional to their knowledge or experience of it! What I'm trying to say is that Bitcoin should be discussed by economists, financial experts, people with degrees in Business and Math, not people who are just opinionated. We need facts and certainty not emotions and opinions in this world, and Joe Rogan isn't qualified to deliver anything but the latter. Perhaps a strongman's generally uneducated emotions and opinions are what you seek - in that case, I accept your downvotes.
edit: you guys are stupid cunts
