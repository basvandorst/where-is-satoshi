One potential way to avoid long block confirmation delay during an inperson exchange would be to use a multi-sig wallet; in particular, a 2-of-2 wallet signed by both buyer and seller.  
If both parties pre-sign a tx in advance to refund the bitcoin 24 hrs after the meeting date/time, then the seller is safe to deposit their coins there before the meeting.  Buyer can then wait for the sellers deposit into the 2-of-2 multisig to be confirmed before traveling to meet the seller.
The seller can also pre-sign a tx paying the multisig to an address the buyer provides.  At the in person exchange, the sell gives the buyer their signature for this payout tx in exchange for the cash.  
The buyer can check the signature is valid before handing over the cash.   Because the seller needs the buyer to also sign, the seller can't double spend from the multisig ahead of the meeting.
The buyer only needs to combine the sellers signature with their own signature and get the payout tx into a block before the 24hr refund tx becomes valid.
A mobile app could make this easy using scanned QR codes.  Even with dodgy wifi, the buyer can confirm the signature from the seller is valid for the payout tx before handing over the cash.  This also eliminates man-in-the-middle attacks against the buyer.
Am I missing something here that would allow the seller to scam the buyer?
One other thing to consider regarding trust in these types of trades though is that the buyer really should come equipped to detect counterfeit currency.   Fiat cash is also subject to double spend attacks.

Even if the fiat transfer side is impossible to make anonymous, I think there is value to bitcoin trades being unlinked to each other.  All centralized exchanges (even LocalBitcoins) keep a history of trades linked to you.
With Bitsquare, all your bank ever sees are fiat transactions in and out - there is no central log that matches them to bitcoin transactions.  Anyone you trade with only knows the bitcoin transactions they were also involved in. 
The [recent Estonian bitcoin trader case]( provides a motivating example for why you might not want the history of your bitcoin trades to be linked.
Imagine a government hostile to bitcoin retroactively classifying the entire value of your bitcoin trades as taxable, not just the profit.  They could gather from centralized exchanges your trade volume and use it as evidence when computing your new tax bill.  
But if you sold your bitcoin on Bitsquare, then even in the unlikely case that one of your trades was with an undercover tax agent, they could only prove that that single transaction involved bitcoin.

I like Rusty Russell's description of the LN as a '[caching layer for bitcoin](
Key concept is that LN transactions are just bitcoin transactions that have, through cryptographic tricks, been safely cached to improve performance.  
This is similar to how your hard drive uses a memory cache to allow read/write operations to execute faster than if all operations had to always be individually finalized on the magnetic disk.

[bitsquare.io]( , like any other truly decentralized exchange, can not guarantee that you are anonymous - BUT they can help make sure no central point can monitor and control all transactions. 
If the counter party to my trade knows my name, and I know there name, then my trade was not anonymous, but it is safe from **ubiquitous** spying by companies and the government.

Do you think a history of small transactions for some period of time before making a large transaction would help?  After two months of small transactions it would be hard for them to assert any new transactions were from unauthorized access.
Sending a few cents and asking for the size seems like a good idea too, but we can assume the account thief has access to the account.  
The account might not even be stolen; it could just be the owner scamming you by telling his bank his account was hacked.

All seems totally feasible.  I even discussed getting paid in bitcoins with my driver last time I took Lyft to the airport and he seemed interested.  Insurance and vetting will be the biggest problem, as it is for Lyft and Uber now.
For example, what happens when a driver is sued by a client after an accident and the drivers insurance refuses to payout because they do not cover commercial uses.  
Some sort of umbrella insurance from the parent company will be required, and it would not be too different than what Lyft/Uber need to do now.  Only difference is it may have to payout in bitcoins if parent company is cut off from standard payment channels.

The Bitcoin Wiki [Smart Card Wallet]( page also mentions that Open PGP Card is based on [BasicCard]( which includes "RSA/EC and DES/AES coprocessors".   The most expensive BasicCard costs around 9 EUR.
Maybe you wouldn't trust millions to such a system, but I can imagine creating a very easy to use JavaME (PKCS app that could run on a low cost dual SIM feature phone with a smartcard based Bitcoin wallet built on BasicCard.    
A signed TX should fit into two 160 character SMS messages that could be sent to a gateway (by the normal phone SIM) to be placed on the internet.  It's not fully decentralized, but not everyone can afford a smartphone with internet access.  The receiving party would have to also rely on a gateway to notify them via SMS when a bitcoin payment is received.   
Of course the gateways need not be centralized either.  The SMS gateway can be your uncle who has his phone hooked to wifi at an internet cafe in the city.

Perhaps we need to create our own convention for a code word to use when referring to bitcoins in a bank transaction.  I suggest "gift(s) from Satoshi".  For example, in your memo you write, "For 3.1415 gifts from Satoshi"  instead of "For 3.1415 Bitcoins."  
More seriously, always use the currency symbol BTC instead of Bitcoin because it's vague enough to refer to someone's initials.

I would expect merchants accepting payment to be more likely to have some sort of internet access or gateway node arrangement.  What I am describing is sort of like the payment protocol where the payment tx created by the buyer is sent to the merchant's selected bitcoin node.  This node will put it on the blockchain and notify the merchant that it confirmed on the network and valid.
Imagine a customized [payment protocol]( running over SMS between feature phones.  The merchant would have to trust the gateway and probably pay a fee for their services.  
The buyer might also want to have a gateway they trust configured to notify them when payments confirmed on the network from their address so the merchant can't rip them off by claiming the tx was invalid.

Until it becomes illegal for two people to exchange fiat then person-to-person decentralized solutions are possible.  The devil is in the details, and it may not be a drop in replacement for bitstamp or mt.gox but it is possible.

@_date: 2015-01-05 16:25:11
A p2p exchange is probably too complex for first-time buyers right now,  but solutions can be found down the road when more people are using the system.  For example, arbitrators could decide to provide pro-bono arbitration for small value trades to help first-time buyers.  
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:21:46

@_date: 2015-01-22 18:21:35
In a nutshell: Using the Bitsquare trade protocol, you and your counterparty fund a multisig (2 of 3) bitcoin address with a security deposit.  The fiat is sent directly to the bitcoin seller via a fiat payment system you agree to upfront (similar to LocalBitcoins).   
If all goes well, both buyer and seller sign the multisig transaction that refunds the security deposits and transfers the bitcoin to the buyer.
In the case of a dispute, the arbitrator becomes involved to refund, or forward payment of bitcoins using their 3rd signature.  They are paid for their services from the security deposit of the party who violated the trade protocol.

@_date: 2015-01-05 16:36:21
Both approaches use a security deposit and neither approach is ideal for new users right now.  I think in the future you'll see trades for small amounts become possible without needing any bitcoin upfront, but new users are not the first target market for a p2p exchange.

Perhaps person-to-person (p2p) is a better way to think about decentralized exchanges.  
A decentralized exchange is just people with software on their computers that lets them find other people who want to trade fiat for bitcoin, agree on a price, execute the settlement and (if needed) arbitrate any disputes.   
There is no single buyer, seller, bank or arbitration provider - this makes it decentralized because there are no single points of failure.
The goal is not to exactly replace traditional exchanges, but to find a robust protocol for p2p exchanges.

I think this is a very interesting idea and glad to see someone giving it a try.  
Something like [Popcorn Time]( but with a reward to seed would be handy.   Like PT, please be ready to open source it if/when the MPAA lawyers show up at your door.
Last time I looked into this it seemed like the bittorrent community was generally against financial incentives to seed.  There are some good arguments for this point of view, but I still think it's worth trying.

Even if a government manages to close down the centralized exchanges it will be harder to stop decentralized exchange options like [Bitsquare]( and others.  LocalBitcoins is less centralized then other options, but can still be shut down (eg. [in Germany](

The bridge from bitcoin to fiat is a critical element for this kind of project.  Merchants would need to exchange bitcoin for fiat to pay for goods and salaries.  
However, instead of one single way to do that, in this kind of system there could be multiple types of cash agent adapted for the particular region and situation.  
Key is that these agents do not need to be trusted or vetted in advance.  The permissionless innovation aspect of bitcoin when applied to cash agents enables rapid deployment and adaptability.

One thing to keep in mind is that unlike Greece, Cyprus or Italy, Sweden has a well functioning tax collection regime and does not need to raid your bank account to raise cash to bail out the banks.  
People pay very high taxes on goods, services and income; they can be counted on to pay more in the case of a crisis.  
Being cashless helps Skatteverket take their pound of flesh each month, but it is not the only mechanism for enforcing compliance.

["Former NSA intelligence agent raises nearly $1 million to build "Bonafide reputation system" to track, monitor, identify, and rate individual Bitcoin addresses."](
Let this be a warning to all investors who invest in technology that seeks to compromise the permissionless or pseudonymous aspects of Bitcoin.

I would put emphasis on the need for more face-to-face meetings.  I've worked with various (non-technology, offline) communities and found that the tone of discourse between warring factions improves when people have worked or socialized together in person.  They may still disagree, but do so in a more polite and constructive way.  
There is the added benefit that shills and trolls can not act to easily disrupt informal workshops or social gatherings.

This is a very important project for enabling real world uses of bitcoin.
I think there are some low hanging fruit escrow situations where bitcoin and smart contracts could add value pretty quickly.  
One example is the sale of high end used cars.  Take a look at [escrow.com](  
Used cars are a good template for the kind of escrow markets that could be decentralized.  Bitcoin can also facilitate international sales.  
A robust system of smart contract powered mediation could make robust mediation affordable and ubiquitous.

Interesting - I was not following Sweden too closely in '94, but I do agree that philosophically the Swedish government is a kleptocracy of the first order.  
Pension funds are soft targets because you can't move out of them easily.
I stand by my main point though, which is that Sweden is different than Greece, Cyprus and Italy because it has a strong tax collection system and small black market economy.  
It is insane that people support a government that taxes them so excessively, but enough do to keep them elected.
I'd love to understand why they support the level of taxation they do now.  I honestly can't understand it.

Taxi cab drivers, or even better Uber drivers, would be ideal for this.  They could supply the ride to the hotel and exchange some bitcoins for fiat.  I would certainly tip well for such a combined service.

The bitcoin seller is not anonymous, but the buyer who is buying with cash is anonymous.  Short of an in person, buttonwood style, trade you are not going to be able to get paid with fiat anonymously.
I think this is a good idea, though you do need to trust the site owners to hold your bitcoins safely.
