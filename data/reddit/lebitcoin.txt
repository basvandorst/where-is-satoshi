Is this sarcasm? Everyone on this platform starts with 0.0 feedback points. 
Just try it.

if your skeptic from the start better avoid using them. It's very hard to get money into btc-e. Many prefer to transfer btc directly instead of depositing fiat money.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:13:53
like you wrote: that's the fee (minimum 20$). It's an international wire transfer to Deutsche Bank in Czech Republic for a London based company.

It will crash when people realise they cannot buy stuff with bitcoins. Thus it is utterly important that bitcoins are traded for goods. As long as this is provided via markets like Silk Road or new markets (auction houses, ebay, amazon accepting bitcoins) everything will be good.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:00:55
why is that?
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:07:35
If you find enough referrals it would pay out. But in this case, they do not pay out :(
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:29:53
scam alert
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:15:35
and do you know how fast btc-e is?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:38:26
for the lazys
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:01:51
the referral  link is not working. the site is down.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:23:22
this post should be higher up. and we also need a similar thread for other exchange markets.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:28
me, too. My first thought was "no it's just a minor correction, just hold and see". Then I sold at the bottom .... :(
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:34:46
About 21Mega Bitcoins are available to roughly 3Giga People (number of internet users estimated).
So thats 21 over 3 times (Mega over Giga) = 6.6e-3  bitcoins per internet user. Now think that each internet user has a purchasing power of (estimated) 500$.  That means 0.006 Bitcoin can correspond to 500$. It corresponds to an exchange rate of 83,333.00$ per Bitcoin. 
Now if you think the average purchase power of the average internet user is higher, good for you :)  It's not too late :)
Edit: typo 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:30
for the lazy ones.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:30:21
you can sell.
It's a bitcoin market. You can sell, buy, send and receive with this wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:48:24
why does it differ for selling EUR?
Is gox just problematic for US based users?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:44:25
do not use btc-e many have problems with using them! they have much higher fees than any other exchange market.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:08:39
I am getting 404 when I try to buy or sell coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:24:41
It's just not going to crash. When will people realize that bitcoins have already reached a point of no return for a lot of investors. As long as the silk road and other markets using bitcoins go on trading, the bitcoin won't devaluate.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:42:52
What can change bitcoins going up and up? As long as silk road 2.0 is using bitcoins, nothing will change.

is this also true for OKPAY.com? any experience? I am trying it, but I am stuck in the verification process of OKPAY.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:21:41
see here:
 
OP wants to transfer fiat to bitcoin and then withdraw to fiat. 
btc-e is not the right place for that. For trading it's  alright (low trade fee).
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:17:25
Thank you so much for the explanation!
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:20:52
I use them. I had to validate by using a SEPA transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:34:10
just roll there and get your first coins so you can have something to show in your first wallet while still trying things out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:31:40
Has anyone tried the first method on ebay? Make an auction and then offer to pay via bitcoin for the Bitstamp exchange rate at DAY/Time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:13
How much fees did you pay in total? Could you give the absolute numbers?
I heard that OKPay is a rip off.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:28:33
Thank you for sharing this information. I was also considering using OKPay but now it's done. I will omit them.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:25:20
I'll give an update on the post once the coins show up in my wallet. Thanks for the information that it takes that long actually.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:11:45




well that would mean we find quantum computation. The protocol of bitcoin is based on Public Key Encryption, which is well studied. Only quantum computers can break crypto-currencies. 
I  agree on the other points, though.


I do agree on the minor effect of Silk road for the value of bitcoin. Yet, I do believe that whithout an active market where people trade, no coin will hold for long. Right now when the late-adopters buy coins, they are giving those coins trust and value. But when people realize that bitcoins solely as an investment do not work, the active market will be the only price maker.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:36:27
bitstamp is at 500$ and MtGox at 600$

I received another payment on the 2nd of December. It might be that you need to be a member  for a full week. Alternatively you might consider writing directly to the site owner.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:22:21
right now bitstamp is hardly working for newcomers.
it takes a lot of time for verification. without verification you cannot trade.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:47:32
The site seems to create and sort the keys by their private key value.
Bitcoin would be hacked if you could look up any private key by specifiying a public key only. As long as this is not possible.... dream on.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:30:03
try bitcoin.de 
they do not require a photo ID.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:18:57
wow, that was fast. Just right after my post, my pay-out shows as pending in their profile view. Perhaps they should provide this information in the FAQ. I waited 8 hours before posting this thought about a scam to reddit, just to be sure it's not related to cronjobs ot whatever automation service.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:48:22
You can find out, if you create an account. It's still free and only takes a few clicks. But there seems no serious way to deposit money. 
payeer.com (5%)
okpay (2%)
International wire transfer to "Mayzus Financial Services Ltd" with horribly high costs
perfectmoney (5%)
I added the fees for some of the funding services in brackets.

I predict $50k in the next 20 months.
