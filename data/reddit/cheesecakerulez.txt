It is hard. Have you seen the [Cardano whiteboard]( It's good to be diversified, and you joke, but it's hard to imagine dogecoin being part of anyone's serious portfolio.

This is really effing awesome. I think it would be great to be able to zoom in and out. In general, a bigger perspective as far as the amount you can see. They drift out of view too soon sort of. Not sure how to explain it.
A site could be set up made for this, allowing you to view other cryptos too.

I've only done two trades there. ETH to BTC then BTC to ADA. Yep the fees are pretty low. I'd say it's one of the top exchanges right now without any problems. I've seen people talking about how good it is so tried it out and it's been great so far. I used to love Bittrex (another good one) but they seem to be having problems lately, and the UI isn't as good.

Cardano from $0.40 to $2.5 within 2-3 years.

Do you know how not-in-debt I'd be right now if I had done that? But alas, I probably would've sold the shit as soon as it reached what I thought was a high, not long after that.
I believe it's going to be double/triple what it is now by the end of 2018 but who knows what the hell happens. I guess if it's a grant then it's certainly not as bad an idea as doing it with a loan.

Same here, but straight from Ledger's website, including shipping. I'd rather not buy from a third party for cheaper.

I think Ethereum will continue improving and stay ahead, but you can never be sure. By 'where Ethereum is' I'm mainly referring to it's current market cap and popularity, as long as Cardano does what it says it's going to do. It's a 2-3 year hold as it takes a long time to develop - don't forget ETH came out of nowhere this year. There seems to be a good team behind ADA. My portfolio currently looks like 90% ETH and 2% ADA with coins in between.

Don't forget about Cardano. I think it's a pretty safe bet it'll be close to where Ethereum is within two years.

Have you looked at [Binance]( They have a great trading interface.

I bought last week directly from Ledger's site. Shipping ended up being like $20, but $95 total. Instead of buying from a 3rd party.

Centralized blockchains have a lot to gain over current system: 
Makes it even more efficient at being a fractional reserve system than it currently is. Need to inject money into the economy? No problem, just do an airdrop directly to 350 million citizens, instantly.

Blockchain technology doesn't have to be decentralized, nor does cryptocurrency. They can be both be either decentralized or centralized.

Well now I feel dumb. I remember knowing it was traded offline, but it completely slipped my mind. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:27:51
I've wondered this as well. How is the price/market cap calculated? Does it include unverified transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:20:48
How long did it take for identity verification? I'm currently waiting.

Very noice!

Cool, I knew it would take awhile so I was just wondering what others have experienced.
I went ahead and bought $500 of ether @ $147 yesterday through Coinbase. The fee was $7.45 via bank transfer. What would it be on Gemini if you wanted to buy right now?

When you want to withdraw bitcoin, you can withdraw it to any Bitcoin address, including the receive address that exchanges give you to send bitcoin when you want to deposit.
What I usually do is withdraw it to my Bitcoin wallet that's on my computer, then send it to the exchange. But it takes a long time, and the fees are high at the moment.

Have an up-vote over there.
I was watching it on GDAX steadily climb (it hit just above $2,800), then saw the the first beg red, followed by the second. It wasn't until about an hour later when I came across the article. Makes you wonder.

I wouldn't buy right now. One of the good things about big, fast rises like this is it tells you one thing: It'll more than likely take a significant dip. Just go back and look at all the tops. It really depends on how fast the rise is and how much it gained. It rose more slower this time than the last, so the dip may be less intense.
Don't listen to me, but I'd set a limit order at $2,500 and just be patient. The last drop was at below $2,000, and a lot of people had to buy a lot of bitcoin for us to be back to $2,850. People will be looking to realize gains. That's what I'd do, but don't listen to me. No one knows what will happen.

Whew, I know that filling. Glad your coins are safe-r.
Thanks for the warning!

Just so you know, I'm bad at trading, but I'm learning.
Something that I find really odd is how calm ETH has been during the huge BTC price movement. If a significant sale off of BTC happens, I could see these people putting their proceeds into ETH to pump it up. It's just now started rising out of its side-ways movement.
Take a look.
