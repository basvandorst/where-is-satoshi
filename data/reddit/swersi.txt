Are you sure it's cumulative?  [The Verge]( reported that it was $20k in a single year between 2013-2015.

Can you withdrawal via wire (not bank ACH)?  A wire to your bank account may be less of a red flag than a large ACH transfer. Plus, ACH is typically very limited. Look at Gemini as a possibility - if I recall, there is no limit on wire withdrawals.
Re taxes, if you're in the U.S., then I think you have the right idea about capital gains. Claim zero as your basis and just be ready to provide it's not a short-term gain. As long as you can do those things, you should be fine.

Just read about the IRS sending letters. I assume they got their list of people from Coinbase (people between 2013-2015 who bought or sold more than $20k). 
If someone made purchases in bitcoin but never sold for fiat, that's still a taxable event in the US. However, how can the IRS prove the person made a bitcoin purchase? It's easy to prove conversion to fiat because of bank records, but how would the IRS prove a bitcoin to bitcoin transfer was a transaction (unless they knew the recipient was a merchant)?

I have a question about Bisq. From the introduction on their webpage, they write:
*You take an existing offer, agreeing to buy the seller’s BTC for your USD
*You send USD from your bank to the seller’s bank and indicate you have done so in Bisq
*You and the seller wait for your USD payment to arrive at the seller’s bank
If you are sending money directly from your bank to the seller's bank, won't your name or some variation of your identity show up in the seller's bank transfer note ("transfer from John Doe, XYZ bank")?

Did you purchase above the $20k threshold? Is that why you got a letter?

What state do you live in?

What state do you live in?  Did you receive a 1099-k in 2017? Coinbase is required to submit a 1099-k for anyone with over 200 trades or $20k value; however, that threshold is much lower in some states. See [this link]( for more information. 
If you don't fall within one of those listed in the link above, then it could be that the IRS is automatically sending this notice because you filed trading activity with them. 
Keep in mind the IRS is severely under-resourced. They do not have a good method for sending these letters. You're almost certainly not being targeted - they are just using a blanket method to send these letters to as many people as they have on record.

This confuses me. I thought the letters were only directed at those given up by Coinbase from the 2013-2015 timeframe. This is the only thread I've seen that includes other people who received letters. I wonder if they are lying or shills for a CPA product.
Edit: actually, Coinbase [files a 1099-k]( under certain circumstances, which I bet led to these guys getting a letter.  Once the IRS has a 1099-k on file, they know you were involved with crypto.
