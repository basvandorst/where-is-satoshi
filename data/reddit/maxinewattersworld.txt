i'm not scared to give personal information to a bank or other financial institution.
but if a bank or financial institution has no phone number, and only can be contacted by email or through a reddit page, then hell no!
i am not doing business with them
look on here, and other crypto asset subreddits, there are literally hundreds (perhaps more) people who lost their money, and who cant get an exchange to fix it, or even reply to them about it ...and they are left to do nothing but complain about it on reddit.
on the other hand, if somehow a fiat bank lost thousand of my dollars, i could just call them, talk to a human being and straighten it out.
so yeah... thats a big difference
until exchanges have actual customer service and tech support that you can get ahold of in cases of major problems or missing funds, then they will be considered an untrustworthy joke (and rightly so)
if you don't get that, you must be a child still in high school, with no actual real world financial experience.
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:51:12
this is why people trust real banks over crypto exchanges
Sure, real banks have online support,
but... when there is an actual issue, a real fiat bank has a phone number and a human being you can talk to.
AND YES.. I AM AWARE OF THE MANY ISSUES WITH REAL BANKS, AND I AM NOT DEFENDING THEM IN MOST CASES, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO BE REACHED, THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN THOSE EXCHANCES THAT WONT EVEN LET YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS.
until crypto business (exchanges but also cold storage like ledger, etc) allow you to talk to a human being, crypto will be considered unsafe and a joke.
i don't know how many times i have to say this, but if a company does not have a human being you can talk to by calling them, when YOU want to call them, then do not do business with them.

with all due respect, what makes you think that you have any opinion or rights to tell someone else how to spend their own money?
if they want to spend it to mine bitcoin, and they are paying for the energy to do that themselves, then its not really any of your business.
and if someone wants to spend their own money to pay for energy costs to mine gold, thats none of your business either.
use as much or as little energy as you wish to, and allow others the same freedom to buy and use as much as they want to as well.
this whole idea that people can go around telling others how much energy they can buy with their own money is nonsense, and i don't want to hear it anymore.
...or, as people used to say "mind your OWN business" and "Live and Let Live"

OK, thats your opinion, I see.  Here, have an upvote for expressing your opinion, I appreciate that! Personally, someone simply having a different opinion, as long as its expressed politely, does not annoy me.   Anyway, I prefer that people don't get permanently banned with no reason given, but thats just me.  Both of our opinions about this matter are valid, I guess.  And just because one mod did something like that, doesnt mean ALL the mods are bad, either!
Anyway, I didn't come hear to talk about the specifics of this event.  Its interesting to me at the moment, but ultimately, i don't really care that much.  I just came on here, and decided to post for the first time today because I wanted to warn anyone else who had a bearish opinion that they could get banned if they express it on here, thats all!
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:56:07
i'm not dumb
I jut prefer to do business with companies that I can got ahold of in the case that something goes wrong.
if nothing goes wrong, it doesnt really matter if they can be reached.
but if something does go wrong, or if there is a real problem, then its no good if the company can only be reached by email or by their reddit page.
But giving ALL my personal information and thousands of dollars in assets to a company that I cannot even contact directly? and that won't even let me know what their phone number is?  Naw, I'll pass on that, thank you very much.
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:43:04
yes, early adopters were important to the adoption, use and implementation of bitcoin
no doubt.
I wasn't saying that such a shift was bad (i honestly do not know, or even pretend to know), or that I knew whether such a shift was a  good or bad thing overall.
i was mainly just saying that an interesting potential aspect of the shift to the possibility of a bitcoin based world currency.
I guess, if it comes to be, we'll just have to see it play out, and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:05:00
yes, good example
he was pointing out that he thought the rally was a foolish one, and he thinks those millions of invesrors worldwide who bought into it are foolish (as, in his opinion, the current bitcoin market is overly manipulated by whales, tech billionaires and insider-trading-excanges) but even as he says that... he does not personally insult any member of r/bitcoin, nor does he call any person on here a name or insult them.
thanks for the great example, take my upvote

i'm not ghee
although, speaking of that person, its interesting.
he was banned in late August for being super bearish, and for saying that bitcoin was going to crash hard by September
so... yes, his prediction of a hard crash was a few days early, but he was the most accurate one of all.
Poor guy, he is banned, but when you look at the price of bitcoin this week, I guess he is having the last laugh, after all.

wise comment
be careful though
there are certain mods on here who will ban permanently, anyone who is bearish (i.e, honest) about bitcoin
happened to a friend of mine named u/ghee99

right now
best thing to do, if youre daring...
sell all your btc now
buy bitcoin in a few months when its worth 4K
you can almost double your btc in a few months if you do that
but yes, there is a slight risk involved, as its possible (extremely unlikely, but possible) that bitcoin will go up again in 2018

Serious Question, please no "bits".  Serious answers only (PLEASE).
I bought btc in nov &amp; dec 2017
since then I've been watching the price, and following how its doing.
there have been little up-ticks, but mainly it just goes down.  when will this end?  its just seems to be endlessly less and less.  I keep hearing it will never go below $10K, then $9K, then it will never go below $6.5K, now i hear it will never go below $6K (some are even saying that $5K is the botton, and it will never go below that)  - but honestly I don't know.  I just want it to 1.) stop going down 2.) start going up.
what do you all think?  Will it go back up?  and if so, when?
I'm soooooo tired of HODLing an asset that only has lost value since I bought it.  ANYONE know when it will go up again?  I know no one will have an exact date, but if someone has a general idea, and can share it, it will be great appreciated, thanks!

Thanks for the input, take an upvote.  as for you saying he was spamming? he was?  I looked at his comments, I didn't see one solicitation, or one bit of spam.  Just generally bearish comments on bitcoin, NO personal insults of other users, ever (even when they personally insulted him) and he was always super clear that he was not an expert, and that what he said was ONLY his opinion.  And yet, many others who did engage in personal insults, and who were actually rude to people did not get banned, but he did.  weird, right?
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:35:33
hey, whatever the case take an upvote from me, and remember... its not cool (i think) to ban people (who follow the rules) just because they were bearish.

this is r/bitcoin, so shut the fuck up with your political hatred, if you want to talk and insult based on politics, go somewhere else, but r/bitoin is where we talk about bitcoin and crypto, and it is not the place for your angry politic insults

and so what if it uses a lot of energy?
those anti crypto people need to mind their own business.
there is no shortage of energy (oil, coal, natural gas, wind, solar, geo-thermal, hydro-electric, nuclear etc, etc, etc)
there is more than enough energy on planet earth, in various forms, to keep crypto mining going until the end of time.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:34:24


I agree
i think most of us are open to a range of opinions
sadly, it only taken one mod who doesnt like negative opinions to ban someone forever for having a nagative opinion
there is no way to appeal.  so, thats the main reason there are almost zero negative opinions on here anymore
they are just users who are "erased" from here, forever.
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:02:16
wait, so youre saying ALL bitcoin needs is for one group to buy a billion dollars worth of bitcoin, and then it will be fine?
hey, I hope someone does spend a billion on bitcoin, but if thats the only thing that will make value go up, i am not that optimistic.  I mean, financial managers of pensions would rather earn slow and steady as opposed to taking big risks (even if there is a possibility of a big payoff).  As such, finding a pension fund that will put a billion into an asset class that has lost 70% of its value in the last 9 months is not very likely (even if that asset looks like it might recover those losses, and more).  Thats just not how pension fund managers operate (at least not in my understanding of large institutional fund managers)

first of all, take an upvote, i always love to hear someone else's opinion, and learn from them!
as for...


Just thinking, but, if someone is aggravated by a bearish opinion, thats on them not the person who has the opinion?   as for the other stuff, no...i looked he never baited or even insulted anyone on here, ever that i saw.
and yes, you are right, some people (even a mod) can look at something, and not see it objectively.
I guess there was at least one mod who was upset that anyone had a bearish opinion on bitcoin, no matter how politely they expressed it.  Oh well... I guess there is unfairness everywhere.
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:45:48
ok, thats cool that we can mine bitcoin with non-carbon energy energy sources, but why?
we have plenty of carbon fuel sources still, and carbon and nuclear are WAY cheaper.  I mean, why use a much more expensive power source when we have plenty of fossil fuels still left.
Sure, one day we can just use non-carbon fuels, when they figure it out how to make it cheaper than carbon based energy, but until them we should use whats cheapest, and then only change when we run out of carbon fuels (or when we can make non-carbon fuels cheaper)
but purposefully use more expensive energy sources?  that sounds like the worst business plan ever 
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:51:09

and all the personal insults that are hurled, and the one guy who never personally insulted any one of us is banned forever, with no chance to even know why, or come back

It could be worse
You could have a random mod just decide they don't like you (for no other reason than because you were bearish on bitcoin).
and woosh! just like that you would be banned forever, no appeal allowed, or reason given.  Just "erased" from r/bitcoin forever.
Thats what happened to u/ghee99  
May he R.I.P.
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:34:00

apparently, the mods are banning any accounts lately that express a bearish opinion on bitcoin
have you noticed, there are almost zero bearish opinions on bitcoin on here any more?
wonder why?
because those who express bearish opinions on bitcoin are getting permanently banned off of here.

@_date: 2018-09-05 00:22:13
Did you hear?
there was a user on here, he (or she?) was polite to everyone, but they were bearish on bitcoin
and guess what happened?
for nothing other than expressing a bearish opinion on bitcoin they are permanently banned.
YES, IT IS TRUE.
Anyway, many called this fellow r/bitcoin user name and insults, and this user NEVER insulted anyone back personally ...not ever!
but, simply saying that they thought bitcoin was going down in price they were banned from here forever.
I talked to them, off of reddit, and they said when they wrote the mods, there was no reply, even.
So, just consider this as a warning.
if you say anything negative about the price of bitcoin, you could get BANNED from here, forever.
No chance to ever come back.
JUST BE WARNED and BE CAREFUL what you write (people are watching, and certain ideas are not to be expressed).
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:11:33
oh, i know u/ghee99
not in real life, but we are online "friends"
he was the one who introduced me to r/bitcoin (after we "met" on another sub)
so, i do know for a fact, 100% that he was banned from r/bitcoin
and he says it was for being bearish (thats his guess anyway, he was just banned, no reason given, and he is blocked from messaging the mods, so he cant even ask why)
but, looking at his past posts, he made some predictions that didn't come true, then again, he did always say he was not an expert, and that it was just his opinion
he was always 100% polite, and never insulted any fellow users of r/bitcoin (even though there were those who called him names or used insults towards him)
basically, there is nothing that he did that ever broke any rule of this subreddit, ever
but, he was banned, and there is no way for him to even know why?
or even ask.
so, i can only guess as to the reason why, it just sucks that there seems to be a mod that is going around censoring users with any bearish opinions on here
(and from what i can tell, it seems like there are a bunch of other posters that were bearish, that are now also banned ...or who are mysteriously gone all of a sudden.)

As i have said so many times before
if you choose to do business with a bank, exchange or other financial institution that doesnt even have a phone number you can call
then you pretty much deserve what you get.
i mean seriously... a financial institution that won't even tell you what their phone number is clearly doesnt give a fuck about you
i mean, they are like "give us thousands and thousand of your dollars, and hey... if you have a problem, you can email us"
fuck that!
c'mon, use your brain, any one who wants to "hold your money" but won't even let you call them is not a company you should ever trust.
you can complain about them (and hey, it sounds like they suck) but most of the blame belongs on you, as you were the one foolish enough to trust them.  
you should have known better, and i am hoping you do now.

well, i cant speak for all who "disappear"
but I do know why at least one user from here has been "disappeared"
I am referring to a user called u/ghee99 . he certainly was bearish on bitcoin (i know we are talking about a few "missing" members, in this post I am talking about u/ghee99). But he was always 100% polite, he never personally insulted any fellow user of r/bitcoin, ever, and he made a point to always say he lost money (which is why he was bearish), that he wasn't an expert in any sense, and that he HOPED it would go up - even if he was pessimistic about that happening and everything he said was not fact, but just his opinions.
and hey, he did warn people about the dangers of getting caught up in the hype, and buying a bunch of bitcoin in a time of high expectations. thats what happened to thousands of people in dec 2017 and jan 2018, and those people lost up to 70% of their money. So i was glad to see someone talking about such things, and not have it be all just "to the moon" and "lambo"
So yeah.. it kinda sucks that someone who was super polite and followed all the rules just gets banned for having a bearish outlook on bitcoin.
Oh well, i guess the new way is that ONLY positive opinions on bitcoin are allowed (and otherwise, anyone who is consistently bearish will get permanently banned forever, no reason given, or appeal allowed)
Anyway, thats at least one reason why anyone who was previously bearish on bitcoin, might now be gone, as they might have been "erased".

I think we're talking about the same person (u/ghee99)
although, in his case he wasn't "bullish" he was bearish.
I "know" this person from other subreddits, although it was this person who introduced me to r/bitcoin a while back.  So I would follow his posts on here.  When he was permanently banned on here, i was like WTF!?
I had never posted on here before today, but when he showed me the message he got saying he was banned forever with no real reason given, I figured I'd say something.  I mean, someone can be annoyed that another user is bearish, and not like his "attitude".
Plus, he told me (and I have no reason to think he'd lie to me) that he contacted the mods all week, and they never ever replied to him.  Just stone cold baked forever, no appeal allowed, or reply given.
If all someone does is politely express an opinion, for some random mod to ban him is just super lame (to say the least).  
I don't post on here (in the past) and I have never posted before today, so i don't really care if I get banned just for sharing my opinion and sticking up for an online "friend".  Mainly, I did just want to let everyone on here know what was going on.   Like I said, I have been a lurker on here for a few months, and noticed that there are less and less bearish comments, so I just wonder if ALL non-positive posters are being permanently banned by a rogue r/bitcoin mods or a few rogue mods working together?
Whatever the case, I just wanted to say "be careful what you say, if its not positive towards bitcoin, you could get banned for good, and for ever."

Yes, but they all have created something
and their wealth enriches others, too.
for example, bill gates or jeff bezos (like them or not) didn't get rich without enriching literally millions of other people along the way.
and yes... satoshi himself (themselves?) did create something that enriched others, the same can not be said of many of the others who will control large portions of the world's wealth for nothing other than having been an early adopter.  
Not saying this is a good or a bad thing, but if bitcoin were to become the world's default currency, it would be a huge shift in world power (from those that control the world's wealth now, to those who have the most bitcoin).
Would this be good for the world as a whole, or a bad thing.  Until (if?) it happens, we won't know for sure.  But youre right, its certainly an interesting potential aspect of a shift to a bitcoin based world currency.

funniest comment on here,
i'm laughing through my tears,
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:01:27


No, I read everything he wrote on here, at least everything the last couple of months, he NEVER said he was trolling.  In fact, he did say (over and over)  that he was not an expert, and that what he said was ONLY his opinion.  And also, he NEVER personally insulted his fellow r/bitcoin users.  And yet, many who did personally insult him are still here, and he is banned forever.  thats kinda weird, right?
well, thats my thoughts, but thanks for your thoughts, take an upvote from  me for sharing your mind!
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:13:37
i am neither confirming nor denying.
but you bring up an interesting point...
if what reminds people of u/ghee99 is that I sound gentle and polite,
that kinda makes it even more odd that he was banned forever.
I guess, he was banned for being bearish on bitcoin after all?
oh well... the mods won't even reply to u/ghee99 (or so i hear)
so perhaps, we'll never ever know?
Either way, i thank you for your opinion, and for sharing your thoughts, please take my upvote, good sir!

ah, i see...
i don't know much about 4chan, although in the past, i did have someone show me some of their practical jokes that came from the /pol message board on 4chan.  The "trick the normies into thinking that the OK symbol is a secret racist code" was a pretty awesome practical joke (and it seems to have worked on gullible liberal members of the public), and they had a great "theory" about how Donald Trump was a time traveler, that was awesome/funny.
so, i'm very limited in visiting 4chan, but most of what i saw what funny (although, there was some occasional racism that was not my style).
Anyway... thanks for filling me in on what those terms were (/b, and sminem and bogged, bogdanoff twins, etc).

yes, apparently anyone who is not positive and bullish on bitcoin, gets permanently banned forever, no appeal or explanation
just gone, and fully banned forever (or at least that is what i have heard).
so, thats why you no longer see almost ANY negative comments about bitcoin anymore, even when things are bad (at least, that is my own personal theory, i cant say I know for sure).
Positive comments, to the moon, HODL only and lambo comments exclusively (might be the only types of comments allowed these days?)
but bearish comments = banned forever! (is what i have been told)
anyway, i am not saying its right or wrong to do so, just letting you know (a possible theory) as to why you haven't seen certain people lately, they (it seems) have been "erased"

i'm not tired of HODLing, i am tired of losing value.  I know thats all part of being an investor in anything, i was just curious if anyone had a good solid idea of when btc would stop hemorrhaging value, and start going up again in a big way.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:51:10


if you are referring to u/ghee99 ?
he never called anyone that was a member of r/bitcoin a name, nor did he personally insult any fellow members of r/Bitcoin
he never broke any of the rules of r/Bitcoin
and yet, he was banned (with no warning given, or chance to do anything about whatever bothered the upset mod, or even any ability to contact any mod after it happened)
he was jut banned, no warning, and forever, never allowed to post onto r/bitcoin again
Oh well.... I guess thats the new way, you just get banned forever, no warning or reason, and then woosh! you are "disappeared" for ever.
no rules broken, and no other users can know why either.
SO, be careful out there, ans it seems like ther is some kind of purge going on by some mod (which one, we do not know)???
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:25:08
Oh, I never meant to imply that you were a troll.  I don't think that at all. And yes, I agree when you say 


But in the case of this banned user, he never said it will for sure, he just said his opinion, and was quite clear that it was only his personal opinion.
I am actually not bearish, either.  Although, if someone else wants to hold a bearish opinion and say so, I don't think that should get them banned!
I just didn't like seeing how a fellow bitcoin user, who never said even one impolite thing, and who just expressed an opinion in a decent manner was permanently banished from this community.
I have not been on here that long, but I did always think that r/bitcoin seemed open to all ideas, as long as they were expressed politely.  Sadly, that seems to have changed, and now (It would appear) that only bullish opinions will be allowed on here.  And that change on here, seems like a change for the worse.

but having to ask random strangers for help is not good support!

oh well... i guess i learn something new every day!
thanks for letting me know.
i will now go and try to find out which channel is his official one, and which ones are not official
although, i am sure that some channels that he is on, are not his official channel, but he is still a welcome guest on them.
apparently, i have a bunch more research to do.

I know u/ghee99 and "talked" to him, and in case you didn't hear, this is what happened...
as you know, u/ghee99 made it a point to NEVER break any of the rules of r/bitcoin,
but apparently there is at least on mod who doesnt think that any bearish opinions should be allowed at all, ever.
so without warming or reason given, u/ghee99 was permanently banned from r/bitcoin (at least thats what u/ghee99 says, but looking into his post history, it seems to be correct).
i mean, hey... if you want to start a movement to restore u/ghee's access, youre more than welcome to do so.  I personally like the guy, but i am not really active enough on this subreddit to even know where to start.
but according to u/ghee99, he is totally unable to comment on r/bitcoin anymore.  and when u/ghee99 wrote the mods to ask why, he found out that he was blocked from even being able to write the mods (so u/ghee99 cant even ask "why?")
i guess there is at least one mod who has it out for him, so it looks like he is gone for good.  Oh well.  I guess thats the way things are on here now.  its the NEW way.
and I guess only positive opinions on bitcoin are allowed anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:33:33
oh, i am sorry, didn't see it posted before
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:24:21
I don't know if he thought crypto was dead, but he certainly was bearish on bitcoin (i know we are talking about a few "missing" members, in this post I am talking about u/ghee99).  But he was always 100% polite, he never personally insulted any fellow user of r/bitcoin, ever, and he made a point to always say he lost money (which is why he was bearish), that he wasn't an expert in any sense, and that he HOPED it would go up - even if he was pessimistic about that happening and everything he said was not fact, but just his opinions.
and hey, he did warn people about the dangers of getting caught up in the hype, and buying a bunch of bitcoin in a time of high expectations.  thats what happened to thousands of people in dec 2017 and jan 2018, and those people lost unto 70% of their money.  So i was glad to see someone talking about such things, and not have it be all just "to the moon" and "lambo"
SO yeah.. it kinda sucks that someone who is super polite and followed all the rules just gets banned for having a bearish outlook on bitcoin.
Oh well, i guess the new way is that ONLY positive opinions on bitcoin are allowed (and otherwise, anyone who is consistently bearish will get permanently banned forever, no reason given, or appeal allowed)

You are making a post about economics and monetary policy, and you use a clip of Bernie fucking Sanders?
Do you want the US economy to become more govt-controlled?
I mean, i am with you 100% in regard to the FACT that banks NEED to be more accountable.
but if you want to be taken seriously when talking about anything to do with monetary policy, or finance, or economics, please don't use video clips from the worlds stupidest person (when it comes to economics).
Yes, the current US monetary policy is a mess, but Bernie's socialist, big govt "solutions" would make it even worse.
and yes, there is much work to be done in regard to banking and economics in the USA, but we are drifting ever so slowing in the right direction, and becoming ever so slightly more libertarian, with less govt intrusiveness.  Let continue to nudge our economy in those directions.
The solution will never be to spend more, take more from the people, and turn the control of the economy over to govt politicians and bureaucrats. Never.

yes, last winter i was here, and just about everyone was saying it would go to at least 40k
many were saying 100k, and some even said btc was going to 1 million.
but all in all, the general opinion as it went from 7-20k was that it was going to keep going until it hit at least 40k, perhaps higher
when you say things like "I was here last year and "almost everyone" did not call a 40k " you are 100% wrong.
You deny that most on here were saying it would go to 40k and higher?
thats simply not the case.  if you really believe that your memory is worse than christine blasey ford!!!
(by the way, i am not anti-bitcoin, and i accept responsibility for getting my advice from a subreddit.  i even will admit that bitcoin might come back to 20k again one day.

even now there is constant talk of how bitcoin is gonna go up (i've heard it every week of 2018)
in reality, all bitcoin has done is lose me a bunch of money.
"oh, but youre gonna make so much money if you hodl"
i hope so, but the people saying that are the same one who told me (when bitcoin was $18K) that bitcoin would keep on going up, up, up.

i get your point, but the messenger is also important
for example, in someone is in favor of vegetarianism, then it would be a bad idea to try to promote vegetariansim by using adolf hitler quotes (even though hitler was a vegetarian).
same with bernie, its good that he went against the corrupt banks, but if youre trying to make an economic point, then even if Bernie is correct on that one point, perhaps it would be better not to use bernie as part of your argument, as bernie is one of the all time stupidest people on the entire planet when it comes to understanding how economics works.

unless it comes back to $20k, i will have lost a bunch.
will i ever get it back? and when?  I know no one can say for sure, but does anyone have a good idea?  will it ever get back to $20k? and if so, when do you think that will be?
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:58:54
hey, everyone knows that bernie's plans are not only unworkable, but would be economically disastrous
even the non-partisan, site reason.com (which takes a logical approach to economics, and goes after both democrats AND republicans) points out how flawed bernie's plans are.
anyway, look into his actual economics, and you'll see how is is wrong on nearly every (economic) issue.
i mean... i get it, he's likable, and pretends to be a champion of the people, and he is funny/entertaining to watch, but it takes more than just those qualities for someone to be able to formulate great economic policy.
@_date: 2018-10-03 08:35:12
saying to buy when it was $18-20k was not wrong?
have you seen the price lately?
its in the $6k range
how was it a right to buy at a price thats $12-14 thousand dollars more than it is now?
what you say makes no sense.

i have been hearing all year about this new coming bull run
lots of talk about it coming, and yet it never seems to arrive
bitcoin just goes down all of 2018
but hey... i hope you are correct.
i'm tired of losing my money 
@_date: 2018-10-12 02:23:28
oh well...
here we go again.
down, down, down
and crashing down hard
when will this end?  does anyone know?
its like we just go down, and never come up
2018 is terrible
when will this be back to $20K?
...or is bitcoin over?
@_date: 2018-10-12 02:27:09
yeah, thats what i figured
i used to have hope, these days i just assume that i'll lose everything that i put into it
and hey, if i make money (which i doubt) i'll be happy
and if i lose everything i put into bitcoin I'll just be like "oh well, that what i figured would happen"
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:11:26
i'm still here and hodling.
stock market (for me) is up 7%
on the other hand, i'm minus 60% on bitcoin
so even a little stock dip with never be as bad as how my bitcoin is doing now
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:39:57
yes, i am in favor of buying assets at a lower price 
NOT buying assets at a price that is higher in the past, and just goes down
so yes, buying something high, and then having it go low is something i try my best to avoid

its now just getting boringAF
no one cares anymore, and why should they?
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:47:35
yes, thats true
every investment is a risk
i just made an investment in bitcoin that turned out to be a big money loser
oh well... thats life.
and who knows, maybe one day (even it if takes 10 years or more) if i hodl, maybe i'll even make money? i hope!
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:53:07
i didn't join reddit in march, i joined over 7 years ago
i was a lurker on r/bitcoin starting around april or may 2017
then i joined in october 2017, when i started thinking about actually buying bitcoin
i started buying in november 2017, and i continued to buy for november 2017, december 2017, january 2018, and even bought (what i thought was 'the dip' in february 2018.)
after that, i had lost so much money that i said fuck it, i'll never buy bitcoin again.  
i still am holding, and haven't sold any of my bitcoin.  but i'm down a lot, and am holding it all just hoping that in several yers or a decade or so it will go back to 20k again, and i can break even.
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:39:31

is it free?
and more importantly is it a chance for people who are involved with bitcoin to meet up and get to know each other?

is it one of those meetups where they try to turn it into a money making scheme to charge for tickets or sell you something while you're there?

@_date: 2018-11-30 17:57:01

its weird
its like bitcoin just loses value every single month for an entire year, and goes down -80% in that time
and then people lose hope.

@_date: 2018-12-11 02:07:33


yes, when it comes to bitcoin, that is correct
its only been ten months, so anything could change
but right now, when it comes to bitcoin price predictions, i am batting 1000
Not many know me, but i am definitely the king of bitcoin price predictors
and sure... bitcoin will be down to $1k by the end of the year
also, bitcoin will be stagnant and basically flat all of 2019 (priced between $400 and $1200)
in 2020, it will either *slowly* start to climb back up in price ever so slightly, or in 2020 it will die off.
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:22:33
well said
finally, some logic
its nice to hear a comment that's not "just HODL boys, its going to the moon any day now"
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:20:20
yeah, tell me about it
say anything other than "BTC is going to the moon! Lambo!" and you get attacked, insulted, and downvoted
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:56:02


but it won't (is my prediction)
and considering my predictions are 100% correct, i will stick with my predictions
i don't care about going with, or against, the crowd
i just wanna invest the right way, and the best way to invest (for me) is to NEVER buy any bitcoin again
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:36:57


its like a lottery ticket
odds of going out ahead are very low (at this point)
but IF you do win, it can be great
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:02:56
i hope you are right, but my guess is LESS optimistic
i am predicting that bitcoin will not do well in the future
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:00:16
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:55:17
yes, you holding onto your insults towards me, and conspiracy theories must be awkward for you
as for me, i'm staying on topic and talking about bitcoin, on here
so i'm good
i do hope you get help and feel better
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:16:31


wait, so i can get paid for just sharing my honest opinion on bitcoin (which is that is most likely will be bearish until 2020, and then after that, who knows?) 
cool, where do i go to get my check?
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:43:57
The brain is not the king
that's true (if its in the body of a leftist)
as leftists do not have brains
i was just referring to regular humans.
as for believing that others can make better decisions for me, nope
i believe in maximun freedom, which is why i oppose most govt regulations and why i support less intrusive govt
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:46:24
no idea who that is
but if he predicted that bitcoin will be down to $1-2 by the end of 2018, then he's clearly a smart predictor
everyone else said bitcoin wold never go below $7k
and yet, here is it, below $4K, and still crashing down hard
I am one of the few who guessed that (many months ago), i wonder if this ghee fellow you speak of also predicted correctly, like me?
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:10:08
oh wow!
its took a while, but you now stopped the personal insults, and are talking about bitcoin!!!
great job
see, thats sooo much better.
now, when you actually talk about bitcoin, i care about what you say, and actually enjoy your comments
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:00:57
hes not a troll
he's just pointing out that bitcoin, for ALL of 2018, is one of the worst investments ever
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:37:41
i hope youre correct
although, even a cat will eventually use up all of its 9 lives, sooner or later

@_date: 2018-12-13 20:37:59
its going down again
what a shocker!
but seriously, bitcoin is a fucking joke
biggest shitcoin of all time
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:37:33
that's what i thought, and its why i'll never buy bitcoin again
anyone who didn't buy before mid 2017 will never make a profit
for all the late adopters like me, bitcoin is, and will only be, a money loser
thank God i invested in stocks and real estate (cause those two are doing great)
and i'm also grateful i only invested a small amount in bitcoin (which has been a total money loser - 70% of what i invested in bitcoin is now all gone)
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:49:02
well, i am
and i've been right
but you do as you wish
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:52:53


i talk about bitcoin
i never post a comment that insults someone
if someone insults me FIRST, yes... i will reply
but saying that i come here and insult people on here is a lie
please don't lie about me
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:53:07
oh now you are claiming i use other accounts to upvote myself?
what happened to your other claim, about "linked accounts"
you know thats not even a real thing, right?
so you came up with a new conspiracy theory
thats hilarious!
besides, why do most of my comments have negative upvotes, if (according to you) i have hundreds of "linked accounts"
seriously, your delusion is crumbling, just take your meds, and get on topic
and the topic is NOT consiracy theories, its bitcoin
talk about bitcoin, not your crazy theories about secret spy identities or whatever other theories you imagine
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:35:21
i was clear
i was a total idiot, i bought bitcoin last winter because i listened to all the experts
after bitcoin began its crash, i said fuck the "experts" I'm going to follow my own intuition 
That was 10 months ago and since then i have been 100% correct
what does my intuition say will be next?
bitcoin to $1k by the end of the year (just wait, watch and see)  I bet i'm correct on this just as i have been on every other prediction i have made the last 10 months!
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:02:53
yes, after it hits $1-2, i think in 2019 it will slowly climb back up a bit
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:49:47
no, its never ok to message someone to personally insult them, as you do
if someone insults you first, then yes... its ok to reply to put them in their place, or get them on track
as for these "alts" you speak of, no idea what youre talking about.  is that like those "linked accounts" you used to talk about?

no, bitcoin is a shitcoin because (like most shitcoins) it lost OVER 75% of its value in less than one year
and its *STILL* crashing down hard.
I'm not saying don't buy it or hold (its a free country, do as you wish)
I am simply pointing out some actual facts (that bitcoin is down almost of its value, and still going lower)
Yes, at one time (before 2018) bitcoin was a good buy, but those days are over, and now its a money-losing shitcoin.
if you buy it now, my guess is that you'll lose even more money.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:14:52

i'm been doing that (about bitcoin) for 10 months now
welcome to the truth train, now that you've discovered me and my posts
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:42:00
i made the predictions originally in feb 2018
i wasn't totally sure then, but as each prediction i made came true, i was like
"wow, i am virtually the only one thats correct"
i am nailing it every time, and every time the "experts" are wrong
even now, i am not 100% sure
but i am 99% sure that i am right
and 99% sure that the "experts" on bitcoin are wrong
my current prediction is that bitcoin will be at $1K by the end of the year, lets just wait and see
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:10:32
thats actually a smart prediction by you.
that could actually happen
my guess, is $1k by the end of 2018
then i think for all of 2019 it will hover around $1k (but there could be dips as low as $400 throughout the year)
thats my opinion, anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:50:50
? You're still pretending not to be mentally ill? Ouch.
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:50:54
i'm allowed to have an opinion on bitcoin
and any crypto asset thats lost 80% of my money in the last year is going to be a crypto asset that i don't like
notice my posts are about bitcoin
your comments are insults directed at me
see the difference?
how about we use this  subreddit to talk about bitcoin, and NOT use it to personally insult fellow users?
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:08:53


but yes, in vegas... almost all of the people lose money
its the same with bitcoin (since late 2017-today) most people will lose money on bitcoin.   its just a money loser, with each month worse than the one before
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:29:28
i'm not, but if you want to think that i am a stick of butter, then you go right ahead, i am sure everything is just fine if your mind with the butterflies and unicorns all running around as you make up your conspiracy theories.
as for me, i will do what i can to keep you on topic (which is bitcoin, NOT your oddball theories about imaginary secret identities)
you are hilarious!
but please, talk about bitcoin, not the other things in your mind.  thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:54:07


yes, thats exactly what happened, I bought most of what i have in nov/december of 2017
i made my last purchases of bitcoin in january of 2018 
and by 2018 february, i realized it was gonna to go waaaaay down
so, i started my predictions (which turned out to be 100% correct) in feb 2018
wow, you cont understand that i used to think it was gonna be ok, but 10 months ago i realized the truth?
wow, youre not the sharpest tool in the shed, i see
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:33:20
just looked, today bitcoin is down ANOTHER 6%
its like EVERY.SINGLE.DAY lately is another huge loss
it never ends!
at this rate, we'll be down to $1K by new years
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:54:35

i've never been wrong before in my predictions about bitcoin, i don't think this time will be any different
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:01:35
so true
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:53:22
yes it is, holmes
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:30:50
not just raw dollars, but number of actual people negatively affected
AND also how much wealth was lost.
so sure.... if there is a crypto asset that goes down 90% but only has 1000 people that bought it, who cares
but when millions upon millions of people lose 80% of their value in an asset (as is the case with bitcoin) then yes... thats a much bigger deal to me.
and comparing gold to bitcoin?  LOL gold does change in price, but it is much more stable, and has never lost 90% of its value in one year, so its hardly the same thing (surely, you can see that?)
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:30:57


and its only getting worse
this is ultimately why bitcoin will die off
not totally die, just so little interest, and no profit to be made, it will wither on the vine
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:53:53
i'm shilling for another crypto asset?
wow, you conspiracy people are really going off the deep end today.
i am not some paid shill!
i'm just someone who is saying that bitcoin will go down to $1K by the end of the year
and I'm one of the very few that was correct to predict it would be down BELOW $4K by now (I predicted this in feb 2018).
In any event, you believe who you want, i never said you had to believe me, i just shared my opinion (not sure why me sharing an opinion you don't agree with bothers you so much???)
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:33:26
cool conspiracy theory, bro
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:18:39
and for those who bought anytime in the last year, its an even better 
Loser of value™️
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:50:28
1K by end of 2018
in 2019, could dip down to as low as $400
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:56:42


losing 80% of its value in less than a year is a sign of its excellent health
and the way it is still crashing down hard is a sign of life, too?
Love it!
thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:55:39
you are surprised?
i mean, have you ever read Mother Jones?
its 100% fake news
so, that their reporting on bitcoin would be false (like everything else they write) is hardly a shocker
if you want the truth, step one is to not support or read fake news sites like Mother Jones
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:45:54
but on occasion he points out how it will be worth more in the future
for an entire year, its been crashing, and crashing down hard
i think its time we admit bitcoin in in serious trouble
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:40:31


every time communism is tried, it fails

@_date: 2018-12-04 03:27:41
i can only speak for myself, 
but i have been bearish on bitcoin almost all year (since february 2017)
I've been saying it will go down all year, and its been crashing all year.
I predicted it would be down to $1-2K by the end of 2018
people laughed at me when bitcoin was $17k
but it doesn't seem too crazy now, does it?
anyway... i am just saying all this because i am happy to point out that bitcoin will do poorly, even on the days that it goes up a little.
basically, every single month of 2018 has been a bad month for bitcoin, and each one worse than the previous one.
after 2018 ends, it will stay bad for a while, then... by 2020 it might slowly start to recover (or might not)
but 2018 will end with bitcoin having lost 95% of its value, 2019 will be stagnant 
and 2020 will be the year that will make or break bitcoin.
and i will say that any day, good or bad, about bitcoin

yes, i see you started the research
good boy
i give you a star for that
but youre not done, get back to work
once you do MORE research, you'll see i was right.
once you find what i told you to find, come back here and apologize to me!
good boy! now run along and and do as i say!!!

Sean is opinionated, but at least hes honest that its opinion, and he tries to tell the truth
on the other most (not all, but most) left wing sites purposefully lie to try to bring down any republican, but especially Trump.
there are non partisan sites like drudge report, but when it comes to solid reporting without a left wing bias, I generally find myself going to rantingly.com these days for my news.
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:21:44

ok, whatever happened to your "linked accounts" theory?

and we don't mind losing our money, because we only invested what we could afford to lose, so we don't miss all that money, right? right?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:01:53
no need
i'll remember
besides, when it hits $1k then i am sure there will be bigger issues to focus on
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:15:53
yeah, that's really what i want to do, go around meeting strangers from online, and doing cash deals with them
what could go wrong?
no thanks, I am a successful person, I would rather use a trusted source, not shady deals with strangers or getting ripped off by bitcoin ATMs
but hey... if you want to do small times deals with randos, you go right ahead
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:35:40
as long as you got your wealth out of bitcoin, and into something stable like gold or us dollars, you'll be fine
it you keep your wealth in bitcoin, you'll be wiped out shortly
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:42:51
oh, regardless of what they do, coinbase is going to do the stuff whether or not i buy or sell with them or not.
so i might as well use them (besides **I will NEVER do business with any crypto company that doesn't have a phone number** to call if there if a problem)
and from what i can tell, coinbase is the only exchange that you can actually call if there if a need to call them).

hmmm... i wonder why?
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:39:17
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:49:41
you are 100% correct
its heading to $1K by end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:38:10
no i am not
you must have forgotten 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:24:39
no, bitcoin was a good buy up until the second part of 2017.
for early adopters it worked out well (especially if they were early adopters who sold in late 2017 or early 2018)
but now... its worse than that.  Bitcoin is already down -80% in less than a year.   Most likely, by the end of 2018, bitcoin will be down 95% in just one year.
That makes it one of the all time worst investments in the entire planet this year.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:05:57
i'm not your slave
do your own research
then, once you do, come back here and apologize to me!
...or accept that i'm correct, now!
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:23:53
and i'm not worried
i live in a great country, with a great leader, great friends and family, great job, and i enjoy each new day.
whatever bitcoin does, i'll be fine financially (and even if i wound up dead broke tomorrow, i'd *still* be fine, because my happiness is not tied to my bank balance, anyway)
so, whether or not bitcoin does ok, i'll be fine.  
and thanks for the kind words, and wishing you the best as well.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:43:05
right now, its down 7% again
more dead cat bouncing as it heads to the bottom
reminder of my prediction (from 2 months ago)
bitcoin will hit $1-2K by the end of 2018
unfortunately, it looks like I'm right on this prediction, and bitcoin will be down to 5% of what it was last year and the end of december
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:56:08
nice photoshop
thats some crazy conspiracy theory
now, moving along... this is a subreddit about bitcoin, pease limit your comments to the correct subject
i mean, i know youre obsessed with me, but in reality, lets just talk about bitcoin
you see, i can do it.  here goes.  I predict, that bitcoin will be down to $1-2K by the end of the year (2018)
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:31:55
seriously, "mom jokes" are what you have to contribute to this subreddit?
um, ok.
but i would suggest you stop with the rude insults, and stay on topic (the topic is bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:15:28
oh, thanks
i am looking as far forward as i can
thus far, i have been 100% correct, but i also can admit that its just my opinion, my best guess (not definitely facts)
i am looking as far as the end of 2019, but beyond that, i have no idea
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:01:12
hilarious conspiracy theories, ladies!
@_date: 2018-12-14 01:01:05
bitcoin has lost (at least) 6% of its value on 5 of the last 7 days
so the good news is, we won't have to HODL on much longer
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:43:33
yes, i am sooo upset that a crazy person has a conspiracy theory
thats why i keep making fun of you
�� �� ��
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:00:43
i posted an article that you didn't agree with
your reply was to engage in personal insults, and call me an "asshole".
seriously, i just don't get liberals.  why is it (with so many of you) if someone has a different opinion you become enraged and call them insulting names?
whatever happened to "oh, you have an opinion i disagree with, here is my opposing opinion in reply, expressed with politeness and respect?"
honestly, i just don't understand where the left's seemingly endless  anger comes from?  Its like other people aren't even supposed to be allowed to have a differing opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:52:34


Last year, I bought bitcoin, and my plan was to just to sit back and wait.
I did that
...and *sit back and wait* turned into *sit back and wait and watch 80% of my money go bye-bye.*
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:44:00


that makes sense.  most people don't know where its going to go.
on the other hand, i do.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:24:21
actually, it will be down to $1k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:59:52
no, i am going to hodl what i already have, but i will never buy bitcoin again
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:26:26
well... yes, i do think its gonna crash even harder, and deeper
but much like holding onto a lottery ticket that i already bought (as opposed to trying to sell it at a price much lower than i paid for it)
I'll just hold on to the bitcoin i already have.
it'll probably just go down, down, down, even more...
but its just money that i can afford to lose (although, i'd rather not lose it).
but nonetheless, i made my choice, i'll roll the dice and HODL onto the bitcoin i have purchased. I am not expectinganything from bitcoin, but if it somehow magically comes back up, i'll be happy to get my money back, or (who knows?) maybe even make money???
...and if it doesnt, then i'll just be like "oh well, at least i tried".
All of which is to say, yes... i still think bitcoin is a shitty investment that will keep on going down, but i'm gonna hold onto it, and see what happens ...just in case.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:00:46
there's no prize
when it comes to bitcoin (other than the early adopters) we're all losers
and whatever you're holding on to now? that'll be gone soon, too.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:25:10
yes, 100 percent correct
this is what i have been saying for 10 months
sad to see bitcoin dying, but at least others are finally waking up
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:37:52
look at all my original comments, i come on here to talk about bitcoin
look at your comments.
you don't talk about bitcoin and its price or anything like that.
you just insult others
yes, on occasion, i reply to one of your insults with an insult 
(either that, or you push conspiracy theories like that i am u/neveragain )
LOL - thats hilarious, and wrong, but also just a waste of time to post on a bitcoin subreddit!
on the other hand  99% of my comments on here are about bitcoin
to be blunt... you just are rude, insulting, and MOST OF THE TIME you are off topic
seriously why do you even come here if its not to talk ab0ut BITCOIN???
i mean, if you like to insult so much, then just go to some subreddit like r/LetsAllInsultEachOtherAllDayLong or something like that.
As for me, i come her to talk about, and read about bitcoin
and on that subject, bitcoin was up about 7% the other day, and now its down 6% today
looks like more dead cat bouncing for bitcoin
my thoughts ON BITCOIN are that it will just keep on going down in the rest of 2018
by the end of 2018, i think bitcoin price will be $1-2K
and then, in 2019, it will stay the same, or go up (very slightly)
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:16:04


because anytime someone is critical of bitcoin, they get downvoted into oblivion,
it appears only positive comments about bitcoin, and only saying that the price will go up, is allowed
say that you think the price will continue to drop, and say that you think bitcoin might be a dying technology and you will be insulted and called a troll.
oh well... I have long since given up, but if anyone want to try to be critical of bitcoin on this sub, go for it (although, prepare to be attacked and downvoted)
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:09:03
sure, 
sadly, it will most certainly go to $1K by the end of the year
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:15:31
wow, i shared an opinion on bitcoin, and your reply?
to personally insult me.
seriously, how can you possibly think that comments like yours make r/bitcoin a better place?
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:50:59
nice conspiracy theory
paranoid much?
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:42:42
we've had 5 (out of the last 7) days this week when bitcoin has gone down 6% or more (each day)
at this rate, we'll be at $1000 even faster than I predicted (I predicted it would be down to $1K by the end of 2018)
I mean... i do WANT bitcoin to recover, but this is NOT looking good.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:56:29
no one knows for sure
but its possible
i mean... even fidel castro's own son said that Justin Trudeau was the son of Fidel
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:44:56
enough with the blind defending of bitcoin no matter how it does
its not "trolling" to point out that for an entire years its been crashing, crashing hard, and still crashing with no end in site
its doing VERY poorly
i just choose to live with eyes open and admit the truth
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:23:35
agreed, it is the end
well, not yet, it will drag on and *slowly* die over the course of the next year
but yes, from here on out, its ONLY down
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:36:38


nope, it can just cease to exist, like napster or wang computer, or any number of past technology leaders that now are no longer around.
and yes... early adopters did well...  but thats over, and all of 2018 has been a total disaster, and its still crashing down hard with no end in sight

all i did was express an opinion on bitcoin
i have never insulted you, by the way
i just shared an opinion
you personally insulted me, and called me names
that sort of thing is troll behavior, please stop
focus on the subject of bitcoin, and less insults of your fellow users
got it?
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:21:08
yes, i have been saying for 10 months now that bitcoin was going to go down to 1-2K by the end of 2018
I was attacked and told that i was just spreading FUD
but like you, I also have the ability to see problems that almost no one else does. 
I knew it was going to crash this hard, and i STILL say its going to crash down to $1k (or less) before 2018 is over
Sadly, most people could not see what people like me and you knew for some time
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:57:45
talk about bitcoin
don't come on here to insult me or order me around
seriously, stop with the focusing and insulting of fellow users
and just talk about bitcoin (as i try to do)
but guys like you who just insult fellow users are tiresome
talk.about.bitcoin ...on here!
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:34:34


thats true
the big boys make predictions like etc will hit 1 million
in other words, the big boys are wrong
on the other hand, i might be a small time invested, no one cares, because i am correct
so, sure... people don't care about wrong predictors
but correct predictors like me?  many people love that.
my next prediction, bitcoin just went down 6% 
but will go down another 6-7% in the next 24-48 hours
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:42:45
right now everyone (even the negative nellies) think that bitcoin won't be dead by 2020
(just sayin')
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:55:09
i never said it was advice that anyone else should follow
i simply said what it was, and pointed out that its been 100% correct for 10 months straight
i even said "or just follow your own intuition."
you do what you want, i'm gonna follow my own correct intuition.

now THAT'S funny!!!
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:09:19
yup, i am bearishAF on bitcoin
it has lost more value (in actual monetary value) than any other crypto asset, ever.
and yes, i am bearish.  bitcoin has been dropping ALL year, is still dropping, and in will have another bad year in 2019 (is my opinion)
in 2020?  i am not sure.  it might come back, slowly, or it might begin its death throes (2020 is too far away for me to predict right now)
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:38:18
bottom soon?
nope, its gonna keep crashing down
will be down to $1k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:29:26
hilarious conspiracy theory
youre nearly as bad as the guy who said i had 10,000 accounts
hilarious, and yes.. cuckoo theory!
wow, you need to stay on topic instead of making up crazy theories about "linked accounts"
whats next? do you think alien lizard people are ruling the planet, too?
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:39:53
why, whats the problem with KYC?
it seems like i have to give my ID to all the exchanges (same as I already did to coinbase when i signed up)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:04:01
yes, for early adopters it was a great investment
but for anyone who has bought since late 2017 onward, its been an absolute disaster
and... in my opinion, it will only get worse (for at least the next year or so, after that, who knows?)
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:07:33
you turned my discussion about the price of bitcoin into an opportunity to personally insult me?
that was some serious trolling jujitsu 
next time though, stay on topic and enough with the insults, 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:02:06
its a joke user name (combination of the awesome Jesse Watters with nutty Maxine Watters)
as for the rest of your comments,t enough with the personal insults
please, keep it polite on here, i am so sick of people just attacking and insulting, its lameAF to do that, please stop!
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:52:55

Better analogies would be Vonage, enron, AOL, napster, friendster, blackberry, netscape, or tivo
They all either died, or became little more than shadows of their former selves.  Each was a leaders in their field (for a time) but then that time moved on, they failed to adapt, and these companies (once thought to be invincible) had their market share taken over by newer, leaner, more advanced successors.
This is what we are seeing right now with bitcoin, its in a transitional phase of lessening influence/importance (best analogy would be AOL, it still exists, but its went from the king, to merely a sideline player).
You can make your jokes, but that won't slow down bitcoins demise one bit.

yes, in the past, it grew alot
that ended in the end of 2017
since then, its been nothing but downhill
each month worse than the previous one
just keeps going down, and its *still* crashing down hard.
yes, for the early adopters it was a great run, but those days are over
anyone who bought in 2018 wasted their money.  down 80% in the last year.  no signs of an uptick in sight, and (my personal opinion) bitcoin will go down to $1-2k by the end of 2018
bitcoin, used to be a good investment, but now has become the biggest money-losing shitcoin of all time.
but as far as making money, that ONLY applies to the early adopters, no ones made a profit on bitcoin in quite some time (over a year)
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:43:59

how come you come on here to talk about me?  i'm not the topic of this subreddit
why don't you talk about bitcoin like i do? (and like the rest of us)
here, i'll start:
i think that bitcoin is dead cat bouncing, and my prediction is that bitcoin will be down to $1-2 k by the end of 2018

the real estate market will have a slight price dip (nationwide) although certain areas (such as austin, los angeles, and yes... even tulsa, and a few others) will stay flat.  
then, after 2019, the real estate prices (that had dipped slightly nationwide ...about 5-10% on average) will start to climb back up.
in other words, if you want to buy real estate, in most places the prices will be down, and its a great time to start looking now, and then buy anytime in 2019 will most certainly be a winning proposition 
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:17:02

@_date: 2018-12-10 05:17:50
yes, its a case of one really shitty asset (bitcoin) being used to replace an even shittier asset (the Bolívar fuerte).
using bitcoin is better than using the local cash in many 3rd world countries.  But if you want the most stable form of money, then you're probably best off with most of your assets in $US or Euros

and i do get a wide range of sources, 
and at least he is not a total liar like the dishonest rachel maddow, or the nutty lawrence o'donnell
On TV, probably the most intelligent, thought provoking commentator is Tucker Carlson.
and the best  analyst is definitely historian [Victor Davis Hanson](
but thats just who i like, i get my news from all sources, and even a few totally fake sources like CNN, just to know whats out there from all angles
having said all that, i do respect your willingness to re-evaluate your beliefs, and adjust your thoughts as you gain new information.  that is both rare and admirable.  Good luck in your journey.

but that was early, low value blips
now, its over, bitcoin will be $1k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:58:33


no it won't
basically, it will go to $1K by the end of the year
it will go below that a little, but basically stay between $400-1000 for all of 2019
in 2020 it will most likely die, although it might slowly come back up.  slowly, very slowly (if its not dead, that is)

and there you go again
using a bitcoin subreddit to insult people (as opposed to talk about bitcoin)
i mean, i get it... youre obsessed with me.  i live rent free in your brain.
you constantly seek out my posts, and reply to me
on the other hand i never seek you out, never comment first, and all my posts always start off with me talking about bitcoin (not you)
but you mostly don't talk about bitcoin, you just insult me.
here, let me help you, let me get you back on track.  i'm gonna post about bitcoin.
bitcoin is down 6% today, i think it will go down another 6-7 percent in the next 24-48 hours
thats how you do it
so, i would suggest to you, lay off the personal insults, and only reply to me if your on topic (i.e. about bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:28:09
yes i am against personal insults
i never went to one of your comments and started saying negative things about you
on the other hand, you did start commenting and being rude towards me (i just replied, and also tried, time and again, to get the discussion back to bitcoin)
i am not sure why you felt you had to start with personal comments towards me (after all, even you have to be honest to admit you started it)
but you did that, i just responded.  I NEVER START NEGATIVE PERSONAL COMMENTS TOWARDS ANYONE, EVER.
but now that I have corrected the record, here's to hoping you can get back on track and talk about bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:08:06
oh, so now i'm u/2handleSoon , too?
oh boy!  your conspiracy theories have really gone off the rails this time
I don't mean this as an insult, but please be more polite, and on topic?  if not, you might want to look in it
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:52:23
it will be down 95% by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:48:49
yes, other cryptos have lost more in percent
but in actual VOLUME of losses, bitcoin is the number in losses
no crypto asset has lost anything close to what bitcoin lost
Bitcoin is # 1
number one loser, that is.
and yes, in earlier times, bitcoin did well, and it was good to early adopters.
I am simply saying, for anyone who bought in the last year, bitcoin is the biggest loser of value (in both volume and in number of people who lost) and its gone from a good investment to a total money-losing shitcoin

@_date: 2018-12-10 23:38:32
because, i decided to stick to investing in things I know well (such as real estate and investing in Vanguard funds)
and I didn't know (at first) how 100% correct my predictions would be.  its only now, as they all become correct that I am learning how perfect they were.
but buy more bitcoin, or short bitcoin, or be involved in any way with further bitcoin investing?  
nope, i am done with investing or dealing with bitcoin,  i will never buy bitcoin again.
Yes, i will hold on to what i *already* previously bought in late 2017, and early 2018... but do anything else, or buy new bitcoin, or have any transactions on bitcoin exchanges again?
LOL.  hell no.
nope, bitcoin is garbage i'm done with it, and I don't want to be involved with investing with bitcoin again.
I'll just watch and see where it goes (because i am curious to see myself be correct once again, when it goes to $1k by the end of the year) ...and because i am curious about it.
but invest in a shitcoin like bitcoin again? nope, never.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:51:20
cause you went out of your way to write me, to insult me
I guess youre letting me live in your brain, rent free
or your obsessed with me
oh well...
time for you to move on, i'm just not into you!
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:05:26
because its gone down 80% of what it was worth only a year ago
and its still crashing downward hard
almost no one wants it, other that a few hodlers (and the whales getting rich off of use hodlers as they manipulate the market each new day)
my guess, by the end of december, bitcoin will be down to 5% of what it was last year
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:22:33
personally, i think now is a bad time, as i think that bitcoin will lose up to 75% of its current value in the next 30 days
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:05:46
just shutting down intolerance 
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:51:48
well, "true communism" doesnt take human nature into account, so it will never exist
capitalism on the other hand takes human nature into account
and although, it might not be perfect, its the best system we have
it works better than any other
i am not against trying new systems, but to keep trying one with a 100% failure rate (i.e. communism) is foolish.
generally speaking, left wing systems don't work,
ones that are more free market based do.
and the less power we give to those that rule us, the better and socialism is designed around giving most power to the govt, whereas  systems that give less power to the govt are the ones opposed by the left and the globalists
Lastly, in the USA most people are on some kind of govt. hand-out.  We need to stop giving away taxpayer's money to people and companies.  Good news is, under Trump, less people need govt help, so things like food stamp usage are going down.
but no able bodied person should ever be given anything from the govt without having to work for it.   And the less taxes we have (personal and business) the better.  Money is always better in the hands of a person or a company than it is in the hands of a govt that did nothing to earn it
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:18:11
Warren is such an idiot!
Yes, its technically true that he mades billions this year off of his investments.
And sure, i bought bitcoin and I'm down -80% of my investment.
But warren is against bitcoin, and I love bitcoin, so obviously... Warren is dumb, and I'm smarter than him because I bought bitcoin.
Hey, even if i lose money, i don't care, I'm in it for the technology.
And screw banks! i might lose 80% of my money by buying bitcoin, but i'm really sticking it to "the man" 
Not to mention, once "chinese new year" is over, i'm gonna be so rich! 
To the moon! Lambo! Buy the dip! HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:46:50
that's a hilarious conspiracy theory!
what else do yo believe, that the moon landing was fake?
but seriously... you should talk about conspiracy theories on one of those UFO subreddits
here on the bitcoin subreddit, we talk about bitcoin.  Please stay on topic, and don't distract with side subjects like your crazy conspiracy theories about secret identities and other users with names like "ghee"
you do know that "ghee" is butter?  You think that i am secretly a stick of butter?  
you've really gone off the deep end there, buddy!
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:15:40
oh, i figured out out its not easy
at this point, i just assume that i will lose it all (I've already lost 70% of what i put into bitcoin)
i just assume that i'll lose the remaining 30%.
i predict that bitcoin will be down to near nothing in a couple of years.
I'll just HODL on to what i bought, just in case.  and then...IF somehow bitcoin goes back up, i'll be pleasantly surprised
and if bitcoin keeps on crashing, i'll just be like "oh well, thats what i've been thinking all along, just what i expected"
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:06:53
call it what you want
i'm simply telling you that, in my 100% correct opinion, that bitcoin will be down to $1k by the end of the year
you can believe me or not, that s YOUR choice to make
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:11:47


please do not lie about me
you are not a bitcoin
as such, when i am bearish on bitcoin thats not an insult of you or any person
seriously, please think these things through
thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:39:08


i'm guessing you'll get your wish soon
my prediction?
bitcoin will likely be down to $1k by the end of december
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:36:28
sorry, the tyranny of the majority does not make them right.
i mean... seriously, you think that because more than one person disagrees with my opinions on bitcoin, that makes me wrong?
�� �� ��
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:28:10
ho lee fuk!
it doesnt even "dead cat bounce" anymore
every single day i look now, it just goes down.  thats it.
some days 6 or 7% 
other days "just" down 1 or 2%
thats all it is anymore...
just goes down.
doesn't even try to go up.
its like not even the whales care enough to try to pump and dump it anymore
it just swirls ever downward
this is the worst!
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:01:10
yes, i listened to all the people on here who were saying bitcoin would go to $40k or more in 2018
obviously, they were all wrong.
Since, then I have studied bitcoin, and I now know its slowly dying, and that its used to be a good buy, but now has become a total money-losing shitcoin
its cool, i only invested what i could afford to lose.  and i know better, and will NEVER buy bitcoin again.
I learned my lesson, and hopefully others have also learned, too
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:45:35


i hope it does come
and IF it does i will be happy
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:29:47
slow clap?
is that what you caught from the retarded girl?
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:58:17
you want to share pics?
no thanks, probably just you wanting to send me photos of your junk
either way, i am not interested
i mean hey.. i'm flattered that youre into me, but as i mentioned i am NOT into guys
stop harassing and stalking me
and don't feel bad, just because i'm not into you, no worries, you'll find a guy one day (just will never be me, cause i am NOT into guys!)
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:53:39


who said i have no support for the community?
i never said that
i simply said that i think bitcoin is doing poorly at the moment
i think it will be an even MORE bearish market for the rest of the year
i also think that ALL of 2019 will be a bad year for bitcoin
i admit that I don't know how it will do in 2020, although... i do think it could go either way (either die off, or start to recover in 2020 - its simply too far away to know right now)
but, you think that me expressing my bearish outlook on bitcoin for the next couple of years means i don't support the community?
nope, i am here sharing my honest opinion, and warning others to what i think are potential dangers
you disagree, and hey... thats your right.
but if you notice, i don't look for your comments, and then comment negative insults about you as a reply to your comments
what i do is come on here and share my opinion on bitcoin.
what you do is personally insult me (time and time again)
I am now choosing to get back to talking about bitcoin.
I hope you can do the same (and whatever you do, I will ask you, once again, to please cease and desist with the personal insults and name calling)
this is a subreddit about bitcoin, not a subreddit about insulting or roasting each other.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:27:46


i never said that
but just as i would never take advice on diet from michael moore
i would not take advice on how to manage my investments from someone who was poor.
in other words, when i need advice on something, i seek out those who have proven records of success in those areas.
as for you, if you want to be successful like me, you'd be better off to follow my advice, and not to constantly contradict me.
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:28:28
ok, like i must do to all who stalk me, and who won't stop bugging me
i have no choice... but i must block you
don't cry
youre blocked, but i wish you the best (even though i'll never know either way, as your comments will be blocked)
@_date: 2018-12-14 01:42:19
time and time again, you critique the quality of my posts?
what are you, a critic?
a critic who reviews posts on reddit?
dear god, thats the worst job ever!
i mean... seriously, why do you care so much about my random comments, so much so that you take time to critique each thing i say?
here's a suggestion, don't spend so much time critiquing what i say, and instead.... how about you talk about bitcoin?
it is r/bitcoin after all.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:51:09
if thats how you feel now, you're gonna be *really* upset when bitcoin goes below $1K (which will happen within the next 3 weeks)
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:18:17
no point in holding
it gonna crash down to $1K (perhaps lower)
might as well sell now, and buy back when its under $1k
but whatever you do, you can be almost 100% positive that it will keep on crashing hard for the rest of the month 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:58:56
bitcoin is going down in value because of something I am doing?
it appears that you don't know much about investing in bitcoin
but i can assure you, that one person (me) posting a few comments on reddit is not something that's causing bitcoin to lose 80% of its value in less than a year.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:45:50
hilarious theory
who told you that?  the little green men that live in your head?
but seriously, enough with your crazy insults and rude accusations
this is r/bitcoin
please talk about the correct topic (which is bitcoin)
and please learn to be more polite!
if you want to talk about your conspiracy theories about my "secret identities" LOL
i am sure there is another subreddit you can do that on, just don't do it here!
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:19:05
yes, us dollar is one of the most stable and safe stores of value.
on the other hand, let me see how my bitcoin value is doing?
oh will you look at that, i lost 75% of the wealth that i put into bitcoin, just gone... poof!
thats right, lost 75% of bitcoin's value in less than one year.
on the other hand...
when i want a stable, fluid store of value, i store wealth in US dollar
when i want to diversify a stable store of value, i will buy limited qualities of gold or silver.
when i want a safe investment option, i invest in real estate and in my vanguard investment portfolio (mixture of stocks and bonds).
but bitcoin?  I will NEVER buy that garbage investment again
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:04:02
first of all, what's up with your message, are you on coke?
and as for you saying:


nope, bitcoin will not go up to $20K again
its gonna go down to $1k in the next few weeks, and then stay at $1K or less for all of 2019
after that who knows ?  it might come back a little bit, or it might die off (sometime in 2020)
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:40:11
 
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:06:38
i'm the most tolerant person that ever was
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:37:34
nope, 
went right over your head
it was hyperbole
the whole point is that a home person's "waste" is a BAD investment, the worst you could ever make
in other words, no one wants it, to invest in it would be foolish
bitcoin isn't that bad, but its still a terrible investment
(seriously, its hilarious that you didn't get it, and i had to explain it to you)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:16:04
no idea what this means?
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:16:22
merci beaucoup!
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:11:06


yes, bitcoin will bottom out soon.  it will hit $1k by the end of 2018
ALL of 2019 will just be (mostly) flat, ranging from $400-$1200
in 2020, I don't know.  it will either slowly start to climb back up, or just slowly start to die off.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:16:34
wow, those chinese have been celebrating new year for over 11 months 
but as soon as they are done, then watch out, bitcoin will go to the moon
�� �� ��
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:50:37
yes, i don't know how to do it
i bought bitcoin at about $18K
and since then, bitcoin has been nothing but a money loser for me
if there is a way to make money on bitcoin anymore, i certainly haven't figured out out
from what i can see, for the last year, bitcoin is nothing but a money loser
i do hope that changes (obviously) because i do hate how bitcoin does nothing but go down, down, down, in value
worst investment i ever made, i wish i had never bought it.
but hey...maybe, one day, bitcoin will go up again...
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:24:33

@_date: 2018-12-10 21:57:17
bitcoin will be down to $1k but the end of 2018
ALL of 2019 will be mostly flat (with price ranging from $400-$1200)
in 2020 it will either *slowly* start to climb in value, 
either that, or in 2020 it will die off like napster or friendster or netscape navigator or some other outdated technology
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:58:28
Many times I have written a comment about bitcoin, and you have responded to what I wrote by personally insulting me.
I have never sought you out, and I have never replied to one of your comments by personally insulting you.
I come on here and I post about bitcoin.  You come on here, find my comments, and then personally insult me (and make ridiculous claims against me, such as that i am a paid troll)
Do you see that difference?
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:46:31
wow, more personal insults?
how about we talk about bitcoin, as opposed to insulting fellow users?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:06:34
serious question
i see many people on here hate banks
but i also see MANY people on here saying that when the banks and institutional investors get involved in bitcoin, thats when bitcoin will go to the moon
so which is it? are banks bad? or will banks make bitcoin go to the moon?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:02:44
no, Jesse is on foxnews on "the five' every day now, and he also has his OWN show on saturdays, too

how'd that turn out?
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:28:16
oh, ok, you have "proof"

@_date: 2018-12-03 23:13:03
you are obsessed with me
but your posted link is silly, just proves that i don't know this person you speak of, ghee is it?
whatever the case, please just lets talk about bitcoin (and not your conspiracy theories)
now, on topic, i will start: bitcoin is going down the rest of 2018 is my analysis
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:37:03
i did my research
and no matter how you look at it, bitcoin is a terrible investment
(for anyone who bought in the last year)
i've already lost most of what i put in, so i might as well hold and see what happens
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:03:02
when it comes to losing value, no other crypto has lost as much in actual value as bitcoin
early adopters did fine, but anyone who bought in the last year has lost money,  in all of 2018, bitcoin has been a total shitcoin
it is actually the biggest, most money-losing shitcoin of all time
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:21:40
yes, but when it comes to being successful, MacAfee does that well
pure intelligence (to me) without success is not that appealing
i mean, being a genius that lives alone and works as a janitor is nothing i would aspire to.
but having an ability to be successful, and enough drive to achieve your goals, even with an average intelligence is much better to me.
I'd rather focus on a successful happy life, as opposed to just focusing on raw intelligence alone.
so, in the qualities that are more important than JUST intelligence (such as being successful and going after goals, and having fun in your life) John MacAfee is doing great.
I will admit, when it comes to predicting bitcoin prices, he is not so great at that
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:27:39


i never heard of it before, but always glad to have access to something new.  when i get a chance, I'll look into it.
(although, with the way bitcoin is doing... yes i will HODL the bitcoin i already have, but i will NEVER buy bitcoin again.  Its the worst investment I ever purchased.)
nonetheless, thanks for the info on bisq, might come in handy one day (if bitcoin is even still around in a few years, that is?)
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:25:13

i'm just going off my intutition
and my intuition has been totally correct every step of the way (for the last 10 months)
while the so-called experts missed all the signs and were wrong
but the choice is yours, you can continue to listen to the experts, or follow my 100% correct intuition
or just follow your own intuition.
whatever the case, my advice is to avoid listening to the so called experts, and make your own choices
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:21:47
oh no
you were doing so well... you even started off talking about bitcoin
but alas...
one step forward and two steps back 
you wound up spending the second part of your post NOT talking about bitcoin, and instead insulting me
I'm VERY disappointed in you.
oh well... i suggest you pick yourself up, dustt yourself off, and try to not insult others on here, and do (as i suggest to you) talk about bitcoin (after all, it is the BITCOIN subreddit)
you were doing well a few moments ago, try to remember that, and stick to bitcoin talk on here (not insults)
here, let me try to help you.
Topic:  some people say the banks are the enemy, others say bank investment will save bitcoin.  discuss!

yes, thats what the globalists want you to think
but seriously, if hes the same, why are the globalists fighting against him soooo hard?
anyway, i won't tell you how to think, I will just respectfully suggest to you that you do some digging around on your own (avoid the corrupt main stream media liars, of course), and see for yourself.

@_date: 2018-12-10 21:09:10
if bitcoin gets any cheaper, they'll be paying people to take it.
seriously, what the fuck?
at this rate, bitcoin has now become the biggest money-losing shitcoin of all time!
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:12:58


i only invested what i could afford to lose
but that doesn't mean i have to like losing 80% of the money i put into bitcoin.
seriously, WTF?
People like me lose 80% of their money invested in bitcoin, and then we are not allowed to express displeasure with how poorly bitcoin has been doing?
sorry bro, but bitcoin (for anyone who bought any bitcoin this last year) has been a total shit investment.
Yes, i will HODL what i have, but i still think (if i am sharing my honest opinion) that bitcoin will go down to $1-2K within the next 25 days, and that in 2019 bitcoin will stay down that low, or go even lower (after 2019, i have no idea)
but hey... just because people like you only want positive happy talk, who cares?  I will share my honest opinions and thoughts, good or bad, no matter what they bitcoin thought police tries to tell me
p.s. i didn't say it was heading toward total zero (i have no idea) i did say that it was a heading down to $1-2K within the next 25 days
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:07:19


just because something can be bought cheaply, doesn't mean i want it
i am sure a homeless guy will sell me his "waste" very cheaply, 
yes, i will HODL what i already purchased, but no... i still wouldn't buy more of it, no matter the price.
same with bitcoin, i'll never buy it again, its the worst mistake i ever made, i won't make that mistake ever again.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:09:07

oh man!
you lucky duck!
i wish i had done that!!!
you're a genius, you saw it all before me.
as it is, i bought in late 2017, and now 80% of the money i put into bitcoin is gone, and its getting to be less with each passing month
i live in denial, thinking that it will come back, but alas... i am not as smart as you, and i decided to HODL
God i wish i had sold last december, right after i bought, i would be so much happier right about now.

well, i haven't sold ANY that i purchased
i am not optimistic, 
but, kinda like buying a lottery ticket, i'll just hold onto what i have, and see what happens
I believe the odds to be VERY low that I'll ever even break even on bitcoin...
but hey, i've chosen to roll the dice, and see what happens.
and even if i lose it all (which i think is the most likely possibility) I don't care that much (its just a very small part of my overall investments) and when its all done, i can at least say that I tried
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:09:28
thats one hilarious conspiracy theory!
i love it, hilarious
you need to focus on bitcoin more, and conspiracy theories less, no offense, but you seem to be losing your mind
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:57:41
actually, there will not be much of a bounce
there might be a minor dead cat bounce, but basically...
bitcoin will get down to $1-2K by the end of 2018
after that, it will stay there or just very slightly rise in 2019
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:46:36
yes, the whales got rich, anyone who bought after summer of 2017 lost big time
and its still going down, 
low, low, low
how low can it go?

i am sure, if you look hard enough, there are occasional grains of truth 
but all in all, big picture sense, MJ just exists to push a dishonest leftist narrative
its basically just propaganda for the democrat party and other left wing groups that want to bring the USA down and turn us into a socialist hellhole
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:13:54
excellent point
sure, some early adopters made bank
but most people (and ALL who invested in the last year) have lost money on bitcoin
for most, its just a sucker's bet, and a real money loser.
Basically, just new version of buying a lottery ticket.
And hey... I'm not putting anyone else down, I fell for it, too.
Buying bitcoin was the WORST investment of my life (Thank God I only invested what i could afford to lose).
Still, I learned my lesson, I'll never buy bitcoin again.
and yes... i am going to HODL what I did buy (you know, the same way you hold onto a lottery ticket, hoping it will win, even though logic tells you its foolish to have even bought it in the first place).
but you are correct, when you say "none of you" made actual profits, count me in amongst the ones who got caught up in the hype and all the talk about how it would go up in value (but in reality, I LOST over 75% of the money that i put into bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:43:31

thanks, i am one of the few that predicted (in february 2018) that bitcoin would be down to $1-2K b the end of the year).
I was ridiculed then, but i looks like i am right on track to be 100% correct.
oh well... I tried to warn others, no one wanted to listen.  I was just yelled at, temporarily banned, and told i was just spreading FUD and that i was a "troll"
I'm no troll, I'm just sharing my opinion, and my opinion is still the same.
My best guess? bitcoin will be down to $1K by the end of the year (in a few weeks)
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:57:09
nothing in life is guaranteed
but yes, i am 99.9999% precent sure of my predictions

IF ????
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:59:32


lots of people care about what a totally accurate predictor like me predicts
someone like you would never get that, since no one probably ever asks for your opinion.
on the other hand, a mostly correct predictor is great appreciated, and many inhere agree with and thank me for my predictions and warnings
if you learn to listen to me, you could save money or lessen your risks, as i have a near 100% correct track record (which is better than all those other so-called "experts")
besides this is a fun subreddit for those who own BTC to talk about it, so its not about whether others follow my advice or not.
its just me sharing my opinion, and others sharing their opinions, and us all talking
its just part of being a social subreddit, and people sharing opinions.
that you feel the need to personally insult someone like me, just because i have a different opinion in a discussion shows you to be improperly socialized, and shows you to be someone who doesnt even understand how to talk about ideas with others and be social
have you never hung out at a party or a bar?
thats what normal people do, we talk about ideas, and when we disagree with someone, we don't start personally insulting them
seriously, you need to get out more, the way you talk it seems like you might have aspergers? or some social limitation?
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:22:42
yes, that and chinese new year!
:) 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:29:59
yes, i bought too  late
i am totally patient (I haven't sold any that i bought, and i am HODLing on to it all)
its a long shot gamble at this point, and i think its most likely that bitcoin will just keep crashing and will be down to $2k (at least through 2019)
after that, who knows?  It will either slowly start to come back up, or just die off due to lack of interest or technological changes that make it irrelevant
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:05:40


yes, for early adopters bitcoin was great (especially if the did not HODL)
in my opinion, those days are over, and also in my opinion, bitcoin is just a money loser fro everyone else, from here on out
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:30:35


no, i am done investing in bitcoin in any way
its a shitty financial vehicle for wealth accumulation
i won't buy it, or short it, or have anything further to do with it as an investment
i already bought some (back in late 2017 and early 2018) so I'll hodl onto that.
but buy more? never.
and when it comes to investing and creating wealth for myself?  I will stick with solid money makers for me, like real estate and my various Vanguard investment funds.
as for the Super Bowl.  hahahaaa  football is boring as shit, why would i want to watch a bunch of crybaby spoiled millionaire kneelers play catch and grab.  gayest shit ever.  no thanks, not my jam.

@_date: 2018-12-07 05:52:57


i've been waiting to see how this plays out for the last 12 months
and i see how its going
each month is worse than the one before, and we've now hit a tipping point, and things are getting worse even *faster*
bitcoin is quickly becoming a shitcoin
will it come back?  who knows?
but my opinion is that *bitcoin goes down to $1k within the next few weeks*
and then stays at (or below) $1K for all of 2019
after that?  who knows, but bitcoin might be considered even more of a joke by 2020, or might even just die off by then
And i'd love to "look foolish" and have bitcoin go to the moon
but a year of hearing people on here say each new dip was only "temporary" and each new low was "a great time to buy"
yeah right.  
sorry, bitcoin is doing poorly and getting more unhealthy each passing day.   I waited a year listening to the optimistic ones, now its time for reality to set in, and for people to accept the truth that bitcoin was a valiant attempt, but ultimately a failure.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:09:45


not possible
for example, i use Apple (even though they give money to fund the global warming alarmism scheme)
and i use google, even though they use their company to try to falsely smear our President with fake news results being listed first
heck, i am wear shoes made by Tom's, even though they are giving money to groups trying to take away gun rights from law abiding Americans 
you see....
thats just the world today, you sometimes have to use companies that you disagree with


seriously?  having a person you can talk to, to fix things, is NOT a good thing in your mind?
being able to reach an actual human is always better than a company that just has an email, as they can take days to get back to you, and also will usually take several emails to fix anything (as opposed to talking to an actual human on the phone and who can take care of things on the spot.)
I mean, if thousands of dollars were all of a sudden gone from my bank account at a regular bank, I would call them, and take care of it right away.  I wouldn't just write them an email and wait a week and just see what happens.  I am not passive nor do i leave things like that up to others to decide.  its my money, and if its gone, you can be sure i will be on top of that shit, and demanding it be fixed ASAP.
but I guess youre much more passive than i am
that you do business with companies that want you to give them your money, but they won't even let you know what their phone number is!???
doing that is the stupidest thing i ever heard of.  I would never do that.  That you think thats OK tells me all I need to know
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:20:11
i don't even know what youre talking about
nice conspiracy theory though
but, you seem obsessed with me, you come onto a bitcoin subreddit and then talk about me the whole time.
how come you don't talk about bitcoin, like i do? (and like the rest of us do, too)
the rest of us talk about bitcoin and crypto, and you talk about conspiracy theories and secret identities you imagine
but seriously,,.... lets stay on topic, and talk about bitcoin
I'll start.
I think that bitcoin will lose 6% more in the next 48 hours
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:01:02
being poor? no idea.
i mean, at one point in my life i was, but that changed quite some time ago
most of my investment are in real estate, and secondarily in Vanguard investment funds
only a small amount of my total was put into bitcoin
bitcoin wound up being a total shit investment, and i lost 75% of that
but since my regular income, and my investment income is strong,
and since i only invested in bitcoin what i could afford to lose, I'm in good shape.
besides, i learned my lesson, bitcoin is shit, and i'll never buy it again, ever.
but... i'll survive just fine.   but hey... you tell me, how many houses do you own?  I'd be shocked if it was more than 2 (which is how many i own).  No one i know, my age, owns two homes.  Even the tenants that live in my other house that i rent are older than me, but they turn over their paycheck money in rent to pay MY mortgage. (you probably pay someone your landlord's mortgage, too)
but sure... go ahead mr moneybags, tell me how smart and rich you are.  and what model lambo matchbox car you have?
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:29:47
if want govt to be like th human body, you must be in favor of a monarchy, where the human brain is the king, and is in charge of everyone else?
as for me, i prefer freedom
maybe listen to some Victor davis hanson videos, that could clear up a lot for you?
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:06:01
yes, at least coinbase doesn't seem like a total disorganized mess
before i started using coinbase (and GDAX) i looked into kraken
they were totally disorganized and took a month just to verify me
same was true with other foreign exchanges that i looked into.
so, I'll stick with coinbase, as fees are low and they stable.
also, any company that doesn't have a phone number is a company i will never deal with, and coinbase has a phone number to call if there ever is a real problem (none of the other exchanges have phone numbers that I could find).
i mean, think about it... if you walked into a regular bank to deposit your money, and as you were depositing your money they told you "yes, we do have a phone number, but  if you need to call too bad, because we will never tell you what our phone number is"
what would you do?  would you trust them with your money?
of course not.
its the same with any exchange.  If they won't share with you their phone number, then thats a red flag, and serious indicator that you should NEVER do business with ANY crypto company that refuses to let you know what their number is.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:59:47
yes, early adopters did well
but as of 2018, it ended
bitcoin, for anyone who bought in the last year, it a money losing shitcoin
and its still crashing downward, with no end in sight!
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:48:13
sure, follow whomever you want.  i never told you to follow or obey me.
i just made a prediction, and i pointed out how my predictions have been 100% correct
whereas the so-called "experts" were almost entirely wrong this year
so sure... follow my advice, follow the 'experts" or just do your own thing, its a free country, do whatever you want
no need to be so impolite, just live and let be.  peace!
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:53:48


but they are both bad investments!
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:58:13
so true
i remember last year, when bitcoin went from 20k to 17K
and (nearly) every one was like HODL!!! its gonna go to the moon any day now
macafee says $1million!!!
its just chinese new year
don't sell!
(I Bet all those people who listened to that advice, and HODL when it was $17K are kicking themselves now)
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:34:28
good thing you bought now.
yes, bitcoin will keep on crashing, but at least now you'll only lose $3000, and not $20,000

you seem to only reply with insults,
you are seemingly unaware of how to engage in basic socialization, and cant seem to accept any opinions that differ from your own
you always default back to personal insults, no matter how many times i try (time and time again) to bring the discussion back to bitcoin
question for you, and no offense (I am being serious) have you considered looking into whether or not youre autistic or have aspergers?
you do seem to have some inability to relate to humans, and sociaize within normal parameters
you might want to check that out.
good luck with all that, and if you ever want to talk about bitcoin (without personal insults) then by all means... getting diagnosed and treated might help you!
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:55:28


no worries
i'll never buy bitcoin again (worst investment i ever purchased in my entire life)
as for 2022, bitcoin might do better then, or it might just be a bad memory, another failed shitcoin.
either way, thanks for your insight
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:32:15


if you buy now, it won't be cheap
buy in january and it will be $1k

more like an invention for *destroying wealth*.
people work hard to create wealth.
some of those people then take the wealth their earned through their own hard labor and buy crypto with
...and then, over the course of one year, "poof" their wealth is gone.  vanished.
its like they did all their labor to earn money for free, and got nothing in return, and their wealth is now gone.
this invention, bitcoin, has one primary purpose, take away the wealth of those who invested in it, and give that money/wealth to a bunch of whales, exchanges and manipulators.
but you are correct, the idiots who invested in bitcoin (and i was one) are a mostly arrogant bunch of "we know more than you regular investors" who ran around acting like they knew everything, as they proclaimed that they were going to get lambos when bitcoin went "to the moon".
haha, they are all back to eating ramen again.  As for me, I lost almost everything that i put into bitcoin (luckily, i only invested what i could afford to lose).
But i am at least smart enough to admit that bitcoin was a total waste.  I'll never buy it again.
Whats amazing, is that there are STILL some people on here saying that bitcoin will do great, and that you should buy more?  LOL  buy more bitcoin?  hahaha
no thank you!

hey you never know, but i don't believe most of the gossip that i read, and most media is all lies anyway
so, i don't believe it, unless there is actual proof
I am not sure where you live, but i am in the USA, and here almost every main stream media company is just left wing, pro-globalist lies (so naturally, they would want to attack a free thinker, non-informer like MacAfee)
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:04:28
could be worse
many investors lost 85%
basically EVERY single person who bought bitcoin in 2018 has lost
bitcoin is just a shit investment, no one (except early adopters) made money.
and anyone who stays in, in my opinion, will LOSE even more.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:39:39
more like $14

For me, I learned about investing too.
I never thought that investing in a supposedly strong investment would turn out so poorly
I put several thousand dollars into bitcoin.  Within one year 80% of that money is gone.
And its still going down, hard.
I'm HODLing,but it all seems like a big scam.
Some whales and early adopters got rich, and i got fucked.
Anyway... i don't blame anyone but myself, lesson learned (i.e, avoid bitcoin, stick with tried and true investments like real estate or Vanguard funds, etc).

But yes... to get on the bitcoin topic, 
sure, heres a non-price bitcoin comment.
Almost all companies dealing with crypto (with a few exceptions like bitcoin) do not have any way to easily or quickly get in touch with them.    If you lose your money on a ledger wallet, no live tech support.  Lose your assets on most exchanges through error, no one can help you (unless you count writing an email, and then not hearing back for weeks).  The stories of unresponsive crypto companies are endless.  I suggest that any company that you trust to deal with your crypto wealth on any level have a phone number.  If they don't, my advice... boycott them!
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:58:04
yes, it was a huge (one time) pump and dump

i mean... i am not positive, but my guess it that bitcoin will go to $1-2K by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:08:04
to politely answer your question, i would have to say that i bought bitcoin because i thought it would go up in value, or at least stay about the same
i thought interest and price would increase
but these days, bitcoin is considered a joke by any serious or intelligent investor, and its price *only* goes down.
yes, early adopters did well, but those days are gone.
bitcoin, once respected, has turned out (in all of 2018) to be the biggest money losing shitcoin of them all.
its down 80%, and STILL crashing hard.
my best guess is that it will be down to $1-2K by the end of 2018
and then, it will stay low, or go even lower in 2019.
Will it rebound and go to the moon?  sure, anything is possible, but i seriously doubt it.  i think it had its peak, and its just a money loser for people like me who bought in 2017 (and afterwords)
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:58:19
yes, for anyone who bought bitcoin before 2018, there was possibility of making money
for all those who bought any time in 2018, its been a real money loser
don't buy bitcoin any more is my advice, its only going to go down even more
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:06:17
and there you go, with personal name calling and insults
Thanks for making MY point!
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:43:15
ok, i hope youre right, because this entire year has been terrible, and no sign of it getting any better
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:59:36


but you sharing *your thoughts* is soooooo great?
youre the one who's been wrong so many times this year
and i'm the one who totally predicted this entire year
but MY opinion is the one thats "worthless"???
 
thanks for the laugh!!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:11:12
you can split hairs
but the reality, is people buy an investment thinking it will go up (or at the very least hoping it will)
bitcoin, on the other hand... only goes down.  this has been the case all of 2018, with each month worse than the one before.
and bitcoin is *still* crashing down hard, with no end in sight.
for me, its the worst investment i have ever made in my entire life.  I can admit it though, i was a fool to buy it.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:24:32
oh, i thought bitcoin was not anonymous after all?
also, i live in the usa, i've never found an exchange thats anonymous, is there one?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:54:16


thats true, although... thus far, i am one of the few that is nailing it with my totally correct predictions
and i agree, those who predict prices (that are not correct) are a dime a dozen
on the other hand, someone like me, who predicts correctly (even when no one else can see it) is a true diamond, that adds to the discussion
if you ever want to know what bitcoin will do, then i suggest you consider seeing what i have to say (based on my excellent track record)
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:47:45
personal insults?
so tiring
how about we talk about bitcoin, NOT just insult fellow users?
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:09:58
oh weird
i think part of mental illness is that the crazy person actually believes their delusions to be true
i guess that explains your conspiracy theory about everyone on here having multiple secret identities
i don't care really, although i do feel kinda sorry for your brain, on account of it not working properly 
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:26:59


no kidding
its now in a bear market that we will be in for years, and might never recover from
its a total shit investment, but hey... put ALL you money in it, its a free country!
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:04:11


a lot!!!
my intuition told me to start investing in Los Angeles real estate, and i made a killing these last few years
and my intuition told me to invest into Vanguard funds, and I've made 6-8% every year that i have had money in there.
i did NOT listen to my intuition in winter 2017 when i started to invest in bitcoin for a few months, and i lost 75% of that money.
but i did start listening to my intuition in early february 2018 when it comes to bitcoin, and my intuition said do NOT buy any more bitcoin, its gonna keep on crashing hard for the entire year.  Since then I have not bought any bitcoin (and thank God i did not, as bitcoin has done terribly)
Luckily, i only invested in bitcoin what i could afford to lose, and luckily i listen to my intuition most of the time when it comes to all investing, so all in all, I am going great.  i just need to remember to never buy bitcoin again, as it totally sucks as an investment
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:34:17


wow, more with the rude personal insults
do you honestly think that personally insulting those who have a different opine makes r/bitcoin a better place?
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:10:43


we are changing and waking up
we elected Trump, and will soon be great again
the losers, betas and cucks want to stay slaves to the globalists, but they will lose
french people are waking up too
brexit, MAGA, yellow vests!
world is waking up, one country at a time
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:45:51
in the past maybe, but these days you can lose either all, or some of the value you put into bitcoin
id have to say its the most unsafe, and worst store of value possible
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:39:03
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:36:48


nope, part of being a successful person (which i am) is to delegate.
Sure, i could learn everything about becoming a bitcoin self-banker, or i could just have coinbase do it for me.
and that way, i can focus on things that i am best at, like buying more real estate and building my company.
my goal is not to do everything myself, my goal is just to do one or two things really well, and then have others working for me, and making me wealthier and freer to do as i wish.
but hey... if you cant delegate, or don't know how to lead, then sure... your way of doing everything yourself sounds fine (for someone like you).
good luck with your plan to have to learn and do everything yourself, maybe if you learn enough about bitcoin banking, you might be able to work for me one day as one of my minions.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:43:20


nope, bitcoin is crashing hard, has been crashing hard for a year, and no end in sight
we'll be down to $1 by the end of the year
bitcoin is the worst investment in 2018
total waste of money
get out if you care about money, otherwise (my opinion) it will be down to pennies before too long
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:38:50
um, ok
cuckoo man, whatever you say
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:37:04
i own one of my houses out right (I paid cash)
the other is particlally financed, but thats cool, too.
you see, i am actually using the bank's money to earn money
i bought a house, and now my tenants pay me more than the house costs me, and at the end of the mortgage I will own that asset.
So, i am getting it at no cost to me, making a profit along the way, and will own it outright in a number of years
so, sure... the bank makes money, but what do i care?  thats how wealth is made.  I am gaining wealth.  this how you get rich bro (not buy buying a dying asset like shitcoin bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:59:30
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:27:55
yes, i do know that
it had some ups and downs in the past
but it hit its big ATH about a year ago
and, in my opinion, it will go down to $1-2K by the end of 2018
and then will stay around that level for all of 2019
after 2019?  i think it will either climb back up, or just die off
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:05:39


um, ok
so, if bitcoin is down to $400 by mid 2019 you think that will have no effect?
i am not saying i KNOW it will be that low, but it might
and yes...  thinks like that do matter, and affect bitcoin, a lot!
as for the personal insults, for God's sake, give it a rest, talk about bitcoin, but STFU with all the insults in every God damn post you write, its getting tiresome.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:42:41
a dead cat bounce here and there, but all in all, its still way down for the week/month/year
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:26:47
well, when bitcoin is down to $1k by the end of 2018, the biggest issue will be that bitcoin lost 95% of its value in one year
so, the very survival of bitcoin (as anything other than a dying shitcoin) will be a bigger issue
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:16:19
my "alts"
um, ok... you have a great imagination, thats for sure
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:55:39
yes, in the past, bitcoin was a good investment
those days are over
its only going to go down the next couple of years.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:15:45


its an investment.
i am an entrepreneur 
i invest and have others working for me to build wealth
i'm not some 15 year dreaming of taking town the banking system, lol
i don't care if others (such as bankers) do well.  If they're not directly bothering me, i say "live and let live".
if a bank can make me money, i'll do buisness with them (I do all the time when i take out a mortgage with a bank to buy real estate, for example)
same with bitcoin, i'm dealing with it because i bought it with the hopes of becoming wealthy off if it.
Sure, i do try to avoid unethical projects or doing anything that is supportive of evil people like George Soros or hillary clinton...
but other than that, i delegate and let others work for me to improve my bottom line.

[bernie just spent $300K last month in private jet costs](

fuck all these leftist hypocrites and their multiple mansions and private jets preaching to us that we need to use less energy (as they use more in one month than your average person uses in their lifetime)

no, i "get it"
youre just in denial because you don't like seeing bitcoin dying
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:51:49
no, its worst quality is an evil tyrannical govt, and lack of freedom and rights for its citizens
like most socialist nations, the leaders live like kings, and the people are essentially slaves with no rights
but, since you seem to have never been there, how could you know the truth?
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:41:47
i don't read Mother Jones too often, but i do remember reading some ridiculous articles from David Corn on there (hes one of the mani conspiracy nuts pushing the fake news conspiracy theory that Trump colluded with Russia to affect the 2016 election) Once I saw that level f nonsense, I knew that MJ had gone from just being leftwing to full on leftist propaganda. 
i mean, all the sites (left AND right) have *some* fake news, but when i see the [trump russia collusion]( stories (rachel meadow has lost her mind on them too) I know that whatever site there on is just pure fakenews
Nonetheless, i used to be a leftist, and i still get my news from ALL sources and sides... and i like to kept up to date on what everyone is saying.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:49:04
you sound like a liberal
don't you know the difference between climate and temperature?
this how liberals talk, oh "its hot where i am, that means global warming alarmism is real"
or 'look, there was a fire in california, that means global warming caused it"
look, the planet might have warmed one or two degrees, but its natural, and its no big deal
all this global warming alarmism is just big govt coming up with new schemes to control and tax the people more.
seriously, you need to get woke, and see the truth
global warming is no big deal, and definitely the costly so-called "solutions" that big govt wants to enact won't do anything
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:12:04
thanks 
makes sense
people are starting to figure this out
once more know, my prediction will come true
my prediction is that bitcoin will be worth $1K by the end of the year
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:20:30


sorry buddy, but i don't take investing advice from strangers on the internet
i think its gonna crash even harder, and deeper
but much like holding onto a lottery ticket that i already bought (as opposed to trying to sell it at a price much lower than i paid for it) 
I'll just hold on to the bitcoin i already have.
it'll probably just go down, down, down, even more...
but its just money that i can afford to lose (although, i'd rather not lose it).
but, i made my choice, i'll roll the dice and HODL onto the bitcoin i have purchased.  I am not expectinganything from bitcoin, but if it somehow magically comes back up, i'll be happy to get my money back
and if it doesnt, then i'll just be like "oh well, at least i tried"
All of which is to say, yes... i still think bitcoin is a shitty investment that will keep on going down, but i'm gonna hold onto it, and see what happens ...just in case.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:53:03
don't u know how to google?
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:50:43


i hope youre right
my opinion differs from yours 
but hey... i guess we'll just wait and see
and to answer your final question, there are many ways it could die off.
3 most obvious are that:
- a better crypto asset comes along (bitcoin is over a decade old, in technology terms, thats ancient, so a new/better asset comes along that is demonstrably better is certainly possible)
- a big company (apple, google, amazon, microsoft, etc) creates a new crypto asset and surpasses bitcoin, perhaps they even offer fraud protection the way a real bank or credit card does? and that new crypto asset takes over the market (even if its not better, with an advertising campaign, and ability to pressure nearly all merchants into taking it, it could surpass bitcoin).
- there are advances in quantum computing, and all of a sudden it becomes possible for any advanced quantum computer to easily crack bitcoin encryption.  if this happens then bitcoin goes to zero.
those are just 3 other possible ways that bitcoin dies off, or become worthless or near worthless.  There are probably 100 possible scenarios or tech advances, that could lead to the fall of bitcoin (thats not to say it will definitely fail, but its definitely possible).

nice conspiracy theory
what's next? are you going to claim UFOs are secretly ruling the planet?
enough with the made up stories, and lets stick to the correct topic (which is bitcoin, not *conspiracy theories*)
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:54:45
its actually worst than 00.00
because, you buy bitcoin at a certain price, and then it becomes worth even less with each passing day.
bitcoin just turns whatever money you put into it, and makes it worth less each month.
losing money on bitcoin is like having a bill that you pay every month, but get nothing else in return from.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:40:48
you are 100 percent wrong in your segments about me
thanks for the laugh
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:53:06

fingers crossed
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:11:40
oh sure you do
you only talk with those who think exactly as you do, but I'm the one who is childish?
ok, whatever you say.
Once again, youre on here personally insulting me, and not talking about bitcoin.
I, on the other hand, whenever i post an original comment, its always about bitcoin
i post about bitcoin, you post to insult fellow users
hmmm, i wonder who is the real adult here?
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:24:58

if you love cheap bitcoin, you are going to love the end of december 2018
its only gonna keep crashing (my guess is that by the end of the year bitcoin will be down to just 5% of what it was at the end of december 2017)

@_date: 2018-12-07 00:38:18


you might have been correct the first 329 times
but not this time.  its not dead (yet) but its pretty close to being dead.
It will be down to $1K by the end of 2018
and after that, it will just be a $1K shitcoin that will slowly dwindle away (bitcoin is already a fucking joke at this point, once it hits $1K no one will care (other than a few desperate holders who won't let go to shitcoin bitcoin no matter what.)

this is 100% correct
it might win, but (my opinion) odds are most likely that it will die off 
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:22:46
thats good to hear
i live in a city (los angeles) where if i were to even wear a MAGA hat, I would get jumped and beaten (and definitely yelled at and spit on)
and if i were to put a Trump bumper sticker only car, my car would get keyed or vandalized
and as i work in the film/TV industry, I can never mention that i like Trump at work or i'd be fired and blacklisted from future jobs.
basically, where i live (in hollywood) the left wing people are totally violent and will attack and rage out on any Trump supporters.  So, all Trump supporters have to be undercover. 
Anyway, that youre the type of progressive who does not want to be violent or hateful towards a Republican Trump supporter like me is a hopeful sign.  I wish there were more people like you here in LA.
Thanks for the positive and friendly message, and good luck to you in your path!

another dip downward
i wanted to be wrong with my prediction that I have been making all year (that bitcoin will be down to $1-2K but he end of the year).
sadly, it looks like i will be correct.
bitcoin just keeps crashing, every month in 2018 is worse than the month before.
at this rate, bitcoin become a near-totally-worthless shitcoin by the end of 2019
and all those saying "oh great, i love these lower prices, i am just gonna buy more bitcoin now"
um, ok.  its a free country, spend your money as you wish.  personally, i think that bitcoin is now the worst investment possible.
of course... just sharing my honest opinion (and correct predictions) will have many on here downvoting and attacking me, and saying i am spreading FUD
Nooo, I am NOT spreading FUD
you know what is spreading FUD?  what's spreading FUD is the fact that bitcoin has lost 80% of its value in less than one year, and that its *still* crashing down hard, with no end in sight.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:54:06
yes, in 2019 it will do poorly
in 2020 it either dies, or recovers (its too early to tell)
