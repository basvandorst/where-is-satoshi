You don't have to trust me. Upvote if you like the idea. Downvote if you don't. It's reddit! ;)

"Dear Senator Coburn,
I recently heard that the US Marshals office will be selling 50,000 Bitcoins that were siezed and currently being held by the United States Government.  I was considering participating in the auction, however I am very concerned that you have been quoted by journalist Ken Hess as stating that 'Bitcoins are Illegal'.
Before I contact the US Marshals office to ask them for clarification on your position, I thought I would contact you directly.
Ken Hess summarizes your statement in his article: 
'Senator Tom Coburn's office finally got around to answering my letter concerning the illegality of Bitcoin. **I'm happy to report that he agrees with me that bitcoin is illegal in the United States.**'
Can you please clarifiy whether or not you believe that Bitcoins are illegal, or has Ken Hess misrepresented your statement in his article?
The US Marshals office stands to generate upwards of $25,000,000 in revenue for the US government from this auction, so I think it's important to clarify whether or not journalists have the facts right. 
I look forward to your clarification on this matter.
Best Regards,
*Your name here*"
EDIT:  
*Taking the angle here invovling the US Marshalls auction is the surest way to have the Senator clarifiy his statement.  We all know that the US government loves money, and right now Ken Hess is* **fucking with the US governments' ability to generate revenue**, *; using Senator Coburn as his weapon.  I'm sure the Senator would be quite upset to know that a journalist is using him as fodder to stand in the way of a $25,000,000 payday for the government, and would be happy to clarifiy the position of all regulators that bitcoins are not 'illegal in the united states'.*

Ken Hess has written an article stating that Senator Coburn believes Bitcoin is illegal.  Senators are responsible for creating new laws in the country.  If this is truly his position (as the journalist states),  I would like clarification from him before participating in the US Marshals Bitcoin auction, which of course is being conducted by the US government,.
