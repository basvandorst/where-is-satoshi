So, not to sound new, but .. what are these community's views on the bittit.info website?
I ask because, if that service is viewed positively, we could use some more content in the NSFW section .. yes/no? :3

Hey, just an update..
I started using a RAMdisk. Takes a reliable 60 seconds to copy the blockchain to RAMdisk, a reliable 4.5 minutes to write it back..
and a reliable ZERO ANYTHINGS to update 24 hours of transaction infos! xD xD xD
I don't even get more than one connected node before it's done. I don't even get a status bar. What in the actual fuck? xD
So I agree wholeheartedly on the "satoshi client needs optimizations" front.
This begs the next question: is there actually an command flag to load the wallet from file X and the rest of the data directory from location Y? Because then I could keep only the wallet on the stick, and copy blockchain back and forth from ram disk more easily from the local HDD. :Q__

yay whatsa firstbits? :3
Is that, like, a globally unique payment address prefix? and what happens i it stop be's'n unique? Would it be like, you advertise firstbits, and then a collision happens and your ad be broke? Or is it just X chars is unique enough to make collisions especially improbable?
Do the vanialla bitcoin client support it? :D  (disclaimer: I'd google all this but I'm on mobile til tomarrah and the browser is not working, just reddit app :P)

I considered that, but I've a quad core at 1% or less on all cores. :&lt;

What does IO bound mean here, though?
If I can read and write simultaneously, random access, at 2 megabytes per second (35 MBps serial), and I've got 8 gigs of RAM, what's taking so long to download and verify 150 blocks averaging 10k apiece, or about 1.5 megabytes of data? God damn, if they need millions of random access requests to the blockchain for verification, why not have the option to take 60 seconds to load the gig of data from the stick into RAM and then verify it from there? 
Is there an option to have the blockchain in directory A and the wallet in location B? If so, then I'd have no problem loading the blockchain into a RAM disk myself if it will help, then copying it back to permanent storage when done.
Additionally, prior to the USB key I had the same problem on a 7200rpm 500GB SATA drive.
Does anybody have actual I/O numbers? Short of that, how is anyone even using bitcoin unless they're running it 24/7 from their computer or mounting the data directory on a nine disk striped raid array? When I dump a gig of data into an sqlite database on a USB stick I can still make over a thousand single-row random access database reads per second.
Lol, this is just really frustrating. xD

And then, as much as I wanted to upvote, I found that my mouse had already navigated itself over there and clicked of it's own accord. curses! xD

Sweet beans, thanks for the explanation. :D

Yes, I am using 0.6 of the satoshi client. Checked it was the latest version at bitcoin.org on Apr 10.
I don't know if my USB key is the limiting factor. The Bitcoin client has been slow since before I started using the USB key. I just got done 7zipping a 2.5GB folder full of tiny files from the USB key to the USB key (so both read and write; 2GB compressed) and it took 15 minutes at an average of 2.7MBps. 
I am using a USB key because that is one of the prefered methods mentioned at the bitcoin wiki to [secure your wallet]( It reduces the surface area of attack if someone wants to steal my wallet file, the deed must be done during the window of time I have my USB key plugged in. It also allows me to use the USB key at many trusted terminals (I have 4 computers at my house, 2 workstations at work and a laptop I'm taking on vacation soon).


That is something I would love to try. Is there an option to support it? The wiki can only recommend the -datadir option, but that moves where the blockchain gets stored too.
ty for your input! :3
