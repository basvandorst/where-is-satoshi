It was a quick adjustment of another one I made I admit lol but the PSD is streamline enough for easy adjustments and swapouts hopefully

Not to be used as is of course; just an advertisement for the PSD which can be edited to suit any taste or denomination

Yep the parent folder of both sides has a colour overlay that I may have put too low saturation on; just tinker with that parent folder and you will be able to adjust the colour of everything in one go

Hi everyone. I'm making cold wallets for a few cryptos that I'm sharing in the vein of real life currency notes.
Here's the PSD for this one 
It's separated into 2 folders in the main one for front and back of note design. There is a little tab that acts as a foldaway to hide the private key once its printed.
Here's the approximation of the front and back of the notes within the PSD
Front: 
Back: 
Fonts used in the PSD are
Gill sans family
Khmer UI
Helvetica Family
But feel free to change anything you wish
*There is a note in the PSD about the bitcoin symbol on the bottom left by the value. It is rasterised with a floating pixel which touches the leftmost digit on the preceding number for consistent spacing. All other text for denominational breakdown is fully editable. Sorry about my lack of commas my keyboard has broken
