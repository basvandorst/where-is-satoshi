Yes, it's all about motivation.  I don't see P2P auctions providing enough of a benefit to the buyer to make it worth learning.

What I wish I could say to Lawsky:  That the bitcoin ecosystem is developing it's own consumer protections.
For one thing, everyone now knows that it's a bad idea to leave a lot of money sitting in an exchange.
For another, multi-sig is slowly coming to fruition.  Multi-sig allows for the convenience of online access to your money, combined with the safety and security of holding your own private keys.  It's the best of both worlds.
Escrow services will become available that let the consumer make the decision if they want to pay more for purchase protection, or to simply "self-insure" for small purchases.
The distributed and cryptographic nature of bitcoin means that new and innovative solutions for consumer protection can be implemented without central regulation.
It moves from a mindset of "punish the violators after the fact" to "prevent the problems before they happen".
But none of this can happen if innovation is stifled at this early juncture.
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:01:30

It's not the $5 items that are a problem.
Recently I bought a motherboard from NewEgg that went up in smoke a few hours after I turned it on.  I sent it back to NewEgg and they looked at it, said it was my fault (it wasn't), and wouldn't refund my money.
I was able to use the threat of a chargeback to eventually get a full refund.
A little known facet of the chargeback is the subsequent increase in transaction costs to the merchant if they get too many.  So chargebacks not only act as refund mechanisms, but as a sort of reputation system as well.  They help keep merchants in line.
At some point, a third party has to be involved to mediate disputes.  And of course they need to be paid to do their work.  So we are sort of right back to the credit card system again.
Basically I think that bitcoin needs some kind of adjunct insurance system so that there is a pool of money to pay fraud claims, and also a reputation management system so that there is a financial penalty for bad merchant behavior.
Maybe there should be a two tiered system -- regular bitcoins for small purchases where the consumer is willing to absorb the risk, and a more complex system for larger purchases where mediation may be needed.
You could even let the banks be involved in a competitive manner.  If it was easy for the consumer to choose a different mediation provider for every purchase, it would foster competition to provide low fees and better service.

Just because everyone is doing it doesn't make it OK.
In the early days of the web, it was commonly accepted that you should not be able to determine if someone has an account on a particular service just by using their email address.

the arrival of news happens all at once, causing everyone to buy or sell at the same time.  This reduces liquidity on the other side of the trade.  If everyone wants to sell, and few want to buy, the price drops rapidly, and vice versa.
The passing or fading of news is a gradual process, and the resulting orders are more spaced out, resulting in slower price movements.
Also, people tend to be slow to reverse their opinion, so a lot of the people who sold won't be in the mood to buy again right away.
