we had an interchange agreement that was low by industry standards of $.25 per transaction + 1.5%.  and the funds were in my account the next day.  
so even with that deal, i would have been excited to accept digital currencies at nearly no transaction cost, but only if i could get the coins converted to dollars and into my account the next day (or if i had a food supplier that would accept coins as payment, that would be ok too if i had the coins available immediately)
I closed my restaurant before the obamacare law went into effect though.  there was no way i could keep it afloat after being forced to provide health insurance to drivers and cooks.  (it was a takeout joint)  the taxes that were already in plave were destroying us anyway.

nothing can save them.  their disease is terminal.  its an overwhelming government entitlement mentality that is killing them.  you could pay their people $200k per year and their union would say they are underpaid.  
they are also infected with terminal redtape virus.  their rules create such horrible customer service.  
a story.  i used to publish free newspapers in a suburban zip code.  even though USPS is already going to every home in the zip every day, it would cost me $.17 a home for delivery.  So I hired a staff and paid them $.06 a home.  What did the USPS do?  They found that one of my delivery people put a newspaper in the lower box, underneath the mail box, but was sticking out an inch.  they took every newspaper they found the rest of the route and tried to charge me postage because "the federal government owns the mailbox, the flag, and the air around the mailbox in a plane above and below the slot where mail is placed."  apparently airplanes passing overhead are violating usps airspace.  
so i started delivering the papers directly to people's doorknobs and published pictures of the mailman asleep in his truck on city property, which happened several days per week.

bubbles happen when "everyone" agrees there is no way the investment in question could ever lose value and they will not tolerate anyone attempting to question it.  
they happen when the least knowledgable people are interested in it and investing.  
they happen when "all" the sellers capitulate and theres nobody left to buy from.  
are we there yet?  are we getting close?
when you hear morons at the grocery store talking about bitcoins, and see it on the evening news, and prices are going through the roof, and people are saying "can we even ASK if this is overvalued without being shouted down?" and you cant find anyone you know willing to sell...

in your mind you are going through a (false) circular reasoning that because the fed inflation figures report stability that the dollar is stable.  it is not.  businesses are absorbing the difference in their margins.  firms are creating the perceived consumer stability.

(speaking in aggregates) when china receives US Dollars for exports they can be exchanged for a currency they need because they have to pay for a trade deficit with some other nation (not happening), they can purchase US assets like real estate or stocks, they can use them to buy oil  gold, or heroin/cocain, (so long as us firms are in control of the industry, which means so long as the us military is in control of the oil and poppy fields), or they can buy US government debt (or simply hold the dollars...same thing almost)
What China is saying here is they dont want to play the game that keeps these dollars offshore; they will start buying us real estate and when those dollars come home we will have inflation.

next you'll be sending your account numbers to the prince of nigeria who needs your help to create banking relationships despite his billions in wealth.

if that began to happen the government will destroy net neutrality, pass anti-defamation laws similar to alien and sedition acts, increase surveillance of all electronic communications, strictly regulate all electronic transactions, force crypto-currency miners and exchanges into SEC and Banking Laws, and if necessary, virtually shut down the internet.  
this game is rigged guys.  bitcoin is noble but it cant shift power away from the elites who run things.  only guns can do that.

at what point will the credit card companies threaten to pull their machines for accepting btc?  
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:30:29
i always saw the potential in bitcoin.  but like i told you, that ridiculous run up was a pump and dump and i was absolutely right not to buy it the day it was 1200 and you were braying like a donkey with the others that it was going to 10,000.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:19:45
typical sheltered liberal authority fetish keynesian tool.

i agree.

so are you saying Jews really do run the banking world?  
or are you saying that anyone criticizing banking is probably an anti-semite?
what exactly should we take from this?  
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:13:27
it wont be bitcoins though.  and they wont be truly decentralized.  thats a threat to power, and power is not going to permit it.  these little phony quips of support are to get the dumb money to buy.

smart money gets in first.  dumb money gets in last.  i'll let you decide which group the evening action news crowd is, buying something thats run from $3 to $450 and they dont even know how they work or what it is.

hi.  you lost 50% on that bid at 900 in 2 days.  still think this is going to 10,000?
Crazy BitCoin trading, price off 50% from recent high (after big rally following SilkRoad plunge)
talk to you again after this gets whacked for another couple hundred bucks.  
even i thought it would hold its ground longer than 2 days.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:38:37
i promised once your theory was completely destroyed we would revisit this thread.  the pump and dump is now obvious.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:55:30
i love people like you.

its capitalism that creates an incentive for cooperation!
your presupposition which has no support is contradicted by every voluntary exchange a billion times a day!
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:52:19
if you were paid in bitcoins last week at $1300 per and didnt immediately convert (which takes time and labor, a cost that is ignored) you would be holding bitcoins today worth $750.
if that isnt all you need to know as a business person right now, you have some false premises in your head holding your business back in probably a dozen other ways.  
the only reason to accept bitcoins right now is if you want to do it as a political or social statement.  (a statement about decentralization and sovereign man which i fully support, by the way).

we'll talk again soon.  maybe in a week or two, maybe longer, but when these things are 30 bucks a pop again, we'll revisit this thread.

wage slavery is a misnomer.  wages are voluntary.  the slavery is the hours you work while the government strips the income from you.

i said a couple weeks ago that the hedge funds drove this growth spurt and i was downvoted and attacked mercilessly.  
if you need more evidence than the insiders on tv suddenly pumping something like this to know they are invested in it (through  hedge funds) then we need to have a talk about why you still believe in the easter bunny and low cost public health care.

where this is going;
youre against the Fed because its a privately controlled currency that can be manipulated, but you support bitcoin even though its a privately controlled currency that can be manipulated....
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:42:22
and i advocated nothing.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:25:25
actually inflation is an increase in money supply.  prices are rising, just not in consumer goods.  but they will. QE will not be without consequence.

i would still vote for snowden, though the pope turning against capitalism will probably be more popular with the true believer leftists at the guardian.

When Elon Musk threw his hands up and said "fine, YOU build it" regarding his plans for a high speed transport train in california, I thought of Atlas Shrugged.  
Now the government is holding hearings and threatening his Tesla Motors over ridiculous safety concerns; while ignoring "Government Motors" (GM) safety issues which are objectively and measurably far worse.  
Galt's Gulch is, I believe, the first of what will be many similar projects.  
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:29:50
i dont know if its a fact or not, but ive heard it said that western union is the number one brand identity among african americans, largely because checksystems blocks so many poor americans from opening traditional checking accounts.  i dont think this community will be techie types with computers and home internet using bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:07:49

enlighten me about how a run from 300 to 1000 in a week or 2 is not speculation, but actual organic investment growth.  
I'd love to hear you justify how this is not being pumped by manipulators looking to milk the dumb money.  
unless whoever picked up silk road's customers just had a 10,000,000% increase in demand, there is nothing you can buy with btc that you cant buy with usd.  so lets hear how this rush to obtain btc is anything other than wild swings by speculators.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:52:09
youre a true believer type.  you dont know how this game is played.  nothing i could say would sink in.  
soon youll see articles about "hedge funds showing interest and doing due diligence".  those articles will mean they are already deeply in and ready to sell.

yeah, theres quite a debate about that.  he accepts the label, but certainly accepts corporate welfare.  but i look at it this way, you dont blame a prisoner for accepting and eating the food thrown in his cell.
