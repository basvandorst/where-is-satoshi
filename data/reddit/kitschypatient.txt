Pretty sure he was already using crypto 4 years ago. Poker players were among the very early adopters. Seal with clubs was a popular bitcoin pokersite founded in 2011.

you can log in to gdax.com using your coinbase credentials. You can then choose to deposit BTC from your coinbase wallet (instant &amp; free) Then use Gdax to send your BTC to anywhere you want (for free)

Relax. Just wanted to show that pokerplayers were very early adopters, and used it as an example. Was it crowded? no. But everyone knew it. Professional pokerplayer is cool and all, but how much did you lose?

don't know, I've been verified for a while, so no idea how that limits the usability of gdax

You have to look at things objectively. I want Bitcoin to work, because I believe in what it stands for and what it could mean to the world.   
I know most people here are just hoping to score a lambo or 2, but call me a fool for believing what this could really lead to.  
I worked for NGO's &amp; charities and getting money to 3rd world countries, villages where you could save thousands of lives, is extremely hard if they don't have a bankingsystem in place. Trying to get money to a remote place on this planet quickly can cost you hundreds, if not thousands of euro's/dollars. Getting it there fast and a lot cheaper could save more lives than you and I can possibly comprehend.  
That being said, I enjoy trading on exchanges, and I use Ripple to send money from one to another exchange. It's super fast and cheap, two things you can not claim Bitcoin is at this point. But it could still get there.  
By the end of this post, I forgot why it was important to include starving villages in it.

Thanks for the help! Unfortunatly, I have no clue what you mean.

Ripple is on Bitstamp, Kraken, Binance, Bittrex etc. If there is a coin as widely accepted with the same speed and low cost, I'll gladly switch. I just look at it as a tool, a vessel.

Obviously funny, Was actually trying to figure out why sometimes a block takes so long to get confirmed. It took around 50 mins between 501679 and 501680.  
I should really learn how all of this works.
