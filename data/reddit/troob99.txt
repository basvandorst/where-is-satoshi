has anyone seen the bid order to buy over 1000 bitcoins @ $1030 then was removed after 30 seconds... someone is trying to push the bots to buy 
edit: actually it's still in the order book for 1181 coins @ $1020
Edit(bis): it's gone again

if you look here  you will see the order book live and yes, someone (probably mt gox) is putting large buy orders at 850 to prevent it to fall below, but how long can it keep up ?

How are you going to price your derivatives?

I just noticed that the fee I paid wasn't anywhere near 1mBTC it was only 0.1mBTC that a lot better

Thanks for your reply; yeah I insisted a little and it finally worked. Great App! thanks !

Who will ? There was like a 100 K sell volume in 1 hour. It's most likely that MT. Gox kept buying at 850-875 and now the buy pressure is f'ing lame. This is what is more commonly called a "bull trap"

I actually made all my pizza back and a little extra (22mBTC) so free lunch :/ don't know if this si good, it could have gone the other way i guess, lucky day^9
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:58:17
this is exactly what I was looking for
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:25:12
why can't I download the app on my phone :((((( it's loading then stops and asks me to click on install again and again
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:51:36
Basically there is a delivery website called 'pizza.be' which accepts bitcoins and they handle the rest :) there's over 100 delivery food shops and you can pay with bitcoins for almost every single one of them

I thought it was the LEA who was trying to disrupt the rally dumping their 140K coins to destroy the coin. Still today, dumping 140K on any exchange will bring the coin to around 500USD lol (I'm just guessing I can't see the depth any further than for 4000 coins which corresponds to 900 USD)

hahaha! this made me laugh soo much !
