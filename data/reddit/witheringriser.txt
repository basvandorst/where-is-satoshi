Well there’s two ideas about CME and CBOE futures going around:
1. Many people will short BTC, driving the price down and causing a major dip. This makes sense, since a massive correction usually happens with BTC once a month, and the futures release a month after the last major correction. 
2. A lot of new money from institutions will enter the stage. Even though futures don’t deal directly with buying BTC, BTC will get more attention from institutions who might then decide to start investing, driving the prices up.
Either way, we should all pay close attention to the price action when futures release Dec 10 and 17 and act accordingly.

I’ve been waiting to invest since mid-October. I waited to my exchanges to be verified and they finally did. I could have bought it at the 8.7k dip a week ago but I thought it would go lower. Now I’m massively struggling  not to buy it now, because every day it goes up without a dip. I know not to buy at ATH’s but this is incredibly hard as every day is a new ATH.

Less fees basically. 0.15% per trade on pro if you make a limit order
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:46:09
I guess they don’t want to confuse people. Most people who trade via apps are newer to crypto and just want a simple interface so they keep pro out of sight

Sweden is going completely cashless by 2030, scary control for the central banks and all in the name of making it harder for criminals to store their money (as if banning cash will solve crime)
