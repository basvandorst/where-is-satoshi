Eh, sure - why not.  I don't think I've revealed any trade secrets of any use to our competition - we are Quantek Instruments, manufacturers of O2 and CO2 analysis equipment:

Very good point.  That's why I think extreme volatility is very bad in the long run for BTC adoption.   But as adoption grows, hopefully the bids and the asks will get tighter, and the price fluctuations will be more like any other cross-currency exchange rate - sure, there will be wild days, but I only look at the EUR/USD rates maybe every few weeks.

And you want to know what's even worse?  I've based my calculations on a typical order.  If that customer comes back and needs a $500 replacement part, getting the actual funds - the $500 - to us, will in total cost more than the delivery of the part.  All these steps - having a driver pick it up at our facility, deliver it to an airport, load it on a plane, clear it through customs, load it on another truck, and drive it to the outskirts of Hyderabad, costs LESS than moving around ledger entries in the banking system.  How can that be?   It's ponderous!!!

I would guess that we'd convert instantly to fiat... until some of our vendors accept BTC.  I tend to be very risk averse when it comes to the company finances, despite my personal opinion of Bitcoin's long term potential.
Also, as part of the management team, the worst distraction I could imagine is holding BTC in large amounts and getting into a discussion about when to convert to fiat.  Running a business has enough distractions... I like to keep everyone focused on the products, the market, and the customers... not the ticker

so they went USD -&gt; EURO -&gt; USD?  Betcha someone lost a good 10% right there, if not more....

It's maddening.  
I've even had situations where someone wired us money once - no intermediary fee.  They wired us money again - same bank, same sender &amp; receiver account - $30 intermediary fee.   
I just don't get for the life of how a system that has been in place for about 40 years can have a transaction fee determined at random.

Haha, exactly.  You read my mind.

We had one customer - once - pay via WU.  It cost him $50 to send us $950 - he had to do paperwork, I had to send someone down to WU to pick it up.... still too time consuming.
And I'm not sure I understand your point - we couldn't take payment in physical objects (unless someone wanted to Fedex us cash).  Convert anything (other than BTC) to USD, or any other currency, and you'll get reamed.  Go down to the local "We buy gold!" shop and see how much less they give you than the NYMEX spot price... it's probably about 10%.

Probably about 30-40% is repeat business.     
And while we only directly pay about 5 or 6 foreign vendors (the rest is sourced through U.S. based sales reps), the rest of the world is used to prepaying for B2B goods through wire transfer - it's really the only way right now to move money across borders for business transactions.  
  
Even for the customers we trust, and granted them net 30 terms, what happens when they mistakenly cut a check for 1000 Euro and we go to deposit it in our bank?  I shudder to think what that will cost and how long it'll take to clear.  (to be honest I don't have the slightest idea)

We'll never require it - but we will offer incentives for those who choose to pay with BTC.   It's kind of similar to a quantity discount; you can choose to purchase one at a time (totally up to you), but if you buy five at once, it's more efficient and we can cut your price.
You can still choose to wire us funds, or - just as an example - you can send us BTC and we'll split the shipping with you.  
And as someone who has had to pay foreign vendors via wire, it's no picnic.  If they're not on file, you sit in the bank branch while they decipher insane foreign addresses and fill out incredible forms (and pay $35 for the privilege).  I've even faxed them the information ahead of time and it never seems to go quite right.  
If my vendors offered to split the shipping with me if I paid with BTC I wouldn't hesitate for a millisecond... just to spare myself from having to explain to a branch teller that the beneficiary in India's street address really is "Plot 922 Behind the Co-Op Society" !
