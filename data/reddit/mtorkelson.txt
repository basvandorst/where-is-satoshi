So what will the price drop to when the SEC denies the ETF again? Or will it increase because it's good for the whales..

Watch how ignored this comment will just lie here on this thread. Stagnant. Like an observant requiem shark in the blanket of the ocean. They are most certainly among us..

Don't be mad at not knowing the future. Hindsight makes it easy to beat yourself up. I would recommend GDAX, free trades on limit orders and it's a good platform. Also, don't get too emotionally involved or you'll lose your ass. Let what I've learned be your crystal ball. Keep yourself informed and when in doubt HODL!

What I like to do is just one cryptocurrency at a time that way it's easier to manage all the legitimate news regarding that specific one. Having said that, cryptocurrencies are all experiencing a relative boom recently so diversifying might be a good idea instead. ~having said that, there's a lot of people who would rather make no interest in a savings account rather than having to manage the risk of owning cryptocurrency- but you live on the edge like most of us here that won't cut it anyway lmfao. Also you don't need an economics class, just don't do stupid shit like not staying informed on a basic level or maybe valuing propaganda too much/allowing yourself to become the frog who's unable to acknowledge himself dying in a boiling pot of water (market w/ influx of negative shitt!) Haha. Or just say screw it, I'm roofying myself and buying BTC so when I wake up I'll have no recollection and won't know I own it until I get reminded sometime down the line. BTCs price might be high right now, but this may just be the beginning. Welcome
