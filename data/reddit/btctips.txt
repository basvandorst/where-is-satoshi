I heard xapo is getting sued into oblivion by lifelock. :/

Thanks, that was the other one I was looking at.

This. Leads only one option Trump.
@_date: 2016-06-29 03:44:56
Trump for sure.
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:09:55
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:24:03
Well DUH of course he is going to win. You have to be utterly retarded to vote for anyone else but Trump.

Seriously, its pretty amazing how long I've been addicted to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:02:20
Simple . A one for all merchant button that allows any merchant to receive crypto ( not just bitcoin ) on their website. The idea is to allow anyone ( without signing up ) accept crypto - think of it like spreading the banner exchanges back in the AOL days on everyones website.  Merchants can simply fill out the items they want to sell in whatever coin and it pre-fills with the proper addresses to receive payment.  As it stands, Coinbase you have to sign up to, shapeshift is the closest but doesn't allow you to designate items you are selling.  This should be embeddedable. Lets do this!
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:33:19
Interesting perspective.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:16:53
sweet! I'll have to make my way down there this 4th :)

Interesting way to find r/bitcoin.

9th richest brother in the world.
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:21:04
Good question.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:28:43
Yes, sir. Adoption, adoption and adoption. You would think this has been done but it hasn't. Merchants can set it so coins are sent to exchanges to cash out or if its BTC to coinbase,circle wherever.  The idea is to just provide an easy copy and paste mechanism to get into crypto/Bitcoin for them.  Even if the merchant isn't fully committed they could receive just an email of the order to show them people are willing to pay for the item in crypto. I should have mentioned this is best for existing websites who already have a 'cart' if there was a way to scrap the sites items and apply a "crypto cart' like hover button above so the cart just sets up top right without having to actually be part of the current check out process if you get my drift. The idea actually is to let existing merchants adopt crypto overnight.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:39:32
Yes, via email. I bet the whole/transaction process could take place via email/in email.

Well its just open and no those aren't bots.
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:48:51
For the time being. Is there interest in a male one?

If you tip there I'll double your tip lol
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:58:34
edit: sorry, some reason the main is showing up sometimes here and not but here was hence the deletion. 
Not a bad suggestion. Since this is invite only, this could be easily implemented and required. Like said any photo can be altered to have a QR code on them ,but this can be a 2nd sort of method. The way it stands ea. girl is vetted one and a time and seems to working good.
Answer to your new question:
The idea of the QR code on a clean piece of paper makes more sense. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:09:53
Yes. Def. come on over!
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:03:39
Have him come over to !

That is a good point.

@_date: 2015-11-08 05:23:53
yes ?
@_date: 2015-10-04 22:27:38
So my question is I remember back in the day I got this from IBB . Way back in like 2013 or so. I'm wondering how I find out if there are any Bitcoins on it ? I see the redeemable private key but there seems to be nothing underneath it , or what am I'm doing wrong ?
edit: I should have put this on imgur ugh sorry about that all.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:31:18
Correct. The bot doesn't delve deeper down the tree (yet) of comments . Your solution does sound interesting  and can be looked at , as commentators might have something 'better' to add to it. Good suggestion.
Edit: I got your other aspect on the edit. Right, not everyone is going to post information underneath the original OP. This is why there is the description so when people do click on OP's link it says what it is. I get what you are getting at and you provide an interesting idea.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:29:14
Not a problem. Yes, there is some room to work with. Everything is a work in progress ,even as we speak now. I think one way to look at TipHound is sort of content management solution on the places that matter. I don't know much about Bandcamp.  Do they have ChangeTip enabled as a tipping option to music artists there ? If so, the way it works now is people tip the artist and the artist collects and that is it . What if the artist wants to push out new material to everyone + receive the tips ?  You sort of develop a full-cycle feedback loop as everyone gets something for their action. Not only that, they have a teaser on the new product ( the file being sent out ) , and would like to upgrade to a bigger bundle they can purchase directly from their content page. You effectively transitioned a curious customer into a full-fledged buyer. More important where is it taking place ? Not on bandcamp, but on Reddit. Next could be Twitter.... Hopefully, this make more sense. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:51:06
Excellent! looking forward to you returning!
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:45:19
Hi! they can see it ? The person can put in the 'description' of their previous works just like anything else. There is no sweat off anyone back tipping 1 bit right ? Also, in the works of putting up a more 'store' qualities that some are asking for. Because, I guess tipping 1 bit for stuff goes against all the internet rules lol...
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:53:13
10 bits good one! 
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:19:13
They have to start an OP on it to have people tip against it. They can't just share it in comments. The actual file could be shared, but that already happens to this day. People buy stuff and share the actual original file all over.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:47:04
I guess its how you look at it.  I don't see giving someone 10 bits a 'paywall' . But, it's all matter of perception.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:10:37
I think there is a happy medium. I know people always ask , why would you pay for free content ? I think there is something intriguing about what someone thinks is worth something and w/ the invention of Bitcoin as a micropayment source we are able to experiment and see where this goes. There may be nothing there , but lets find out.  After here some feedback today, TipHound can provide some solutions:  
1.  Still keep things FREE as anyone can post for free on the subreddit and still get tips the traditional way.
2.  Voluntarily Tip away ,but up-sell on the content landing page for the content producer ( direct purchase ) so they end up getting the best of both worlds.
At the end of the day, it seems to me we are giving people more options while allowing them to sit on top of the places that matter.  Like I said. Like Bitcoin, everything is an experiment. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:20:07
Not entirely sure it's a "paywall" in the traditional sense  . I kind of call it a curiosity wall.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:50:47
Excellent, thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:20:49
This is the most requested feature. I don't see why it can't be implemented at some point.
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:16:41
I see. So a Moniker/specific syntax could trigger it. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:27:09
Noted. Like we just wanted to put this out to see what could be improved upon. Good suggestion!
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:49:40


Maybe , because the person who is posting it has a reputation already ? This will be the obvious goal going forward just like with any online store you shop at now. Keep in mind nobody is forcing you to pay for content that you have no idea how good it is, or relevant to you.


This is why there is a description field. Of course early on there is going to be some crap put up as everyone is just playing about testing and what have you.  What do you do now when you have a dispute ? nothing changes.


It's in the works , a more of a 'rep' based page for each content. Already, being flushed out because I do agree I don't want either a bunch of stuff posted randomly all over it also.  I hear what you are saying!
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:54:41
have a tip! lol 1 bit
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:01:37
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:54:19
ya, looking around for it I see nothing. I can't believe they wouldn't have this.
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:56:14
Yes, I've used them before. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:26:16
Actually, the media asset could reside on the link at TipHound.me like you said  that says you have to tip ( *the landing page you see when you don't tip* ) and let them still release it upon payment . Excellent idea! I might be able to work with some existing services to still let people unlock content on the page you have some thoughts ?
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:59:03
Hi!  Ok, great. I'll give you a message here and we can talk about it for sure. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:00:54
Great to see you are interested. Do you have a particular interest in something ?
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:01:44
Ah! so 'any comment' produces say a 'QR' code/address to pay directly ? Interesting idea.
