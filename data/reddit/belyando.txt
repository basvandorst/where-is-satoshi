Bitcoin is useless, and so are most other crypto "currencies." They are expensive and inefficient to use and will never replace fiat. Moreover, even if a crpyto currency does get huge, it won't be any of the ones you own. It will be one that hasn't been invented yet and will be controlled by not-you.

Market price has nothing to do with mining costs, which are purely computational and increase as fewer and fewer bitcoins are left to mine. Increased market price can only make mining more lucrative.

DCA is supposed to be for investments, not gambling. Anyone DCA-ing at roulette will still lose. In the stock market, it will pay off. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value whatsoever. It's just a conduit for money transfers.

Is bitcoin "money"? Who's using it? Hardly anyone. It's not the "moneyness" of it that is causing its rise. It's the speculation.
But I would argue the moneyness. Is a currency that is divisible to 1/100 millionth any different than a Zimbabwe dollar that hyperinflates to 100 million per USD? If Zimbabwe changed their currency name to Zimbabwe Coin and called it a crypto currency, I have a feeling that it would jump in value just like Ethereum or Bitcoin, because it's not the "moneyness" or the "inherent value" of those crypto currencies that's driving them up. It's nothing but a speculative bubble.
Money is trust. Ok. And who trusts bitcoin. What legitimate business would actually keep a bank account in bitcoin? It would have gone out of business with the last bitcoin crash, years of profits erased in an unstable currency. If money is trust, then bitcoin is NOT money!
Innovative, yes. Lower costs... yes, of quick transactions between currencies, but not if you accepted payment at $2700/bc and then converted back into USD at $2200/bc!
Just stop arguing that there is anything "real" about this. It's a speculative bubble. You aren't using bitcoins for anything, you're just hoping to sell them to a greater fool. That's the definition of a bubble.

Really? And why is it important for everyone to "own" something with no intrinsic value. What would happen if every single person on earth owned enough bitcoins and decided not to buy anymore? What would the market price be then?
It would be zero.
By the way, there are 21 million potential bitcoins, each divisible into 100 million satoshi. That makes 2.1 QUADRILLION satoshi. That's nearly as many satoshi as there are cents in USD. There is no shortage of bitcoin.

I thought I already knew enough about bitcoin to know what it was, but there was one thing in that Adreas Antonopoulos video that did get me thinking, about the total market cap of a crypto currency. That's the only I've heard so far that supports the need for a higher price for the currency. Everything else is water. "Why should Bitcoin be worth anything, when a new crypto-currency can be created tomorrow at a lower price?" I thought. So, if someone needs to transfer billions of dollars, the currency has to have a market cap of at least billions of dollars.
So that's something. But is it really something? Will banks ever need to use Bitcoin to do transfers of billions of dollars? Because if not, if bitcoin will only ever be used for small transactions, then I stick with my assertion that it is inherently worthless except as a conduit for money transfers and there's no reason for anyone to be hoarding it except as pure speculation. And any pure speculation will end in tears.
I didn't have time to look at the other two links yet. Maybe they will convince me otherwise.

You better hope it doesn't get to its true value while you own it. The true value of a bitcoin is approximately $0.00.

Oh, is 2300 cheap? At what point will you think they are expensive? Or will they never be expensive as long as you own them, because you'll keep hoping for more and more gains?
This will end badly.

21 million bitcoins times 100 million satoshi per bitcoin equals 2.1 quadrillion satoshi.
So yes, bitcoin is limited to an unfathomably huge number of units, and not a satoshi more.

Why is Bitcoin such a "unique" opportunity when there is no barrier to entry for other crypto currency like Etherum, Doge Coin, etc? Why would anyone need to OWN or horde bitcoin for any economic use? What would YOU "do" with bitcoin if not just hold it and eventually sell it to a greater fool? If you have no use for it, then it is useless, and you are a speculator pure and simple. If you can make money, do it, but be prepared to lose absolutely everything you put into this. It has NO intrinsic value whatsoever.

Yeah, he only loses if he sells it. Don't worry if it goes down to $1 and you lose 99.998% of your "investment." Just keep holding. Maybe in a few thousand years someone will bid the price up again. You can afford to wait.

None of you are ending 2017 with a profit, so don't worry about it.

I'm not predicting this thing will go to zero from here. It could go to 10k or 100k first. No one knows when a bubble will end. These people are playing a massive game of "deal or no deal" with Howie Mandel. And just like in the show, most will push it too far and lose everything. But some will make a fortune.
There's only one thing I've found so far that remotely suggests WHY bitcoin would need to be worth any more than it is. Bitcoin's market cap, the total of all bitcoins in existence, is about $36 billion (15m coins * 2400). That means that if two banks wanted to send $40 billion to each other, they could not do it with bitcoin. But if the value per coin goes to $10,000, then they could. But will they ever need to? And couldn't they use their own blockchain rather than bitcoin?

Bitcoin can serve for remittances at $100/coin as easily as at $500,000/coin. You convert to bitcoin, send, they convert out of bitcoin. It functions as a tube. You don't need to own the tube for longer than an instant. The only reason bitcoin is at $2400/tube today is because people are hoarding it and bidding it up because someone got them to believe it is the way of the future.
And maybe it is. But you don't seem to have any better understanding about why it is than I do. You're biased by your speculative profits.
MOREOVER, my friend was showing my how you can easily buy bitcoin on the coinbase app. Great! Now I can be free of bank fees! All I have to do is... whoa... [shudders] pay FIVE PERCENT to coinbase EVERY TIME I buy bitcoin!??! I'd rather stick with the banks.
