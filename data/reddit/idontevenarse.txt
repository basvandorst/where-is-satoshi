You can fork from BCH when you think the 2nd layer solution is ready. You're making this shit personal.

It's hilarious to me how people can't see how this is a bubble caused by media attention. There have been 4(?) bubbles before this with people saying the exact thing right before it crashed and burned.

You know what? Fuck Satoshis opinion and fuck Rogers opinion. All I see is that one coin is centralizing and the other isn't.
There is a dirty game being played here, possibly by state actors. Go ahead and ban me like you mods always do with possible dissent.

That's not going to happen though.

It crashed because it's not worth that much. It's going to keep going down to a new "normal" which is probably higher than what the bubble started at. Bubbles are a bitch.

Like say, bch?

What the fuck is up with the transaction fees?

He was in favor of increasing the block size.

LN has been "in 6 months" for years.

Honestly asking one of the 2 subs is just going to give you a biased answer. I've tried multiple times.
The one thing that really stands out is that this sub was banning and removing posts/comments they didn't like up until BCH launched on coinbase. For some weird reason they stopped doing it. I'm actually amazed that I'm not banned yet. And reading bits and pieces on the internet pushed me in the BCH direction because of the Lightning Network. The latter is supposedly the solution for the current congestion on the network(causing high fees) but I think it's also going to centralize the coin. I think it's comparable to using Litecoin for payments and Bitcoin as storage. You need exchanges to reliably do that. Lightning is just going to take Litecoins place in a sense.
And I'm just ignoring the fact that there should have been a solution years ago. BCH already solved this congestion with a very simple change by increasing the block size. And they can keep doing it for quite some time without issues. It's claimed that a block size too high will also cause centralization because you need more bandwidth and storage to support it.

We needed a solution 2 years ago. Bcash has one, core does not. And the proposed solution by core will cause centralization.

He does realize this is a massive bubble about to pop right?

Still higher than pre bubble lol
