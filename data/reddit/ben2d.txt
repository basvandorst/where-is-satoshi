The implication is centralization and control by governments. Right now it’s possible to run a bitcoin full node on most personal computers on a decent connection. Larger blocks mean you’ll need more storage and faster throughout, eventually becoming less feasible for most regular folks at home. If they’re all hosted on AWS or Alibaba servers they could become juicy targets for anyone who disagrees with the network, becoming vulnerable to attack.

These are nodes, different from mining. Nodes are basically a copy of a blockchain stored throughout the world. Hence, decentralized. You certainly can’t mine bitcoin very profitably on AWS or similar.

No pressure - you know what you’re talking about. 
I bet they’ll be trying to frame the conversation as a competition between BTC and BCH, and which one will ‘win’. Eventually there will only be room for one large PoW blockchain but in the meantime, why can’t we all get along? 
BCH is currently a better payments solution but the lightning network promises the same (or more) for BTC while maintaining a much more efficient and secure blockchain. Larger blocks (BCH) will lead to more vulnerable, centralized nodes. Not to mention the possibility of inflation. I hope you can help people understand all this. 
I’m sure you’re up to speed Elizabeth but for those interested [here’s]( an interesting conversation between Gavin Andresen and Pete Dushenski from 2014 for more context.

I agree with you. It appears to be a better payments solution than BTC to an end user today. BCH believers argue this tirelessly. It is capable of handling more transactions per second than BTC but with costly trade offs. I guess I was trying to appeal to BCH supporters in my statement. There are many better payment solutions than BCH out now and on the horizon.

I can’t wait until more people wake up to this understanding. These new platforms (bitcoin, EOS, and others) are going to allow for consensus building among diverse (and local) groups of people that governments can’t compete with.
