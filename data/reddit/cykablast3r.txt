Shhhh.... 
Don't ruin it dude.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:36:27
But they are in charge of it now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:11:44
What? Like it has sentimental value? Is it a fucking store of sentimental value? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:21:55
Yes. The top 1% of the countries like: El Salvador, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda...
The true elite of the world.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:09:22
The point was it is handling more than btc.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:33:43
Cool you understood the joke and took it literally.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:51:37
BTC is meant to be a store of value not a currency. That is what the devs said.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:26:25
Poster probably not from Trumplandia.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:29:07
And then what do you do with the 0.2 btc? You can't eat it, you can't fuck it and it probably won't entertain you for long, so how do you extract the value from btc?
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:45:29
Yeah sure. Whatever floats your boat I guess...
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:14:27
The same WILL happen with LN, since it is even harder to use.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:40:59
You're to welcome.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:46:40
No, but I did try using it in 2002 and it seemed fine.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:36:00
Lies. You are just a Bcash shill.
edit: apparently you fucking idiots actually require the /s
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:32:34
While bitcoin is just at fucking warp speed and has sustainable fees?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:05:54
THIS guy reddits.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:43:40
What the fuck are you on about? Do you know what realising value means? How do you use the value in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:38:22
BTC has problems. You think the price is what makes it better. That’s all. It’s proven use case is holding. All other use cases will just overwhelm the chain. You don’t know this because you don’t really use BTC. You just buy the coin as a speculator.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:18:39
Yes, but how do you realise the value?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:36:25
I probably won't remember to. Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum are making a pretty good go at it, but there are scalability issues there that might also fuck everything up (also ETH does not aim to be a currency). All things considered Bitcoin seems to be doing pretty bad right now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:09:07
It is? How so?
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:13:32
There is no "besides stupid people".
Stupid people make up a large amount of the population.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:50:55
What? Then how is it a store of value?
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:41:27
How do you realise the value?
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:24:30
Where the fuck did you get that statistic from?
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:42:41
The latter one.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:58:10
Yeah, that's what I thought. You have no fucking clue.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:38:18
[The Ethereum blockchain now processes about as much USD value as all other blockchains combined, **including Bitcoin.**](
How about no?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:01:02
They are still closer than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:57:48
Are YOU drunk?
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:33:27
That's the "raging" part.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:55:17
Oh that's absolutely true. I have no doubt in my mind it could be smooth as silk at that point. I just feel it's going to be too late.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:36:16
You are mistaken. Store of value is what the devs are calling it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:27:54
The fuck do they care?
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:58:29
So why own btc? Why not just own that other coin you use for transfer?
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:12:50
Still not mass adopted...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:16:53
I'm sorry, I kind of lost you at the last sentence?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:56
Yes, just like the time when THE government claimed drugs illegal and everyone lost their drugs. Damn that government!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:46
Could be, could not be.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:30:07
Most of those never really lost their wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:19:28
Oh boy, that is the most wrong anyone has ever been.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:19:13
Yeah that's called trading.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:36:17
Usually nothing happens to them and they live in their ivory tower happily ever after. Welcome to the real world.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:34:31
Finland. Why?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:30:29
I see no reason why not? What the fuck makes bitcoin so special?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:20
That is still honestly not that many.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:20
Oh I see what you mean. But I don't think MOST people ever were that wealthy in those places. It's always been the select few and they never really lost their wealth, It's just that other people got even more wealthier.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:05
As I said. Most people are not that wealthy and never were.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:07:37
Joe absolutely smokes medical, as he did even when you needed a prescription. He has also said he thinks the medical stuff is way stronger.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:37:16
Not true at all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:04
It's actually not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:09:13
How much larger would the HW requirements be if BCH would be as popular as BTC is today?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:26
There are like what, 1000 full bitcoin nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:30:43
A lot of people could though. I'm sure atleast 10000 people could. I don't see how that is a problem. 4x is not much.
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:29:43
Legal action?
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:26:30
No it won't. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:09:35
Yes they do.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:17:46
Already exists.
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:56:08
"A car? Fuck that get a fishing rod!" 
What are you on about mate?
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:31:18
He didn't HAVE to say it. He just liked to.
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:57:04
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:29:25
I guess if you found someone who was tricked into buying bch instead of btc by someone you could have a case. Not sure if that has ever happened.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:42:43
Yes. Lets do that in the spirit of cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:15:17
They were specifically talking about the US.
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:12:27
The money is not physically with you so no. Just like traveling with a debit card.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:39:13
No. Anyone using cash in 2019 will sure as fuck never use a cryptocurrency unless forced to.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:56:13
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:57:27
I don't think we are talking about the same thing here. People seem to be very touchy about this subject.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:28:33
Then you have misunderstood me.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:26:46
Gold is shinier. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:30
Not really. Gold atleast has some use.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:56
But that is talking about saving. Not about bitcoin holding it's value when people start taking their millions out as fiat and not using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:20:34
I am aware of this. People act like i'm saying you shouldn't hold bitcoin and it's going to crash next week. I just gave an answer to a question I can't even remember anymore. People in this sub are really emotional about bitcoin as a subject.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:29:04
If you feel that's good enough to hold bitcoins value forever then ok.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:10
Im not saying it has no use. Im answering the question why hodling and never using bitcoin is bad for its value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:24:14
Bitstamp.net lets you place 10 sms notifs.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:29:15
I read this as being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:58:51
No im simply answering the question why hodling and never spending is bad for bitcoins value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:03
So is bitcoin if it has no use outside of owning it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:35:22
And not a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:31:08
There needs to be usage for the coin to stay valuable.
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:19:00
Do they have a long-term lease on these Reddit posts as well?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:20:36
Which is only a problem for the average joe.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:33:00
My friend, you can always have more money...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:22:24
How does that not support my point?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:37:04
"...can be used to push narratives because people don't read the data." Oh my fucking god. I can not handle the irony.
8800 is a lot of people considering the sample size. The sample size is big and varied enough that it can be considered fairly accurate.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:03:28
Well it's a proof of debt for work done. I work for you for an hour, you give me a note that says you owe me an hours worth of work. I give that proof of debt to someone in exchange for a banana. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:07:37
Yes. And for there to be demand forever there needs to be a use.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:10:23
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:21:23
"Ten thousand men and women aged 20 to 69 across Japan participated." I'd say that's a good enough sample size.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:01:18
Yep. Not arguing you shouldnt just hodl and then sell before the drop. Just answering the question of why holding is bad for bitcoins sustainability.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:55:59
Not a good usage for value is it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:51:11
You should look up what a blockchain is. I don't think you understand the concept. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:04:20
And if you use bitcoin as a store of value and never utilize any other aspect of the coin it is bad for the value of the coin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:14:00
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:13:10
You may refer to my other responses.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:19:31
You seem pretty stupid. Yes that is an ad hominem. Sue me. Not gonna continue this chess match with a pigeon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:31:56
No what I'm saying is: Restaurant's can not exist as places where people go to see what they should make for themselves at home and never actually eat there. Restaurant's need paying customers.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:36:44
Then why not buy gold.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:08:47
Sure. But a fiat is a store of value aswell once btc stops rising.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:30:58
There needs to be usage for the coin to stay valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:15:48
And what evidence do you have of that?
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:09:01
Ah, I see. Makes more sense now.
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:11:07
*inside of your foreskin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:16:21
How about they are both at fault.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:53:10
Lightning coming soon? It's out already.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:43:15
What is not a thing? Teens that don't remember the Great Recession or the Great Recession?
Anyways, both are a thing.
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:12:21
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:18:10
Of course they will. They'll launch one with a 10/90 chance if there is a deadline and the boss tells them it's time to launch.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:07:14
Pretty much, yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:14:08
That argument is so fucking stupid, it gave me a strowreinygawrjayherhlae
@_date: 2018-04-29 11:08:21
Seems to be a pretty discussed subject here, but I don't think it's generally 4 out of 5 yet.
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:21:18
It's clearly a joke, but the title IS click bait so I don't know what the fuck you're on about.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:06:29
Currently 4 out of 5 top posts in this sub are about bch. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:37:51
Yeah, I don't know if it's good that this sub is on par with r/trebutchetmemes...
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:54:40
Yeah, the two are not mutually exclusive. As for the rest of your post I have no idea what you're babbling about.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:52:20
Yes, 4 of the top 5 at the time of writing.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:39:02
I see no reason why 4-5G connections couldn't handle that amount of data?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:42:37
It doesn't matter if it uses a terabyte, if you have no datacap.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:43:43
They're not unlimited then.
