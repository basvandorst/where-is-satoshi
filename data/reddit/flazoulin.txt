You can't just keep on randomly updating through erratic Reddit comments or unannounced Q/A on IRC. Those don't have any value on a legal point of view and you KNOW it. 
More and more people are starting to think you try to stick to a "let it rot" strategy. You are promising things that are now happening to this day and only harm your **credibility** even more. 
Just to state a few: "All withdrawals will be gradually processed chronologically from another bank account" or "I try to publish a withdrawal page tomorrow".
What we want had already been said and it's clear:
1. Use the website as an unique communication channel or build a dedicated news blog.
2. Make an official statement backed by your lawyer and provide us with the name of the law firm that is working with you. Alternatively a publication in a trustworthy internet or paper media would be appreciable. 
3. Provide us with some official documents / communication regarding the freeze of your bank accounts. These shall disclose the concerned bank, amount and the estimated duration of the freeze as it is.
4. List the undertaken actions until now (when, what, with whom) to get 1) the bank accounts open again and 
2) the website running.
Keep in mind that the website has already been closed for more than 5 days without any verifiable statement coming our way. We want our money back and all we have been doing until now is **blindly** buying your excuses. This is clearly time this situation ceases.

Confirmed as a HOAX.

Even if this was to be confirmed, I assume his lawyer - if he exists - is on the case and should be handling this matter with the polish/german banks.

Agreed. It seems the kid has no idea where he's going and is developping and is hoping to get us weary.
