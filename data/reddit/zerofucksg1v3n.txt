This is why we need a maximum blocksize that adjusts upward with unbounded geometric growth at around 30% per year, so we can actually solve the blocksize scalability issue once and for all rather than arguing about it ad nauseum. This will keep us within storage and network limits as predicted by Moores and Neilsen's laws, forever. We could even skip up to like 16MB blocks right away and then implement that and we'd be just fine.

Iceland "recovered" by letting their banks nationalize the assets of foreign depositors. It will take decades before their banking sector or bond market recovers, and they have a population smaller than most midwest American cities. It's in no way a blueprint for recovery. Go to Iceland and try to get a bank account, you will fail. They have one of the most repressive banking and land management systems in the entire world, you basically have to be a landowner or have one co-sign for you to even get an account at a bank there, and you have to be a naturalized citizen who speaks Icelandic to become a landowner. Their main economies are literally based on fishing and sheeps wool, no-one will invest there because the entire country gets covered in ash every 50-100 years. If Germany started letting banks seize foreign assets, they would literally crash the entire EURO.

Cpu vanity-mining in an interpreted language is gonna be really slow. Try oclvanitygen for gpu mining. Vanity addresses should be carefully used, because even when imported into wallets, they are not part of the HR wallet structure so the funds in them is not recoverable by the 12-word wallet passphrase. Plus the fact that address re-use is discouraged, they are generally only used for online scavenger hunts and stuff like that.

Only problem is that it's basically impossible to buy land in Iceland unless you are already very wealthy or have 10 years to spare in their nationalization process. Iceland is actually really underbanked, you can't get a bank account there without being signed for by a land-owner, and they rely on foreign deposits to prop up their banking industry but for some funny reason their bond market is really shallow right now.

Apparently when they designed the Trezor, they didn't think to hook up an oscilloscope to the power feed and notice that it was obviously leaking digital data out through the input power source. Maybe a diode and capacitor in the right place in the schematic would have prevented this issue. Even the solution is hacky here, the device seems poorly designed if it leaks digital signatures of the internal electronics out on the power line, all they did was modify the code so it leaks *less* data, and admitted that it's still vulnerable to injection attack. So it appears the patch is only partially successfull and the Trezor is still vulnerable, actually. It really should have shipped with a ferric metal case also, to prevent EM emanations leakage.

Libertarians support capitalism, in general. Molyneux supports anarchism, which most people consider to be incompatible with capitalism. This community is held back by anarchists, and they are largely terrible representatives to the public. For example, at the Singapore conference last year, a prominent local anarchist talk-show host got up and started talking about how money laundering should be legal because all the things it is associated with should also be legal. Singapore is the human smuggling capital of the world, so that sentiment didn't go over so well.

You need to see it the other way around, and stop trusting people so much in this community. Is it a mandatory update to introduce a feature that I neither want nor need? Was the new source verified by an independent trusted 3rd-party? It's a device that is supposed to do one thing, and that is create bitcoin transaction signatures using a key that is securely held in the device and can only be accessed via predefined strict protocol. It should not need security updates. To me that indicates poor design and/or unwanted feature creep. I don't want the maintainance man dropping in on my Swiss bank account for "updates". Their site should always remain backwards compatible so that old firmware versions still work, is the correct answer. Updates that break backwards-compatibility are bad, and unverified vendor-forced firmware updates on supposedly secure hardware devices are very bad. Now even mytrezor.com is a moving target. Does that site run all it's code client-side only? How much data on my wallet and device does SatoshiLabs get via that interface?

Segwit turns all non-"upgraded" nodes into non-validating nodes. It's a hard-fork, not a soft-fork. It's an altcoin with a massive security vulnerability, made to turn bitcoin into a settlement network instead of a payment network or currency, because that is against the agenda of the big banks.

Segwit is a hard-fork, not a soft fork, and it will allow the core to change the number of bitcoins via a similarly enforced non-popular "soft-fork" at a later date. Ask what will happen to miners who don't pull in segwit PR, he told me they will no longer be mining "bitcoin", so this is clearly a hard fork. Spend-to-anyone transactions are clearly divergent from the original proposition of bitcoin, and they will cause money to be lost imho. On the point of counterparty risk in sidechains, why don't you explain to me how you think sidechains are possible *without* counterparty risk. You are taking money onto the sidechain held by Blockstream, with Lightning network. Open Transactions had a similar concept called "Voting Pools" years back but they pivoted before reaching their release. Now there is Tendermint, which allows sidechaining to any other chain. Blockstream took too long. Lightning network is no longer needed, and neither is segwit. They got eclipsed technologically because they were never the cutting-edge nerds to begin with. Now segwit just represents an attack on bitcoin, to me, because Blockstream needs it for their business model, and bitcoin not being able to scale blocksize is in the interest of the banking group R3.

Physical bitcoins: The least secure possible way to store bitcoin. I will not even go near physical bitcoins, I see them as a *huge* liability. They could turn out to be 'mal-spent' after any period of time, implicating entire groups of people as possible suspects in a theft, anyone who has ever been near the coin becomes a suspect. Someone sells you a physical bitcoin and then spends the funds out of it two weeks later and calls you a theif when you try to claim he didn't redeem it for you. Where is your proof that he is the thief and not you? No thanks. Physical bitcoins are for scammers. Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless, holding a physical bitcoin from someone else makes it back into a trust system.

Yes well they lost around 30x the amount of money that was on their books for the entire country, and that account technically became due. There was no way to ask the taxpayers to cover the debt, there are literally less than a million people who live in Iceland and they are sheepfarmers and fisherman.

What will happen is that a large fraction of users will refuse to accept "anyonecanspend" transactions, such as myself, and we will run nodes that specifically consider blocks with "anyonecanspend" tx as invalid blocks. Thus, hardfork. But I'm not that worried because I doubt Segwit will ever reach the 95% consensus. In fact Yihan Wu recently came out against it, publicly. It makes sense that miners would generally oppose a tool that aims to greatly and artificially reduce how much fees they can make on each block. I would support a sidechain implementation from a company that is not also employing core devs and creating an incentive for them to block on-chain scaling. I will never accept fundamental changes to the bitcoin architecture that are pushed by R3. The banks are attempting to attack bitcoin, this is how they will try to destroy it. In my mind, SegwitCoin is not, and never will be "bitcoin". It's "anyonecanspend" coin. R3 wants to rewrite the Satoshi whitepaper, they are literally insane people who cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2016-10-27 07:20:57
0% chance effectively, if you round to the nearest percent. ViaBTC is intentionally blocking Segwit and they have at least 7% of the mining hashrate, and there is no indication that the number of pools supporting segwit is going to go up, in fact indications are the opposite will happen. Segwit is not popular, and neither is the core, who are sellouts to the R3 banking group.

Segwit will absolutely cause a hardfork, because many, many people will not be upgrading their nodes to use it.
