Love this idea... I was actually thinking about this after Diablo 3 spectacular gold inflation and AH issues which led to them removing trading all together subsequently turning the game to shit in that regard.

What is wrong with anarchists? Assuming they mean anarcho capitalists, they are not too far removed from most libertarians..

Well it is Bitcoin so it's not only Australians who would use it, just like not only Japanese people used gox.

If you buy bitcoins to hold onto them, you are more or less investing in the success of the network and all vendors / consumers who use it. In that sense it could be compared to owning a share of the success of a technology and its implementation which in many cases would be close to how some stocks work.
On the other hand, you can trade bitcoins in a traditional forex sense, or use them simply as a currency, OR, do all of that at the same time.
Fact is, nothing like Bitcoin has existed before so it is difficult to pigeonhole it as any one thing.

C:\ ?
Poor choice in operating system for this application IMO

The part about regulation made me chuckle. I don't doubt they can put laws or choke points where Bitcoin meets the real world, but judging by how little politicians usually understand about technology, I expect their attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies will be interesting to say the least.

Either buy a dividend paying mining share of some type, or buy Bitcoins and hold them for a long time or until the next big spike (ie. 50 - 100%)

Sort of expected this to be a troll but site looks legit. All I can do is LOL

What's going on there? I have a final this Saturday and probably should be studying but thus interests me

Extremist? To be honest anarcho capitalist principals are far less extreme than the lack of government ones and the horrendous effects that lack of principals causes...

Not sure if trolling or just stupid...

The honey badger sure doesn't care though....

I suspect some sort of root kit.
You're using your primary operating system to do financial transactions.
That is your biggest mistake.

Most of you need to understand the bot operators are the serious traders. It is in mt gox best interest to keep them happy including improving the responsiveness and robustness of the trading interface. The majority of human traders do far less trades in far lower amounts. 
There is nothing stopping any of you coding your own bot and hft algorithm....

Lol. The point of btc is competitive currency. It already has the first mover advantage. Quit the nervousness and embrace the market forces.

I may be off here, but that valuation also assumes a nominal dollar value. In 5 years time who knows what a USD or the new reserve currency will be worth anyway. Would be interesting to see comparisons with hard resources. I haven't looked into this but would be an interesting statistic..

Pretty site. I like. 
Will my beta account transfer over to the real site?
Is there any documentation on the API at this point? 
(I checked the FAQ, which I thouroughly enjoyed I might add, but it didn't provide much info.) 
Props on your available 2 factor right out of the gate.
ps. I feel so rich with my fake balances....

I don't know how anyone who has been in the BFL pre order game for any more than 2 weeks wouldn't have bailed by now.
Obvious BFL failure is obvious.
@_date: 2013-06-19 00:49:10
Interested and have a spare 15k from BFL refund but no way am I preordering again especially at that price.
I'm sure the units will be in stock in two weeks? We can all order units outright then...
