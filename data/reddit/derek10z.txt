Ah last thing, when it says coordinator Fee : 0.003%  per anonymity set.. that means like if i go from anonymity 1 to 10 i have to pay 0.003% 10x times? or just once?

after i mix them, i plan to send all of them in one address isn't that ok? btw why i can't just break a piece and not use all?
@_date: 2019-03-04 23:39:38
let's say i mix 500$, and they put it in one address so after that if i need to buy something that cost 100$ i have to give them all 500$? and then what? they gona return the change and i have to remix the change?

Thanks you clear my mind by a bit. After obscuring the BTC with coinjoin I’m free to send the BTC to any wallet I want? Perhaps electrum?

And what he can do about that if he see me mixing them? If after mixing them i put them on another adress there is no way that they can come up to me right?

Let's say i get something i cannot get in my country, is there a way that wasabi grant that good mixing (better then other) to not being  tracked down like a rabbit?

Yeah i read about that so we are still far for it being completely anonymous
