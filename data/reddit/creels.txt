As long as they pay in BTC it looks like it's for everyone!

Mistake in the title: they're taking orders, not pre-orders. You can pay in BTC on their website ( or USD at the Kickstarter link in the title. 
First batch to ship July 30th! Happy printing!

Worked for me in Chrome today. The fgsfs disappears in Chrome as well.

Just want to jump in and say that this exact thing happened to me today. I put in a chargeback with AmEx three days ago, yesterday I received a credit e-mail and have refunds showing on my BFL account, and today I get two 'order shipped' emails. Has anyone received their order after this happened or are they using this as a way to prevent chargebacks?

Hey, they paid for expedited shipping for nothing. Works for me!

This makes me somewhat regret my recent USB miner purchase. 
Thanks!

As requested, 
Postman was very understanding about me rejecting the package after I explained the deal with BFL to him. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:19:40
Both tracking numbers are active now, so it looks like BFL jumped me in the order queue to prevent a chargeback. Maybe I got a box of rocks (I'll never know as I'm not signing for the package.) 
I'll let you know how long it takes the order to arrive.

This post helped me tremendously. I now have 918$ of cancelled orders in PayPal. Now it's time to call the credit card company to get them to do a chargeback.

One numb shows 9/14/2013 5:18 PM - Processed through USPS Sort Facility, KANSAS CITY, MO 64121
The second is still dead. I instructed my fiancé not to sign for any packages from MO.

I was referring to comments like that in my title. Sorry for not being specific enough! 
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:27:28
Did this work for you? We're you able to continue with the chargeback even if you declined the package?
@_date: 2013-09-15 16:14:15
When I spoke to the PayPal rep on the phone she told me that the disputes will come up as closed, but that I should continue to file a chargeback with my CC company. I filed the dispute and got an email from PayPal a few days after saying they were investigating. 
All I was told was that the rep added some notes to my account. Also, I believe that you can have the case reopened if you call their customer service number. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:43:20
If I'm the one that receives it, I definitely will. I'm sorry, but I can't promise my fiancé will do so.

A question for you, good sir: will the piper be open (root privileges, etc) for people that want to add features, use the Piper as a portable mini-printer, etc? 
I'm very interested in the project and purchased the 200$ version on Kickstarter, and having it more open would be fantastic. A small discount for redditors wouldn't be too bad, either. :-)

Alright, that's the last straw for me regarding MtGox. Can someone recommend an exchange that's secure (two factor preferred), has good customer support, and has a decent amount of options for deposit/withdrawal? 
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:16:44
I'm just not going to sign for the packages. I informed everyone in my house that they should kindly reject any USPS packages if they arrive from Kansas City, MO.

I'm semi-frightened by the fact that they claim to use 'SLL' encryption in one of the slides on the homepage. Frightened and safe. I think. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:25:09
Interesting idea. Do you have any more meetups scheduled so far? I'd suggest something on the weekend for us nine to fivers out there. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 00:00:44
Guess I'll be doing the same thing. I'm glad that this worked for someone. I was hung up on the fact that they might show that I refused to accept the package and refuse the refund. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:26:11
I'm hoping they ARE marking it as shipped to remove the order from their queue. Receiving the stuff I ordered would be pointless now.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:57:14
What effect will this have on miners? Will mining be 28% slower/less profitable? 
@_date: 2013-07-23 11:19:55
The TV show was alright. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 00:03:52
The tracking number I got is active now, so they did ship something out. I'm leaning towards the opinion that they are trying to prevent chargebacks by shipping the units once a claim is received. 
Good job, BFL. Ostracize the people who have ordered before me in order to prevent my rightfully getting my money back. Smooth. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 13:30:52
Thanks! I didn't realize the existed.
