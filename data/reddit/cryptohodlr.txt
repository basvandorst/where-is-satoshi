You guys also forgot about Stratis, with all upcoming smart contracts and ICOs. It is very undervalued right now! 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:16:23
so much shill, huh?

24 years just waiting for a chance... 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:15:05
the guy himself just commented and said he only accepts BTC, ffs!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:22:22
That something looking like a sandwich is called Stratis. It is very similar to Ethereum. It has been around since 2016. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:00:23
Also known for "crypto genius reveals next bitcoin..." lol
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:09:35
He wrote a sentence without using a period lol

I would recommend start using LN only for transactions of a couple hundreds or less, for a few months to a year, just to test out how safe it really is. This way we can discover and patch any bugs or flaws. For transactions of larger amounts, it is still safer and worth using the main blockchain.

Not Litecoin. Bitcoin won't allow for his little brother to die. LTC will have LN, and RS as well. Besides, LTC is basically a test-bed for BTC, so it will always be needed in the future to test upcoming upgrades for Bitcoin. Litecoin has never attempted to dethrone Bitcoin. It is simply supplementary to BTC. The rest of Alts will be in danger for sure.

Your Electrum wallet files (i.e wallet.dat) is not encrypted in default, unless you manually encrypt the wallet (which will then display a lock on the bottom right). I would NOT recommend uploading your wallet.dat or any backup files on the cloud, UNLESS it is encrypted with a strong password. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:44:03
To be fair, he also mentioned he had the seeds for his wallet on a txt file, but on the thumb drive. He should have written the seeds on a piece of paper (or engraved them on a piece of metal) and hid it in a different location.

Here's driving "on" a chart! lol

Don't forget Bitcoin God, should be available next year lol

three fiddy
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:50:29
I can see LTC remain as a valuable coin (will keep going up in value), even with BTC's Lightning. Also, Vertcoin will appreciate big time thanks to its ASIC-resistance and decentralization properties. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:52
all great points!
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:49:20
Yes, but he does not have the 12 word phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:23
yes, "us", as in Bitcoin community. Are you not a fan of him for some reason?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:54
there is no problem at all!
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:53:20
Bcash bcrashing soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:09:26
what if you go to a store or a restaurant/diner? You simply cannot use your card if you don't have it on you, remembering the numbers won't help. You will need to swipe/insert the actual card.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:35:05
You are actually right. Fiat owns Ferrari.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:36:09
If i do this, i will make sure that the exchange is built to be very convenient for the customers. Will also have to implement KYC and AML to make it 100% legal and transparent. I don't have the developers yet. US based at the moment.

i'm for this one!
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:45:02
Hello Tai Lopez! How have you been?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:32:10
solid advice!
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:41
and it is also worth mentioning, that this is the total amount of BTC, every single person in that country will own in their LIFETIME.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:39:02
that total of 57 BTC dates back to 2013-05-09. In the recent 2 hours, his available balance went up $20k. He deserves it and much more tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:11
This guy gets it!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:07:27
i don't think he was being serious. I got the vibes that he was saying that Bitcoin is skyrocketting, that a thousand dollar increase will mean nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:20
By the time you get there, it will already be $17K in US and $20K in Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:23:04
The funny part is that Fiat owns Lamborghini LMAO
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:09:57

i was hoping to get a real car with my Bitcoin, not a Radio Controlled one. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:59:08
Andreas, now keep that money safe! wtf, i forgot for a second that he is a security expert as well. Seriously, he deserves much more than that.
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:48:04
Because South Morocco (called Western Sahara) is a disputed territory of Morocco.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:59:02
Andreas is the true Bitcoin Messiah. You simply cannot get a better person to represent us. We all love you.   
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:30:20
LTC's got his bigger brother's back for now, till BTC gets Lightning ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:30:00
bingo! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:27:09
His boss has already fired him. He already told him he was robbed. What else can he explain to him? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:39:39
That's good then! The more security measures, the safer your funds are. Just make sure you don't forget your password/passphrase.

@_date: 2017-11-20 20:06:29
true that! lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:18:56
bro, this is the best man to represent Bitcoin, can't get any better! Screw Roger and the other hypocrites! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:08:30
i thought i was the only one that couldn't understand what the hell he was talking about lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:42:40
can you imagine if you made a typo, and put 2200 instead of 2020...you will be long gone before you can redeem those BTCs lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:40:38
Bitcoin community should really appreciate Charlie, i know i do. He is pushing for BTC and LTC big time! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:09:23
fast editing job lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:25:55
lol, i'm not a bot. I just noticed that these bots are posting the same shit on every thread
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:35:15
Glad i could i help. 
We couldn't have asked for a better person to represent us Bitcoin community! Andreas is the man!

Please stop giving them free SEO juice. Refer to them as Bitcoin(dot)com.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:21:29
man there is a lots of spam going on here, especially from these people/bots: crypto12491t, crypto33y46w (basically most ones that start with "crypto"), and bitmady75354 (and 
each one that starts with "bitmad"). We gotta do something about this. They are spamming every single thread in r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:41:37
who really needs pussy when they have Bitcoins. Bitcoin will buy you everything, including pussy!

No buddy, you are a trillionaire!! lol
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:45:28
lmfao! It's the angle broski!
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:01:09
i second this! If you don't have expensive ASIC miners, you won't be able to profit from mining Bitcoins. Vertcoin (VTC) is minable with regular GPUs and CPUs, and is like Litecoin, and will likely be worth just as much in a couple years from now.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:17:14
Any idea how i can invest in LND? Or am i better off investing in BTC itself?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:52:21
Also, if you look at the "S" which looks kinda similar to USD symbol, it is pointing downward...down the toilet! lol

Just use Bitcoin Pizza (BPA), and be done with it! LMFAO
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:47:55
You might have misunderstood my comment. What i meant is Vertcoin has the potential to be worth as much as current Litecoin price in a couple years. Not that it will be worth as much as Bitcoin. Also, Litecoin is very likely to worth much more what is worth today in a few years from now. Bottom line, Vertcoin is very undervalued right now, as well as Litecoin...and even Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:23:32
it was due to bad practices related to mortgages and auto insurance
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:38:29
I have about 6750 NMC which is worth over $14k. Thank God i moved 390 LTCs out of there about a week ago.
