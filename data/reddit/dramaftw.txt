I guess not buying at all and getting a beautiful daughter is better than buying and selling early. Thanks.

I dont know but when I was investigating it I was looking at its history and its long terms potential for me. Saw its rise from less than pennies to the price it was at. I dont feel like I would have jumped at 50 and felt like the pizza guy(as you see, regret is big for me). I probably would have jumped @ over 5k (then regretted when it tripled in just a few more months) but even then all these small life changes would have been covered by that even. Talk to my wife and ask her of my patience and see what she says. But who knows for sure, either way it doesnt really help my mindset at the moment.

What is it?

I was afraid of this, No this was not the intention but not quite sure how else to word it. I appreciate the insight but it all fits into the who knows, what if's and everything else that dreams are made of. Just looking for more insights to make me feel not crap about missing what feels like the only chance.  Thanks for your insight, It seems to be the feeling that almost  no one would have held past 50-100 mark.
