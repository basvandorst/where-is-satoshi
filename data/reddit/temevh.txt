Already did and she said that yes if i feel like its a good investment
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:21
And that obviously is the best time to buy it
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:06:44
And here i am scared to buy some with 50 euros :D

Just started to worry a bit. Im new to bitcoin so i dont really know how it goes. But good for you if you are older and wiser than me :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:12
why so?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:57:26
Well thats painfully close to the amount that i have :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:01:11
Well not really 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:11
Does correction mean that the value will drop a lot?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:13
Maybe people want others to see the thread so they wouldnt need to ask the same questions? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:42:31
Should i buy after the correction then?

I am ready to lose that money, i have never counted it when i count how much money i have, its kinda like the money you find from between car seats
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:31:18
Im actually kinda proud of myself, not many people that are my age use money on investing or saving money. They usually buy alcohol or something like that
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:40:25
I was thinking of starting with 50€, and every month i would add 10€ to the balance
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:53:39
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:53:16
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:20:27
Well i wouldnt really mind. The off grid money jar is the black sheep of my wealth, i have never counted it when i have counted how much money i have so it would really change anything if i lost it
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:07:47
I can lose it but of Course i dont want to
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:13:55
I wonder how many bitcoins it would take to buy ajit pai
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:21:37
Yeah i just tested it, daily profit was around 1€ so not very effective :D

I will try the breadwallet. When i mine coins from my pc how do i transfer them to my breadwallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:28:36
Can i somehow count my hashing power? I have a gtx 1060 3gb and didnt find anything from a quick google searh
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:37:07
If i use nicehash to mine the coins, do i put my breadwallet or nicehash address into the program or does it matter?
