Hey, thanks for posting! I got a refund of a bet that I won just in the past couple of days and was looking around for why I got the bitcoin back. Yay for no exit scam! (although I didn't get back what I would have won, at least got the original back plus just a little)

Your guys' conversation just brims with arrogance. It's not a mob, it's a concept called "users". They don't need re-education, they want the service to work. If your answer to that is LN, then prove it, but meanwhile keep bitcoin working for, yes, even users with $0.02 tx fee who you may view as unworthy.
And claiming science is on your side is lame. The two camps just have different priorities.

Great post, hadn't seen this.
I love the way she handled this, and the way his counter-arguments really don't have substance. "But I want the real stuff, gold and silver" he says. He doesn't realize the reason he says that is because he's internalized the trust of many other people for gold and silver, and he knows that there is a fixed quantity of it. When he realizes that bitcoin offers that same proposition he might convert.

That's the part of the overreach that seems purely protectionist, because surely most international providers won't do this (i.e. won't serve NY residents). So guess who is left to provide an exchange for them, those based in New York! It's no wonder the NY exchanges are in favor of this.

It goes to 50 minutes about once every few days, last time I looked.
That's why this "10 minute" number is a bit silly to quote. Either you design for a confirmation and the customer to wait an hour, or you rely on an unconfirmed transaction for retail.
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:55:04
That's a nice way to do it. Then peers have an incentive to keep their clock synchronized to minimize their reconciliation work.
moleccc, I like your idea. It's also super efficient because when I'm in your "removal" phase (because I can't find a count=1 or -1) I don't even have to start over--I think I can just keep pulling out of C what I can, and when I get stuck I remove one of these probably "extra" tx and check just those buckets where it changed the count, to see if it resulting in a successful "peel". I bet this intelligent decode can be made real fast.

@_date: 2014-08-09 04:26:16
And I think also it isn't time sensitive, so you can just not include the most recent transactions and wait N seconds to work on building up this new block. The miners would choose N large enough so that everything is ready to go and the build time would never be in the critical path to cause an orphan block.
I'm not saying this so well, but what I mean is that increasing the transactions per block is the big deal that is fixed here. If some late transactions slip from one block to the next because they were too recent to be Merkeld, that's an okay price to pay.
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:30:33
yep. that's why short sellers in any commodity really aren't a threat (other than causing some volatility). they buy back in at some point so the overall effect is neutral.

I think it's a good idea, used carefully (not as a replacement for normal tip, but as something unexpected). The wording is too hard a sell though for my taste, it does sound almost religious.
How about something a lot more low key? Just tease them with it, "Thank you for the great service, I really appreciated it! Here's $10 in bitcoin!" Let them figure out the whole wallet etc. stuff, they will give it to their tech nephew or something.
Is the idea then that we trust you not to pilpher the wallets at some low rate? Ah, wait, I see you use client-side java from bitaddress.org. Okay.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:02:11
Gavin, one more note on your comment:


I think your argument is that the tx contents can serve as a checksum of sorts for the decode phase, since it is redundant with the key in the same way the paper's "key_checksum" is. But this is incompatible with your chunking scheme (especially at 8B, but even for 64B data chunks), as I understand it.
e.g. when you are decoding, you hit a count=1 or count=-1 cell, so it's a candidate to be peeled. In the full IBLT you would check the checksum at that point vs. your key and know for sure if it could be peeled or if it's an alias. In your proposed scheme where you optimize away the checksum, you would need to check the key against the transaction id in the transaction content. But that might not (probably won't) be in the data for that particular chunk.
You need to know right then if you can peel that chunk based on only that chunk's data, you can't wait until the entire tx has been assembled from all chunks because by then you would have (probably wrongly) peeled many more chunks and the whole IBLT will be screwed up pretty bad.
Quite possible I'm missing something clever you have in mind, though!
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:32:31
Read Gavin's proposal. It directly addresses # of transactions/block and fees. (It does without having to increase block size)

With the price dropping $10(?) a day, I think absorbs the 3600 btc/day based on order book depth (in other words, nobody is net buying any coins at the current price). It will stabilize, like you say. Under 100 would be cool, I could buy more.

It's curious to me that he understands the idea of the power of a brand so well, yet he discounts bitcoin's brand. Brands have the most power when there is the least differentiation in features, like his beloved sugar water, i.e. in commodities. Bitcoin is the ultimate commodity in that in terms of feature set you can clone it exactly (litecoin, etc). Once established, there will be no unseating it as long as it can grow, as did Ethernet or other widespread standards, to keep up with alternatives.

thanks for the link. interesting to me for the implied math:
using this 500GH at $500 for 500W number, it says if you built today's hash fleet out of this device it would cost out at $100M. Since the block reward for the year (at today's price) is about $700M and assuming mining is about net zero profit, and including a small adder for power (about $1.50 for each $12/day I figure) that means each miner has to replace hardware effectively about every 2 months. Or that most of the value of a device is extracted in 2 months, in any case (even if they don't actually replace it). Makes rough sense, since the hash rate is doubling every month or so. Brutal industry.

I'm pretty tech savvy and if I had the option of just clicking "buy" in my schwab account, AND if the COIN tracks the real bitcoin enough, I would just do that to avoid all the hassle of wire transfers and private keys and stuff. A no brainer. So I'm thinking this will pick up a lot of even tech people.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:34:49
That's my feeling--yes it can do some corner case things. But we haven't even shown that a basic contract in Bitcoin is useful yet, in real application. There's plenty of time to extend Bitcoin with some duct tape to cover the majority of use cases ok. End consumer won't really care if it's not as elegant under the hood.
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:09:48
My understanding what saves us from this in the US is that bitcoin is an intangible. Or is it that it is barter.
That doesn't work in AUS, evidently.
Does this mean you can still wire money out of the country to Hong Kong or whatever and buy bitcoin and not get hit with the sales tax?
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:35:30
This is exactly the issue discussed in the second paper Gavin's proposal references, the one about subtracting IBLTs. The case you give is very likely to happen in a case in which you subtract tx from the IBLT that never were added (which is what Gavin is proposing with the wholesale IBLT subtract op resulting in diff_IBLT). The case is that the count=1 is not from a single tx you've added, but from 2 you've added and one you've subtracted, or 3 you've added 2 you've subtracted, or ...
So there's this extra checksum field you need to protect against that. You can make sure what you think is the key matches the checksum field. You make that large enough (I don't know how large is good enough) so that you can ignore this possibility. Like 16B for 2^128 power maybe.

The IBLT stuff doesn't even require a hard fork, maybe? Depending on all the corner cases, I think one could roll it out incrementally as an optional advertisement, because it would be in miner's interest to support it.

I'd love to see the graph showing total coins on Y axis, so it grows, versus same time on X axis, and bands for periods of time (quarters maybe) when the coin last moved. then the unmoved coins would show consistency as a horizontal bar at the bottom. just an idea.

Assuming they succeed with an ASIC-resistant algorithm, an ASIC costs $500 and burns 100W. A computer costs $500 and burns 500W. For a given $ amount invested by miners in perfect competition for either coin (say for equivalent block reward $, for sake of argument), it seems the portion "wasted" on electricity is higher for general purpose CPU. Right? It just depends if it's "wasted" on ASIC developers (salaries, fab etc) vs. "wasted" on electricity.

Your questions get asked a lot so you won't get a lot of answers. Just go do some reading.
Alts sound like a showstopper when you first learn about bitcoin, then you realize they've already been around a while, it's not a new thing somebody could try someday, and that bitcoin already won. It's already been battle tested. Then you start realizing, damn, bitcoin is one hell of an idea.

The NYDFS is protectionist legislation, so companies that are based in NY and accepting the cost are happy to have non-NY companies excluded from their entire NY market. They suddenly don't have to compete with bitstamp, for example (assuming bitstamp doesn't get a bitlicense--I can't see them doing it, the peculiar USD and reporting requirements). Fortunately, there seem to be a number of NY based companies starting, so there should be competition among them.

Satoshi was very clever--the bitcoin mining is just like real gold mining in that the return is elastic. So the miners will always increase costs to mine more marginal return up to the market price (or their guess of some future market price).
So for real gold, it's not a coincidence $1200 is the mining cost. Same for bitcoin--it's not coincidence that $570 or whatever is the cost.
What I think is fascinating is how the mining cost (for both gold and bitcoin), which is driven by the market price, then turns around and becomes a loose psychological floor for the market price. Markets in free fall look for a gathering point in which to provide resistance--this "actual mining cost" provides that gathering point. It's why gold stopped it's free fall at $1200 I think.
So mining is like a big flywheel to the system. It takes time to spin up, but once it gets going, it convinces everybody that the produce (gold or bitcoin) actually has that value. This feedback loop is genius. Or I should say recognizing that this feedback loop can be lifted from gold and applied to a digital currency was genius, and why I became a convert.

Right. Taxes suck but they are logical, so don't freak. Getting paid in bitcoin will look like getting a stock grant which is commonplace. Income tax first, then that establishes your basis, then short or long-term capital gains (or losses) on that gain from the basis, then sales tax when you spend it.

Think of it as a control plane thing rather than data plane. All the tx get hashed down to a single chunk of data, that is the same size no matter how many transactions are in the block. That is then used by the ASICs to find a solution. More tx doesn't mean more mining work by the data plane, just the controller who updates the header every now and then. (And like molecc says, that can be delayed--today delayed as much as you want--in Gavin's scheme delayed only as much as won't screw up the IBLT decode by getting too out of sync with what peers are expecting)

Of the 13.6M BTC out there now, many (most?) are being held by people who are unresponsive to market conditions. They are either lost coins or held by people that have no intention of selling in the current price range. All of those coins from the inflation sources you mention are generally seeking buyers. The fact that we've been pulled steadily lower all year from 700ish to 300ish with our fingers digging in the whole way to me means the demand has been just short of the daily miners production.  I think the USMS auctions provided the impulse function to kick it lower by $300 and just stick it there, and we'll be stuck there until that clears. Let's get those two auctions on and over with.

If you flip a big enough amount right away, the capital gains are taxed at short-term rate 39.6%, plus Obama's 3.8% healthcare tax (applies to capital gains since 2013 which sucks), then state tax is anywhere from 0 to 13% (CA). So that's where I get my 43-52% from. it's actually 56% worst case if you've phased out your itemized deductions (the state tax). Not sure why this is controversial. I think people here are thinking of 20% long-term rate, but my whole point was about the high overall tax rate when flipping quickly.

I'm trying to put my thoughts together for what to bid as part of secondmarket's syndicate tomorrow, and this is a useful post. However, OP's analysis is too cerebral I think--it's like a PhD analysis of how to pick up women. You can theorize all you want why people should behave a certain way but I just don't think they will. At least as a smaller buyer no way I would. The result will depend on how much it ends up a sum of small buyers vs. (in the extreme case) one buyer who wants to buy them all and *might* pay a premium for that particular case, I agree.
The thing about this auction is that it's quirky--the timeline is fast, it's hard to get your capital together and wire transfer story straight in just the few days. The direct USMS auction for full lots is limited to US residents maybe? Anyway, it's not a fluid market. The number of people that can bid for a full lot is small, and number of people willing to jump into secondmarket's syndicate at the drop of a hat is small. I don't know of other syndicates due to trust issues and the fast timeline.
So I was initially thinking $300 or something and just hoping not that many people can get their shit together and I'd get lucky. But yeah I suppose that's too optimistic. $450 maybe?
(btw, I'm already long bitcoin, so I'll be happy if OP is right!)

I've given this advice a few times which I think is awesome, but it's not really been picked up by the reddit faithful, ha ha. I think because most of them are super technical and root discs and unbuntu installers and stuff are no problem.
- if you are not super technical, and
- if you have enough bitcoin to really want this to be a dedicated machine
then buy a new chromebook. it's $150 and factory clean. everything is in chrome browser, don't download any extensions. download bitaddress.org, disable wifi, generate addresses. you can cloud print if you want, but I rather like to take pics of the screen for backup instead.

The vulnerability of the race attack is in a window on the order of the round trip time of the network, i.e. a few seconds. It's not got to do with the block time (which btw can go to 50 minutes a few times a day with its poisson distribution, so definitely you don't want to wait for a confirmation in retail).

Looks believable to me. Read it from the point of view of gox board of directors trying to shop out an investment from the bitcoin ecosystem (the other exchanges, wealthy investors, etc). They are pleading the case that if they don't help gox, bitcoin itself will go down. There's a little humility there, and some threat too.
When I was looking at the math, I realized that an exchange that started to "remove the ring fence" between operational and customer funds could get all the way to zero reserve and still operate without much delay in processing customer fiat or BTC withdrawals. As long as money keeps rolling in, which it was.
But Gox got so deep in, they weren't just at zero reserve, they sucked all the money from people for the next 30 days as well, so that queue formed for withdrawals. So I was pretty convinced they were insolvent. But I didn't expect the backlash on stamp pricing so much.

Good thing is, we have time. Bitcoin is for the long term. The only argument I see against this architecture, besides transition pain, is the camp of people saying Bitcoin shouldn't grow in capability because it knocks out the hobbyist. That argument doesn't seem likely to win. I don't see a technical reason why this won't be a go deal. If testing shows that it's actually hard to synchronize the data sets within the IBLT threshold, then I'm sure a lot more hints can be added one way or another to help get that closer.

I bet there are examples of this in the fine art world. Somebody overpays for a scribble by a lot (not a billion dollars, but maybe a million bucks). Then the value is seen to be a lot less than that particular price, after other people in the market comment it. Then over time, more investors see that the price wasn't so high after all, and pretty soon you've got a market established for Mr. Scribble artist. At some point, it becomes a value if the market is reasonably stable.

That was sort of my train of thought in my OP that you could send a really compressed Bloom filter first. Yours is one better because then you could at least see what tx you were missing. In mine you would only know you were missing something, or N things, but not know what! (which probably isn't helpful because you'll always be missing something I bet)
Once I grokked the IBLT scheme though, I became a convert to Gavin's scheme to just solving it in one shot rather than multiple messages to fetch tx contents later.

@_date: 2014-08-11 16:59:51


There's one more complication which gets into the really nitty gritty.
There are two sorts of IBLTs: one type in which you delete from them only items you know have been added, and one type in which you can delete things which were possibly never added (leaving some negative counts and these weird alias cases for which this extra checksum is required). The first type is simpler, and may be what you are thinking of when you listed your 1,2,3 steps above. The second type is what Gavin must be proposing because he refers to the use of the IBLT wholesale subtraction op.
So using my example of 1M tx in a newblock message, and you the receiver have your own best guess list of about 1M tx you think are in this set, it's actually hard to see what of your transactions are in that set. Again, using my arbitrary example numbers, if there are 10k cells in the IBLT, holding 1M tx that are hashed 3 times each, that means the "count" field is about 300 in *each cell*! None of them will be close to zero or one. This IBLT is really packed with information, so dense that somebody who didn't know most of what was in it would have no chance of decoding it. So if you used your 1,2,3 algorithm literally you could never hit your case 3.
Instead what you do as the receiver is build up your own IBLT with your 1M best guess tx. This will also have about count=300 in each cell. Then you go cell-by-cell and do the subtraction (or XOR, equivalently, I think there is no difference as long as only one entry has been added per key). *Then* assuming the total number of differences is 1500 (either way--either tx I didn't have, or tx I mistakenly thought were in the solved block--and I can't tell up front) you get this nice diff_IBLT that has enough count=1 *or* count=-1 cells that let you peel it all off and recover all the tx.
My main point is that until you do this wholesale subtraction, you don't know if any particular transaction is part of the set or not.

Hi Bruce, maybe you can shed some light on my top concern with bitcoin. I have a large investment and this is blocking my buying more.
We have a race condition for getting US citizen USD exchanged to bitcoin:
1. Probable trouble with FATCA compliance for Bitstamp in Slovenia and 30% withholding on wire transfers (affecting Coinbase as well)
2. Kraken and (hopefully many) other US-based exchanges fighting regulatory red tape to get going at volume (or at all).
If 1 happens before 2, then the USD-to-bitcoin path takes a big hit (similar to China yuan not able to get into bitcoin). July 1, 2014 is supposed to be the deadline for the withholding penalty for non-compliant FFI, although I've seen the insurance companies lobbying for another extension to Jan 1, 2015. 
There are two ways Bitstamp could be FATCA compliant: an IGA between Slovenia and US, I doubt could be signed by July 1 but I don't have any actual info on it, or Bitstamp themselves could contract with the IRS (not likely--I've asked Bitstamp and they did not say they had any plans for this, although even if they did they probably wouldn't tell me).
Note: some people on this forum and bitcointalk may be surprised to find (as beany baby founder just found for his $100M he thought the IRS didn't know about in Switzerland) that either ways in this "compliant" scenario, the IRS would know about their bitstamp accounts even if they don't file an 8938 or FBAR. Either that, or they are non-compliant and we can't wire transfer over to them anymore from the US. Both outcomes sound bad. I favor the regulatory path as less bad, based on my personal needs (investment), but I completely understand those who don't want the reporting and would prefer the no wire transfer outcome as less bad. But then BTC price would take a hit, and I don't know how big funds would come in then other than private buys.
Any perspective appreciated, thanks!

His methodology seems reasonable, with only nits. It's nice work.
What is controversial is the argument that mining cost matters to price, or that new mining hardware causes the price to decline. I think the more conventional wisdom is that mining cost (gradually) follows price. I agree with him it's net zero-profit over time.
Just like for gold though, it provides a psychological floor for both miners and holders. A gathering point to mount resistance in a dropping market, like gold at $1300. Mining cost then serves as some kind of one-way ratchet that keeps bitcoin stable.

I'm super long bitcoin, but I don't think it's obvious the graphs will repeat in another July-Sept boom/correction as many people do. $1k needs $1B/year to be put into bitcoin (either by new investment or miners holding).
However, US mutual funds are something like $15T with 1-2T/year going in. It's very interesting dynamic system with exponentially growing adoption but also capital requirements to keep supporting this (short-term) printing of new bitcoin we've got scheduled.

Thanks Gavin, you hit my questions! 
What about the ragged edge of recent transactions in the last 30-40 seconds that haven't propagated completely? If you agree with my intuition that these might account for the bulk of the tx set differences, how about a mechanism for more cleanly synchronizing that ragged edge by timestamp or a kind of "end framing hint" of a few tx that would help the receiver know about where to stop their guess of what tx are in the solved block.
I'm thinking this would also take pressure off the miner for having to fast compute their IBLT with all the up-to-date transactions. Instead they would just stick a stake in the ground every 30 seconds, say, marking the end of their IBLT, and know that the receivers wouldn't even attempt to guess tx younger than that via this hint.
It may not be necessary now, but thinking ahead to when we might have a million transactions in a block and don't want to get a ragged edge of a few thousand tx per second clogging up the IBLT decode.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:14:09
He's talking about 0-conf delays. I agree with his point. but it will get better. If not in the core bitcoin network, the bitpays of the world will take on some risks to deliver that product (instant purchase).

If it's $50 in the lead up and through the next halving in May 2016 or whatever, then I'd be surprised. But could hit that in the low before then. Too many coins issued every day. It's like OPEC just pumping.
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:12:25
I think it's sort of like, why not send the data also in one shot with the IBLT since it can do it so efficiently? (Rather than make extra catchup work to go get the tx that you are missing.)
But it's a fair question. I think it depends on the variance of the amount of difference in the tx sets. If the variance is low, like almost all the time each peer has something near N tx that are different, then an IBLT of size 1.5*N is a good solution because you are sending what people need anyway, you're just shooting it to them with a "push" rather than make then get it later with a "pull".
If the variance is high, where some peers really get it exactly right and others need a whole ton of extra tx, that might argue for a scheme like you are saying. Just communicate what is out of sync and let each peer go request what they are missing.

You guys are missing the whole point about this proposal. It doesn't use increased block size to handle more transactions. It sidesteps putting all transactions in the new block message entirely.

@_date: 2014-03-04 17:01:30
there is a lot of fud on this. I got to go read the source code. I think even in the halved reward case, the miner won't want to risk creating an orphan and therefore not getting the block reward by putting in a lot of shady transactions (that most other nodes have rejected because it was clearly sent later) just to get a little extra fee. Unless the miners collude on this to collectively squeeze a little extra out from fraud (but doesn't seem worth it to me for the disruption to the system they themselves are part of)
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:37:45
You're not going to pay any tax since you won't have any gains. The question is, do you (theoretically, I understand) want to try to take the capital loss to offset other gains. I think it's an investment that went worthless and you can declare it, although it will invite audit risk so it will be a hassle. Depending what tax bracket you are in it may be worth it. 50% bracket like in the big US blue states would mean it's a decision worth, well, depends on your basis, but maybe $12k if you bought in recently.

Superintendent Lawsky, how about introducing two levels of compliance with your regulations.
Clearly there is a goal of certifying the top players like SecondMarket's Bitcoin spin-off with a rigorous international seal of approval that will give large institutions confidence in dealing with them. It's a high bar, but once met it is a valuable certification. Let's call that level 2.
There is also the need for a level 1 compliance, which would be some much reduced set of your regulations, for instance requiring all of the customer disclosure section. To have New York citizens as customers, a business would have to be only level 1 compliant. Perhaps even to a certain revenue threshold.
This would preserve freedom of choice for your citizens of New York, plus give you the recognition your office desires for internationally regulating Bitcoin.

The reason I ask is that I was running scenarios back in my head, if I had sold at $1200 peak from buying at $500, would it have made sense. in that case, it would have been short term capital gains, so turns out it really wouldn't have paid to sell even if I'd timed it right. hodl just seems better due to your friendly US gubmint.

As a thought experiment, if you could buy enough of today's chip that does 500GH/s at $500 and 500W, then you can get to the current 112M GH/s with 220,000 chips, that's $110M USD. But it's a moving target, that would get you an advantage only temporarily.
Another way to say it: a chip produces most of its income in 2 months with doubling of hash rate about monthly. So a miner has to buy about 6 of these a year. That works out to about $1B invested per year, which is about the mining reward, which makes general sense because mining is profit-neutral.
So if you wanted to *stay* ahead you have to invest $1B per year.
Electricity doesn't cost that much for these new chips compared to capital cost, surprisingly. (at least when they are new)

See the other thread about SecondMarket acting as a bid aggregator. So you could put in a bid for a lot less than a whole lot and still participate.

Dell coming on board is another solid brick in the whole story. The fact that they spin it as "so easy to do in 2 weeks" to me is better news than Dell taking bitcoin itself. That means this revolution is happening. Low friction.
I think we've solidified around the price that seems to be people's best guess at the USMS auction. Someone pays $20M, people assume he is smart, so the buyers will support this $620 price. Now after the auction, $580 for example would be seen as a good deal. That keeps things from dropping very far.
On the high side, there is a hesitation, people waiting to buy until others start as evident in the excellent chart 
Dell just builds up pressure in the machine that will possibly erupt in some N weeks now, maybe if more of the situation clears around the BitLicense.

You might be asking a different question that is being answered: how long would it take to recreate the whole current blockchain with today's hash rate, and that is on the order of a month. meaning, if you had the entire network under your control, you could go back to the first blocks, give yourself a huge chunk of bitcoin, and recalculate the hashes, and you'd catch up to almost where we are now fairly quickly. theoretical, though, there are checkpoint hashes.

SM made 9 (or 10?) bids, not just one. I got their whole agreement paperwork and read it carefully. They sorted the price from high to low, cut it into 3000-btc chunks, took the mean of each one. (ignoring the odd lot complication)
So I'm guessing but their bids were probably from 550 (current market price last Wednesday for the wire transfer) down to your price and below. I take that as pretty good evidence that the winning bid was over market (against my own speculation!)

The 200k DPR coins too factor in. Also just knowledge about the upcoming auction factors in too--nobody wants to call bottom yet (at least I don't) because all of that is looming, plus another year to get through at 3600 BTC/day. As shown by the Gox bots, restricting the supply of new BTC by about half caused the price to shoot up dramatically, as said also by another poster here--the price is determined on the margin. Look at oil. A measly +3m bpd more from the US on a base worldwide production of something like 90m bpd and the price tanks 2x. It's all about the margin!

Bitcoin is often compared to the Internet. This regulation is protectionist, and is analogous to saying "because email is so dangerous, residents of New York must only use certified email providers that have a deep relationship with New York--i.e. probably are the ones based in New York".
It's a sad day for the freedom of the people of New York state. Many international Bitcoin services will be denied to them.
I have to be one of the more pro-regulation people on this forum, and I am shocked at the over-reach attempted here. It's like FATCA for banks telling the world they have to report in to a power in the US, except 1) it comes from a single state and not the US, 2) it seems to apply to all kinds of bitcoin businesses (proofofexistence, other utility services?) even ones that don't hold any bitcoin for you or exchange.

There's some price risk but it's a crap shoot. They could do it in chunks over different days to average the ups and downs.
Bitcoin doesn't have a place. It just exists. The place is associated with going in and out of bitcoin, namely the bank.
Since they have to transfer the money to an exchange, like say bitstamp, they would wire the money there. Then buy bitcoin. Then sell bitcoin and wire the money where they want it. But maybe you noticed--what's the point of bitcoin then? And the answer is, if you are just sending money to yourself, directly wiring it will be easier since you'll need a bank in both places anyway to send and catch the wires to and from the exchanges.
But there are a ton of variations to this. Suppose you can't wire out of or into some country X. Then you can get into bitcoin any way you can, then go to some other exchange acceptable to where you want the money to end up, convince that exchange via KYC AML that you aren't a criminal, and get your money out.
Good luck, and report back!
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:13:26
Yep. 1500 was my pencil estimate based on a 1MB newblock message. It scales linearly (that 1.5d thing) so if you did a 10MB message you could send along 15k transactions that a receiver didn't know about. It's pretty magic--each receiver in fact could have a different 15k transactions out of the 1M that they didn't know about, and it would *still work*! They each pluck out of the compacted ITLB only the ones they don't know about. (Also keep in mind they also burn into that 1500 or 15k number with any tx that they guess wrong the other way--things they thought were in the solved block but actually aren't.)
@_date: 2014-06-29 04:13:48
Interesting, but isn't it just saying "if I make winning the auction my goal, I must bid high"? I think it's a spherical cow kind of thing where real world details will determine the result, not theory.
In this case, bidders of smaller amounts through second market as we've already seen from Barry's tweet, will be below market price, it is fair to assume. They are smaller buyers and wouldn't pay the 5% premium (vs. secondmarket's 2% premium for trading desk, or direct to an exchange, for instance).
And as has been argued so passionately in this reddit, for those bidders who want big blocks of 5K, 10K, or even all 30K coins, they might be willing to overbid.
What we don't know is how many of those second type there are.
I don't think you can model this situation without better characterization of the different actors.

Interesting. In networking at the packet level that's called cut-through routing vs store-and-forward. That would have a number of corner cases to code too I'd imagine (you start to relay, then fail to finish).
Given an IBLT library, Gavin's approach shouldn't require that much app code, I'd think. You just walk over your tx list and either form or decode these IBLT. And it seems like it would be isolated to the piece of code handling the newblock message. It also saves half the network bandwidth, vs the asynchronous forwarding which still resends all tx.
Edit: 2x -&gt; half

There's a huge chasm between clicking "buy" with etrade or schwab, and wiring money through foreign exchanges and handling private keys. The average person with money is scared shitless of ubuntu cdroms and VM hacks and multi-sig whatevers, especially if they poke their head in here and read a few "I've been hacked" posts. I have no trouble at all believing people will jump on this big time, happy to pay a few percent.
Also being able to divert IRA/401k money is huge. Hard to pull that out to wire money to an exchange otherwise.
Your point about if they can't handle private keys why would they believe in bitcoin in the first point is a really good one and gets to the heart of investor psychology. People trust other people. Once it becomes acceptable, people will just not question the underpinnings. It will just be trusted. Like using the browser.

In that case, the buying power of BTC generally has been going up for 4 years, not down, so wouldn't that be a negative rate of inflation?

Or the bots were under hacker control. Agree with your point. Another big change is the off-market buys happening at trading desks. You don't have as many 1000-coin trades winding up the exchanges. Instead, it's kind of funny, a quirk of human nature--they use the exchange as the reference price while trading these big amounts, perhaps bigger than the exchange volume (I don't know the aggregate--certainly single trades are bigger than typical exchange trades).

Hi RushWallet, nice job. I'm a regular kryptokit user and love it.
Couple of comments:
- was impressed when I could send money from kryptokit to rushwallet, then back again, and all unconfirmed. maybe all wallets work this way but I was pleased no 10 minute delay.
- the "receive" function in rushwallet asks to put in a request amount, so I put in 0.01 BTC. Then I go to krypokit extension (chrome browser on chromebook), and it picks up the address but not the amount. seems strange your two products wouldn't integrate that so it picks up the amount automatically.

@_date: 2014-08-11 17:06:44
Thanks--I think I get this part now. If you didn't allow the miner any controls at all other than maybe a time range (like I originally thought) then I guess the balance of power might be too much against the miners. They might revolt at having no way to backpressure the system to say, "that fee is too low, it's not worth me including it".
By letting them pick a threshold cut in this canonical ordering, then they can say sorry this tx fee is not worth the risk of my adding it because every tx I add increases the risk of peer nodes not decoding my IBLT.
So we would be replacing a pricing structure for transactions from today which is based on a network race condition with one that is based on the statistics of the IBLT lookup failure. If the IBLT were set to be too small, it's possible this would be no progress--that the fee of 0.0008 would still be required. But if the IBLT is big enough and the chance of successfully decoding blocks with lots of tx high enough, the miners would compete to send tx with fees much closer to the network minimum.

Right, I worried about this too. I got over it by calculating that the reliability must be 99.99% given that no-one in my search was complaining about it at all, and second, always generating a handful of addresses so that if I did get bitten by some very rare bug where the address was valid but the bitaddress's private key somehow didn't generate it, that only 1/Nth of my stash would be compromised. I haven't found a suitable alternate javascript site, but didn't look too hard.

@_date: 2014-08-09 04:21:23
It seems also to do things I was worried about with regard to the roll out: (i.e. paving a live highway)
- it incentivizes the miners to adopt this new implementation because the new block done this way will be faster than the old block including all transactions (not true for a mandated large block size)
- it incentivizes the miners to include as many fees as possible per block because they make more fees
@_date: 2014-07-05 03:06:12
Those are pretty insulting posts.
It's clear to everyone that bitcoin is a payment network, and there's a good chance it will make inroads into internet and POS transactions.

@_date: 2014-08-10 18:48:18
Right. The important point a lot of people aren't understanding is that the reason fees are 50 cents or even 5 cents is not the underlying bandwidth cost per transaction, but rather this peculiar incentive to not orphan a block and lose a (rare) block reward, that you said. Someone calculated that at 0.0008 BTC/transaction I think it was just based on the propagation delay causing a chance you'll miss the block reward.
Under Gavin's (or similar) scheme where not only is the block sized fixed but the number of tx in one block can go way up due to cleverly hashing the transactions and re-using the fact that nodes already have most of the transactions, we could see a million tx per block (over 1000 TPS). Then the fee could drop to fraction of a cent. It will come.

You might be younger and not have a lot of savings, but when you work for a bunch of years of hard work, saving a lot, driving an old car, living in not the best house, and finally save some up money, you look for a safe haven. Real estate is probably still the  safe place, but people look for gold, various long-term stocks, whatever they can put their money and hope it's still there and even growing in 10 or 20 years.
Bitcoin has the promise of a safe haven, a new asset class to protect against the shitstorm of wild deficit spending that will at some point cause some big time price inflation. There is a reasonable argument based on its utility that it will grow 10x or 100x. Long shot, but actually plausible. Thems good odds.

(In your article, $70M versus $800M annually in bitcoin; in my own analysis something like $1/day for a chip returning $12/day bitcoin.)
In some mainstream articles about the "environmental menace of bitcoin" etc you see them wrongly use the entire bitcoin mining $ number or a high percentage of it like 90%, as going into electricity.

I think the author is entirely right. In the short term. And it's useful to throw some cold water on people's expectation for a huge run up in price yet this year.
But this is a long-term game. We've got years to get this going, and there is no stopping it that I can see. It doesn't have to go all at once in this calendar year. As long as the VC-funded businesses grow and stay profitable, more merchants adopt it, all the friction around exchanges gets lower (it's still quite high--I wire transfer money to Slovenia, how crazy is that!), bunch of great enabler products keep coming out like hardware and software wallets, new improvements to the technology creep their way out, miners keep investing $ providing a backstop to the price, ... etc etc, then we'll win this long-term game.

Well put, on the strongly normative comment.
Is a popular second codebase going to make, say, increasing the 1MB block size limit harder to roll out? TCP/IP has always had people creeping the spec, the initial window was much larger than 3 in some implementations before 10 was accepted by IETF, as just one example. But there's enough slop there that things still work.

There would be no such thing as a "100MB block". There could be a block with N transactions in it, N pretty large (as big as the invertible bloom filter threshold), but that's the whole point that the new block message is constant size, doesn't depend on # of transactions (because it doesn't actually have the transactions in it, only this clever hash of them). Bandwidth is the new tps limit, but it's the normal bw per node passing tx around as they happen every second, not the once-every-10-minute block messages.

I think btcbaron's point wasn't that users won't want larger blocks, but that miner's won't mine them. Without the IBLT or equivalent innovation, there is a network race cost to mining a large block, so many miners will update to validate larger blocks but won't generate them. A few miners will be nice guys and do a 20MB catch up block every now and then, I imagine.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:48:07
I'll buy that, it's a good argument.
It still is a one-time shot for long-time BIT holders to turn some cash and get their BTC immediately back to what they had (or double their BTC). If I would have known that I would have bought a lot of BIT a year ago! (And other than in the context of the year holding to do it a second time a year later, there is no one-year constraint)

I'm with you on this. All this arguing over $200/year (!) of extra cost per full node is, well, honestly, kind of silly IMO. Hell, I was already working the math on 100k transactions/sec when Gavin proposed the IBLT stuff, and it didn't look very scary for a worldwide financial network, few hundred bucks/day or something, which several hundred (or thousand) institutions worldwide would find easy to pay for and allays my fears of centralization.
Transactions are tiny, disks are really really big. Every time you go to facebook and see an ad you are generating many copies of kilobyte log records. The answer to the scalability problem with bitcoin is to allow it to scale. I think the market will find that solution.

If this is from blockchain.info, it's normal. Suppose you have 2 bitcoins and you try to send 2 btc to your paper wallet public address. It will give you this message, you hit "adjust" and it will then say "sending 1.9999 btc" and everything will work fine. It's just the transaction fee, no biggie. Or you can do a custom transaction and set the miner fee to 0 and maybe wait a while for it to be picked up. Your choice.

Does anybody have a link to a serious study of network propagation delays that analyzes [edit] the idea that always skipping transactions is profitable? The extra delay for typical tx size of couple hundred bytes is on the order of 20 microsec maybe if you are a well connected miner at 100 Mbps? At 25 btc per 500 sec expected, say, that's 0.000001 btc or 1 "bit" (okay, this is a case where the "bits" notation for 10e-6 bitcoin gets confusing).
That would imply any tx greater than 1 bit (0.06 cents) would be worth including, which is a low bar to meet.
Even at 100x my delay estimate, it's still about an even wash for $0.06 tip which is typical.
So I wonder if this effect is blown up anecdotally.

@_date: 2014-08-11 16:40:10
Right. It's actually even one level neater, where after you subtract out your best guess at the transactions that are in the block (and by the way, that can be done in O(m) time, which is essentially O(1) time since m is fixed, based on that second paper's automagical "IBLT subtract" op), you look for cells with count=1 *and* cells with count=-1. As you unwind those from the diff_IBLT you can find more cells with count=1 or count=-1. They call this "peeling". And this is all the full transaction content, not just the ID. So after you are done you get (in my example numbers) up to 1500 actual transactions out of the 1MB IBLT that you didnt have, or that you mistakenly thought were part of the solved block.
Edit: peeling, not "unpeeling". ha ha

Sorry for late reply. I just meant it's random. You get natural variation. Poisson is just the particular type of distribution you get with many independent variables aggregated. Any miner has a chance to solve the block. Some blocks take 50 minutes, about once per two days I figured out once.

I know you were tongue-in-cheek, but it should be a valid claim as long as it's power consumption to capex ratio is lower than today's chips, which is likely.
There is something pleasing about this--the total mining investment is probably better for the world when spent on transfer to other humans (ASIC design salaries, company employees) than on pure power generation. When I worked the numbers on a latest chip last fall, I got only about 20% of the total investment went to power, but it also depends how you model out the usage tail when power burn is higher. A latest chip like this should shift it even lower.

Right, I'm with you. Anyone who has already held BIT for a year can arbitrage with those shares, buying back into BIT immediately to backfill. So it's zero risk for them, there's no one-year exposure to price. The only thing is the amount of arbitrage is limited to what you've already held for a year.
I'm guessing (without any data) that there is still lots of friction in the legacy broker system--people trying to get their broker to honor their BIT -&gt; GBTC conversion, waiting for customer support.

That's exactly the difference in attitude between the camps, though.
A large blocker would say, the user pays for their transaction with their fee. Even 1 cent pays for storage and relay of their transaction 10k times. They are free and clear morally after paying that.
But I understand the small blocker point, that the transaction payment doesn't cover the risk to the security model. It's why we need two coins, we'll never resolve this fundamental difference of outlook.

I thought about a solution in which you send a Bloom filter marking the transaction ids as well as the full IBLT with the actual transaction content, to make the system robust against larger differences in the solver's and receiver's transaction sets. To target 1000 TPS, or 600k per block, a BF calculator gives 2MB size for a 1e-6 error rate. This would let you use a smaller IBLT and really stuff it full, knowing that it can be unwound back below the threshold. Also, the solver could then more confidently omit all recent transactions (30 sec?) which I assume are mostly the ones causing the diff in sets.
On the other hand, Gavin's scheme AAUI has a beneficial incentive where the solver wants to guess the exact state of the receiver's full pool, because if their guess is too far afield--either way--the diff will exceed the IBLT threshold and not be decoded. A scheme like I'm proposing would allow the solver to undershoot (even to the point of sending an empty block) and get away with it, perhaps even with a benefit of faster block propagation if the receivers decide to decode before propagating a block.
Edit: to clarify, I intended the second paragraph to describe a shortcoming of my scheme (allowing non-full blocks)

I don't care about the particular details of how or when MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is determined, as long as the promise that it will be raised when needed is kept before it holds back adoption.
I'm not opposed to layers on top of Bitcoin but it's a mistake to assume that's what the users of Bitcoin want and need. I get the strong impression that some people who want to promote their preferred alternatives aren't sure those alternatives will be compelling enough for people to adopt them unless Bitcoin is prohibited from becoming too useful.
Don't hold artificially hold back Bitcoin to create a market for somebody's pet project. Let Bitcoin become as useful as possible and those other layers can be adopted or not based on their own merits.

$600 sounds high, I'm curious where you get that. If you can get your hands on a state of the art asic for 1 BTC worth of USD right now, you get about $1000 of BTC out of it over next 18 2016-block periods, spending $266 in electricity (at $0.10/KWh). That's from a simplified model of $1/GH and 1W/GH ASIC, which for each 1kW mines you $0.60 for every hour at 150 PH/s, and every period that goes down 14% increasing the portion used for electricity until after 18 periods it loses money to power it on. And assuming BTC price stays constant.
But I know these type of calculations depend a lot on the initial conditions. You slip it out 2 or 4 weeks (realistically) and there goes the profit.

His last paragraph sums up the philosophical difference for me, and where I believe traditional bitcoin devs are out of touch with the pragmatic users of today. Most people *are* totally okay with some number of "organizational entities" running the nodes as good enough decentralization.
I wouldn't go so far as to say "Google-scale". There's a huge gap between node requirements exceeding a small home computer which 20MB just barely does, and jumping all the way to Google scale. We have a lot of in between room to scale before the nodes are that big an endeavor, but yes I think that is where most people in the regular user world think bitcoin should go as it grows. It seems more obvious than adding new undefined additional layers on top.

Excluding popular removes a lot of early noise from satoshi dice etc. It more clearly shows the good 2x/year exponential growth story, which is comforting, as long as it's not fabricated as someone already posted here.

Thanks for the post. Shows how tiny bitcoin is, how far it could go if things just keep chugging along. Time is on our side. You know how a startup has two phases--where you are spending money and time is against you every day until your cash runs out, and the second phase when you break a profit. That second phase is like, we are going to be a success, just don't screw up. That's where bitcoin is. The machine is working.
I worked out the math once on market volume vs. market cap for bitcoin compared to bunch of mid cap companies and it was favorable to bitcoin's liquidity.

Many folks are missing the point of this. I heard him interviewed on LTB I think it was, but now I can't find the episode.
What he's doing is very different from building another exchange. He's packaging up bitcoin as an investment package for wall street, with the right "API" if you will to interface with their standard bidding, closing process, etc using a "swap" as the investment unit.
He matches longs and shorts. He said the interest he gauges is about 80% long and 20% short. So if he can't match up long/short then he takes the longs and turns around and buys the underlying asset in order to match. I don't know the terminology, but it's like buying in the house to match his customer, but it's with the long-buying customer's money. He's a middleman, he doesn't have to front the money or take risks.
So it's innovative. Regular Joes underestimate the friction in dealing with day-to-day wall street methodology, I think. He's removing that friction. And if his 80/20 number is to be believed, it will have a lift effect on bitcoin demand, not a shorting effect.

you should read (below). there's a great section there saying don't sweat the traders. their trades have to come full circle and close out their trades. so if you are willing to withstand the short term ups and downs, the traders can't damage the long term price. and if a little bit of shorting causes the house of cards to come down, it wasn't very secure to begin with.

yeah, who knows. it's all psychological. like for gold, the mining cost of $1200 or whatever sets a floor for the traders I think. for bitcoin, it's this group think that says, ok, these miners have all invested so much to mine this stuff, it must be worth it! then after enough people think that way, it actually is worth it. biggest mindbend of our century.

Staying just ahead of non-spam demand is all we need, right? Free stuff can be tx market deprioritized as already happens now.
And if they are 20MB of 0.0001 fee 500B tx, that's 4 BTC! As long as the miner can get it propagated through the network significantly faster than (total effective) 1.6 Mbps by my calculations to win the block race, they benefit.

Thanks for the analysis, I was about to do the same.

United Kingdom has signed Model 1 IGA (intergovernmental agreement) in FATCA, so your account info is already being reported to the IRS via the UK banking reporting system. Or if it hasn't, it probably will or could be at any time. In fact, Slovenia has signed model 1 too now, which was news to me, so either way it's already being sent around what your name is and that you hold USD there. I doubt they tie it to any bitcoin address, though, on the bright side. This isn't too big a deal because you probably are already reporting your balance with an FBAR and 8938. If not, be careful of the harsh 50% penalties.

A thought experiment I like is if we encountered an advanced alien civilization, one that has lasted through different governments and societal organization. You could imagine a bitcoin-like currency being what they use ("intergallactic credits") as perfect money. In fact, it's all they could use. No metal, or central issued fiat would work.

There's a whole bunch of detail here. Miner can do what they want, but it affects their chance of getting a winning block propagated. Currently it is a (very small incremental) disadvantage to include a transaction, but in the future with IBLT implementation it will be a small incremental advantage to stay with the consensus and avoid a larger set reconciliation process. Go listen to one of the recent let's talk bitcoin interviews with Gavin for a whole lot more. It's good stuff, and the future is bright.

Don't think so (that core will just play along). There's too much ego at stake. Plus people like nullc (reasonably) don't want to be responsible for the security of a system that has fundamental parameters they disagree with.
This is a true civil war and we are fighting over the "country" asset--largely the POW infrastructure built up to date and the entire ecosystem of wallets and exchanges and payment processors and marketing value. Both sides want the other side to move to another country and do their laws there, giving up all rights to the asset.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:02:36
You can't honestly think that.
They just have different values. They value serving user demand for transactions, which you don't. I get that. I don't claim core is trying to submarine the currency or being shortsighted or blinded by greed because their views are different than mine.
The problem with average Joe trying to understand Core's ideology is that there has never been any quantitative argument--actual math--why simply growing the blocksize is a bad direction or not tractable with some reasonable engineering. You guys don't realize how tiny 1MB every ten minutes sounds to anybody working in production systems, or really anything in computing.
It's always just this "feeling" that it would make it more corporationy by increasing node cost, or misapplied arguments that bitcoin is O(N^2) security model (it isn't in practice with delegation). So it just comes off as a religion, bunch of edge folks that don't trust any government or corporation.

You have it right. If you have coins before the fork, you can spend them (differently) in both forks. That's one reason why existing holders aren't completely freaked out by it. It could be messy, but there is confidence one side would win and it would sort out.
Hopefully of course, a majority wins (months) early, which is measurable, and there's isn't any fight at the time of fork.
Interesting to think of human history of forks. Religions have gone sectarian at some point splitting into two. Of course, only once every many hundred years, on average, and there must have been many unsuccessful attempts. It would take some major philosophical divide.
What is curious is that the blocksize is sort of one of these divides: should "1MegCoin" remain and TX space be this elite resource going to top bidder, deferring all other transactions to higher layers, or should bitcoin scale to natively provide transactions for all.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:55:45

(honest question)
What is your plan when Joe six-pack wakes up summer 2016 and tries to buy something with his old bitcoin wallet? And it doesn't work.
Is there any scaling solution besides scaling block size that is backwards compatible from the user's perspective? (That doesn't require new wallets, new everything.)
EDIT: I re-read your (good!) OP-linked arguments. You have this quote:


I claim there is: 20MB allows the current(*) user base with their currently installed software using the current bitcoin-supporting merchants at their current usage rate and all other current uses of bitcoin to work for the next few years without a discontinuity.
(*)I used "current" to mean now and near-future extrapolated.
EDIT2: You also say:


It's very hard to force free-market systems to go uphill, I think. They just do gradient descent. The argument that we must endure some pain to force the right incentives, sounds more like central-planning, and unlikely to survive the many forces that would see this pain.

Ah, you're interested in exactly when as we get to 50%, 60%, 70% full blocks when we start delaying transactions based on what fees they are?
It's mildly interesting, I guess, especially to see if March 2016 is early enough to avoid widespread pain.
But I guess overall I'm not super interested in that question because at some point (in the 1MB scenario) the shit will hit the fan, and TX space will be a limited resource and there will be a free market. Can't simulate that with very high fidelity in advance--what people will pay for different types of transactions as they fight to get into a block.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:14:59
Exactly backwards. We want the absolute minimal fork to minimize the opposition to it, so we can get it done. Then once we crack the FUD open and it's not a big deal, time later to carefully do other things the economic majority approves of.

The only problem is that, like the characters in the movie, shorting the whole world economy is a bet you don't want to win. I'm not saying you won't win it, but buying bitcoin in the hopes that the whole world economy goes down the tubes,... the payoff may be too late to really help you.

I agree a "good riddance" attitude would be very wrong, just like it was wrong to apply to Mike.
But I don't think there's that much SW dev work to do to keep the ship running at 2 MB (growing more requires work but the current devs weren't excited about that anyway). Peter Todd has been quoted that bitcoin is done, except for his time lock verify stuff which I assume will still be in classic--that would be a whole 'nother fight which I don't expect classic to take on. (They better not, to be smart about just getting in the 2MB.)
I'm hopeful calmer heads will prevail.
@_date: 2017-02-05 03:50:55
This is actually a very telling remark. Small blockers are the techies, with the attitude that Bitcoin is supposed to be for people who are technical. Pure users are looked at with some disdain.
I think we're to (past) the point where a fork will let both camps just move on from all this. May the best coin win.

There are a few solid use cases so far, mostly involving sending money to your brother in Austria, or donating money directly to a Kenyan charity. That kind of thing.
If you don't have those use cases, you can either speculate by buying it for investment, and hope to get 10-100x return (but also possibly lose it). OR you can buy some and just have fun sending it around to friends. If you don't have friends who care, that isn't as much fun. It's a network effect product, like facebook. If your friends aren't using it, not that much fun unless you are a geek.

Yes. This is the whole thing right here.
I was arguing with a dev in one of these reddits and he said, "but that's not the way science should work." This is NOT science, this is production deployment! $7B market cap and $1B VC invested.
We are not in a little experiment here developing neato features worried about increasing the chance of a government takeover by 1% because a hobbyist stops his node. We are delivering transaction capability to the world in an entirely new form of money, and to anybody EVER who has worked in a production system, capacity planning is the most obvious thing to give priority to.

You're saying you would just wait and see? I can't see that happening.
The scenario we are discussing is the 75/25% hash split in favor of BU (however likely or unlikely you feel that to be). Furthermore, we're not discussing the Charlie Lee case where the BU miners look at the price on the exchanges and immediately switch back to Core. (Although that's an interesting case...)
In that case, there is no way Core could stay on bitcoin-POW and leave open that big an attack surface, even if the BU miners didn't do any immediate $100M attack.

There should be room for compromise if we can buy some more time. Sort of like the US national debt debate, the political dynamic I mean of this "shutdown" looming.

I'd say Core pretty much villified themselves by not capacity planning and letting blocks fill up, 10 or 20 in a row. I can't think of any technology ever that succeeded by convincing users that it was in their best interest to artificially provision less capacity than their demand for it. Maybe some luxury brand.

Thanks for the comment (sincerely--I don't agree with your positions but I respect them and your work).


I've heard you make this argument before and I don't buy it. To me, selling the service of a secure transaction at $0.02 is profitable (if you work the math on even today's full cost of storing and transmitting 600 bytes 2000 times, say, which to me is enough decentralization). So it's a product that has a positive margin for the bitcoin network. There's no reason we have to sell it for free. $0.02 secure, reliable transactions is a great business plan. Scale it up!
So to me increased demand is a great thing. To say otherwise is like Google complaining that there is too much demand for search.
I know we just differ on our definition of "good enough" security though, and that is irreconcilable.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:27:32
Oh, but that's the entire conflict right there summed up, don't you see?
@_date: 2015-05-07 06:00:01
For the *providers* of the service, right? All user (non-full-node) wallets keep working fine. That's worlds different.
I think we have very different bitcoin success scenarios in our heads, and we're both rationally optimizing our scenario. Mine is that 99.99% of the people on the planet who are engaged with bitcoin are users and don't know a full node from their ass but they just want shit to work, and 0.01% are providers running the whole thing with enough diversity that the rest can trust it.
@_date: 2015-05-07 05:09:09
It's a correct answer, but I would argue not important for most users or for bitcoin on the whole to be secure "enough".
I've worked so many years in at the high-tech customer/provider boundary, my frame of reference in bitcoin is USER USER USER. And I mean a typical user, who is willing to delegate trust, and just wants to buy something next year with some bitcoin they bought this year, with the same wallet they used, and just have stuff work.
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:47:55
Not that nervous. Most of the work they've been doing is on a vector that most mainstream growth-on-chain users don't want.
Core will refuse to work on classic or to push a 2MB patch, so this will result in a nice layering in which the hardcore core devs are freed to work specifically on LN. Which is great because if it works then groovy.
But bitcoin itself won't be corrupted to support it as an incumbent. It has to earn it. If you are confident of LN's benefits then this should not scare you at all. And if you think the underlying bitcoin is going to be too insecure, just aim LN's backbone at something else.

That clock uses 10 minute blocks and historically it's run about 12% [faster]( due to both increased $ invested and more hash power per $. New ASICs are being deployed as we speak.
So that puts it 20 days shorter, at June 27, by my quick reckoning.
Nice fireworks for 4th of July weekend in the US! (Although I don't expect anything right then--I think of it as a step function smoothed over a year to either side of it by people's guessing)
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:10:26
A cryptocurrency has a product, which is transactions. Strong demand for the product is a good thing, not a bogeyman. It allows the providers to increase prices in order to get positive margin, and this in turn allows an increase in the supply. This is the wonderful magic of free markets which instances like Venezuela are demonstrating serve an absolutely crucial role to organize the information of costs and value among many independent people in the supply chain.
The challenge with bitcoin taking the ideological high ground and refusing to increase supply is that it fights a ground truth: storing a few hundred bytes even 10k times and sending it around even to thousands of nodes (even in the worst case broadcast scenario) actually doesn't cost very much. Bits are really really cheap--you can do the math. The bitcoin network taken as a whole makes money even at 5 cents a transaction and at today's costs.
Serving only the high-end and refusing to adapt in order to serve the surging demand for high-volume low-cost customers is pretty much the recipe for every technology obsolescence in history, from mainframes to minicomputers to Microsoft to SGI and graphics cards to Minecraft to ...
I know, somehow cryptocurrency is supposed to be different. But I don't think in this regard it is.

Fair enough. I don't have a dog in this particular fight so I'm also curious how it will play out.

If you held a lot of bitcoin, it's not the same thing at all.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:53:35
Because a reasonably likely scenario is the majority of miners who signed up for the 2x fork in November switch to BCH instead at that time, making it the dominant hash power sha256 coin.
That's the only reason I can see BCH being worth so much now.
I don't have a dog in this fight, but if I did I'd bet more on the 2x fork in November than BCH. I think that miners will still largely stick to their agreement, regardless of this subreddit or core devs or adam back, and there will be a PoW change.

BIP 100 basic idea seems ok, especially given the early action we've seen of miners putting the BV header in for 8MB, that's promising (even though 90% seems a high bar)
But the wording is weird to me.
* one­way lock­in
upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks
* Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top
20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.
So 90% of the blocks in (any, rolling? or fixed?) 3-month window have to have at least some BV marking? And then what is the point of saying drop the top 20% if you are taking the floor at the low 20% anyway?
@_date: 2015-08-09 04:23:37
I was thinking this, at least for myself, since the core devs have totally spooked me in that they may not ever want btc to scale, which is certainly a different vision for bitcoin than I've always had. But reading other comments, most people seem to be blowing it off. So I think it's other transient news, in fact.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:20:06


Well, there's your answer then. The 8MB isn't going to happen without a hard fork. So you can decide what to do. Live with 1MB, or fork.

What do you do when the other side doesn't budge an inch, but you know something has to be done to avoid breaking the bitcoin user experience? It boggles my mind how the core devs can be this irresponsible to users.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:40:11


Less damaging than halting bitcoin's growth. All value in bitcoin comes from usage growth. Break bitcoin's reliability ("here new user, try this cool way to send money... whoa, sorry it didn't work this time"), and that's where you damage bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:02:06
Thanks guys for the comments! I wasn't getting any love :-)
From your comment BitFast, I gather that if we can't do both 1) keep a full node costing the same $ as now and 2) scale up to meet user demand, that you would prioritize 1. That's the part I don't get--to me, decentralization is a feature of a product whose purpose is to serve user demand for transactions, and the latter should take priority.
Hopefully there is a compromise core devs can live with, closer in to measured user demand, that keeps bitcoin from breaking (i.e. reasonable transactions don't complete).
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:20:16
I think you misunderstand my post. I simply meant, there is no way to increase the blocksize without a hard fork to the chain. That's not a political statement, it's a fact. That *is* the mechanism to make this type of change. If core devs would agree to it, it would be very smooth.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:14:39
An irony is that set reconciliation is the next change on the list to go in after block size increase, if we had growth-oriented core devs, and that would reduce that entire burst of the second transmission of each transaction, probably increasing decentralization by eliminating the burst bandwidth requiremnet. I expect to see set reconcilation (IBLT or variant) to go into XT.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:23:22


it doesn't do us any good to have a decentralized system only for it to turn out not to work for new users.
@_date: 2015-08-09 04:34:23
You could turn it all to gold at amagimetals. Couple pounds of gold would be cool to show off to people. Only half serious, but maybe.
To tie this thread in with the other about "why is the price dropping" I'm curious what is the main reason you are selling? I've thought about selling some due to the block limit fight, but then the devs could turn around and agree to some compromise like 2MB and put the problem off until 2017 and I wouldn't trust my ability to time the market to get back in, with respect to COIN or the halving or whatever else may come out. I want to be in long term so wouldn't want to buy back in at higher.
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:32:17
If Peter Todd blocks all proposals to increase the blocksize, overplaying his hand IMO, what are the non-XT outcomes? Could Gavin or Jeff do a commit to core, and if Peter reverses it, remove Peter's commit rights?
I'm just trying to figure out the end game scenarios. I don't see a way bitcoin becomes successful without growing.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:17:57
Good comment. The no-growth camp has two tactical advantages right now (the status quo of the 1MB limit, and the majority of core devs on their side) but they risk winning this battle to lose the war. The vast majority of economic players in bitcoin want to see a pro-user growth strategy, whether XT or something else.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:35:38


It's because it's engineering arguing with an ideology of decentralization. There isn't any numeric argument you can produce that will convince the core devs that decreasing the number of operating full nodes isn't so bad that they'd rather prevent bitcoin from serving user demand than let it happen.
Read Mr. Maxwell's whole thing about he'd rather quit than produce "another corporate payment rails solution" or something like that. Somehow, having fewer nodes like 1000 == Visa to him. That part I just don't get. 1000 nodes seems workable to me, if it allows bitcoin to continue growing.
Bitcoin not working is the showstopper to me. You refer to a friend, and she tries it, and it doesn't work.
So from what I've read in past week, seems like it's a real sectarian rift, that will result in either XT picking up momentum (seems unlikely unless some sort of consortium of players gets together and backs it) or the devs will let bitcoin actually break, price plummet, and then the big miners will realize that's no good for them.
Fortunately, the fix is one constant! (plus the roll-out logistics, of course) So long term, sanity will reign is my belief.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:33:57

It's a good summary, best in this thread I think. Ideology is at the heart of this, not technical details.
nit: I think you meant "not something that should *ever* happen"
Also, I would add to your statement:


that also this side feels what's needed is higher software velocity on set reconciliation and other things that go with a larger block size.
I think you really nailed it with the belief that the small blockists feel bitcoin is broken in a pure theoretical sense, "so why bother", where the others believe it works well enough to scale with just some mods.

Because he doesn't care about meeting user demand
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:10:46
Any blocksize increase less than the demand growth will cause bitcoin to break. By "break" I mean someone tries to use it, and the transaction doesn't complete.
I really don't get how this doesn't scare the shit out of the core devs, more than centralization concerns. When bitcoin breaks, it qualitatively changes forever. It loses all utility. I can no longer send some to my brother. I can't buy things online. I can't wire btc to or from exchanges. If it doesn't just die, there will be some ridiculous fee war for some very few winners.
Why did you start working on bitcoin in the first place, wasn't it to do one of these things? What are the things that you care about that will still work in a world where demand is greater than the capacity of the system? Why will it matter then how de-centralized it is?

By "authority" I think you mean someone representing what has been called the "economic majority" in the bitcoin ecosystem: big payment providers and exchanges, and big miners. I also am waiting for them to come together with a single voice, favoring growing bitcoin. Whether that means encouraging core devs to compromise on a higher limit or forking to XT or what I don't know.
All bitcoin value derives from usage growth, due to network effect, and these players aren't pivoted by decentralization ideology, so I think their viewpoint will be clear. They will have to convince the Chinese miners, though.

This doesn't make sense. The btc1 replay protection is for transactions on btc to not get replayed on 2x. It should have no effect on native 2x use cases.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:24:53
Thought exercise: let's assume a majority of miners stick to their 2x plan, even if some defect. Then you'd just have two networks running side by side. Replay protection isn't a hard requirement for the networks to run, it just offers people peace of mind knowing sending A-&gt;B is on one chain or the other exclusively.
What will tip this thing off this unstable equilibrium is the price on exchanges. Presumably at least some exchanges will offer pricing for both coins, letting the market signal. Internally they can keep their books completely separate even if transactions on the network are confusing, so that's probably enough for trading to happen and pricing.
The exchanges do have a lot of power here, in the way they present "reality"--which one they call "bitcoin".
Then the interesting thing will be the miner behavior after that signal stabilizes (a few days? a week?)

Why would you say bitcoin is a failed experiment? There are disagreements, but transactions work and value is stored.
All this fighting over forks and features is just part of the plan. It's ugly, but letting the actors play out their roles is the only way through it. The same way that BCH got forked, got priced, and now has a (small) place in the whole crypto ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:32:12
Nothing will get messed up. 1x and 2x will be available to trade on the exchanges, the most valuable coin will win. The other will linger on. Actually, 2x might not linger if 1x wins, because support may coalesce back to BCH. And if 2x wins, 1x probably will have to PoW fork, but it will exist.
But in any case, things should shake out just fine here.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:08:25

0. ledger in grandma's head or a stick or whatever, but that breaks a trust boundary when scaling beyond your own clan, so leads to:
1. collectibles, which breaks when not reliable/durable enough, leads to:
2. metals, but then
3. govt want to be involved to control it, pretend there is more than there is, borrow ahead from future society
4. bitcoin ledger

Right, but the context is sales tax.
[No sales tax on download only software is common](
So within that context it makes some kind of sense not to sales tax intangible bitcoin purchase for USD.

I don't see a problem, just report when you bought (or acquired them), what the basis was (or zero if you want to be safe), and when you sold them. There's no "how did I acquire them" on the tax form.
An aside: don't sell just under $10k every month or you might look like you are structuring your payments to avoid reporting, and big bad mens can [take your money]( or so I read.

Jesus Christ, people, enough with the pedantic answers. OP drank a cup of water in San Francisco. He wants to know where it came from. If you assume even mixing at every point, a perfectly valid and useful answer is to say it came 58% from Hetch Hetchy, 12% from Sacramento River, and 30% from some storage tank in the Santa Cruz mountains collected by rainfall. We all get you cannot mathematically guarantee the atoms he actually drank are from that ratio, yet the ratios are interesting. (i.e. that there is no chance it came from the Nile River)

I thought btc1 has that opt-in version of replay which is good enough to let coinbase do these operations already.
Also, even if they didn't, coinbase can keep internally the accounts separate, and wait on deposits/withdrawals.

It brings a new type of buyer into play. All else being equal (i.e. current BIT holders want to keep holding BTC in some form after they convert to GBTC and sell), this should create a bit of upwards price pressure. The theory being, if BIT holders wanted to sell, they could already.

That's a velocity of money argument in which it seems you've picked the absolute minimum of 10 minutes, in and out of bitcoin like a hot potato. I think this is the argument consistent with Warren Buffett's stance that bitcoin isn't worth anything because it's just the "check" in a transmission system.
USD velocity is what, 1 or 2 transactions per year. Reality for bitcoin will be somewhere in between, I'd say; closer to weeks or months than 10 minutes. Even if someone isn't using bitcoin as an investment, it's likely people that do use it for transactions (in the bitcoin success scenario) will keep a small amount in bitcoin.

The honest answer:
- prevailing consensus on r/bitcoin is that if exchanges offer both btc1x (probably called "btc") and btc2x, that btc will be priced much higher. There is no backup plan.
- prevailing NYA consensus is that &gt;90% of the hash rate and therefore users will follow the 2x "upgrade" (probably called "btc"), and there is no replay protection as a backup plan.
Result: if either side is right, bitcoin in one form or another lives on. If the reality, no matter what outcome anyone wants, is anything in between, it will be a big mess.
But it will sort out, by the mechanism of pricing the two coins. That's the "user" evidence you can't fake (a la BCH).
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:06:03
I think you can't outdo the power of the exchanges in setting incentives in this fasion. Exchange price will determine what happens here. Exchanges exist because one-off offers like what you are suggesting just don't scale that well.

Thanks. That's encouraging.
In this panel discussion, I would have liked to have said a few more direct things to move this debate along. (I would have liked or to prompt for these more hardball questions!)
For instance:
- Admit that from the pure technical aspect of the bitcoin network, that if we were to move to 8 MB (or X MB) with core dev consensus, that the network would work just fine. The risks of an uncontroversial fork are low for maintaining functionality, even if we lose some nodes due to higher node cost. This admission wouldn't give up any ground on the decentralization stance, but would clarify the argument and move us past this FUD.
- Admit that we are currently on a collision course with exponential organic usage growth and a hard cap. If nothing is done, there will be failure modes of some kind. and have articulated these carefully. By not acknowledging these failure modes it pins the discussion to endless rehash and we can't move on. Again, this doesn't give up any ground on the decentralization stance.
- Admit that right now we're already seeing 4-5 full blocks in a row at times, so it's likely that some users are feeling the pain already (they tried to use the system in an appropriate way, and it failed for them). Bitcoin is highly resiliant, so it will cope with this pretty well, for a while--maybe 3 months?
- Clarify in specific terms how far "into the wall" the core devs, in particular, intend to take us. There has been some written about desiring a fee market, in order to create incentive for layer2 solutions. This might be very tricky to manage. A reasonable observer looking at this can conclude that the core devs are playing with fire. I'd like to know what their intent is. If 0.0002 ($0.07) transactions won't work anymore reliably for a typical user (say), how about 50 cent? $1? What is the core dev thinking on specifically how much fee pressure is reasonable.
- With the analogy to IETF mentioned in this debate, I would have liked to ask: this situation is different than say Ethernet vs. Infiniband, in that we have proponents of Infiniband sitting on and in fact dominating the committee that decides the rules for Ethernet. We have the wrong dynamics for a true competition between technical directions. If layer2 solutions could thrive in a "fair" playing field where bitcoin core isn't handicapped, then I think everybody would be wildly supportive.

Ha! That's rich. Market forces generated by artificially limiting supply, you mean. That's not free market, that's regulation. Free market is when the blocksize is unlimited and miners themselves say, sorry it's not worth it to me to confirm this TX because you didn't pay enough fee.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:59:15
r/btc people have "lost" the battle (in the sense of the original Satoshi/Gavin/Hearn vision taken away and no attempts successful in past couple years to get it back) so they have loser's bitterness. If 2x were to win in the sense of a higher market cap after all this fork stuff, I can guarantee you r/bitcoin will turn very bitter.
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:35:23
If blocksize were to go up, and the decentralization cost not weighed so heavily, there's no reason to have fees increase. So your conclusion depends on the status quo, which is under attack and in my judgment won't withstand the economic forces that favor the user.
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:11:46
Because if you scale Ethernet, you don't need Infiniband. Good enough wins.
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:02:18
Hmm, too much polite fiddling while Rome burns. The capacity cap is very real and we're about to hit it, with big repercussions. All kinds of posts to reddit about "why is my transaction not completing" even though I put a $1 fee on it.
I would have a lot easier time siding with gmaxwell if he 1) said yes this is super important NOW and we are focused on it (instead of always talking about the balance of so many other things people are working on), and 2) saying something like, "don't worry, of course we will put in temporary blocksize increases to get us through this next year while we figure out the layer2 stuff".
Instead I have a pretty strong idea that he's really ready to run bitcoin into a wall in a few months, and he is ready to accept the cost of that in turning away new users. That's unforgivable to me! New users == value.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:44:05
Crypto is competitive from the point of serving users. It's not likely that bitcoin can survive a 5-year window to address this.
BTW, your posts come off condescending, insinuating that people who don't agree with you haven't done research or don't care about bitcoin's value. I know you have a lot to say, I've read your long posts on r/bitcoin. I think you would be more effective if you drop the personal pokes.

This is great news. Happy to hear.
The "SecondMarket bid" is the syndicate bid, I doubt any SM money itself because they would be competing against their individual investors, so it's not SM itself, it's the aggregate bids. I don't think a lot of folks get that. So you'd expect the SM bid to be below market, because those individual bidders in the syndicate could all buy their volumes at the exchanges or OTC at market price plus about 1-2%.
So the fact that SM won the second auction was bearish--went below market price. That they didn't win the third auction is bullish--went at least near market price if not over. At least the SM syndicate didn't win.

I like that "bitcoin is the rebirth of savings". Nice.
People love to hoard. It's just in our nature, I believe. There's a deep satisfaction of accumulating something that you believe to be valuable, and you know is scarce. You can trust it, and that amps up the hoarding instinct. Wait until a few more halvings and we get towards the end of the coin distribution phase, then things are really going to heat up. Assuming no major disaster along the way, imagine in 10 years when we're down to just a dribble of coins mined. Then when you grab one you'll be quite content.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:21:57
sure, that's why I said "something that you believe to be valuable, and you know is scarce".
by the way, your example is not scarce at all. the scarcity in domain names.com is to use combinations of known words, which are quite scarce. Ask anybody who just paid 6 figures for a domain name.

Two routes to USAA
You can take part in USAA products even if you don’t qualify for membership. You can still use the investment services that USAA offers, you can purchase life insurance from USAA, and you’re eligible to use their discounts (which I’ll cover in the next article); however, if you don’t qualify for membership, you’re not eligible for the auto, property, and other insurance products, and **you cannot use the banking products**. The bank and the credit cards are awesome, as we’ll see in the second part of this series, but the insurance products are what make USAA special.

US public doesn't have to pay that back, it's sloshed out to the banking system and as I understand it most of it is back at the fed on deposit again. So US public is on the hook for some nice fat fees and interest, but the principal is still there.

Whoa, wait a minute. I checked some recent transactions from the same kryptokit and the transaction fee it's paying is sometimes 0.00010001, instead of just 0.0001. So this may be a bug in kryptokit and not rakuten. (Although you'd think rakuten would allow any difference under a cent to go through to avoid such a problem.)
Anybody have any kryptokit knowledge here? I can't even find where to set the fee in the kryptokit drop down, to check that it is set to 0.0001 and not 0.00010001 (although it uses 0.0001 most of the time). This should all be int64 in satoshis, so I can't believe it would be a floating point rounding error.

Honest question: how is it possible that segwit gets activated by Aug 1? 47% miners are signalling now, so either another 48% start signalling with core, or 80% switch to a software load that will trip it at the reduced 80% threshold, is that right?

oh come on, it's a pretty cool idea! probably not worth doing, or if it happens it's in the way detail of some new ASIC, but it's novel.

Making money in free-market capitalism is precisely the signal that you are providing products and services that provide value to society. So they are one and the same.

Here's a quick recipe.
Go find yourself a calculator like  Any will do.
The poisson variable is 1. This means you are interested in whether one event occurs or not in your interval.
If you want to see how likely it is you get no mining in exactly 10 minutes, set the average rate of success to 1. This means you expect 1 mining per 10 minutes. You'll get 0.368. This means 37% chance that you find zero occurrences within a span of 10 minutes. (It's also 37% that there is exactly 1, and the remainder of the probability is that there will be &gt; 1 block found in that time span)
For 20 minutes, set the mean frequency to 2. Then you get 14%. For half hour, it's 5%. This means if you were to take 20 independent half-hour spans of time (10 hours), there is expected to be one half-hour span that will have no blocks mined (I think I've reasoned that correctly).
So for 60 minutes, it's 0.25%, or you would need to wait 400 hours for a 60-minute interval to pass with no blocks mined.
For 80 minutes it's 0.00033, or 0.033%, or this should happen once about every 166 days.
Did this happen just now? If my math is correct, it's pretty rare.
Of course, there will be minor (not miner!) tweak to the math for the whole "difficulty is not exact" thing.

I wasn't saying the argument isn't logical. I can buy subjective values. Just that it doesn't matter much since it's a low percentage of the overall value. Even your example is only 10%.


Not in this post, true. But in many other references to MR = MC in attacks on PoS.

There's no way $1 will hold, it will go under that. No way the global bitcoin buyers will be about to cough up $7200 PER DAY to pay for all those new coins.

In this case glib may be right, though. Most of the innovation doesn't matter to average Joe. The network effect really does. All this stuff about "bitcoin has to be able to start your car with a ledger transaction" or whatever future feature is like saying Coke needs extra flavour burst packets to stay dominant. No, it just needs to be Coke. I think bitcoin is already at that point.

I was confused by this story at first, but it's genesis MINING, not genesis TRADING, that got hacked.

Scaling bitcoin is not that hard a problem to solve, it's just that it hasn't been a problem yet. Today with Facebook for example we solve a much more difficult scaling problem.
Anything that scales linearly with a human action is pretty easy. It's any O(N^2) or scaling with computer-generated actions that gets hard, and there is no architectural roadblock like that in bitcoin.
A bitcoin transaction generated by a human action even stored 1000 times globally is still less than 1 MB, which is way less than a penny. Due to pruning, we don't need to have that many full copies.
In the short term, we're cutting the 1MB a little close with the arrival of Gavin's 20MB, but still that's not been a problem yet.
In the longer term, set reconciliation (the aforementioned I-bacon) reduces the network traffic 2x and more importantly provides an inclusive incentive for miners to verify complete blocks. That is not rocket science; you can verify it in a few hundred lines of your favorite code. It works great. Go read the paper.
Also, go listen to the [Let's Talk Bitcoin]( episode with Gavin and Andreas. It's informative and if you are a bitcoin hodler will be a pleasure to hear.

well, heh, he may not have dived deep but I think he gets the idea that it is solvable. I've dived pretty deep into scalability and am comfortable there will be solutions. No showstoppers to network rate, disk space, cpu, or miner incentives. Issues, but no showstoppers.

The thing that you and nobody else can predict for sure is what the price will be for the two tokens, which after all the difficulty adjustment issues have settled, will determine the mining ratio.
It's pretty gutsy to kick off the fork. But great entertainment!

The problem is that this academic analysis doesn't really matter. It's a correction off in some distant decimal place. Kinda, so what.
Separate from this comment, I've found it ironic that PoW people arguing against PoS because stakers couldn't possibly do something without an economic incentive, themselves rely on people doing exactly that for bitcoin to work: running nodes.

The two camps have become amazing echo chambers.


Just curious, why do you say this? I'm of the opinion that it's a pretty 50/50 civil war, with a strong tactical position held by the small blockers.
I am way less financially involved than I was previously, but I am very curious how the miners will behave here. If they do HF, then the price will no doubt tumble, so they will do it for their belief in the long-term health of bitcoin. Then if core would change PoW that would be awesome, both sides could go their own ways and the market would decide. We would stop fucking each other up.

Patience is thin after three years, though.
Some kind of fork is needed to resolve the two parties. There is no other way. UASF seems a scary way to do it, but it's better than continuing this stalemate another 3 years, IMO.

That's a silly argument though. The premine was fully paid for and those coins are on the market as much as any bitcoin.
So in your example, if I premine 100 coins and sell them for $1 each, then yes the market cap is $100.
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:51:27
Do a mental experiment: the price drops to $150 in June. For real, not a joke. See how you will react if you can convince yourself of the reality. If you are cool and will not panic sell, and will hold until at least mid-2016 halving, then I think you're fine, go for it. 5 grand is not huge money anyway. If you're young you'll get more earning power later.

Mr. Sherlock OP, if you eliminate the impossible, what remains, however improbable, is the true exchange.
I've done some fair buys on it and overall it works fine. Volume is tough, some times I was able to buy with no problem, other times just no coins available for 3-4$ up from market. I like their simple interface, and being in the US for me is a big help. Much quicker and simpler wires.

Every bitcoin owner I know is as honest as Gomer Pyle, so to avoid a capital gain on that appreciated bitcoin you're about to spend you need to buy a new bitcoin first then spend it at the merchant, not spend an appreciated coin and then replenish.
