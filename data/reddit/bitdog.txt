funny eh :)

I agree, but I also feel there MUST be an easier way to convert fiat to BTC and back...

As a minor point, you can buy BTC almost instantly 
IF you live in the UK
IF you have an account with Barclays
and IF you don't mind using Bitbargain

There's a good documentary on the topic: I.O.U.S.A. (  ). There's a free 30-min version of it on youtube. Bit old, but the points are still valid. 
As for the article - I'm not convinced enough that BTC alone can bring the US monetary system, or the country down. It's a country, not a business

I don't have my address printed on checks. What for? Do you have it?

I think this is a great service and I'll be watching you guys. There's way not enough services for converting to and from BTC, it's a dangerous space to operate in and I believe you deserve credit at least because of that

If you're hungry for risk and have some money to spare, why not try and invest it in your own business? Instead of putting all your savings into something that is entirely out of your control why not try and build your own future? Find out what you're made of, learn a ton and then some. Irrespectively of the outcome come out a better man on the other end. THAT is a great opportunity. What you did is not remarkable and is not worth all that attention.

I agree. If this is just your name, account number and sort code then it's reasonably safe to give away

To me, the fact that they're calling a drop from $130 to $120 "rapid and unnatural" really shows that the value of BTC is starting to stabilise

Done! Will post the link on freenode and ask people to report. Didn't know they were still "operating"...
