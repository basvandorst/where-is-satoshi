Not vicious - too strong.  But deleted.

I do my best to highlight dishonesty :)

Fantastic.  Great work.

Not vicious, but agreed.  Deleted.

Yes, that was what I was thinking.

And the penalty would be? - shitcoiner?

Would that allegation of potential and reportable fraud include users of Ver's Bitcoin.com (compromised) wallet, who are unclear whether they are sending or receiving BTC or BCH?

No.  I just came across your post and pointed to the problems with lossiness in compression when it comes to the data in a blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:44:15
..there are surely also information entropy arguments against compressing 10^12 into 10^6.

No real need for a bullish case.
BTC is here, and here to stay.  No-one with any proper sense of the market or understanding of market sentiment and technology doubts that.
BTC will be supported by other finance transfer coins, like Litecoin as its silver, and privacy coins such as Monero.
What all of these coins have in common is honesty.  
Even in a cynical and fast moving market honesty must prevail.
Litecoin has *never* pretended to be BTC.  And Monero -
the Monero community doesn't even care about its price!
BCH is not, in principle, a shitcoin, but it behaves like one in not being honest.  Even its confusing wallet, which conflates and confuses BTC with BCH, has been shown to have massive security flaws.
TL:DR? - honesty and integrity will always conquer the market.
