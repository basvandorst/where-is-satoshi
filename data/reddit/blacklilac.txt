Customers who have orders blades at the higher price point have been compensated for the difference.
Happy mining everyone!

We will be distributing ASICMINER hardware to the public starting tomorrow (August 11th): 
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:37:12
hahahaha this made my day
@_date: 2013-08-28 04:23:23
Is there any product currently shipping that provides anywhere near this value?
Pre-orders are great for risk-takers, but some miners want to  expand their hashrates now.   :-)
@_date: 2013-08-10 22:34:21
We are not THE official distributor, we are AN official distributor. There are several distributors and resellers. I will request that friedcat posts in the 2asic.com thread that will be created once we have products for sale. 
The issue you mentioned will be corrected before we begin accepting orders, thanks.

At the present BTC/USD price that's a $8083 weekly dividend for each board seat! (5000 shares).
Not bad for those smart enough to have purchased that many shares for $6500 at the IPO 10 months ago. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 13:40:30
As Fabrizio89 said, the most likely answer is that friedcat is transitioning to solo mining.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:13:17
Great work!
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:36:38
@ kalner1234, try running 20 or 30 7970s in one room!
I can't believe these things are selling for $800, because ASICMINER is selling them for 1.99 BTC, but they are certainly a revolutionary product worth a good price.

It's the nature of the business. Many people remain anonymous, some for legitimate reasons, some for the purposes of fraud (see pirateat40). However as mentioned, people and companies who have publicly identified themselves have scammed possibly just as much as those who are anonymous.  (see Paul Mumby, Jonathan Ryan Owens, Alberto Armandi, Meni Rosenfeld, Matthew N. Wright, Ben Malec, Tom Williams, Bitfloor, etc etc).
Personally my company has made the decision to be public about who we are and where we operate from... but this has come at considerable expense. We have had to develop a system to securely store our Bitcoin private keys in bank vaults and only bring them online through the banks' secure networks. We still face the risk that some dumb criminal(s) will assume we have thousands of coins on our laptops and stick a gun in our face or something like that. As those familiar with Bitcoin know, they are perfect for criminals due to the ability to mix the coins and the ease with which they can cash our 100% of what they steal.
We have spent tens of thousands of dollars on physical security for our offices, warehouse, and homes. This is in addition to our main focus, which is obviously online security.
So yeah... I can understand why people who control thousands or even tens of thousands of Bitcoins don't want everyone to know who they are and where they live.
@_date: 2013-08-28 06:12:47
All hardware sold on 2asic.com is 100% new. Thank you for raising a question I hadn't considered yet.

Kind of a decent article, except...
"The ex-host of The Bitcoin Show has made a huge amount of money thanks to cryptocurrency. Bruce Wagner was frequently linked to the episode “MyBitcoin scam”, but no one found no evidence of the connection."
No one found any evidence... are you certain about that? He was the primary perpetrator of this scam, and currently owes me approximately one hundred trillion dollars* [*note: base on my long-term valuation of BTC  ;-) ] His "huge amount of money" is thanks to him robbing me and thousands of others, not to Bitcoin.
Other than that, cool article. I'm glad Charlie from BitInstant looks like Charlie from "Always Sunny in Philadelphia". Also, Mark Karpeles from MTGOX is a dead-ringer for Randy from Trailer Park Boys, but only Canadians will have any chance of getting that reference.

Just posted by burnside, operator of BTC-TC:






Shares of ASICMINER have already rebounded to above 4.65 on that exchange. I always feel bad for the panic sellers... but that doesn't meant I don't enjoy making a quick and easy profit because of them.   :-)
@_date: 2013-08-13 01:08:42
I frequent the Sweet Tooth Café, they serve excellent meals in addition to coffee and baked goods. 
I didn't know that Central Bistro accepts BTC, I will have to check them out next weekend.
@_date: 2013-07-10 08:51:19
Are you guys joking? Bitfloor did not pay back any serious amount of the money from the first "hack", nor did they provide any evidence that there actually was a hack. From what I recall they did not provide evidence that they even filled a police report.
I really hope you guys get your money back but I don't think many people consider there to be much hope. It has not been proven but the consensus is that Bitfloor stole the money from the first "hack" themselves, which is why most people steered very far clear of them afterwards.
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:57:40


Sorry to tell you this friend, but those funds have already been stolen by a repeat scam artist, they are not in limbo.
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:51:30
These are selling out all over the place with this pricing. We still have a limited number available for sale:

My business was doing alright, but no.
@_date: 2013-06-21 14:08:06
What runeks said is completely right. 
btc.co is run by burnside, and he is extremely trustworthy and reliable. He handles transfers between his exchange and direct shares extremely promptly and for free.
I have used that method to transfer hundreds of ASICMINER shares between his exchange and friedcat (direct shares).
@_date: 2013-07-28 03:59:50
I'm really tired of hearing about this ripple nonsense. From the very start his post was extremely clear that he was exposing a flaw in ripple, not giving away Bitcoins. He didn't trick anybody... if a "newbie" was too stupid to understand what he was saying, that's their problem.
In fact he did a HUGE service to the community, especially newbies, by clearly spelling out some of the many massive problems with the pre-mine scam now called ripple. He even put personal money into ad spots and his own time creating ripplescam.org.
Ripple is the problem there, not tradefortress. Someone was going to expose this scam... Ripple and everyone else is lucky it was done by someone honest like TF, instead of someone actually milking the flaw for profit.
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:05:06
10% is way too high for me, but if you could get the service working, people would pay it. 5% + $5 or something similar would make this service very attractive.

Just FYI: I'm pretty sure that the big spikes in the dead center of each country are just the total from that country that Blockchain.info can't pinpoint more accurately... not anything happening in the actual physical center of the country.
I agree that the increase in China is almost certainly ASICMINER. They have added (at least) 10 TH/s over the past 10 days or so. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:46:05
Based on their previous complete lack of regard for their (pre) paying customers, this isn't a surprise. 
Thank God there's ASICMINER. At least one Bitcoin ASIC producer is behaving professionally and delivering what they promise and charge for.
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:51:59
Very cool idea, good luck with it. Set one up in Vancouver and I'll be there!
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:04:17
...and yes, my opinions are just that, my two cents. They may only be worth one.
I call him one of the most trusted people in the industry based on my involvement and analysis of this business over the past year, and my personal dealings with TradeFortress and many others involved with Bitcoin.
I have never seen TradeFortress break a contract, say anything dishonest, or do anything else negative. He is well known, runs a number of trusted websites and services, and controls vast amounts of Bitcoin. That is what I based my comment on. This is of course only my analysis, so take it for what it's worth.
@_date: 2013-07-31 00:20:14
This issue has not been publicly address by friedcat yet, and I have to agree with Dabauhs that this is the best guess. 
I would be surprised if friedcat were not working on a fix for this issue.

Can't wait to get mine.
@_date: 2013-06-17 09:05:59
You're probably right. It's a great time to buy Bitcoins right now. Until the price of ASIC miners comes down, the margins of mining are quite low.
@_date: 2013-07-31 00:02:39
I would think that this is an indicator that coinbase is at least considering adding Litecoin.  
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:30:10
This is exclusively from mining and some limited USB sales.
@_date: 2013-08-28 07:16:11
Key word: supposedly
There is no other company that makes Bitcoin hardware for remotely near this price per GH. Anyone can claim that they will have a 2TH/s miner for $5 in the future (funny how they all want you to pay now).
Some people may like pre-ordering products that may or may not exist at some point in the future (but would make massive fortunes if they did exist)... others want real mining hardware. 
These ASICMINER Block Erupter products are far less expensive than GPUs, and all other companies taking your money for ASICs are just fantasies at this point. I understand that everyone wants them for cheaper, I do too, but these are the best value in Bitcoin mining for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2013-07-27 03:34:24
The transaction is sent instantly (zero confirmations), but it comes to the end address at a random time and in multiple payments. These are some of the main features of the "shared send" feature, more commonly known as a coin mixer. 
Don't worry, your coins are safe, and will arrive in less than 6 hours. Blockchain.info is legit.
@_date: 2013-08-11 04:25:15
(Shameless plug)
asicminer.co hasn't been updated since May 4th, the owner has abandoned it. You may want to check out my site,  While it isn't perfect, it has more information than .co and is still updated regularly.
You can even win 3 Block Erupter USBs by guessing next week's dividend on our forum.   :-)

Same here! I sent 1BTC Casascius coins to a bunch of people, and one 10BTC Coin (actually one of those gold-plated bars that I added 10 to). Bitcoins were about $13 then... they are happy about the gifts now.    :-)
@_date: 2013-07-27 03:25:33
Coinlenders.com is as legit as it gets in Bitcoin investments. It's run by Tradefortress, one of the most trusted (and hated for some reason) people in the industry. It is not a ponzi, he lends the coins out at a higher interest rate than he pays... and the bulk of the loans are secured with assets such as shares in Bitcoin companies.
I have personally done over a thousand Bitcoins worth of Bitcoins with him this year.
I can't offer anyone advice as to whether or not using such a system is legal in their jurisdiction, and I have never used the site coinlenders.com itself. I am only speaking as to the credibility of the person behind it.

@_date: 2013-07-22 01:42:03
Myself included. I didn't get to the point of actually setting up the client, but around that time I found out about Bitcoin and decided against using it because it couldn't be spent anywhere. 
At least I was fortunate enough to get in and make a sizable investment when the price was $13, and then again at $30.

So much so that it is shocking that it is from paypal.
"All Bitcoin-related e-commerce should be considered high risk."
Couldn't have said it better myself.
@_date: 2013-08-01 00:02:41
Indeed. It is funny to listen to people who thing that a primary feature of Bitcoin is that it makes it easier to evade taxes. It really doesn't. Cash is much better for such criminals.
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:50:02
That sucks, do you have any recourse with Paypal? I thought they usually side with the seller on tangible items with a tracking number.
Needless to say, if you are able to get your business back on its feet, only accept Bitcoin.
Best of luck.

I own just over 25,000 coins. I can't say exactly what I paid for them, but it wasn't much. 
For what it's worth... I'd buy another 25,000 at today's price if I could, in a year the price is going to increase by a factor of 20.
