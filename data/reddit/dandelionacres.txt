Oh? Where can I buy my drugs now?

Why? Altcoins are (have been) doing pretty good, while bitcoin is foundering right now.  I consider the btg to be "free" money and therefor easy to use for trading to increase my btc stack!

My plan is to cold-storage about 80% where I’m at. The other 20 I’ll keep on exchanges for active trading. Diversify the risk.

Help your dad. He never charged you for teaching how to wipe your ass did he?

Exactly this. My story: I could afford a new truck, and sold the old one and put the cash in my safe. It felt really good having “extra” cash finally for once. But... I started to feel guilty about it not working FOR me. Then crypto entered my consciousness (after a brief but inactive time in 2011). I would not be devastated if I lost that cash, so I trickled in starting in July this year. I am up 4X.  Got in a little tiff tonight with dear wife. Me FUD want to pull my stake, she says HODL.  It’s my call, but she’s right.   I hope.

Dad: OK, I just sent you $6.21 after the fees were taken out...

Do you think it's a good idea to accept other coins as well, such as Litecoin or Ethereum? Others?  I know this is a bitcoin sub but I'm just trying to explore adoption as I think the concept is sound and is here to stay.

Real estate, like gold and like bitcoin, has limited supply.  Supply&lt;Demand=^$

We do not have a POS.  Using Quickbooks and accepting credit cards, ACH and checks.

I'm in Washington.  The ATM I bought my fist BTC charged 10%. Now I have an exchange account so never again stupid fees.  What are/will your fees be?
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:18:18
Bitcash actually makes more sense and is a proper assemblage of letters for one word. Bcash is stated as two words, bitcoin as one.  And in all cases divisible to a Sat (or millisat or whatever).  No matter, this will all stagnate behind the scenes until average Joe (me) can buy buy my groceries without needing a CS degree.

Why would you ask anybody what purpose they had for buying crypto?  Are you like DEA or something?

Ok I'm buzzed enough I'll finally ask - wtf is a satoshi?
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:42:29
I don't know what you mean, but for some reason I'm getting down-voted a lot.  Why?  I do see more retailers beginning to accept BTC, just as more are accepting BCH.  If I can spend it and I can save it what's the big deal about the name?  Is this a future-value thing?  Aren't both chains finite at 21 million units?  I'm in Washington, and the Canadian dollars I have in my pocket are spendable here.  They may not be worth as much as US dollars, but the will get me a package of socks at Fred Meyer.  They both live in my wallet just fine, just like my Bread Wallet has both (three, actually).

Why would this be an "easy" option if you have to pay for the device and then not lose it?  It was pretty darn easy for me to download the free (name one) app to my (name one) smart phone and I'm in control of my own keys, my own security, my own destiny.  Another wallet on my PC, keys to both on paper in my fire safe at home and a copy in my brother's fire safe at his home in case mine is torched by my wife in retaliation for not mining when I first talked about it in 2010.  I bought in at $2700, $2900, $3300. HODL!
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:04:19
Why don't you guys call them BTC and BCH like they are listed on exchanges?  I have and hold both!  It seems like a lot of bickering, I guess I don't understand the depth or accuracy of it all.

That’s an embarrassment to the community. And that singers failed career...

One man's Moon is another man's Mile.  You got in at $1, I got in at $2700.  Your $100 investment then can buy you a house now.  My $10,000 investment can't.  My moon is still almost 240,000 miles away...

There are a number of these in the Seattle area, locate via their website.  I used one at Lynnwood to buy my first several buys starting last July.  Should have done it all at once, thought they limit you to $2500 USD in or out in a day.  THEY CHARGE 10% keep that in mind!
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:55:17
It would be appropriate if we could purchase that directly, with bitcoin.

You guys are a million miles away from a "regular" user being able to buy a coffee.  It needs to be as simple and seamless as me using my Breadwallet at a cashier in about 20 seconds and not having to worry or care about "hops" or "channels" or changing fees.  Let me know when y'all work the bugs out.  And please don't flame me, I understand this is a developmental phase of a new technology. Just know that it will not be adopted unless usable by the (non-tech) masses.

I bought some coin today at a Coinme ATM. Five hours ago, still not to my Coinme wallet. It seems Coinme uses Coinbase which has some problems right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:03:54
Why is it that any of these coins can be so manipulated by one or two people? While I get that fiat can be, to some extent, controlled by government and bankers, if crypto is subject to violent swings just by virtue of a bag holder making a move then it's not reliable for use in real life.  IMHO
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:12:35
I want to be a user.  I have some coin, but no clue of the tech, especially this additional "layer" or whatever.  Smells to me like another avenue to rake fees off for someone to make money.  I'm already informally accepting BTC and BCH for some of my services, and have a strong sense that Joe Public is sure that crypto will be here forever but it's not for this generation because of all the swings and uncertainty.  Why tf is all this other noise in the way? How do you guys think crypto will be adopted by masses, not just tech geeks?

Wow even a simple question like this evokes hate.
