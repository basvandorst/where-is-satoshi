Isn't Venmo much easier than this? There already are apps for regular currency. Converting in/out of Bitcoin and calculating the exchange rate is certainly much more complicated than hopping on VenMo and sending $5 in my opinion. 


Well, the obvious benefit of putting your money into a bank is that it will never be worth *less* than when you put it in. Don't ignore the severe risk of BitCoins drastically dropping in value as they have in the past. BitCoin should be considered more like investing in stock than exchanging currencies. 


I'm not sure how BitCoin differs than any other currency in that sense? You mean because you can transfer it instantly, electronically? We can do that with dollars as well?


BitCoin is absolutely not predictable or stable. It has HUGE variations compared to the dollar [Source]( Sure deflation/inflation is open source, predictable, and ruled by mathematics but that doesn't really matter as much as relative value. 
BitCoin is really cool and I am enjoying it a lot. But you shouldn't understate or ignore the dangers and disadvantages.

It looks like beat me to it and we're going to discuss policies and scam prevention now :D 
This is really fun. We could really use bitcoin to do lots of fun things on the subreddit. Contests, etc.

All banks in the US are FDIC insured, meaning your money is guaranteed by the US government. If the US government is defaulting on those guaranteed investments, then you can be assured that a worldwide financial crisis beyond anything we've ever seen is occurring. In order for my money in an FDIC bank to be defaulted, it would essentially mean that there was no currency on the planet with any stable value. 


Could do it instantaneously with VenMo (as long as there were people in those countries). Would take probably 5 minutes total depending on how quickly the people entered the transaction, no fee. 
I'm not trying to crap on BitCoin. I think it's really great! But misrepresenting it isn't doing anyone any favors. It has disadvantages. It's certainly unstable - if you click the link that I posted it compares it directly to the US Dollar and it is *much much* more volatile. It's not even close.That means that purchasing BitCoins has dangers.
 It's not just like putting money in a bank because my $200 in the bank will be worth $200 next month (maybe $201 with interest). But my $200 of BitCoin might be worth $125, or $300, we don't know.

This robot sounds like it's going to take us to a windowless van.

Should the mods be aware of anything? Anything we need to keep an eye out for?

I think it's unfair to take a post that was downvoted to oblivion and call the 3-4 comments that were there representative of the entire community. It's very likely that next to nobody even saw that post.
