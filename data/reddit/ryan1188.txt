Are you an idiot? Bittrex has to follow AML/KYC. If your doing high volume YES it does matter.
AML/KYC is THE LAW in the USA whether you like it or not. These exchange operators are REQUIRED to KYC.  If they release funds without AML/KYC info they are violating the law of the country they are operating in. Don't like it? Don't use the fucking onramp.
You don't have to agree with it...I don't. But it's fucking reality. Deal with it.

I understand this statement....however....If I market sell $5 billion worth of Bitcoin at current prices and market sell $5 billion of JP Morgan shares are the results not the same?

Obviously you've done something wrong, against the rules, gave them incorrect information, spelled something wrong. Thousands and thousands of people are using them without issue. I'm more inclined to believe you fucked up rather than them.
Doing enhanced verification in the first place would have saved you all this trouble. You know AML/KYC laws exist in your country. There is a BIG difference between basic verification and enhanced verification.

Nobody is forcing anybody to use Bitcoin and in its current state IS NOT suitable for mass adoption. These problems WILL go away as businesses and entrepreneurs make the innovations necessary to utilize the Bitcoin protocol in a way that makes it much more consumer friendly. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:41:00
So? Bitcoins are still accepted as payment through a payment processor. When I go overseas and use my Visa card at a European store do you think they hold my canadian dollars after I'm done paying? No, Visa (the payment processor just like Bitpay or Coinbase) charges me the consumer an exchange rate spread and pays the store in Euros, not Canadian dollars. Those stores indirectly accept ANY currency that Visa trades in.
Do you think that it bothers me knowing stores don't want to hold my Canadian dollars? Nope.
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:22:17
Bitcoin can still be taxed. It doesn't need to be controlled by government to be taxable.
Bitcoin is global, it's not limited to any single country and it doesen't require legal tender status to be successful. It simply doesent need 100% acceptance everywhere yo go to be successful. There are dozens of currencies that are not accepted in the USA but still function.

I'm so tired of watching people completely stumble and mess up golden opportunities to fit within the status quo.
What are you trying to prove? Who are you trying to protect? Because it doesn't really seem like your acting in the best interest of your state if you're stifling innovation with completely ridiculous rules like limiting retained earnings/profits to $US holdings, bonds etc. I'm not even convinced AML and KYC regs are even effective! Just look at the banks that willingly launder money as they stand now! People DO find loopholes and WILL find ways regardless of the regulations you put in place. The only people you are harming are your fellow citizens through destruction of economic freedom and hence growth.
The millennials won't put up with your antiquated and unprogressive regulations, just look at what they are already doing with existing peer to peer technology like bittorrent. They have totally sidestepped regulation in that area and they will continue to sidestep your regulation in the peer to peer money arena as well.

I came to the realization that the Galaxy S4 is by far a superior product to the iPhone 5s after watching my wife use it and using it myself. I love it.
Apple can develop a mobile payment system with Paypal if they wish, it will flop. People will realize Bitcoin with all it's 3rd party developers building on top of the protocol will make a much more desirable product while cutting out the middleman and all the fees associated with it.

How can you imply that Bitpay is even considered a middleman at $30 a month for up to $300,000 a month in transaction volume?
Sorry it's 0.01%.
What kind of "highly desirable" consumer protection do I need when making a purchase from a brick and mortar store? How is it any different than a cash purchase? Why would I need consumer protection for intangible services or products rendered through a reputable party?
I don't understand why you're so adamantly railing against giving merchants and consumers like me another option in my method of making or receiving payment for products and services.
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:13:34
That's not the situation I suggested though. I suggested being smart about your bank deposits, not stupid. Half a million a year in cash bank deposits is just being a fucking moron. Buying gold and silver coins from dealers or on the classifieds for cash in amounts under $2000. Go sell them on eBay for direct bank deposits. Hows the government to know that I didn't indeed inherit these assets when my mother passed away or bought the assets 14 years ago when gold was under $250 an ounce and silver was $5 an ounce? How about online gambling and sports betting with Bitcoin?
There are plenty of money laundering loopholes, it's about being smart and not an idiot about it. Sure it makes it a bit more tricky, big deal. Money laundering rules banks employ are stupid because it punishes those that follow the rules and is not effective enough to warrant the fiscal burden these regulations put on the economy because of paperwork, compliance officers, etc. It drives up the cost of business for very unnecessary reasons.
This person will spend the money in the economy and WILL be taxed. Get rid of the income tax and implement a higher sales taxes then. Taxation should be on consumption not savings and earnings. Let me be clear....I do not condone tax evasion! But if it's such a big deal and causing so many problems then lets fix it already and revamp our taxation laws for the 21st century.
I could give two shits about criminals laundering their money, let them do it. As you know there is a fine balance between security and privacy. The government using income as a way to catch criminal activity is akin to violations of privacy in any other area of the law where reasonable expectation of privacy is expected. This is why people like me love Bitcoin and what it stands for. It's privacy and permission to do whatever I want with my money without the government stepping in and being like mommy or daddy.

You think I've been disingenuous with my statements?
I've given you my stance on consumer protection, I know full well why anyone or myself might want it but it is hardly desirable or ideal to make it mandatory. A VAST majority of the purchases I make in my daily life are trivial and are by no means high risk. I can't remember the last time anyone tried to scam me or refuse a refund for valid reasons.

Who do you put in charge of mediation and dispute resolution for Bitcoin? If you've ever sold anything on eBay as a seller you will know how easy it is for scammers to completely rip you off as a merchant and file chargebacks or claim non receipt of items. Paypal is infamous for siding with customers in situations where the buyer is the one committing the fraud.
How is this a good addition to the Bitcoin network? The only benefit it provides is better consumer adoption. It's just another thing to become corrupted. Refrain from sending Bitcoin to untrusted parties or if you do, then take responsibility for your own cavalier actions like an adult if anything should go wrong.

Correct me if I'm wrong but an exchange does not necessarily have to accept deposits for repayment. If Bitcoin is not defined as money but a commodity then I can sell my Bitcoins on the exchange without this law applying.
Could an exchange not make a loophole in where they can require separate accounts for different functions? For example one account for the sole purpose of accepting non-refundable deposits for purchase of Bitcoins (seeing how Bitcoin is so widely said not to be money) and then require you to make a different account that can only be used to sell Bitcoins ("not money") for well....money while still allowing bitcoin withdrawals as well....it's a commodity.
Does this not fall under barter and not banking?

It doesn't harm Blockchain, just like it doesn't harm any other bitcoin company because none of them are aloud to use bitcoin wallets. Those that want to use Bitcoin wallets will go android. So no it won't hamper adoption because people won't hesitate to switch phones just like the wife and I did. If people aren't willing to change phones to use Bitcoin and reap its benefits then Bitcoin isn't for that person. You can't convince everyone to use Bitcoin so early in its life, some people are blinded by headlines and don't see its benefits.

Doesn't Bitpay charge 0% for $30 a month? A middleman isn't a big deal, as long as they aren't costing your business model money. Bitcoin will be used predominantly as an online currency and as such it will have it's own economy where people can earn it and use it without ever having to exchange it back into the currency you use in your country. Bitcoin, just like any other currency will have a spread when converting it into another currency.

Keynesian economics is used because it works. That doesn't mean it's ideal. Look at the all the problems that exist with this current system, to remain complacent and accept it for what it is in my mind is unacceptable.
I don't expect Bitcoin to replace entire economies but I do see it as a complementary tool to participating fully in the current system. The current system fosters vast income inequality because of the way money is created/inflated and distributed. The rich get richer is literally applicable to the current system because of the way capitalism functions with this monetary system. I'm not against capitalism but I am against the rigging of the system by the rich to get richer.

The government can't force you to sell someone a product for something you don't desire. If I don't wish to sell an item for US dollars I don't have to. Period. It's the law. If someone doesn't agree to pay me in Bitcoin for a product I hold as a business owner I have NO OBLIGATION to sell it to them.
You really don't understand what I'm even trying to tell you....If you go into a store to purchase something they CAN demand you pay in Bitcoin or not allow you to leave the store with the item. They DO NOT have to accept USD for payment unless a debt is owed.
If you go to a restaurant and place an order and they demand you pay in Bitcoin, YOU DON'T have to pay in Bitcoin, you are legally entitled to pay in USD as it is legal tender EVEN if the menu is priced in BTC. However the restaurant can require you to prepay for food in Bitcoin prior to placing your order and only accept Bitcoin as payment or refuse service.
It's as simple as that....Any business can accept Bitcoin as sole payment for items or services they provide, however if they find himself in a situation where they are owed money they have NO SAY in how the debtor pays them back. The creditor legally has to accept USD for the debt owed.
THAT IS ALL LEGAL TENDER MEANS.
It's all right here simple and plain as day, one of many resources you can choose to ignore because you clearly have something else to prove other than the truth.
I'm happy to change my mind if you can prove me wrong.

Read it again.
"United States coins and currency are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues."
Better yet pull out one of your american bills and read the text in the top left "This note is legal tender for all DEBTS, public and private."
If you have no debt, then it doesn't matter what you pay, or how, or in what denomination. If you go to a store and pick up an apple and set it on the check-out counter, you are not in debt. You've simply moved someone else's apple from one place to another. You cannot leave with that apple without paying for it, however; that would be stealing. You have no obligation to take that apple, and thus no obligation to pay for it. You can walk away. Likewise, the store has no obligation to accept payment from you in any particular form.
If you have a debt on the other hand, federal reserve notes and U.S. coins are legal tender for all debts, public and private. You can tend coin and federal reserve notes, and a creditor is obliged to accept it. If you stole the apple, the state could charge you with a crime. You could land in jail, and the store would be fully within its rights to sue you in civil court for damages. The judge would, provided there was adequate evidence, find in favor of the store, and issue a judgement, thereby affirming a debt. You may then pay it in legal tender, including federal reserve notes and U.S. coin.
Stores don't have to set a price in their items in dollars, they can set the terms of the sale in barter i.e. Bitcoin only. Do you honestly think you as a person can walk into a business and demand them to sell you an item if it doesn't even have a dollar price on it? Come on, use some common sense. There are plenty of Bitcoin businesses out there already that only do business in Bitcoin, what are you going to do to force them to take your fiat? They are operating within the law.
Moral of the story: Follow the law and pay for apple before leaving, store decides how you pay. Break law to steal apple and get sued by store, then you may pay in legal tender.
You are like so many other people that misunderstand what legal tender even means, I'm just trying to inform you that your statement of "There's absolutely no point to Bitcoin when everyone still has to accept fiat by law" is incorrect, why do you take offence to this?

The people who traded at Mt. Gox had it coming to them, so does anyone else who keeps their wallets online in e-wallets or exchanges. The playing field is completely littered with scammers and fraud because the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin is still in it's infancy.
I've owned a visa card for the last 6 years of my life and have never had to have a charge reversed. I personally like the idea that chargebacks or dispute is an available action for me but that doesn't mean I start making stupid purchases with shady businesses or individuals over the internet and just *hope* I don't get scammed. I take responsibility for my own actions and I don't expect someone to take on my risk because I'm careless.
I'd much rather pay 3% less for transactions than being forced to pay for insurance on every single god damn transaction.

Ones more heavily influenced by government policy and the other a lack thereof. They will function and respond differently under different circumstances. You don't need to go into depth about this to understand it. One has a limited circulation and the market sets it's own interest rates while the other one is controlled by governing bodies.
Just look at the limitations New York is trying to pit in place with the BitLicense regulations! It specifically states that Bitcoin companies are only allowed to invest retained earnings and profits into the existing monetary system that is the US dollar via federal bonds, state bonds or MM funds. They ARE NOT permitted to invest in Bitcoin directly by holding it or indirectly. How is this NOT protecting the status quo and current system in place? Nobody is forcing anyone to use this currency, don't like it, don't use it.

Keynesian is garbage and so is Reagan's shit trickle down theory. By the time that money trickles down to the bottom it's worth less than it was when it was first issued. The full economic benefit only reaches the first few recipients before the economy adjusts to the increase in money supply and hence inflation occurs.
Printing money to solve lack of spending in an economy is moronic. Having people spend money today because they fear it will be worth less in the future is great for stimulating growth in an economy but why is that seen as the only way to have a functioning economy?
People don't save solely to prepare, people save to make a purchase so they don't have to buy it on credit. Savings is not bad, it encourages responsible spending and living within your means and if your economy can't handle people saving money then they system IS BROKEN and isn't robust enough. It needs change.
An economy that is purely deflationary would be bad no doubt....but to have a savings vehicle immune from criminal inflationary tactics and encourages you to only spend when necessary is a good addition to the current shithole economies around the world that encourage tremendous waste just for the sake of "growth" or some patriotic duty to spend money money. But that's not what it is. The US government will never pay off their accumulated debt, it will keep growing and they will keep printing money because this inflationary system based on a fractional reserve system is broken and allows countries to inflate their way out of debt at the expense of it's citizens via it's current monetary system. This will only last as long as countries keep their debt servicing levels within manageable ranges.
You know the type of person I hate more than anyone else? The type that can't pay their bills and live beyond their means. You CAN'T spend money you DON'T have to get an economy to jump back! You're just kicking the can down the road.

You're right, Apple heavily censor and control users experience with their products by dictating what they can or can't do on their products. I don't blame them for wanting to try and project their brand image in a way they want to. It's going to bite them in the ass though as people like myself may be happy with the way Apple manages a particular aspect of their business but is very unhappy with the other parts.

But the current credit card system is hardly ideal. An electronics store owner would prefer you pay with cash on a $9000 purchase of a new TV, sound system etc. than by credit card. If your willing to pay cash chances are the business owner would be willing to knock off a couple hundred bucks off your purchase, and thats more money in your pocket as a consumer and more money in his pocket as a business owner. He doesn't have to give you a full 3% discount, hell he could give you 2% and keep the 1% extra for himself and make more money on the sale.
This option is available and it's akin to using Bitcoin, albeit in it's current form not user friendly. It has potential to save a lot of people a lot of money and cut out unnecessary middlemen.

"My wallet is encrypted, that's good enough"
"I'm not careless on the internet, I won't get a keylogger or someone won't hack me"
"My house won't burn down, I won't lose my private keys/wallet"
I bought a one time payment insurance policy and I don't regret it. I originally thought I was just buying a security device for my bitcoin but in reality it was a heck of a wallet upgrade from bitcoin core.

Bitcoin really is digital gold........and it's just plain better than gold. Non-confiscatable if handled properly.
Can be moved cross borders undetected.
A shelter from the inflation of the worlds fiat moneys.
Permissionless transfer of money.
There is just so much more than this and the implications are mind blowing. Bitcoin is going to be absolutely massive, I have no doubt in my mind bitcoin will hit 100k at some point in the future. I'd venture to say 100k in 3-5 years would not be farfetched.

I'd imagine your account was flagged based on an assortment of indicators.

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:05:35
Do you understand how bitcoin works? Do you know what the proof of work algorithm in conjunction with a blockchain opens up the possibilities to? The societal implications of money being put back into the hands and power of the people? Bitcoin can't be confiscated, can't be censored. Bitcoins store of value is in its proof of work in combination with THEE blockchain. Bitcoin doesn't need intrinsic value per say to be considered a store of value. Money is just an agreed upon medium to communicate transfer of value. Bitcoin is not something you just understand in a day and then come to a conclusion on, it takes weeks and weeks......MONTHS to understand it's inner workings and to come to the realization that it is world changing, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it.
I'd recommend watching some of Andreas Antonopoulos talks.
If there is one thing in life I'd recommend....I'd recommend you allocate at least a few dozen hours learning as much as you can about bitcoin to come to your own informed decision. To be quite frank....you won't get anywhere by listening to mainstream media news clips. You really need to understand this stuff to fully appreciate its beauty.

Stop using wallets that don't let you set custom fees. Depending on the state of the mempool usually 30 satoshis a byte is enough to have your transaction go throuh within 6 blocks.

Welcome to the early days of the internet (read bitcoin) it's not user friendly. Bitcoin in it's current state is not designed for micro transactions, it's just not doable in its current state. You are literally competing with other people to get into the next block. Increasing the block size will not fix this problem alone, as soon as more capacity is available, IT WILL BE USED. Bitcoin will be playing catch-up just like the internet has played catchup with bandwidth speeds.

How familiar are you with Bitcoin and its technical workings? Is it something you've only just come across and heard of in mainstream media? I keep getting this feeling that you're coming straight from mainstream investing and trying to fit it into existing models and expectations. I'm not being sensationalist when I say Bitcoin is unlike anything the world has ever seen before. Bitcoin disintermediates banks and has far reaching implications that are impossible to fully predict. It may be cliche at this point to say Bitcoin is going to do to finance like the internet did to media, but it's the truth.
I hear you....I'm not going to deny that Bitcoin seems a bit exuberant at this point. Heck after this run up I really would not be surprised to have a prolonged 1 year pullback. On the other hand, it's only JUST started to go mainstream and has a very promising long term future.

It's a flat satoshi per byte fee based on how many inputs you have. Sending 50 cents or 50 million dollars does not make a difference for the fee. Transaction size in BYTES is what determines what fee you will pay. The more inputs the larger the transaction size IN BYTES.

You had a TON of inputs. Basically you had a ton of small deposits sent to a single address. Now you want to send all those small deposits to a single address, so you need to sign for each input.
Also...you paid 234 satoshis per byte as a transaction fee when currently a 35 satoshi per byte fee would have done just fine and resulted in your transaction most probably going through within the next few blocks.

Some exchanges offer auto-sell addresses. When depositing Bitcoin to these addresses the exchange will immediately execute a market sell order and credit your account. Doesn't really solve the problem but perhaps when your holding fiat on an exchange the laws change a bit. Decentralized exchanges are needed, but I don't really think that is possible when interacting/trading for traditional fiat currencies.

Your absolutely correct. But their intentions don't justify an invisible tax via inflation. Encouraging people to go into debt and spend money they don't have isn't exactly good for the economy in the long term. Your literally borrowing against your own future productivity.

Permissionless, borderless and censorship resistant. These are features for a reason, they are not bugs. If you can't see why then I don't know what to tell you except to look and think harder.

I don't know what to tell you.....If you think you are a better developer and are capable of better then go build something yourself and see if people will follow you.

Go trade your BTC for some shit altcoins with close to non existent dev teams and see how far it will go.
Bitcoin is not a stock, it's not a company. Results are not expected every quarter. Bitcoin will fail to scale GRACEFULLY just like the internet has failed to scale GRACEFULLY for the past 30+ years.

It is nowhere near the size of national currencies who's volitility as you may or may not know is extremely low.

Tons of 0-5 satoshis/byte transactions have gone through over the past 24 hours. 
The light blue at the bottom are accumulated 0-5 satoshi/byte transactions. You can see that at every block produced some of those transactions are being included in those blocks.
But I do wonder about this myself. I thought I had read somewhere here that some pools/miners are voluntarily including a % of low fee transactions in their blocks. I don't know if this had any truth to it or what......I do recall at one point bitcoin transactions prioritization also took into account "bitcoin days destroyed". But I believe that was removed or changed.
Can anyone shed some light on this?

Once coinbase sends your bitcoin to the address you have provided them....it's yours and can't be taken from you unless you compromise the security of the private keys on your Trezor. The only way that happens is if you expose the 24 word seed that is generated once you set up your Trezor. That 24 word seed is essentially your private keys to all the addresses that will be generated by your Trezor wallet.
Coinbase will send you your bitcoins via a bitcoin transaction to a new address that you specify as they are a custodian of your bitcoins. They won't actually "copy" ~~your~~ private keys to you, that's not how most (like....99%) bitcoins are transferred. Private keys really are not meant to be exchanged, they are only there for backup/restore purposes.

If there are less miners (less hashrate) then the difficulty will lower accordingly to keep a steady average of a block per 10 minutes. The system will adjust the difficulty so that the hash rate present will be sufficient to generate a block every 10 minutes. (On average)
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:05:30
'twas a shit company from the start. no saving that dumpster fire. It's still shit to this day.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:59:04
Yes and no. A sudden massive decrease in hashing power (miners) by say %50 would result in blocks being found every 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes on average. But this would only last until the next difficulty adjustment which happens every 2016 blocks. The difficulty is adjusted so that the total network hashrate provided by the miners results in blocks being found every 10 minutes on average.
I'm sure there are a whole bunch of dynamic things that would happens this point. But one I can think of is the mempool would get quite large and a backlog of transactions would pile up. This would drive up fees for using the network but as a result incentivises mining as it becomes more profitable thus bringing more hashing power. It's a self balancing mechanism.

Spending Bitcoin puts downwards pressure on the market the moment the receiver is looking to liquidate it into any other currency.

Look at the correlation between bitcoin price action and the mempool. What happened with bitcoins price between October 12th to October 14th? Not rocket science. People are looking to move bitcoin to and from addresses....liquidity is required when there are price moves like this. To and from exchanges.....etc.etc.

The device allows yo to retain your keys using bip39 mnemonic code. More specically, 24 unique words with the ability to add a passphrase on top. From this you can derive the private keys to your coins on one or multiple addresses derived from these 24 words. This is known as a hierarchical deterministic wallet.
 
You can then store your 24 words (in a specific order) in a safe and fireproof manner. If you lose the trezor or it is destroyed you can recover the private keys to your addresses using these 24 words.

Your impatience is astounding. Scaling systems, especially systems with billions of dollars in value takes time. it takes peer reviewed code and proper implementation. We need solutions that will scale multiplicatively. Second layer solutions are in the works.....Segwit...lightning network.....fun stuff. You can't rush this stuff.
Segwit has already increased the effective block size. 
Go to the link...click on "since activation". Scroll down to block size.....notice how the block size has been increasing beyond 1,000,000 bytes? Segwit address adoption has only hit 14% and we are already making progress. Now in the future...if decided...a hard fork solution (last resort) like increasing the block size can be implemented and this will work MANIPULATIVELY with Segwit.
You don't solve these problems by going nuclear as the first move. That's stupid and poor planning. You want to optimize the current system by making the least disruptive changes possible, then move forward from there.

Exactly. The Trezor uses something called BIP39 mnemonic code. The 24 word seed is....well....a seed for a a hierarchical deterministic wallet. All the addressees(and their private keys) it will ever generate can be derived from that 24 word seed.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:51:42
The forked coin is only worth what other people are willing to pay for it. If I forked bitcoin into a shitcoin and my brother buys a shitcoin for $20 does that mean my coin has a $330,000,000 "market cap"?
Market cap is a metric and has its uses but really is not all that useful. If you tried to liquidate 1,000,000 bitcoins you would not receive $5700 each for them, the market would tank.

If you're paying $5 per transaction then your using the wrong wallet. Set your own custom fee after you take a look at the mempool.
That should give you a good idea what you can get away with paying in terms of satoshis per byte as a fee. If we hit an unlucky patch where no block is found for 40+ min then fees are going to go up as more and more people want to be included in the next block and a backlog of transactions build up known as the mempool. Transactions are skimmed off the top.....rinse and repeat every block. Right now you can get away with paying 15 satoshis a byte....and you can pretty much say your getting in the next block.
At an average transaction size of lets say 400 bytes...thats a fee of 0.00006BTC or about 33 cents. This is obviously still to high of a fee for smaller everyday purchases but work is being done to improve this.
This is not something you just improve by implementing larger blocks. Linear scaling is not the ideal solution at this point in time.

Tell that to wikileaks.......or any other organization or person who is snuffed out because they don't fit into visas, mastercards or any banks mould of worthiness to be bankable.
Frozen funds......confiscated funds...siezed funds by government. All avoidable with bitcoin if proper measures are taken. Your money can't be siezed....and nobody can prevent you from transfering your money wherever the fuck you please. Immutable by design. No busy bodies are capable of telling you what you can or can't do with your own fucking money when you use bitcoin.
Bitcoin in it's current form really isn't for day to day purchases. Why use bitcoin when you can use credit cards with purchase protections and reward programs. You're right. But that's not bitcoin's value proposition.
Bitcoin is an exit from the existing monetary system. Can it coexist with the current monetary system? Sure. But it wasn't designed to replace it. Will there be legal problems ahead? Probably. But who's going to stop it? Sure the govenment can choke the on/offramps of bitcoin by heavily regulating exchanges....but bitcoin transactions can't be stopped or regulated.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:12:27
If you have a trezor then you own and control your keys and you will have access to coins on both chains once the split happens. The 24 word seed and passphrase (not pin) is a BIP 39 mnemonic code for generating deterministic private keys.
Trezor I'm sure will assist you in splitting your coins but you might have to wait a bit after the split (a good idea anyways)
You can always take your BIP 39,  24 word seed and take it to another wallet that supports it as well.

Except bitcoin isn't just a currency....It's a payment platform. I'd actually venture to say bitcoin is more of a payment platform than a currency. It's a hybrid none the less. You still haven't explained what you're getting at and what difference it would ever make.
If someone comes from canada and uses their credit card inside the USA to make a purchase the company accepts credit cards for payments, that's the bottom line. They don't care what country you are from or what currency you are paying with because the payment processor takes care of that.
Why would this company want to hold such a volatile currency and expose itself to unnecessary risk? This isn't a bad thing for bitcoin. Exchanges are necessary for any currency.

It shows he hasn't done his research and even looked at the basics, which calls into question his understanding of the protocol Bitcoin is. If he can't be bothered to even format it properly then why should we believe he even bothered to research its functions.
Its kind of like......a tech website doing a piece on the iPhone except in their writings they refer to it as IPhone or Iphone or the iMacs operating system as IOS or ios instead of iOS.
Silly isn't it? An expert on said subject not knowing the basic spelling of the product/technology they claim to know everything about.

Paypal can go eat a dick. I'm done with their bullshit. Their dispute department sides with the customer 75% of the time even if the customer is at fault. Their fees are rediculous and I will never use them as a method for accepting payment again. In other news...I have gold and silver I'd like to sell outside of ebay. Any trustworthy bitcoin alternatives yet?

What I'm getting at is people are not going to want to gamble for your bowls. Why are you suggesting 5 people each pitch in 0.1 BTC and then only one person gets the bowl? It also just makes your offer look like a scam.
Why not just price them out individually.....

Well that sucks, you should have never ordered when they had such a huge backlog. If you ordered EARLY like I did your miner would have paid for itself 4x over like mine.

Fucking brilliant.
Except companies won't use the mail system to deliver their bills buddy. ;) You must only need to log onto your account on their website and get the QR code directly off their site from "your account" page.
Not as much room for rampant mail fraud and fake bills etc.

Interesting read, some valid points are brought up. I like to see someone debate this point of view.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:48:36
I stopped reading and laughed when you made this STUPID comparison.
"Bitcoin is essentially perceived to be 1000x better as a means of storing value than one United States dollar."
Bitcoins value has nothing to do with it being "better" at storing value than a USD....There are only a little over 12 million bitcoins in circulation. how many USD are in circulation? A lot more.
Please never make such a shitty comparison again.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:14:24
But it's not "realistically feasible" to counterfeit bitcoins. I think you're misunderstanding that you can NEVER have more than 21,000,000 bitcoins in circulation. You can have people that OWE more than what exists and by default this means the creditor is shit out of luck when it comes to getting their bitcoins back. Of course this could exist to an extent but I think it would result in the bitcoin value rising because of people seeking out bitcoins to repay debts. You can't have a market that has 40,000,000 bitcoins worth of "credit owed" without creditors going bankrupt for imprudent "banking" measures with this currency system.

How do you even short a bitcoin? I don't understand. It's not like a traditional stock.
How would it work?

You missed the entire point of his glaring mistakes and what it implies to his knowledge on the subject.
Look how many times he changes the formatting and doesn't seem to get it right.
Shouldn't someone who's been researching this subject been aware of it's proper spelling on day one? It's not the "grammar mistake" we're arguing. It's his complete choice of ignorance on the subject as it shows he hasn't even dove into bitcoin and studied it into detail.
Picture yourself on a tech guru site that specializes in Apple products (kinda like how Paul Krugman specializes in economics) writing articles and they constantly fuck up the technologies and product spelling like iPhone, iMac and iOS to show IPhone, Iphone, IMac, Imac, IOS, Ios etc.
Looks like they haven't done even their basic homework eh?
Look at one of many BASIC principles of Bitcoin he gets DEAD WRONG!
*"So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it’s as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley."*
NOT TRUE. Transactions once validated, are permanently recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain.
How does he get something as BASIC as that DEAD WRONG? Easy he hasn't done his research. He's not an idiot, he's just not bothered to research the details of Bitcoin. It's not about the fucking spelling.

So you don't think it's an issue that Paul Krugman hasn't done research on Bitcoin? Because that's what it implies.
Look at some of his statements. It shows a GLARING misunderstanding of how bitcoin works and the COMPLETE lack of effort on his part to research the details of Bitcoin.
*"So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it’s as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley."*
NOT TRUE. Transactions once validated, are permanently recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain.
There are many more examples of his complete ignorance. It's like he is unable to wrap his head around the simple fact that Bitcoin functions without the intermediation of a central authority like a bank or government.
This is of course what he specializes in...NOT BITCOIN.

Probably litecoin
google "litecoin calculator"
Radeon 7950s hash at about 650-730 KH/s each
So if we assume 4 x 690 KH/s = 2760 KH/s and plunk that into a calculator online he is making about $18 a day (before electricity cost) at the current litecoin price. He's spending anywhere between $2-$6/day in electricity (1.5kw/hour x 24 hours a day) depending on what his rate it.

Why do you equate caplocks with shouting? I mean who came out and declared this as "law" of the internet that caplocks is = to shouting?
I get the annoyance, but if anything you should not equate it to shouting because typing in caplocks has NOTHING to do with acoustics at all.
If anything it should be a judge of someones frustration.

I agree with you to a point but wouldn't a price drop naturally equalize to a price at which people are willing to pay seeing how possession of a bitcoin is so desirable not a "collapse" just a correction?

You think 210 trillion units won't be sufficient?
As an example....a $5 trillion bitcoin market cap divided by 21 million units will get you $238,095 per bitcoin. This is an example remember.....
In this example a satoshi unit is worth $0.0023 i.e. a fifth of a cent.
