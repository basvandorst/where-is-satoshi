I don't get why people feel the need to come into the sub and feel all superior by shitting on bitcoin and people who have it.
Yes, most of us here who have bought bitcoin understand that it could go up to $30k tomorrow or it could drop down to $3k tomorrow. No one has ever advocated for people to blindly invest in bitcoin. I'm long on bitcoin. It goes up, great. It goes down, I've invested what I'm willing to lose, like I would any other stock. I don't have my 401k or life savings in bitcoin. That being said, I'm not necessarily ready to buy anymore bitcoin.

Pretty sure Robinhood requires some sort of address verification right? I signed up for it long ago, but since they deal with stock first and foremost, I'd imagine it isn't as simple as a switch of a VPN.

Just a shout out to everyone who HODL'd and continues to do so. Too many people I know panicked when it crashed. They bought in at price points between 11k and 15k and panic sold yesterday at like 12k.
Some still have a bit of their portfolio left.
Yeah, it looked bad. I get it, everyone has their own risk tolerance and if you need to sell, you need to sell. But it was a bad day for cryptos across the board. Bitcoin is weathering the BCH bullshit with coinbase and gdax. Overall in this month, we're still up 5k from hitting the 10k mark. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. It's gonna go up, it's gonna go down.
You haven't actually lost until you sell at a lower price than you bought at.
Sorry for the mini rant yall. This is a long term thing. It's bound to fluctuate up and down.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:17
Go to your dashboard and under the recent activity section, click on the transaction. It should say the fee, subtotal, and total.
If it says $5 for fee, $525 for subtotal, but $550 for total, then something got fucked. But if the numbers add up, then...the numbers add up.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:24
You can. Depends on your risk tolerance. You sell at 20k, make money.
You can let it hit 20k, and maybe it'll rally to 21k or higher. If that happens, you'll be glad you didn't sell at 20k.
You can let it hit 20k, maybe it'll correct and dip down to 18k. But if you think about it, you still made close to 100% of your money back.
My personal opinion is let it hit 20k, don't panic sell. See where it goes. If it starts plummeting, then assess your tolerance and sell at 18k or whatever. The goal is to sell at a gain. You have a long way down from 20k to your initial price at 9.7k.

I mean you make sarcastic quips about "wasting money on pot or just incompetent". And talking about how you managed to do it.
Gonna need some numbers here dude.
Saving 20k a year, what's cost of living in your 3rd world country? Did you/do you have any other financial support (family money to support you)? What is considered "3rd world pay" to you or your country?
Before you start preaching "hey if I can do it everyone else should be able to, they're just bad at managing money", realize that 20k a year is 1667 USD per month. For some, that's their entire month's rent. Or mortgage payment. Then there's the actual cost of living - food, transportation, other bills.

Yeah this is the difference between coinbase and gdax.
Coinbase I can buy at today's price and it'll arrive a week later as the money gets transferred. GDAX requires me to have cash in my account before I can buy. Far lower fees on GDAX, but you just need to maintain that cash balance.

Sorry I might have worded it different, it's me trying to remember exactly what he said. But I did bring up gold and stuff. Gold is valuable for what you mentioned, yes. But it's not a currency. I brought gold up too and likened it to bitcoin. And he responded by saying gold and silver are commodities, not a currency.
I'll talk to him tomorrow more in detail, I'm definitely leaving out some details I think lol. But he's a smart guy and I enjoy talking to him about things like this, I just want to have the right understanding personally.

Coinbase move to gdax (same company). gdax to your wallet. No fees.

$2000 at once? Or over time. They have limits for single transactions until you verify.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:53:06
Agreed, I think there's going to be a bit of a dip when people sell at $10k. *But*, I think with the appeal of bitcoin, more people are going to buy at that dip, so it'll probably be a short lived dip. Price will rise once again, I predict at a slower pace though.
Wonder what's going on in the rest of the world to fuel demand in other nations.

Leaning toward TREZOR right now for no reason at all lol it just has more reviews on Amazon.
Also, are there any recommended combinations where I can have a software wallet on my iPhone as well as a hardware wallet? Or does this sort of thing not exist...
Finally, I purchased some BTC on Coinbase about a week ago. Where would I find out how to transfer it to a hard/software wallet of mine?
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:13
You have limits on how much you can buy/sell before you have to verify ID. My friends have bought a few hundred USD of bitcoin using coinbase without verifying. I think the limit is 450$ on credit card before verification? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:20:16
Nah, I'm fairly certain US holidays played some role. It got a lot more people *looking* at bitcoin. Some people probably bought in around the Thanksgiving holiday, some people probably decided to finally take the plunge and buy in today.
While that won't single handedly drive price up, I believe it gave it enough of a boost for more people to buy in. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:08:26
If you are limited on your funds for bitcoin, for whatever reason, then you would obviously want to maximize how much you can purchase - you'd buy at the dip.

I second this. From what I've seen, it's slightly higher rates (right?), but well suited for these larger transactions.

Congrats on everyone watching gdax and coinbase :) We're here at $10k, but it's just the beginning!
gdax has been teasing me at 9999.99 and 10,000.00. It's been going back and forth between the two. But boy is it nice to see all the trade history activity at a nice even 10,000.00!
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:38:27
Perfect! Thank you, glad to know that this eliminates transaction fees altogether. And good to know about the phone and hardware wallets being separate. I'm using bitcoin to invest mainly, so I don't anticipate on spending. But if that need arises in the future, it's good to know that I can just move bitcoins from my hardware wallet to phone!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:24:50
I mean I made a bit of money doing this today, so I guess.
I have a small sum of cash on gdax for immediate transactions. Bought when it was at 9300, placed a limit order to sell at 9700 because why the hell not lol. But long term, I'm not depending on this strategy. This was like 90% for shits and giggles, 10% to make a bit of money (granted it's not much).
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:56:34
The better way to think of it is you're spending $550 on coinbase.
Of that $550 amount, $531 went to BTC, the remainder went to coinbase fees. If you're on a computer and you look at the right panel, it explains it. 
It'll show exactly how much of your payment is going to BTC and how much is going to the coinbase fee, and the total shown should be $550.

Or we follow good investment practices and keep our portfolios diversified. Bitcoin has gone from 8k to 10k in a week, but it also went from 7.9k to 5.5k in a week. I believe in bitcoin and I believe it'll keep rising. But to tell someone to sell all their other investments and place it solely in bitcoin is not a smart strategy. Never risk more than you're willing to lose. I'm not sure how many people are going to risk their entire portfolio.
I mean, at the end of the day, everyone understands their own risk better than anyone else on the internet. If someone is fine accepting risk and placing all their bets on bitcoin, more power to ya. It's on the constant rise, and I wouldn't blame you. But at the end of the day, nothing trumps good investing practices. Diversify.

I dunno man hard to avoid just selling to cut the losses
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:50:40
Likely fees factored in, which is how they stay operating. That's a downside of something user friendly and simple like coinbase. Makes it very easy to use, but also collects a fee.
Whereas some other places (not sure which, I'm new too) are more "raw" and there's no fee. There's no hand holding or super easy "click here to buy/sell" or something like that. 
With coinbase, I never assume bitcoin price is what I will buy at. Always factor in a bit more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:38:36
Coinbase and gdax are the same company, so I have no reason to believe one is more secure than the other - it's the same login and same 2FA. Transfers are instant between the two, whether it's USD balance or BTC or some other crypto.
Coinbase is instant buy vs. gdax requiring you to have funds in the account.
With coinbase, if you have a bank account attached, you can buy bitcoin at the current price, say 9900$ (plus fees). It'll take a few days for the bitcoin to arrive in your wallet and for it to be taken from your bank, but you've already technically "bought" it at 9900+fees. That means if tomorrow, it's 11k, you still bought however much bitcoin at the 9900+fees price.
Whereas with gdax, if you deposit funds via bank account, it'll take 4 days for the money to arrive. *Then* you can purchase btc. So take the example of 9900+fees. 4 days later when the deposit arrives, it could be at 14k.
That's my perception of buying on the two at least...I could be wrong about gdax, but nothing I've seen so far indicates otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:13:53
Unreal hype right now. It broke the 10k barrier and has just kept going up. Once it broke 10k, people probably thought it'd be time to jump on it. Then it proceeded to tease 11k and broke 11k.
Price jumps: people getting in on the hype
Price drops: people have made a few hundred and now want out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:42:08
Yeah, coinbase has like a 4% fee for credit card transactions, or something like that. The best regular cash back card I'm aware of would be Citi's Double Cash at 2%. Shit, coinbase would have to be coded as like gas or groceries for me to be able to hit &gt;4% cash back on any credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:37:21
Gotcha, thanks! I'm using this to diversify my investments, so it looks like I won't need a phone wallet...don't anticipate spending bitcoin. If the need arises in the future, I'll consider it, but looks like I don't need it now!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:00
God damn I’ve been so excited and hyped. Trying to purchase a bit more significant amount of Bitcoin now at once instead of parts at a time. Except for whatever reason I’m hesitating this time. 
Phew. Thought 10k would be a psychological barrier and we’d be in for an almost immediate correction with sell offs. But it’s just gone up more. But if I’m long Bitcoin who cares if it dips tomorrow right? 
Lol fuck sorry for the rant y’all. Let’s do this. I’m risking what I’m prepared to lose and I’m gonna hodl 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:11
Unrealized loss! You haven't lost anything yet, technically :) You only lose when you sell below what you paid. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:40:12
Typically a beginner will start with a third party, like Coinbase. You buy bitcoin through the third party. There will be some fees and it likely won't be at the current rate (e.g., 1 BTC = 8000 USD, you buy at 1 BTC = 8035 USD or something).
Once you buy the bitcoins, it's "yours", but you don't actually hold it - Coinbase, or whatever third party, has the actual bitcoin. That's when you transfer it to your own wallet (paper, hardware, software).
tl;dr: third party helps you buy bitcoin, but you don't have the bitcoin until you transfer it to a wallet in your control.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:54:43
I believe it's Accounts -&gt; BTC Wallet -&gt; Send
Then enter your mobile wallet address.
If you do it directly through Coinbase, you'll incur some fees, I believe. Best route is to log into gdax (they're the same as Coinbase). Move your bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to gdax, then from gdax to your mobile wallet. No fees that way.
To do that, log into gdax. Left column, deposit -&gt; Coinbase account -&gt; enter amount and deposit funds.
Once the bitcoins are transferred to gdax, go withdraw -&gt; BTC address -&gt; enter amount and address, probably verify using MFA, and withdraw funds.
It'll take a while for the bitcoins to transfer over, but it'll happen if you entered everything correctly - depends on network.
FWIW, this is the process I use. If anyone has better steps, please feel free to comment. It's worked for me so far.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:51:34
Coinbase user here. Is the best route to hardware wallet to go:
coinbase -&gt; gdax -&gt; hardware wallet
Is that the correct sequence to minimize fees?
Also, if I want a wallet on my phone and a hardware wallet, is there a way for them to "share"? Or do I end up with two wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:50:34
Coinbase has a fee for purchasing, and has a fee to transfer to a wallet, so yes, I think it's normal for some sites.
There are also others that can help avoid the second fee. My experience so far has been Coinbase -&gt; gdax -&gt; wallet. You only pay the fee when buying btc through Coinbase. Transfers do not have fees if you go that route.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:57:10

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:52
Sure, that's fine if you choose to believe that and if you have reasons for backing it up.
Personally, I believe in diversification. It's great that you believe in bitcoin so strongly. I believe in it strongly as well. Doesn't mean I'm going to put everything in it. If shit hits the fan, I still have other investments in my portfolio.
I go with the old saying, don't place all your eggs in one basket.
And I disagree that you need "massive wealth" to succeed in stocks. A majority of my portfolio has gone up (not all, I've made some poor choices before). I call those gains a success. Am I raking in hundreds of thousands? No, but I've still made money - I've beat the measly 0.8% interest my bank offers me.
Again, I'm glad you're so confident in bitcoin. But nothing has shown me that no diversification is better than some diversification. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:46:26
Leaving it on Coinbase is them essentially giving you an IOU for the 1/10 BTC you just bought. Technically you paid for it, but you don't have it in your hands. They're holding it for you though - it's in your name.
If Coinbase goes belly up tomorrow, that IOU is worthless and your 1/10 BTC is gone, because you never really had it in your hands.
I don't know if "immediately" is necessary, but generally it's a good practice to move your bitcoins to a wallet *you* control and have access to. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:33

@_date: 2018-02-21 06:35:13
They're one and the same. Just be logged into coinbase and visit gdax and I think it'll ask you to sign in, or it'll pull straight from your coinbase credentials.
Either way, they're the same company, so your account is shared on both. So you can instantly move your bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to your gdax balance and vice versa, because it's the same platform. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:44:15
As I was getting into crypto, it seems like each exchange had a slew of positive and negative reviews. But ultimately, Coinbase was the easiest way in. I've always recommended Coinbase to my friends who want to get into bitcoin.
The way I see it is like this. You pay a bit more, sure, you also make less when you sell. But for a beginner, I see that as the "cost" of easing into crypto. To be fair, I haven't looked at other exchanges, but Coinbase was the easiest to add my credit card to (funded with credit card at first, figured it was the most pain-free way to start) and start purchasing. As I got into it, I transitioned to gdax.
They've made mistakes, sure. But I enjoy using gdax and I feel confident in using the platform.
Granted, I'm not making tens of thousands of dollars worth of purchases. But I stand by the fact that Coinbase is great for beginners/amateurs.
