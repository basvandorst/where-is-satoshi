Hmm... I think the peercoin people actually encourage Pi nodes. Peercoin being a bitcoin core fork, has bitcoin core just grown out of Pi dimensions since the fork?

I think most people know that facts are true. So let's rephrase the question to:
Why exactly is that true?
And I'll add to that: How can you be so sure about something that will or will not happen in the future? As far as I know, crystal balls and time machines are not invented yet.

That is simply not something a package maintainer should implement. And if he does, because he feels it is a relevant change, he should send the change UPSTREAM to the Bitcoin Core devs instead.
This is not a change that is necessary on Gentoo systems to make Bitcoin Core run better on that system, or something that is otherwise specific to Gentoo systems. It is a purely general change to Bitcoin Core that is applied only to one specific distribution, never mind the question of whether people think it is a relevant change or not.
Tl;dr: Remove the change from the Gentoo package, and post it as a pull request to Bitcoin Core instead.

Sounds nice. Trying to add my non-US Visa card once again prompted the error "Your billing information was incorrect", even though it is indeed correct. Is this still your quite confusing way to tell your customers that their cards are not supported?

He doesn't. If you read the post you replied to, he sacrifices a small amount of privacy for the security of being able to receive a payment even though not having access to a btc wallet. Something that is expected to happen only extremely rarely.

So far so good, but if you use Purse to buy a Netflix gift card, that Netflix gift card surely won't be in BTC. Neither will the payment that Amazon receives in the end.


The receiver being Amazon? I seriously doubt that.
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:12:02
So, in order for that to work, you just need to bring in services from 2 additional companies. Seems like a hassle to me, not even considering the fact that this might not work everywhere in the world where Netflix offer their services.
And, the Netflix gift card is in what? American dollars or some other fiat? Following that logic, you can buy *anything*, *everywhere* in the world with Bitcoin. Just add the intermediate step of converting your BTC to the appropriate fiat first and use that to pay with.
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:01:15


So, essentially you're buying a Netflix card from Purse, not from Amazon, right? That's good, but the chain still breaks at the Netflix gift card stage. All Netflix cards that I've seen are issued in some kind of fiat. If they were not issued in a currency, but instead like "this card gives you one month of Netflix" -- then we would be close :-)

Looks very nice.
I am interested in knowing why, on the back side, you use the letter Ø in place of the letter O. As you know, Ø is not just an O with a slash through it; it is a letter on its own. In the same way that Q is not an O with a diacritic to it, and C is not an O with a small piece removed.
Oh, and if you do use it once, why not do it consistently?

Ok, so the real analogy would be:
That's like saying you just went on a short visit to an Asylum after having not been there for more than a year, and realised everyone in there was crazy. Implying they didn't seem to be a year earlier.

LOL, it sounds like you are describing something that happened 20-30 years ago. But, well, I guess when you say you went to school "years ago", it's still technically correct, even though those years can almost be counted on a single hand ;-)

And in the same Twitter thread, the author links to their obviously scammy "large-scale competition" allowing people to send an amount of their choice to an ETH or BTC address and get a larger sum back, complete with (faked!) in and out going transactions for that address.
Seems legit, indeed.

On the other hand, we do see a lot of companies dealing in the bitcoin space showing the "Bitcoin" banner high and low, whereas companies in the fiat or paper money space don't really. So maybe there just is this difference.

Ok, I follow you guys' reasoning, and I'll probably get downvoted for this, but:
Isn't it possible that they don't mean "the bitcoin chief", i.e. "the chief of bitcoin", but instead "a bitcoin chief", i.e. "a chief of a bitcoin related company"? Same thing with "Bitcoin CEO", btw.
If the headline had read "Bank CEO arrested in London", would you think it was the CEO of all banks in the world?

Sorry, but if you're paying at a fiat credit card terminal (that doesn't natively support bitcoin), you're not paying with bitcoin -- you're converting your bitcoin to fiat, and then paying with fiat.
This is just a more convenient alternative to selling off some BTC and having the resulting fiat transferred to your paying credit card.
A step in the right direction, yes, but not "paying with bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:01:23
Don't want to be the spoilsport, but how much attention do you reckon this Bitcoin version has enjoyed outside of the Bitcoin community, and perhaps their immediate relatives (Facebook friends, etc.)? Not that much, I'm afraid. Preaching for the already saved souls is nice, but it doesn't really take us anywhere.
But, of course, my claim is as unsupported by fact as yours, so we might both be right.

Actually he didn't. He specifically mentioned that the signing is not to be interpreted as an endorsement. That doesn't mean it is a rejection.
So if I say: "I'm not saying the car is blue", then I haven't said anything about its colour. It might be blue, or it might not.
So he might endorse it, or he might not. I don't know. But this post doesn't reveal his opinion on the matter.

Reminds me of back when people were trying to push micro BTC (or one of several aliases) as the default denomination, and for some obscure reason abbreviated it uBTC instead of µBTC, even though (as I assume most people would know) u and µ are not even close to being the same letter. One's even a vowel while the other's a consonant.

Really? So I will get 0.00067 USD per bitcoin? That seems quite valuable to me.
Time to sell some USD. With that rate I'll get ~1492 BTC for a dollar...

Ok, so by that logic tap water is worth more than five times as much as petrol/gasoline.
Tap water is priced to households per the m³ (cubic metre). So that's the standard measure, and definitely not arbitrary. Around here, the price is around (what equals to) USD 8.64 per m³ of tap water.
Petrol/gasoline is sold at the filling stations per the litre. So that's the standard measure, and definitely not arbitrary. Around here, the price is around (what equals to) USD 1.50 per litre of 95 octan petrol.
Point is, comparing ounces (of gold) to BTC (of bitcoin) is like comparing apples to oranges (as is the example above, in case anyone was wondering)

Not around here, at least. In my town there are several branches of the country's largest bank. In only one of them can you actually go to the counter to deposit or withdraw cash. The rest are "cashless branches", and the closest thing you can get to cash there is a withdraw-only ATM.
In other words, if you received an amount of cash that is larger than you feel safe carrying around or storing at your house (or spending in the near future), you're screwed. Unless you want to queue for ages in the one branch that does handle cash.

Not everyone that you disagree with is a troll. I'm not defending this person (I don't know him/her), but in this case, there may be some truth to it, depending on how you view it.
The "problem" probably lies with Coinbase much more than with Bitcoin. Or, rather, with the fact that Coinbase acts as a bank that holds your bitcoins for you. If OP had instead opted to "Use Bitcoin Address" instead of "Use Coinbase Wallet" in the payment window, then bitcoin had indeed been involved (at least some of the way) -- or in other words, a bitcoin transaction had occurred on the blockchain.
Paying for an article at Dell through your Coinbase wallet involves no transaction on the blockchain. Plus it's not decentralized in any way. Holding your bitcoins yourself and paying to a bitcoin address does and is (more so, at least).

Segwit, no doubt. Already implemented and tested, ready for "Go".
Then we'll see afterwards whether there's any need for a bump to 2 or 4 MB (which there very well might be, considering we've been AT the 1 MB limit for quite some time now), and the time after Segwit deployment can be used to thoroughly test a block size hard fork. Or a variable limit. Or whatever makes the most sense in that new situation that we'll be in.
