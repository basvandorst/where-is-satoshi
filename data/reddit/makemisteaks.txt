That’s awesome. But can I also do it manually though? I keep a ledger and paper wallets and transfer between them so it would be fine to have an app that can accomodate those coin movements.
Thanks a lot for replying. Awesome work.

Can you record your transfers and track where your coins are located? Or does it only register the total of what you’re holding?

Best decision I made was to sell BCH as soon as I had the chance. Until then I had invested solely on BTC and ETH. With that extra cash I really diversified my portfolio and dabbed in a few altcoins. I didn't want to risk any more of my own money so the free coins allowed me to play it a little bit riskier.

This isn't really a good example. Laws don't simply cease to exist because you're playing a game.
Your example would be better if this particular Laser tag was located in Somalia. In which case, yes. You could steal money, kill and basically walk away from it. Because there's no regulation or enforcers of any kind of laws.  
If it is unregulated then you depend on the people of the community itself to enforce the consequences or not (because there's no government so no police to call) which is hard in the case of Bitcoin because it's supposed to be anonymous making it almost impossible for people to be judged for their actions.  
This will happen again. That is just basic human nature. Some of them are complete assholes...

Really? That's a total rip off. Here all withdrawals are free because the company that operates the ATMs is a separate entity from the banks.  
We do have a 0.50€ cents online transfer fee (most banks have it but not all). 5$ is ridiculous.

So, just to be clear, I should just download whatever wallet trades in BCC and just import the same key I use on my BTC wallet, and it will copy whatever amount I had in BTC and make it into BCC? Sorry for the noob question.

Any paper wallet will do? Should I put them in breadwallet for iOS? Or is it better that I go with a desktop wallet? I've been mainly storing them in Coinbase, but it appears that the site will never allow users to access their "alternative" coins after the fork. Thanks for the help, in advance.

I ended up choosing Electrum for desktop. But thanks a lot for the help.
