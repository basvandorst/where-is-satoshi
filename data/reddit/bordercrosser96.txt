I don't understand how the IRS or anyone could determine the currency as foreign or domestic though...what were your lawyer's grounds if you don't mind sharing

If bitcoin survives, do you really think it's realistic to think in the near future the IRS won't find a way to get a cut? Just a thought, but they could develop a system where complying with tax laws would make bitcoin users eligible for deductions...
I'm all for sticking it to the IRS, but one thing I don't understand is the outlook that bitcoin will survive if the government can't get a cut. Or not necessarily fail to survive, but fail to reach the level that it could if the government jumps on board. Eventually allowing the currency to grow to a point where it could compete with fiat. Which IMO is the ultimate goal.

I don't think bitcoin has the power to "shutdown the government" that's a pretty bold statement, but the question still stands, do we not want the government involved at all?

I thought it was pretty good too.

This site also congregated some awesome links in their 'Useful Links' page. Most people who have a decent understand of BTC have probably seen most of these. But if you're a newbie or just want to see a bunch of cool shit in once place here it is.

This site is great for a wide variety of things...

But more specifically, my favorite one is Peter Surda's page where it shows all of his research, publications, and lectures. This guy is my idol.

I second that. It's too difficult to start from scratch now unless you have thousands to invest from the start. Find a site that allows you to donate and be a member.
