Why are you making so many assumptions?
I like the tech and I believe it's useful. Doesn't make me blind to the reality that most people are just in it for the money. I am not a big fan of BTC in particular, especially after the push to off-chain stuff like LN. But still, the market's performance is pegged to BTC so I have to monitor it. 
And you haven't answered my question. Did you not understand the figurative use of "nobody"?

Miners got tricked into accepting segwit with the agreement that it will later lead to 2mb blocks. There was no consensus prior to that. 
Don't think it will work again. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:52:22


No that is not what I am saying.


You let others go first by paying a fee lower than they do.
My point is that if you're only willing to pay 100 sats/byte it doesn't matter if they pay 10000 sats/byte or 1000000 sats/byte for their tx. How much fee they are paying has no effect on you unless you want to beat their fee.

I think you're being sarcastic, but a surprisingly large percentage of gold is actually used in jewelry and industrial applications. 52% and 12% respectively according to 
Not that I think it makes gold a good investment. And yes, the people buying and trading gold are just doing to make money. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:31:46


No, you have to *beat* their fees to get in before them. Which is why they pay high tx fees. If you let them go first, it doesn't matter if they pay 50 sats or 1 btc fee.

Nobody is actually interested in using crypto. They are just trying to get wealthy by speculating on the price. 
It's a sad realization but there is no use in denying it.

Saying it like that doesn't make it sound like a ponzi at all.

If you're gonna be obtuse and think that I meant literally  nobody, then yeah I guess you win. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:39:21
I am genuinely curios, do you not understand that when someone says "nobody", it's not always meant literally?
Like if I said "Nobody likes putting mayo on their steak", would you go find 1 in 1000000 people who do can call me out on my bullshit?
No shit there are some people who use crypto. I have used crypto like 2 times to pay for stuff. However the overwhelming majority of people are in it just to make money.

I think it's actually 0.106mbsp. You can do that on GPRS, if anyone remembers what that is.

Spoiler: they were lying to pump up the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:12
So you want 2mb, but because someone else you don't like  suggested it first, you didn't want it at the time? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:45
This really doesn't make sense. Bitcoin is a store of value. Don't try to make a square peg fit a round hole. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:48


That sounds exactly like it's about who suggested it as if that would make them leaders.
The core team could have just made the 2mb modification themselves (it's rather simple afaik), and continued to be the dev leader.

Bitcoin Core developer.

The 2x part of the segwti2x was the block increase so give btc time to adopt 2nd layer solutions.
The vast majority of BTC community decided against it, because... I don't know.
People, like myself, who wanted 2x have already moved to other things.

People market buying on an overloaded/lagging exchange. That will happen. This is why you should never market buy. Make a limit order 10% above/below the current price if you want to market buy.

That is literally the purpose of open source. If that's what they are going to do, it's 100% appropriate use of open source. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:20:28
The forked side is also open source, it wouldn't work any other way.
The "open sources devs now", aka the Bitcoin Core devs, would just need to change the blocksize. That's it. They keep control and we get 2 mb blocks. Done.

Mining bigger blocks is not any more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:32:03
I'll elaborate since you actually seem interested in a counter opinion.


I have yet to see any evidence to support this. The biggest hole in this theory is that most people seem to not understand that for tx spam to actually have any effect, the spam txs need to beat the fees of "real" txs. As you may know, that's very very expensive right now. Another point is that if they are paying a higher fee that you, what makes you entitled to say that your tx is real and their tx is spam? Whoever pays more gets in, it's a free market. Yet another point is that if some entity can afford to make the network unusable for months without going bankrupt, you have a whole new set of problems that won't be resolved by just hoping for the "bad guy" to stop. 


Don't know about Jihan, but Roger Ver while being a strange and slightly unhinged character, seems to believe entirely in what he's doing and saying. I doubt he has any intentions to dump his stash. If he wanted to use his riches to get even richer, there are much easier ways to go about in crypto world other than running this elaborate scheme. 


This relies on your as far as I know unbased (and unreasonable) assumption that the network is being spammed. 
disclosure: I have about 4% of my crypto in bch. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:22:48
You're not going to find an unbiased answer to that question.
The prevailing opinion is that Segwit2x was an attempt to "overthrow" Bitcoin Core developers. Bitcoin Core are strongly against increasing the block size, so if the block size was to be increased, Bitcoin Core would not longer in control of bitcoin, which to some is a tragedy.
They think off-chain solutions like Lightning Network and sidechains will solve the issues. Bitcoin will be a settlement layer where the balances will be finalized after a lot of transactions are made outside of it.
I think I will get banned for saying this, but you should check the btc subreddit if you want you hear the other side of the argument. This place is highly censored. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:54
Says they are adding Bitcoin Cash. What's BCash? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:00:33


The "the Bitcoin community at large" has vehemently rejected an increase in blocksize, and most people who were for it have moved to bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:55:30
You're actually deluded. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:47:29
Common misconception from people new to crypto, but mining bigger blocks does not require more mining "power"/hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:22
I am in fact not 12. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:56
Why would it be coopted and how? You say it like changing blocks to 2 mb gives Roger Ver or Jihan some super powers or something.
I mean it proves that they were right, but that's about it. And it seems like you agree that they are right anyway, you're just very careful about admitting it.

The self-mined transactions wouldn't be included for free. In practice, they have an opportunity and operation cost. There is no difference between losing $30 on a spam transaction that someone else mines, and not making $30 on a real transaction because you're just replacing it with your own. The net result is the same. 
Mining only your own TXs is the same as mining empty blocks which they could just do. The reason miners don't mine empty blocks is because they are incentivized by the fees to include the transactions.
For the second point, the big issue is that it's not all that expensive to spam the BTC network with transactions. Even if you think it's Roger Ver doing it now and you hope he eventually stops (don't know why you think he will stop if he's so evil and powerful), you're still left with a massive problem other bad actors can exploit to attack BTC. What if the banks or a government wants to attack bitcoin? They have waaaaay more money than Roger Ver. They could keep up the spam for years. As long as you have a small transaction/s capacity, it's pretty cheap to take up all the slots with bogus transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:36:12
Read about Segwit2x. The btc community is almost universally against increasing the blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:40:04
Speculative bubble. New ~~investors~~ buyers such as yourself saw bitcoin as a way to make money so they bought some.
Now that the price stopped going up and it isn't making people easy money anymore, people are taking their profits (or losses) and leaving.
Nobody can tell you what will make the price spike or drop in the near future.

I got an idea. How about we double the blocksize? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:43:49
The miners and the part of community that wanted bigger blocks was tricked. It is a bad thing.
This was a compromise agreement and most of the community rejected the 2nd  part of the compromise after getting what they want. 
It's a very strong case against planning any future compromises and moving bitcoin forward.

2.5k is the very low bound of my estimation.
Don't know why people think 2.5k is so unrealistic. Another 50% drop from 6k that we touched not long ago would have brought it to 3k. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:05:57
The article actually got it backwards. Newbies are by far the biggest group pledging to "HODL" because they are unwilling to realize a loss.

Alright, so lets say someone gets enough asics to do a 51% attack.
1. How are we going to kick those bastards off the network and how would the protocol be reworked around them? 
2. How is above going to happen so fast that the attackers will only get 1 block worth of dominance? 
If the answer is to switch to a different PoW algo, doesn't that make the next attack significantly more easy?
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:55:42
The difficulty of doing a 51% attack right now is so high because of the huge number as asics securing the network. A switch to a different PoW to invalidate the attack asics will also invalidate the good actor asics.
The new PoW algorithm, even if it's asic friendly will not have any asics running on it for months because they take long to develop. So it will have to use consumer hardware in the meantime. And there are huge mining farms using consumer hardware that can now perform 51% attack on bitcoin while suffering only operational+opportunity costs. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:45:20
Realistically, between 2.5k and 11k. Probably closer to the 2.5k range.
