Doubt the feds would ruin a money laundering honeypot to scam a few bucks.

Buy bitcoin of course. Duh!

Use my money to pressure acceptance from more retailers. Which has the benefit of giving me more places to buy stuff. Which gives bitcoin more exposure.

That actually made me sick to read. Poor, poor delusional man.

This is why over 95% of criminal cases end in pleas. It's just too risky to fight it on the hopes that a judge or jury will see things your way. The entire legal system has been compromised in my opinion.

So why even codify the law at all? Why not just write it truthfully and say "anyone who seems to be doing shifty things with their own money can become suspect and have their assets seized." Since that's how it works in practice why not be honest? Why bother with a $10,000 at all?

That's really scary. It's like saying "the speed limit is 55mph, but if you're going 54mph we'll pull you over because it seems like you've got something to hide."

Is every localbitcoin user "guilty" of this also? 
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:53:52
People did similar things with newsgroups when they were more popular.

I'll sell you anything you want for gold. Give me the gold, and I'll go get it for you. Of course, there is a small fee.

Meet guy in Starbucks, pay cash, receive bitcoin.

They would have only lost 50% this year instead of 100.

This thread has made me more excited for the future of bitcoin than I've been in years.

Just like how if you withdrawal money from an atm and use it to buy drugs or weapons, the bank will be shut down and the atm owner arrested. 
... Oh wait, that's not true at all.

It would be nice if at least more opportunities were given to prisoners. More access to computers, jobs outside of prison even remotely. Things like that.

It's going to be great software! After your daily morning blowjob it cleans up the house before letting itself out. 
Seriously though, even that would be way overvalued.

From what I understand, he can absolutely not receive a sentence of less than 20 years at this point. The fact that he wrote the letter knowing he'll spend that much time behind bars makes it a lot more sincere to me.

Have them leave it somewhere in a duffel bag, send your dumb friend to go pick it up. 
Don't tell him anything about any of it. If he gets caught, then they're out the btc permanently and the deal is off the table. Without having gained anything. 
Best I can come up with on short notice.

OK... Scratch that. How about a hobo?

The underlying algorithms? No. The application of those? Yes. Just look through the history of this sub

I wouldn't compare selling mushrooms to supplying addicts. No one is addicted to mushrooms, and by the time of the end of SR, there were some genuinely criminal drug dealers involved, moving some serious weight, to serious addicts.

You're seriously overestimating the abilities of your average hooker or the people that pay them.

Probably because a group of older, masterful social engineers who have been plying their trade for decades ran a train on a naive 20 something year old whose only life experience was behind a computer screen. 
These undercover operations are so huge and elaborate, the many pieces that have been revealed recently only likely show a small part of the story.
They'll infiltrate a group, site, organization, gang, whatever, and using wiretaps (legal or otherwise), confidential informants, flipped insiders, information gathered with subpoenas, computer intrusions, and any other resource at their disposal to play all of the people involved against each other, and eventually themselves. 
They'll tell you things they couldn't possibly know without being who they say they are.  Creating insane personas of cartel leaders, biker gang members, legendary hackers, hardened murderers. Leading you to respect them, or wanting to do things for them. Eventually taking the role of a leader, taking you by the hand. By the end, when you're so deep in over your head and out of your element, you'll be running to them to help you solve problems that only ever existed because of them.

I'm guessing it was a rushed attempt to boost dogecoin value.

Fun idea for a 25 year old with a few thousand dollars in savings. A lot scarier for a 50-60 year old with tens, or hundreds of thousands saved for retirement.

The difference being not a single customer of any of the banks will lose money.

There are a lot of people on Craigslist offering that service. I've done it before when I needed some extra money. Or post an ad asking someone to help you pick up X from X store on X date and time.

Home depot rents trucks for tasks like this. Pretty cheap too.

Free rent and he can't save money for a cheap car? You can get an old civic for $1000. Giving this guy money would likely have the same impact on his life as throwing it in the garbage.

Next time put a teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water. Works in a pinch.
