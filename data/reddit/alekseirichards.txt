How would the payment creation API work ?

How does this compare to  ?
CarbonWallet is not using a server at all, and can be downloaded as a chrome app.
Did you use carbonwallet as a basis for your app ?

To clarify because their marketing is not great. The business model appears to be that the code is open source and they are looking to provide consulting for it.
The server would support a number of different bitcoin businesses, i.e. wallets, block explorers, mobile, satoshi dice clones etc.
Personally I think they should host it SaaS style. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 08:07:33
Your site **can't be trusted** because you are deploying the javascript from your own server.
At any moment you could switch out the Javascript and capture peoples private keys.
This is exactly why  is hosted out of github, for transparency with open code.

Not really a Bitcoin related issue though, I think you would be better off looking at oDesk.

It's called the Russian federation now.

Looks nice, but it also looks like they are storing Bitcoins on their own servers.

He made a mistake, but he is still has the right to carry on living.

The private keys are generated from the passphrase on the fly in memory. It doesn't store them anywhere.
A private key is just a 256bit number. It can be any number in that range. So CarbonWallet converts your passphrase into a seed number, then generates 10 private keys from that number.
It then takes those numbers and generates the corresponding public kesy. i.e. the 1asdda556... numbers.
There's more help here

Looks really great actually. 
The font looks a bit jagged to me.
The workflow is really intuitive, I think if you manage to get a bank account you'll be onto a winner.
How are you going to manage price volatility between the order stage and actual payment ?

How the fuck did that ripple piece of shit get into the article.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:20:00
Seriously ? OK perhaps these guys are legitimate but why take the risk.
Open up  and generate a passphrase. The passphrase by the way would be compatible with electrum. CarbonWallet runs completely in the browser and the source is available to view.
Worried about viruses on your machine etc ? Run it on a kindle.
Stop listening to the people that come on here and spout off that online wallets can't be trusted. Paper wallets are not the way forward for bitcoin adoption.

There's no evidence that technical analysis is useful for any currency.

Quite easy to do if you spent as much time thinking about it as you did creating your well formatted response.
They could create the transaction client side and add the fee. Then create another transaction refunding the fee to your account.

Tattoo Wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:56:11
This is why with  we don't allow you to use your own passphrase. Our passphrases are 128bit in length, very secure but still easy to write down.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:43:10
That's the point. I'm using namecheap and when I get referred to the bitpay page it says my ip is banned.
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:48:15
Not sure of an easy way to do that, but clone the git repository would be one way.
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:32:59
I would say initially you should tell people that you are going to fulfill the order at whatever the price is when you process the order. But, perhaps they should be able to cancel the order if you still haven't bought the coins yet.
You don't want to have the problem that you buy coins and then people want refunds in a falling market. You will drown.
Avoid refunds.

Not working for me either.

Thanks for this cilphex.
The changes will be merged soon pending a question I've asked on github.
@_date: 2013-06-06 07:15:04
This is an excellent response. Perhaps if dacoinminster had an elevator pitch that would help things along.
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:09:34
Sounds interesting. Where would this be based and what kind of return would 1.2gh/s give ?
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:46:27
A Bitcoin private key is 256bits, the passphrases on CarbonWallet are 128bit, this is still a very massive number.
For Bitcoin to become more mainstream asking people to install a client on there computer is not the answer. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:15:47
In sales there's an expression "Telling is not selling". From a book by Neil Rackham called Spin Selling. One of the few sales books actually based on research.
So, you should consider asking questions first, then provide answers if asked. Otherwise you might come across as a Bitcoin evangelist rather than a useful resource of information.

This is intended for small change wallets. I think people have to get around the idea that you put all your Bitcoins in 1 place.
@_date: 2013-05-08 07:24:27
This is my thinking too.
The charge a 1% commission fee but deliver coins days later. In a rising market they will lose money, it's simple maths.
1. User buys coins at 100 USD.
2. Coinbase wait a few days to verfiy user.
3. Coinbase deliver coins, but now price is 140 USD. A 40% loss.
Also 1% doesn't cover their risk. i.e. US accounts can do charge backs as far as I understand it. So they would need very low chargeback rates to cover 1%.
However, if they keep getting funding like this, then they don't need to make a profit.

Carbon Wallet 
Electrum compatible, deterministic and publicly available source code.

It's great that the big payment processors have the best marketing departments, yet Bitcoin is getting all the best press.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:17:48
The problem is, how would they buy and sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-06 10:52:11
**Actually**, it's not as great as it sounds.
It's only 0.0001BTC miners fee to send a transaction anyway. That's 1 cent. 
For example, here's a private key with 10 cents.
Someone can snatch that up and retain 90% or more. I can send micro transactions around by email.

Not sure what the posters point is. Law applies to everyone, if the directors acted illegal according to the law and there was evidence of this they would probably have been prosecuted.
@_date: 2013-07-24 07:45:40
**Electrum passphrases are the way to go**. That way your wallet is effectively portable between clients. 
So say for example you create a new wallet on 
You'll get a passphrase like 
"skill shimmer forgotten sink false bathroom odd prince excuse depend slice quickly"
Now you can take that passphrase between the following
1. CarbonWallet for a web based wallet.
2. Electrum  for a desktop wallet.
3. The new android Electrum wallet mentioned already here.
So you get choose the best software for each platform rather than committing coins only to one provider.
@_date: 2013-05-15 07:30:58
Also take a look at  electrum compatible and zero footprint.

Bug with retrieving the balance. I'll get it looked at. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:38:21
Yes, passphrases should be protected in the same way you would protect your password for an encrypted wallet.
There's a section on the home page titles "Consider Multiple Passphrases". Here we advise people to only bring online a passphrase with a small amount of BTC. For larger amounts you can download CarbonWallet and use it offline. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:23:09
I like the ideas you have written up.
It's B that concerns me.
Cheaters can only get blacklisted after they have received money and not returned it.
The user would see this as a problem with the exchange and create a support ticket there. The exchange may not have the power to pursue the cheater.

What database is this using ?
Would be good to get the blockchain into a relational database.

If you are going to use a brainwallet use 
It generate a passphrase for you.

**How To:** Cold storage with 
1. Think of a really long password.
2. Type it into the passphrase field.
3. Transfer coins at your convenience.
4. Done.

You will normally find people on Bitcoinary who will do this.
i.e. 
Be careful and use the escrow.

A bitcoin private key is just an 256bit number. It can be any number, so all you need is a function that turns a list of words into a number and you then have a bitcoin private key.
This is how carbon wallet works. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 07:04:18
Don't use a paper wallet it's a waste of time and energy. If you need to sell your coins quickly you'll be figuring out how to transfer private keys into an online service.
Either use electrum or

Hi redketh,
Would you be interested in helping out with  ? Source code available here 
It would be a great way for you to improve your Github profile and also gain experience in HTML5, JQuery, and bitcoin protocols.
Things that I'd like to see added are
1. Temporary private key import.
2. AES encrypt passphrase on local computer.
3. Responsive on mobile and tablet.
Let me know what you think.
