the key never leaves the device, so it is secure. and in any case a single component will decrypt everything (the seed).


that is a great idea. can you implement it? i'm not sure how to implement the algorithm needed:
* seed to private key
* the decryption method itself using the private key (what trezor is doing)

You can use this script with keepass. in keepass, save the entire encrypted line as your password. so for example save this as your password:
    tz:myuser
now you want to login to a website? copy this "password" from keypass to the clipboard, and then run the script, which will change your clipboard to the decrypted version of your password, using trezor
To make it easier and to be able to run the script right after you copied the password to the clipboard, just make a global keyboard shortcut to the script. [some examples on how to do that](

i think trezor-agent is a great tool for gpg and ssh, but that implementation doesnt work on windows
also, gpg files are too big to be stored easily on an existing password manager. with my implementation, just copy and store the encrypted password wherever you want.
