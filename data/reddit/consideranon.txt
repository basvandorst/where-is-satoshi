Sure, but better that than release something broken or untested on time. I'm all for criticizing authority, but at the end of the day, no one has earned more trust than the Core team. Maybe we don't agree with every decision they make, but the development they do is rock solid. As a developer, it's a breath of fresh air to see a developer led project refuse to sacrifice quality for the sake of making deadlines. Sacrificing quality for good optics might be ok in other businesses where image matters more than solid engineering, but not bitcoin where billions of dollars worth of value is at stake.

Agreed. Plus, doing this once sets a dangerous precedent. Maybe we do it again for the next few heists. Then governments start requiring miners in their jurisdiction start blacklisting known blackmarket activities. Start with the REALLY bad stuff like child porn that everyone agrees should be stopped. Then start blacklisting grey areas in the black market, like soft drugs. Like law, precedents build on each other and can lead to a slippery slope. 
Of course, even if we avoid blacklisting in this case, there will be another temptation to do it again for the next major theft. And the next and the next. The only way to really solve this is with improvements to the protocol for truly fungible bitcoin. It's a shame that scaling problems seems to have sidelined privacy improvements.

It should absolutely deter big investors who intend to trust a third party to hold and secure their coins the same way they would trust a bank to hold and secure their dollars. Bitcoin banking is obviously still severely lacking. Then again, there's little difference to thieves breaking into physical vaults and running away with cash and gold. Bitcoin banks have just had less time to mature their security measures and mechanisms for spreading risk of these inevitable thefts.

I have to say, as a developer, the big block movement really feels like a massive managineering effort. The kind of situation where all the technical experts agree on the proper design/plan, and then the MBA managers come in and push a technically compromised design/plan that meets their agenda. 
The Core team's plan feels like exactly the right technical solution, even if to the layman, it looks like nothing's happening. Laying solid foundation takes time. Just like building a skyscraper, it takes significantly longer to build the foundation than the actual building. But once the foundation is laid, the tower shoots up. If you start building up too soon, your foundation will be weak and the building will crumble at the first earthquake.

Cool. Hopefully lots of people are thinking like this. Just means demand is lower and I'll be able to accumulate more coins before the effect of a constantly decreasing rate of inflation increases the value. In another 8 years, after the 4th halving, inflation rate will drop to &lt; 1%. That's not that long to wait, but still as far in the future as bitcoin's birth is in the past. Tons of improvements will happen in that time to make bitcoin even more valuable independent of limited supply. 
Privacy improvements are coming. Lightning is being developed. Private key management is getting easier and safer. Mining chip improvements are leveling off which should start to re-decentralize mining. Sidechains are bringing smart contracts. ETF will enable on-ramp for old money and retirement accounts. You better believe I'll be adding some to my Roth IRA.
BItcoin is not some goddamn get big fast and sell out startup. Core devs are building the internet value and trust, and that's something you just can't fuck up. Scalable, maintainable, and decentralized improvements take time and extreme care to plan, implement, test, and deploy, which is why I for one applaud the core devs for their refusal to bend to whims of fools who scream for growth at any cost. Works for startups who build apps to send pics between friends. Doesn't work for a decentralized system of programmable money where billions of dollars of value are currently on the line. 
Obviously, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, because there is a very real possibility to lose everything, either by loss of private keys or some unknown, fundamental flaw in the protocol itself. But other than this, do you have any good reason to believe that the effects of dropping inflation and protocol improvement will not lead to increasing value over time? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:12:07
That's a fair assessment. Perhaps deter is too strong of a word. It should definitely give pause. Even though it was not strictly a bank, bitfinex had at least 1% of the entire bitcoin supply. That theft is irreversible unless the thief is apprehended and coerced to giving up his keys. Even if others are doing security right, this illustrates that it's easy to do things VERY wrong. 
No security will ever be 100% perfect, and big investors need to be aware of the risks and how to best protect themselves.

You're absolutely right. Thanks for being a level headed voice. It's far too easy as a developer to lose patience with non-technical users and forget about the chasm that lies between our ways of thinking. Part of our job is building bridges across that chasm. 
At the same time, it's a two way street, and as you point out, we're dealing with a thing that holds billions of dollars worth of value.

That's true. That's why I don't think it would warrant a major version change since Schnorr support is backward compatible. Same as segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:12:04
Probably a hardfork would warrant it. The major version is usually incremented to indicate a backwards incompatible change to the software. It would make it very clear that running 0.x software won't worked on a 1.x network.
Beyond increasing blocksize, there are several features that might be bundled in one big fork,  Yet another reason the Core team resisted segwit2x. Hardforks take a lot of time and effort to achieve consensus for, so you might as well bundle in as many good changes as you can.

One year seems fair, at least for common usability. For more technical users, sooner. Some B2B transactions may be able to utilize it sooner as well. 
What data are you using to suggest that segwit only buys us 6 months? Average blocksize is only now hitting the max, and it took nearly 2 years to double from 500kb. Segwit is nearly double blocksize increase, so even assuming blocksize rate of growth doubles, that's still 1 year before we hit a max again. Two years if the rate remains the same. So this would align perfectly with an arbitrary 1 year for LN usability, at which time many of the transactions could be offloaded trustlessly. Rootstock may help even more. 
Of course, you didn't clearly state your position on segwit/BU, but would you really argue that we should deploy a new, untested consensus algorithm over segwit, which includes important non scaling improvements and buys us time to implement cleaner L2 scaling? Especially when these solutions are already working in testnet?

Yep. Sticking with energy == wealth model, free energy will only ever happen through some kind of UBE (UBI but energy rather than income), where a society decides that every individual has a right to a certain amount of energy, beyond which you have to pay market price. This could be one way to make sure individual humans don't just get bulldozed over by rich and powerful forces. 
One nitpick, I don't think I agree that energy is the most abstract form of wealth. More abstract than gold or oil, yes, but more concrete than numbers. The way I'm thinking about it is that you could theoretically build a money system with energy itself. e.g. a battery is a wallet and you transfer value by pushing the stored energy to another battery. But this has a lot of the same problems as gold, like difficult to store/safeguard and slow/expensive to transfer.

Sounds like this means that everyone will effectively be penalized for receiving payments to legacy addresses. Should go a long way towards expediting the transition to majority segwit transactions and taking full advantage of the blocksize increase. 
I do wonder if we'll see a few weeks of big backlogs, high fees, and massive number of coin days destroyed as holders move their coins to segwit addresses. On the other hand, there's no reason for these people to not wait for a low fee time period and move coins then.

They're called 'bits'. One millionth of a bitcoin. One bit has 100 satoshis (currently the smallest possible unit). If Bitcoin reaches $1,000,000, the 1 bit == 1 dollar, and 1 satoshi == 1 cent.

That's why lightning was so mindbogglingly exciting when it was presented years ago. Before that, most everyone who understood the scaling issue was resigned to the fact that we would probably have to settle with centralized L2 solutions like coinbase and bitpay. See Hal Finney's comment. 
With LN we suddenly had the possibility of trustless, decentralized L2 scaling. All it needed from bitcoin was CheckLockTimeVerify and a malleability fix. Now that Segwit's active, both of these prereqs are fulfilled and LN can be developed without permission or need to deal with the core protocol ossification or politics.

I tend to agree with Luke on this. Given how popular bitcoin has become recently in the mainstream financial world, I think we can expect more serious efforts to attack cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is still VERY vulnerable and increasing blocksize only makes it cheaper to attack effectively. 
We have options to build out layer two transfer systems that can give us orders of magnitude scaling. A blocksize increase solves zero real problems and makes the network weaker because the act of supporting the network becomes more expensive.

Segwit is not intended to be a solution for transaction capacity. It's intended to be an architectural improvement that will enable layer 2 scaling solutions and eliminate existing attack vectors, making bitcoin stronger and truly scalable. The fact that it also happens to be a temporary solution for transaction capacity is a neat side effect.
Block size alone will never handle the scale we want bitcoin to get to. Nobody is saying 1mb forever. There's just more effective things we can do right now to improve the technology while it's not yet completely ossified. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:45:15
Cheap and fast onchain transactions were never going to last. The only reason it was that in the past was because transactions were subsidized by significant inflation. Miner income from coin inflation is becoming less significant every year and must be replaced by fees if the network is going to be able to support increasing proof of work security. 
That's why the key focus of the majority of developers is on layer two solutions. It's the only way we can have exponential transaction growth and cheap, fast micro transactions.
Clinging to a past that was never sustainable is a recipe for failure, and I applaud the core developers who recognize this and are putting in the work to make Bitcoin scale for real.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:44:43

It almost feels like big blockers could be driven by some powerful groups to attack bitcoin. Seems sensible that rather than outright ban it, infiltrate the community and corrupt from the inside in order to stagnate development and improvement, keeping it a neutered toy rather than the giant it could be. 
Bitcoin as Satoshi built it was never going to scale for global usage. That criticism was literally in the first comment after he published the white paper. [1] Segwit enables the incredible ability to build truly scalable layer 2 solutions in a distributed, trustless, and potentially private way. Lightning is probably closer to actual p2p e-cash that bitcoin alone will ever be. It's really hard to understand how rbtc doesn't see this.

Open for all to read, not discussed in closed rooms like s2x. Code is written for all to see on github, not closed source dev like certain forks.
Of course it needs to be moderated, otherwise extremely technical and complex discussion would be drowned out by low brow reddit style garbage, like many of my own comments.
As a developer, I wouldn't feel comfortable contributing in large ways (e.g. scaling solutions) until I had made smaller contributions to the project and gotten fully up to speed on the state of the art, which would probably take years. If I came in with some half baked scaling proposal, no research, no code, and no reputation in the community, I would fully expect to get banned for wasting everyone's time, and rightly so.

Maybe that was his goal, but Satoshi failed at making it happen. Layer one bitcoin doesn't scale.
However, he indirectly succeeded by creating a system that allows for permission-less, off-chain transactions (like LN) that will allow us to do small, casual transactions. Other brilliant people are now carrying the torch to make his vision a reality. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:52:28
We're doing both. The core dev community already released a blocksize increase via segwit, though in an indirect way.
Segwit increased the effective blocksize to 4MB with the change to blockweight. Pure segwit transactions would get us to 1.7, and Schnorr signatures will increase it further. 
Basically, the core developers deployed a blocksize increase, but it can only be realized if users upgrade to more efficient transaction types. They basically put an economic incentive on companies to upgrade rather than be lazy and continue with wasteful, legacy transactions. Pretty brilliant if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:08
S2x would allow for up to 8MB blocks. That would mean you'd use at least 30GB per month of you internet bandwidth to run a node (assuming you only download blocks and don't share). If you only have 100GB limit or less as many people do, then this increase threatens your ability to run your own node.

@_date: 2017-11-05 19:44:24
It's a little confusing, but basically, it's because S2X doesn't contribute anything to making transactions more efficient, it just doubles the allowed limit. On the other hand, Schnorr signatures dramatically decrease the space requirements for certain types of transactions. 
Segwit introduced the concept of block weight. Different types of transactions are given different weights subject to their efficiency. Segwit transactions are more efficient than legacy transactions, so they get a lower weight, which allows the total blocksize to grow &gt;1MB. The upper limit on block weight theoretically allows total blocksize to grow to 4MB. This was the blocksize increase compromise that segwit introduced. Basically saying that we'll allow the blocksize to grow, but only if users upgrade to more efficient transaction types.
With pure segwit transactions, we would have an average of 1.7 MB. OP is saying that with Schnorr, that average could rise to 3.8 MB, because these are even more efficient. In Segwit2x, that would double to 7.6 MB.
This is where the problem is. There's still plenty of people who objected to the Segwit bump to 4MBs, because extra bandwidth and processor requirements threaten decentralization. The incentive structure for more efficient transactions was what made the increase palatable. Also, the main research done on the matter suggests that 4MB is the maximum safe blocksize without killing to many nodes. Segwit2x's 8MB limit is WAY beyond the state of community consensus right now, which is why it's so hotly contested and rejected by the Core development community. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:58:26
Ignoring the EDA issue, it's an altcoin because it changed the consensus rules without achieving consensus.
Bitcoin is whatever the super-majority of the community says it is. You don't get to change the rules without pretty much everyone agreeing to it. If no one agrees, you default to the status quo.
That's why segwit succeeded, 2x failed, and BCH is an altcoin.

If you read the details here,  the final step is that once we've squeezed every drop of efficiency we can, with things like segwit, schnorr, etc, only then will core push for blocksize increases. 
Seems super reasonable to me. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:16:03
I understand what you're implying, but for newbies, you just come across as a shithead calling people names. Why not post some evidence to that effect and actually inform people of your theory. 
Also, spook is not very commonly used slang for spy anymore, especially for non native speakers.
For those unaware, Gavin is the one in the green shirt, a very early contributor to bitcoin, a supporter of BU, and there is a conspiracy theory that he is working for the CIA to destroy bitcoin (as far as I can tell, because he visited them once in 2011).

That wonderful world of low fees was subsidized by inflation and only technically possible because of extremely low usage. Can you tell me what the blocksize would have to be to scale that world to 7 billion people? How much would it cost to run a full node? What if you also want billions of machines doing trillions of micropayments? 
LN is likely to give us that world again, except truly scalable, makes 0-conf a feature and not a statistical risk, and possibly provides a monetary incentive for running a fully node. 
Segwit moves us toward this future. Focusing on just increasing the blocksize is clinging to an old world that was never going to last. Not to mention the fact that segwit is a blocksize increase.

"Past performance is no guarantee of future results."
There are physical limits in the universe. I for one want to be conservative to make sure that our money doesn't hit the shitter because we mis-predicted our ability to scale. I do think you're right that it COULD scale on chain, but at the expense of giving up control to a small oligarchy of powerful individuals and groups. I for one consider this an unacceptable tradeoff. 
I also don't understand the argument that segwit is bad because it aligns with Blockstream's business model. So what? EC aligns with the big miner's business model. The real question is whether they put the cart before the horse and are designing a technical solution for a non-existent problem, or there already existed a problem and they realized there was a business opportunity in the solution. Why is it more believable that miners aren't forcing a broken solution to preserve their business model? 
Everything I've seen has pointed to the fact that there are very real problems created by pre-maturely increasing the blocksize (quadratic scaling for example [1]) and on chain will never scale to enable everything we want out of bitcoin. Do you have any real evidence against this? 
[1] 
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:45:34
What do you mean by inefficiencies like segwit? Segwit itself does several things that makes on-chain scaling significantly more efficient than it is now. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:09:09
It might be a mix of both.
The block reward (inflation) subsidized free/low-fee transactions by providing miners with compensation out of thin air instead of from the users.
The value increase of each bitcoin (deflation) allowed the block reward to remain valuable enough to compensate for increasing cost of mining. Then again, perhaps it was the other way around, and the value increase allowed mining difficulty to increase. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:06:02
I'm also glad you weren't banned. You added to the conversation by sharing your opinion without being disrespectful or dismissive. We need more of that. 
Lot's of smart people disagree that increasing the blocksize is safe. However, many of arguments against raising blocksize are actually solved by segwit.  My understanding is that the blocksize increase bundled into segwit was itself a compromise that many core developers did not want. How is that not good faith? 
I briefed the paper you linked below,  It does not exactly say that 4MB is safe. It sets 4MB as a maximum safe size such that at least 90% of the existing nodes have the bandwidth to handle it. It does not consider whether these nodes have the disk space, memory, or processing power to validate blocks of that size, so the actual safe size for 90% of the nodes may actually be much smaller. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:15:57
Segwit DOES raise the limit! 
You're also making the assumption that 1MB is too low of an arbitrary limit. Some argue that 1MB is already too high and hurting decentralization.
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:58:36
Ok. So forget about people. Assume no more than 1 billion people will ever use bitcoin. Software can own bitcoin too and there could be use cases for billions of autonomous software agents making trillions of micro transactions every day in the future.
Even with people, what if it turns out to be worthwhile to pay for youtube videos by the second or news story by the article? Even 1 billion people could end up making a billions or trillions of transactions per day in this case. 
Projecting how money moves now onto even a decade from now is terribly shortsighted.

Doing truly anonymous blockchains is SUPER hard and no one really knew how to do it when Bitcoin was invented. The trustless public ledger was revolutionary enough on its own back in 2009. It also tends to require WAY bigger transaction sizes, so it just exacerbates the scaling issue.
As far as I know, there are 3 big altcoins making attempts at anonymity; monero, dash, and zcash. They use different methods of achieving this goal (each with pros and cons), but only monero mandates every transaction be anonymous.

Zero personal information.
In fact, autonomous software running on a computer can create and own a bitcoin wallet without a real person being involved. There are some interesting, pie in the sky ideas about building autonomous software that can buy and sell on it's own.
For example, a self-driving car that owns itself, gets paid to taxi people, and buys power, maintenance, and insurance. If it gets really wealthy, it could even "reproduce" by buying another car and copy it's software to it.

It's not considered extra income. It's considered capital gains, which is taxed differently from income. There is no difference to buying and selling gold from a tax perspective. In your scenario, you'd owe $1300 (capital gains) x 15% (long term capital gains tax) on the increased gold value. Same is true of stocks, bonds, real estate, cryptocurrencies, and even foreign currency. 
This is not a question of ethics. If you neglect to tell the IRS about your profit, then you will be guilty of tax fraud. If they catch you, then you WILL pay a major fine and possibly get prison time. Maybe you manage to move things around in such a way that they won't find out in an audit, but people do this professionally all the time and still get caught (money laundering).
With the amount of money OP has made with bitcoin, not being as honest as possible with taxes would be a profoundly stupid move.

Seems all of those tipping services shutdown. You basically need a centralized service to manage and distribute funds for it to work (unless everyone has and publishes a bitcoin address). Also, on-chain fees increased, so micro tips didn't make as much sense anymore. Guess it wasn't profitable to run. 
I'd guess this sort of thing might come back as popularity grows and LN comes online.

It is confusing, and takes time to really understand since bitcoin relies on a lot of concepts that the vast majority of people have never encountered.
Your wallet can be an app on your phone, software on your desktop, a piece of paper printed out, or a specialized piece of hardware. The one thing they all have in common is that they store a private key which which you can use to prove to the bitcoin network that you own and have the right to transfer some number of bitcoin.
So, 'wallets' would really be more accurately called 'keychains'. One way to think about it, is that the bitcoin network is like a massive wall of lockboxes. So, a transaction would be using your wallet/keychain to open your box, take out some amount of bitcoin, and slip it into someone else's box. Obviously, this is just a simple analogy.
Here's some videos to start getting into more technical details. 
* Simple: 
* Detailed: 
A huge part of the appeal of bitcoin is that you have the ability to be your own bank. If you run your own wallet, then you actually do own your bitcoin, just like you own the cash in your wallet or the gold in your home safe. That means that as long as the network is running, no one can stop you from sending money to whoever you want and no one can steal your money without coercion. If this is important to you, then I'd recommend investing whatever time you need to learn how to keep your wallet secure (backups, cold wallets, hardware wallets, etc). 
In the meantime, I second the Coinbase Vault recommendation. Bear in mind though, that Coinbase is really just a bitcoin bank account, except without FDIC insurance.

You get them either way. It's just that if you own the private keys, you have the option to access your 2x coins immediately. If you leave them Coinbase, you won't have access until they give them to you. 
Coinbase still hasn't given users Bitcoin Cash coins. They plan to do so in January, 5 months after the fork. By that time, the value may have crashed.

What has regulation of the internet accomplished (now or in the future) that's so negative? Government may now have tighter control of the clearnet, but Tor and I2P now exist which effectively makes information completely uncensorable, albeit more difficult to access.

To be clear, this is opinion. There are several technically feasible ways to make bitcoin anonymous that are running in other coins like monero. Whether it is politically feasible or technically desirable is not so obvious.
I tend to agree that bitcoin will never be anonymous at the L1 protocol level. However, I think that anonymity and fungibility most likely can be built up in higher layers.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:31:21
The Trezor team would need to update their software for both wallets to show up. Both Trezor and Ledger had updates ready day of the fork for Bitcoin Cash. KeepKey took about a month to add support. 
Regardless, if you have a hardware wallet, you have your backup words which you can import into another wallet to claim your 2x coins. This is somewhat technically complicated, so I'd recommend waiting for Trezor support. Either way, there will be guides written closer to the fork.

No. You keep your coins off the exchange because there's several historical examples of big exchanges getting hacked and people loosing huge amounts of money.
On the other hand, there's plenty of examples of people loosing tons of bitcoin holding their own keys.
If your government bans bitcoin, holding your keys is necessary, but not sufficient to keep your coins. You'd also need to have acquired them anonymously (e.g. buying from someone in person with cash, not through coinbase). You'd also be blatantly breaking the law and taking on the risk of getting caught.

Why would an AI waste cycles on mining when specialized dumb hardware will always be better?
But mining's not important here. The key "holy shit" realization is the simple fact that an AI (or even any simple program) can own, spend, and receive money. Like seriously. Holy shit. A program can, today, own money in EXACTLY the same way people do. No exceptions. No legal cartwheels. No political debates. If a program can secure a private key and has access to the web, it can own and transfer wealth. 
And you don't even need to go all the way to highly advanced AI. Imagine a bitcoin-operated laundromat where each machine has it's own wallet to receive funds, which it uses to pay for it's water, electricity, maintenance, and "rent". At that point (barring legal issues) the machine might even be able to own itself. Maybe it even competes on price with other machines or pays a mover to take it to another laundromat that it can rent space in with promise of better pay. Provided the structure is there for the program to interact with the services it needs to consume, a relatively simple program could probably handle this. No AI. 
Another good example is self owning cars, which Andreas explains here. 
Point is, bitcoin isn't food for AI. Electricity is. Bitcoin is money for AI, like bitcoin is money for Humans. It's an abstract unit of account that can be used to exchange things it produces for things it consumes. But, unlike traditional fiat, bitcoin won't take years of legal debate and political games for an AI to be recognized as a person who can hold a bank account. An AI can own bitcoin today, and there's really not much anyone can do to stop that.
This still blows my mind...

Wow. This might kill Youtube and Netflix. And Spotify and Itunes. This could be the internet of media. In the same way that bitcoin could turn into the backbone of all financial transactions that anyone can interface with, bittorrent married with bitcoin could become the backbone of all media dissemination. 
If we develop a good way for creators to get payed, they could release their content into bittorrent for anyone to download, and higher layer services could 1) act as light wrappers around it with search and discovery, or 2) act as a heavy service built on top of it that provides more complicated, centralized service (similar to how coinbase or circle operate). Then every single one of these clients has access to the same media that everyone else has and suddenly they need to compete by provide the best experience for the user, rather than being the only place you can get the content.

The more I think about it, the more incredible and groundbreaking this seems. When every piece of hardware and software has the ability to transfer money, our entire concept of how we do everything changes. We're only beginning to imagine the possibilities. Even the few simple ones I've been thinking of make my head spin. 
Bitcoin as a human currency is exciting. Creates a more open system, breaks monopoly, gives you the option of true, non-revocable ownership. All great stuff. 
But it's these revolutionary ideas that make me believe that Bitcoin, or a successor very much like it, will take over the world. As someone invested in bitcoin, I'd like to see it succeed and my investment pay off, but goddamn will this be an exciting ride regardless. 
At this point, I'm seriously thinking of buying and developing on it. The potential here is lightyears beyond what most people are thinking.

Thank you for the great work you are doing. It seems like the direction you are going is really what will make bitcoin the ubiquitous protocol for value transfer and kill all existing walled gardens. 
Circle is really the first app I've come across that I feel I can recommend to friends and family without feeling like a bitcoin shill. And it's simple enough that my mother and grandmother could both use it and readily see the value of it. 
However, one huge area of improvement that needs to happen is identity management. Raw bitcoin addresses and QR codes probably aren't the best solution. Even a simple address book in Circle would go a long way if you repeatedly make payments to the same people. Any chance you can talk about your plans in this area?
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:34:04
Is it just me, or does it seem like the mining aspect is really a distraction here. So long as there is money on the table, large, highly efficient datacenter miners will always be more efficient that any micro-miner. Even if the price skyrockets and these guys start making tens of dollars a day for negligible electricity, hashrate will increase and the "market" will correct back to only the most efficient miners being able to profit. 
So mining's not what's exciting. What's exciting is a programmable device with an integrated hardware wallet. This is the genesis of the self-owning car, the internet of things that can own wealth and exchange value without any human involvement. 
Here's a theory for the Cisco partnership. Imagine a datacenter of network switches that have one of these installed. These devices could then get paid for their service, maybe based on how much bandwidth they successfully route. Then they pay for their electricity cost. Any device that gets too far into debt would be "killed". Any device that accumulates enough wealth could "reproduce" by ordering more of itself or copying it's software to one of the "dead" switches. 
Hell, this could be an incredibly method for testing new software or hardware in decentralized systems. Even letting the software randomly or intelligently iterate on itself and evolve to reach peak efficiency in a fully autonomous way, while in a production environment creating real value. 
Granted, bitcoin might not be the best answer for the datacenter example, where there is no interaction outside world. Self-owning taxies are better. Maybe EC2 servers that generate incoming by direct payment in bitcoin from external customers and pay for rental space in a rack along with electricity and maintenance costs. You then have dynamic server capacity management based on actual consumer demand.
This idea is shamelessly stolen from this video of Andreas talking about self-owning cars, whom I believe stole it from someone else.

From what I'm reading on their website, mining is only a small component of what they're selling. Their entire pitch seems to be IoT and software and hardware that sell goods and services. I would really treat this as a dev kit. It offers a little bit of everything that bitcoin offers for the sake of alpha level experimentation. I suspect that the integrated miner will turn out to be relatively useless and dropped from later versions, but I could be wrong. Certainly future versions will have wallet or full node only options.

Peer to peer payments. It's not uncommon to want to collaborate with friends to pay for something, but nobody carries cash. Credit/debit cards fail here. 
The Square Cash app is doing something very similar to Circle, except that it is a closed system. Circle is special because it enables p2p payments through a debit card, but plugs directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem, so it integrates with every other bitcoin payment app in existence. This is really the beauty of using bitcoin as the engine of a p2p payment app. Literally anybody can write their own app and immediately have the advantage of being a part of a huge network rather than trying to build it up from scratch.

The author from the comments, "In the future the client could look for a signature on the torrent which validates that an embedded payment address corresponds to the legal owner of the content." If this could actually be used to reward both seeders for bandwidth and content creators, this just might be bitcoin's killer app. 
I could really see this going two ways. 
1) You'd end up with true piracy with people profiting off stolen content, which only increase the drive for bittorrent to be shutdown. I don't think that's an impossibility with enough money on the table. 
2) It could blow open the doors for content creators to profit on bittorrent. Holy shit, this could kill/decentralize youtube and other content hosts/aggregators. What the hell is the point of youtube if content creators and seeders can profit on a distributed network with no ads?
Obviously there are a couple of problems with 2. Most importantly, how could you verify the seed is from the real creator? Youtube has the same problem, but at least the centralized system allows contesting theft. That's a much harder problem to solve and really depends on a solid, decentralized identity management system, which we still haven't fully figured out. It might be partially solved by companies that provide "good" clients that try to fight piracy. If the majority use these, you might be able to ignore the small amount of piracy. 
So long as micro payments scale and we work out a solid way to reward creators and fight piracy, this could end up being incredible.

It sounds like nothing more than centralized off chain transactions, which 21 is already doing.

True. It's possible for some kind of non-person, legal entity to operate today. None of them operate without humans directing and running run though. Could an entity like the Getty Foundation eventually become some kind of self-owning AI? Probably. But honestly, that isn't the most exciting development.
What is exciting is a sea of micro-entities, that take very little, if any human effort to start up. Maybe even entities that can create "children" if they are economically successful enough. See the video above for an example of how a self owning car that has highly successful or efficient hardware/software might reproduce by saving money, buying a new car, and gifting it it's programming (or a slight variation of). 
I'm just realizing reading about 21's new product. This is what it's meant for. The mining aspect is a distraction. Micro-mining will never be as efficient as datacenter mining. Even if the price skyrockets, the hashrate will respond and increase until there's no money on the table. But a device with an integrated hardware wallet that can transact on the blockchain?

Probably because many people here are purists who hate the idea of providing any sort compromise features designed to help encourage newbies feel comfortable getting into bitcoin. Same people who hate on Circle downplaying bitcoin to the backend value store, even though Circle is literally the only app I know of that my mother could use and possibly find useful.

I can't prove that he does not, but as far as I know, he's never claimed to be anything other than a businessman and an investor. We do know that he does not have any technical degree and most likely would not be capable of writing code to the level of quality required by the core devs.

Actually, it originates from a drunken typo, not an acronym.

You can have intermediaries and still be trustless and permissionless. Can you explain why you think it's bad?

It really sounds like you don't understand LN. There is no service provider like Paypal or VISA that has control over your money. At no point are you ever not in full control. It's a decentralized system for making transactions off chain through a network of payment channels. It still uses all the fancy crypto and private keys that make bitcoin trustless and secure. 
The reason we need it is because blockchain transactions can't possibly scale to accommodate becoming a global currency. This criticism was literally in the very first comment when Satoshi released the whitepaper, and it's still a problem. Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second, while VISA can handle 50,000. We would need gigabyte or even terabyte sized blocks to get there, and THAT would certainly centralize and kill the bitcoin we love. That's not even considering micro/nano transactions of value of cents or fractions of cents that could revolutionize how we pay for various things. 
Here's a 5 minute video that gives a really brief rundown for how LN works,

Very fake.
If it was true, you can be damn sure you wouldn't be hearing about it first from a random customer support conversation.

It's not simple, but worth understanding. Here's a start, 
There's lots of other videos and articles that attempt to explain.

For all the hype of OpenDime, it really seems like a fundamentally flawed concept.
Here's how a malicious actor profits and destroys anyone's ability to trust accepting an OpenDime in a trade, at least for large values.
1. Build a counterfeit OpenDime that operates exactly like the real thing, except that I initialize it with a private key I own. Add some amount of bitcoin. 
2. Trade the OpenDime with someone. They validate that, yes, it owns some amount of bticoin, and yes, the physical seal has not been broken. 
3. They trade it with many other people. 
4. The counterfeiter eventually uses their private key to move the coins back into their control. 
I could really only see these being useful for small value transfers where blockchain fees make it too expensive/slow to move, e.g. &lt; $5 worth. Anything more would probably require as much centralized governance to fight counterfeiting as we have now for fiat cash.
There may be ways to make it work, but we're a long way before I don't immediately transfer large values to a key I know only I control, which of course completely negates the value proposition. We also have a long way to go before these are usable for small values, since each stick currently costs ~$12.

Which solutions is he trying to profit from? More specifically, how is he going to profit?

Looks like the 3d spheres may be to scale, which is still a terrible way to convey the difference.

LN also exists in testnet now. It's just blocked because it requires a malleability fix, e.g. segwit.

Not quite. What you described are payment channels, which are limited to payments between 2 parties. However, this is the primitive LN is based on. 
LN is a network of payment channels. So, both wallet holders will already have channels open to some intermediary LN node, and those nodes will have channels open between each other. Alice can send payments through her LN node middle man, which routes the payment to Bob's LN middle man, which routes the payment to Bob.
The magic of LN is that you can do this without trusting the middle men. If anyone in the chain tries to cheat and steal, you can detect it and safely close the channel. It means that people can open a single channel and use it to trade value trustlessly with anyone else on the network with 2 total blockchain transactions (open/close). And as long as no one in the chain cheats, you can make as many transactions as you want!
