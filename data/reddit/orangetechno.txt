The tone of you response is what is wrong with the bitcoin community, if you address me like this and I'm on your side then god knows how you discuss with people who think EC is the right scaling solution. 
My only answer is read the whitepaper again and dont give me this BS about it not being a political move, BIP148 forces miners to accept segwit and changes the status quo of signalling since bitcoin inception. Now I'm not saying this is inherently bad but following through with 10% of nodes signalling for BIP148 is bound to create caos and possibly a chain split.
P.S. send this article to a friend of yours getting into bitcoin, or a company considering accepting bitcoin, then message me the answer.
have a good day

I like segwit and all but this is the absolute worst way of doing it. I understand that its a political move, however it will scare away most of the recent newbs and bitcoin will get bad pubblicity pushing mainstream adoption further back. I really think this is a bluff but indeed a dangerous one.

O look, some of the most relevant brains in core think that bip148 is risky and rushed with little support by the 'community'. Next time, give your opinions in a more moderate way so that you don't appear so ignorant and arrogant when criticising other peoples opinions.

There is a big difference between being technically able, which they undeniably are, and having some degree of bias/being driven by self interest. Besides my point was that I commented on the riskiness of bip148 and I got an arrogant response as if I had preached blasphemy. Turns out that moderating your comments not only helps healthy discussion but also prevents you from looking like an out right idiot when it turns out the original opinion is shared by a lot of the people who created segwit.
