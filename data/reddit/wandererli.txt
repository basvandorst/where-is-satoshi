To be fair, I think in 2017 people were trying to mine bitcoin with Xbox’s so....

As a person who is currently navigating the regulatory waters of traditional currency, I want so much for the world to believe in bitcoin. It’s just so much easier. But if all that regulation just comes flooding into bitcoin, too, then... it’s not bitcoin anymore.

What’s the point of this subreddit? 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:28:19
There are many answers, but we can probably provide a more accurate one if you offer more context. One common way that people steal bitcoin keys is by copying your private key if you store it somewhere on your computer. Writing a program to find it is not hard, and it can be installed just like any virus. Anyway, it’s just speculation—like I said, without details we can’t really give you a sure answer.

Worthyt ( is a Chrome Extension that a few friends and I made that adds a tipping button to content on Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, and Wikipedia (more to come!). You can send micro tips with Bitcoin. I just sent $5 in BTC to this post! 
Also accepts USD (the goal is to let people who don't use crypto to use this to, and at some point someone may tip them with BTC or ETH or something, and bam! More adoption).

I had an advertisement disapproved on Facebook today due to mentioning cryptocurrency. They said I can apply for an exception as a company and the form asked for lots of (optional) evidence of compliance and regulations for review. They are opening the gates but it’s more like a dam than a flood. I think it’s a good thing. My app isn’t a scam or anything... it’s a tipping system that uses money or crypto.

I've clarified this in another post and I'll add it here as well because the title is very misleading:


@_date: 2018-06-28 22:07:15
The article talks about a verified vulnerability in USDT, not that traders are using this exploit. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:35:08
Got it, sorry I only skimmed it. Thanks for the clarification, comment deleted
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:52:02
Got it. I suspected it but just didn’t believe it considering how transparently they seem to operate (their entire team and profile is available)—that’s pretty brave. Willingly facilitating this level of fraud is a serious offense... especially if it gets into money laundering territory.

Without modern graphics cards that have dedicated memory you won’t even be able to mine altcoins—profitably, at least. You could join a mining pool, but your utilities for keeping your devices running will probably cancel out if not cost more than what you make.

Sorry, I can't answer that for certain.

Yea I think with 5% the entire value proposition for legitimate use crumbles because that's what you get in rewards for using the Amazon credit card on Amazon products anyway. That, combined with an Amazon Affiliate link, means that they're able to make money on each purchase. But they won't pass the Affiliate savings on, so it makes no difference for a legitimate user to use them over just their own Amazon card. At least, that's what I'm understanding just from my limited perspective.
I didn't know that it was funded by Ver with an ulterior motive. I haven't actually purchased anything on the website so I haven't seen much BCH promotion. To be fair to Purse, though, I noticed now that its referral program pays out in BTC and the default payment method is also BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:11:50
To clarify, BCH wasn't just released, it's been around for several months now. It's just gotten popular as an alternative to BTC after SegWit2x got axed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:40:33
This. Worst case scenario, BCH drops back to pre-segwit2x-cancellation days, and you'll have free money. Otherwise, BCH increases in value because its fork has successfully pushed miners over, in which case in January you'll be writing another post about how much you love Coinbase for not releasing BCH during this time hahaah
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:32:05
Okay sorry that sounded too ominous, BTC and BCH and head-to-head right now for miners, and whichever is more profitable to mine will get the miners and all the transaction speeds/lower fees that come with that surplus. 
BCH is about to launch a hard fork in less than an hour. Unsure at this point whether or not the fork will result in BCH being more lucrative; if so, there's a high chance that BTC fees will only rise. The fees were anywhere between 20-100 just 24 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:30:37
It's either going to settle at around 2-10 or skyrocket. In less than an hour, its fate will be triggered. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:23:05

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:10:28
Hey it's because there is so much congestion on BTC right now. Don't worry if you can see it as a pending transaction it's just a waiting game. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:40
You can wait if you want, but there's no guarantee that fees will come down. But you can at least rest assured knowing that it'll either come down or skyrocket. ;)
All depends on what goes on with the miners after the upcoming BCH hardfork in less than one hour.

Thanks a lot. Can you also tell me if you see bitcoin ever getting to 1700 tps? I’m wondering if it can get there itself because I’m reading about this company taking the idea of a CDN and applying it to blockchain so that the p2p propagation doesn’t have to go through multiple peers, just through a node in the CDN. By increasing the block size and reducing the hops it takes to fully propagate the network, it sounds like network propagation speeds will be solved with this idea. But from your statements, it sounds like you see bitcoin hitting that 1700 tps mark without the need for such technology?
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:06:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:40:01
Yes to... 2mb = 2x transactions for Segwit?
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:03:36
Gotcha; then what's the problem with orphan blocks? Wasted hashing power?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:48:13
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:35:42
So if the block size is 4MB right now, and the average transaction is around 380MB, then that's about 11,000 transactions per block at max capacity, with a block gen time of ten minutes, then it's around 18 TPS theoretical? But everywhere I read, it says around 4-7 TPS -- is that old news?
Can you provide some examples of the block propagation speed improvements? I'm asking because I am reading up on this company called bloXroute that is building out a CDN but specifically for the blockchain space -- so instead of content, they transmit blocks still on-chain but it reduces the amount of hops that blocks have to go through to propagate the entire network, reducing the block propagation time.

A cryptocurrency fund making bullish claims to attract uninformed investors? Must be honest truth, since these Sarson guys said it. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:53:38
So it doesn’t require any additional action on my part for the other person to get the $2? I thought I have to sign too?
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:50:11
Thanks for the clarification -- also, I understand it's a multisig transaction to close the payment network and finally receive the amount of Bitcoin, but what's the actually stop one of the participants from signing the tx? For example, if I pay for coffee on LN and then I get my coffee and then days later I just decide not to sign off--even though I will never be able to get my $2 back, I just don't care enough to go in to close the payment network, which hands over the $2?
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:35:49
Thanks! The kit.edu one is great. The bitcoinstats one seems to drop off at 2017. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:55:53
Gotcha so you don’t necessarily need both parties to close the channel and receive payment. That’s super helpful thanks for the clarification.

“We will need to see at least a second impulsive upward movement”
I don’t understand why impulsive movements dictate the fate of Bitcoin’s price. The two market orders that happened over the weekend are hard to be attributed to a shift in trader sentiment. 
If anything, I think the more likely story is that one or some institutional investors bought cryptocurrency on coinbase to participate in coinbase’s just-released institutional portfolio, and the natural chain reaction due to the bitcoin peg led to an overall higher market cap.
