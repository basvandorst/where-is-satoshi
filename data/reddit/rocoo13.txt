Hi, it turns out it was an error on the recipient end, they didn't go into what the problem was but i'm just happy not to have lost my money. Thanks for all your help in getting to bottom of the problem &amp; for your help in understanding the bitcoin/blockchain process, all the best.

 i see,  i think i may not have had enough money in my local bit coins wallet for the fee, i added more money today to cover the fee, do you think this could poss be the reason?  thanks again for your help
