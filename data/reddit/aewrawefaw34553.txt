This is the bitcoin whitepaper. Read it. Read it again. Read it once more. Then read it again, just to be sure you grok it. 
This may be more specifically what you're looking for:

This was previously posted. It doesn't sound very promising.

I want downvotes!

I wish this weren't spam and we could give that 0.05 BTC to this effort. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 12:33:58
It may not be bitcoin (though its very likely it will), but the currency of tomorrow will be cryptocurrency. Anyone who is against using cryptocurrencies is fundamentally against freedom. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:18:28
The scary part is that they do impact the entire world. AMURICA!

I hope you have a happy and fruitful life. May you have all the best!

Tip in doge. Not a serious suggestion, btw. Just dont support Changetip, at all. 
You could have asked Zamicol for a donation address. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:09:15
Good point.

Our version of capitalism I suppose. Pure capitalism driven entirely by the free market is not necessarily in favor of the wealthy. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:09:41
Good point. Paypal could still service this need. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:37:55


what they failed to do was to go for clean interface and real names which [apparently their users wanted] 
You are seriously going to disagree with me and then go on to completely validate my point? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:34:32
Government ban? Pssssh. Satoshi don't care!
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:56:46
Yes, you can still lose your money if blockchain.info is compromised. They take many precautions and have designed their entire wallet system to prevent this from happening. But with that said, it IS still possible. 
Do some research about how and why this could happen. It will teach you a lot about how bitcoin works "under the hood". 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:43:25
Bet. I'm in. 
Notice how you've yet to make a sentient argument. Well, except for "sigh". That was very poignant. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:05:23
What legislation gets mandated is determined by the wealthy. The wealthy are not going to support legislation that works against their interests. Therefore the legislation is biased in their favor. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:31:50
FederalCoin actually.

Import the private key from your paper wallet into Mycelium.
 
Command Mycelium to transfer funds from your address to your Coinbase account address. 
Instruct Coinbase to sell your coins for fiat, and wait for your bank/coinbase to make it happen.

Real money is whatever society collectively decides it is. Please do some research on the subject and try to understand this fundamental concept. You will gain so much from it. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:31:21
Bitcoin currently massively benefits from the network effect. Unless it messes up in a major way, bitcoin is not going anywhere. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:20:53


There are many hidden costs to relying on fiat currency. Primarily, you do not own your money. The government can take it away at will. You are permanently in a Mt. Gox situation (if this analogy helps you), in that you only have IOU's and not any real currency. 
Also, credit card processors charge vendors large fees to process their transactions. This cost is typically passed on to you, the consumer.

I was asking for downvotes from the roving downvote bot(s). Been a whole minute and nothing yet! I guess I am lucky. I clicked a new post at random to make my test comment. Sorry that it was yours. 
I gave you an upvote. And your submission one too! It is pretty funny, but the image could be a tad more polished. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:54:33


Haha. This is the funniest thing I have read today

Use [memwallet.info]( and quit futzing around with shitty brain wallets. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:19:22
You do realize that those "wealthy", early adopters will have to spend their bitcoins on actual goods and services right? In doing this, they will lose bitcoins and others will gain them. Then, if they do useful work, they can gain those back. If not, they will lose their "wealth" quite quickly. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:18:59
Hey! Don't you try to doge the question!
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:02:48
That is fair to say. 
However, predicting the future based on observed trends does not immediately jump out as irrational. But, perhaps in the world of commodity trading this concept does not hold water. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:20:09
What happened to getting out of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:24:18
Take them hunting instead. Then they can learn about how the world works instead of contributing to animal cruelty. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:35:11
Well you would still be selling them. Just for goods/services, not fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:02:39
Yay! I got some. But I don't think they're from the bot. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:34:00


There is a mechanism by which the supply "somehow stops" built right into the protocol. You are aware of this right? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:12:46
Bitcoin provides actual value. More people are realizing this. Thus, the price will increase. 
Short-term volatility is based on emotional people. 
Long-term trends are based on the merit of the commodity. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:06:22
You're one of the good ones :) Thanks for fighting the good fight.

Lots of distributing hashing power is necessary to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack.

The number of meaningful cryptos is much less. A handful, tops. I'd say there is only one crypto, currently, with any meaningful market-cap and hashing power. Can you guess which one that is? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:29:33
Scrape or use Coinbase, bitpay or whatever's API. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:47:24
Thanks!

They messed up. If myspace did not cause their userbase to hate them, they would still be dominating and facebook would have never risen up. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:53:32
Them launching bitcoin into mainstream acceptance will mark the beginning of their demise. People will quickly realize that a payment mediator like Paypal is useless in the bitcoin environment. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:15:26
Bitcoin does not need PayPal. If PayPal tries to use bitcoin, bitcoin will absorb and destroy it.

He made statements and did not support them. His points could be considered "reasonable" maybe, but not rational.

I could transfer control of the current address to someone who is more trusted around here. It only has a few cents in it right now, but I'll do anything to prove trust.

You did not use changetip correctly. You also used changetip so shame on you. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:05:51


1-1000 and 1000-1000000 have the same increase in order of magnitude. So in fact the jump from 1-1000 is a change of 3 orders of magnitude, while the jump from 1000 to 127,000 is only two. 
Yes, orders of magnitude matter. You should work hard to understand them.  


I'm starting to think you are not capable of explaining this. 


Just think for a second about how little meaning this statement has. 
EDIT: I'm still upvoting you btw. I want everyone to see both sides of this argument. You know, just in case you pull a rational argument out of your sleeve.

This I must absolutely agree with. 


Update pings, as in downloaded clients checking a central server for updates? I do appreciate this figure though, thanks for sharing it. I would never have imagined Multibit would have so many users. Though that metric (if I understand it correctly) does not really give a great idea of how many people are actively using Multibit. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:54:36
Yes. Your meat brain and your ethereal brain,

Please do us all a favor and explain why you believe that "anyone who would believe that is functionally retarded".

The end game is to do all transactions in bitcoin. What fuels your attraction to fiat currency?

They are not difficult to get a hold of.

Thank you for the fast response! 


I will obviously retract this statement. 
Again, thanks for the facts!

Your google-fu is weak.

The rich get richer through biased financial legislation that favors them over everyone else. They have the most, and and proportionately give the least. Anonymous corporate political donations are fully legal. Think about how that affects any legislation that could hinder the wealthy. 
You have a lot to learn about the difference between how the world works and how you imagine it does. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:54:40


That one actually makes sense in this context. Good work!
