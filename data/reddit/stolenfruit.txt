What a great idea!  When people say that just tipping a few cents isn't worth it I disagree. A few cents is a few cents and a nice gesture. Also when the price of btc goes up so will the few pennies you got tipped a while back. So if it goes up 1000 times, all those pennies will now be dollars. So a penny is a penny now, but latter it could be much more!  100 bits  @_date: 2014-11-06 22:45:40

I think of it as giving a lottery ticket to a friend and keeping one for your self (like powerball with the same numbers). It can make them and you happy. It is also no different then the USD. The dollar can go up and down but that doesn't make you want to spend it all at once or keep it for it to mature.

Coinbase.com is a pretty reputable website. The only downfall is that you have to link your bank account. There is also trucoin.com that let's you buy with a debit card. That's great that you want to except btc for a charity. Hopefully that helps spread awareness (for the charity and btc)!

There's a website called changetip which you can store some bitcoin in. You link your account to reddit (and other social media) and tip people for whatever reason you want. You can create a account to collect and withdrawal tips into you other wallets, or tip other people by mentioning the amount like "50 bits" and tag the bot. Cheers!

They add up quickly. If you get a $3 tip it could turn into $9 if BTC triples. Just think of all the people tips inspired to buy Bitcoin and they could be sitting on a big pile of money if it gets a popular as many of us hope it does.
