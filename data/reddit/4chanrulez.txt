Could you explain why you wouldn't keep your bitcoin in breadwallet? From what I've read it's the preferred wallet in this sub, but then I haven't read anything about wallet security.  Are ledger or tremor free? what makes them safer?

I'm all for spreading risk around, I have a sliver of knowledge about MPT and how you want to hedge your risks. So here is my plan: 
buy the first half off of Gemini with a CC on 7/31, instantly transferring it to my bread wallet, then 
buy the second half with Gemini on 8/1 with a bank transfer (since time isn't a factor with the second purchase) and eventually transfer it to my bread wallet.
...What is a fiat?

So what you're saying is I don't have the equipment to handle the upcoming hard fork?  I will look up the youtube vids to try to figure this out.  I'm not really trying to make money in the bitcoin market, I just want to buy some stuff from a vendor who only takes bitcoin.

Interesting. I'm actually getting into bitcoin not as an investor, and I'm really not trying to make money. I just want to buy some stuff and the vendor I want to buy from only takes bitcoin, so I am not really looking at this as a method to make money.
But maybe I will now.

So if I were to buy $300 worth of bitcoin from coinbase, I would then need to transfer it to my bread wallet? I've read coin base's exchange GDAX has withdrawn limits, would I still be able to transfer $300 by the end of 7/31/17?
Is there a better way to buy bitcoins? From what I've read my best option is Coinbase, but if there is a better option I'm all for it.

Clever on the car part.  So you can keep non bitcoin money in your wallet? or would the fiat have to be stored in an exchange account?
