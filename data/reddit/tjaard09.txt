Yep, I think it's a ponzi coin tbh

You pay fees with coins in your wallet on exchange and you get a discount, it requires no action other than holding coins on the exchange.

Some exchanges also require a minimum trading volume to continue to be listed, so companies are paying other companies to run bots and maintain a certain level of liquidity and volume on each exchange. Since BTC has the most trading pairs, this should at least cover some of that volume.

your first use case, there is a startup trying to do this with AI/machine vision (without crypto payments)

You can do this more securely with secure remote password protocol (essentially a zero knowledge password proof) and end to end encryption with their email + password. Sending plaintext mnemonics to your server is ridiculous. The threat vector becomes brute forcing the end to end encrypted mnemonic looking for their password which allows more paranoid users to use 30+ char passwords which makes it effectively impossible for anyone to brute force it.

I think he means a phone with keys being stored in hardware instead of on the filesystem like how iPhones have the disk encryption key stored in hardware. Can you imagine 20% of population using crypto on their smartphones? It would be a massive target for zero day exploits.

If the private keys are not stored in hardware, they need to be stored somewhere, that somewhere is on the onboard memory next to all your apps. The only thing protecting it from being stolen is the operating system. If there is an exploit to gain root access or bypass those protections then the keys can be stolen. If the keys are stored in hardware then the hardware can prevent direct access to the keys by only providing access through apis to sign transactions. You can then do things that tie in directly to that secure hardware, maybe a hardware overlay in the lcd panel that asks you to sign a transaction. It means that the operating system cannot sign transactions without physically touching the lcd panel and the software doesn't have access at all to the keys so they cannot be stolen.
  
Read up on the apple secure enclave and how it holds encryption keys to decrypt the disk.
