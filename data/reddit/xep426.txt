A mesh network is indeed decentralized. However Bitcoin is decentralized as well. A system is centralized if it has exactly *one* process/computer/server which facilitates some sort of function for many clients.
Bitcoin is not centralized, therefore it is decentralized. Any system with more than one server is decentralized. However, the point of contention isn't whether bitcoin is decentralized or not, it's to what degree Bitcoin is decentralized.
If you're running a full node you are participating in a [distributed consensus algorithm]( that determines the state of the blockchain. I'd argue that's as decentralized as you can get. The only caveat is the distribution of nodes that actually perform POW. If only one entity were to be left mining you could argue that that's just centralization with extra steps.

No clue how these foldingcoins work but they are quite obviously not endorsed by folding Tacked on solutions will never be worth while talking about.

Unless there's an actual implementation flaw in SHA256 even quantum computers will never be able to take your bitcoin because public keys in bitcoin are actually double hashed ECC public keys. Once quantum computers can crack ECC Bitcoin will have to:
Either upgrade its signature algorithm along with everyone else in the world that relies on current cryptographic algorithms.
If there are no QC-proof signature algorithms... burn along side everyone else in the world that relies on current cryptographic algorithms.
I envision miners creating open channels for refugee bitcoiners that have to privately transmit their legacy transactions directly to miners without broadcasting them on the network. It will be a disruption but not the end of Bitcoin.
Edit: SHA256 irreversibly maps an input to a value that is larger than the known number of atoms in the universe. QC won't help finding the preimage of a SHA256 output.

If you could combine something like Folding with Bitcoin's POW algorithm you'd primarily be mining bitcoin while directing computational power to something useful ("research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer").
You can't monetize the folding process because there is no one that will pay you for it.


The point of "making pow useful" is for *all* miners to perform the useful task. That is a prerequisite. Payouts (if they exist) have to be made across the entire mining network. That renders your 51% attack scenario moot.
I don't see anything inherently wrong with the concept. However, coming up with a functioning implementation isn't easy. Convincing people that Bitcoin needs such a gimmic? That will be impossible.

"Best custodians" is quite the oxymoron.

Being able to reference an array of inputs  \[(pk,value)\] in the locking script would be really neat. Along with being able to asign btc to utxos from within the script.

Yes, fees and governmental approval. Or at least no embargo and my banks permission. And ofc the native surveillance that comes baked into plastic cards.

I don't even know whether it requires a full node or whether it might also work without one. I just happened to have bitcoind running at the time I installed Bisq. I feel like running a full node is already an insurmountable obstacle for more than 90% of the users. People really need to DTOR. Though honestly it doesn't take much aside from starting the software and clicking "next" while reading the instructions.

You can lie about receiving the payment but you won't get your security deposit (in my case 65% of the traded btc amount) back until the dispute is resolved. You can request arbitration in case of a dispute and since the payment info of both parties is hard coded into the trade contract it is quite easy to prove to the arbiter that a payment has been made. You are actually instructed not to accept incoming fiat payments that diverge from the provided details and immediately open a dispute if that should occur.

Well depending on the payment method there might be the issue of post trade chargebacks (When selling BTC). Currently SEPA seems very attractive considering the high opsec requirements the EU is imposing on back transfers (eg. PhotoTAN, 2FA for all money transfers). Unfortunately there is no perfect solution. Though generally speaking I would have less of a trust issue with purchasing BTC (+large deposit from the counter party) than selling BTC.

What's the fastest way to lose all your bitcoin? Buy something in Puerto Banus.

So basically this is an unfounded claim that these companies operate Ponzi schemes. I get not liking the particular business model and I would never use it myself. But when you're basically accusing someone of fraud I'd expect some proof.
Also "reputable bitcoin exchange" is quite the oxymoron. Not being able to withdraw is a great security feature for people that leave their Bitcoin on exchanges to day trade anyway. After all, if no one can withdraw bitcoin, the exchange doesn't have to expose hot wallets to hackers on the web.

As they should. I accepted a trade that required me to make a multisig deposit significantly larger than my counter party. That did feel like a small leap of faith.
BTW I don't want to misconstrue my single success as an universal endorsement of Bisq. I might have gotten  to excited to get that point across properly.

Lucky for me I don't live in China and don't have to fear my social credit score taking a hit.

I have it on good authority that "Bitcoin" simply translates to "Bitcoin" in german... Nevertheless I somehow want a tshirt with "Neine theine keyinas, Neine theine Bitcöineu!" printed on it.

That does sound like a potential problem. Though I'd also assume that it's more likely to occur if you suddenly receive 150k USD rather than 50USD here and there.

Nothing to see here. Just a binary tree upside down. No hash present.

I was an inch from clicking that link. Just out of curiosity to find out whether they managed to sneak in some EU bashing into this article too.

Who said I only considered data from 2017 onwards? That's when I started looking at it. The data goes back to 2009.

Damn you're right. That is pretty awesome :D

Yep, got into Bitcoin back in 2013 and only ever made one prediction: Bitcoin will be worth either a lot or nothing. Coming up on a decade of being right without any indication of that changing. The only chart I've been looking at since 2017 has been volatility over time and that has been developing satisfactory as well.
All I can say in summary is that not everyone here fomoed in at 20k.

I downloaded LBRY but I fear that content is shared using a protocol similar to bitTorrent. Which makes me liable for copyright infringement on an industrial scale if I happen to seed a video containing copyrighted material.
