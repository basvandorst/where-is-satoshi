There is, the previous comment is not entirely correct. Generally the question is not where you live but where you are tax resident. This is typically where you work, and coincides for most people where they live. 
In the simple case (living and working at same place) it's usually the bigger part of the year, that is 183 days. In case you don't work on live elsewhere, proof/decision is harder to come by.
Generally the details are regulated by bilateral tax agreements, so if you want to move from eg France to Germany, you need to look at the fra-ger agreement. You want to take a tax lawyer for that.

Thank you Meni. This post very much reflects my position.
I hate that we're only presented with two choices and forced to select one - a false dichotomy and strategically a bad choice by Mike and Gavin.
However, I find it even more troublesome that people prefer an developer oligarchy over the build-in democracy of bitcoin (however centralized this may have become). Forking must be part of bitcoin, because this is the only way stakeholders ever get a vote.

While having a "benevolent dictator" works in Linux, I am not sure whether this would work in bitcoin where the monetary interests of so many entities are directly affected.
In the end, hoping for SN resolving the issue is kind of hoping of salvation by whichever religious figure. I will never happen, and will impede you from working on making reality better.

This isn't huge, unfortunately: it's not the whole EDEKA chain that accepts bitcoin, it's a single shop in Hamburg that specializes in home delivery that decided to accept bitcoin. :(

No, it isn't if it's actually supposed to do anything. :) You get a free proxy, but for more sophisticated protection features, you need to get a paid plan. That said, the "business" option for 200$ a month is still dirt-cheap...

"Thanks donor" should be more like it, no? ;)
