The basis of society were created in order to keep one another safe. This "freedom" your talking about has more potential in doing bad than good. and FYI bitcoin is not perfect yet, it still has room for improvement 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:27:42
well one thing was learned, you have a very narrowed way of thinking 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:36:04
ok well try to unlock your phone (assuming it has face recognition) using a picture. I'm curious to see what would happen 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:55:35
lol too much to handle?
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:20:38
I understand, But you have to remember we live in a society where laws and rules are important. And in order for bitcoin to expand market, it has to comply with society rules
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:42:24
ok so why not adopt it with bitcoin also. And btw thanks for this info, i really didn't know about this
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:16:21
Well, i would suggest switching to monero cryptocurrency, if it's anonymity you are looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:30:25
ok, but you have to understand this concept: Government and Anonymity don't mix
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:06:02
if theft is one of the risk of bitcoins, I don't see a future for bitcoin. Look I'm predicting the next crash for bitcoins, there is going to be a group of hackers that is going to exploit bitcoins and people wallets (go listen to 
The only way to prevent this problem and keeping bitcoin alive, is to find a solution before the problem happens 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:08:58
it doesn't! the MAIN purpose of bitcoin is to remove the power from the bank's hand and give it to the people. As far as I'm concerned, that hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is that bitcoins wallet are identifiable 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:59:50
I understand the concept of Bitcoins. But in all great things, there needs to be a compromise. In this case, it's the anonimity that needs to be compromised. The goal of bitcoin, is to give power to the people in 3rd world countries. Yes, i agree the goverment or bad people will know they have money. BUT they can't take it away from them. And i think this is the most important concept of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:29:13
to some extent i agree with you
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:13:04
Only difference
Fiat: bank's are in control
Bitcoin: People are in control
