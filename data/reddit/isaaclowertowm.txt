MSM debates will always be shit. You can't have a debate in 4 minutes. And them likening it to a Lincoln Douglas type of debate is laughable. 
Real policy or LD debates should take place in academic settings or in environments that hold the same standards.
Given at least 40 minutes, both people would have great points to bring up. That being said, Goldmoney.com shouldnt be compared to bitcoin. This is coming from someone that has gold stored with them, has redeemed physical gold from them, and wears their shirts at least two times per week. 
I own both. I'm accumulating both. I'm more bullish on BTC.

Right. I get the conflict of interest, but he has accepted BTC through his own physical redemption company over a year before he owned part of Goldmoney.com. 
He's no fool. I mean, who wouldn't accept BTC if you can just have a payment processor instantly convert it to USD?  That's like turning down easy, no bullshit sales. Many of you that buy bullion have probably noticed gold seller's affinity to low risk transactions and aversion to credit cards via high fees, long wait times, or phone interrogations. 
Peter is just hoping that this "digital gold" via Goldmoney.com can offer the same thing as a decentralized, no permission digital currency. WRONG. I got slapped with KYC/AML procedures with Goldmoney.com much sooner than I thought I would. I knew it would come at some point, and I guess i was fine to acquiesce, but this just makes me feel as if the gold I store online with them is only available to me if I ask and say please.

Thanks for the heads up. Consider using Overstock.com instead. Pay direct with BTC. You might pay a bit more and the selection may be smaller, but CEO  Patrick Byrne has proven to be such an outstanding guy even before he entered the crypto arena.
