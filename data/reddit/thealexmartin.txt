How long does it typically take? Milliseconds or minutes?

I'll take a look. I certainly understand some points of it and I've only skimmed it at the moment (working on some other things right now) but I'll read through all of it later. The way I see it Bitcoin will not be the best currency, sure it has first mover advantage but I do not think it is the "best" coin. 
The crytpocurrency or new gold rush the way I see it is only just beginning and I'm excited but still speculative to see what comes out on top.
Something to keep in mind -

Thank you. It's funny you mention Enron, as my family and others, were bumped by that shady company. Anyways the crypto currencies I'm looking at have real value. One for instance is Peercoin. It has great attributes that would be valued in a "crypto market". This has been trading at 1.3-1.6 for the past few weeks and has hit a low at the moment of 1.10. This is soley because of the price bump on Bitcoin.

I've seen many people go down that road and its definitely a slippery slope when you carry payments over. 21% will really kill you. I actually have a credit card for just that and it happens to build my credit. Anything wants/not necessities I put on my debit card, though.

Oh, goodness. You are annoying.
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:15:28
Yeah, you've gotta go *all in* on it.

I use MasterCard and have a Visa debit card which they do not accept. Thank you though, I hope others use this feature now!

Well that's just great. I'm not really into credit, not that mines bad, I just don't believe in the whole borrow money that isn't mine mentality. It can get you into some trouble so I'll just leave that alone until I need a house/etc. Too bad though, that's a great option for Coinbase.

It depends on your financial situation, definitely. There are certain things that you should try to buy with BTC just so its value rises, along with your investment. Don't spend all your Bitcoin on a Dell, thats not what I'm saying. If you go to the movies though, ask them if they accept Bitcoin. That is all.

You're forgetting this is a capital market. I'm here to make money. Thats why I'm buying Peercoin. At a 25 Million USD market cap it is a buy. 
When a big problem occurs its not going to be as simple as "switching the code". Have you heard of a 51% attack? What do you think happens when that occurs... 
What you're saying is like telling everyone to switch to English even though speaking Japanese (etc.) has its perks at home.
Lastly, how is this painful for the average joe?
and... are you telling me I'm not allowed to make any money? ;)

Not available in my area yet, unfortunately.

I would love to get in, but at the moment I think it is a bit pricey. Think it will come down any time soon?
Advice when investing in BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:03:20
Missing this boat, but still not entirely, is only something to learn from. Knowing I had the opportunity to get on this around $10.00 really hurts, but that only makes me remember this opportunity cost when investing in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:08:32
Yeah, shit.. send that on over here!

What is the problem getting cash out of Mt. Gox?
*Sorry... newb here*
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:08:14
Is there going to be any potential for LTC? It just seems like everyone could abandon BTC and move to Litecoins for multiple reasons.

A little late to this party but I just got into blockchain.info yesterday actually! Here's my address if you're still feeling generous - 1PHuNMEjBycfAgc7wyQLmAjDDnF1m2A3pv - Thanks very much for doing this.
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:37:44
I just got started with Blockchain.info and I really like it, there is a way to make your Bitcoins into a paper wallet so it is even more secure (other places can do this too, surely, but this one is easy). Also the price of BTC is generally lower than MT. Gox and right around the median.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:16:26
It doesn't state how you get these bitcoins to BitAddress.org - Unless the obvious answer of you get it on blockchain. Is this correct?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:05:21
I waited on blockchain.info for the whole day. Missed out on the $250 per coin I was attempting and instead recieved $300 per coin transaction. So.. that sucked.

I understand why there is a difference between prices like Blockchain and Mt. Gox, but is there a way to profit from that difference?
1 - Buy BTC on Blockchain
2 - Transfer to Mt. Gox
3 - Sell on Mt. Gox
4 - ???????
5 - Profit!
