You dont sell bitcoin. Its like gold you buy and keep it. If you want to buy some shoes, use fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:33
If you think so... I just keep earning my money. You can keep working for your money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:37
The secret is work hard first. Then let the money work for you! :)

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:54

Tell him to claim all his pension money and put it into bitcoin.
Problem solved 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:20:35
There will be a correction q1 2018 probably. From 18000 to 13000.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:13
Wow there are actually still people waiting for the 5k dip. This is getting hilarious xD At 8k they waited for 5k at 10k, 12k now its 15k and you still waiting for 5k xD you better buy now or never. Because when you wake up tomorrow, it sure will be at 18k.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:08:05
Good question indeed.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:57:24
Yes osama. My english isnt so good.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:53:11
Interesting. Much better than all those naive "its over 9000" or "to the moon" posts.
I still think, that bitcoin is a part of controllng the population. You know cashless society. People will get chipped. The ones who dont accept the chip, cant buy, cant travel, cant do anything. Since everything will be on that chip (your passport, bankaccount, medical record and so on). 
You know they sell it for freedom and decentralized. They always did. But when looking deeper, everyone can see where you paid and what you received on blockchain. 
Also bitcoin was/is the first step to a cashless society. Now ask the question is this good or bad? I think its bad. Because the second step would be to chip the population. 
And with the AI coming man this is not good at all...
After AI and robots the fourth step would be Gene Manipulation. Then we would have robots and mutants running around. No humans anymore. Maybe all those scifi movies were true. But thats another topic...

I am worried aswell of a bitcoin crash
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:16:13
Just hodl m8.
Thats it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:20:48
Yes brother. You understood me. I mean people would just go around and wreck havoc, because they have suddenly no money. Then the us goverment comes up with chips where all your information is in and we will have to work like slaves to pay back our debts. Anarchy could be around the corner.

1. People get their monthy income and have the opportunity to buy bitcoins
2. Bitcoin has been hyped for the last 2 weeks
3. Big Bang Theory episode is aired tonight.
4. Bitcoin dipped from 11k to 9k
Buy as long as you can. I see bullish to 13k. Dont miss this train. Sell at 13k.

@_date: 2017-11-26 23:00:37
Exactly. Suddenly bitcoin rose to the moon just like that. I know there are very powerful people in the background. They are planning to control us. What if bitcoin is their weapon?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:23:37
They tell me i am dumb and a troll. They are naive i think. I dont think getting "rich" is that easy. The people in the higher position dont want us to get rich. They can stop this bitcoin thing if they want, but they dont. So i am asking why? Do they want more people in this, so they can make bitcoin worth 0 and have more people wreck havoc and kill each other?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:53:00
Exactly xD
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:56:25
Dude lets discuss if you want.
What i am saying is: The usa pulls this strategy to fool the population. They invent characters like osama or satoshi, to implement their evil plans.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:16:10
Why? Please explain
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:10:48
But i dont want to mine myself. I want to rent some antminers from mining companies.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:53:57

Roger ver has a small dick and is obviously mad about it.
