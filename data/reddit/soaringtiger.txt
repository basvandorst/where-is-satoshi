Why do you say that?

The one not in the Lamborghini is real holder. He did not sell and therefore unable to buy a Lamborghini.
Or you could say they all spent btc direct for Lamborghini. Who knows.

If you are buying. I would say local bitcoins would be faster. That requires you to go in with cash and deposit into someone else's account and they would then release the bitcoins to you.

Theres a comment in the article that says it is applying to business vpns, not personal ones. Let's hope that's true.

Just a heads up, I had the same issue with bank of America. No warning, immediate termination of account. Be careful on how much you sell in a short period of time.

I took me a while to get an answer. They tell you to call a number. Then after they realize why the account is terminated, they transfer you to that specific department. This department just repeats the same thing over and over again stating that the terms and agreement signed between you and the bank allows for either party to terminate the account at any time for any reason and that the reason need not be given. They took about a week to process everything after which I called back and only then they told me to go to any branch office where they would cashier check the remaining balance on my account.
I felt like a criminal in the entire time. The crime probably money laundering. Only till I went to the branch office did a real person help me. I explained the situation and they were shocked. They never heard of that department that was dealing to account security and terminations. And they tried their best to help me what they good.
I can understand the logic behind it, as I am now blacklisted from bank of America for the rest of my life, why treat me with any diginity. So just a warning for those selling bitcoins.

DO NOT USE PAYPAL OR ANY OTHER MIDDLEMAN.
The reason why the risk is set to hgoh is because you do not control the way the money is processed. Paypal can reverse or freeze activity at their discretion. That defeats the function of digital cash.
Always use cash for cash, whether it is cash in person or cash wire. No checks, no digital intermediaries, no gift cards.
If you want to be extra safe deal with people with minimum 50 references and at least 20 btc volume.
You should read their guide on the matter. The most important thing from that guide is scammers are always in a rush. Real dealers are in no rush. So if someone is telling you to hurry or the just need small amount now but right now, it's always a scam.
Stay alert and happy trading.
