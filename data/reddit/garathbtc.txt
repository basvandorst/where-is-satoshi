Today, if a really big institutional wanted to take a share of the cake, at a significant proportion for himself or its customers, he would need to put maybe $100 millions.
Given the fact that it is 200% of the average daily transaction volume on the whole blockchain, they would never enter in such an illiquid and tiny market. The price shift would be tremendous if they had to get out.

this is not legal tender
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:52:22
So that's artificial volume.

No you are not going to have my precious

This is called market making.

That time, I also tried the US version of Expedia, Bitcoin was not an option either. I don't know why.
Maybe the site recognized my location.
But I will try again next time.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:22:39
Haven't found bitcoin payment option on my local (european) version of Expedia.
So I used CheapAir : I confirm very quick and efficient service. Just what I needed.

I don't care.
Whatever the symbol, it's a means not a goal.
Make bitcoin widespread, and the actual symbol will come into Unicode.
Use the new proposition if it can speed things up.

Damned this is a pretty in-depth report (143 pages) !
It might be worthy, and I sure have some reading.

To be started, the ETF does not need to buy bitcoins on the market.
It buys the Winklewii's bitcoins, and in exchange the brothers receive shares (that they will be free to sell on the market).
It is a good way for the brothers to sell their bitcoins without disrupting the market price.
We hear a lot of riff-raff about the price going up because of this ETF, but the only good thing is that bitcoins access will be much more integrated into the present financial system.

This news (from newpaper Le Monde) is 18 days old.
Nothing new under the sun.

Tourists would have a nice way to grab a stash of VEF for their short-trip vacations, while helping the bitcoin economy, wouldn't they ?
@_date: 2014-05-28 07:51:45
There are so few restaurants in Paris accepting bitcoin, that this indeed deserves to be mentioned.
Thanks !

Zero risk and fabulous returns ? Certainly a scam.
Beautifully presented, but a scam.

The 5 first questions are usual.
But the 6th question, which seems to be new, could be particularly tedious to justify.
I hope this won't be the start of Bitstamp's demise.

12 victims, among them 4 historical drawers.
This is not going to help for fundraising, but one could embed in the blockchain some emblematic drawings of the victims.
Remember, remember ..

I like this video, and as a simple user, I made my part.

Miners power is overestimated. They only serve users (against a fee).
Wallets, exchanges, and even devs also serve users.
Ultimately, users do not always make bitcoin, but they rule over it.
@_date: 2016-01-21 10:22:56
Both coins ? Congratulations, this is surely the best proposal.

It seems that this fund manager is even not in the top 10 in Germany.

Thank you for expressing my thoughts.

BCI does not know your private keys.
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:16:16
Even Localbitcoins is doomed : in February they started requiring ID just for posting an ad. So at least one participant of the deal is not anonymous.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:16:21
Are there some usable desktop and Android wallets ?

Another proof that Bitpay is exactly what bitcoin stands against.
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:20:59
This is great.
I wonder how they are going to manage the withdrawals after the split. How will they avoid the transaction to be replayed on the other chains ?

No, it changed this year for crypto to fiat. 30% flat tax on gains.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:48:39
No you **cannot** opt for the "flat tax", as bitcoin is not a "valeur mobilière". Or prove it by giving me your source ! Maybe in the future (I hope so)  
There is a deduction for detention time for the new regime, and here are the sources :
[Capital gains on "biens meubles"]( refer to article 150 UA of the CGI  
[Article 150 UA detailed in the BOFIP]( : see (110)
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:21:37
It would be 19%+17.2%=36.2% instead of [0%;45%]+17.2%=[17.2%;62.2%], depending on the marginal tax bracket.  
So the new method could actually be worse, also considering that the previous regime could allow some substantial deductions ("regime micro").   
aaaand a rebate for hodlers : 5% for every year after the 2nd year of hodling ! ಠ‿↼

Non, attention ce n'est pas 5k de bénéfice, c'est 5k sur le prix de vente ! C'est moins avantageux.

It is not necessary to be a french citizen to be french fiscal resident. It is sufficient to live here &gt; 6mo, or to have the center of your economic of familial life in France.  
But depending on your nationality and the tax convention with your country, it might not be enough to drop your tax rate.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:56:29
It is not clearly stated, but following the logic of the tax system, each crypto to crypto selling would be a taxable event.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:17:49
See [form n°2048-M](  
As the change comes late for 2017, you can choose any method.  
Depending on your marginal tax bracket, and the previous option (BNC, micro-BNC, BIC, micro-BIC) the new method might be worse !

These numbers are overinflated for BTC-China due to their 0% commission fee.
What is the fee for the others ?

The bounty on [this thread](
There is (currently) a 0.75 BTC reward to anyone who will prove havind done a recent successful USD withdrawal.
But you initially talked about EUR withdrawal.
I am also waiting for a SEPA withdrawal, since 3 weeks.

They are now stating : "We don't accept international wire transfers from US Citizens or from US Banks. All transfers from US Citizens or US Bank will be refused by bank"
So I guess it is not an option for US citizens, thanks to FATCA.

Valve delegates the sale of games to an unnamed "Game distributor" - let's call him GD.  
GD delegates the sale of coupons to SteamLoader.  
Great.  
But the end-user only knows Steam/Valve. He would have much more confidence if :  
1. SteamLoader was somehow mentioned in an official statement on Valve's website  
or at least  
2. The chain of delegation could easily reconstructed by the end-user (name of the distributor mentioned by Valve, Steamloader mentioned on the distributor's website as a way to buy cards with bitcoins)
Yeah delegation comes with responsibility, and that's something companies might be afraid of.  
I'm **not** saying Steamloader is a scam, I'm just saying it has no known ex-ante endorsement.  
Anyways you website looks neat, and the service is really needed !
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:22:27
How do I know you are an "authorized distributor" ?

If all the energy of the universe was used to point guns at all miners to change the protocol, billions of new BTCs could be created.
