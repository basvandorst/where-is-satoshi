This is the most important topic / problem bitcoin has. It *should* be a daily conversation.

Looking at your post history though, you are nowhere near elite. Reminds me of the quote that says Americans are temporarily broke millionaires.
Sad man.

This doesn't sound like a big deal. In fact, I'd interpret this as a good thing: the Chinese government is seriously looking into Chinese exchanges and agreeing on most things.

If I mine my RoI comes after 2 or 3 years (if at all) with tons of risks.
If a person in China mines his RoI comes after 8 to 10 months with much lower risks.
Still too complicated for you?

Just looked through his post history, the guy lives in a closet.

India's system has nothing to do with blockchain and the benefits it brings. You have to trust the Indian government not to inflate your monetary supply, confiscate your funds, or control what you can or cannot use your money on.
India's tech is what, a database?

Let's see how you react to on-your-face evidence.
"Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. **At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a [single stage.]( The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow."
-Mike Hearn, **ex bitcoin core developer.**
Any PoW coin will end up centralized wherever the costs are cheaper. You can't compete if your energy costs are three or four times more expensive.
Edit: to save anyone from this moron's ramblings here's a small example of what competitive advantage does to RoI:
.05 USD /KW you get 2.77 USD / day profit
but if you increase the electricity cost
.15 USD / KW you get 3.47 USD / day **loss**

You live in a place smaller than my closet.
But then again maybe you hang with losers? A closet might be elite in your circles.

You should ask for a loan and invest more.

Satoshi made the (understandable) mistake of not realizing that mining would end up centralized in China.
Are we supposed to not talk about that because "that is the way the protocol is designed"?

Are you slow?

I thought it was more like 2 or 3?

"But Bitcoin was never supposed to be cash!!"
*reads whitepaper title* 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:52:44
That has nothing to do with BTC; they just want to be able to track and block transactions on a centralized, government owned system.
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:31:52
Is it opinion or a fact that bitcoin is not decentralized? 90% of bitcoin mining is practically owned by 10~ people.
@_date: 2017-04-28 00:46:01
But enough to attract the interest of 300+ of the biggest corporations in the world. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:38:32
Decentralized = as close to 1 cpu = 1 vote, as originally envisioned by satoshi
Practically owned = controlled
10 people~ = handful
It's a fact, not an opinion. Read up:
Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.
Why are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the “Bitcoin Core” software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as “disloyalty” —and they’re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a “split” and cause investor panic. They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.
And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government’s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide. Imagine an entire country connected to the rest of the world by cheap hotel wifi, and you’ve got the picture. Right now, the Chinese miners are able to — just about — maintain their connection to the global internet and claim the 25 BTC reward ($11,000) that each block they create gives them. But if the Bitcoin network got more popular, they fear taking part would get too difficult and they’d lose their income stream. This gives them a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular.
Many Bitcoin users and observers have been assuming up until very recently that somehow these problems would all sort themselves out, and of course the block chain size limit would be raised. After all, why would the Bitcoin community … the community that has championed the block chain as the future of finance … deliberately kill itself by strangling the chain in its crib? But that’s exactly what is happening.
The resulting civil war has seen Coinbase — the largest and best known Bitcoin startup in the USA — be erased from the official Bitcoin website for picking the “wrong” side and banned from the community forums. When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy.

How dare you be neutral and let the users choose how to scale?
This is blasphemy!

True, eth is still young (they were talking about trillion dollar eth marketcap at consensys). 
But at least eth floats. Btc sank 10 meters out.

He's not talking about any of that, he means Luke trying to take over the name Bitcoin.
