I was always taught to spread my seed not memorize it. :/

I like the concept of buying Btc with old cars

100k or bust...

Congrats...you may now assume the time honored identity of satoshi nakamoto like the rest of us
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:40:24
Now I'm wondering why we didn't just have an orgy
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:19:15
Screw that...my millions of Dev coins are the future
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:21:27
I can confirm that I am in no relation to any bankers that I am aware of. Regardless they will only serve to make us richer.

A someone that bought in the last time Btc jumped in price...I would wait for the market to stabilize again before buying...just my 2 cents
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:16:20
That is untrue...at least 2 of us know. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:15:17
100k or bust :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:12:09
I will confess...She was texting me...
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:34:13
I can confirm this as I am satoshi nakamoto. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:41:43
These were not my coins. 100k or bust. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:54:30
I am satoshi nakamoto
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:17:36
This was my reaction to you walking in on us
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:21:56
They are just lowering the price so many of us can buy back in :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:10:25
That is the Btc lottery that I want to win
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:28:57
And them softly cries while wishing he had invested at 10$. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:12:36
As someone who has been eating bitcoin for over a year...this is the future of food

Good guy google
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:27:11
Not even once
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:16:42
Oh god no...shitty homemade websites are very vulnerable. People get lazy and only apply the required security protocols. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:55:59
I'm not
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:56:41
This is also my reaction as someone who could have invested when they were 10 cents :: and again as someone who did not invest enough
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:14:12
Bitstamp was 20 over gox earlier
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:01:52

@_date: 2013-12-04 12:11:45

@_date: 2013-12-19 12:58:12
100k or bust
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:58:28
And when the price jumped from 80 - 270...
