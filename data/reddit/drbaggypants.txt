The raw blockchain is stored in blk***.dat files. 
Transactions and key relevant to an individual wallet are stored in a Berkeley DB. The UTXO list (all unspent transactions) are kept in a constantly updated leveldb instance for fast access when validating incoming transactions.

berkeley and leveldb are used within the core client to store transaction data so that it is quickly accessible, but they are separate conceptually to the 'blockchain'.

Does it require downloading the full Liquid blockchain?

Craig said he is not interested and would turn it down anyway.

The real number is &lt;&lt; 700. 
And they are pretty much all un-patentable and/or covered by prior art.

Maybe the patent won't be granted, or is unenforceable. But it does show nChain invented the stable-chain concept over two years ago.

Err - where did I say it was a patent - or are you yet another dumbfuck who can't read?
It is not granted - but it is a patent filing - with a priority date of 15 May 2017.

Great, but was invented by nChain over 2 years ago: [

Bitcoin doesn't require adherence to an 'ethos' to operate.

It's not just the 'creation' that requires the fee, but all transactions.

Looking like quite a bit more than 5 cents at the moment: [
But, that fee is not just for the initial issuance of the token, it applies to *every* subsequent transaction of that token.
