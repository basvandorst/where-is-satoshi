So it is a multisig wallet. Could you show me where I can find this information on Coinbase website ? I have read that it is apply for vault but not for simple account. 
Also I believe that you don't have full access to your bitcoins with Coinbase so it is kind of a bitcoin bank account ? Does it really add ease of use ? 
I mean you could multisig walllet without the need to rely on a company to do it for you.

No one, it is common sense. Good if you find it easier, I actually find it quite difficult for online purchase... Not every store accept it, you need an escrow to avoid scam and there is price volatility. 
I also have this weird believe that Bitcoin is a p2p currency that has been designed to be used without third party involved and without the need of an insecure complicated structure when the system on its own does work smoothly. Why adding cost and useless complexity ?

Are you still developing it ? The reddit thread look dead.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:33:10
Start here ---&gt; 
And remember private key should stay private. This is the proof of ownership (too much new user don't know that).
Trust the crypto, not the third-party.
Peace and avocados.

I want to avoid the word "wallet" to make the difference more clear. I also think that "wallet" does not give a good description of the concept because it hold private key and not "money"...

Why do you use Bitcoin if you don't care about those things ? Use USD it is more simple and largely adopted.
Adopt Bitcoin properly or don't, being inbetween is a waste of time.

This is brillant.
This, my friend, marks the end of The Age of Bullshit !

Is it what the Bitcoin community want ? Because I don't.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:14:52
If I am not mistaken it doesn't use bitcoin really but the same crypto as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:03:36
Yep.

This is not only in the American culture. I live in an European country where people are scared and are ready to give more and more power to their government and sacrifice their liberty. Which had lead so far to unjustify violence. So that's why I am comfortable with Bitcoin. Anonymity is the only way to escape this and gain a little of liberty back.

How the rating works ? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:59:59
Nvm. I found the article (
Could you give more detail on how it will "... help prevent fraud, abuse, and exploitation of the system." This not clear in the article how it will works.

OneCoin is a scam.

"Blockchain" or what I prefer to call the proof-of-work chain. Is an answer to the Byzantine general's problem (
It allows to be sure that everyone in the network has the same information.
Here an email in which Satoshi explain the problem : 
There is actually others solutions that has been used for years like Paxos. Not sure what are the pros or cons of using one or the other.
I hope it answers your question. I have been through the same experience as you and I tried to work on what is possible to do or not to do for a couple of months now. I would be glad to discuss about it with you.

Sorry the example might be misleading. It suppose to be a template/theme that can be change. You don't have to put your name (obviously I am not a goat and Sacha Evans is not my name) or any information really.
The only thing that is really linked to the addresses is the domain name.

I also added the SSL certificate using let's encrypt.

 ou  ?
The second link (test and copy/paste it) is mine it was a phishing website that I made using homoglyph attack. But don't worry it was just redirecting to a gif with a message saying "Comment est votre blanquette ? ".
This comment is actually useless. I just wanted to brag a little because I thought it was cool (like script kiddie level cool). Also never trust link !

 It is not an exchange but a broker. You can buy your first bitcoins and ethers without ID until 250 euros. Good support. Swiss company. They directly send it to my wallet. Yep.

Yes, Bity has been launch last October or November.

Buy some bitcoins, invest in water, telecommunication and transport companies.
You can also try to invest in some local business or organization in your area that you think will improve the quality of life of your community. For me that would be buying a building to start a hackerspace in my hometown in France and a small business of freelancer that would hire members of the hackerspace or stuff like that. Where I come from kids are smart but there is nothing to do and it is no Silicon Valley and factories are closing since 2008.
Then invest in your education. Knowledge is what matters. Read, talk to people, learn about philosophy, math, history, others cultures...

Where I live there is some demonstrations for different reasons against the governement or politician. People have their flags to show their appartenance to a group. I wish I had a Bitcoin one when walking with them.

This is a really cool project. Congrats. 
So I can buy something and I will see it on the stream ? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:22:05
Yes, it is using cyrillic letters.
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:08:47
I had the same error. It was because I need to be verified. You can only use 2 500€ before reaching the limit where you need to send documents to be verfied.

Would you be available for a drink next week ?

I will. Thanks for your interest.
