Hope you have an iron arrow ready to get your wallet back. (reference to Smaug from The Hobbit)

Not true, Clinton was the last of the good modern day Presidents. He’s the only one who had a surplus during his administration and didn’t have unending government expansion.

His watch says even less, no hands!

You mean Uncle Sam? Because I've never heard of our government referred to as "Uncle Sugar".

I don't even understand why the hoody bothered with a cryptocurrency to begin with. How much shit do ppl buy on Facebook? If Amazon came up with a cryptocurrency and you got free overnight shipping everytime you paid with it I guarantee you, that shit would take off.

The only rationale I can come up with for the hoody to make his own crypto is that he looked over at the twins and said, yea that's what I should have done, and did it.

Did you even bother to read the article? That article is a complete joke. There are exactly zero details on how the hacker got hold of his cell phone account.

That's a thing now. Do you know how many Google software engineers sleep in their cars? Do a search on Youtube. The first one I knew of purchased a trailer and lived in it for months (he was living in the employee parking lot) before security looked at it. 
Google makes it easy because they have showers and feed their employees free gourmet meals and unlimited snacks. 
There's another story of a Google engineer who lived on the street for about 5 years, saved his money and bought a home.

So should I buy a few bitcoins to get a history? Then after I get a history I will be eligible to buy lots of BTC later on yes?

100% bullshit. I called my cell phone provider here in the US recently because people have been mocking me, saying 2FA using smart phone is ineffective. My cell phone provider has a 6 digit security code that you need to know if you want a SIM transfer. 
Also, I read the linked article above thoroughly, looking specifically for how this hacker got hold of his cell phone account and there's zero details. All he says is that he was careless and lackadaisical in his approach meaning he probably fell for the oldest trick in the book, a phishing email or similar and gave his passwords out.

Your credit card info was likely stolen without your knowledge. 148 million people had all of their info hacked in 2018 with the Equifax hack: 
Don't forget, other retailers like Target and many others have been hacked as well.

Please help me understand Coinbase daily limits! Just opened an account. I'm looking at the limits screen and this is what I see: 
It says my bank purchases is $1000/day but $25000 for Paypal withdrawal. I want to purchase $25000 of BTC in one day. Can I do it? If I wire the money does the bank need to be open?

For every transaction on Coinbsse a verification gets sent to my phone. I'm not worried about a hack. You may have my password but you're not getting my phone.
