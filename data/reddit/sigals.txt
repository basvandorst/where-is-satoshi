Encryption works but at the end of the day the instructions have to be executed on the CPU at some point and by that time they are decrypted.
Similarly encryption is useless if you can intercept the data before/after decryption.

If Alice and Bob can only afford to lock up enough money to facilitate their channel, and Charlie and Dave can only lock up enough money to facilitate their channel, then Alice and Bob cannot find routes to either Charlie or Dave.
If Eric is also a participant, and Eric is a Bitcoin mega-whale, and he's already made channels with Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave. Eric is a central hub.
If LN is to be permissionless, there's no way to prevent a megawhale from establishing himself as the "center" of such a network, and becoming a de facto central hub.

I was speaking to some devs on IRC a while ago about this who have in-depth knowledge and they said that shnorr signitures would not be compatible with legacy addresses.

Correct however this probably wont be possible from legacy addresses.

It's quite unlikely that a transaction with 0 fee would be included into a block. The fee goes to the miner who includes your transaction in a block. It's not essential to pay a fee but it improves your chances of getting a transaction confirmed in a timely manner because the miner has more incentive.
If everyone is increasing their fee then this can escalate quickly and transactions with lower fees won't be prioritised.

Forward secrecy: Messages are only encrypted with temporary per-message AES keys, negotiated using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. The compromise of any long-lived cryptographic keys does not compromise any previous conversations, even if an attacker is in possession of ciphertexts.
Deniable authentication: Messages in a conversation do not have digital signatures, and after a conversation is complete, anyone is able to forge a message to appear to have come from one of the participants in the conversation, assuring that it is impossible to prove that a specific message came from a specific person. Within the conversation the recipient can be sure that a message is coming from the person they have identified.

The original claim you made was that blocks being broadcast over TOR were predictable in the sense that you could distinguish them over other forms of encrypted traffic traversing the network, that is not true.
When a user controls a certain amount of exit nodes they can attempt to de-anonymise users... but if you control an exit node traffic leaving it is unencrypted anyway.
