I'm sorry but this is so ridiculously dumb that I'm going to assume you are trying some kind of scam here.
Anyone who is into 3D printing is into bitcoin and vice versa.
You know this. Your imaginary business partner knows this. Everyone knows this.
Stop begging for donations asshole.
If your imaginary business partner *really is* as insane as you are trying to portray him you should just leave him before worse things happen.

that is the dumbest post i read today.
OP is a known troll alt account.
who the fuck upvoted this shit? it makes so little sense it doesn't even deserve an answer.
if you believe one word of what OP said you don't understand bitcoin and shouldn't be on this board.
go to to the wiki, to the FAQ, to your irl nerd friends, but whatever you do, don't invest anything at all in bitcoin.
you will lose it due to your own ignorance.

1. learn to secure your computer (install linux (but not Ubuntu, use kubuntu, lubuntu,.. instead))
2. buy and hold as much as you can afford to lose, never panic sell
3. buy some more just to spend on [shops that accept bitcoin]( ([more](
don't fall for scammers, don't talk to anyone about how much btc you have.
never panic sell or you will sooner or later mispredict the market and suffer the same fate as the idiots who sold after silk road got busted - the price never went as low as it was before the SR bust ever again and they lost bigtime.

LOL, no i don't remember that.
China banned all past, present and future ecurrencies? Now you're just being funny :)
Are you mocking the idiots who said in december that in february nobody will be able to trade bitcoin in china anymore? :D
Wish those guys had been right -.-
No, actually i wish that the rest of would have learned anything from their epic failure.

downvote and report the thread, don't give them any pageviews, even with NoScript activated.
OP you're a fucking asshole for sharing such bullshit.
at least copypaste the text so we can tell you why it is bullshit without visiting their bullshit site.

you're a fucking moron if you think daytrader exchanges in china will die anytime soon. 
there are just too many legal ways to work around everything.
a random example: exchanges could just move their headquarters offshore and sell ecurrencies where 1 unit = 1 bitcoin in china. when such a currency gets outlawed they can just create a new one and trade that.
though i wish they would just shut down all daytrader exchanges worldwide so everyone would have to get his coins on p2p exchanges.
no daytraders = natural adoption only = stable price and constant growth like it used to be.

if you censor arguments by downvoting them because of the way they are said you are a fucking piece of shit and partially responsible for the bad things that are happening in the world.
heck, you don't even dare to say the word 'asshole' out of fear that you might [offend]( someone.
i sure as hell won't let reddit censor my words just so i can become another cell in the tumor that is US keep-people-quiet propaganda.
i create new nicks all the time to avoid this kind of pathetic self-censorship. you aren't free if you care about your image more than about truth.
