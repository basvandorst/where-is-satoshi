No, too logical, not greedy enough and fuck bitcoin obviously

Thanks

Seriously? Its an analogy to the price swings of bitcoin. Unlike his counter parts he is not phased by the exciting highs and lows of the roller coaster because he has been here before.

While that's logical I seriously doubt it.

You could just shadow a public trading figure like I don't know if its frowned upon but ehh could work.

~1 million dollars in 6 months. What kind of return is that? 
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:36:58
The way you are talking about bitcoin you are referring to all cryptocurrencies and the idea of digital scarcity and predictable inflation/deflation achieved by a distributed p2p blockchain with incentives for maintaining it. The US government in no way can easily "shut down" that idea. What if the reason they haven't done what you describe is because it would ignite more widespread knowledge and innovation? Maybe they can shut down bitcoin, but they can't shut down the idea. Its out there and I seriously doubt its going anywhere.

I dont remember how I stumbled across it, but one way or another I found the buttcoiners. Eventually learned enough, felt comfortable, and bought 30 bitcoin for 900 bucks. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:40:26
Haha I also learned of bitcoin from buttcoiners.

It wouldn't even be that small, I dont know the exact number of productive nodes, but i think its &lt;10k. Are all nodes equally beneficial to the network? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:08:42
Ehhh skewer them? That seems dramatic. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:17:54
They will publicly destroy the coins.

Yeah once they pull giftcards from Wal-Marts and Walgreens and every grocery store/retail location in the United States. Any day now every gift card will be spent.

You're looking at it wrong. Alt-coins don't *have* to exist yet their existence is inevitable.
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:16:45
Lol since you walk out of the bubble man. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 03:34:06
Oh no! What ever did she do?? 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:17:05
Contribution! 
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:30:49
Right. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:19:04
Don't think that was the goal. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:36:56
Okay, that will be 3.7 bitcoins.
