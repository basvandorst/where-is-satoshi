Soz for ur loss.

John, we both know that you're currently down $3.5k or so because you stupidly bet a second time on shitcoins
That's the problem with gamblers, they don't know when to quit.

Here's what I find curious about you: You're a grown man in your 50s, yet you act like an immature teenager. You don't seem to have any prior experience investing. You churn through flashy sports cars and post images of them on Reddit in a vain attempt to impress people. You curse like an angsty teenager. You seem to be oblivious of how putting all your identifiable information online could come back to haunt you.
I wonder if you've always gone through life like this, or are attempting to relive your days of youthfulness.

No, I am the real Charlie Shrem, and I have the proceeds of crime to prove it!

You've only got a bunch of shitcoins. You don't have any money until you sell.
In reality you had a winning position, but you squandered it by buying in again at $1000+/BTC, and then continuing to buy in a desperate bid to make up for your losses. But of course all that 'cost averaging' did was to dig a deeper hole for you - and you're quite heavily invested in a losing position.
It seems like you bet a second time because you regretted selling out early and only ended up with a fraction of the fortune you could have had. And now that you've done it, youve made the same mistake again - but in the opposite way. Now you have two major regrets.
Thank god I don't have to live with those regrets. I was considering buying 60 BTC for $30 back in late 2010, but I know I would have lost it in the subsequent 2011 Mtgox hack, or otherwise would have sold at $30/BTC last year. At worse, that means I have forgone $1800, which is peanuts to me. And anyway, Ive had plenty of fun gloating over foolish Bitcoiners getting crushed in the aftermath of the recent bubble, and shorting Bitcoin on the way down, mining altcoins for profit on my gaming GPU for practically nothing, etc.
I share this to contrast that you on the other hand have to live with two major regrets, and have nothing much to show for all your attention and concentration. Youll be lucky to get your money back, especially seeing as youre not going to bite the pillow and sell. No, you're not going to face the shame head on, and are instead going to wait for the inevitable forceful decimation.
I wonder if you feel the shame and anger in the pit of your stomach when you look at your car now, thinking 'If only I had..'

tl;dr 'I cashed out $16.5k to buy an 18 year old sports car like a teenager, and have since invested a net $20k - leaving me $3.5k down overall'

You currently have invested in shitcoins about $20k
You've only ever withdrawn $16.5k, and that was for a downpayment on a depreciating asset (an 18 year old car lel)

It got quickly downvoted, so people didn't get much of a chance to see it
I enjoyed it, so I thought I'd repost it again
