We're still in a stage of price discovery. Any price this year will be a steal so make sure to have time in the market rather than timing the market.

The problem here is why she owns Litecoin rather than Bitcoin. Unless she does own both, then kudos to her.

Thanks so much for the tip! I’ll pay this one forward too :D

Wow that was incredibly fast, thanks so much! I'm going to pay that forward to one of my friends who was always on the fence with bitcoin because of transaction speed. Hopefully this will convince him :D

I’ve always wanted to give lightning a go so here goes nothing :)

I think it's fair to say unreliable for transactions to not take place on the spot when you want them to.

Let’s test this out:

TIFU when I forgot how unreliable the current banking system is. I entered a transaction from one bank account to another account of a different bank. Well I was too spoiled with bitcoin being able to be transferred on any day of the week. I now have to wait 2 days for the next business day for my funds to be processed to the other account &gt;\_&gt;

You raise a good point there, thank you for the insight. I guess if more people think like this then the transition will be natural.

The amount of bitcoin these days one can buy with fiat is dwindling so much compared to a few years ago. If you are investing at the current bitcoin price one bitcoin would take let's say $3500 USD to acquire as an example. Compared to a few years ago one could have bought one bitcoin for let's say $200 USD.
Is it time we actually start pricing in satoshi/something with a smaller denomination? Imagine telling the average Joe to buy one share of Berkshire Hathaway class A. There is no way they can do it and it sounds absurd. Companies do stock splits all the time to make shares more available to the investor. I am aware bitcoin is divisible thus people won't need to buy one whole coin at a time, but will it reach the stage where we should switch to a smaller denomination that makes it sound easier to acquire?

Physical cash exchange could be a thing.
