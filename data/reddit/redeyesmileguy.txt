I am chill dude. Don't get upset because someone engages another in conversation that requires critical thinking.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:10:03
Very well said on all parts.

Your post is incredibly misleading. I am a fan of Coinbase but a recent transaction took 8 days. Funds in your wallet are those that you already had Coinbase take and process so the delay happened.

Account age 1 day and your first comments from accounts with less than a month that only post specifics about crypto...hahaha
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:48:25
Yes, you're right. Because tipping is mandatory. It's part of every purchase everywhere and expected no matter what. Tipping isn't an additional form of gratitude for going above and beyond the expected baseline level of service. It's not as though the employee is being paid a base wage by the employer to do the work.

Thanks for contributing the the conversation. ��

Good point, better to give nothing than something. /s

Great clip (and movie), thanks for posting u/crypto_phantom. Besides a good visual and being able to hear instead of only read what I'm saying I hope anyone that watches sees the other aspect. Because Mr. Pink doesn't think the same way the others do he's put down and messed with? A couple guys make the attempt to change his mind but he doesn't want to?
So that's what we do? Someone doesn't agree with us so let's talk shit, put them down, criticise them, etc...that'll show 'em. Cheese and rice, unbelievable.

I was just thinking about the variance between the current value and the price paid being higher or price sold being lower than current value on Coinbase. Any information about that?

**Still not addressing my point** that if someone offers *anything* to another person it is still an act of giving. Complaining about what was given is rotten and childish.
The federal minimum wage is $7.25, not $7.50 and that sentence is misleading. [The $2.13 amount is what the employer is required to pay if all tips the employee receives plus the $2.13/hr equal $7.25 so at the end of the day the employee makes at a minimum the $7.25/hr.]( This requires the employee reports 100% of their tips earned which we all know doesn't happen. Even if it did, the employee at the end of the day is still at a minimum making minimum wage! That's what the job description/offer said and that's what the employee should make. Why is it the consumer's responsibility to increase the amount of money the delivery driver makes? Don't want to make minimum wage? Get a job that pays more.


If the consumer doesn't receive satisfactory service they won't make purchases from the business again. The employee may be terminated or the business may go out of business. With that belief in mind it's as though the employee is holding the customer hostage. Give me more money or I'll be a crappy person.
If that's how you honestly feel I can't and wouldn't tell you you're wrong. We're all entitled to have our own opinions but I can tell you that's not how the real world works. If I as a customer don't receive great customer service from a company/restaurant/etc I won't do business with them again. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone and if it was bad enough I might take time and publicly criticize them in my own social circles or maybe somewhere like Yelp.
Tipping is a social practice that for some is expected, in other areas insulting, and for some walks a line of bribery/illegal. So because one person thinks everyone should be tipped all others are wrong if they don't? Great way to force a belief on others and judge or put someone else down for not having the same view.

Yes! I deserve to have someone spit in my food. Another great contribution from a prepubescent Reddit user. Good job on sounding cool online.

Hey thanks for the downvote. My self worth isn't tied to what random people on Reddit think about what I say so I hope you clicking that down arrow helped you feel accomplished for the day. ��
Thank you for also falling in line with the brand of Reddit users who use awesome exaggerations to try and take away from others thoughts instead of doing some actual thinking.
u/shreveportfixit are you really equating someone tipping a CC to your lockbox example? Of course you're not, but you don't have a legitimate criticism so you fabricate some comparison you think sounds cool and (since it's Reddit) hope for upvotes. Your example doesn't fit with a CC tip because the 12/13 dollars doesn't have the potential to increase in value over time the same way. If there was something in your made up security box that had the potential to increase in value exponentially then it would at least be apples to apples. What if it was a cold wallet and in 12 or 24 months the item doubled or tripled in value? What if he never made it there for a decade and it was worth even more?
No, of course you didn't think about that. You thought about how you personally would rather have two singles, a quarter and some pennies because you're:
                 1.) (guessing here) 11-teen years old and that's how your mind works
                 2.) Incapable of sitting by while someone says anything you don't agree with
                 3.) Or more likely not capable of having a discussion that goes beyond immature examples that attempt to sound cool.

You are ~~literally~~ [figuratively]( the best.

It wasn't and more to my point it didn't address what I said. Tipping isn't mandatory and isn't required at all. Complaining about any tip is being ungrateful and childish. An employee is paid an hourly wage to perform work for the company. Period. Tips are for doing something above and beyond the expected level of work, not for doing the job itself.
As for the analogy, it wasn't an analogy at all. An analogy compares things to try and explain the more complex idea. His comment was an attempt to degrade what I said. If he wanted to point out possible hurdles why not simply do that instead of exaggerating a story about going into a different state? Giving someone, in person, an item they can use (maybe with some effort looking it up, oh my gosh! A little reading and time might be required!) isn't close to traveling to another state.
And again back to my point. How about he doesn't get anything as a tip at all! You showed me. Keep that attitude with you in all endeavors and I'm sure you'll be greatly successful no matter what comes your way.

Account less than 3 weeks old and EVERY post is from two crypto websites...
And posts about the "price spike" while it is dropping 5% atm. Lololol
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:11:55
Another amazing user on Reddit showcasing their worth to society. Great job buddy.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:18:37
The title of the post is misleading, the article talks about Chase refunding past charges that were extra and specific to crypto purchases.
