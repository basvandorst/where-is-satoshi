Bitcoin certainly had a lot of impact in countries/states where gambling is illegal as well as help with avoiding taxation and such.
It is a great tool to get your gambling fix without having to worry too much about these things.

How is Bitcoin like Prince?
They both die young. /s

Coming from an accountant's point of view this is exactly why Localbitcoins will never go out of business.
It is simply the best option if you want to go down that road of laundering, tax evasion and staying anonymous.

I love seeing less economically devolped countries adopt bitcoin more and more.
Not only does it help bitcoin grow and go mainstream but it could really help countries which have devaluating currencies.

I personally think Bitcoin is merely a 'test' for the future monetary system put in process by the same people who control the system now.
In some years we will see Central Banks put out their own cryptocurrencies instead of the current fiat money. They will have 100% traceable transactions for every single individual.

The problem is a lot of people currently get in a lot of trouble with the government for cryptocurrency-related activities.
They crack down hard on not reporting taxes on gains for example.

Regulators seem to be held back and does not seem to keep up with the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies. They still cannot even agree wether to see it as a currency or a financial asset which currently leaves it in a limbo. This results in a dangerous minefield within business, financial and tax law.

I have worked with regulators on subjects related to cryptocurrencies and it is an absolute minefield at these times.
