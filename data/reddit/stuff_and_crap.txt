Thanks for elaborating. The faq is just so dense, halfway down the page my eyes glaze over. Guess I just had to have it explained differently. 
 I love Rogans podcast but haven't listened in a long time. I'll definitely look it up.

aka prices go up on everything involved. everyone wins but the consumer.

Makes sense putting it that way but I still can't see the average person, especially American transition to such a deflated pricing. i can already hear "2,000 bits for a coffee! rip off!" when its actually a fair price. i think theres going to be some issues in 'marketing' some of these concepts to the masses, but I believe it will eventually happen.

I understand how that works. I lived in Korea for a year, got quite used to increments of 1,000 won. I'm just discussing how this would work in a situation where bitcoin is accepted almost anywhere alongside cash, and whether most people will be able to understand, even the 'lowest common denominator'...education will definitely be a factor.

Coinbase.com! Powerful and easy to use. The fact that it looks like an online bank made it easy for me to get into bitcoin.

Makes sense thank you

makes sense. brings up another question : if it is so difficult for an individual to hoard coins, whats to stop a group in colluding to make it that happen?
@_date: 2014-10-15 00:50:12
Very cool thanks!

Coinbase nice! I've been dropping a few bucks here and there since August and I have .40 BTC now. Also it seems like not much now, but when I realize that spare cash might have been spent at some bar on a drink, it's worth it. Also try using coinbasis.net to track your wallet performance.

I want to use it in my daily life but no one takes it. I'm sure they'll change over eventually but I get screwed as an early adopter by creating a wallet and losing money. 
To piggy back on that, the average person had no idea how it works and their eyes glaze over when it is explained. The only thing that tends to get their attention is the fact that bitcoin screws over credit card companies but they don't want to understand how.
