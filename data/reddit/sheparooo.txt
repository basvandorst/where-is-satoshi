any transfer from a bank takes 7 + days in the past months , must be new
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:26:04
im selling if it hits 16, then ill just wait for it to hit 13 again , and repeat
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:00:03
probably not anytime soon, unless something major happens. the hype train is over and this is the settled price. I wouldn't be surprised it goes down further as more people start getting out
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:23:24
this is a repost or stolen cotent because this posted yesterday

I think it's safe to expect peaks and dips . But even if you sell a little early and miss max profit, you will still profit more than just holding constantly. The only people who really can predict the market are the theoretical whales and market manipulators

bitcoin is speculative value , its value fluctuates every minute based on the number of buys and sells . you be better just to go on youtube and type in "explain bitcoin". if you want to invest , I would just put in 100 dollars and never look at bitcoin prices. check back in and year and see how you did. if youre expecting quick money, that's not going to happen right now
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:31:56
its because they are backed up. could also be due age if youre under 18. i verified my kraken account in 2 days this week. coinbase took about 1 day when i did that . nows not really an optimal time to buy anyway
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:13:57
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:47:27
yea . you thought they just did all this for fun?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:59:18
bitcoin is a perpetual bubble of price manipulation . ppl arent investing in bitcoin they are flipping the dips for quick profit
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:06:45
This is a troll but obviously the answer would be sell your cryptocurrency in exchange for your local currency
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:25:49
btc will never stabalize unless it is used for everyday functions . its only value atm is speculation regardless of the tech its ultimately worthless if it isnt adopted. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:46:03
coinbase allowed me to verify without an id . i just entered my social and confirmed details 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:11:18
I use coinbase USD wallet so transfers are instant. if you would have sold out at 19k and bought back in at 12k you be rolling high 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:28:36
yea its not like.... literally everyone else does that same thing
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:24:00
I would just wait... why would you pay 45 dollars just to get 25 dollars
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:40:40
lol. glad u posted this lol. *lol*
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:43:18
nah im good
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:45:53
well if you sell , wait for dip, youre able to buy more and make profit without spending more. if your not into the playing the game that's your choice
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:28:33
you log in, and trade usd for btc its not a trick. pretty much anything under 100 is completely a waste because of fees . idk what you mean by a list? you just buy btc in any amount theres not like a big secret
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:45:29
Coinbase automatically sells you at a high price and buys at a low price to ensure they don't lose anything. They will never give you the realtime price
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:19:54
the btc network is overcrowded. transactions are now taking exceptionally long. don't be surprised if it takes a week
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:19:31
it would be a string of letters and numbers, if its a chuckie cheese coin your friend is an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:50
andddd its gone
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:57:15
yea. Coinbase takes 7-10 days unless youre using your USD wallet or card
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:45:31
mining, selling drugs, or just trading currency
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:40:55
because of kangaroos?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:47:40
if a few people owned all the bitcoin, bitcoin would have no value
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:40
well u can buy things with bitcoin on the darknet which you cant do with USD, so you are wrong 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:12:47
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:05:32
if you have the time to keep up always sell at peaks. then just buy back later . pretty sure most people are already keen on this but as long as the swing is around 15% you should be pulling justifiable profit 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:20:37
i think there are some places were you can buy from individuals with paypal. or there used to be. extremely sketchy though. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:24:06
theres a website you can sell gift cards for cash, albeit you lose money that way
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:56:00
buy it all at once, but buy it at a smart time

how lose customers 101
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:48:15
as much as you can afford to lose 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:35
i got in a buy abort
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:05:02
saturday  go check for yourself

gdax and coinbase are running a scam op
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:16:00
we dont drink champagne we drink andre
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:50:51
besides the point. its not the same as a gold currency where just because something is scarcer meaning it has value. there has a to be a market for it . 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:21:38
if you see the trend of increase, try to find a point were it dips back down to 11 or 12. if its only 20 dollars just throw it in now . worst case you lose a few dollars. if you really want to invest you should think about putting in real bets or youre not going to gain much
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:57:02
no - i deleted fb because of how uninformed people on there are in general 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:12
its been stagnant at 16-17 , id wait for another dip
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:57:17
thts what i told myself 3 weeks ago
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:30:21
you can do both. i think the amount of bitcoin adopters purely interested in btc because of intrinsic moral values and not success/profit is a minimum
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:17:47
i didnt read theonion until after the post 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:23:41
Where are people getting this fees from? I use coinbase and I've yet to see any thing above 4.99 for fees
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:19:27
does it matter if you make money
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:29
What??? My fees are only like 2 dollars
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:54:18
Lol. "after a small people acquire the majority of it". That's not how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:49:34
just wait a week? you dont have to buy now
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:09
depends what site and how much ? the same assumedly 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:26:36
its like 4 dollars a bottle
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:43:20
you should only do this if you have a lot of money to wager and lose. day trading off 500 isnt going to be worth the risk.  load up like 2000 into a wallet so you have instant transcations and try to flip the dips
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:45:45
nows not even a good entry point 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:25:33
something doesn't sound right here. you had 1.0 btc? like 15,000 dollars and you just accidently "traded it"? What 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:53:39
exactly why bitcoin will never be owned by a "few"
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:18:26
if only 3 people have bitcoin, who is logically going to buy it and for what purpose? the value would not be increasing just via magic. there would be no selling 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:47
get a job
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:21
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:25:52
hold up just put 2 more skill points into my psychic buff
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:15:47
yea you are the only one who looks for dips 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:39:53
delete this too. the fck even how is this relevant. what are you some meme magick chaos wizard? no. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:14
no, youd have to liquidate it
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:36:54
theres a noticfication about orders being backed up
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:46
idk dude why does the USA and Britain have different currencies? WHY WOULD WE NEED MORE THAN ONE CURRENCY IF ONE CURENCY CNA DO EVERYTHANG
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:28
when its 14 ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:49:18
sounds like some pretentious shit i would have said in high school
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:02:24
over the weekend *
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:49:25
if youre planning to "risk" alot of money, best do your research. otherwise might as well go play blackjack
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:27:38
have you tried verifying your id you can make sales faster
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:08:49
its a huge risk right now. its either going to fall back to 9k or shoot up. its gambling straight up. you can wait it out and see if it dips but you might just keep missing the bus
watch the price every 15min for the next 3 days and pick an entry point
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:17:07
well glad to hear you did your research before dumping your life savings
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:21
s h o o k
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:56:10
its worth it for your portfolio, dont like put all ur life savings into it and dont expect to suddenly become rich off 100 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:06:12
so u make a coinbase account. link your bank, open a transaction for 5 dollars, pay 1.99 in fees, net 3 dollars in btc, sit on it a few months, now you have 4 dollars in btc, sell it pay 1.99 fees, now you have 2 dollars. don't waste your time
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:38:38
why are you transferring bitcoin whats the need? leave it on the exchange or sell it to avoid fees. you can move usd to your bank account free
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:09:57
I have no idea. I don't follow it like that, but I don't think anyone really knows. Investing in some senses is gambling
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:50:39
it dips 1000 dollars and you panic sell and feel intense shame for the next 2 weeeks after having bragged to your mates ablut your new investment 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:54:39
you wait for the dips and start panic selling 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:21
i think the othe exchanges are scamming ppl tbh
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:58:04
it was 13 like 2 days ago
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:24:52
so apprently now becoming successful makes you racist too. its a great time for white ppl 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:10:34
oh , didnt used to be that way i would just avoid it for now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:50:33
that sounds like a bad idea why would anyone want the potential to lose money 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:50:04
your math involved assuming the rate of minimg stays the same and technology doesnt improve
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:38:49
card transfers are supposed to be instant but the limited is very low, bank transfers take up to 10 days, but if i remember there is a third option on the app like"USD account" that also says its instant but doesnt have the same limit as a card
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:56:07
2060-2018 = \ = 80 im starting to have concerns
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:41:23
my math says all coins will be mined well before that
@_date: 2019-03-25 07:09:55
Coinbase already has the bitcoin they are exchanging it to you
@_date: 2019-03-25 07:46:39
yes for the most part 
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:28:50
Youll probably want to get a wallet that middle mans with banks. While the deposit will be discreet usually these sites require you to register with social security type info. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:03:42
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:08:51
its actually really easy to buy what are you talking about
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:06:18
if it dips people will mass buy and itll go right back up
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:21:44
lol. its been around for years
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:42:19
click your accounts tab on the app then click wallet. if you used a bank account it takes like 5 days
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:35
fake news
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:48
yea I just kicked out of the app a minute ago, and it wasn't working properly for the last 15 minutes before that
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:13:09
You didnt think this through did you? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:49
logic tho
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:13:43
well last time it happened today everything crashed from over activity so goodluck
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:08:47
i had one bank who would call me whenever i would deposit to coinbase , it could set off an automated alarm if the amounts are even incriments but at the same time i buy stuff from china frequently and nothing happens 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:36:15
"just" youre late by about 2 hours
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:59:31
the whole market is down stocks as well
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:02:23
what 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:52:10
probably . same way people who own companies hire their own kids
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:31:49
100 x 0 = 0 confirmed
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:22:51
her dad probably made it - trying to kick start his daughters career. probably wrote all the posts too. wouldnt be surprising at all
