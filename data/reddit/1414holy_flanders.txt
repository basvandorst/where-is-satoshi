They do. Perhaps it's not available on mobile?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:07:20
Well, I can't do any more for the next hour anyway, so I guess I'm done for today.
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:35:40
You can only use bitcoin for one-time purchases, not subscriptions.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:20:08
I'm not trying to collect anymore (I also can't), but I am still watching the thread.
Edit: I seem to have replied to the wrong post.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:04:12
I clicked it too and it says it was successfully collected.
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:30:47
Awesome! Happy Thanksgiving, man!
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:01:30
One dozen lint in my pockets.
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:17:47
*throws a quarter at you* @_date: 2014-12-05 04:14:57
I'll share. Have a quarter! @_date: 2014-12-05 04:09:52
This tip collection was brought to you by the letter "p."
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:03:18
Let me help you out. 
100 bits
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:41:10
Have a nickel @_date: 2014-12-04 01:01:15
I actually did it in keyboard order, so D was sort of in the middle.
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:55:41
Aww yeah, pocket lint!
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:25:12
Well, this is absolutely fantastic. Changetip is a great way to introduce people to BTC. 
It's how I got into it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:59:31
Yup, I'm done for real now, though. I've put off my video games for far too long.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:10:17
Yes, it's a new feature that was added a couple days ago.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:01:09
I clicked it and it gave me an internal server error.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:55:14
You are just going all out with these.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:01:10
13 lints!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:49:11
Nice, I actually managed to snag that one!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:34:42
Oh hey, you're the guy I tipped a nickel to earlier!
Wait... maybe I shouldn't have collected that.
I'll forward it:  nce/GwDB-9itfx9 zG
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:55:15
I gave it the D
(I know I said I was done for the day, but I can't resist this thread)
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:23:49
1 compensation.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:53:10
Yeah, I kind of figured that, but I wanted to throw it out there anyway. It would at least introduce more people to the sub, if nothing else.
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:29:46
That's pretty awesome. It's crazy how much of an impact ChangeTip has been making in the past month.
 Sadly, I think I missed out on all the tipping action.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:53:00
I'm here, I was just checking a thing.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:47:42
I love the smell of pocket lint in the evening.
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:11:14
I think it's because a lot of people see this as being a bit of a circle jerk. 
Screw those guys, though.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:27:03
I think it's closer to 7.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:47:52
I'd try @_date: 2014-12-05 04:15:16
Need a quarter here! @_date: 2014-12-03 23:59:25
I don't think I have much F5 key left.
