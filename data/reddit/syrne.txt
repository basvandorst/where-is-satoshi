When the price goes up: fuck that I'll wait until it drops and buy in!
When the price goes down: fuck that, bitcoin is dead! Long live (alt coin flavor of the month) 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:54:39
Accepting that premise then we can't count this BTC drop because the whole crypto space corrected no?
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:07:58
Why not take the match and just pull it out after it's vested? Leaving essentially a 4% raise on the table doesn't make much sense. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:47:48
It's not anonymous so I don't know if you have really read into the technology at all to be making broad assumptions about it's value. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:31:51
But if you had sold when bitcoin was experiencing that rise you may have sold off back at 2k when people were saying no way it will go higher, or when it was 5k and people were making jokes about eating their own dicks if it hit 10k by the end of the year. No one was close to predicting 19k so what's to say it wouldn't keep going up from there. Easy to say read the charts in hindsight. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:07:58
Didn't say you weren't allowed to, just that it's not apples to apples. Didn't realize the goal post had moved to largest market cap stocks but AAPL dropped more than 50% in a single day back in 2000, certainly before they were as big as they are but it's not like stocks are immune to big losses.

Sour grapes they missed out. I don't know what it is about anti Crypto people that compels them to constantly talk about how little faith they have in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:50:14
There are plenty of stocks out there that you could lose 40% on over a couple months. Comparing it to an index fund isn't really apples to apples. Neither is comparing it to a stock though really. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:00:03
Sure but I wouldn't go to a subreddit dedicated to it and get involved in discussions if it got on my nerves. No need to seek out negativity in the world. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:58:57
Amusing sure but I wouldn't go around constantly shitting on people for it. Why do I care what other people put their money in.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:54:22
The transaction should be rejected after 2 weeks or so. Are you sure it's been that long? Sometimes a week feels like a month in Crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:44:55
You're in luck, greed is only the 4th circle! False prophet's get the 8th and I suppose you could make an argument for the 9th with the betrayers.

Absolutely, look at your grandparents or great grandparents that grew up during the great depression and lost their asses. They probably have a stack of cash stuffed in a mattress or a hidden safe somewhere because once a bank says 'sorry we're out of money today' you tend to lose faith in the system. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:03:41
No way to reclaim it which is part of the appeal, as more and more get lost it will ideally push the price even higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:57:40
Looks a lot like [this] ( surprisingly enough.

That's how most AWD systems that aren't in Subarus work. They are FWD until they detect wheel slip and the system engages the other two wheels.

Yes tax evasion is possible and attempted every day. Most people probably even get away with it, but if you do get targeted for an audit you might want to have a better story than 'I lost those bitcoins'. Just remember Al Capone did a lot of illegal shit but it was the IRS that got him.

Well there is his problem. He wasn't thinking big enough. Had he laundered billions he would have been considered too big to prosecute.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:11
Do you get the 18 years of interest growth as well? That would really suck if you just got out what you put in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:03:42
I'm not sure if there have been any legitimate 'hacks' that haven't involved either trusting a third party, which kind of defeats the whole point, or not being careful with backups and basic IT security. Maybe it's because it still feels like magic internet money to people but you wouldn't just leave your gold or dollars with some unaccountable third party, so why trust your bitcoin to one? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:17:37
Eventually people will realize what everyone is talking about when they say if you don't control your private keys, you don't own your bitcoin. Don't leave them on an exchange especially when there is ample lead up time to get them off.

Perks of unregulated markets. This is a libertarians wet dream.

Capital gains tax is hardly an exclusively US thing.

Depends on your state and even then it's usually a pretty small amount and limited based on other factors. Always good to take advantage of free money offered if available though, but there's a risk there too, if the kid decides not to go to college for example. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:33:50
True but you are being disingenuous, he clearly doesn't mean manipulated in that way but rather market manipulation, the illegal kind.
Whether that's true or not you'd have to ask him for his evidence though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:54:40
Plenty of bitcoin is dead headlines over it's lifespan. Whether that's people actually saying it and believing it or just click bait is hard to say. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:08:28
Nah people don't get nearly as salty when someone posts a new car they bought which is also a depreciating asset. Lot of angry dudes projecting their own insecurities and poor choices in this thread.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:50:21
If anyone could answer this question they would be billionaires. If you can afford to lose it all then sure toss some money at it. If you believe in the long term viability of the tech, toss some at it and forget about it and check back next time you hear about it in the news.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:03:53
Where did you get those percentages?
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:31:24
Plenty of people with no BTC come around to talk shit at any price move. Goes up 'its a bubble and you guys are dumb for buying into it' goes down 'haha see it's crashing, Bitcoin is dead'. Really not sure why other than some people like to see other people lose money/fail at anything and gloat about how much smarter they are.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:34:32
That doesn't make sense, slaves don't get paid.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:37:48
Probably supply contracts and sustainability. They know the mining craze will likely fade like it did last time there was a run on video cards like this and then they'll want the good will of the people they didn't gouge back. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:48:22
There's no bottom end for short term capital gains tax, it's just taxed as if it were income. For long term gains its taxed lower or not at all depending on income. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:21:29
Meh people said it was ridiculous the whole climb up. This time, last time, the time before that. Fact is you don't have a crystal ball either. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:13:53
Simple has been good to me. Not exactly a credit union but so far they haven't been nearly as shitty as the big banks with fees etc. Don't know why your credit union is so trigger happy with freezing your account but I'd suggest just using a credit card for transactions like that and then the bank only for cash at an ATM which shouldn't trigger fraud alerts as much.

They are good but the segment is full of really good cars now. And you can't win when you compete with nostalgia, I'm betting the new Supra will have the same problem.
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:14:40
Might be worth considering a car from this millennium if you want to survive to enjoy the retirement.
@_date: 2017-05-02 03:44:31
That is intentional and healthy.

When you live with your parents electricity is free, duh.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:23:27
You could have said the same about 1k or 2k and been just as likely to be right. It will probably hit some resistance at 3k as people dump some to realize their short term gains but it seems like any downturns past 100 just gets more buyers hopping in pushing it back up. Not saying it won't crash or anything just that it's impossible to predict and even harder to predict the price it will happen at.
@_date: 2017-05-02 05:20:03
To your first point, for the greater good, invest it. To the second point, because of it's nature since it is not a fiat currency a government can't just print a bunch of it. It's not as if that is risk free either, it is speculative in itself.
@_date: 2017-05-02 05:36:26
Ok you're throwing out hyperbole now so I guess you are done with reasonable arguments. Have a nice night.
@_date: 2017-05-02 05:04:00
The price you pay to keep your money risk free and out of the market. Money has to keep moving or the economy grinds to a halt.

Happy to help! I'm just holding what I have for now and buying in a little at a time. For what it's worth I actually think it's going to dip this weekend with uncertainty and then climb after the first but I'm not throwing all my eggs at it on a hunch.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:57:23
Probably drop a bit over the weekend and then start climbing after the 1st. Or it will go up over the weekend and continue climbing on the 1st. Or it will drop over the weekend and then plummet the 1st before recovering in two years.
@_date: 2019-05-09 04:06:23
Don't let hindsight get you down. The crash was 'obvious' to so many onlookers the whole way up once it passed like 2k.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:18:43
You and your fellow citizens vote on what those taxes are used for. What was the heretical literature? I'd love to hear some examples of how ISIS would be an improvement though.

Hodl is a typo of hold that caught on as a joke. And fud is fear, uncertainty, doubt.
