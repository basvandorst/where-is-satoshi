Bitcoin goes up....Bitcoin goes down. However, watching Bitcoin go down while my transaction is stuck in the mempool isn't fun. Sent i15 hours ago and it is still there :(

Bitcoin Cash (Futures) (BCC)
$378.44 (34.05%)
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:01:22
BTC hasn't been credited yet. I would think they would need to freeze all accounts soon so they can do that. Big sale going on. Down to $2,664
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:29:46
It has been down most of the day. This morning I initiated a wire withdrawal. It has been pending for 9 hours. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:23:45
Ya. I am looking at my account and waiting to be credited. just checked worldcoinindex and it is at $372. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:58:41
Thanks. This worked.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:26:02
Time to sell?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:53:11
Can't trade right now. But, did anyone have a chance to see if BTC was deposited before it went down? 
503 is just a lot of people checking to make sure their Bitcoin is still there.

Big arbitrage opportunity. a couple of exchanges on worldcoindex have it over $300 and kraken is just over $200
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:04:25
Just got in. Give it a try
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:27:21
Kraken has been down almost 8 hours today. And, still no reason given on Twitter/Facebook. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:21:54
I made a wire transfer this morning and it is still pending. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:41:12
So was I. Thing is my wire transfer had nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash. It was just a regular Bitcoin sale and wire money into my account like I have done before.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:35:19
Checked my account and it has been credited. You might want to logout and try again.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:45:29
I was able to get in this morning. Sold some BTC and did a wire withdrawal. It has been on hold (pending) for 11 hours now. The money has nothing to do with BCH so I do not see why it would be on hold. Still nothing from Kraken.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:59:07
Same withdrawal I have done about 15 times. After the first one the rest took a couple of hours. It was also stuck on pending instead of completed. That means Kraken hasn't authorized it. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:20:51
Take a look at the Kraken Facebook page.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:46:34
I shorted your mom earlier today. :)
Keep going down. At 2,000 I buy back the coin I sold at 2,500.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:56:40
I applied 8 days ago and I am still waiting.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:48:04
I would expect some profit taking. I have some coins that I have held for just over a year and I have sell orders in so that I can take out all of my original investment. I would think others who bought and $400 &amp; $500 would also sell part of the coins they have. 
Just like any other investment. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:08:13
The "traditional media" reporting on Bitcoin does not have to be well informed. They just have to have a big megaphone.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:28:42
Just trying to see if it is worth it opening an account at CEX.IO to do some selling. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:52:02
Still laughing at you.
Aww. But you are so mad. Too bad. Don't really care. Yawn
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:51:45
Sorry for the delay. They finally approved everything. Just keep emailing them once a day to get things done.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:08:13
Since my investment has more than tripled. Even a high fee leaves room for a profit. 
High fees do stop it from being an alternative currency. But not an investment.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:22:25
Then why are you holding? If you believe it has no value then you should sell it right now.
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:23:46
Asked Gemini if there was a problem with my application. Received the generic we are busy response.
13 days and counting.
I am applying to several so I do get screwed again waiting on exchange to take care of things. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:10:38
Silly. Your lack of self control begets the hate of your posts. Obviously you lack a real life and Reddit and social media is as close as you can come to becoming a man. 
You must be alone. No wife. No child. No real desire or ambition to grow up and be something. Stick to your toys and your snark. It is all you will ever have. 
It is funny. How much you need to be "something" on a social media site.
Playing chess with chimps. Now hit the board and throw some more shit.

Move to Costa Rica and get yourself a place on the beach. Won't take long till you have a girlfriend.

Bitcoin has three financial uses.
1. Hold - long term investing. A $7 fee on a $2,500 profit.
2. Trader - transaction fees are part of the business. Just like day trading stocks. Also, tax deductible.
3. Commerce - Bitcoin needs low transaction fees for this. 
The market will decide which of these Bitcoin ends up as. 
As for your whinny "I really hope you sell and don't buy back in, ever. You clearly don't understand bitcoin." That is funny. It makes you look like a punk bitch. LAMO
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:14:43
Thanks. I will email them to see why it is taking so long.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:29:31
So bitter. Come on. Type something else that is snotty and condescending.
