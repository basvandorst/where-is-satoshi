Spamming in the software sense, not the email sense. If you are using a rate limited system, a primary requirements of how you operate should be to stay within those limits.

So TOTP is an open standard that google popularised, so the nickname is Google Auth but in reality it’s an open and interoperable format. Authy is a solid choice.
Ironically. Authy has their own proprietary version as well as TOTP that i think has an 8 or 9 digit long output.

Yup. I even try selling at a high and buying in the dip.
I have learned, one way of ensuring a currency can dip even further: buy some ;)

I am not recommending them, but check the graphing on Bitfinex for example, after being used to trading commodities, it has a more fully featured graphing system. Changes are immediate, it doesn’t lag behind the actual API price changes and you can add things like Bollinger lines or customise the simple moving average.
It also doesn’t have any of that low resolution monitor blurriness to it. GDAX only looks good on a low res display like an old laptop.
You can’t register on Bitfinex with less than $10,000 in coins going forward and they are shady anyway so I’d recommend seeing what else is out there.
GDAX is also incredibly limited in terms of how you can trade and the currencies available.
Plus it’s Coinbase who are terrible.

The only way BTC will moon is after I sell my coins. I should do you guys a favour. 
I am now so convinced after some recent alt coin trading that this is how it works
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:35:08
GDAX’s interface is awful. I was showing it to my colleagues (who also trade) when I was describing how ugly it is. The resolution is super low, the graphing is low res and unconfigurable other than interval...

I see your point and work in a similar capacity but I disagree. Security policy has to account for the lowest common denominator.
I think it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to use a unique password on every site and we know the majority of people do not use password managers. MFA is, from the users perspective a reasonable measure to take to protect themselves.
A good example of this, my name was found in the credits of a video game along with my job title, the malicious actor chose my account as they assumed I would have good privileges across the organisation, they used an exploit on our VPN to bypass my password however suddenly during a meeting my phone vibrated prompting about a failed MFA request. About 15 minutes later our SOC picked up suspicious logs in LogRhythm from our VPN endpoint. We later confirmed with the vendor they were aware there is a possibly exploit but had not moved to patch it.
This is one good example of MFA (although there are other checks in place that would have picked up on this malicious actor) but there are so many scenarios where it is common sense.
Although I am not using PCI DSS as a shining example of security compliance requirements, are you saying they are mistaken to require MFA?
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:26:08
We are not using sms MFA. In this example the 0-day bypassed the public keys on the vpn client.
If you do not let users chose their password they write them down on paper and keep them at their desk.

Sadly, even though I prefer android in theory I haven’t had an android in years and haven’t kept up to date with anything Android specific. Anything developed by Redhat I would recommend.

Also, read this on creating a good easy to remember password:
My preference is a passphrase, such as the second line to your favourite song, like “ifyoulikepinacoladasandgettingcaughtintherain”. I actually  make fewer typos when typing it than something like “InS3cure/P4ssword&amp;”

You say the people ignore it like the $10,000 limit wasn’t introduced today.
They also have what seems to be a liquidity issue, there is now an entire subreddit dedicated to people who have tried to wire transfer out large sums of fiat to never receive it and be ignored by support.

Outline for religion:
The 5 Pillars of Hodlam:
1 - Coinhada: You must profess There is no coin but bitcoin and Nakamoto is our prophet
2 - Fasting: HODL even when you are hungry to sell
3 - Pilgrimage: You must try to attend one Antonopoulos talk in your lifetime if within your means
4 - Prayer: You must check the stock price of BTC at least 5 times a day.
5 - Charity: You must donate your knowledge to those less fortunate than by spreading word of this technology and religion.

Rare and unusual attack methods? The most common form of account hacking is credential stuffing and a recent study by google security researchers showed there’s very little they can do to prevent this.
I can’t tell if you’re trolling.
This is quite a naive point of view, Security is organised into layers of responsibility. The user, who can do nothing to secure the underlying system is responsible for ensuring that others cannot authenticate using their credentials.
2FA is common sense, standard practice and I recommend you read up on why it’s in pretty much every modern security standard and system.
You must never assume just having a strong password and keeping it safe is enough. There’s an endless list of reasons why this is the case. 
This is why most developed countries have chip-and-PIN on all credit cards, the card number is the primary form of authentication and chip-and-PIN is a form of MFA. You can try and keep your card safe but there’s very little you can do to not get caught out by a well concealed card skimmer. 
The same goes for malware and key loggers.

Edit: this was way longer than I intended.
Firstly, I am a huge proponent of FOSS, don’t get me wrong.
I wouldn’t recommend this over the two I mentioned for a few reasons:
Any security product like this should ring alarm bells if it’s forked due to lack of maintenance, this nearly always relates to project that have few developers from the beginning with little oversight and due diligence. The more people involved with a project the more eyes on the code finding vulnerabilities.
I would be suspicious of any forks, there could be malicious code and I don’t have the time or expertise to verify, so unless this is EXTREMELY popular I wouldn’t touch it.
I wouldn’t use a little known security app recommended to me by someone from a crypto related subreddit.
I would always try to never use packages or use security related apps that I haven’t found by using the Google Play or iOS App Store search. This could be malicious (no offence)
Unless it is a verified package in a Linux OS or for a well known project, I would push people towards a commercial product that will have a reputation to uphold and investment in security. This counts especially for non technical people.
Also, regarding KeePass, I would warn against a self hosted tool such as this for the same reason I would warn against having a PC based client, it’s trivial for malware to steal from. There was a key-logger that aimed at KeePass a while back. This defeats the seperation of Auth keys if you also keep your passwords on there.
