Yes, it's called a hard fork.

On rbtc eveybody's a "shill", here everybody's a "sockpuppet". You guys and your name calling...
Then enlighten me, who is this largest contributor that doesn't work for blockstream and how much of an influence do people who work for blockstream have on the project?

Of course writing tests is important for the project, I'm sure he's great.
What I'm asking is if someone wants to add/change some feature to bitcoin (segwit, 2MB blocks, ... ), who get's to decide if it will be added or not?

Don't core developers work for a company? Are you saying Blockstream is attacking bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:57:09
Ok, maybe we're talking about two different things.
I'm talking about the actual bitcoin project on github.
I'm not saying there's one person who is in charge, maybe they use majority voting or something but blockstream can definitely influence this, and the question is how much?

Thanks, just found this thread that confirms this:
But as far as I see John Newbury just writes tests, so he doesn't really affect much which features are in there. And Pieter Wuille and Mat Corallo (co-founder) are blockstream.
How do they really decide which features are included in the project.
Can blockstream prevent adding features they don't like?

Not everyone can commit to the repository, so some group is definitely in charge.
nvm, I don't feel like talking to you about this anymore, I'm gonna go.
Thanks for your time.

Yes, I understand anyone can fork the repo and run whichever client they want. I was interested in the core repository.
The CONTRIBUTING.md looks like it might explain it more. 
Thank you, I'll look into it.

You didn't really answer the question.
Ok, so someone decides they want to increase the block size to 1.3MB. They "know" that works and someone else "knows" that it doesn't work.
**Who** gets to decide if it's added to bitcoin or not.
The 1MB limit is just an arbitrary number without any research behind it.
