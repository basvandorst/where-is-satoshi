Maybe time to find the place for one then?
Actually not, can't see any place in my home where I would like to have a rig.

I do not tell my wife out of love.
She would be terrified if she know about the pricefluctuation this year.
I will give her a value of a fifth our actuall networth the day I tell her. That way she only get positive news.

Forced to, yes. But we vote against bigger tax-cuts and would be horrified with anything that is close to USA's system.
So yes, it's actually choosen. When you are proud of your country's higher tartrate and look down at countries that don't care for inhabitants in the system, then you aren't just forced. You like your high taxrates and the services that follow with them.

Oh. I look down on the biggest economy in the world, usa. A country tjat doesn't care for it's inhabitants

A good question!
I have thought about how to solve inheritance of my little crypto, if we would see 2017-growth again.
But I have no answer

In what way is that deceptive?
Ok, it's taxpayed. But we do pay as much in taxes to healthcare as USA - from what I have heard and get free healthcare (ok, nearly free max ~€110 for meeting doctors and nurses + max ~€240 for medicine per year).

Got surprised and learned something when I was attended hospital. I had to pay ~$10 for food each day.
Was a bit surprised - even if it was around the price for only lunch at a restaurant.

Official announcement hinting it.
Not stating, but enough in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:56:47
No, but nearly every country in the world other than USA have some sort of free healthcare.
And still USA have more governmentspending o bc healthcare than many west-european countries with free healthcare 
Aka. USA's system steal money from sick instead of having effective and good healthcare

Welcome to Sweden (at least if I have understood the policy correctly).

Yes, I think it´s ok to speak about how much you make from your work.
Why shouldn´t that be ok? Your work and get something from it, and if you can help a coworker to get a fare paycheck ,why not? Or, if you are getting to little, why not give yourself the perfect edge when you talk about your pay with your boss next time?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:52:06
So what do you call it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:01:53
We are many here that ask for some sort of medical research. I could ask pineapple fund to donate to cdg-research, as I'm living close to that one.
But I think it's more fitting with anything in brain-research. It harder to raise money there than say cancer. No fully working kids that suddenly get sick and either die or survive. Just people who live damaged for there entire lifes disabled with things like epilepsy and other hard to understand symptoms. Usually it communication (in the body) which in my mind fit blockchain.
Another idea is to fund reaserch tools, programs that can make science better and faster. IT way to do research. If you find a company you could buy stock to keep them going at such good projects.

One of the many good things about unions (in Sweden) is that we report our pay to our own union (by free will), and then we anonymiously compare our pay with each other to get a fare deal.

It's ain't about insecurity. It's about not scamming newbies. And to not scare away people from crypto.
If a influential voice says doesn't think insider trade is a crime - then you have someone in the style of Trump on top.

It is possible to simulate a computer in Dwarf fortress.
So maybe there?
