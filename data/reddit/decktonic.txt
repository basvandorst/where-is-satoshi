There is a post on the frontpage of r/bitcoin insisting that any crypto besides BTC is totally worthless and shouldn't be bothered with. It has 363 upvotes last I checked.

Here's why I disagree: we don't want just 1 crypto currency. Competition is important for the currency market, and as the various leading crypto currencies mature, that competition will reduce volatility and make the currencies easier to rely on. I think people that understand this will look to support alternatives to BTC, and LTC has the best chance of earning that support.

Thanks for the personal attack, but when someone calls all alt-cryptos "pure speculation", that implies that there is no inherent or long-term value in the commodity. And I fully disagree with that.

I think you misunderstand my question. I'm saying that hypothetically speaking, before Bitcoin existed, would you have ever suggested that everyone rely solely on USD and all other currencies be abolished? What about when the USD was backed by gold?

And I am arguing that at least a few altcoins with a decent market cap offer an inherent advantage of reducing volatility of Bitcoin. That's the entire point of my post, which I'm afraid people are either not catching on to, or just disagree with.
