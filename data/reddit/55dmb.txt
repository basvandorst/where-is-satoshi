My advice is to find any way to get your money out of Bither as quickly as you can and don’t look back. It’s a shady company with arrogant and condescending devs. I deposited 2btc a year ago and couldn’t send out of the wallet. I thought ‘hey that’s weird but I’m sure I will figure it out - I’ll just leave it there since they said secure in five different flashy ways’
I have been trying to remove the funds for months to the point that I’ve learned how to code enough to understand the design of the wallet. Bither operates on an off Blockchain P2P network which is decentralized (this may be a necessary evil for some wallets and exchanges but Bither is the only one I know of that pushes it hard). Once your funds are on Bither’s p2p super mega ultra secure deeeeeecentralized network, they are supposedly more secure. Except you can’t track your transactions on their network as it broadcasts to the Blockchain. I sent the devs pictures of the funds and they accused me of making it up because apparently I have that much time on my hands. They will also tell you that you suck at explaining the issue even when you make a step by step PowerPoint pdf, and will ultimately say that “if you are speaking true this is difficult.” Reality jackass (the devs)?! Who is it difficult for the guy who lost 20 - 40k or the devs who had to stop call of duty to answer an email half heartedly.
So what happens in bither is you send out from the wallet on network A, which should broadcast to the Blockchain (network B) and make the transaction go through the normal steps. But what happens if it says on network A (Bither) that an address has 1 BTC in it, but on network B (the Blockchain) it shows 0 transactions and 0 balance. After serious work and hours with others helping - I’m thinking that it got moved by the devs at some point and I will likely never get a Bither send tx to go through. It’s the shadiest company with no support or instructions, and it’s either designed to be a halfass attempt at poorly designed software with accidentally outdated security standards and bizarre features that almost no other wallet uses (intentionally), or it’s designed to look that way. The question of sending tx’s with normal or high fees that never broadcast is everywhere on the forums. I’m convinced they took my money. If you can get your money out then start fresh with new mnemonic, and count yourself lucky

No coinbase just sucks 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:51:51
Yeah! Some of us need the therapeutic benefit of sharing!
Kidding...In all seriousness though, the coinbase problems should actually worry everyone who has a stake in bitcoin and crypto currency. It has become too-big-to-fail in a sense: that is, it isn't essential to bitcoin or crypto currencies survival, but major regulatory oversight, default, and shady practices at coinbase (if big enough) could have a deep bite on the global BTC market. Also it's a publicly traded company on the NYSE which means investor confidence would follow any collapse to coinbase. They don't need a bailout, but the bitcoin community needs to demand they clean up their mess, or any benefit we've enjoyed from bitcoin could face serious challenges (i.e. If we thought mt gox was bad...coinbase merely faltering a little or the senate demanding that they dump records would make gox seem like a fart in a stiff breeze compared to the pile of �� that would result)

Thanks for the advice, but most of all for the ref to the wallet recover site. If successful I will give you the reward (just FYI, I’ve had some interactions that were obviously scam ish and the support from bither has been sarcastic and condescending...they’re awful)

Good to know. I’m still in the cult, but having my doubts about the koolaid after Jobs died. I use a windows parallel on my Mac for a lot of BTC software, and I’ll give it a try. Thanks

Many thanks!

I'm having major panic attacks over my Bither wallet(s) right now. Similar question (I think), but maybe you can help - I can't get anyone from Bither to respond on the normal forums or twitter. I stored a few bitcoins on Bither a year ago, and had some major expenses come up recently. So, I decided to retrieve them. Reinstalled Bither on my phone and tablet (cold is on tablet - they were stored in an HD wallet though). I can't get any of the Bither wallets (cold, cold watch only, HD, Hot etc) to send to an address on the blockchain. So for example, I will send 2 BTC from the hot wallet to my regular BitPay address. Instead of broadcasting the transaction onto the blockchain, it moves the money to the HD account. I have basically been shifting the funds between HD and hot, but need them to pay for expenses immediately...is this a sync issue? can I import the funds into a different wallet using the xpub? Anyone...?
Really freaked out that I will be unable to ever access that money - and, do the math, it would be a devastating loss for me and my family.

No it will say that it sent but will not confirm...even after lots of waiting.

I’ve tried a few times with no success. Do you use electrum on Mac or windows...not sure how much I like the Mac version.

I’ve been in contact with them and it has been a really terrible experience. They’ve been pretty sarcastic and condescending, I’ve explained it multiple times with step by step screenshots, but they keep telling me to explain clearly (reading their github files makes me think they are using translation software like google translate for anything in English, so maybe a language barrier?). They basically concluded a really lengthy thread of emails with (not kidding) “your problem sounds difficult to solve” ...and that’s it

Thoughts on whether this will prolong bear trend?
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:16:38
Yikes...sounds like a super smart idea
