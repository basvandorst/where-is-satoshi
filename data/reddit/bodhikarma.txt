Different ways of understanding the term.  But I agree, we are talking around each other.

You don't think there aren't whales out there playing games with the bitcoin price?  Just because the people who have influence with bitcoin are different from people who have influence elsewhere, does not mean that bitcoin is not decentralized.
Fact is, miners are centralized and wallets are centralized.

You can be your own bank with any cryptocurrency.

Centralized wallets as in 1000 people holding 40% of the bitcoin.  You don't think those people are painting the tape, pushing bitcoin price higher?

Don't forget that if he sold at $5,600 he also ALREADY had an equal amount of bcash.

You think bitcoin is decentralized?  That's funny.

I bought my first cryptocurrency last April and got hooked.  I purchased cryptocurrency from coinbase, and moved it around through various exchanges and personal wallets, doing a fair bit of trading.  Somewhere between 100-200 trades total.  
At this point in time, I have cashed out all of my cryptocurrency, leaving me with a gain of around five thousand dollars in 2017 and three thousand dollars in 2018.
Now, I understand, that technically, I need to fill in my 8949 for all of my trades across all exchanges.  But since, I don't have a USD cost basis for those trades, I don't know how I could possibly do so.  However, since I bought everything on coinbase and cashed everything out on coinbase, wouldn't it be an accurate reflection of my total capital gains if I simply report each time I bought and sold on Coinbase?  
If I use this strategy, and the worst case scenario happens and I am audited, do you think the IRS would consider my behavior kosher and give me a pass?
