Is it confirmed that the message was actually posted by Satoshi and not a hacker?

Forget $200k. Let's imagine just $200. 
Also, what you seem to say is that someone has to be actively on the lookout for me. Otherwise, no one would care, right? 
And in any case, how about the Bitcoin millionaires? How do they keep safe?

So when Person A bets the odds could be 2.3:1, but when Person B bets a few days later (or just hours before the match), the odds are at 1.3:1. How is that fair?

Let's talk about someone else then. A random guy. We know Satoshi is the owner of that first chain...but imagine some random guy/girl whom we don't know the name. Let's say I have Bitcoin. I don't tell people what my blockchain is. I cash out. Can people trace to me? What if I had A LOT of Bitcoin (like 500) and cashed out. Could people track me? 
@_date: 2015-12-11 04:21:31
Ok, again let's assume I never made a public mention of 500 BTC. I never tell anybody it. 
I just transact 500 Bitcoins (or even some smaller amount, like 10 Bitcoins). Of course that transaction is visible to the world, but my main question is, can it be traced back to me (by way of IP address, transaction/cashout details etc)?
This is all a hypothetical question of course.

This doesn't add up. He had a very public LinkedIn profile. Nothing was done in secret. How come nobody in the Bitcoin community even knew/heard of him before?
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:26:54
Can the FBI really track you that way? If they can, why haven't they already found Nakamoto by now? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 02:43:30
Can this really be traced back? How? Genuine question. 
If what you say is true, why can't they use his posting from 2008 or before to trace him back? 
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:01:26
If he had liquidated some bitcoins, wouldn't people have been able to trace back to him? Can someone track your location if you liquidate bitcoins? How easy/difficult is it even to liquidate bitcoins?

It's perfectly reasonable that an alter-ego would be given unique linguistics.

Honest question: Are these "illegal" sites? 
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:23:17
But I thought Bitcoin was anonymous? Say Satoshi cashes out next week. Of course, people can see that a transaction happened...but can they really trace it/follow a trail? 
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:32:01
I think timestamps mean little. Most people who use the PCs for long hours playing games, hacking or writing/developing code do not sleep at normal times...usually they sleep early in the morning.

So you get twice as many coins? Double the profit? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:39:56
Isn't that a bit too crazy? How does money even work this way? Surely Bitcoin will be frowned upon after this happens, no? 
@_date: 2015-12-16 02:27:43
I am not from the US (will that be a problem?) and I understood not one word of what you said.
@_date: 2015-12-11 04:34:55
In a very brief manner, can you explain how it can be anonymous?
