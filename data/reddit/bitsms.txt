It is. Until and unless Government orders to share service records.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:11:34
Same. I have seen dozens of requests too, that's why I am considering this.

Anonymous =/= Spoof.
Spoof: You pretend to be someone else.
Anonymous: You just don't tell who you are.

It's not spoofing. It will be sent from a valid number, one (or 10) different numbers. Just that, sender will be unknown.
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:15:43
Hmm, okay. I'll stay. Some people might do this, but I'll try to prevent as much as I can. Most people will benefit with this.

I don't like Bitcointalk.org. That community has degraded a lot in the past time. :)
Anybody else is surely welcome to submit this link there. Or ask opinion there (linking this thread) and let me know the link, I'll check that too.

Not really. Much more secure and this thing only sends SMS to USA (+1).
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:28:59
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:22:43
Yes! Totally.

I'll make it $0.02 per SMS. :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:11:13
I'll lower it down. Don't worry. How about $0.02?
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:53:30
What? Why?
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:27:52
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:12:09
Come on. We do have quite a few anonymous services. (Plus, Bitcoin..)
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:00:17
Rate limiting, captcha (until you have sent a particular number of non-reported messages), and bot protection.
Yes, I know this might still be used as a spam machine, but still this will be reliable and worth.

This service will be send-only in the beginning, might roll-out dedicated numbers within sometime of launch.
Said that, I see enough interest.

Yes, I am looking for that IF this takes off, because this will require some money to establish, like $650 more. Right now, I am investing enough for this project. :)
