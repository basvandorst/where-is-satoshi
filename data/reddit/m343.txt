I've got to agree with here. Every extra dollar spent on electricity is a dollar that could be spent directly on buying bitcoins. If you need the price of bitcoins to increase in the future to simply *break even* from mining, that same increase in price could be captured directly as profit from converting your currency into bitcoins right now. And that's just the electricity. The return on investment if you purchase hardware specifically to mine is even less certain (unless you're sure that you will be one of the first to receive an ASIC).
Now, if you were mining for some other reason, like as a hobby, or to keep your cat warm as it sits on your tower, and didn't care about profit (or using more electricity)... go right ahead and start mining on your existing hardware. I can think of much more destructive hobbies to spend money on.

You were saying something about another round of preorders?

bookhockey24 and drawingthesun are both correct, in that lag is an issue when moving from one exchange to another, but not when exchanging money from one currency to another (and back again) within a single exchange (usually).
What nederhoed's referring to is [arbitrage]( the taking advantage of differences in prices on different exchanges/currencies/whatever to make a profit. 
Because bitcoin is not as widely used as other currencies at the moment, and because there aren't as many exchanges or methods to convert to/from BTC, there certainly is an opportunity for arbitrage, as the exchange rate from BTC to another currency, say USD, can be significantly different from one exchange (MtGox) to another (BTC-E). As I type this, theoretically I could buy bitcoins using BTC-E's exchange at 17.298 USD, and "immediately" sell them for 17.703 on MtGox's exchange, yielding a profit of about 40 US cents for each BTC traded. If I created a bot that could do this automatically, quickly and repeatedly, I could stand to end up with a tidy profit. As my bot worked, and as other people decided it was a good idea and did the same, eventually the prices among exchanges would converge. 
However, there are several issues with trying to do this in the real world right now.
First, not all exchanges have an API available for a bot (program) to be able to see prices and execute trades automatically. This doesn't put an end to the idea, as a human could always do the non-automated steps themselves, but it significantly slows down the process.
Second, even if you have multiple exchanges with APIs, you have to deal with the fees each exchange charges for transactions. A good formula could be used by your bot to take these fees into account before executing a trade, but it does make the circumstances for arbitrage more limited. 
Finally, you run into the problem of moving your currencies around. For a minute, ignore the above problems. Say I start out by funding both my BTC-E and my MtGox accounts with $1000. Human or bot, I buy $1000 worth of BTC at BTC-E's lower price, with the intention of selling at Mt. Gox's higher price. Simple enough for bitcoins, as I simply send them online from BTC-E to my MtGox account. Here's the issue, as I have to account for the "lag" of the transaction that you mentioned above, and potentially the fee I pay to have this transaction included in the block-chain. But let's assume that the price difference is great enough that the trade is still profitable, and that the price on MtGox hasn't changed enough for the deal to blow up on me. I sell my BTC on Mt Gox for $1023 (about right given the example prices above), and behold! $23 Profit! 
Now I have $2023 at MtGox, and $0 at BTC-E (again, we're ignoring fees). There isn't an easy and fast way to move USD from MtGox to BTC-E. So either I use the slow methods, or I have to wait until the asking price at MtGox and the bidding price at BTC-E are essentially reversed from the circumstances that allowed me to execute the first trade at a profit. And that might be even longer than it takes MtGox to wire USD to my bank account so that I can then wire that money back to BTC-E.
**Sooo...** Yes, the "lag" in sending BTC from one wallet to another would present an issue for implementing an arbitrage strategy/bot, but there are other issues that prevent this (at least as far as I can tell) from being profitable.
Now to bookhockey24's comment about how there aren't actual BTC transactions occurring, thus no lag. This is correct, but only if you're looking to keep all funds within Mt. Gox. The same strategy as above could be implemented while keeping all money within Mt.Gox, but this would involve speculation on the bid/ask prices inside the Mt. Gox exchange. This would essentially be algorithmic trading, where your bot watches the bid/ask prices, and is programmed to buy BTC under certain circumstances (when it believes the price is going to rise in the future) and sell those BTC (when it believes the price is going to fall in the future). Of course, you have to account for the fees that Mt. Gox charges for each transaction, and even with the volatility in BTC prices we've seen recently (always?), the "profits" from buy low, sell high, repeat, must exceed the fees charged for each transaction. 
The question here is: what formulas and statistics do you use to program your bot so that it accurately (and profitably) predicts the future of Mt. Gox prices. This is why statisticians and programmers have been so important to Wall Street over the past (5? 10?) years, as they are doing essentially the same thing. I don't fully understand the strategies myself, but it's my understanding that their computers are doing this on a massive scale, taking advantage of even tiny differences between market price and where the algo thinks the price is going.
**tl;dr:** Lag/blockchain not an issue if all money (in whatever form) stays within Mt. Gox's system. Lag is one issue among many in trying to arbitrage between different exchanges, hence the sometimes-significant price differences between exchanges.
