hi - I went there but to be honest it wants my bank details and such becuase I need to have an account. Why is trusting some program any better than trusting some website?

400 miles to drive from oslo to stockholm.... for 100 dollars worth of bitcoins?... y'know - the online currency?
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:08:02
then there is no point in bitcoin for me as a private person: Plenty of online methods such as creditcard and paypal are far more reliable with better guarantees.

We dont have them in Norway.

I think its VERY shady that people can point to dozens and dozens of websites, with varying levels of reliability and trustability... with absolutely no way for a new user to differentiate between them except by "word of mouth" from anonymous people online such as inhabit this forum.
All of those website pretty much insist on user registration and more or less require real world info: telephone numbers etc... and this is BEFORE we get to the actual transactions which will probably require going to some OTHER payment site and actually having to give private information - or else finding a private actor and having to give them my personal details. OR I can meet up in person with a total stranger who knows Im carrying cash in my pocket (for the record: I8 year old female and NOT interested in meeting Bitcoinmaster92). Besides this is supposed to be an online currency.. why the hell shouldnt it work online?
OR i can pay in some stupidly obscure way like amazon giftcards or steam giftcares or OKpay or Western Union... which is all complete rubbish because frankly those are either mickey mouse digital payment types compared to paypal and Creditcards which I trust BARELY.... or else annoyingly awkward physical transaction types - which totally negates the point of an ONLINE CURRENCY in the first place.
So yeah.. Shady doesnt even begin to describe the experience.

Im not sure if you completely miss my point?
I can go through your list but really theyre probably just more links to exchanges.. Ive already tried some of the more reliable ones such as Circle and such that everybody keep recommending. And sooner or later they will all ask for me to create an account and log in and add a password and then add an ID to verify etc etc etc... Despite the fact I have a credit card and a paypal I can use: But cant use.
Short of meeting up with someone face to face theres no way to simply transfer money reliably.. Everywhere wants personal ID.
And I have no interest in meeting strangers carrying money.

This site looks dodgy tbh.. I went in a few times and it starts the btc value at BTC €854.28
The it waits until the form is almost filled out and suddenly "recalculates" it to BTC €961.37
It did this the 3 times I visited.. And lets face it even 854 is a massive markup over the 650 or so BTC is currently traded for on most exchanges. 
So.. yeah no not gonna happen.

Im in Norway - We dont have any bitcoin ATMs.
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:24:21
ye I just figured that out :P 
This is kind of the problem with bitcoin..its all so shady. Which sites are trustworthy? Which arent? 
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:11:04
I understand the advantage for a trader ... but my point is that as a regular person its hard to see the benefits of bitcoins as a digital commodity.
@_date: 2016-11-06 10:48:14
So far this has been my biggest problem with bitcoin as a new user of it.. There are so many exchanges and so many possible ways to get started - but every single road I go down requires me to reveal myself in some way. 
I don't really want to meet a stranger on the street. I don't really want to have to photograph my license and personal papers and send them to a stranger.. I dont really want to have to trust someone I never met with more than I have to. I thought I would start learning about bitcoin for fun - and maybe put like 100 bucks into it - but there doesnt seem to be any way to do that without seriously risking ID theft? Or do I miss something obvious?
@_date: 2016-11-09 21:35:17
To be honest I found the absence of privacy going in to Bitcoin to be a major turnoff to using it. I got some pretty interesting replies here when I posted about it. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:08:34
for example.. but now I begin to see that theres no real point to bitcoin at all: I might as well just go straight to creditcard or paypal.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:10:06
I consider having to meet someone in rl  totally negates the purpose of a digital "online" currency... then Im better off just using paypal tbh. Im try ing to understand the benefits of bitcoin to a normal person (not a trader) and struggling a bit to come up with any.
@_date: 2016-11-06 11:35:49
A l,ot of what ytou said here goes over my head tbh. I think your first sentance is the only bit I understood :P 
"You could and many do just suck it up and use your IRL identity to purchase bitcoin"
Im a total noob in Bitcoin - I wont pretend to be anything else. I'm just finding the whole experience Verrrry shady so far tbh.
@_date: 2016-11-06 14:57:15
in my OP I actually mention localbitcoins. I think you're missing my point: With paypal and Creditcards I have already given up my ID to a certainextent - but to reliable companies I can kind of trust. I don't mind that. What I do mind is being *forced* to give my ID up again to shady online websites.. Look at the list above: All those exchanges want me to sign up and then Anyway Im going to have to  use *another* system that will probably end up asking me for a drivers license or something.. so what's the point of Bitcoin? Why not just use paypal in the first place?
@_date: 2016-11-06 10:23:17
But most traders insist on a verifiable ID? At least so far every single trader I've tried to deal with in localbitcoins has insisted on a copy of my drivers license - it seems so scammy to be honest.
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:37:06
I think the implicit distrust level of traders towards each other is a sign that the currency is more of a commodity that a currency. I now see it as more like a stock option that anything else.
