dogecoin is a fkn scam, stop comparing it to bitcoin, anything with dogecoin in title on this reddit should be banned!

Dogecoin is a joke and so are you for believing a joke.  If you want to go talk about your shitcoin, go post on your fkn r/dogecoin

What does the scam/clone coin have to do with bitcoin and why is this shit on bitcoin reddit,
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:17:33
Ya, because I started pointing out that all the positive comments were first time posters.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:28:20

@_date: 2014-03-23 17:37:44

@_date: 2014-03-22 18:01:37
Do you not know what a wallet is?
Trust no one!
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:35:13
And what are these serious benefits?
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:15:30
They damaged themselves!  Two people better be going to jail!
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:06:47
No need to lie because they knew what they sent was all like that!
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:40:38

@_date: 2014-11-14 13:38:21
thats not true!  Gerald Celente still claims to have lost his gold from there!
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:21:18
Ive bought lots of gold and silver from them already, shipped to canada no problems!
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:19:40

He made bitcoin look bad, NO!
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:56:51
I just did a btc withdrawal about 10mins ago and I had no problems, email came and deposited into my wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:15:24
Did you really think they were going to ROI??
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:56:46
No, bitcoin did that on its own.  He used it to profit illegally.  Bitmit did more for bitcoin, silk road gave us bad press.  When people heard bitcoin, they thought drugs, nothing else.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:44:14
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:55:08
This is the bitcoin reddit, are you that fucken stupid that you cant read?  All dogecoin or any other coin in thread title should be banned and reported! 
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:06:25
agreed, dont they have their own subreddit?  Why arent the mods moving those threads?
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:01:14
why would you even think about storing coins at any exchange?
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:31:49
invest only what you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:24:22
dogecoin is a scam coin plain and simple
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:49:57
I withdrew $2100 cash from virtex on Friday, money was in my account today.

Yes, you have 90 days warranty on the boards, but we will require the 18 broken ASIC boards back before we initiate any RMA's for these.
I will now place your controllerboard/beaglebone RMA in the RMA queue.

Many apologies for the misinformation. Before we can initiate any RMA numbers for broken parts, we will require the original owner of the order to contact us to notify us that he has relinquished ownership of the order and passed this to you.
Kind regards,
I am absolutely fucken speachless, 7 days fucking around.....
Im going to finish posting our conversation online to show people how you have just been fucking me around.  Knc is the fucken worst company I have ever dealt with and I will  Never buy your fucken products again

why are you even listening to mainstream media anymore?
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:40:38
im pretty sure this is r/bitcoin, put your shtty scamcoin adverts in your own reddit clown community
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:00:10
Im not totally sure but likely keylogger.  I didnt see what was clean out of the computer.  
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:46:26
btw, I do realize that they are gone.  I havent been following this part of bitcoin so I was just putting it out there in case there was a way.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:48:19
I dont believe the left or the right.  Its more then just the drug and hes no fucking hero of mine.  All drugs are priced to high. Reinvest, your funny!  btw, I live in Canada and Im not forced to buy insurance. For your information, there are lots of new drugs that the price is sky high that these drug companies dont give for free to the people who need them.  Many, if not most dont get properly tested for safety, they just get pushed through! 
@_date: 2016-02-18 20:54:14
They should all be in jail!!!

Doesnt everyone know about Kodi?
@_date: 2016-02-06 18:43:00
Sorry, I think I was the one who helped get it banned.  It was a great video.
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:30:32
he raised the price on a drug 5000%
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:44:27
I did read this somewhere, but I dont know where and I would be not surprised if this changes.  Thats if the price of bitcoin keeps going down.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:35:33
no more sales to small time miners.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:29:51
Your absolutely correct and I would go as far as saying that we should dump bitcoin and jump to a new coin.  Asic proof, if there is one.  
signed, scammed bfl owner, scammed knc frankenshit, and still waiting to make a $100 on my first day gridseed order.

antminers are a better deal at 4.25 btc, 180g/h stock and overclock to 200g/h
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:17:01
2 days ago, a friend of mine had to wait 2 days to get his btc withdrawal out.
 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:05:06
i strongly disagree, for the last couple of years i have already stopped buying from china.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:59:49
I totally agree with Mr E, Ive been doing business with Virtex for more then a year with NO PROBLEMS!

Im sorry, but after being an active reader of this forum for months, maybe a year.  The responses to this post made me finally sign up, nothing wrong with title of thread, very clear to me.  I do see 3 trolls though...thanks for the post! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:08:58
im sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:33:03
I do and I have, thats why I email him and not splash it all over the forums.
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:54:46
There will be a place for some of these altcoins.  Remember any one of these altcoins is BETTER then any other fiat currency out there.  There are some dieharder altcoiners out there, dont forget that.  btw, Im mining any and every coin I can.
