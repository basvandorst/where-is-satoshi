I live in my country, with my bank and my language. That's why I'm asking why I should use Bitcoin NOW.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:16:35
And it will be closed soon, like it happened with the Starbucks GC &gt; BTC service...

Another question: what happened with the fund for dorian?

ELI5 what's going on, please?
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:47:05
As I state above, I'm asking about why I should use Bitcoin as a payment method and not as a money transfer.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:07:07
My card needs a pin. Cards with pin and chip are difficult to copy, as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:45:52
That'd be the best case scenario that could happen. At least, instead of the keys being robed and still in circulation, those coins are lost forever.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:44:00
I was speaking about in-store transactions. Amazon has a really good fraud check, though. Plus, I use a Virtual Debt Card for online purchases, that I topup instantly via bank transfer.

This way we will flag it as a not secure site and will appear on Google Chrome like this:

Me and all my friends have it like this, with several different banks. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:14:02
So does that mean someone bought MTGox?
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:38:33
The thing is I'm going to do around 5k. Would that delay it more?
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:33:39
I've been using Bitstamp for a while, but since they are using that shitty KYC... I'm not anymore.
Maybe I'm gonna start using Kraken, but since VoS had such great offers these last few days...
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:35:06
Because Bitcoin is irreversible.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:34:10
I know it's not a phishing scam, but this way Google will flag it and new people coming to bitcoin who are being directed to MTGox, won't deposit money there.
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:37:01
Yeah, just like Bitcoin dies everyday!

Most places where you buy something digital don't ask for address. Sometimes not even for the full name. Just debit card number and cvv.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:09:39
This post is not about mtgox. Stop posting shit to beg coins.

Well done, guys! Finally it's here :)  
Some suggestions to improve for the next update:
- iOS 7 Keyboard (I see the iOS 6 one on my iOS 7 iPhone 5).  
- Ability to change the fee attached to a transaction.  
- Change the design of the amount buttons. You updated the whole app to a minimalist flat design but not the green and red buttons.  
Everything else is cool so far!
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:40:17
Unlikely to happen, really unlikely. If it happens, I'm insured. A simple error with Bitcoin aaaaaaaand It's gone.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:07:26
Those codes are to recover my Gmail/Google account, not my BTC-e account, which is what I'm worried about.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:20:56


So I can setup 2FA for the same site on different devices at the same time? (Computer, mobile, tablet...).
Thanks a lot for your answer! :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:07:02
It's up againx
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:32:05
This is exactly what I think.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:00:20
Wow... I'd better be waiting for the price to go up and sell on bitstamp haha
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:45:23
No way. Is it that hard to deal with decimals? There are lot of BTC &gt; USD tools, for those that can't do a simple multiplication.
To be honest, bitcoin community do not need dumb people. 
"Others find decimals off-putting", that made me laugh, like seriously?
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:29:29
I said as a payment method, not as a money transfer. I know the banks are picky if you don't have a reason, but that's because of the country and not because of the banks themselves.

1) In the end, you (almost) never get a true discount. Why? There are only a few (big) e-commerces accepting Bitcoin. The final price on a retailer accepting Bitcoin will (most likely) be higher than comparing prices on a website like Ciao.
2) Even if my payment information gets leaked, which is really unlikely, no one will be able to make purchases, since they need my MC SecureCode.
3) You are correct, it doesn't appeal to me.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:55:36
I don't see how exchanging between EUR &gt; USD without any hassle instantly could be compared to the proccess of Cash &gt; BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:23:43
I'm currently using Blockchain.info on my iPhone, so maybe I stick with it. Although I'd like to try Mycelium.
The main question at the moment is which mobile do I get? Because without a phone, I can't download the wallet apps haha
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:42:25

Still, every other sites are showing gox no support at all. It's something like what the BTC community is doing with Apple.
I think you should totally remove it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:17:26
We should request an AMA to the Starbucks guy. He should know more about Mark and Gox that insiders do.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:02:15
There's no more privacy, since all a merchant see is your shipping address, which you have to give him also.
Maybe the billing address, but in my case it is the same.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:52:28
No, you are totally wrong.
It is true that I understand the value of the protocol and the potential of the technology, when there are thousands of fields to which Bitcoin is useful, while everyone is focusing on purchasing things with it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:24:30
I can't stop laughing at the guy from MIT that purchased 250k worth of goxBTC hahahaha
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:14:13
A few inputs/suggestions:
- Make it mobile friendly and good-looking. A nice minimalist them would be awesome.
- Put a BTC &lt;-&gt; USD converter, which the ability to choose the market you want.

The MTGox is not a sub problem. It's all over the WWW.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:55:13
Time isn't a problem as far as I get paid in the end. I was checking that thread right now... Not sure if I want to sell my coins there.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:23:13
The thing is that being a day-trader sticks you to exchanges and you need to have your coins there. Otherwise, trading would be a pain in the ass.
Also, withdrawing all the different cryptos overnight and depositing in the morning, would be a really big hassle.
Of course, I agree that if you are holding them for long-term, using a cold wallet is a must.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:06:49
What the fuck? The price is going down on Mtgox only. BTC-e always have fluctuations of ~20$ from time to time. And bitstamp is still on 620$, so stop saying bullshit and research before talking.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:41:46
Not again, please...
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:08:47
TL;DR please?
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:44:00
Bitcoins are ran by hackers and illuminati. That's why they won.

Just in case they remove it:








@_date: 2014-02-25 09:11:30


What does acq mean?
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:49:03
One word only.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:17:41
Where? That's a 20% discount. I doubt a legit seller earns 20+% on top of the Xbox price to give you such a discount.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:23:37
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:28:40
I want to use them because the price is higher there than on any other exchanges..
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:08:51
Still not money enough to pay for all the coins they lost.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:35:43
Well, if someone who doesn't give you your money isn't a scam, then tell me what it is.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:49:20
Finally they did it! Too bad they haven't completely removed it tho :(
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:27:05
Any price behind 1k is a good price, as far as you don't mind waiting a few months.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:42:22
To get Bitcoins, you need to signup on an exchange (yes, you can buy on localbitcoins, but that takes more time than signing up for a bank account). To sign up to that exchange you need to give your ID (bye, bye privacy) and verify your bank account (ironically). Bitstamp has ridiculous KYC requirements.
Paying with cash is simple enough and a few cents won't do harm if you are friends.

You should use a darker font on your mobile version. It is almost the same color as the background and it makes it really difficult to read.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:41:22
I really dislike Paypal, but if you send to Family and Friends (on the same country), there's no fee. You could handle them cash also or a bank transfer (free for me).

Since when do they charge 10%? My fees have always been 5% and I've been selling for quite a long time...
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:51:21
There should be a Starbucks nearer, and that's why they moved there.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:26:38
Money transfer: You send money to your grandma/friend/average chinese fake seller.
Payment method: You pay for items.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:32:34
I got these e-mails too. The same ones. A few times also.
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:16:33
Will it work in every country Just-Eat is?
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:15:48
Then what do they protect you against?
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:31:44
I don't think there's any point in doing that. I mean, the customer has no interest in leaving the money at limbo, as he can't get it back either.
Also, if he sends BTC from mobile, as far as I know, you can't configure it to have 0 fees from there (you do it from computer). Also, even if it have 0 fees, the transaction is still being propagated in the network, just that it's slower.
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:36:39
Why are people upvoting this? It makes no sense (at least for me).

I know withdrawing USD is not easy, but I've never heard any complaints about EUR withdrawing tbh... So maybe...
@_date: 2014-04-02 03:24:59
I have done what I was looking for. I think my coins are pretty secure at the moment.
I bought an android phone (Lenovo something, which is cheap and good). I opened a new blockchain account and made a backup which I saved on my encrypted pendrive using a brand new linux partition as intermediary.
For litecoin, I downloaded the official wallet, as I didn't know any reliable online wallet that doesn't store my private keys. Did the same to backup my wallet.
Now, the phone is hidden at home and my pendrive is in the safe, with nothing but the keys. I changed the extensions of the files to .jpg, .exe, etc. and of course the names.
I think this is a pretty secure setup and is really accessible and easy for newbies.
PS: I forgot to say the e-mail on my blockchain account and the blockchain account itself are both protected by 2FA.
This took me like 3 hours to setup and do everything, included downloading a Live CD and recording it.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:22:03
I don't type in the numbers or anything. I use a specific program, not gonna say which one, but kind of like LastPass where I store the numbers and the expire date. Whenever I want to checkout, it asks for a master password and when I type it in, everything gets filled. It just asks me for the MC SecureCode, which is like writing a password (3-5 seconds).
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:36:09
I enjoy hanging out with my friends, not making payments.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:05:04
Will you guys hold our keys?
I think that's a really important thing for a wallet and you don't mention it.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:20:25
I withdrawed two days ago a few coins in different transactions. Everything went smooth. I got my coins within seconds..
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:47:06
Nice. Once you release your wallet and some trusted people of the community or an auditory confirms that you don't hold our private keys, you'll have a customer here. Hopefully you also release an iOS app :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:21:22
It's just epic how there's no more inflation there. Almost all exchanges have the same prices at the moment.
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:35:18
Tell me your BTC address. I'll send you 20k BTC for 0.02EUR. You go first. I'm legit.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:23:56
Awesome thing! Although I already have the blockchain.info on my iPhone, an app that could be updated with new features would be wonderful!
I'll be sure to make a donation to the project once you release the beta version. Thank you so much for your hard work!!

You could have done so with your card.

Money is not the most important thing in your life. Do not hear to those critizicing you, but instead hear the people that give you advices and learn from yours and their mistakes.
Suicidal won't drive you anywhere, nor solve the MTGox issue or any other financial related thing. You want your money to please your children and wife, right? Do you think they'd like to see you commiting suicidal? That's the worst thing you could do. 
TL;DR: Ignore people on the internet and do not commit suicidal because of money.
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:54:48
We've got a problem

Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks a lot for the explanation!
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:28:10
I use it as an investment, for now.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:18:00
I laughed so fucking hard at this lol
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:49:04
As I said, I use it as an investment, but I want someone to convince me on why it should be used to purchase items, since that's what most people care about. This sub is full of news of: "My neighbour accepting bitcoins for his cakes", "This company no one knows about accepts bitcoins", "Overstock, Expedia, Newegg accepting bitcoins (10 news with the same content on the front page)".
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:56:56
But that's why I'm asking the benefits of using bitcoin as a payment method.

Nice offer. Anyways, it's a one time thing. People also give discounts if you buy something with a discount code from a promotion and so on...
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:02:59
Maybe he is waiting for something like Zerocoin to be implemented into the Bitcoin network, in order to move and sell his coins.
If he were to use his coins without something like the above implemented, bitcoin days destroyed charts would move crazy and people would panic sell, thus dropping the price of the coin.
Giving you an upvote. I'm quite interested in what people think about this.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:23:25
This is totally true and I completely agree. As I said almost 10 times on this thread, I'm aware of the benefits of using bitcoin for a lot of things, but I just don't see the point of purchasing things with it (myself).
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:25:08
So, that is: VISA fees + WU fees + Exchanger fees + Fluctuation of the price till we receive it (if we do).
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:45:13
Well, this thread is not about third world countries. I know there are loads of benefits for those countries.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:55:34

@_date: 2014-08-06 17:12:37
I said "as a Payment method", not as money transfer. I know bitcoin can be sent pseudo-anonymously and instantly, but that doesn't matter for item purchases online since you have to provide your shipping address anyways.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:54:53

@_date: 2014-08-06 17:06:11
I have never ever given away my ID to make a purchase. In fact, I gave away more my ID since I use bitcoin (to get verified on exchanges). 
All a merchant has is my full address and my full name, which is a lot less than what is needed to open a credit line.

Which bill are they talking about?
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:03:39
At least in my country, if you deposit cash or transfer to another account on the same bank, it's instant. If you make a transfer it's 1-2 days (usually 1).
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:07:17
Looks legit.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:20:26
Aaaaaaaaaand it's gold!
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:31:30
Oh, damn it. I won't be able to sleep today! :(
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:28:06
Mmm... Not sure why they take that long :-/
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:16:36
By exchange rate fee, I mean there's a ~0.5% the site takes (profit).
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:34:14
1 btc = 500$
Hahahahaha. Nice try brah!
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:57:25
So I send 100BTC to their Vault, login from a VPN and blabla, withdraw my BTC to another wallet and claim that my funds are stolen. Now I have 200BTC.
Is that how it works? lol
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:14:40
The BTC-E 102$ was a glitch. No one bought coins at 102$. There's no history of that coins being sold, as far as I know.
592$ is in no way "the 500$ zone". 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:30:22
That's why I wrote this post asking for a good android phone lol
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:18:16
Could companies like blockchain.info add their app to your app store?
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:19:47
This is fucking annoying. I prefer Bitcoin to be 100$ without China than 500$ with these fucktards.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:15:22
I fucking laughed so hard! Someone give gold to this guy lololol
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:07:06
She is sooooo cute! I love seeing BTC parents popping up haha
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:40:17
Anyone could explain what this exactly is? I know it is explained on the site, but I didn't understand anything lol
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:08:50
Don't use tinypic again. Ever.
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:31:39
Oh, I've just read you are VC and that you donate money to good causes. Well done!
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:55:24
I've never bought anything on an online shop that doesn't use a known and pseudo-trusted payment proccessor.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:11:57
That announcement doesn't have anything to do with MTGox: 
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:34:28
Who is he? How many coins he sold?
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:18:55
Perfect size for a new background.
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:51:48
My debit card is protected by Mastercard SecureCode, so even if the credit card proccessor is sketchy and save my info, they can't proccess anything without my password.
Anyways, I'm of course being careful on which sites I purchase and which ones not.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:56:27
I have some ideas for content:
Walmart - Best buy
Google - Bing
AT&amp;T - Verizon
Tesco - Another supermarket
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:00:36
I'm not from the US, but a quick Google Search lead me to Fandango.com and they don't ask for billing address.
I don't remember what info the sites ask me for, but I'm sure a few of them do not ask me for the billing address.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:14:54
That's not true at all. 2 passwords is all it takes me.
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:45:21
Paging so they know what everyone think about them. Me included. It's a shame they can't make a proper iOS app, when a proper UI wouldn't take more than 1-2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-07-29 10:57:09
VaultOfSatoshi, but not anymore.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:46:04
Just follow them on Twitter. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:12:26
When are they going to release the iOS wallet? -.-
@_date: 2014-01-22 16:51:54
That's why the  bot can tweet as much as it wants without being mentioned? Just tweet "Define word" and it'll mention you.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:56:18
Temporarily unavailable for a indefinite time.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:16:20
That's why I'm asking why I should use Bitcoin, and not anyone else. I purchase loads of things online and I have only purchased VPNs/Hosting a few times. So, that's not a reason to use Bitcoin or would you adopt another currency to pay for clothes and another one for food, etc etc.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:46:39
The fee is really really really small. Probably even worth, considering the hassle of signing up on an exchange, verifying your account, waiting, making a bank transfer, waiting again...
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:49:22
Do you really think huge investors buy on exchanges? They go through liquidity pools like Circle or OTC markets.
