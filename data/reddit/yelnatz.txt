Not to mention the revenue Lewt generates.
@_date: 2012-11-26 00:31:17
Such a hassle without a TD bank account. -.-
@_date: 2012-10-16 09:28:18
What am I looking at?
@_date: 2011-06-28 15:01:47
He sounds like a douche. lol
@_date: 2011-06-27 22:58:48
Hmm. Im new at this, can you help?
How do I install json for my box? Getting a loadError on the json part on line 2.
@_date: 2011-06-25 06:11:39
Ugh. Thats approx two 6990s which are 800 a piece.  
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:38:16
I already burried them last week.
@_date: 2011-06-25 18:07:59
No deposits right now.
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:28:07
That's what I thought at first and thought you were high. 
I guess I need more sleep.
@_date: 2011-06-28 05:25:09
There's no exchange right now that accepts CAD. 
So we mostly rely on  for buying and selling, but our process needs clearcoin and eInterac transfer. In a way protecting both buyer and seller.
Now, its gone. We can only wait for cavirtex.com to get out of beta; or do USD exchanges, which in itself, is a hassle. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:22:59
I support this.
(What? I talk like a normal person.)
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:51:56
Yep, my 100 dollar 5770 card can do 211 Mh/s.
@_date: 2011-07-11 21:03:33
I thought SR was taken down? Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:07:00
I just downloaded it. It's legit.
It does have your account info with your password encrypted, but from what I've heard its a weak encryption and can be cracked within a day. 
So change EVERYTHING.
@_date: 2011-06-28 16:02:54
I'm not sure I understand this post. 
Are you just displaying the mtgox transactions in a graph? Or is this a live graph that you can run and updates dynamically?
If so, hook me up.
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:28:48
Check the number of blocks in your client.
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:36:37
Is the rate only gonna get lower from here on out? Or is this just a phase?
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:49:07
Mine's constantly at 303~310 mh/s at 1000/300 with 65C. 
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:47:25
Thanks, its running now. ^^
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:36:13
Hey Cable,
Was just wondering if there's a website you recommend that sells starter mining rigs?
@_date: 2011-06-28 16:55:50
I wouldn't be complaining if they were still accepting deposits.


They're stagnant right now, and the pond is drying up. Hope they get their shit together soon.
@_date: 2011-08-21 13:09:39
Except for that one long explanation of what that rig is,
I face palmed all the way down.
@_date: 2011-06-28 14:26:35
Bitcoin4cash needs you to send your cash in the mail.
NanaimoGold buys your bitcoin at $5.
@_date: 2011-06-27 22:53:02
Are you on adderall?
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:21:33
Ouch. That exponential growth of difficulty each month doesn't look too good. 
@_date: 2011-06-23 21:20:58
Enough to cook bacon.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:30:40
Mt.Gox devs are probably shitting their pants right now.
Not looking good for them. I can't see how they're gonna roll back if people already cashed out.
And all those victims from last week are just SOL.
@_date: 2011-06-28 01:07:04
They also said soon last week.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:14:04
Bear with me. lol






@_date: 2011-06-15 15:15:35
Either way I am going to be buying a desktop for gaming. This will be around 500-600$.
I was just wondering if I should spend a few more for a mobo that has more slots, and an additional couple more video cards. Probably downgrade the CPU too.
@_date: 2011-07-09 23:07:18
I'm a senior undergrad com sci, and looking at this makes me feel like I don't know shit. :(
@_date: 2011-06-26 11:44:39
Just browsed the Australian ebay.
They seem to have gone up in price also.
@_date: 2011-06-25 20:28:33
Nice try, TradeHill.
@_date: 2011-06-28 05:01:52
Ugh. Canadians got screwed with this pretty hard.
@_date: 2011-06-26 08:13:02
Man, are people scalping these fuckers or what?
Topping $1.2k a pop on ebay. Jesus.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:13:43
Hmm, that's a good point. I do not pay for power where I live. 
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:18:24
That happens when ruby version is below 1.9.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:55:46
Exactly how I felt after getting 0.00005530 from the website miner.
One day i'll get a computer. One day.
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:13:30
I had to install ruby192 for round function to work; and thanks, I'll install it that way right now.
PS. How do you make gems? 
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:20:34
Well he commented on other stuff and the comments got upvotes.

I'm afraid I'm gonna look back 10-20 years from now regretting why I didn't do anything about bitcoins.
I just don't have any capital to work with. :[
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:24:53
Same here.
I looked at Paul's credentials, and I felt emasculated.
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:34:16
Second Life moves a lot of virtual currency. 
I love how open the game is on its policy with real money transactions.
(You can easily convert game money into cash and vice versa)
I'm personally excited about this.
@_date: 2013-05-20 09:15:47
I think you wooshed on this bud.
@_date: 2013-02-25 02:30:08
Still trying to make it happen.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:18:22
The waving motion is due to the fact that when the astronaut planted the pole he applied/transferred energy to it.
Since there is no air, it is harder to dissipate this energy thus it waves for much longer.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:02:31
Remember when 5830s were fetch?
@_date: 2013-05-19 06:23:10
Anyone know where to find the code? 
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:14:07
I see this? 
Not sure why yours is white on white.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:19:08
Can't get link karma from self posts.
