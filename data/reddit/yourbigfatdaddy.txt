Old cars in general burn more oil than gas. Try driving a 90s gmc denali. It's a rolling BP leak.

I send bitcoins weekly to my family internationally without any problems. It was designed for that, transactions,  remember?

I should clarify that I've also been giving the motor the wrong grade of oil for the past 3 months. Not too impressive,  since I try to take basic care of my car, but my car is 17 years old and has 262,609 miles on it. To have the luxury of giving the motor a fractional amount of the wrong oil, then expect it to travel at highway speed for a good few miles on a daily basis without any fuss is very very good luck.

We should practice telepathy.

SL's are a college student's best friend.  They're one of the only 90s cars I see on the streets nowadays, even more than civics or corrollas. I haven't changed the oil on mines for 2 months, and it's still smooth. They're built to last.

Idk, I don't usually get a freerection on but your post has caused that rare occasion.

"It is a money that is separate from the government,  like silver." That hit me. After knowing for so long that the power of precious metals breached political limits, I've never thought of it in that style. Technically speaking, back then, a few ounces in of silver in your satchel could buy you whatever you wanted across the entire world. The limits withholding humanity back then however were the customs of their cultures,  religion,  and their environment. This shows that bitcoin won't dismantle abusive governments, stop wars and create peace through constructive communication,  only we can choose that.
