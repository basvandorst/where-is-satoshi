I think it's good to be careful when it comes to the environment and our health. Medical and Food science are not precision sciences like particle physics for example. Before you get to the logic, you have to make many assumptions. So there can be a lot of bias in the results, intentional or not.
That's why I think people should be skeptical when they see things like "GMOs are safe" and "vaccines are safe". I would definitely support the green party if I was an American citizen. The only negatives for me would be that they support public healthcare, and having a woman as president (commanding the army), I don't know...

One person working alone (or in small group) can only do a limited number of damage to the environment. It's when people group together into these mega infrastructure projects (like a deep sea oil rig) that we get into problems. 1 human working independently cannot centralize that much energy into one small space (energy density) and thus has a limited impact on the environment. I'm not suggesting everyone be independent, just work in smaller groups (decentralize).

Yes Bitcoin can scale for _arbitrary_ transaction rates without increasing the block size. See my post here: 
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:50:40
It depends if you want decentralization at an individual level or organization level. I think Bitcoin should be decentralized at the individual level. Any regular individual should be able to run a full node. You don't have to run it in your home (if it's too noisy or takes up too much space), but you should be able to use any old shack in the middle of nowhere, run a node, and monitor remotely, _without_ anyone's permission and _without_ big hurdles. Same with mining.

Well first of all I don't think it's right to tell people that "probably storage will be better in the future", so you should be fine. This is not a robust system.

People have other things to store too.

Another analogy is this: How do you expand your business? By enlarging the size of the furniture so that only giants can work there?
No, I would enlarge it by building more branches and distributing the work over more space.
Yes, sidechains are superior to increasing the blocksize. But it's not really sidechains in the traditional sense, but synchronized sidechains, so effectively what you are doing is increasing the blocksize by dividing up that big block into multiple pieces, where different miners work on different pieces. See a more detailed description here:

Gavin doesn't care about scaling solutions that preserve decentralisation. His vision is having about 1000 world wide full nodes serving the whole world connected via light SPV clients. Even though this causes problems with miner centralization and politicians/corporations hiding transactions in the blockchain, and easy NSA-style monitoring of everyone's transactions, he doesn't care.

Well what do you mean by "node"? A node that only verifies and doesn't mine? Those nodes don't have any say on which block to accept. They just go with the largest chain. Yes there may be a small effect that small blocks will propagate more quickly on the network, but relative to the ~ 10 min target interval, a 1 MB or 20 MB doesn't make a significant difference. 
By the way I am against increasing the block size limit, I think 1 MB is perfect, but maybe if there is a way to incentivize miners to by themselves mine only 1 MB or smaller blocks, then I would possibly reconsider my position.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:00:02

Proof of stake means centralization (the rich keep getting richer). Proof of work means miners have to stay on their feet to keep working and attacks require a lot of work (energy).
Ideally, users decide on consensus rules and miners will follow the most profitable and stable rewards for miners. Now rewards are mostly block subsidies, but eventually, strong user demand will be needed for miners to keep getting paid by fees only.
Yes "investors" are part of the community too, but actual users have priority. If user demand is strong and stable, the price will be strong and stable, thus satisfying the goals of investors/savers.

You don't have to store all your keys in one place...and you can passphrase-encrypt each key with a different passphrase. 
Also, it's possible one is cracked for some reason (RNG weakness or random guess), so the others can still be safe.
Also, with individual keys you can distribute your funds over many keys, so that when you want to make a transaction, you can just import one to the "online world" and the rest will be safely offline.

The address contains a hash of the public key together with a hash of that hash (the last 4 bytes). So it is error correcting. If the last few characters of the address corresponding to that hash of the hash don't match the core hash, then the address is invalid. So I wouldn't worry about a typo. The client that sends the funds should detect the error and tell you. Am I right?

Having a paper wallet comprised of independent private keys is far more secure against theft than one comprised of a single seed passphrase or private key that can generate all the keys in the wallet.

I've not a core Bitcoin developer and I don't work for Blockstream, but I am a passionate Bitcoin user since 2011 and have developed several Bitcoin related open source projects including a paper wallet creator written in C. I am heavily opposed to the block size increase. Even 10 MB is too much centralization according to my calculations. Also, I have proposed a (soft-fork) way to effectively give Bitcoin an arbitrary block size without harming decentralization at all. It is the only way I know of. See 
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:21:59
I actually prefer that people don't trust it and build it from source. Of course, some people may not be able to understand the source code, so then you can rely on other people reviewing it. Anyone can view it and report it if they notice something wrong. Of course, it's better if there is many people reviewing it, and I can't give you numbers on this. However, please note that I have been working on Pirate Linux since 3 years (a project for the Pirate Party of Canada), and no one has ever reported anything wrong with it, as you can verify for yourself. Also, I included several popular paper wallet creation tools inside the OS (bitaddress, offlinewalletgenerator, brainwallet), so you can cross-check with those, or if you don't trust the OS at all, then run those on another machine to do the check.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:32:30
Well one reason that I mentioned in my link is that 10 MB means 50 TB over 100 years. So as a regular person, you cannot anymore be guranteed to have a record of the transactions that occured during your lifetime (on the main chain). This allows for government/corporate/whatever corruption to be hidden more easily inside the blockchain, away from the view of regular people.

Lightning will not affect fees. You can't have so much transactions on lightning, it is insecure, eventually you need to settle on the blockchain. There's also the issue of a settlement flood which can skyrocket prices on the blockchain (the opposite of what the miners fear).
I think the main advantage of lightning is speed, not small valued transactions. Small valued transactions can be eventually scaled by using other block extensions like tree chains / sub chains / shards, whatever you want to call them.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:00:03
It's true hashpower does matter, but so does the value of what's being hashed. I would rather own a decentralized bitcoin that solves scaling properly with lower hashpower than one based on rules that encourage centralization and a cheap hack for scaling. I think soon enough people will realize that the centralized one is no different than the current banking system, and miners will come back to where the real demand is.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:18:56
As everyone knows, bigger blocksize means more centralization. Actually, even 10 MB is too much centralization according to my calculations. But I have presented a soft-fork proposal where you effectively have bigger blocks, but each participant in the network only needs to store/validate a small number of MB of blocks. More precisely, you get effectively O( 5^n ) MB blocks on the network, while each participant only has to store/validate n-1 MB of blocks, where n is the highest "level" of chain that you are tracking. For more details see  Search my email address for more posts about it. No other proposal I know of can perform such scaling that allows for arbitrary high transaction rates while still keeping decentralisation. So far all core devs I talked to said it can work or didn't give me any fundamental flaw. Criticism is highly appreciated.

Johnson: Fake libertarian who is pro mandatory vaccines, open borders, forcing businesses to serve everyone (he agrees that a Jewish baker should be forced to bake a cake for a Nazi person). Note: Open borders could work well once we have a high level of anarchy, but before we get there we need to dismount globalism and have the national government perform basically it's only function: to protect the country from uninvited foreign intruders such as illegal aliens or foreign products.

Trump: Wants the federal government to do it's main purpose (enforce the borders), he wants a free market within the country, less taxes, audit the federal reserve, against mandatory vaccines, wants an alliance with Russia (who is against GMOs and wants to produce quality food), give more freedom to small farmers (which will strengthen the organic market and lower carbon emissions), give more freedom to states to make their own decisions (including how to manage their environment), fight against corruption (drain the swamp), fight against globalism (he will not sign TTIP), has good advisors that can connect with millenials, such as [Steven Miller](

Yes but if you want to store your lifetime of transactions (100 years) at full capacity of 1 MB blocks, that would be 5 TB, which is basically the limit for accessibility for normal people (money and space constraints).

Do you have the time complexity of producing a proof (not the space complexity) for each case?

He's very anti libertarian. He loves to interfere with other countries' issues to push his agenda. Not saying that he has bad intentions (who knows) but he clearly thinks there is a large class of people that are too stupid to know the truth, and that he knows what's best for them, and is totally against transparency of the "technology" he pushing down people's throats. After all, he did sell the anti-transparent software called Windows.

So verifying is linear in time for all 3 types of ZKPs (snarks,starks,bulletproofs)?
By proof size you mean time to create a proof, not space complexity right?
And by n I mean the complexity (circuit size) of the statement you want to prove.

I like a different analogy: You have a company you want to scale. Increasing the block size would be like making everything in the company's building larger: larger chairs, larger walls, larger meal portions. Only giants can work there now, and the products are larger, so they are more suited for giants rather than average people.
The real solution is find ways to make the products more efficiently, and keeping in mind the average user. Maybe scaling "out", like setting up new buildings, branches, new equipment...Eventually, people (or the average users) may evolve, like over hundreds of years, but we aren't going to change the dimensions until then.
In the end the product has to work well for the average users, there will be statistical variations of users, but the average users decide.

The transaction can be done in front of the person paying the cash. If the person wants, they can check the public key of the agent and see that the key actually corresponds to the node that sent the funds to the Wikileaks node. I'm not sure of the exact details, so maybe someone can explain it better.

ok that makes sense. I will think about it some more, as it may be possible that I am exaggerating and really there is no "safer" way to deploy it.
Edit: Though I think the largest worked on chain should still be respected. I know it sounds dangerous, because miners can steal coins like that using the anyone-can-spend addresses, but that's why you need to keep your payments in standard format if you want to be more safe...
@_date: 2015-09-05 22:09:50
Side chains don't have to be merge mined to be useful for scaling purposes. Actually not merge mining them is good for mining decentralization purposes.

Wouldn't you want to have bitcoins that don't trace back to you? How do you know that MtGox doesn't keep a log of what bank account corresponds to which account and which account corresponds to which bitcoins? And then when you pay someone on Silkroad, you can be traced...
I would buy bitcoins by going under disguise and meeting someone physically and giving them cash for bitcoin. Note: I don't use silk road, but I would do that just as a way to stay anonymous in general.

What we need is a bitcoin payment processor that takes bitcoins and returns dollars to the merchant and GUARANTEES that the dollars returned are exactly the same as the dollar value of the bitcoin payed. The payment processor can charge a 1% transaction fee in order for the expected gain to be positive taking into consideration the volatility of the bitcoin price during the few minutes required to perform the transaction.

I used Paxum to deposit money 2 weeks ago. It's only like a $5 fee to deposit with Certified Check or EFT. Also, you can deposit directly in Canadian dollars. Just make sure you set up your Mt Gox to create a Canadian wallet, so that you don't end up paying the commission to change from CAD to USD (that's if you have a CAD bank account).

Hi, I am posting this to the core-dev mailing list also...
What do you mean miners have to upgrade? When Seg Wit is locked in, miners mining blocks with some non segwit transactions will be blocked?
If that's the case, then this not really a soft fork. You are forcing segwit rules on the network. If in the future. we want to replace segwit with something better, we will be forced to do a hard fork. This is not a responsible way to release software!
Just make seg wit optional. What bad can happen with that?
Edit: [this]( confirms my fear. Please don't support this release. I want to keep 1 MB blocks but this is a forceful soft fork. There is a more safe way to deploy seg wit and that is what we should demand! See my mailing post from yesterday here: 
Edit 2: OK it's not as bad as I though, but still could be better. See post below.

This is the kind of business model I expected would occur soon. Talented artists can no longer rely on making money by selling copies of their works, since these copies will easily be distributed for free through the internet, but the popularity they gain from making good works gives them money through services such as this, which gives them an incentive to produce good works. It's a very efficient system, and government just needs to stop trying to enforce ancient copyright laws which just benefit the large corporate middlemen.

It's a free market, let there be millions of altcoins each with there own block size constraints, I don't care. But I will keep using the one with the 1 MB cap. And unless you wanna cause disruption, it seems like the most sensible choice. Maybe 0.95 MB is better, but might as well stick with what we have now. We can use this to build more layers to improve decentralization. Running a fork with a higher cap will degrade decentralization. If you're really so impatient and willing to risk that, then go for it, but I think it will cause major problems if many people do that. And also I am worried there are a lot of high net worth individuals (intentionally or not) that may be willing to cause that disruption.

Unless you don't care about the reputation of Bitcoin as a store of value, a hard fork should always be avoided. If Bitcoin hard forks now then it basically means that people shouldn't expect Bitcoin to be a good store of value for more than 7 years (the current age of Bitcoin). If it can easily hard fork after just 7 years, then what else would you expect?
Maybe it is just government agents, but hearing many people who welcome a hard fork is quite worrisome to me.

Also, imagine if this works. Then hostel managers will start realizing that a bitcoin exchange in their hostel is profitable, perhaps in the format of vending machines. Hostels are found all over the world (usually in dowtown cores) so then pretty much anywhere you are you would be able to easily exchange cash for bitcoin or vice versa. Liquidity of the currency would increase, and it will get people to talk about it and tell their friends.
Also, the hostels can do marketing like with brochures for places around the city that accept bitcoin. People who are coming from another country don't even have to pay the currency exchange fees then!

That's again a reason why mining decentralization is important. If you can't mine with a small anonymous operation, you will be forced to get taxed and comply with other regulations (like blocking certain transactions).

Hi, I wrote the email. I may be wrong on some things after speaking with some people, but still in general, soft forks that force new rules are dangerous in my opinion, and I am still leaning towards just going with the chain that has the most work even if segwit rules are not respected (I have to think about it).

I used to work as a graduate student at a Canadian university. They FORCE you to have a bank account. Usually if you don't have an account, they put a check in your mailbox. But they only allow you to do that during a grace period of like one month. Otherwise, you are forced to use the banking system in order to get paid. This is a simple yet unnacceptable example of crony capitalism, where you have a public institution (a University) forcing you to give money to a private institution (a bank).
