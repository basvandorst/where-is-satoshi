I wonder if anyone can help.  I held btc at the time of the b2x fork on Coinbase. How do I get access to my 1:1 matched b2x coin? Or because I don’t hold the btc private keys, can I not get the b2x ones?

Second this. It looks confusing to start with, but there are some brilliant YouTube videos explaining how to use it. Don’t waste your hard earned hodl-gains on Coinbase’s extortionate fees!

To the Maths teacher who contacted me on the site, please get in touch at support We are actually looking for a Maths teacher at the moment as part of our expansion :)

Thanks for getting in touch! You’re correct, for £120 you get three marked assessments (and very detailed feedback with follow on work on weak areas) and all the resource packs associated with the unit you choose. There are no Skype sessions included. Quiz wise, not at the moment but I like the idea and may add it in for the future.
We are currently expanding to Maths and English to offer the full core set, but we’re very strict on only employing qualified teachers and proven examiners so it’s quite hard to find people hence the slow delivery :)

I’ve just set up a new company which provides revision resources for GCSE Science students in the U.K.
We are all qualified teachers and professional examiners.
Based on current figures we are ~65% cheaper than standard face to face tutoring.
...and we accept Bitcoin :).
