What can we expect from an organization whose domain was originally intended to mean Magic The Gathering Online Xchange?

I had $.25 left so I set a GTC buy for 1 BTC @ $.25.  Always thought it was a joke.  Now - who knows?

This one has been overclocked and run continuously for what, months?  It's a long way toward being used up.  I wouldn't give $100 for it.

The [bitcoin profit calculator]( has been negative since last summer.  It surprises me that anyone is still willing to try.

Those bid/ask spreads are insane.

Why doesn't the bitcoin client strongly encourage all users to insert a USB stick or some other storage for providing an encrypted offline wallet?

On windows you could use [Faronics DeepFreeze](  As its name suggests, it freezes your PC in a given state.  Although you can write to the hard drive, once your system reboots, it reverts back to whatever state you froze it in.  So any trojan or virus will vanish with a reboot.  To install new software or persistent data, you have to reboot into an unfrozen state, install, then reboot frozen again.  
Buddy of mine had DeepFreeze on all the PCs in his cyber cafe.  He gave all the users admin access and they could (and would) download all the virus-laden crap or install whatever software they wanted.  But after their time was up, he'd reboot and everything would go back to normal.

Those are pretty long for conversational speech.  I'd prefer monosyllabic words so you can say "hey, I'll give you 20 mics for that", which to me sounds more casual than "hey, I'll give you 20 micro-bitcoins for that".

The smallest increment you can generally pay someone in USD is $.01.  The smallest increment in Bitcoin is 0.00000001 BTC.  Small distinction, but it can potentially enable true microtransactions.  So, instead of paying a flat $20/month to access a name-brand news portal, you might pay 0.00001 BTC per article you access.  Similarly, instead of contributing your lucid writing to Wikipedia, you might choose to write for an information outlet that pays you 0.00000023 BTC everytime someone reads your stuff.

The volatility of BTC has meant that sellers 'actual' price is pegged to a stable currency like USD.  As I understand it, most sellers ask you to contact them the moment you're ready to buy, and they adjust their BTC price to match their actual USD price.  The seller undoubtedly flips the BTC on a currency market the moment it verifies.  (Unless they're also speculating in BTC, which some sellers probably are).
It wouldn't surprise me if seller's websites start automating the adjustment of their BTC price to whatever the current Mt. Gox USD price is, plus a small risk premium.

This reveals one of the strengths of BitCoin.  The US government has racked up around $250,000 per taxpayer in the top half of income (these are the folks who pay 97% of the tax burden).  Now, to clear that debt, each taxpayer can either fork over their share, or the government can simply steal it from debt instrument holders, such as mortgage holders, by making the cash they're owed for a physical asset worth less.
Since no one can simply print more BitCoins, this avenue of theft by government is closed down.  If a national economy were denominated in BitCoin, debts would have to be repaid in fixed currency.  On the other hand, maybe the average taxpayer would prefer to have their underwater mortgage inflated out of its hole and would happily let the debt-instrument holders get the shaft.  In which case, this reveals a weakness of BitCoin.
