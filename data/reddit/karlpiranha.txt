seems its get used by smaller and smaller deviations though
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:00:35
i am also new and read abt it - seems there is a huge backlog on open transaction causing this. when the transaction fee (set by the wallet) is low it may take days.
(i find that strange as i always heard "instantly around the globe" as one of the pros of the system)
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:20:43
is there a way to see/proof that? a lost wallet is indiatinguishable from a unused wallet, right?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:47:25
thanks for encouragement for welcoming know-nothings like me ;)
i got my knowledge from side-eyeing headlines for years, listening to joe rogan podcasts, biting my ass from not buying at 400usd (due to some entry barriers to the portal [read: not following trough]) - and over the last days buing my first humble stock of btc/eth/ltc.
i already asked dumb questions here and feel happy that partly i will be forgiven ;)

just started to relisten - first appearance is 27th January 2014 -  (today  came out).
interesting. and i feel blind for having been dormant.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:37:48
same boat - bought few days ago ;)
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:36:50
i see 2 confirmations - refresh 3...
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:56:42
yes - I find both sides of stories amusing to read - the guy who payed 10k btc for pizzas and the guy who found back lots of btc from a time where they were basically at the value of monopoly money.
got the comment about not referring to buying btc as "stocks" - guess i meant "stacks" rather (non-native english speaker here).
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:56:06
i wanted to buy a few when they were at 400usd. didnt because exchange registration issues.
now that hurts.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:12:12
interesting, thanks.
they (btc/eth/ltc wallet addresses) seem to stay same though - also not showing a button to refresh.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:49:43
why should miners do my job? are they even qualified?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:11:19
especially since speed and cheap tx costs seem to be part of what should make bitcoin superior ofer fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:36:18
that clarifies my question as well, have a tx in limbo since 16h.
thanks for that!
as btc greenhorn, i have to say i am really puzzled by this happening.
- how can it be that tx speed is one of the things highlighted to be so great about btc?
- wouldnt further adoption (hoped for and needed) makes this worse down the line?
- if a tx expires - does it mean the btc returns or is lost - if the latter, this can hardly be considered a safe solution to exchange value, right?
experiencing this within my first 10 transactions really somewhat lowers my enthusiasm (guess thats what u get entering at this point in time - so i'll leave my chips on the table ;) )
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:18:48
yes - its a blast. as ignorant as I was/am, joe and redban ask some pretty dumb things. 
going to listen to the other 2 appearances afterwards as well. 
nice - even if there is a little "salt in the wound" component to it, given my painful idling ;)
*&lt;damn, when i see those poste where people show a pich of buying 35BTC for 1000USD... and they were not even the early ones....&gt;*
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:34:51
i am at 0.17 - but also want to have 1 (damn buying limits). 
its just a number - but it makes following the news about it more fun :)
i'll buy one quickest possible, and then start small regular investments in btc and others cryptos
@_date: 2019-04-24 00:42:01
nah - sounds about right!
@_date: 2019-04-18 09:13:00
looks like you are about to put a log on the engine cover.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:36:36
will people never learn? ;)
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:44:46
its a matter of time mostly. china takes more and more influence in china.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:58:10
good move
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:51:22
wake up and face reality
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:05:49
yeap - new to crypto but thats what ive been doing up till now - first and last 3.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:33:00
pretty much the reason people set hopes in btc is due to not having to rely in things likenpaypal in the future ;)
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:22:07
one btc is worth more! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:22:55
so - where should i buy to make use (potentially) of bbc?
