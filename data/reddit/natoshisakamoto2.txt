Or do you just have trouble with pronouns? 
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:57:19
No, I think the amount they were discussing was 2 cents per tx if I recall.
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:22:51
Okay, so you have zero idea what you are talking about, I can assure you 100% of that. I was aware of the  discussions with the coder for the LN and the companies involved. The fee on the LN is 6 cents, 2 cents of that goes to the companies who sent the txs over to the LN from the locked nodes.
 If you doubt me, some employees of those companies post here, as does the coder for the LN, ask them before you go shooting off your mouth at me when you are wrong.

If you are a merchant, you may want to accept bitcoin as a payment method, which by the protocol won't allow that to happen instantly. Now if there was a company for instance a wallet provider service, they know an individual's coin situation and can guarantee to a merchant if the coins are sent they will get to the merchant. IOW, payment processing in bitcoin can be handled by a company to company, rather than an individual scammer type
BitGo Instant service has exceeded 19,000 transactions per week, for an average weekly transaction amount exceeding 10,000 Bitcoins, equivalent to $7M USD. BitGo Instant allows on-chain, zero confirm, instant transactions between participants

Judge Wimes ruled that the FTC was unlikely to succeed in their arguments. (Docket 201 Case No. 4:14­CV­00815­BCW).
“All the equipment has to be tested, [which] made our return rate less than 5 percent, which is great,” said Ownby. “Any piece of electronic equipment that goes out the door is tested before it’s shipped, and that’s all we were doing. Burn testing typically took less than two hours and in rare cases as much as two days, if necessary
[interjection by me: if you discover a faulty component, you need to fix it and continue the testing]
The company went on to say that this was the smallest machine the company made and was given to Drake, as well as other customer service agents so they could become familiar with them, after the completed delivery of the 65-nm line of equipment as they were unshippable due to the fact that they were under performing. Butterfly Labs said that employees received these machines as gifts to understand how they worked.
“She only mined a total of four bitcoins as at the time it was easier to mine,” Ownby said. “I have no idea why they came up with that amount, but she settled to get them out of our business, so we can try to fix this mess.”
The settlement of $15,000 and $4,000 were agreed upon by both sides so that Butterfly Labs could end the case.
“The company, with the FTC action, was decimated. This settlement was done to avoid any further legal action and to try and preserve any assets we had left,” said Ownby. “We agreed to that settlement only because we didn’t want to deal with this anymore. We were trying to look to the future, so that’s why we agreed to it.”
“We had a massage person come in every two weeks for the employees as an employee benefit,” said Ownby. “It’s these kind of things that get overblown that we kept getting hammered with, and it was ludicrous.”

In a nutshell, you use a cryptographic elliptical curve function that has a property that if you hold the private key you can present a signature of data with a public key that proves you hold the private key. 
The data in this instance is a message that tells the transaction processors to update the ledger known as the blockchain, by moving amounts from one hash ledger entry to another. It uses also ripemd 160 and sha 256 to verify this.
This is only an intro to the idea in a nutshell.

If there are larger blocks, then a confirmation would take on average around 5 minutes. Now you may not understand this. See, txs come in around the clock, typically it would be 5 minutes to get a confirmation then. Now, you dont seem interested in instant confirmations companies, maybe you dont want your customers info given to those.

The issue about the above is known as liquidity. But that is not the issue I need to address here about this, it is foundational concepts in bitcoin. If you look at bitcoin in general as shares of a company for this example only, the more money coming in to the limited amount of shares gives it its traction in value. The more people that come in with their money gives more value per share.

A group of gangsters are about to pull off a
big Job. The plan of action is prepared down to
the last detail~ Some of the men are holed up in a
warehouse across town, awaiting precise instructions.
It is absolutely essential that the two
groups act with complete reliance on each other in
executing the plan. 
Of course, they will never get around to putting
the plan into action, because the following
sequence of events is bound to take place.
i. A messenger is dispatched across town,
with instructions from the boss.
2. The messenger reaches his destination.
At this point both parties know the plan
of action. But the boss doesn't know
that his message got through (muggings
are a common occurrence). So the messenger
is sent back, to confirm the message.
3. The messenger reaches the boss safely.
Now, everybody knows the message got
through. Of course, the men in the
warehouse are not aware that step 3
occurred, and must he reassured. Off
goes the messenger.
4. Now the men in the warehouse too know
that step 3 was successful, but unless
they communicate their awareness...

I first heard the word 'bitcoin' in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the FreeTalkLive.com podcast.
It sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, "This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn't worth anything."
I moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research...
In February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around $0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture.
I realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days.
There was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox.
I contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site's owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn't yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York.
I waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox... and the price of bitcoin rose... and then it rose some more...
Several days went by, but Gox still hadn't credited my wire transfer.
I began to grow impatient... The price was rising ever closer to $1.
As the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited... but I wasn't deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well – and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin.
One of them was less than convinced.
When I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, "If you think bitcoins are so great, why don't you buy more of them?"
As soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox.
Somewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1...
As anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem.
I couldn't help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better.
I would literally tell anyone who would listen.
From strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!)
I paid for the world's first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became.
I knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea.
But, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time.
I still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies.
They were all wrong, and I gladly told them so.
Today, many people still dismiss bitcoin.  But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.

So a blocksize increase that is not segwit is acceptable to you?
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:47:19


So you agree those exist, so you were mistaken to label me the way you did. So will you retract your dishonest namecalling and insulting of me, those were wholly inappropriate, given your admissions. Those haven't been solved, so for now, those ideas need to be shelved, so we can solve the viable issue that now exists.

When I first looked at the bitcoin protocol design in early 2014, I thought about it for a few hours and realized an inherent flaw in it;
I looked it up, and someone exploited it earlier, and they had to rewrite the blockchain because of that.
I have classic software myself, and they in the past had a shitload of nodes, for some reason it didn't pan out. Now I know in here you need to keep a low profile, but if you want the govt's influence to be diminished from the project, you have to first fork out the devs colluding with the govt. If all the info you get is only from this sub with this nym, you will not see the whole picture.

Not really.

If that were so, he would have a huge hashrate %.
Turns out, he has about 2% or so.
That means a miner has to burn a lot of work for nothing.
Looks like they are not doing too well.


Yeah, get that two percent.

I am sure someone serious would draw it out, then psuedocode it, then fill in whatever language to do it. Since we already have the code, that simplifies it. Me reviewing wouldn't count for much around here, as they don't think completely at this point my reviews carry much weight yet, and would take some time, but if someone wants my review if they paid me I would, I don't find this pertinent at this point myself.

I wonder if the following is valid:
If segwit is only 30% of the hashrate, and someone submits a segwit tx, and if there is a backlog of segwit txs, how long would it take to get in the blockchain as confirmed?

If you notice, I am not in crypto news nor mentioned in stories on social forums, unless you somehow think I am, do you?
Now if you go back and look, someone said that secret discussion was taking place, among certain people involved, instead of denying such was occurring, someone who would know, they merely said, they didn't attend such or were involved in it.
IOW, instead of saying it wasn't happening, he said 'it isn't me'.

@_date: 2017-04-02 18:25:18
That is what you outlined: here is mine.
The govt watched those places with all their abilities to do so. There is a rogue govt agent who is emotional. All this talk about the daily and weekly hashrate pushed him over the edge, and he just had to do something. Hopefully, the FBI will investigate this theft, as that is what this actually is. Someone burglarized 10 homes, and put all the loot into someone elses house. When the FBI fnds out which rogue agent it is, they put their foot down, as this is the line he crossed which is too far, and cuff his stupid ass for it.

How else are they going to guarantee someone else wont move the coins on them if they go over to the LN?
What is blockstream in business for?
We have a company here, you can trust we can lock them in here on the main chain for you so you can transact on the LN, if not no one will trust you over there not to move the coins on them.
But you do not have to worry about the LN, as we will never get to it, it is just something they are selling to people, to get them to go along with the preceding issue that lets them go to the fabled LN, it is just smoke the govt is blowing up the ass of blockstream.
