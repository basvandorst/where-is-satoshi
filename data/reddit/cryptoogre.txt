I would argue Tether hurts bitcoin more than it helps, 
I am inclined to believet that Tether has been behind the massive run up in shitcoins. Most shitcoins are traded on exchanges that do not handle incoming USD.  The ability to cash out BTC and maintain a stable USDT balance, has allowed the massive shitcoin pump that we have witnessed.  Previously your only stable options was to move the money back to BTC or USD at a homebase exchange.
Notice how Bitcoin dominance has collapsed over the last few months
I don't know if Tether is not backed, but Tether has enabled liquid movement of capital over the last few months, that allowed people to speculate in things that would have been much harder and costly to do without Tether.

No courage is tell this poor schmuck, not to buy lotto tickets.  Buying bitcoin after 1,500% gain in 12 months, with no pullback is just that.
Cowardice is to lay your head on your pillow at night knowing that extra $.50 in the price of BTC today, is because someone in poverty wants a way out and you told him atta boy by bitcoin and all your dreams will come true.

Yeah that actually Ricardos labor theory of value which is completely discredited.  Not at all how economic decisions are made.
Bitcoin is not a currency, its a system. It allows decentralized value transfer and coordination between un-trusted parties.  That mechanism alone if it continues to operate is probably worth 10% of future global financial system, call it around 120 trillion 20 years out, so around 10-12 trillion bitcoin should anchro about 35% of that maybe 4 trillion
Finance Industry is 7.3% drag on GDP in the USA. To be replaced by Future decentralized systems and AI.
Government is another 36% drag again in the US, if you view at simply a mechanism for insuring coordination of value transfer between un-trusted parties.  Take another 10% of that, and a more efficient Economy.
Legal services about 2% drag, again, smart contracts, AI, deregulation since you cant regulate what you don't know, cant control, or have no power over.

Chamath has been right about every major trend in the last 10 years, and has directly participated in them as a builder, owner and VC.
Warren, Charlie and Bill Gates built their billions in the last 40 years by RENT SEEKING.
If anyone provides no value its them. Bill Gates billions are legacy of the monoply he built in MSDOS/Windows over 30 years ago.
Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger have been very shrewd in buying already great companies, they are  not mangers, operations guru, software developers or engineers. They are merely market makers.
They  are not qualified to discuss new technology, when they have missed out in the last  4 decades of innovation.
What we are witnessing and we are all involved whether we want to or not is what Ray Kurzweill has referred to as the singularity.  Bitcoin is being discussed on CNBC daily, when it was a joke just 24 months ago. No one in the current system knows what to do.  And Bitcoin/Crypto is only one subset of the massive change that is occurring, so rapidly we will have no ability to even measure it.  How few people can even comprehend the actual mechanism of Nakamoto-Consensus and  cryptography.
Once GAI comes online and its happening, what will come out on the other side will be another humanity.  That will truly exploit the power that decentralized systems like bitcoin offer.

Intel ME requires it to be activated at boot on the BIOS, its not some hidden system checking in with INTEL.
This is not unlike Lights out management that is standard in every enterprise server.  I have read of some fringe case exploits but before they start hacking your bitcoins, you would have full control of most enterprise servers.
Its a management tool to simplify administration of PCs in enterprise environment.
Intel ME does not introduce any other risk to your PC that isn't already there If someone has physical access to your PC and you did not handle proper security, encryption of drive, not storing unencrypted keys, or your passwords, then you should be ok.

Flat tax is a pipe dream, because it would mean a huge tax increase for almost 50% of the population in the U.S who pay less 10% in Federal income tax, while those in the 33% tax bracket would be getting tax cuts.  
The Tax code is an embedded monstrosity of the modern state and will go away the day the state does.
The reality is that media tax bracket for Federal Income tax is around 15%.  I hate taxes, but the tax burden in the U.S is not unreasonable and my thoughts its actually pretty well used, there is bloat in government but the biggest consumer of Federal Spending are entitlements and Defense. 
If anything reducing Corporate Tax rates, elimination of double taxation of Dividend Income, eliminate Carried Interest loophole, and provide  a tax free return of of foreign cash are the most important thing I feel to reform, and would have huge immediate impacts.

This is not the case however, money is always taxed at the source.  People who have a zillion dollars paid taxes when they received it or earned it, the problem is several
1. Many High Net worth individuals have their networth tied up in illiquid untaxable ivestments, such as stock options or stock, or investment vehicles.
They are paper rich
Until the stock is cashed it is not taxed.  Trying to tax something that has not generated income can causes a lot of problems.  Do you tax someone who made paper gains?  What if the price collapses the next day, it would have applications far and wide for everyone including people of lower means. Do you want to pay taxes on the Bitcoin you hold, even though you haven't sold it.
2. Paper rich can buy you a lot, because many people will pledge collertaral or get access to capital via their networth allowing to grow their networth in tax deferred ways. Something people who are primarily income based can  not do.
3. These individuals have the best tax advisors which allow them to create many ways to defer taxes. However it does not mean they don't pay taxes
The biggest problem right now is 
1. The tax bite for someone make $150K is way more painful to them, than someone who makes $1,500,000 or 10,500,000
Its just a factor of large numbers and wealth.
2. The only way to make the pain the same, is to raise the income tax to a level that is punitive and somewhat unfair. Are we going to rasies taxes to 50%, 65% even 90%?  And set an annual income limit?
What is the government going to do with this income?
3. Or you lower income tax for people to feel less pain. 
4. We are fast approaching the point of no return in 1st world socieites where the number of people who pay into the tax system equals or less than number of people who take out.  This is unsustainable.
The reality is tax rates across the board need to go up, and benefits need to go down.  Which is why I am buying bitcoin because the system is fed.

You cannot deliver any type of communication service to consumers without dealing with enormous amounts of government regulation.
This is why last mile is owned.  The minute you resell services its a huge problem, at local, state and federal.
In the 1990s ISP where a dime a dozen, and started out of garages because they were de-regulated entities, or at least they where in a grey zone piggy backing on existing copper.
Then the market matured, .com bubble popped and more services, where needed keep in a shit ton of dark fiber was built out in the late 90's/00 because of over investing, which was actually a god send for 05-10 boom.
Mom and Pop ISP,  where consolidated and attacked by last mile LECs, who used market practices and regulatory capture to put them out of business. The larger ones got bought out.
However again, heavy hand of goverment via Obama keeps meddling in telecom.
The only way to get more services, is to deregulate the whole thing, and allow all type of last mile providers to flourish.
Educate yourself.
If Comcast started charging premium fees for netflix, guess what there would be a million market solutions to bypass them overnight.  People would seek out other providers, even at premium.   This would benefit mom and pop Wisps

Bitcoin is fixed supply it will never be " stable",
stability does not exist, what people perceive as stability is the combination of unit of accounting, and  cost shifting to create the perception of stability.
People really mean volatility. Bitcoin will always be volatile is some respect because it is a fixed supply, so only price can shift and it will probably never be a unit of account in a G 20 country.
Volatility will decline as market cap increases as it already has.  But it will always be subject to Black swan price dislocations in some form. Even if Bitcoin market is 5 trillion it just means that there will be holders who can move 500 billion in a day.

This is a real issue that Bitcoin has no solution for at the moment. 
People scoffed at regulators but they are already clamping down on fiat flows and ICOs. Regulators have yet to attack bitcoin fungibility.
However Bitcoin currently allows for very detailed chain analysis enabling this reality of seizing or blocking funds.
A US dollar handed to you in a mall for a coffee even by the Head of Cartel is 100% fungible, and will more than likely never be clawed back.
However 1 Bitcoin received on Open Bazaar can be flagged, and all prior transactions. This becomes a hot potato, exchanges won't touch it, less they incurr a visit from the Feds. It doesn't matter what jurisdiction you are in the G20 operates the same around the world at this point.  They all have an incentive in turning Bitcoin into a hammer against freedom or crippling it.
Even attempting to tumble through monero, is only passing the buck to the monero exchange, who will probably not accept the transaction, because now they are stuck with unfungible bitcoin.
Thats why we need things like mimblewimble, ring signatures, and more privacy in bitcoin.

The valuation comparisons are as pointless as claiming I am establishing on Short position on Apple in 1983, because they decided to build their OS in house and they will never succeed, while IBM outsourced that to Microsoft so they can focus on building great hardware.
Ethereum and Bitcoin are in such early stages of development its ridiculous to argue from any point of survive-ship or precedence.  Many of the attacks on Ethereum can be used against Bitcoin, they are just more expensive for now.  
This is just another bitcoin maximilism post, masquearding as investment thesis, which is the complete anti-thesis of being a shrewd investor.  Bitcoin-maximilism is religious zealotry and not grounded in anything remotely approximating scientific or unbiased economic modeling.  
If you told me there was a critical flaw in Ethereum that is one thing, but so far your entire proposition is that Ethereum is not bitcoin ergo it must fail. Umm no shit, ethereum was purposely built to explore everything Bitcoin is not, and see what the market potential is. Given the level of support and development that Ethereum has garnered in the last few months its impressive. The fact the development team has responded to each attack is emboldening, and reinforces that Ethereum is not some joke premine, but a serious endeavor to establish a viable smart contract network.   
That so many reasonable bitcoiners have become become infected with ethereum derangement syndrome lately makes me wonder, what is it that they fear so much?
