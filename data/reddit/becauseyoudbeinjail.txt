Lol, a blocksize increase is not force. You are more than free to keep mining 1MB blocks 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:07:47
I just made a post asking about this: 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:11:38
SegWit has a similar function but doesn’t actually increase the block. As you can see bitcoin fees are retarded with it

I️ don’t see any manipulation. All they did was list a coin and freeze the order book. Freezing the order book protected consumers because there wasn’t enough liquidity.  Granted, that was a mistake. But it was not “manipulation.”

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:56
Right everyone who disagrees with you is a shill. Or you could admit that increasing the blocksize would alleviate the absurd fees Bitcoin has today

What on earth....doubling the blocksize allows more transactions in each block thus decreasing the fees. The miners that handle 1MB blocks can handle 2MB blocks. Nothing you’re saying is correct

The price of bitcoin doesn't affect my analysis. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:19:32

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:03
Coinbase didn’t “pre-announce” Litecoin. They just listed it. Same way it happened here. 
The price was at 8k because the order book was so thin that merely ~1.1k BCH coins were traded on GDAX and pumped the price to 9k. Seeing this lack of liquidity, GDAX froze trades which froze the last “price” at 9.5k. It was never actually being meaningfully traded at 9.5k or remotely close to that. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:00:11
Honestly no idea what you’re  talking about. Frankly both sides have similar agreement on an eventual second later network. Major disagreement is on the size of the base settlement layer and whether you want to fractionally reserve that second layer.

Nothing is dying or living. Users voluntarily choose which chain to use.
Store of value is a meme that Core is forced to fall back on since bitcoin isn’t viable as a common currency anymore. No shit that is a use case. It is a use case for any currency.  The point is to do both.
And the censorship is nuts, everyone knows that 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:45:07


Well to them its not misinformed and not illegitimate. You dont have to agree with those opinions,  but its obviously safe to say that people who wanted Bitcoin to scale on-chain found *that specific* protocol implementation in bcash
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:16:35


That subreddit was the on-chain side of the debate with people who already believed Bitcoin could scale but couldnt debate it in r/Bitcoin. It’s just the other side of the debate that had been raging on for years before the 2017 fork. 
Its mostly libertarian/AnCaps, and my understanding is that the subreddit was only created because of the prohibition on debating certain ideas on r/Bitcoin years ago.
I’m not sure what was actually being censored back then, but I guess people thought there was enough that warranted another subreddit (remember, this is all before bcash ever existed). It wasn’t like people saw Bitcoin’s rise in 2017 and thought “oh I can trick people by making a subreddit with the ticker”
The other subreddit had always been about Bitcoin scaling, so if you don’t have the historical context behind why it exists then it wont make sense.
Everyone who advocated for on-chain Bitcoin scaling has found that implementation in Bcash, so its no surprise what goes on in there.

Yes long term I have no concern at all. But I think these are going to be rough next few weeks. Imagine if Kraken/Poloniex said you can't withrdraw. That shakes confidence even if its unwarranted.

At scale it’s prohibitively expensive to transact on chain. There’s no gun to your head of course but there’s a de facto requirement to use it (assuming you are staying with Bitcoin instead of an alt)

@_date: 2016-11-10 16:49:36
Yeah I agree man. I come back here every few months and feel the exact same way. People making assertions or calling someone a clueless idiot for even considering a certain opinion.
I'm sure if I knew more about this I could find myself on one side of it, but every time I come here I can't even get through the propaganda to begin to understand what the paradigm actually is.
Edit: If someone wants to correct my rudimentary understanding, it sounds like there is an upper limit on the amount of transactions that bitcoin can process (per second/per block?) meaning that if it were to ever hope to be big, you wouldn't be able walk over to starbucks and swipe a quick BTC Card because it could take hours to process.  Therefore there needs to be some change, but it sounds like changing anything at this point goes against the decentralized spirit of bitcoin, and that opponents of the change think it gives a core group too much power?
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:55:01
Can you ELI5 this issue please?
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:43:38


I legit burst out laughing
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:03:34
No I really want to understand it. Correct me where I'm wrong:
The more transactions per second, the slower those transactions will be because there is a hard limit on how many new data points can be inserted into each new block, which is mined over X amount of time.
My understanding of the problem is that eventually, you won't be able to go to a Starbucks and have the transaction process instantly because of the backlog to fit into the next block. 
This means in its current iteration it can never be widely used the way current fiat is used for transactions.
Anything I'm missing?

It’s tribalistic and partisan when people actually try to demagogue all of Gab as “Nazis”. Something like Stormfront is an *actual* Nazi website with the express goal of generally bigoted shit. Gab is just Twitter without censorship.
 If you like painting Gab with a broad Nazi stoke, you’re gonna love when the government cracks down on Bitcoin users as a bunch of shady darknet users. It’s crazy to see comments in this subreddit. Years ago you would have never seen people on a Bitcoin, a censorship free currency, attack something like Gab for refusing to censor.

Hey, I got the bitcoin one working but I cant get another one working for ChainLink. Here is what I got


	set result to fetch JSON from "
	set price to price_usd of item 1 of result as number
end tell


return result_string
I'd like to change price_usd to price_btc but I dont think that works. I'd also like for there to be a ₿ symbol instead of a dollar symbol. I made both of these changes and the new widget shows up for a half second and then disappears. Actually, even if I try it without any changes it disappears immediately. Any tips?
Edit: Never coded in my life but between some googling I was able to get this to work:


	set result to fetch JSON from "
	set price to price_usd of item 1 of result as number
end tell


return result_string
I'd really lke to get it showing in terms of Bitcoin but I wasnt able to yet
EDIT 2: 
I think I got it?


	set result to fetch JSON from "
	set price to price_btc of item 1 of result as number
end tell


return result_string

He’s been saying that for a while. If the settlement later blocks are larger then that’s true because the cost to open channels on chain is cheaper. Idk any of the technicals over weather it works without segwit 
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:04:54
The data doesn’t corroborate your opinion — by far the most influential cause of lower fees has clearly been from less usage rather than batching or SegWit. 


Well you being wrong was the whole proposition, at least we’re on the same page.


You’re going to be so disappointed. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:16:41
Just using your definition man
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:40:13
The fact that you'd rather discuss mainnet metrics rather than LN's lack of proliferation is illuminating. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:54:56
Roger isn’t actually opposed to the LN in a vacuum, right? My understanding is that he’s fine with the LN but just wanted bigger blocks in addition rather than remaining at 1MB+ w/e Segwit added
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:17:01
Yeah, and that’s cheaper when the on chain transaction is cheaper like I said

Let me ask you this: ignore the pie in the sky future of what may or may not happen to Moore’s law “one day”
Has Moore’s law done enough so far to make 32MB blocks possible?  I never understood why we couldnt have just done both


Then why not decrease the size of the blocks?
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:11:37
If we were gonna go that big eventually anyway wish we had just gone ahead and done it to prevent all these factions

Why do people say that running ones own full node with zero hashing power do nothing to secure the network?
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:12:42
The most effective way to censor an opinion is to censor the opinion 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:57:58
Exactly, it’s really more of a science experiment right now and throttling adoption because of it 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:28:53
Woah, are you sure about that second part?
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:25:39
I see it analogous to body cameras on police. Will people always hate police no matter what they do and always assume the worst? Sure. But  now arguments contain objective evidence. Just because you can’t make everyone happy doesn’t mean transparency should be rejected as a goal to strive for. 


I’d love to read more about the history on this. Wouldnt it be as easy as checking a box on the subreddit settings?
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:18:22
How about just make the mod logs public? Still allows curation and shuts people up about "unfair" censorship. Peopel will complain no matter what, but at least people can make up their own minds with evidence. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:13:24
That tends to occur more for individuals than general ideas ie trying to hide a certain picture vs purging dissent
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:37:17
Because of the genuinely held belief that it is the actual brand
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:24:14
Right but I assume the reference is to a blocksize increase with a hardfork beyond what segwit does and in that case the blocks should have just been increased now 
Doesn’t matter anymore obviously, just ironic that the small block side of this debate already conceded the blocks needed to be bigger eventually. Could have just done when it was needed lmao
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:29:23
Reduced main net fees are the result of less people using Bitcoin, and even if 5c transactions are possible the average fee is actually far, far above that anyway.  
Really thought the subject of our conversation had nothing to do whether or not LN would be “working.” 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:28:10
You still have to open and close channels eventually don’t you? To load them?
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:12:25


What are those terms though? How are you setting terms if you dont enforce any terms (don’t censor)

He would control people by no longer controlling what they say? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:49:23

@_date: 2018-04-12 23:51:22
Ah, well in that case it is NOT yet fun then and is extremely far from it 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:57:28
That total quantity means hardly anything without context over how long you’ve run it. 
I also don’t understand this debate over whether or not running a full node actually does anything to secure the network. My understanding is that it’s useful for merchants to validate payments, but useless in “securing” the network because it has no hashing power? But that running your own node would also let you “know” if a mining attack happened? But without hashing power you can’t actually do anything about it right? Sorry for so many questions lol
