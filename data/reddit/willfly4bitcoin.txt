It took me a week to figure how to do this using an Asus laptop and Windows 8 with a live cd. Still wasn't able to print a paper wallet with the 2 printers I have. Frustrating stuff.

I signed up for your service a few months back but haven't utilized it yet. I will test it out soon. I'm thinking a power washer maybe.

While I do endorse the Mycelium trader app, it was rather frustrating waiting 31 minutes for it to confirm. This was my first and only time selling some coin. Hopefully this isn't the norm.

A blonde went to a flight school insisting that she wanted to learn to fly. As all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her by radio on how to pilot the solo helicopter. He took her out, showed her how to start it and gave her the basics, and sent her on her way.
After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. "I'm doing great! I love it! The view is so beautiful, and I'm starting to get the hang of this."
After 2000 feet, she radioed again, saying how easy it was to fly. The instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she hadn't radioed in.
A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile away. He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage.
When he asked what happened, she said, "I don't know! Everything was going fine, but as I got higher, I was starting to get cold. I can barely remember anything after I turned off the big fan!"

I've been using them for 8 months and the site has always been like that. Just navigating their site is very annoying as the pages do take forever to load if they even do before I close it out

Why? Because the million of other threads exactly like this one wasn't good enough for you?

I had 2 printers that wouldn't work with my ubuntu live cd when trying to print paper wallets so I just went to the pawn shop and bought a used HP printer for $20. It worked perfectly.

I personally don't have any experience with them. I only spent maybe 10 minutes looking them up.
