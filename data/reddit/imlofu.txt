What you are doing so "smartly" xd Claiming to be from South Korea when all the South Koreans claim that it was a bad translation in the first place :D (so that means you are just trying to claim you are south korean while in reality you are from anywhere but that) So the only left option is for you to be anti-crypto FUDer who is butthurt about not jumpimg on the profit train :)

Probably coinbase put a fee on it, by my estimations from how trash they are it should be around... 100%? Mistake me if I'm wrong of course, sorry for the experience using that bcash bastion~

You need to actually understand how it works buddy~

I meant that completely ALL coins are going to shi-tter right now, not only the BTC, besides yet again I'm not fearful about it at all I just see it as a part of experience, tho rip the people who got in at 18k-19k
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:21:56
This, it could mean a jump in price, especially taken how its mostly oil money

After 17th*** CME's date changed
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:54:23
Why so?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:04
A very false statement :P

It is actually scary holy fluff, just how easily everything was pumped into, now that easily everything is just dropping outright, EVERYTHING is in red, this is truly a day to remember for cryptocurrencies I'm sure, but I still believe!
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:36:23
Count me in on that, I really thought Roger would try to dump btc and pump bch when the diff change was approaching with whole 17%, but opposite happened
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:59
A price dip to the medium-ish line after a huge bull (upwards) move, which we saw just earlier this month, it was really optimistic for moat of people that btc would reach 10k jist couple weeks ago, now it was bloating around 20k, which didnt represent the real proce of btc, after correction it comesback to the medium-ish line and then usually bulls upwards again :) Hope I didnt make any mistakes explaining it, Im sure someone will fix me if I did!

Thanks for the help yet again! I really do appreciate it a lot :)!

Yush I really couldn't have asked for more, it's really nice that the community is welcome of newbies, cause I guess everyone profits from that haha, but still I really appreciate you spilling it out for me step by step, it's really helpful and clear! I'm sorry if I sounded inpolite in any way possible cause of wrong use of english sentence structure (I'm sure everyone is already fed up with hearing that, tho just to make sure I repeat it as well ^w^) 
Either way following the trends over Kraken analytics I have managed to swap into BCH just before it jumped up right now so I really confident, feels like I just discovered a new hobby haha..
I owe you a favor, so if you ever need anything I can help with over the net, make sure to send me a PM!
Thanks again~

Oh, thank you for the kind answer! May I ask how do you know when are the difficulty adjustments coming up? I'm still rather new to all of this..! My kind regards~
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:42:09
Oh right, I do play it indeed, and surely we could play the game together!
I'm not sure how the reddit works yet either, so not sure if I can find your IGN there, but you could add me up (IGN: StrayFoxyLFDaddy) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:57:38
Hmph, what's wrong with kraken exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:46:22
I actually do.. &gt;w&lt; Just didn't want to bother anymore, as I'm pretty sure if I researched it myself i could find it myself, but just logically, how do the difficulty changes affect BTC value?
I'm assuming that easier difficulties makes the transaction time faster and then lower fee transactions doesn't get stuck, so it increases the value? While harder difficulty does the opposite?

My english isn't the best so sorry, but - you can't just sell all 5000 btc for the same price, unless there is a HUGE floor of buy orders, the market depth usually goes (just an example) like this:
1. 0.9 BTC for 7999
2. 0.5 BTC for 7998
150. 27 BTC for 5032
So your not all of your 5000 btc would sell for 7999, it would be sold for 5032 as well, which means you wouldn't really be making anything
