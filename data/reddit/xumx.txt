It generates the challenge in parallel. But needs to be solved in serial. Spinning up more machines will not solve it any faster.

I don't think you are wrong. But when shit goes down, bitcoin is the only established alternative system that people can move to. 
So the question is. Will there be a major financial/currency crisis? (hint: there will be)

That's stupid. It means the author pays out 12.5k now (assuming 250/coin), and gets $10k value if he wins the wager. ($100x100)
Lose-lose situation. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:25:08
No. You got that logic flipped upside down. 
Untrustworthy means. Even if he wins. He can't claim the winning. 
So he doesn't join a one sided bet. 
Even if he thinks he won't lose, there is no benefit in playing a one sided game.

Good timing.

So.. Essentially.
Private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address 
But you can't reverse it. Is that correct?

How much have you accumulated so far
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:59:24
The author can transfer money between two of his own wallets and achieve the same effect with no cost right? Other than transaction fees. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:57:15
You wouldn't know how to make a copy. 
And you don't have the private key so you can't spend the money from that wallet. 
The coin forms a closed loop linked to the verified account.

It's funny how it drops $10 right when you finish writing this post. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 17:52:44
Yeah. So far, blockchain -&gt; abe -&gt; MySQL -&gt; data mining tools  seems to be the only viable way. 
I was just wondering if someone has already done the parsing and is hosting the files for public download.

I think this might be our guy. Mr Satoshi Nakamoto. By declaring bitcoin as the national currency, he has an advantage similar to seigniorage.
