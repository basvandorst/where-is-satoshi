Check out his Wiki page. It reads like a police rap sheet.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:47:47
You do realize that pretty much every business he has ever been involved with ends with him getting arrested or fleeing a country, right?
He is a smart guy, but he is also a career criminal.
He may well be in jail before he can ever release this.

He very well could come up with something that is helpful, legal and successful. He may also end up in jail in the near future. He is currently appealing his extradition to the US to stand trial. If he loses that I have a feeling he will be going away for a little while (how long could vary greatly.)
My experience is that many people who end up being career criminals have the intelligence and ability to do legit things, but they are either lazy and take the easy, illegal way, or they just like the thrill of seeing if they can get away with it. Kim seems like an egomaniac. So far he has been able to avoid any real deep trouble, but that may change in the very near future.
If he doesn't go to jail (or even if it does when he gets out) I would love to see him put his intelligence and drive towards something good and legal.

but thats the whole pint, the actual currency can not be regulated.
We will see regulation of the exchanges/remittance/on off ramps, AML is a big deal for the government types.

its tough, lets say i own 8btc, and one day they go to $5,000.

@_date: 2015-05-22 12:47:00
You need to stop waiting for a single event to happen, no one thing will raise the price. We heard the same story with GBTC, NYC Hearings, Overstock, Russia ban, China Ban, New Years, etc etc
The time for huge price increases are over, it looks like just slow mass market growth is what comes next, hopefully long term and stable. 
And if it does go moontime, it will need a perfect storm of international events to reach the next bubble phase. Think of something like Greece defaulting and EU not helping and the banks seizing all assets, while at the same time the FED says something nice and also linen paper causes cancer.

Let me give you an example: 
I get an email asking if I sell bitcoin, I say yes, list the price and ask how many she needs. She replies back asking me the price yet again, so I reconfirm the price for her. Then she asks me how much it will cost in USD to make a posting, I tell her it all depends on the ad she creates (bp has a fee schedule based on cities and autoreposting). She insists I tell her how much it will cost in USD, i tell her I paid $4 but that's just based on my ad. She then asks how much is a basic ad with no extras, I tell her that has always been free. She replies again telling me that I am refusing to answer her questions and to have a good day.

Who the hell are you anyways?
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:36:23
I disagree on two points. 
First off, bitcoin is nowhere near becoming a popular technology, a tough crackdown by several key countries will effectively end it.
Secondly, you wont have any kind of mass adoption without big government embracing it, the average person on the street has no problem using local currency, thats why the system is working. And in places where that changes and isnt true, its already too late for them to adopt bitcoin, like Greece. Think about the average 40yr old person in a western nation, do you really think they would risk jail/fines over an ideal? We are way too soft for that...

When everybody behaves, mortgages benefit everyone. The borrower can buy a house, the bank has a relatively secure investment that he can use to pay interest to his depositor. 
In the case of deflationary currency, the payments will be worth more than the house. The loan will be extremely difficult to keep up with

If these services really cared couldnt they generate a new hot wallet for all their users every 50btc or so? Should be fairly easy to automate. There isnt really a reason to make a main hot wallet if you think about it, addresses are alot easier to create and manage than a bank account, i dont see why every user shouldnt have their own hot address

I feel my purpose in life is to help the world understand one another, to be free of detrimental hurt for the lack of understanding! I feel there is a need for a person who is hurting someone to live that persons life in their exact environment for 24 hours! Whether it be racism, the person making racial slurs and hurting others may benefit from walking in town as a Muslim to understand the stares they receive. If its homeless individuals or poor person, try to live on a small budget and understand how they got there. I could go on about how others would benefit simply just by walking in someone else's shoes per se. The current election, I am thrown back by the hate crimes or using our words to hurt others in comments. I feel anyone along with counseling can change for the good and not live in defeat, racism, and hate! I want a world where there is no judgements against the disabled, poor, race, the emotionally broken by past abuse, women, and just anyone who is "different"! I believe everyone has a heart and just needs to learn how to get in touch with love and learn how to live without judgements! I am one person but I want to change the world!
